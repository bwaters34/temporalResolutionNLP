 honour: expressing to the life, what proprieties best concord w  th so exquisite a Maister-piece. It is observed, that all the Roman Emperours were singular in some peculiar Art, Science , or Mystery : and such of the Patricians as could not derive their native descent (w  th the particular relation of their Ancestours most noble Actions ) were thought unworthy to arrogate any thing to themselves by their Vertues. These Romanes were truely Noble , bearing their owne Annals ever with them, eyther to caution them of what was to be done, or excite them to prosecute what was by them commendably done: nor knew they Honour better limned, or more exactly proportioned, then when it was beautified by the internall Ornaments of the Mind. Many I know ( my good Lord ) whose greatnesse is derivative from their Ancestours unto themselves, but much Eclypsed by their owne defects: and plants which had a Noble-Grafter , use now and then to degenerate. But so apparant is Your Lustre , it borroweth no light but from your-Selfe ; no eminence but from the Lampe of Y our Honour ; which is ever ready to excite the Vertuous to the undertaking of labours wel-meriting of their Countrey , and generally profitable to all Estates . In Subjects of this nature ( my Honourable Lord ) I cannot find any more exact then these Surveies of Histories ; many we have depraved: and every lascivious Measure now becomes an Historian . No study in his owne nature more deserving, yet more corrupted none is there. O then, if those ancient Romans (Mirrours of true Resolution ) kept their Armilustra with such solemnity, feasts celebrated at the Surveyes of their weapons : We that enjoy these Halcyon dayes of Peace and Tranquillity , have reason to reserve some Time for the solemnizing this peaceable Armour of Histories ; where we may see in what bonds of Duty and Affection we are tyed to the Almighty , not only in having preserved us from many hostile incursions, but in his continuing of his love towards us. We cannot well dijudicate of comforts but in relation of discomforts: Nor is Peace with so generall acceptance entertained by any, as by them who have sustained the extreamities of Warre . Many prcedent experiments have we had, and this Isle hath tasted of misery with the greatest; and now revived in her selfe, should acknowledge her miraculous preservation, as not proceeding from her owne power, but derived from the Supreame influence of Heav en ; whose power is able to Erect, Support, Demolish , and lay wast , as he pleaseth: Hinc Timor, Hinc Amor ! Hence wee have arguments of Feare & Love! Feare from us to God; Love from God to us : Cause we have to Feare, that subject not our understandings to the direct Line and Square of Reason , but in our flourishing Estate (imitating that once renowned Sparta ) who was--- Nunquam minus f aelix, quam cum faelix visa \---; Abuse those excellent gifts we have received, contemning the menaces of Heaven, and drawing upon our selves the viols of Gods wrath , heavier diffused, because longer delayed. We should re-collect our selves, and benefit our ungratefull minds with these considerations: that our present felicity be not buried in the ruines of a Succeeding Calamity. These Histories (my noble Lord ) be the best representments of these motives. And in perusing Discourses of this nature (next to the Sacred Word of God ) we are strangely transported above humane apprehension, seeing the admirable Foundations of Common-Weales planted (to mans thinking) in the Port of security, wonderfully ruinated: grounding their dissolution upon some precedent crying sinne , which layd their honour in the Dust , aud Translated their Empire to some ( perchance ) more deserving people. Here Civill Wars, the Originall causes of the Realmes subversion: There Ambition bred by too long successe: here Emulation in Vertue , the first Erectresse of a flourishing Empire : There Parasites , the Scarabees of Honour , the corrupters of Royally disposed affections , and the chiefest Engineres of Wrack and confusion , buzzing strange motions in a Princes Eare, occasioning his shame , and their owne ruine . Here States happy, before they rais'd themselves to the highest type and distance of happinesse . And generally observe we may in our Humane Compositions , nothing so firme as to promise to it selfe Constancy , so continuate as to assure it selfe perpetuity , or under the Cope of Heaven , any thing so solid as not subject to Mutability. This Survey (my Lord ) have I presumed to Dedicate to your Honour , (sprung from a zealous and affectionate tender) not for any meriting Discourse which it comprehends, but for the generality of the Subject : and Native harmony wherein Your Noble disposition so sweetely closeth with it. Your Protection will raise it above it Selfe, and make me proud to have an Issue so highly Patronized : It presents it Selfe with Feare , may it be admitted with Favour : So shall my Labours be in all duty to Your Honour devoted, my Prayers exhibited, and my selfe confirmed Your Lordships wholly , Ri. Brathwait. SOVTHAMTON; The fruition of Her Divinest Wishes. From the Sacred Ashes 2 of your ever-Honour'd Lord, whose Memory lives in the hearts of Men, while his better part Shines in the Courts of Heaven, is the Breath and Birth of this Worke derived. At first addressed it was unto Him living; and now presented to Your-Selfe, the Vertuous Survivour of Him. Nor can it expect ought lesse from You then a New Life, who so constantly retaines in You the memory of his Love. Jewels are valued by their Lustre: Labours of this nature by the Test, and approvement of the Reader. Deagne, Madam, to accept it, for his Sake, who did so highly prize it: So shall Your Honour ever oblige him, whose vowed zeale hath really confirm'd him Your Ladiships in all humble observance, Ri. Brathwait. (in my Judgment) seemes much disparaged. I have ever resolved to have this Motto: Catoni solus dormio : But where that Cato is, there's the difficulty. Hee is too heavy for the Court, too Wise for the City, and too precise for the Countrey. If my Booke chance to finde him, I know my Subject shall be entertained, and my Petition shall be heard, for, Auriculos Asini non habet \--- To give my Labour but impartiall censure. How studiously, copiously and usefully this last Edition hath beene Enlarged, may appeare by Digits or Signatures in the Margent every where expressed. Understand thy selfe, Reader , and thou understands me: If thou battle at Ordinaries, thou art not for me, thou hast thy Wit in the Platter: for I never knew him wise, that only delighted to Fare well. R.B. OR, A Nursery for the Gentrie. probable Collection of things to come, by precedent events: I thought good compendiously to contract some especiall Caveats, as well for observance in Historicall Discourses, as for prevention of such inconveniences  3 (or exorbitances rather) as happily might occurre in such Narrations. First therefore  4 I have propounded to my selfe this Method, (by way of inference) to Describe the true scope at which all Histories ought to ayme, and to  5 which, they should principally be directed. Secondly, to distinguish of severall uses and Fruites of Histories: The end whereof being exactly set downe, a dijudicating power may easily collect  6 from what Subject the choicest and selectedst Fruits may be deduced. Thirdly, the profit which redounds to every State, either Aristocraticke, Democraticke, or Monarchicke, by the true and understanding use of Histories. than a true Narration of what is done, or hath beene atchieved either in Forraigne or Domesticke affaires; with a modest Application (for present use) to caution us in things Offensive, and excite us to the management of imployments in themselves generous, and worthy imitation. For the true description of History, as it hath ever beene held the Treasury of Time , in which were laid up and deposit ed the Actions and glorious Exploits of preceding Worthies : As wee would be very loath, that any Evidence importing our private estates, should be either diminished or darkened: so much more, in what might consequently tend to the prudent mannagement of publicke Estates, to suffer the least obscurity, would argue in us either an apparant dis-esteeme of our Pr aedecessors actions, or a remisnesse in our selves, to neglect so spreading or propagating a Seminary; which, as former times recommended to our care, so should it be our care by a discreet circumspection, to preserve. Let us then reflect a little upon the Vtility of it, besides those incomparable delights, which to a modest and serious judgement, are highly reputed. First, should these Annals perish, what more could the merit or approvement of Vertue gaine to her selfe, but what the injury of Times usually throws upon deserving personages, Oblivion ? No difference betwixt the desperate attempts of an impiously-audacious, and odiously-persidious Cateline , and a noble State-affecting Vtican . Nay, we should lose those Eminent Types and Copies of all imitable Morality, should wee in rubbish bury the Surviving Records of History . We shall heere see, what even Morall Naturall men observed, and how constantly they stood in defence of what their glorious lives have proposed. No danger so apparant, no threat so truculent, no Opponent so over-awing or violent, which could weaken their Resolves, or make them Recreants to their just Designes. The whole progresse of their Lives, as it was a continued Line, whose period ever closed with Honour: so were their Deaths no lesse memorable, and in their setting sent forth the best lustre. How sweetly then relish these Discourses to a retired Spirit? who, withdrawne from imployment either through infirmity of Age, weaknesse of Health, or dis- respect of Time, may take a full Survey of what ha's beene done, with a  7 comparable Relation of what is now done: and so by conferring Persons and Actions preceding, with those now in present enjoying, may collect the vicissitude of times, and become an Agent by reading, what they could not aspire to by personall action. And with what easie sweetnesse may this be acquired? With what a pleasing privacy purchased? They need not expose themselves to the perills of a feare- surprized Campe, nor the furging billows of a raging Ocean: Their private Arbour may be their Centinell; no Alarmes to disturbe them, no feares within, nor foes without to distemper them. And having taken a full and free perusall of former States, with the strange grounds of their rising, and their unexpected Catastrophes in their declining: what singular uses may they propound to themselves, by consideration had to the mutable and anxious Conditions of all times: seeing how even those Republicks, which promised to themselves most security, were enforced to runne into other channells, and to have their memories drowned in them, when they had mounted to the highest pinne and pitch of Felicity: And these to discourse of with a confident judgement, as if they had beene Actors personally in these Scenes: what usefull knowledge may it beget to themselves, what delight to their Hearers? Secondly, should these memorable Records be lost, which have onely power to keepe men alive, when seeming dead, and by the Revivall  8 of their Actions, to produce in stirring spirits a desire of emulating their Vertues, the very forme and Method of ancient governments, whose platformes have not a little conduced to the mannaging and marshalling of present Estates, should be utterly razed and extinguished. What excellent Law-givers have former Ages yeelded? what usefull Lawes have they enacted? How strongly these laboured to preserye, what their care had studied and published? How strichly moderate became many States, which discreet Sobriety ever redounded to their sueceeding glory? Nor did they, though their darkned Judgements could never reach to a true and infallible conceit of Eternity ; shew the least ostentation in the course or pursuite of their Actions, or State directions. Their desire was to expresse a real goodnesse, without erection of Statues to memorize them to after-ages. Honour they sought not, being conferred on them unsolicited, and disvalued by them, when freely offered. These, Histories commend and tender them to our observation, as Morall Presidents deserving our imitation. Can we then eye these, and conceive no desire of rectifying our selves. Shall Morall men, who confined their hopes to Elizian Chymera's ; outstrip us, who retaine in us higher hopes, and make Eternity our Spheare? Shall we peruse these without a glowing blush, when we consider what beamlings of a divine Intellect darted them selves on these, in comparison of that pure Diaphanicall light which so gloriously shines upon us: 9 He described History in a just modell and proportion, who tearm'd it the very Picture, Embleme, or Mirror of Mankind : wherein are to bee seene the perplexities and perills of Empires, and of the Church it selfe : upon Survey whereof, and an equall reflexe to our selves, we may learne how to demeane us in a modest way, both in respect  10 of a civill Society, and politick government, as likewise in the Church Militant; especially, by taking notice of our owne and others infirmities, bethinking alwayes of this, how that Divisions from what Origen or Source soever they spring, are not so soone quenched; and how for the most part, long continued Warres, and mutations of States are successively derived from one breach. These, former times have ever observed; and by their Observations happily succeeded. They made use of Histories , as principall directions for State-government. They collected what was imitable, and they reduced them to use. They found no State so secure from foes abroad, or feares within, as it felt not many times the hostile incursion of the one, as well as the private intrusion of the other. This made them more secur'd, because others mishaps kept them from holding themselves too secure. They observed the occasions of rising States, with the probable reasons of their decline. They found a period to the most flourishing Empires, and gath'red thence, (with a free and ingenuous acknowledgment, their dependance upon another more absolute independent power) no policy nor humane providence could divert, what that Divine Soveraignty had decreed. This the prudent'st and powerfull'st have seene instanced, and in this Worlds Theatre presented, and in the discovery of them have trembled. Foolish wisdome they found in whatsoever was humane: when many times, their owne strength became the ruine of their State; by converting their owne powers, and turning the edge of their owne Swords upon their owne bleeding Intralls; as if they had aymed at nothing more, then to lay their owne Provinciall honour in the Dust, and to raise a new fabricke of Estate to some other surreptitious Nation. What variety of Examples, Stories will afford us of this nature, I appeale to the Candid and impartiall Judgement of any pure or uncorrupted Censor. Againe, to take a view of the mutable condition of all States; and how Victorious Princes, whose Motto's seemed to vie with the Herculean Non ultra ; became eyther personall Actors of their owne Tragedies, or visible Spectators of their unexpected miseries: And therein more unhappy, because once happy, would afford no lesse matter of admiration, then motives of compassion. Mithridates that invincible Prince and incomparable Artist, even Hee, who had discomfitted in divers set battailes, Lucius Crassusus, Oppiun Quintus , and Manius Acilius , being at last overcome by Scylla, Lucullus , and utterly by Pompey , for all his Infinite Treasure in Talauris is , those many Confederate Princes which admired his Valour, interposing themselves to prevent his danger, and the ample boundiers of his Kingdome so largely extended; had for all this; his body (the poore remainder of so great glory) buried at the charge of the Romans , being,. sent by Pharmaces in Gallies to Pompey. Nor shall we have onely here presented as in a Chrystalline Mirror, these Tragicke Disasters of eminent Princes, whose falls, as they were steps to others rising, so were they excellent Lectures of Instruction to all ambitiously aspiring; but likewise the infelicity of such who adheered to them: yet, behold the misery of Greatnesse! Neither could others miseries informe them, nor their precipitious falls caution them, nor those numerous Instances of mutability recall them. Diadems were more attractive Objects than to be lost through feare, or rejected for a powerfull Competitor. Soveraignty is a taking baite; yet is it ever accompanied with hopes and feares. This caused Autonies Angel to be affraid of Octavius Angel. Albeit, some, whose solid Judgments or bitter Experience had wrought deeper impressions in their composed tempers, were so farre aliened from this conceit of admiring Greatnesse, or titular State, as they conceived nothing more miserable than to be so surcharged. Selenchus being King, and one of an extensive power, was wont to say, that if a man knew with what cares a Diadem was clogged, he would not take it up though it lay in the Streete. When the Romans had despoiled Antiochus of all Asia , he gave them great thanks, saying, they had rid him of many insupportable cares. This princely composure of affections wrought no lesse effects upon Dioclesian , who voluntarily relinquished the flourishingst Empire in the world. Nor can we esteeme any person more truely deserving Honour, than he, who can with a composed minde and cheerefull affection, as if he were ingaged to no such glorious yoake, suffer himselfe to forgo it, and retaine still the same spirit, when in the eye of the World he seemes most dejected. A Philosopher perceiving Dionysius to sit merrily in the Theater, after hee was expulsed 11 his Realme, condemned the people who banished him: Holding those more fit to governe States, who could moderate their affections, attemper their passions, and discover a cheerefull countenance in troubled waters. Neither were many of those ancient Hero es, so much transported with an ambitious desire of Soveraignty, as they were with the apprehension  12 of a glorious Victory. This made that fluent, but affective Orator, so much enlarge himselfe, in the recitall of those noble and memorable actions done by Themistocles and Epaminondas : which he continues in this ample Memoriall to their succeeding glory. "The Sea shall sooner overwhelme the Isle it selfe of Salamine , than it shall drench the remembrance of the Salamine Tryumph ; and the Towne of Leuctra in Bo aetia shall sooner be razed, than the remembrance of the Field there sought, forgotten; exemplifi'de in the prowesse of Themistocles and Epaminondas. Their aymes were confin'd to their owne Fame, or Countries Renowne: their ambition was not to governe, but to conquer; as others of more remisse and retardate spirits, rather to governe than conquer: which diversity of dispositions may be found portrayed to life upon the Survey of History. So as, it pleased the Orator to call History the Glasse, or Mirror of mans life; charactering the whole compasse of this Universe, the states of Princes, events of Warres, conquests of renowned Captaines, even all Designes, either publick or private, by a succinct Description, or Map rather, expressing every particular Affaire: and what (as a worthy Historian hath observed) can be imagined more worthy admiration, then in a safe and retired Port, in the Harbour of secure Rest, in our private Reposes, to see there a Prince beleagured with many Hostile Opponents, straight by miraculous meanes defeating them, and by his owne policy, (the supreme purpose of the Almighty) to plant himselfe in tranquility, where (as farre as humane Apprehension could reach) nought but imminent ruine could be expected: there a City by wise and discreet government wonderfully preserved: here amidst concealing or shadowing rather of the Conquerours exploits by his moderation in conquering, implies how he could beare his fortunes, if he were conquered. We may read no State in her selfe so secure, but may be shaken; exemplified well in Rome , the Governesse of ample Territories, and now made subject to those which were her subjects: No Prince of so prosperous imployments, so successive proceedings, or generall forces, but either vanquished at home or abroad: abroad by forraigne powers, or at home by his owne illimited affections; instanced in that great and potent Prince of Macedon , who (though Prince of the whole world) could not play Prince of his little world, being slaved to distempered passions. No City but sore harased, if not razed. Nor could that Italian Tryacala (which taking her denominate from the Greeke , comprehends all beauty) stand against the injury of Time, or withstand the battry of all assaults, which makes me taxe that City of Arrogance, (whereof Hyppolitus speaketh in his Booke of the Increase of Citties )  13 upon the gates where of was this Impresse ingraven, Intacta manet . To see these States so well and lively decoloured, cannot conferre lesse delight (being grounded on Vertue, where all true and perfect delights bee seated) than the Relation of the Troian Affaires (being made by so excellent and experimented an Historian as Ithacus ) delighted that chaste Greeke Penelope: Theseus Travels Ariadne , or Alcides Labours Omphale . But to the use of History. History being a Mint of profit and delight, the seasoning of more serious studies, the Reporter of cases adjudged by event, the enterlude of our haps, the image of fortune, the compendiary directer of affaires, the representer of humane successe, the infallible character (by colation had with things past, and things to come) of succeeding events: should not aime at lascivious stories, amorous subjects (unlesse by way of digression to smooth a serious discourse with a modest insertion of mirth) but to prosecute the argument of the History without frivolous Ambages, or impertinent circumstances. Affectation ill beseemes an Historian: For he should understand what office he supports; not any thing drain'd from his owne invention, but to performe the charge of a sincere relation. I approve of his opinion that thought, Invention to be least needfull to an Historian, but Disposition more than to any. It is sufficient for an Historian to expresse what he hath read or seene, truly, without concealing any thing, in partiall respect to any person, making truth the period of his discourse. The Philosopher thought a poore man was not to be an Historian: for necessity would inforce him to temporise and observe humors: Nor a rich man, for he had his eye fixed upon his estate, and durst not un-rip great mens errors, lest he should lose by his labours. But I disapprove his censure, and resell it with anothers opinion of the same sect: Si dives, de fortunis & infortunijs scribat, sic enim utriusque fortunoe sortem oequius ferat. Si pauper, de fortunis scribat, nt cum eas attigerit, melius eas regat & teneat . The error of judgement should not be appropriated either to want, or eminence of fortune: for so should we subject the inward to the outward, the intelectuall power to the externall varnish; preferring the eye of the body before the light of the minde. Yet to intermeddle in estates, so much as to disable them (by extenuating their powers) lessening their revenewes, or eclypsing their pristine honor and eminence, by mentioning some insuccessive events they have had by warre, or other occurrents, I wholly disallow it; proceeding either from private envy to the State, or from malevolent nature (unfitting for so good a professor) apt to sting all, because an enemy to himselfe and all. States should not be layd too open: but when occasion serves to describe the seates of Countries, Regions, &c. or to touch the manners and conditions of inhabitants, how they live, and to what trades most inclined, with whom they have commerce, or the like, will not derogate any thing from the Scope of an History , or any way imply a digression. It is thought (and that by the Authentick'st Historians) that C aesar , by the description of Volateranus , which he made of Britaine , declaring how the people were savage, and unapt for military discipline, the places of defence unprovided: and then shewing how fruitfull the whole Island was, replenished with all necessaries, was induced to take his expedition into Britaine , and to conquer it, though prevented by a Brutus , who, to rid Rome of his tyranny, restored poore Britaine to her liberty, for his journey was stayed by Death. Albeit, what soveraignty the Romans had in this Island, may appeare by those numerous Cohorts, Colonies, and Regiments disposed and dispersed throughout most places of consequence in this Kingdome. Besides those many different Coines, Monumentall inscriptions, ancient Sculptures and Impressures, all which confirme their long reside, command and plantation with us. Antiquities of this kinde are very frequent, especially in the Northerne parts; where sundry sorts of Mettalls, Stones, with much Art and Curiosity ingraven, are oft-times found in the ruines of some demolished Fort, or turn'd up with the plough-share; as an Urne, proportioned to the ancient Ovall forme, was lately found neare  14 to the Borough-Towne of Kendall : wherein were bones, some solid, others turn'd to ashes; all whice imply what neare society, and continued corrospondence they held with us. Nor should I with more free election or affectionate devotion, recommend any Stories to the Survey of our Gentry , than these, which informe them in the knowledge of their owne Soile: wherein they shall finde many memorable Relations, worthy their observance and retention. For, albeit we esteeme him no man of Travaile, unlesse he hath travers'd forraigne Countries, and conversed with them both in their Language and Manners: yet shall I ever hold this for an undoubted positive Doctrine; that should wee finde a man who had enter'd commerce with the whole World, could discourse of the diversity of all Tongues, and returne their proper distinct Idioms: yea, such an one, as had ingratiated himselfe by his Gentile garbe in the affection of all Estates; and in a polish'd formall discourse could tell you, how hee had seene Iudasses Lanterne at St. Dennisses , the Ephesian Diana in the Louure , the great Vessell at Heidelberg , the Amphi-Theatre at Vlismos , the Pyramids of Æ gypt , with the incredible manner of their Obits, the Stable of the great Mogol , or the Solemnities of Mecha : yet were all these generall Notions of forraigne States uselesse, being estranged from the knowledge of his owne Native Soile. Yes, should hee in large his discourse in all these, by expressing himselfe in such a Dialect, as might deservingly beget an Admiration in the Hearer, yet descending to his owne, and shewing himselfe most ignorant, wherein hee should be best experienc'd, he could merit no lesse than just reproofe: in so undervaluing his owne, as to publish himselfe sufficiently read in all places but at home. An English fault I must confesse; whose condition it is to admire nothing more, nor with an eager affectation to pursue ought more, than the fancies and shadows of Strangers: Whose fashions bee they never so unbeseeming, they cannot want our imitation, because introduced by a strange Nation. These resemble Painters, whose Art it is to make faces, but to forget their owne. Nor is it my purpose in this, to taxe the commendable Travailes of such, who with much danger and hazard have improved their owne knowledge, and benefited others by their undertakings in assayes of this nature. Travaile I know to be the most accomplished ornament of a Gentleman: enabling him both for businesse and discourse: but to travaile so farre from our owne, as to make our selves strangers to what neareliest concernes us, argues a neglect in our selves, by a contempt or dis-esteeme of our owne. Wee shall read in all Records of antiquity, with what heate and height of desire, all such persons as interessed themselves in compiling any Historicall relations, ever pitcht upon description of their owne Countreys: with a continuation of such Heroick acts, exployts, and designes, as might conferre a deserving lustre upon her. Meane time, it was not the least of their care to bestow an impartiall penne in the deblazon of every person or action. Their greatest ambition was, to magnifie truth: to cloath vertue with her owne native habit, and discover the deformity of vice, were the subject never so eminent, whereof they wrote. 15 Neither were these Tasks onely for masculine Spirits : for many eminent Ladies were usually vers'd in these studies, to their honours, and the admiration of their Successors. Zenobia after the death of Odonatus her deare spouse, though a Barbarian Queene, yet by her reading of both Romane and Greeke Histories, so mannaged the State after the decease of her husband, as shee retained those fierce and intractable people in her obedience: and in a Princely privacy reserving some select houres for perusall of History, which held good correspondence with her Majesty, she abridged the Alexandrian , and all the Orientall Histories: a taske of no lesse difficulty than utility, whereby she attained the highest pitch of wisedome and authority. The like inward beauty might be instanced in many other eminent Personages of that Sexe; whose excellent composures in this kinde survive the vading period of time; as that vertuous Cornelia , mother to the victorious Gracchus ; who, as she was an Exemplar or Mirrour of goodnesse and chastity, so by the improvement of her Education to her children, she exprest her selfe a noble Mother, in seasoning their unriper yeares in the studies of History, Poesy, and Philosophy. Next her, Portia, Brutus his wife; Cleobula , daughter to Cleobulus one of the seaven Sages of Greece . The daughter of Pythagoras , who after his death governed his Schoole; excelling in all Historicall discourses, which wee here so much commend; and afterwards erecting a Colledge of Virgins, she became governesse or guardinesse over it. What shall I say of Theano daughter to Metapontus , a disciple of the same Sect? What of Phemone , who first gave life to an Hero icke Verse: and in exquisite composures recounted the memorable actions and occurrents of her time? what of Sulpitia, Calenus his wife, who left behind her most soveraigne precepts touching wedlocke, with the relations of that age, in a most proper and elegant stile? And Hortensia daughter to that most famous Orator Hortensius , who for copiousnesse of speech, gravity or weight of sentence, gave a living luster to her lines, a succeeding fame to her workes? And Edesia borne at Alexandria , one of such learning, sweetnesse of disposition, as she was highly admired by those that lived in her time: and amongst other excellences, singularly read in Histories; then held a study worthy the entertainment of noblest Ladies? And Corinnathia , who is reported to have surpassed the Poet Pindarus in artfull and exact composures: contending with him five severall times, as may be probably gathered by the testimonies of the ancient, for the Garland or Coronet, usually bestowed upon such glorious followers and favourites of the Muses? And Paula, Seneca's wife, a Matron not onely improved by his instructions, but highly enriched by the benefit of her owne proper studies: ever reserving some choyce houres for the perusall of such relations as either in those or preceding times had occurred. So as, we may very well collect, whence the ground of her husbands sorrow proceeded, in bewailing the ignorance of his mother, not sufficiently seasoned in the precepts of his Father: by reflecting upon the abilities of his Paula , whose discourse either for History or Morall Philosophy, appeared so genuine and proper, as her very name conferred on her family a succeeding honour. Lastly (that I may not insist too long on these feminine Mirrors, lest they should taxe some of our Moderne Ladies of ignorance with other temporary errors) Argentaria Pollia , wife to the Heroicke Lucan , is said to have assisted him in the apt composure of his Verses: being no lesse rich in fancy, than he himselfe when most enlivened by a Po eticall fury. Nor did she restraine her more prosperous studies onely to dimensions, being no lesse conversant in Historicall relations, than Poeticall raptures. These, as they excelled not onely the most of their Sex, but the eminent'st personages of their time in a judicious and serious discussion of the fruits and benefits of History : so they deserve to succeeding times a just renuall of their memory: yea, some of their workes wrought singular effect in the most remisse and pusillanimous spirits of that time. For as in a Table we eye his feature, whom we doe here honour; whose representation conveighes to our heart a vehement desire of imitation, of whatsoever we know imitable in him: So History , the exact mappe or discovery of humane affaires; personates to us in lively colours, the modell of preceding times, with the dispositions of such persons as flourished in those times: which Survey begets in a manly spirit, an eager pursuit of their actions: considering, how fame is the constanst guardon of resolution. For as Themistocles walked in the night time in the open street, because he could not sleepe: the cause where of when some men did inquire, he answered that the same-dispersed triumph  16 of Miltiades would not suffer him to take his rest: So the relation of others actions begets a glorious emulation in every noble spirit. And (doubtlesse) there is nothing which inflames the minde of man more unto valour and resolution, than the report of the acts of their Ancestors, whose monuments remaining of record with this impresse: Non norunt h aec momument a mori , must needs stirre up in them a desire of imitation. Many examples I could produce herein, as the Trophies of Miltiades , inducements of imitation to C aesar : the acts of Achylles to Alexander , of Vlysses to Telamon , of the Greekish Hero es to Prymaleon , of Danaus to Linceus, Ægeus to Theseus . Many times (wee read) where a naturall defect and want of courage was seated, even a retrograde from the spheare of valor, there (though a barren seed-plot to worke on) by Historicall discourse hath magnanimity shewne her selfe in more perfect and reall colours, than if nature her selfe had implanted in that man a Native desire to fight; so powerfull is History in her selfe, where nature in her selfe expresseth small power. This discourse therefore should not bee imployed in any thing save in excitements to Glory, motives to warlike designes; since by it valour is quickned, a desire of honour inflamed, Countries fame dispersed, and monuments of never-dying glory erected: O then, who should so disallow the precious treasure of a refined discourse, as to mixe it with impudent  & scurrillous inventions; such fictions as are not onely in themselves fabulous, but to the unstaid Reader (of which sort we have too many) mortally dangerous? Which fables in my opinion fall among the impertinent & feigned Fables called Milesi ae ; only aiming at the depravation of manners, and the effeminating best-resolved Spirits. The ripenesse whereof (by such unseasoned discourses) become blasted before their time: O that the depravednes of these times should taint so generally approved study: making Histories meere Panygiricks (Poems of adulation) to insinuate & wind themselves into the affection of the Great, leaving the Scope of an Historian to gaine by their studious traffick. But let us returne to the office of a good Historian: He will not write but upon singular  17 Grounds, reasons impregnable; conferring with the best to make his narrations confirmed of the best: Hee writes the stories of Princes truely, without concealing their errours (by way of silencing them) or comment upon an History, annexing to it an unnecessary glosse. He will not be so engaged to any, as that he will bee restrayned of his Scope ; or so countermanded, as that he must of necessity illustrate vice; vertue cannot passe without her character: A good Historian will alwayes expresse the actions of good men with an Emphasis, to solicite the Reader to the affecting the like meanes, whereby he may attaine the like end. This was the cause, all the noble Hero es in ancient time did leave to posterity their acts to imitate: not so much for recording their owne memorable lives, as for the propagating their Countries eternall honour by succeeding Worthies. As those establishers of good and wholesome Lawes made themselves with their Countrie renowned: Mynos and Radamanth among the Cretensians; Orpheus among the Thracians; Draco and Solon in Athens; Lycurgus in L aecedemon; Zamolxis among the Scythians : Nor be Historians (if so the professors merit that stile) of lesse esteeme than the prudentest and most experienced Statists. For these direct every Senator in politicke affaires, by producing such as excelled in administration of justice; describing the very natures of such Lawes, and the causes why such Lawes were anacted to present times. True it is, that experience hath begot wisedome, and memory as a Mother hath brought it forth. This might be instanced in nothing more to life than in these Heroicke Actors , and Historicall Relators of what is acted. The former by an experienc'd hand and resolute heart not onely contrives but atchieves what may most conduce to the honour of his Countrey, and the succeeding renowne of his owne family. The latter becomes a serious, constant and competible Record to the former: by commending to writing whatsoever merited either approovement, or might justly lay an aspersion of dishonour upon the undertaker. For as the definition of History is to bee circumscribed by no straiter bounds, than these proper extensive attributes: "The witnesse of times, the light of truth, the life of memory, and the messenger of antiquity; so are all memorable actions of preceding times by her to posterity recommended: and these with the light of verity and perspecuity to be cloathed; that the life of those actions may bee better preserved, and antiquity in her owne native, though naked habite, presented. It is most certaine, that many excellent Patriots; whose sole honour it was to advance their Countries glory, though by their owne ruine; preferring her quarrell before their owne lives. have utterly refused to have any Statues erected in their memory: holding Vertue in her owne pure unblemished essence, to be a monument of more perpetuity, than all materiall structures, lyable to the period of time: yet did never any of them withdraw themselves from being recorded in these bookes of Fame: accounting them Earthly Elisiums , for memorizing their actions after death, which crowned their names with triumphall honours during life. Hence it was, that Cicero mov'd Luceius (one of a dext'rous penne, and confirmed fame) to record his acts in his writings: and Plinius Iunior wished nothing more than to be mentioned in the Histories of Cornelius Tacitus , because he did foresee their succeeding memory. Now, to insist a little upon that rich and unvaluable Trafficke, which these our late-declining times have had with their predecessors: we shall finde, that as former States received much improvement by the relation and recollection of forraine Lawes, which being made, by a discreet use and reduction of them, more proper and peculiar, highly advanced those Municipall States where they became established: So even our own times, though refined, and by collection and collation of many Lawes, with election of the best, breathing nothing else than an absolute state of government, neede not to be ashamed to make use of some especiall Lawes enacted and duely executed by Ethnicks, both in meat, drinke, and attire. For the first, the Spartans held it no derogation nor dishonour to them, to conforme themselves to the Laconian Order, strict, but healthfull; proportioning such a measure both for meat and drinke, as Lessius himselfe, had hee lived in those times, might have seene his owne physicall directions so punctually observed, that nothing could be to life better portrayed, than to behold so temperate-abstemious a course generally practised. And to deterre others from too loose and luxurious feeding; it was their care to erect sundry Statues or Images, to represent the fatall fearefull ends of such, who expos'd themselves to riot. As the feature of Heliogabalus , the effeminate Sardanapalus , the unbounded Ericthous , the insatiate Cambletes , whose infamous life clos'd itselfe with as ignominious a death: for this gluttonous Lydian King having in a Dreame devoured his wife, while she lay sleeping with him together in the same bed; and finding her hand betweene his teeth, when he awaked, he slew himselfe, fearing dishonour. Which Modells portrayed not onely to life, but explained by proper Impresses, wrought wonderfull effects in the taking Spectator. For as that Rhetoricall Improver of his  18 . Countrey, and Reviver of her Language, was wont to say; There is nought that can bee taught without example : whence it came to be a custome amongst the ancient Lacedemonian Fathers, to present their Eliotes , or slaves in solemne Festivalls ![](/images/inline/sb.gif) ![](/images/inline/Eacgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . before their children, to act all their Obscenities by action, gesture, and every unseemely or undecent posture, to deterre them from Drunkennesse, and other bestiall qualities incident to that vice. For the second, so cautious were former times of their Honour, and so fearefull lest they should darken that divine lustre of the intellect with that broad-spreading Tetter or Deluge of liquor: Plato reports, that Kinswomen used to kisse their Kinswomen, to know whether they drunke Wine or no, and if they had, they were to be punished by death, or banished into some Island. Plutarch saith, that if the Matrons had any necessity to drinke Wine, either because they were sicke or weake, the Senate was to give them licence, and that priviledge might not be admitted in Rome neither, but out of the City. Macrobius affirmes, that there were two Senators in Rome chiding; and the one called the others Wife an Adulteresse, and the other his Wife a Drunkard; and it was judged that to be a Drunkard was more infamy. Such strong impression had their Lawes, and the life of those Lawes, which is Execution, wrought upon them, as nothing became more  19 dishonourable than this odious vice; and Heavens grant, that it may be no lesse disrelished by us, who weare a far more glorious and honorable Cognisance than these Ethnicks ever attain'd to. For the third, they hated nothing more than light-phantasticke habits: They were constant in their attire; their Trafficke was not to ingage their Countrey to forraine fashions; nor foole the State with Fowles feathers. It was not one of their least cares to prevent all occasions of too sumptuous apparell in persons of all conditions: but by all meanes, to reteine a seemely distinction or difference betwixt men of quality, and those of obscurer ranke. Yea, Histories will deliver to us what especiall observances were used in all these, with the penalties inflicted upon such delinquents as were refractory in any of these. Now, a reflexe upon these, should induce us not onely to conceive all gorgeous attire to be the attire of sinne, but to observe that decent forme, or rule of distinction in our habit, that we may become exemplarie unto others, by making use of what we have read: never holding it any derogation to receive any life of Instruction from others direction, though their Transcripts were onely Ethick, and shew'd not in them that fulnesse of beauty, which now so clearely shines upon us. These Ages have beene, and are to this day,  20 . much indebted to Transcriptions. Inventions are oft-times slow, where the application of things invented to the present State seemes more facile and easie: Hereto then should the Scope of Histories tend; not onely to personate the Acts of men upon the Theater of this world, but likewise to cull out such Lawes, Orders, and Precepts, as well Morall as Divine, which may benefit their present estate. Sysambris skin was a  21 . good caveate for succeeding Judges: Justice before went on crutches, and more were troubled with Demosthenes disease than with Phoycions bluntnesse. The Historian must not sow pillows to the elbowes of Magistrates, nor sooth corruption with an humour of shadowing vice: He shows what was done: and commends the one to reprehend the other. Vertue never wants her Character, nor vice her reproofe: For such Historicall Relations as induce to vertue, and deterre from vice, comprehend in them the true use of such subjects, being Apologeticall and Morall to reforme, not Mylesian or prophane, to deforme or disfigure the exact Symmetrie of a vertuous Idiome.  22 No marvell if Alexander laid the workes of Homer under his head, being such as directed him to be a Head, how to governe Provinces, how to sway his inordinate affections; so as Cleanthes Table (Vertues best elucidary) had her Liberall Sciences never better portrayed, than the differences 'twixt true Fortitude, and a foolehardy boldnesse were by Homer deblazoned. Here a Hector , badge of true valour; there an Antenor , whose gravity purchas'd him honour;  23 there a Diomedes , no lesse wise than resolved, here a Troilus , stout enough, but unadvised; here warres well managed abroad, but lesse successive at home, exemplified in Agamemnon ; there a subtile sconse, no lesse fraighted with policy than successe, in Synon . All these are expressed by that Hero ick Historian. Qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non, Plenius as melius Chrysippo & Crantore dicit. These acts could not but minister sufficient matter of admiration to such Judicious Readers, as apprehended each circumstance in the subject; making that apt connexion of all, that the body might seeme more excellent, by the proportioning of every member. 24 Histories in themselves are diverse, producing severall fruits to the perusers, according to every mans affection: which made that Moderne Historian compare them to a Banquet, wherein were to bee served severall dishes; some to provoke appetite, others to satiate; more delightfull subjects penned for relishing more serious studies; graver discourses to ripen the understanding, by applying the instructions of forraigne States to our owne judgements: where we may make use of the best part of man (in his reasonable power) and that is Election: approving of what is good, or may in it selfe be beneficiall to the State: and slightly observing discourses of indifferency, as accomplements, ceremonies, circumstances, and the like, resembling faire frontispices which are made rather for ornament than use. apprehend what is fittest for his discourse, and to be as little complementall as may be, lest the varnish marre the worke; for the words of an Historie in my opinion jumpe with Mirandula:---Vt non sint lecta, ita nec neglecta : the one implies a kind of  25 dejection, the other a minde too curious to profit any, desiring onely to please himselfe. C aesar in his Commentaries, sheweth no lesse discipline in the Art of History, than in the discipline of Armes: using a stile as wel fitting a Souldier, as curiosity the smooth tongue of an Orator. It is true which was observed of him: Si acta eius penitus ignorasses, 26 per linguaa tamen militem esse diceres  : Having neither his phrases too selected (as to shew a singularity) or too neglected, to expresse a carelesnesse in his writing. Now, to propose a forme of Style , and what may best suite with the quality of an Historian; I will not arrogate so much to my selfe: onely let me in a word explode that which in the opinion of all such as have writ touching the Style , carriage, or office of an Historian, deserves reproofe. For an Historian than to use too polish'd or terse a Style , or to play the Orator , when he should performe the office of a Relator , would not relish of discretion. Or to spinne out the webbe of his discourse in fruitlesse diversions, which rather perplexe the immazed Reader, than enlighten his understanding, implies either want of matter, or want of order. To goe on in a free and unaffected Style ; beseemes his person: proposing things done, as if they were ocularly presented: and albeit, it be not the happy fate of all Historians with the Princely C aesar and sincere Comines , to bee personally present at those Conquests or Discomfits whereof they write; yet by collections or intelligence many have composed, at least compiled excellent workes meriting no lesse improvement than if they had beene there in person present. And no doubt, though information cannot be so firme a ground to build upon, as a personall presentation of what is done: yet, being seriously intentive and sollicitous from whose relations they receive intelligence; using likewise a seasonable deliberation to try the issue or event thereof, before hee commit to publicke, what was delivered unto him in private: he may by his-owne diligence, with other accommodations, perfect what hee intends, and incurre few obliquities. I have knowne indeed, divers, who onely breathed their owne Countrey ayre: and never walked farther than their owne Pastures; to have writ with much confidence of forraigne Seats, the  27 government of their State, the barrennesse or fertility of their ground; the disposition of their inhabitants; their commerce with other nations. Their Lawes, Edicts, and Constitutions: all which by their industrious collection they have so laboriously reduced, so properly compiled, and and methodically digested, as not only the maine Basis or foundation whereon the whole Frame or Fabricke of their History subsisted, but the very circumstances, inferences, and illustrations confirm'd them Travellers in those Countries whereof they discoursed. This I confesse is a great felicity in an Author , and deserves a just guerdon for his labour. Albeit, should any one unawares converse with any of these touching the Site, Degrees, or Temperature of any such Province they have described: how miserably would they wander, and commit more errours in one houres space with their tongue, than a whole yeare could rectifie with their penne: Relations of this nature are so got by th' Booke, as their Remembrancer failes, when he is removed from his booke. Neverthelesse, it is not to be doubted, but that most of our ancient Historians whether Greek or Latine, have received their best helpes from others Labours: which may appeare by this, in that they wrote of such Persons and memorable actions as were many ages before their times. So as, not onely this disftinct study of History, but generally all learning hath beene highly beholden to Transcriptions (as I formerly observed) for otherwise had the most eminent'st Labours in all ages perished. 28 It is to bee admired, by what Divine providence the ancient Records of long- preceding times have beene preserved; especially, wanting those improving helpes of Printing; which, with what facility of Art, and felicity of Invention, have beene of late yeares to all Christendome recommended, I leave to the judicious to conceive, and conceiving to admire that peculiar benefit. The people of China , indeed retained as a memorable appropriate to their antiquity, a certaine forme of Cyphering, where of their impolish'd Art expressed some notions by stamps and impressions: but these were onely of use unto themselves, being so intricate and obscure, as it had beene a fruitlesse labour to have communicated them to any other, save onely to their owne Natives, without a knowing Interpreter. No doubt, but many excellent workes formerly composed by ancient Authors, with no lesse industry than felicity, both for Inuention 29 and Style , have perished: which might be no lesse probably than authentically collected by divers memorable pieces lost both amongst the Grecians and Romans . We make no question of Hortensius Eloquence, and that divers workes of his by the injury of time, have received that too common fate to Learning, extinction. Cordus , an impartiall and uncorrupt Historian; one who suffered for the Integrity he professed: reteining ever that honest resolution, that though the generall corruption of that time might truely conclude with Martial: Qui velit ingenio cedere, rarus erit. He ever scorned to comply with Time, or feed the humour of an imperiall Libertine, or licentious Governor. This man, I say, or man of men, expressed his courage most, when those vitious and depraved times appeared worst. Yet, no doubt, many of those select and approved Labours which he had so seriously compiled, and to an Historicall Method reduced, remaine now obscured. Many inimitable workes not onely in their Embrio , but brought to their full height and accretion, were written by that matchlesse C aesar , whereof wee have now scarce any semblance remaining. And whence proceeded this Tetter to Learning, but from the want of that which we in so accurate manner enjoy, the benefit of Printing ? The tediousnesse of Transcribing occasioned this injury; whereas, if the knowledge of the Presse had arrived there, all these inconveniences had beene prevented, those ancient Monuments of Learning, Martiall Experience, nay, of all Liberall Sciences had beene better preserved. Those poore Arcadian Shepheards, when they had no other meanes to continue the memory of their actions, or perpetuate their Loves, or recommend to posterity their Rurall Rapsodies, used to indorse their passionate Expressions in Rindes of Trees; which seemes pleasantly shadowed at by the Poet: 30 In barks of Trees Shepheards their loves ingrav'd, Which in the bole remain'd, when th' rinde was shav'd. So sollicitous were poore Swainlins to have the memory of their Pastoralls continued, as they used the best meanes they could to have them preserved. Now, to us is a farre greater priviledge granted: our workes may be kept to posterity without any fear of so  31 any feare of so menacing an injury. Stampt they may be with a firmer Impression, to continue their names to a succeeding generation. It rests, that as this benefit is conferred on us, we bestow our Oyle on such Labours as may conduce to the publick: reteining ever a vertuous scorne, to close in ought that may detract from goodnesse, or to smother vice in the visage of greatnesse. 32 It was a religious Fathers continuate occasion of griefe, which hee expressed in many devout aspirations and pious teares, to recall to minde those lighter and lesse consequent Studies, which his youth had affected, concluding with this passionate confession: " Those studies which I once loved, now condemne me; those which I sometimes praised, now disparrage me. Let us reflect on this: and become discreetly cautious what we write; what peculiar study we addresse our selves to; that our yeeres of age may not blush when they peruse those Follies in Folio which our youth published. True is that constant Maxime: Iuventus inventioni, Senectus castigationi aptior : How pregnant soever our wits be to invent; how rich soever our fancies be to conceit; how elegant soever our style to illustrate our discourse; if the Subject tend not to the practice of Piety; but onely suite with the quality of the time, exposing our Lamps to lucre, or to procure unmerited honour; our riper houres will bring us to a censure, and discover our follies in their owne naked and native feature. As then, we value our honour, or shall labour to preserve our memory to a succeeding age: let nothing passe under our Pen, nor receive life from our Conceit, but what with a discreet confidence we are assured of, that it may afford much benefit to that private or publick state to which it is addressed: and by a propagating power beget much profit in a conceiving Reader. It is an observable note, which one experienc'd in assayes of this kind, sometimes said, and to our present purpose properly applyed: "It is hard when the world shall shew mine infirmities under mine owne hand, said that knowing Roman . The way to free us from occasionall censure, is to conceale our selves from the world, who is many times a Lynceus to the lightest errour. Lateat h aec una salus , was wise Ithacus his counsell to perplexed Andromache ; and mine shal be the same to every Author, in this censorious Maze of opinionate phrensie. Now to the election of our Style. The Records of things done, commended to posterity, should not be enrolled, as the Chaldees did their Hieroglyphicks in Cyphers and intricate conclusions; but in words most significant, phrases modestly elegant, and discourse most pertinent. Here, by way of digression, let me touch the ridiculous labours, and unfruitfull travailes of such who passe the Alpes , trace uncoth places, Desarts, Promontories; for what end Heaven knows, save onely to wrest out a phantastick behaviour of superfluous wit, or to comment on others Travailes by way of dirision: These are such as upon their returne, publish what they have seene; some more than they have seene, which I tearme Commenting Travellers : others lesse than they have seene, (or at least the most impertinent) which I tearme phantastick Travailers . Such as lye on their Travaile, either doe it for admiration, or having run up o the adverse shelvs of a deplored fortune, are enforced to invent strange things for the reliefe of their dejected estate. Such as publish lesse than they have seene, (omitting things of the greatest consequence, to satisfie our humors with trifles) doe it to gaine pregnancy, or singularity rather of conceit: they talke not of the Acts of Princes, nor the Sites of Regions, the temperature of such Clymates, or any materiall discourse, but to shew an exquisite straine of wit, purchased by a little fruitlesse travell: they insert frivolous occurrents, borrowed, or (it may be) invented by their owne phantasticke braines. These misse the marke a good Traveller should aime at: they should observe Lawes in forraigne places,like a good Lycurgus , to transpose so glorious a freight to their owne Countrey. They should not (like our fashion-inventers, our Italianated Albionacts) so much observe what is worne on the body, as what habit best beseemes the nature and condition of their minde. Since flourishing Common-weales are then the highest, when in externall habilliments the lowest: for Sparta never flourished more, than when she conformed her State to the imitation of the Laconians . Many Realmes have we knowne to be miraculously protected, by meanes of experienced men: which experience they either received by  33 Travell or Example: yea, many Empires (and those of amplest circumference) have beene reduced from a kinde of servitude within themselves, by experiments derived from a farre. For Travell, the excellent designes of Sertorius, Eumenes, Marius , and Antonius , may sufficiently confirme the profit to bee reaped thereby For Example: We shall reade in all the Roman Annals, a certaine vehement desire in all the worthy 34 Patritians of imitating whatsoever they perceived to bee worthy imitation in their predecessours; marking the events of their intendments, and collecting the goodnesse of the meanes by the prosperous successe in the end. These were worthy monumentall honours, that could not only imitate the vertues so transparant in others, but even exemplifie their memorable actions in themselves. Wee are placed in the following Ages, but we scorne to follow the precedent times in their vertues, though expert enough in contriving politicke designes: the fabricke of our invention can dispose or transpose it selfe to any shape, any impression, for private gaine or advantage: but publicke affaires may be Advocates for themselves; they are a Merchandise too farre estranged from our affections; none will travaile to purchase their Countries peace: Solons we have few, that goe mad for their Countrey; but Tarpeia's we have too many, that are madde with desire to betray their Countrey: Few Lawinacters, many Law-infringers: making wholesome Lawes, like Tarandulas webs; wickers for great ones to come through, but snarles for little ones to hold. Those ancient Emblemes stood profest Antipodes to these injurious Spiders; whose desire is, that Iustice may still hold her comparison with the Celedonie stone, which retaineth her vertue no longer, than it is rubbed with gold. There were certaine Images of Judges, by report confirmed, and to their full proportions, with proper Motto's annexed, anciently rendred; which were set up at Athens , (at that time the select Seat of the Muses) having neither hands nor eyes: implying, that Rulers and Magistrates, to whom the civill sword of Iustice was recommended, should neither be infected with bribes, nor any other way drawne from that which was lawfull and right. Astr aea , the goddesse of Justice, was portrayed before them; her ballance hanging in an equall scale. The least deviation from what was just, ingaged the purple delinquent to an heavy censure. And this confirmed by the just and irrevocable decree of highest Emperours. Severus would have smoak'd such sellers of smooke. Zerxes would have pulled their skinne over their eares. This brought that flourishing-glorious estate to that spreading Empire in those happy dayes wherein Basil the Emperour of Constantinople lived; of whom it is reported, that whensoever he came to his Judgement seat, he found neither party to accuse, nor defendant to answer. I remember a certaine Modell of antick forme,  35 wherein were presented in Punick habits sixe grave personages, personating the office of Judges; each of them portrayed to the full body, and discovered by their distinct Posture and Impresse: The first, as one made up of impertinences, intending more the houre how it passed; than how businesse were dispatched, sate winding up his Watch ; and above him these words writ in golden Letters: Quota est hora ? The next to him, as one rocked asleepe, sate a grave Endymion , carelesse how the world went, or how causes proceeded: his onely reside on a bench, was to take a nappe, and with all indifferency to recommend the carriage of all businesses unto another, so he might without disturbance, enjoy his slumber; his Impresse, to answer the former: Omnibus dormio . The third, an imperious surly Saturnist , whose will was his Law; one, who scorned to veile to anothers judgement, though his opinion were more just: preferring his owne voyce before the equity of the cause: which hee makes good with as confident an impresse: Sic volo, sic iubeo . The fourth, a conceiving Sage, who heares all, but sayes nothing: appearing as one wonne by affection; or over-aw'd by command: or as one constantly resolv'd to comply with time, he approves with silence, what his owne knowledge dictates to him for unjust; and this he seconds in these words: Video, sed taeco . The fifth, one of a strong working pulse, more apt to receive than a common Shore. His Nerves were described ever extended; his Eyes fixt upon a visible object of approaching profit; and his Lungs nearely consumed with a close infatigable whispering of, Quid dabis ? The last, in a scornfull eying and dis-esteeming of their irregular courses; as one declining from their injurious carriage, which he conceipts unworthy the embrace of any sincere professant, who should make his life the line, by which others actions are to bee directed, others affections measured, concludes, Video & video . Truth is, Emblemes of this sort are held a kinde of representative Histories: and by so much more moving, in regard their features imply a more native and free expression, than if they were discovered onely by the penne without any other liniment. With pieces of this quality, many eminent and illustrious personages have been infinitely taken: instances here of are each-where to be found without seeking; and incomparably usefull in their applying. Protogenes his Table, wherein Bacchus was painted, (and with no lesse excellence was the Embleme contrived) moved King Demetrius lying siedge at the City Rhodes ; to use such intermissions and prejudiciall delayes in the pursuit of his designe, that where he might have consumed the City with fire, spared it for the preciousnesse and accurate workmanship of that Table: so as, staying to bide them battaile, he won not the City at all. We shall see in the draught of ancient Histories, not onely the actions and events of warres set downe; but likewise the Purprise of Forts, the Site of Cities; the manner of their defeats, in Pictures and other impressive Sculptures; which adde a great beauty and living resemblance to the History . This we may see in those time-surviving Commentaries of C aesar , and other Moderne Annals expressed, to which these digressive observations may be properly referred. vertue revived when her defender is dead: and to say the truth, I may use Thales sentence in this discourse: without History, Nilmortem a Vita; differre : Since the life of the dead depends upon the memory of the living: for without some memoriall of actions prosecuted, what difference betwixt the valiant acts of Ithacus , and the shamefull retirednesse of Æ gystus ? betwixt Æ neas piety, and Piginalions cruelty? they are dead, and their poore Vrne can speake no more for  36 them, than Pompey's Sepulchre spake for him Hic fitus coft magnus ! here he lyes that was once great powerfull in popular command, generally succesfull, before his Pharsalian discomfite: here he lyes that was stiled his Countries Patron, Romes best Centinoll: yet failing in the close of his fortunes, drooping in the upshot of his victories: Time can erect no other monument in his remembrance: Vixi, & vici : onely once I lived, and was once Conquerour. It is recorded, that when Alexander came to the Tombe of Achylles , and beheld the Mirrour of Greece , shut up in so small a scantling of earth, (a parcell of that whole which could hardly: containe him living) he wept bitterly, adding: H aeccine sunt Trophea ? Be these all the Monuments, all the Trophies this world could affoord thee? Is greatnesse so soone extinguished, and the lampe of honour so soone put out? A good motive for Alexander , to caution him of his mortality and might make up this conclusion: Alexander thou art not ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  but ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  : not the sonne of Iupiter , but the sonne of earth. The like wee read related by Quintus Curtins : that when this great Prince of Macedon came into Persia , an object of no lesse pitty, than example of humane frailty, represented it selfe unto him: to wit, the poore Sepulchre of that victorious Cyrus , on which be found no other Inscription than this: O man! whosoever thou bee or from what place soever thou shalt come (for I know thou wilt come) know, that I am Cyrus, who translated the Empire from the Medes to the Persians [illeg.] pray thee doe not envy me for this little handfull of earth that doth cover me . This Epitaph could not choose but fixe an impression of remorse and commiseration (as indeed it did) in that great Conquerours heart: seeing where to all his victories tended: So as Nero's affecting command and soveraignty was well answered by Seneca: Pulchrum est regnare , (said Nero:) Nihil est, sinihil qu aeras , replyed Seneca : Certainly (if I bee not blinded with the love of Historicall discourse) there is no meanes better to deterre from vice, nor more effectuall inducements unto vertue, than these morall relations. By them wee see the lives of Princes, and their imployments ( Prima specie l aeta ) in their first entrance or passage pleasant, and delightfull, promising no lesse than successe, and in successe, continuance: and afterwards ( Tracta dura ) more difficulties attending, as if the Wheele of Fortune were removed to a place subjected to more occurrents, yet not so dangerons, as to be attended by ruine: nor so secure, as to promise an undoubted issue. Eventu tristia ; a strange Catastrophe of so faire beginnings! where, in the first, there was security grounded upon more than hope: in the second, hope, though not secure: in the third, neither hope nor security, but deprivall of both. Yet even in these conversions, if it please the Reader to cast his eye upon the admirable moderation of some Princes affections, he shall see verily a Christian resolution in a Pagan.  37 Furius Camillus could not be daunted, (though unjustly censured) his exile neither made him dejected, nor his Dictator-ship prowd. Phocion , that honest Senator (to satisfie an unsatiate appetite of revenge) renders up his life willingly, and when he could not dye without paying for his death, so indifferent was life to him, as hee confirmed his resolution by this Epiphonema: Itaque nisi empta nece mori mihi Athenis non licuit ? To recount the vertuous lives and resolute deaths of the Cannij, Senec ae, Aruntij, Sorani, &c men of admirable tempers in so corrupt a government: what excellent divine precepts they proposed: what indifferency not onely towards Fortune but Life it selfe they shewed; how in integriously they bare themselves in place of honour; with what constancy they suffered themselves to be deprived of it, would strike amazement in any understanding man. Especially, having had no other helps but the light of Nature to guide them; nothing but an imaginary Conceit of fame to eternize them. Light veiles for so high designes. In those blind times, when States and Empires grounded their successe on Oracles; giving more credit to their doubtfull Delphian Resolves than any other pr aesage: with what preparednesse would their Generalls and Leaders grapple with the extreamest oppositions of death and danger? "No safety, nor hope of Victory either to State or Army, concludes the Oracle, if the Generall live: and rather than the State should suffer prejudice by his life, with open breast and cheerefull embrace he meetes death. Curtius leapes into the Lake; Cocles into the Sea. This suffers exile, and rejoyceth in his misfortune; that degraded, beares the same count'nance in his disgrace. Againe, observe those constant amicable contracts of friendship one made with another: how no perill could divide their affections: no interposed Cloud darken those rayes of Amity mutually reflecting: Histories are stored with instances of this kind, which deserve our memory, with an admiration of their immutability. Two especiall examples, amongst many others, Stories afford us, which are here inserted by us; briefly related, but to perpetuity memorised. The former is of Pelopidas that noble Grecian , who skirmishing with the Lacedemonians against the Arcadians , untill such time as being hurt in seven places, he fell downe at last for dead. Then presently Epaminondas (a mirror of constant Amity, in an hazard of such extremity) out of a princely resolution, stepping forth bestrid him, and fought to defend his body, he alone against many, till being sore cut on his arme with a Sword, and thrust into the breast with a Pike, he was even ready to give over. But at that very instant, Agesipolis , King of the Lacedemonians ,  38 came with the other point of the Battell, in an happy houre, and saved both their lives, when they were past all hope. Marcus Servilius , a valiant Roman , may supply the place of the latter; who had fought three and twenty Combates of life and death in his owne person, and had alwayes slaine as many of his Enemies as chaleng'd him man to man; when as the people of Rome , upon some private discontent, resisted Paulus Æmilius tryumph, stood up and made an Oration in his behalfe. In the midst where of he cast open his gowne, and shewed before them the insinite skarres and cuts hee  39 had received upon his breast. The fight whereof so prevailed with the people, that they all agree'd in one, and granted Æ milius Tryumph. Should we observe likewise what intestine and inveterate hate one Nation bare to another; where a new succession ever reteined that proposed revenge of their Ancestor, it would give us no little occasion of wonder: that small beginnings rising to greater heates, neither by continuance of time, which weares out greatest displeasures, nor mediation of interceeding States, could possibly be attoned. Variety of these, History will likewise afford us. When Annibal was a Child, and at his Fathers commandment, hee was brought into the place, where he made sacrifice; and laying his hand upon the Altar, sware that so soone as hee bore any sway in the Common-wealth, hee would be a professed enemy to the Romans . And that this grounded Nationall hate was not to be extinguish'd by death, may appeare by many eminent and pregnant Instances, not onely anciently but even of later times occurring. Scipio appointed his Sepulchre to be so placed, as his Image standing upon it, might looke directly towards Affrica ; that being dead, he might still be a terror to the Carthaginians. Zisca , that valiant Captaine of the Bohemians , who had borne himselfe so victoriously successive in many set Battells of incomparable consequence, commanded that after his decease his skin should be flay'd from his body to make a Drumme, which they should use in their battells, affirming that as soone as the Hungarians , or any other their enemies, should heare the sound of that Drumme, they would not abide, but take their flight. This was the reason that the body of Cadwallo , an ancient King of Britaines , (to draw nearer our owne borders) being embalmed and dressed with sweet confections, was put into a brazen Image, and set upon a brazen Horse over Ludgate for a terror to the Saxons. These in a private Arbour, secluded from the cares or turmoyles of the world, to peruse, cannot but beget a delight and admiration in the Reader. While hee collects the rare temper of some, whose alteration of fortune could not so much as occasion one sigh, or produce a teare. The Reason might be this, they were not so much enamoured on what they enjoy'd, and consequently could forgoe whatsoever they enjoy'd with lesser griefe. Servile teares become slavish mindes: whereas a truely ennobled disposition scornes to be restrained by such gyves. This benefit of Nature they enjoyed, and in such freedome, as losse of fortunes could not amate them; being seated on an higher Mount than the braves of so light a Soveraignesse could ascend to. These rightly conceived, and usefully applyed that Philosophicall Axiome: " As the Moone doth never eclypse, but when shee is at the full: so the Minde is never so much obscured, as it is with the superfluity of Riches . And againe, as the Moone is the furthest off from the sunne, which giveth it light, when it is at the full; so a Man, when bee is fullest of Riches, is furthest off from that Equity and Iustice which ought to give him light . Herein therefore (to free them from a more dangerous shelfe) they thought to imitate the Flie, which putteth not her feete into the great masse of Honey, but onely taketh or tasteth with her tongue so much thereof as serveth her turne and no more, lest by doing otherwise, shee might remaine taken and drowned therein.  40 For true is that sentence in every worldlings experience: Qui mundum amplectuntur similes sunt illis, qui submerguntur in aquis . This, through a constant moderation of their desires, moved Anacharses to refuse the Treasure sent him by Croesus: Anacrcon the Treasure sent him by Policrates : And Albionus the Treasure sent him by Antigonus. That Zeno prov'd himselfe a Philosopher indeed by his contempt of the World; who hearing that all his estate was exposed to shipwracke, with a pleasing smile, and a composed temper, farre above the braves of fortune, concluded: " Fortune bids mee now the sooner play the 41 Philosopher  . And as their Spirits were elevated above the Orbe of Fortune ; so could they with no lesse noble resolution suffer the misery of Exile, ever closing with that divine Morall: Si sapiens est, non peregrinatur; sistultus est, exulat. 42 Howsoever then the State, upon some immerited ground might pronounce their Proscriptions against them: their Countrey was wisedome; their true repose, a quiet composed mind, ready to suffer in defence of honour, and to hold it a prerogative of honour so to suffer. What should I speake of Publius Valcrius Publicola , whose moderation in the ebbe of fortune, and surplusage of miseries, made him more admired, than hated. The equall temper of Rutillias , the exceeding modesty of L. Quintius , the grave and serious respect of Fabius Maximus, the temperate deliberation of Marcellus , and the admirable government of Tiberius Gracchus ; the wise staidnesse of Metellus , and the discreet patience of Marcus Bibulus . We use to be more excited to goodnesse by Examples than Precepts; and such instances in Histories are not a little perswasive, representing to our eyes the divers objects of Piety in Coriolanus , of Justice in Aristides , of Prudence in Cleobulus : and to be briefe, of all vertues so well practised by Pagans, as they may well deserve an imitation by Christians. History: For contraction of sentences doth oft-times contract the sence, or at least makes the Subject lesse intelligible: Cornelius Tacitus seemed to affect an intricate kinde of writing, yet his Argument in it selfe so copious might modestly Apologize his succinctnesse; approving Tullies opinion, where he propounds, what errours are most subject to Taxing in such Discourses: Vitiosum etiam est st nimium apparatis verbis compositum, aut nimium longum est : Taxing in the one Singularity, commending in the other Brevity: Yet he seemes to oppose himselfe in it by plaine contradiction, making relation of the same Discourse: Non parum fructus habet in se copia 43 dicendi  ,  & commoditas orationis : But these tend rather to Rhetoricall Narrations, than Historicall Descriptions. Tacitus is to be preferred before the most, being a dilated compendiary of many declined States, dis-united Provinces: shewing the vices of the time, where it was dangerous to be Vertuous, and where Innocence tasted the sharpest censure: what garbe best suited with the state of that time, describing the Orators Tongue- Facundam inimicitijs , more partiall than Time-observers. Where Amici Cui ae , were Parasiti Curi ae : The Courts friends, the Courts Popingayes. Here he shewes a great Man rising, and his fall as suddaine as his erection: the immeritorious, in election for greatest honours; and the vertuous depressed, because they will not mount by sinister meanes. There a Prince that shewed great testimonies of his approved vertues, so long as he was subject, but raised to an unexpected height hee seconded this Conclusion: "An ill Prince spoyled a good Subject: so was Galba: Omnium consensu capax Impery, nisi imperasset : O what singular fruits may be gathered out of that one History, to teach men in high estates how to moderate their Greatnesse; and others of inferiour ranke, rather to live retired, than to purchase eminence in place by servile meanes? But of all, the divers affections  44 of Princes, either well or ill disposed, minister no little delight to the Judicious Reader: Here one so popularly affected, as he had the tricke to binde his Subjects to allegeance by a native insinuation; such was Augustus, Antonius Pius, Septimus Severus ; one whereof seemed rather to affect popular satisfaction than his owne, subjecting (as he himselfe professed) his entirest thoughts to propagate his Countries glory: Antonius Clemency, was the chaine that united and combined (in a knot inviolable) the hearts of the Romans to him, publickly protesting: Hee had rather save one Citizen, than destroy a thousand enemies . But Severus was loved (which seemes no lesse admirable) for that which engenders, for most part, greatest occasion of offence, and that was Severity; Being no lesse exact in punishing his friends than enemies. But to read over the life of Sylla , we shall see an opposition in his nature. None that ere did more good to his friends, or more harme to his enemies: Nay, even in Brothers (derived from  45 one Stemme) discrepant natures; Titus , the love and darling of Man-kinde, Domitian a professed foe to all Man-kinde; the one banishing Parasites his Palace; the other a persecutor of flies. Those different dispositions of Romulus and Remus, Numitor and Amulius , how from one and the same stemme, branches of various natures proceeded. Againe, to observe with what a Religious Ethicke care, many eminent Princes erected Temples for their gods; how serious they were in observing those Ceremonies, which were Nationally used by them. How superstitious they were in their Oscines and Augnries; what constant performer of their words, were it either in private Contracts, or publick Conditions of Peace. What a  46 lasting brand, or surviving blemish was it to any Nation, that should be found guilty in this kind? What a Theta it was to the Carthaginians , to be stamped with that inglorious Title of F aedifragi ? How devoted and affectionately ingaged, those honest-morall Pagans were to Loyalty? Nothing more hatefull to them than Treachery. This caused Mithridates to take Manius Acilius, 47 one of the chiefest Embassadours of the Romans , and set him contemptuously upon an Asse, till he was come to Pergamo , where he put molten Gold in his mouth: reproving the Romans for taking gifts: or to betray the considence of their Countrey for rewards. The like is reported of Tarpeia , that disloyall Maid, who betraying the gates of the Capitol to the Enemy, onely upon promise, that they should throw her the Bracelets which they wore on their left arme, which they accordingly performed, but with other proper gages to recompence her disloyalty, throwing also their Targets, with which she was pressed to death. Neither were they lesse strict in punishing such, whom private and Oeconomick affaires shewed themselves disloyall. This appeared in that nobly disposed Enemy of Scaurus Domitius , who, when a certaine servant retaining to Domitius , came before the Judiciall seate to accuse his Master, hee sent him home to his Master with the Tenure of his accusation. These ancient Sages and Heroick Spirits clos'd not altogether with that Maxime Of loving the Treason, but hating the Traytor : For they hated to stoope to such basenesse, as to perfect what they intended, or dispatch ought that they designed by such odious and indirect meanes. Nor was a loyall-noble spirit ever seene unrewarded: perchance, indeed, the iniquity of time might be such, as those who merited a gracious aspect from their Countrey, might sometimes fall into disgrace by undeserving Offices, suggesting to the State what so usefull an Agent never thought: but this proceeded not so much from the ingratitude as the easie credulity of the State, in inclining to such groundlesse suggestions. This might be instanced in that unhappy Asdrubal ,  48 who to prevent the fury and malice of the people, incensed against him by unjust Offices, fled to his Fathers Sepulchre, and dispatched himselfe with poison: nor found their fury here a period: for from that vast structure of mortality, they dragged out his Carcasse, and cutting off his Head, put it upon a Speares point,  49 and bare it about the City. But this inhumanity must be imputed to that Democratick Government or headlesse Monster, where all things are usually acted by a blind precipitate will, without deliberation or advice. Whereas a knowing Prince, who measures the value of mens actions by the promptnesse or alacrity of those spirits with which they are done; eyes both the quality of the person and action: Nor can any designe proceeding from a loyall spirit, who stands ready to ingage his state, fame, and all for the honour of his Prince or Countrey, loose his deserving Guerdon; besides that high opinion or estimate of the Prince, whose Count'nance is his honour; whose Smile the reward of his labour. King Darius upon a time, by chance opening a great Pomegranate, and being demanded of what hee would wish to have, as many as there were graines in that Pomegranate? answered in one word, of Zopyrusses . Now this Zopyrus was 50 a right noble and valiant Knight, who, to reduce Babylon to the subjection of his Lord and Master,  51 and defeate the trayterous Assyrians , suffer'd his body to be rent and mangled: and being thus disfigured, fled straight-wayes to Babylon , where the Assyrians were intrenched: whom hee made beleeve that Darius had misused him in this sort, because he had spoken in their behalfe, counselling him to breake up his Siege, and remove his Army from assaulting their City: They hearing this Tale, and the rather induced to thinke it true, because they saw him so shamefully disfigured in his body, were perswaded to make him their chiefe Captaine. By which meanes he betrayed them all, and surrendred both them and their City into his Masters hands. Such an Adamantine tye to his Princes heart was a loyall Subject, who little car'd how hee were brought to the stake, so hee might advance the honour of the publick State. What more delightfull Subject can be imagined, than to converse (and that without perill) of the dangerous events of Warre? of the divers dispositions of Princes, raisings and razings of Empires: Some shaken by the vitiousnesse of the  52 people which inhabite them, being so long secure, till ruine impose a period to their security:  53 Some by (civill and intestine Factions) making their dearest Countrey the sad Spectator of their Funeralls, their entirest friends, their professed foes; and the argument of love and amity, the ground of civill diffentions: The cause whereof (for the most part) proceeds from a continued peace; for retirednesse from forraigne affaires, make us bent to prosecute Managements domestick; and the over-flow of successe (purchased by peace) makes men more capable of injuries, even to their best friends. This was the reason moved Athens to erect places of Martiall Exercises, (even in peace) that so the Youths being dayly inured to such Exercises, might imploy their strengths in them, and not in civill Commotions. This wee have by relation of Histories, which so manageth affaires of State, as I am of  54 that Sages opinion, who averred: That no man could be an experienc't Statist, that was not initiated to the reading of Histories; which hee confirmes with reasons no lesse Authentick, calling them the aptest and exquisitest directions that can attend man, either in publick or private affaires, at home or abroad. Divers therefore of our famous Senators in Rome have employed their times in these Studies; as Salust. whose wel-couch'd Style, succinct Sentences, and purenesse of Writing, may arrogate, if not the chiefest place; yet to be inserted amongst the chiefest: Varro one of reputed esteeme, and of ample possessions, tooke in hand the like taske, to illustrate his Native Tongue, not onely with apt and accommodate phrases, but likewise to compile the memorable acts of the Romans , and to reduce them into an exact order; to excite his Countrymen, by perusing the valiant attempts of their Ancestors: Eorum glori a inflammariad eandem virtutis exercitationem suscipiendam : To be inflamed and provoked, by their renowne and glory atchieved, to imitate them in the like. And there is nothing certainly that leaveth more deepe impression in a resolved minde, than the report of former exploits; Hearing this man by his industry and vigilant respect, to contemne all difficulties, oppose himselfe to all dangers, whereby hee might performe something worthy memory: Another (sustaining Herculean Labours) to purchase himselfe but a little glory. This man subjected to Sea-wracks, exposed to the mercy of the Winds, environed and hemmed in by imminent dangers; yet moderating his passions, armes himselfe against the perils of Sea, adverse Windes, the menaces of ruine, with resolution to endure the worst of Fates, ever meditating of that motive to patience: Noscere hoc primum decet, Quid facere Victor debet, Victus pati. It was the answer of an unama[illeg.]ed Captive, who slighting the insulting braves of him who tooke him: "Thou hold'st thy conquest great in over-comming me; but mine is farre greater in over-comming my selfe. Here was a conquest indeed, and such as deserve trophies of glory, to crowne him with perpetuity. The Scythes used to erect Obelisks or Squarestones upon the hearse of the deceased, answering in number so many as he had slaine of his enemies: Whereas, he that had not slaine an enemy, was not onely deprived of those Monuments of glory, but not so much as admitted to drinke of that goblet (spiced with his Ancestors Ashes) and used for an Health cuppe in solemne Feasts and banquets. O what memorable Signals of true fortitude deserves that undaunted Spirit, who can triumph in his owne discomfit: and fortifie himselfe with a prepared mind against all oppositions! The Vnicornes Horne being dipt in water, is said to cleare and purifie it. This will patience do in all  55 those troubled Waters which inclose a composed minde. These finde no griefe of so extensive a quality, which either time will not allay, or Death end. Though they be led in triumph, and exposed to all the miseries which a domineering Foe can put upon them; they can slight the braves and contemptible slavery of a proud Conquerour, and with a cheerefull smile entertaine the mutability of Fortune. Such as these, are Soveraignes in Captivity; and merit most applause in their imbracing of adversity. Besides this, they reflect with a discreete eye, upon what they formerly read: now their confinement affords them leasure to peruse what they have observ'd in the circuit of their time: and now in their new change or ebbe of fortune they finde no new thing happened. Those, whose Victories were numerous; Soveraignty boundlesse; could not so cut the wings of Victoria , as to make her their permanent Guest. They heare Antiochus at one time saluted both ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , and ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , a glorious Prince, and a furious Tyrant. They heare Pompey combred with honour, exclaime to see Sylla's cruelty; and being ignorant after what sort to behave himselfe in the dignity he had then attained, they heare him cry out: " O perill and danger never like to have end ! They see a Philotas aspiring, and falling; a Perennius conspiring, and perishing. They note Dionysius that Syracusan Tyrant to be so suspicious of his fall, so jealous of his Fate, as hee will not trust any Barber to shave him, but injoynes his owne daughters to learne that Trade, purposely to bee imployed about him. They heare the very same Dionysius asking the Wise men of his Court, which Copper they held the best; and they heare Antiphons ready answer to his question, that in his opinion, that was the most excellent, whereof Armodius and Aristogiton made the Picture of Pisistratus . Holding that Mettall the best, which kept a Tyrant at rest. These heare the Lydian King exclaiming against himselfe, and disclaiming of his owne Opinion, that felicity should possibly retaine any subsistence from mortality. These have found the best and principall'st blessing confirmed by the authority of Herodotus in Cleobulus and Biton, Trophonius and Agamedes , and that pithy conclusion of Silenus , who being taken prisoner by King Midas , paid this ransome; teaching the King, "The  56 best thing that might chance any man, was never to be borne, the next to dye as soone as might be. A rich ransome, surely! had that worldly deluded King made right use of it; for so had hee prevented misery before it fell upon him: and made that an occasion of his happinesse, which unthought of, brought him to a more sensible conceite of his owne ruine. "Those whom the Gods doe love (saith Menander ) dye young: yea, those they esteeme of most, whom they take from hence the first. To present these more impressive Motives of Worldly contempt, dis-esteeme of Life, Honour, or whatsoever this Sabble Theatre of humane vanity could afford, sundry Imperiall Princes endowed with spirits no lesse imperious, have contrived many Emblemes, with other Remembrances, purposely, no doubt, to avert their affections from so much idolatrising Earthly Majesty. Amongst which, you shall finde in these rich Treasures of Time, Historicall Records, an Agathocles , though a Tyrant, Emblematizing his owne fraile and mutable condition in the invention of his  57 owne Statue: commanding the Head to be made of pure Gold , implying his Regall Dignity; the Armes of Ivery , signifying how Iustice from Execution receives her beauty; the other liniments of Brasse , inferring their strenuity; but the Feet of Earth , displaying their frailty. An excellent Memoriall, and well deserving to be ingraven in purest and perpetuall'st Mettalls. This Simonides sung to Pausanias ; this a  58 Page every Morning to Philip of Macedon: Respice post te, hominem memento te. Cineas , that excellent Orator, and solid Philosoper, disswading Pyrrhus from his expedition against the Romans , demanded of him, "what he would doe, when he had conquered them? To whom the King answer'd; I wil over- run all Italy, Greece & Barbary ; and what shall we doe next? I will forrage Cicilia . And what remains to be done then? O then, saith the covetous Prince, we will live at ease, Eate, drinke , and be ioviall together every day. And why, (said Cineas ) may we not eate, drink, and be merry with lesse , enjoy what we have with comfort ; and eschue those inevitable labours and perills, whereto our ambition and insatiable desire of honour ingage us? But this was too hard a question; Ambition can admit of no Reason. He onely h'as absolute power to confine his desires, who seeth nothing without him, which he conceives worthy of him. Such an one h'as measur'd Mans life, and hee 59 findes it to be a span; which hee shall neither fall short of, nor exceed, no not one title or point of it; not the breadth of the smallest haire, or Atome ; no, not the rare-spun Gothsimere ; the subtilest linke of the Spider; or any other extenuated  60 or imaginary thinnesse whatsoever. He calls Death and Sleepe two Sisters; and Night the Mother of them both. Hee holds the Locust or the Grashopper (though Creatures of emptinesse and feare) no greater slaves of the winde than Man: yea, to set him out in his colours, and discover to the world, that his vanity ranks him with the lightest of Gods Creatures: Hee findes him tossed to and fro as the Grashopper , and driven away as the Locust . Hee observes, how the Sunne, when it is in the Meridian , and the beams of it perpendicular to our bodies, shadows change not suddenly: but when it begins to decline to the fall, every moment, almost, they vary. And such hee concludes, is Man; who, though in his strength and maturity of Nature, he find no such changes or alterations in the state of his body, as may seeme to menace to his declining house an approaching ruine: yet, that curious and delicious structure, that earthly contexture of man, when it shall begin once to decay, and loose his former strength, every day brings forth a change. One infirmity or other hourely invades him; and at last, so weakens his poore splitted vessell, as no truce will be admitted, no respit granted, hee must of necessity returne to those first materialls , from whence hee first proceeded. Wee see the Crowne of Honour set with great solemnity upon the head, but wee feele not the weight of it; which makes him sweat and shake hands with Rest that weares it. Wee behold the golden Pantofle, but feele not how grievously it pincheth the foote. We eye and admire the reflecting beauty of a massie-guilt Target, or imbossed Armour, but partake not of his burden, who is the wearer. The greatest Worldling ever carries the heaviest weight; the ambitious- aspiring minde ever harbours the most care: the enjoyer of Honour, the most feare. The scourge of Envy from below, and Ambition from above, doe hunt Honour to death. He enjoyes sufficiently, that h'as learn'd to be a Soveraigne over his owne passions: and to restraine the surging billows of an over- flowing will, to the command of Reason. No Principality like this: for it brings man to an higher Imperiall State, than all the deluding promises of this spongie world can possibly afford him. These Observations are Receipts, or Cordials against the maladies of Fortune: A man thus resolved, cannot be lesse than a Prince; for hee governes a Dominion more domineering, an Empire more imperious, a Diarchy, or Monarchy rather: having disconsorting affections, ever laying Siege and Battery to the Palace of the Soule, which moved Plutarch in his Morals definitively to conclude: That he who moderated his affections, was halfe vertuous; but hee that never past the bounds and limits of temperate motives, nor felt the deluding enforcements of vanity assaulting him, was wholly vertuous . But the Morals proposition was better than his conclusion: For no mortall (since the staine of his Originall Purity) could ever subsist so secure, or remaine so unmoveable, as never to be engaged to perturbations, the naturall attendants of Mortality. generall, of the use and fruit of History: having by  61 an (equall Diameter) determined the proper place and Centre at which such Historicall Relations ought to tend: I will descend to the division on of Histories, which may properly branch themselves into Divine, Discursive, Morall, Physick, or Mixt. For Divine, I will not comprehend them in my Discourse, being such as depend on their owne Arches, drained from the pure Spring of Coelestiall Wisedome, and therefore impossible to erre either in Action or Relation: yet necessarily (now and then) immixed with Morall Histories, because their weight may better poise in the Scale of every Judicious Reader, when he seeth Morall Discourse so well fortified, as by the Pillar of Truth. Albeit I approve of Hesiods 62 Words: Fabulous Relations should not, nor ought they to be authorized by Holy Writings : It was a  63 Pagans observation, and worthy ours: So should our prophane Pamphleters, restraine their libidinous writings more, and either write that which should propagate themselves a generall reputation, without derogation to the sacred 64 Writings of the Almighty, or silence their works; lest they should deprave many, for a private reward, or pedling gaine. More I insist upon  65 this, because too many have I knowne steeped in this promiscuous Subject, well read in Scripture, to wrest them, otherwise Babes and Sucklings; for they could not reach to the depth of such Mysteries, but onely touch them to corrupt  66 them. But their Cimmerian Cloud, when it shall be dispersed, and the Raies of a reasonable understanding to them exhibited: They will repent them, I feare it not, (and heavens grant that repentance be not like the after raine, out of season) of their prophaner mixtures. O let them turne their eye of consideration (whosoever they be) to the miserable end of Lucian, Cleander, Metrodorus , whose disastrous falls answered their blasphemous risings; contemning the Sacred Writ of Heaven, and prostituting their labours to the merited censure of confusion: But too much of them. Times are not so easie to be wained from their habit of errour, or induced to a course of more Sanctimony: Lampes and Oyly Studies were made fruitlesse at Epictetus death; his Lanthorne hung up (as a monument of his vertues) made a deeper impression in his Schollers, than all our Motives, Precepts, or Examples can doe in ours: that Age was more apprehensive of Good, this of Ill. Now to our Discursive Histories. Many  67 discourse without matter, onely descanting upon idle Theames: more observed for their idlenesse, than for any subject whereon they entreate: Such be foolish Phantasticks that spend their Oyle upon unnecessary Subjects. I have apprehended many of this vaine, but they shall be namelesse, talking of strange Horse-races, such as their barren Muse never conceived: others of Fabulous Histories, never found out by that Arch-Artist Nature, whence they derived their foundation; for such, I passe untouched, being such as they hardly conceive their owne writings. Discursiue Histories are either true or feigned:  68 If true, they comprehend in them a certaine ground, not onely fortified by a reasonable production, but also by the authority of such, whose Authentiqust Labours claime to themselves, a kinde of Authority without further proofe: Such wee read to be the Labours of Cornelius Tacitus, Titus Livius, Trogus Pompeis , and many others, whose Subjects confirme their authority: being such as represent the divers events of things done, by Historicall Relation, and Ocular Presentation. For divers of those worthy Historiographers have beene interrested even in such probable, and generally-allowed discourses by personall  69 presence, in the management of such affaires: as Commines , of all Histories (amongst our Moderne) most approveable, being an eye-witnesse of what he writ. And herein me thinkes, I should take occasion, to recommend an imployment no lesse delightfull than consequently usefull to such of our Gentry as are adidcted to Travaile , or Martiall 70 Discipline ; to have ever with them a Diary or Ephemerides of whatsoever they have at any time seene presented worthy memory, or acted in the time of their service or agency there. I should hold it convenient likewise for them to become their owne Amanuenses : by compiling and methodically disposing such memorable Observances, as occurre either at home or abroad. This  71 course will recompence their few houres labour, to their great improvement; and in arguments of Discourse minister no small delight to an understanding Hearer. For admit the memory were never so retentive; yea, that it might vye with that of Cyrus , who could call every Souldier in his Army by name; yet to make it a Store-house or Repository of whatsoever we have seene or heard, would argue too much confidence in such a fraile decaying ornament: for of all faculties in man, Memory is the weakest, first waxeth old, and decaies sooner than strength or beauty. Prima sumus obliti, postrema non intelleximus, quia primanon meminimus . An excellent Moral Caveat, and well- deserving our learning in these times. I could instance divers noble Personages even in this Kingdome, who have risen to an extraordinary pitch of Wisedome, Knowledge, and Elegancy of Discourse by this meanes. These in their forraigne interesses, would admit no day without a line . Privately they recorded whatsoever they had seene publickly atchieved. They sifted the dispositions of men; and reduced the benefit hereof, by complying with them, unto themselves. These Notions fit and enable them for State affaires; and in imployments of Embassie. An office of especiall improvement to the State, being discreetly and wisely managed: For the Person so imployed, presents in his owne, the very Face or Image of the Commonweale. For the better discharge whereof, that he may come off faire, and returne his Prince a gratefull account of what he ha's done, it is necessary for him to reteine ever in memory those Speeches of a grave and judicious Statesman, by way of direction in his moderation of Speech. "He that knoweth how to speake well, knoweth also where he must hold his peace. Wisely concluding: Thinke an houre before you speake, and a day before you promise. Many, and peculiar be those prerogatives granted him; which, as they are exercised by him to the honour of the State from whence he came, so is he to neglect no opportunity for dispatch of those affaires for which he came. To reteine a seemely-modest State without affectation, will infinitely become him, for that suits worst with his person of all others. He is priviledg'd from suffering abuse or dishonour; in the same line of relation is he to beare himselfe towards another. For in this is the Law of Nations exhibited, that he neither harme, nor receive harme from others. Albeit, hee may still enjoy the benefit of this priviledge, till such time as hee recede from his place or Office; that hee may use in his owne family the Sword of Justice to any such as shall utter words of disgrace against the Prince, or shall defile any mans Wife: neither is the Legat himselfe exempted from like punishment, being found in any of these a personall delinquent. For howsoever that Maxime of State be, That none is to handle the Sword, but he who holds the Sceptre; yet a Deputative power hath beene ever granted, which rather improves than detracts from his Majesty by whom it is granted. Now, to insist a little more upon their Dignity; they are neither properly sent by Subjects, nor to Subjects. Their Commission is from the Prince or State directed, not by any lower Power addressed: where, though the Common-weale seeme absent, yet is the Common-weales cause argued in presence. And that a more absolute power or Soveraignty may appeare in him by whom these Agents are sent, than in the persons herein interessed and sent, to speake in one word what duely and properly concernes them; They are upon Returne home, to render an accompt of their whole passage: wherin should they complaine, that the Prince or State to whom they were sent, had rejected, abused,  72 or any way injured them, by the Iulian Law , such an one was accused to have done contrary to the Law of Armes. These, by helpe of History , finde likewise what resolution is required in one so interessed; and in what manner he is to behave himselfe upon affronts done either upon himselfe, or to him whom he doth personate. Amongst many other Instances, he conceives no spirit more appropriate to one in that place, than of that Ambassador of Athens , who answered King Philip of Macedon , threatning that hee would cause his  73 Head to be cut off: "If thou takest this Head from me, my Countrey will give me another that shall be immortall: for my Head, a Statue; for Death, Immortality. Memorable Examples of this kind are every where to be found, in this unvaluable Storehouse or Treasury of Time, History. But in ample tearmes to explaine what the condition of an Historian is, let me in briefe, yet materiall words, expresse what hee meanes:  74 Not such as inveigh against States, or politicke Governments, for such are rather Satyrists, than Historians; nor such as personate the entire acts of a Martialist, by assentative tearmes; which are such as insinuate themselves by a glosing Style to winne the affection of their Patron Lesse to be borne with be these, than the other, subjecting the free use of History to a Parasite and oylie tongue: which moved Alexander so exceedingly against Aristobulus , as that on a time hearing his owne Acts deblazoned farre above truth, he commanded his Labours should be throwne over Boord: saying, He was almost induced to throw Aristobulus after : A caveat very necessary for all clawing Parasites that make their Pen Mercenary , and therefore, as may be inferred upon their workes, dare not unrip the vitiousnesse of times; lest by unbosoming Truth, they should incurre the offence of some person, to whom their labours are ingaged, their fortunes subjected, and their endeavours partially devoted. Plato banished all Poets Athens : but a favourable Glosse would restraine that Ostracisme onely to peculiar wits, (petulant I meane) such as the Prince of Sparta proscribed his well-governed  75 City, for presenting some obscoene Verses to his Queene. But I wonder why Plato excluded not these Historians, since their Labours were prostitute (like the publick Strumpet) for gaine, making their Writings to the opinion and imitation of that Scarabee of History, who being demanded why he wrote not truth of such a Prince; replyed: Vivit, quis vera dicet ? His life kept him in awe, he durst not expresse his vices to the quicke, lest he should bite too much. This that experienc'd, but unfortunate Knight  76 well observed, as may appeare by his owne words: "Whosoever in writing a Moderne History, shall follow Truth too neare the heeles, it may happily strike out his teeth. Wherein I commend the incomparable Theano , who is so cautious in his Historicall Notions of what he writes, as hee will commit nothing to publick, which hath not beene first confirm'd both by strong Intelligence and Subsignation under the hands of the eminent'st persons there residing, where any such action past. Nor is he spare in the relation of what he heares; so it import the Subject whereof hee writes: Though Princes should sollicit him by rewards, hope of higher preferment; he cannot endure to have his Pen sold, nor to comply with the humour or current of Time for any unworthy ayme. It was the excellent saying of an impartiall Historian , who being demanded by One who had reduced his Empire to a meere Tyranny; why he remembred not him in his Writings? "Because (quoth he) I read nothing in you worth remembring. Why doest thou not then (replyed he) record my Vices? Lest others (said he) should erre by your Example, and so imitate them. It is the highest honour of an Historian, to be accounted sincere . As hope of Honour should not transport him, hope of Reward corrupt him, nor ayme to any outward comply divert him from speaking Truth: so should no commanding power over-aw him, to betray his knowledge, or to sow pillows to the Elbowes of Greatnesse. This endangers his credit for ever, and throws a contempt on his Labour. Many there are, who describe things rather as they should be done, than as they were done. This is not to make a discovery of truth, but to propose a forme or Method of what should bee done according to truth. The lives of Princes, and their actions were ever held Modells of imitation for Inferiours. Their very behaviour, were it in some  77 gesture never so uncomely, h'as ever begot Followers in persons of meaner quality. To rectifie these, nothing more powerfull, than to produce more cleare and imitable Examples; that in them, as in living Mirrors, they might discover their owne Errors. It was the saying [illeg.] Antisthenes , that those that would live free from vice, had need either of most unfeigned friends, or of most bitter enemies; because, the one by his admonition, or the other by his reproach might withdraw him from vice. Whence Diogenes being asked, how one should be revenged of his enemy? answered, by being a vertuous and honest man; for his integrity would beget him such a common conceit of extraordinary vertue, as hee who maligned him, would hardly endure to frequent any place, where he feared to heare his Enemies praise. Nasica , when the Roman Common-weale was supposed to be in most secure estate, because freed of their enemies, affirmed, that though the Achaians and Carthaginians were both brought under the yoak of bondage, yet they were in most danger, because none were left whom they might either 78 feare for danger, or who should keepe them in awe. This caused Oenomademus in a Faction in the Isle of Chios to counsell his fellows, that they should not expulse all their Enemies, but still leave some in the City; "Lest (quoth he) being freed of all our Enemies, we should begin to quarell with our friends. Most certaine it is, that very few in all our preceding Ages, unlesse they were such Philosophicall Kings , as Plato wish'd them to bee, could in the height of their fortunes, endure reproofe; especially in such publicke manner, as to be recorded by an Historicall penne. For one Alexander , who could not ensure Aristobulus praising him above truth, wee might produce tenne Alcibiades , who could not abide Eupolus for taxing him according to truth. But to deliver our Opinion freely of discourses in this kind: Actions are so to be laid open, as the Agent may either receive honour, or suffer in them. For if in our private Accompts, wee will be cautious enough, lest any thing be omitted or inserted more than should be: much more in these Accompts or Registers of Time. They then, that interesse themselves in Labours of this nature, are not in their Compilations, to eye any mans  79 person: More incomparably-beautifull is the Truth of Christians , than that imparalel'd Helen of the Grecians . Those that write lesse than the state of their History requires, may be properly called the Moaths of Epitomes , as Epitomes of Histories . Those that write more, make their fictitious Comments , rather Glosses than Glasses of Time: containing in them an Ocean of words, but a drop of Truth. Nor are precious Houres to be so mis-spended, their Oyle so wasted, when every Line should survive the vading period of Life, and reserve to posterity a continuate Storie of their Predecessors Actions. Mans life may be most properly compared to a Lampe: for as a Lampe may be three wayes extinguished; First, by outward violence, as when it is blowne out: Secondly, by pouring in much water, whereby the good liquor of the Oyle is drowned and corrupted: and thirdly, by the wast and spending of the Oyle it selfe: So likewise a Mans life (which in truth resembles much the nature of a Lampe) is extinguished by three wayes and meanes; to second her resemblance both in the appearing and extinguishing; first, by externall force, to wit, of the Sword, fire, strangling, pressing, poysoning, and the like: Secondly, through the aboundance of ill humours, or the malignant quality of them, whereby the Radicall humour is opprest and overthrowne: Thirdly, when the Radicall humour is in long space of Time quite consumed by the Naturall heate, and blowne out into the Ayre; which is done after  80 the same manner, that boyling water or Oyle is wasted by the heate of the fire. Now, as Radicalis humor is in Corpore , so is  81 Veritatis amor in Corde : Which divine vigour, when it is corrupted or impaired by any vitious or malignant humour, it looseth her light. Now, what is this humour which so darkens this divine vigour or truth of an Historian; but partiality? which streames either from the weake and shallow Channels of Pusillanimity ; or the muddy Inlet of base commodity . For the former sort, their Spirits are too weake for such a Taske: for such as will suppresse Truth, or obscure the light of their History, by suffering themselves to be over-awed by Authority, are fitter to be imploy'd in discoursing of the Pigmeis warres, or of the battell of the Frogs and Mice , than any eminent action. For the latter, their dispositions are so unworthy, as they are never to be admitted within the List of an History: for these preferre trash before truth, and so far under-value that usefull imployment whereto they stand ingaged, as they lose themselves by deriving gainefrom that, which should be from all servile fetters freed. Let the first consider, how unfit they are to converse with Princes precedent, which in their readings they daily doe; who are so over-awed by the Count'nance of times present, as overcomewith feare, they silence that which should have bin the activest Scene in all their Subject. This many times makes a lame discourse: when to supply actions of higher consequence, they impe in needlesse trifles: such as neither require an Historians labour, nor recompence the lost time of the Reader. That conceited Treatise c oposed by an Italian , entit'led A Supplication to Candle-light ; discovering the abuses comitted  & curtained by the silent & secret shade of night, deserv'd high approvement in comparison of these. Hee lighted his Lamp purposely to discover vice; these put out their lights, lest they should suffer for their discovery of vice. O! that these would but apply that divine sentence somtimes uttered with no lesse courage than comfort by a devout father:  82 " In such a cause, wherein my desire is to please God, I little feare the power of man . So they in a busines of such consequence as imports the benefit of State, the advancement of truth, are not to be pusillanimous, but discreetly resolute; that neither too much boldnes may deservingly taxe them of indiscretion: nor remisnesse, of too much want of spirit nor irresolution. Let the latter, likewise, privately converse with his owne thoughts: and weigh with himselfe, what a base or sordid gaine it is, to purchase to himselfe honour or preferment by untruths. A Lye is held a word of dishonour, onely spoke by the mouth: what a deepe taint or impression wil it reteine, standing on record? Now to prevent the meanes of publishing Subjects of this kind, for profit sake, as many of our unauthorized Novells have of late times beene published;  83 those fore-running ages allowed ample Pensions for their Authors; such as might in a good measure, without a necessitated beholdingnes to any, maintaine the: lest want of means might corrupt their pen; by making that mercenary, which stood ever priviledg'd, and retein'd in it selfe a native liberty. For should privat rewards soile the purity of an History , what might become free? The Acts of his Benefactor , were they never so obscure or ignoble, should receive a gracefull immerited expression: Meane time, the Actions of whomsoever he maligned, were sure to have their brand, were they never so deservingly approved or eminent. This is no square dealing; and in all times much hated; yea, and highly censured, as may appeare by sundry Ancient-Historicall Records, which for brevity sake I here omit, referring them to the Roman Annals , where they may be stored with variety of Instances in this kind. Now, as Plato in his Dialogue entitled Symposium , by way of Fiction describeth the difference betwixt two kinds of Venus : whereof, the first was more ancient, brought forth by the Heavens , whome vertuous men doe follow: the second much younger, begotten betweene Iupiter and Dione , whom wicked men doe serve: So say I of these, whom wicked men doe serve, or rather serve wicked men, by complying with their humours, either for feare of censure, or ambition hope of honour; let them withdraw, they are not to be enter'd here in Checkroule: while with a free and affectionate embrace, these onely are to be entertained, who scorne to humour time, either for hope of immerited honour, or servile profit. Indeed, I must acknowledge there should be a reverend and modest concealing of such Personages in criminall causes, so the bounds of the History can admit it. And sometimes a Native pusillanimity  84 restraines us to speake that which wee know, because silence (as the wise Sage said) never occasioned so great offence as Speech. And Veritas odium parit , is a Motto for these dayes  85 too probable, too, well authorised; where sinnes goe with impunity, adoring their growth with a faire out-side, to second that Tyrant of Syracuses proposition el quis; cowiges audet prodere, si crimen audiat ? Sure such tyrannizing Subjects, or Objects rather of feare, must needs be terrible to the poore Historian: He cannot shew Iulus Canius spirit, spit in the face of Tyranny: Hating by a modest [illeg.] pamper Vice, though reprehension cost him a gage, hee could redeeme with nothing save life: Such was that Cordus (the Roman Historian) who for speaking truth was censored un worthily  86 But if Princes or Polentates should exactly observe the courses and revolutions of times, the subsequent degrees of ruine and deposition (vices Apologized) they would commend such an Historian (and no lesse deseitfully) who employeth his Time, wasteth his Oyle, and matrates himselfe in the scrutinie of true Relations, by conferring Histories together; and with a Judicious approbation, or electing power, extract whatsoever may seeme most probable and authentick. Many worthy Statists have desired, and in themselves no lessd deserved (though perhaps some little sparke of vaine-glory may seeme to appeare in them) to have their memorable Acts recorded: as Cicero his withstanding Cateline, Cato his Opposing C aesar, Solon his Pisisiratus, and Demosthenes his Philip : their acts recounted, and committed to memory, induce others to the like attempts: and like a coole Arbour to a wearied passenger, yeelds no lesse delight to themselves; which Persius seemes covertly to shadow in his first Satyre: Et pulchrum est digito monstrari & dicier hic est . This finger is History, which truely demonstrates the life of the person, characters his vertues, or vices; disposing every particular member and branch of his discourse in such exact method, that it resembles a faire beautifull building, which yet deserves more commendations for the contrivement, than the outward and garish Garnishment. Æ des opera sunt, quae si culte extruantur, minus restat, siminus samptuose . True; Bookes Historicall have no better beauty (nor indeed can they) than an apt and methodicall disposition: other accomplements are superfluous, resembling some of our workes now and then published, with faire and beautifull Frontispieces, as if some worthy conveyances (rare buildings of Art and Nature) were within so comely portalls. But alas! looke inward, nought but rubbish and refuse of some old building, unhandsomely repaired; or some frothy invention, not worth halfe so much cost: These should feare (as the Philosopher told the  87 Mindians ) lest their whole Labours should flye out at their gate, having their gate so promising, their Labour so immeriting. But such as goe ad pr aelum tanquam ad praelium (for so indeed they doe) furnish themselves aforehand with exactest Labours, to stand in defiance against the spirit of detraction: for we cannot fortifie our workes against all Assailants: some being addicted to carpe, because long custome hath confirmed in them a desire of reprehension. Æ lianus in his Naturall History reports, how the Vipers issue is the bane and death of the Parent: Certainly, as Libri are our Liberi , our children, which wee should be as carefull and provident in bringing up, as the Father over his child: so oftentimes they play the Vipers with us, they murder us in our name and reputation, much disparraging their Parents, being prizelesse, and therefore unfit for presse: nay, they doe more, they oftentimes asperse an imputation upon Her that should be no lesse deare (if not more) unto  88 us, than our selves, our Countrey : making her flowery besome a nourisher of fruitlesse labours, a stale to licentious Libells, or Brothell rather of lascivious measures. And how shall we make answer for so many motives to lust, so divers inforcements to inordinate affections, and so temporizing subjects in humouring great ones, and soothing Vice in her Majesty? Debemur morti nos nostraq : where our workes must abide scanning, and that by a Judicious censurer; one that can unrip the secretest of imagination, and knows the Bent of our purposes. It was an excellent saying of Judicious Casmerus: Parum est legere aut colligere, sed intelligere, & in formam redigere; hoc artis, hoc laboris est . Would Authors make use of this, they would not in so impolish'd nor uncompos'd a forme send forth their Cubbs before they be lick't: nor set their fruitlesse braines a worke in publishing such uselesse Labours, as have no proper Object whereto they may seeme to ayme, but an itching desire of being in Print: to have a Name amongst Authors; albeit, many times that Name redound to their dishonour. These may be compared to those uncleane beasts , who never chew their Cud. It is a Divine Position: " He that goes to meditate, before he be prepared, that man takes in hand to build an house before stones be gath'red . What  89 shall we judge of him, who without study or premeditation sets hand to paper: as if Works of that nature were onely Manuall, and no braine labour? How miserably are their judgments darkned, or rather how pittifully are such deluded, who hope to receive life, or reteine esteeme from such Spider-caules? Wherein our pregnant'st and refinedst Wits are many times most conscious. Wee observe, how some of our Women are so taken with their streight and well- shap't bodies, as they would not for a world have Children, lest they should spoyle their feature: nor will these Mushrome-wits , who are ever teeming, never suffering, betake themselves to any paines, lest that burdenous labour might detract from the beauty of Nature. These hold Study an unnecessary accoutrement for good wits: present and pregnant must be their Fancy, out of some Po eticall rapture or fury: wherein by that individuall spirit of Sacke, they stretch and straine their enforced Genius to such high lines, as if Prometheus -like, they had stolne Fire from Heaven, drunk Hippocrene dry, or broke open the Muses Cabbinet, and soakt those poore Girles of all their influence. Where, some in perusall of these Ebrious Lines, will usually be so farre transported with them, or more properly, besotted by them; as they will vow, nothing could be compos'd by any Wit, were it never so fluent, upon a fasting or abstemious stomack, like those Conceipts. Nay, that no pr aemeditation could mend them: being so enlivened and full of Spirit, as they were farre more easily admired than imitated. This I must confesse, is a great happinesse of Wit; but it confirmes withall that Maxim of the wise Stagyrian; "There was never any great wit without some mixture of folly : which may appeare by their disesteeme of study or pr aemeditation, as if it were a rubbe or Remora to invention. It was Eucherius saying; Nihilest magnum re, quodbrevetempore : But these spritely Wits are of another Opinion. They hold no worke nor composure worth approvement: which, like an unnaturall Birth, appeares not in his full shape upon the instant: And of those, none deserving more admiration than their owne. It was the saying of a famous Orator: " I never knew any Po et (yet was I well acquainted with Aquinius, and many others) who did not thinke his owne doings better than all others . Nor is this speech of his to be onely restrained to such as professe Poetry, but even generally to every distinct study: which he quickly discovered, who concluded: Delyrant plerunq, Scriptores in libris suis. Now, to contract my Sayles in the prosecution of this Argument; I should hold it no lesse convenient than mainely necessary, that such, who addresse themselves to imployments of this sort, doe use a cautious deliberation both in the election of their Subject, as also in their Style and Method  90 of handling it. Lest, what sometimes the Scriviner by way of derision spoke unto an impertinent Author, be applyed unto them. This Scriviner being on a time in company with a Scholler, who profest himselfe to have Writ much; and having heard a large Catalogue of his obscured Labours: the Scriviner seem'd to challenge an affinity to his profession. "No, that were absurd, answered the Scholler; why, replyed the Scriviner? I am a Writer. Yea, but said the Scholler, I am an Author. No, excuse me, quoth the Scriviner, I make no doubt of that; There are more Writers , than Authors ; and the Catalogue of your Labours enroule you in that number. In one word, those Workes onely deserve Approvement, who derive their life and light from Judgment. Such onely merit the Title of Records ; because they live to posterity: and represent to the Successor whatsoever was imitable or despicable in their Ancestor. These are Workes to be ingraven in Cedar , and well-deserving their C aesar . So that, as Alexander had his Homer in Reverence for his Po esie; his Aristotle for speculation and Philosophy; Alcibiades the Instructions of Socrates to ground him in Piety; C aesar the continuall practice of his owne Commentaries to improve his glory; and Affrican the workes of Zenophon to enable him for occasions Domestick or Military: So these memorable Labours, which are thus penned by judicious and industrious Authors, merit no lesse honour, in what State or Province soever they shall receive harbour. For others, as corruption of manners is their Scope, or vaine glory their ayme, or some other by-respect the object of their Pen, they deserve a due censure from the State, for seeking so odiously to poison that brest, which nursed them. Thus much I have writ briefly (by way of inference) to caution such as by their Labours erect a Throne for Impiety to sit in: these Humour-mongers, that can with C aesar the Dictator, Atros dies albos facere , make blacke white, and maske Vice with a vaile better suiting with Vertue: Now will I discend to their Opposite, and that is, the Satyricall Writer, or Historiomastix. Some of these are very dangerous to a State, laying it open too much: and though acts should  91 be related, as they were done: yet, if the circumstances may seeme any way detractive to some person, or state, they are better silenced (if it may stand with the body of the History) than discovered. covered. I have knowne some too precise in this veine: and one especially I remember, who speaking of the great Sultan , could not be content to describe his Palace, managements domesticke and publicke, person, and the like; but of his piked Beard, the colour of his stockings: and in the end comming neere him, (said he) and indeed nearer than need was, his breath was noysome. These, and such like impertinent circumstances are so frivolous, that they imply a defect of Judgment in the Author, to insert such idle, and immateriall Ambages in an History of consequence. But these are farre from those Historiomastixes 92 of our Time; some whereof personate the wrongs of a Noble Ancestor to his lineall Successor, moving him to revenge. This is one of the Furies Brands: for you shall never see one of this kind, but a tergo Nemesis , hee hath vengeance at his backe; a spleenefull disposition disgorged upon the best of deserts. And thus he inserts the injuries: "Such a family (well meriting of Prince and Countrey, and ever found loyall to the State) was undeservedly censured by the malevolent suggestions of such, and such; whose suggestions are (as yet) unrevenged, but the Heavens are just. What Motives more enforcing to civill commotion? Injuries ript up, have oftentimes  93 hazarded States: and there was never any People, Nation, or Government, which have not from time to time had one of these. Thersites , as deformed in minde as body, (for so Homer characters him) was ever kindling the flame of civill combustion betwixt Achylles and Agamemnon at the Siege of Troy , about the rape of Briseis ; ever harping upon that string to set them together by the eares. Why Achylles, should you sustaine so great reproach, that have engaged your selfe for Agamemnon, and his Brothers glory? Be all your hopefull Services, your valiant Exploits, your incomparable Atchievements so rewarded? Hath Agamemnon no place for valour? no regard to honour? Why then desist Achylles, embarke your selfe for Greece, and leave this brave Champion to himselfe and his fortunes; your merits (being gone) will be better esteemed. You had but one prize, (and that prize unworthy too of your valour) and must that prize, got with much sweate, many difficulties, imminent dangers, multitude of occurrents, now be taken from you? But one Briseis, one deare one, and yet Achylles must loose her. Alas poore resolution! Why, it is better to be Ægystus, a Coward, a Resreant, one that retires himselfe from Armes, fighting close under Clytemnestra's Target. Such a Carpet-Knight is better than a Martiall-Knight . Then would hee presently move Agamemnon in like sort, in no case to moderate his desires: Why should Achylles have so faire a Paramour, and the Prince of Greece want one ? Such Agents of mischiefe as these, are ever of a neutrall Faction: they hover like the Patte , uncertaine in adhering to any: they more admire the Sunne when it is rising than setting . They measure the worth or merit of every action by the successe of it. And when the day is closed; the actions of that day finished; they admire nothing more than those Booties which the Conquerour h'as gained. Their Historicall Relation must become a Panegyrick Oration. No compositions too elaborate; no Lines too Elegant, to give life to his conquest. Meane time, though the worser cause fared the best, as it was with unfortunate Pompey : whose memory had, no doubt, many Ages survived C aesars , had his fortune beene paralel with C aesars ; they have the Art to magnifie the equity of the Conquerours side: and with palpable assentation to insinuate into the affection of so commanding a spirit. Many glorious Attributes of greatnesse are these ready to devise, to honour him that h'as wonne the day. But bitter are their Pens in disvaluing the Actions of the conquered: in lying aspersions upon his person; disgracing his Alies: and inventing by all meanes how to advance the Fame of the one, by derogating from the other. This it was (as I formerly observed) that induced Alexander to conceive such great distaste against Aristobulus , as he was almost ready to send both him and his Workes together into the River Hydaspis . For there is no noble nor princely disposition, who can endure to heare his conquered Foe dishonoured: or to see any one lead him in Triumph but himselfe. When C aesar had commanded those demolished Monuments of Pompey (Statues reared in his former affluence of Fortune) to be set up againe, Cicero told him, that in erecting Pompeys Trophies, he established his owne. So praise-worthy is the compassion of a Conqueror, that in this hee deserves more praise, than his victorious prize. Nor is it lesse noble in him to contemne those servile earthy Spirits, who mold their Pens to the inclination of the day: holding him onely worthy honour who got it; and the vanquish'd all dishonour, because his Fortune was more sinister. Whereas the goodnesse or equity of the Cause is not to be measured by the Cloze: Many prest quarrells have produc'd strange effects: yea, such incroaching powers, whose onely ground of Hostility, was inlarging of their owne Dominions, or enriching their coffers by others fortunes, have received wonderfull successe; albeit, some Cloud or other in the end eclyps'd their greatnesse, and return'd them a just and proportionable revenge according to the measure of those injuries, which by invasion, oppression, or usurpation they had done unto others; as the Lyrick sometimes sung: Quicquid a vobis minor extimescet, 94 Maior hoc vobis Dominus minatur. As the Great deales with the low, God will use the Great ones so. But to returne to our Discourse: As those who are interessed in these Military affaires, are to ayme at nothing more than the justnesse of their quarrell; which reteines still in it selfe a quickning power to the most declining spirits: so are those who undertake the recommending of those actions done, with a competible Pen, to relate the grounds and occasions of their comming on; of passages during the warre; with the event or issue thereof; without siding or complying with either part; either for Country, or any other private ingagement. As for those, who ( as Optatus speakes in another sence) are all for Time , nothing for Truth : or, as Themistius sometimes spoke of the Acacians , who by complying with the Emperour, and applying themselves to his pleasure, justly gained the name of  95 Iovinians , ascribe more reverence to the Purple than Person , Their workes may receive breath for a time, but cannot promise any continued same. It was a Speech worthy the Mouth of Traian: Hoc prome utere, si iusta impetr aevero, contra me si injusta . His desire was no longer to reigne than he reigned well. The hearts of his people hee sought not to winne by any soveraignizing way: for he found those paths full of perill. Nor by pretending goodnesse, or shrowding cloudy designes with faire pretences, for those hee shunned, because unsoundly grounded. And as the Fish Sepia is bewrayed by a blacke colour, which she casteth out to cover her: so this dusky vapour of dissembling being once dispersed, would bring him to a discovery, and by degrees to ruine. This had he read in the Tragicall Catastrophe of Tiberius, who gloried in nothing so much as in cunningly cloaking his private purposes with guilded glozes, faire pretences, going invisible, and deluding his Subjects resolutions with a seeming good. Faire semblances poized with their incommodities, prove oftentimes fruitlesse, tedious, or noxious, as the Italian Proverbe implyeth: Chi habianco Cavallo, et bella moglie No vive mai Sansa doglie. This he discovered in others misery, which sufficiently inform'd him to shun such Presidents of impiety. Nor sought this brave Prince to ingratiate himselfe in the affections of his people, by an indiscreete bounty: for the fatall effects of such indisposed Sowers of their Fortunes, he read deepely charactred in the loose and lavish reignes of Vitellius, Commodus, &c . For these, howsoever they might seeme to have free hearts, they had weake and shallow Conceits: in distinguishing the merit of the person to whom they show'd, or rather showr'd downe their bounty. He, who could time it most, was ever sure to be rewarded best: which begot in persons of desert and quality such discontent, to see others of base condition advanc'd, themselves contemn'd: as this their inconsiderate bounty became the onely pulley to hale them to calamity. Nor could this absolute Prince (for hee was Soveraigne over himselfe) indure to force an obedience in his Subjects, by a tyrannick feare: for though Nero's Position was this: Fortuna 96 nostra cuncta permittit mihi : Hee held that Maxim farre more princely: Quo quisque potentior, patienti us mala ferat . Either to plant in blood, or beget a more awfull command and Soveraignty by practising in himselfe or Officers, effusion of blood, he found that course no means to secure him, nor to settle him in an Imperiall State. Hee had received from that Learned  97 Morall, how, in the minde or conscience of a Murtherer, there shall alwayes remaine a plague of Blood; his Eyes shall behold no other colour but sanguine , as if the Aire were dyed into it; the Visions of his Head in the Night-time shall cast a Bowle of blood in his face. Howsoever, most certaine it is, that divers factious Incendiaries have showne themselves in most Pavillions; where, by private suggestions they ever sought to sow differences amongst Eminent'st persons: purposely by a parasiticall way, to creepe into favour with one or other. Which ever redounded to the Authors dishonour; as might be instanc'd in sundry Examples both Ancient and Moderne. For whence came those fatall-fraternall discords betwixt Polynices and Eteocles ? Those continued Warres betwixt the Romans and Carthaginians; Sabines and Samnites ; but from these Spirits in the Vault , who were impatient of nothing more than peace: nor Fautors of ought more than Division? In troubled waters is their best fishing: Halcyon dayes are their Canicular-dayes . A calamitous Cann ae , or fatall Pharsalie , Camps where they hang their Trophies of glory. In which, they hold it impossible but to finde some, on whom they may practise. Hecuba's Dreame of bringing forth a Burning Torch , may be in these verified: Their stirrings would bring all to cinders, were they not seasonably quenched. Publick safety, private Amity, all correspondence meeting mutually, would by these bee soone dissolved, were they left alone to act their owne parts: which would in short time burst out into such combustion, as the Stage where they acted, should present nothing but Enmity and Division. Some of this Stampe, our late Gracious Soveraigne of famous Memory, King humane Learning deservingly approved, yet for their indiscreet passages in this kind, (as may appeare more fully in their Historicall Relations) they utterly lost his esteeme. These are poysonous and virulent heads, that suggest into the eares of Princes, Arguments of revenge, causes of distrust, motives of suspicion  98 and jealousie: not to profit themselves, but to satisfie the depravednesse of their owne natures, intended to nothing but the subversion  99 of States, the setting at discord united Princes: En pallor! &c .---It was thought, that 100 in that glorious and Christian-like expedition of those memorable Hero es , Princes recorded in the eternall booke of fame, against the Turkes , whose hostility had laine waste those blessed and fruitfull coasts, where the remnant of Israel was once planted: that the greatest cause of the ill successe of that Warre proceeded from some factious heads, setting (that unfortunate, yet never sufficiently praised Heroe ) the Duke of Normandy , and the King of France , at variance: an impious and disasterous enmity, being a maine impediment for the hindering a warre, no lesse glorious to Heaven, than generally beneficiall to all the world. Some have imputed the cause to certaine expostulations betwixt the two Princes, which grew afterwards to words of publick reproach and infamy; upbraiding each other with divers insolencies offered by their Countries, one to another. What ere the Motive of this dissention  101 was, (how varied soever the opinions of Writers be herein) the braine that contrived it, was sure the forge of great impiety, and an irreparable detriment to the Christians, exposing them to ruine, slaughter, and desolation. The like we may read of those two renowned  102 Cities, Sparta and Athens : which two flourishing Common-weales long time lived in unity, without the least motion of warre: but in fine , reading the workes of a mutinous Historian: mutinous indeed; for his factions before, had beene sufficient without further inducements by writing: such bloody and cruell warres ensued, as the fire of those intestine combustions was not extinguished with lesse than an universall effusion of blood. Many more I could produce, even neare at home, but I must not insist upon one Argument too long, since I have entred a spacious and intricate Maze, that promiseth entrance enough, if I can (with Ariadnes threed) finde a passage to my precipitate adventure. \------------------------------ Thus much have I spoken of State-snarling Historians, that make their Workes like pricks or goads to the publick State, I will now proceed with my former division of History, and finde in these two extreames ( Assentation , and State-invection ) a meane to direct us in the perfect and exact use of Historicall Narrations: Medio tutissimus ibis ; neither too depressed, as if 103 thy Labours exprest their Masters poverty: nor too erected, to intimate thy states security. Thou art too depressed, when with lagging wings thou stopest to every base lure, or object of affection, making thy Invention a stale to others pleasure, writing nothing lesse than truth, because truth cannot teach thee how to live. Thou art too erected, when like an eminent Censor, thou taxest the acts of Princes, with such an austere brow, as if thou hadst forgot the discipline of History, and wer't transformed to a profest Satyrist; mixing thy Inke with farre more gall than discretion: yet trasported with imaginary motives of selfe-conceit; cares not who be galled, so thou (with Ctesiphon ) kicke against the Moiles heeles. For the latter, there's no profession more easie, nor subject more frequent, nor Argument more generall: and as Iuvenal saith: 104 Difficile est Satyram non scribere: nam quis iniqu ae Tam patiens urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se? For the first, I never knew any Discourse  105 worth reading, proceed from so base and ignoble Merchants: They sell their Workes by retaile; and hope of a gainefull Dedicatory, makes them contemne Method, Truth, Subject, and all. Irus skrippe is open; relieve but the needy Artist, he will imitate the Bohemian Curre, fawne on a good suite : shew the project of his intendments to him; deague but thy protection, and he will second it with an indeared protestation; to insert Monumentall Characters of Honour to grace thee; onely bestow thy bounty, and shew not thy selfe unworthy of so fabulous an Attendant. His Invention is tyed to his Benefactors: then dryes the source of his fancy, when they restraine the Spring of their Bounty. It is the misery indeed, of the Age, not alwaies to fixe upon Merit: seeing many rare and exquisite Witts, and those singularly improved by continuate study, and conference, sleepe many times in silence, unregarded, at least unrewarded: while more sterile Conceipts receive advancement. Yet should not these respects make a Scholler forgetfull of so generous a Title, as the best-discerning Heralds of Antiquity have bestowed on him. For if wee will credit Authority, or the testimony of such, whose precious-spent Oyle hath deservingly purchas'd them a memorable esteeme, we shall finde the Style of a Scholler deepely stamped with the Print of honour. Whence it is, that Citr aeus writeth,  106 that in Prage , an University of Bohemia , where Iohn Hus and Hierom of Prage professed, that they that have continued Professors for the space of Twenty yeeres together, by a constant residence, are created Earles and Dukes both together. And therefore to dignifie their persons the more, their Style is to be called Illustres ; whereas they which are singly and simply but onely either Earles or Dukes, are called Spectabiles . Neither maketh it any matter, that they have no revenues to maintaine Earledomes or Dukedomes: for they have the Title notwithstanding; even as Suffragans have of Bishops. Reflect on these, yee free-bred Children of the  107 Muses , and you will scorne to expose your deserving Labours to the Mercenary Trade of our impertinent Pamphletters: who write before they read ; and discover their follies to the world, not to gaine praise but price. Observe but what surviving Fame the laborious Workes of knowing Authors have formerly acquired: Quorum effigies fiver e scire cupias, non saxa sed scripta legas . Admit, they received not that acceptance, while they lived, which their 108 elaborate composures deserved: yet though a Mec aenas sleepe, the whole Judgment of an Age cannot. There will be ever some, who can both read and iudge . So precious are these Monuments of Learning, and have beene ever, that should Fortune play still her blind part, and reserve the smallest portion for Minerva's Followers: They shall live more honour'd in the eye of judgment, because had in disgrace by a painted parcell of foot-cloath State, which never yet aspired to a discerning knowledge of Merit. 109 For tell me, yee happy despicable ones, are you any thing the worse, because despised, where onely Fashion, Complement, or affected ignorance is in request? No; as it is the good mans glory to be disvalued by the evill: so it is your happinesse to receive a disesteeme from these, who pride themselves in nothing but silken ignorance. Niobe , in the affluence of her Fortune, could say: " Greater am I than Fortune can subdue . Much more you, who are enriched with farre more precious substance: you have in you what may truely fortifie you: No matter; though your outward house decline, so your inward house reteine her beauty. Let your Workes then confirme your worth: Let them not palliat an untruth: nor for any hope of an immerited reward, insinuate your selves into the favour of vicious Greatnesse. Make choice of such a Patron , whom you may justly commend: let his Vertues rather than his Fortunes binde you to him. Many have perished in opinion of the world; by addressing their Labours to undeserving Personages:  110 or by writing in way of Commendation, upon unworthy Subjects. Good Wits should be better imployed: and if weake, the Better have writ enough for them to admire. These two sorts (as not worthy an Historicall Title) have I proscribed the bounds of my discourse: if betwixt such two dangerous shelves, I can finde a retired harbour for the truely named Historian to breath himselfe in, I have attained my wished expectance. The meane betwixt these two, gives us observation of noting causes and effects, how produced, and how ended: Counsells and successes, how intended, how administred. Then hee proceeds further, making resemblance betwixt Nature and Nature, State and State, the government of this Province and of that: then differences of Actions and Events: some wisely carried, bearing themselves faire, and promising a compleat satisfaction to the undertaker: yet what opposition betwixt the end and beginning, ruine being the period, or extreme of his hopes? Many such opposite Conversions , or Catastrophes rather, may we dayly see in the managements of Warres. Who more happy in his Countries protection, and who more successive in his prosecution, than Pompey the great in his first entrance to Martiall exploits? Yea, (as C aesar acknowledged himselfe) he had conquered,  111 if he had knowne when he had conquered: yet in event, whose designes more unhappy? Not onely deprived of the bent of his hopes, proscribed (as it were) his native Countrey, and enforced to begge a poore Sepulchre in a forraine Countrey: but even most oppressed by their cruelty, whose service under his owne Banner, had beene rewarded royally. Such discourses often  112 move in men a commiseration, in seeing Vertue so ill guerdoned, and Vice (under a counterfeit garbe) of Innocence, receive an immerited reward. And this certainly have most Historians ever observed in their Writings: so lively to expresse the disasters of deserving men, that their Relations might move a kinde of sensible pitty and remorse in the peruser, which is best exemplified by circumstances: for the time, place, cause, and person, with other necessary Adjuncts, doe (for the most part) lay a more open and smooth Tract to the inforcement of passion. Lucan , that Heroick Historian, brings forth Cornelia sitting upon the shore, where her Husband tooke his last farewell of her: where (like another Niobe ) she makes a Limbeck of her eyes, and descants her owne calamity, oft wishing his returne; and when deprived of his sight, yet the eye of her imagination represents a new object of sorrow. Here, in such royall compositions, and funerall conclusions, he describes the diversity of Nature, in two contrary subjects: a servant faithfull, sitting o're the headlesse trunke of his  113 unhappy Master: a slave as ungratefull, haling his once well-esteemed Lord and Generall to the fatall shoare: where (without raste of remorse, remembrance of former merits, or regard of Countries love) hee deprives him of life. When Marc. Antonie was to present the cruelty committed upon C aesar in that fatall surprize he received in the Capitol: that he might move more compassion in his Hearers; who, as they were for most part Plebe ians , so ocular Presentments usually worke deepest impression with them: shewed in his Funerall Oration the thirty three wounds wherewith C aesar was deprived of life by his Conspirators. Which baring of his body, and discovery of his wounds, with an aggravation of the odiousnesse of the fact, being acted by his owne pretended friends, begot in them an universall sorrow. Nothing but revenge could relish well with them, after this so dolefull a Spectacle. This that excellent Historian, ( Appian. Alexand. )  114 expresseth in such a passionate manner, as his Lines can hardly produce any lesse effect from an attentive Reader. For you shall ever observe, that the Imagination workes more to life than the Line: So as, when such a Discourse is laid open to us, we begin to recollect the Circumstances: as the place where such a Tragicke Sceane was acted; the persons interessed; the quality of the person suffering: all which are so enlivened by the imagination, as it makes the Reader a Spectator . so strong and sinewy is the conceipt of him who understands what he reads. Choranius , who had beene Pr aetor , being condemned and now attached by the Souldiers, during those Factions of the Trium viri , intreated them to forbeare from offering violence, till he might send his sonne to speake with Antonie ; imagining, good Old man, that his sonne out of a naturall affection and reverence to his gray haires, would interceed for him, but they laughed at his suite, answering him, that his sonne had  115 spoken, but it was to the contrary: When the old man heard this, he desired them to tarry till hee had seene his Daughter; whom when he saw, he commanded " shee should abstaine from his goods, lest her Brother should sue for her Death unto Antonie. But observe the fatall issue of Disobedience! This unnaturall Sonne, having consumed prodigally all his goods, the unhappy remainder of his Fathers fortunes, became afterwards attached of Felony, and saved himselfe by flight: where living in a tedious Exile, hee closed his dayes as miserably, as his former course was unnaturall. A plenteous Store-house of Examples for all conditions is History in it selfe. Which conduce much to the regulating of our life; and preparing our selves for death. For if wee shall but consider the resolution of such, who for popular honour, Countries esteeme, or safety of State, have with all readinesse encountred Death: yea, who rather than they would endure to see any Tyrannick Soveraignty introduced; or the ancient Lawes and Customes of their Nation disannulled, would suffer the worst of all extreames: much more we, who fight for a better Countrey: and whose hopes extend the period of time, in the pursuite of our Victory. There is an Epigramme of Callimachus upon Cleombrotus the Ambrocian , whom he sayes (to expresse the force of humane reading) after that he had perused Plato's booke of the Immortality 116 of the Soule , forthwith, without any other apparant cause, cast himselfe headlong downe from a Wall. What effects Historicall Readings have begot, all Times can beare sufficient Record: where some, whose remisse spirits durst never enter lists with any common danger, by being frequently vers'd in Relations of this kinde, became valiant Commanders. Others, in the Survey of Acts done in defence of Ladies honours, as if those Historicall Narrations solely aymed at them, betooke them to the same Enterprize. No Taske too difficult, no designe so impaled with danger, which with a cheerefull smile they would not encounter; so they might vindicate any wronged Ladies honour. Others, hearing those ancient distractions betwixt their owne native Soile, with some other Nation: and the injuries their Countrey suffered; have revived those wounds already cicatris'd, and vowed a revenge for indignities nearely worne out by time. Such lively Presentments are Histories, as they have power to beget spirit in the pusillanimous, constancy in the couragious, modesty in the magnanimous, with a sweete attemperature of all vertues (whereof Clemency is the prime flower) in the Victorious. Such as defiled their native purity with impiety, by giving themselves over unto pleasure; and had stayned the Nobility and splendour of their Soules through wallowing in Vice, or otherwise fraudulently by usurpation or base insinuation, had crept into Soveraignty, or unjustly governing the Common- wealth; such thought Socrates , that they went a by-path separated from the councell of the Gods: But such as, while they lived in their bodies, imitated the life  117 of the Gods, such he thought had an easie returne to the place from whence they first came. Of which Subject Egesias the Cyrenian resolved so amply, and discoursed so powerfully, that he was forbidden of King Ptolomeus to teach the same in Schooles, for that many after his Doctrine willingly killed themselves. These Disputations in those times free from the shock of warre, and inconveniences ever attending Hostility, were usually professed and practised. But when the Gowne and Lawrel gave way to the Launce , such arguments ceased: Philosophy became out of request: Martiall Discipline the sole determiner of causes. Fields became Theaters, where such Sceanes of sorrow were Acted; as the Conquerour could not say that those booties were cleare gaynes which hee had purchased. This moved that princely compassionate C aesar , sometimes to compare his own Imperiall gaine with a Democraticall losse. To comfort that disconsolate Cornelia , whose eies  118 were ever flowing in the remembrance of her injuried Lord. To recall to minde those many eminent Statists, whose glory it was to imbrace Death willingly, rather than become Subjects of his Victory. To recount (if Figures could finde place for such a number) those many beds made Widows; those many Infant- orphans by his Pharsalia . Hee findes the Senate dissolved; all those Orders and Officialls conducing to a Politicall State (while popular command bore sway) rooted. The tongue of Eloquence he findes charmed: and to his innovated State solely chained. He findes Ianus Temple open, and hee is conscious to himselfe, why it was opened: and now he shuts it, but not whithaut a sigh, for he knows not how soone it may be opened. Hee viewes with a serious Ceremony the Statues of his once living, but now interred friends: and in a more passionate recollection of his owne affaires, hee considers, how his ambition brought many of them to ruine. Hee looks when those livelesse Shrines of his loving Allies should tender him a re-greet, at least an inforced smile, as a congratulating testimony of his Victory. But he findes them Emblemes of himselfe; meere shadows of empty greatnesse; a place they hold, and that is all. Having now taken a full view of his Princely Pr aetorian, his fatall Capitoll, and all those memorable Beauties which either Art or State could bring to their full height; hee 119 takes measure of himselfe: and hee findes his heart as unconfined as it was before. Triangular it is, which, should it possesse the world, can no more by the Circumference of the world be confined, than a Triangle by a Circle is to be filled. He eyes his owne Composition; and hee neither findes his body more strengthened, nor the line of his life probably lengthned; nor the stayes of his Empire better setled. And now he feeles in his owne breast, what hee never felt before; numerous cares, nocturnall feares: So as, should he be so secured from all outward foes, as nothing could occasionally troubled him without; he findes such a Battalion within, as he ingenuously acknowledgeth Liberty to be farre more precious than Soveraignty; all which hee findes the experimentall fruits of his Victory. And now he would converse a little with Mortality, which that it may take more impressive Prints upon the face of Majesty, hee goes to the Monument of his vanquish'd Foe; One sometimes equall to himselfe for greatnesse; and transcendent (if the generall Vote and Voice of Rome deserve credit) to him in goodnesse. And what findes he ingraven on that mouldred shrine, but the Effigies of an headlesse Trunke, distinguished by this impresse: " Hic situs est Magnus ! Every where hee findes Fortune his professed foe: and the want of knowledge how to manage a Victory, the occasion of his owne fall. Hee sees the dislaughter'd Corps both of his Friends and Foes equally bleeding: for his Triumph, he conceives it short in measure of those numerous wounds by him occasioned; those profuse Rivolets of blood his hand h'as effused; those Oceans of distreaming teares his Conquests have procured. Such Tragick occurrents require their Emphasis , and a kind of un-usuall working passion: that the History may present to our eyes, the very acts how they were done; making her Discourse (as it is) a Theater of humane Actions. I know  120 pittifull stories have strange effects, if amply described: For Warriers themselves in the report of their owne misfortunes (of all men most pittilesse) have hardly contained themselves from teares. Æ neas wept to see the ruines of his Countrey so lively depictured in Dido's Hall: But when he beheld his poore Father Anchises hanging on his owne shoulders, (having no other refuge in so imminent disasters) Suspiria mittit , he could weepe no longer: for teares mitigate griefe; but with a passionate silencing of his miseries, treasured his un-utterable woes in the balefull Centre of his heart. Xerxes , when of a populous Army, as ever passed out of Asia , hee had but so many left as might attend him in a poore Cock-boat, to accompany him in his distressed expedition, the History mentions, that hee wept bitterly; enstiling himselfe, The ruine of his Countrey, the slaughter of many resolute Souldiers . Nay, Titus himselfe, the Flower of all the Roman Emperours, in the sacke and subversion of that once glorious City Ierusalem , is said to weepe exceedingly, beholding so many lamentable Objects of pitty (dead carkasses lying in open ditches) so as not able to containe himselfe, he cryed out, I call Heaven to witnesse, I am not the cause of this peoples slaughter . Many such representments wee have very usuall in Histories, motive for their passion, and memorable for their end; proceeding from the just Judgment of God, to caution others by their miserable falls. There is another propriety in a History, which  121 should be observed: and that is a Judicious collation, or comparing of Histories one with another. The defect and want hereof, is the principall cause why so maine discordancies & meere oppositions in Histories arise: and that not in circumstances alone, but in materiall points, as originall foundations of Cities, succession of Princes miscited, the sites of Countries (an observance more Geographicall) ill-disposed; with many other errors, which are grounded upon no other reason, than the want of conferring such Histories together, as tend to the present Subject wee have in hand. Nay, were it not much thinke you, now to prove directly, that the very Computation  122 of yeeres which they derived from their ancient Kalendar; and which they observed as Ceremonially and Religiously (in their kind) as wee the yeeres from Christs Incarnation, was very defective among themselves? Yea, to shew you, how Chronologers differ concerning those yeeres from the Worlds Creation, to Christs Birth: some affirming, there be 3929, as Beroaldus : some 3952, as Hierome and Bede : some 3960, as Luther and Iohannes Lucidus : some 3963, as Melancthon in his Chronicle, and Functius : some 3970, as Bullinger and Tremellius : some towards 4000, as Buntingus. Sundry probable opinions every one of these alledged; yet in Computation constantly different. No doubt, but Transcriptions these men had to confirme their Opinions: how then came these to be so defective, or different one from another? Divers have no lesse diversly laboured to resolve this Objection; then they have with impertinency of Reasons intangled the understanding with new doubts. Much was proposed by them Argumentatively, nothing Positively concluded; being by Opponents no lesse probable in their Arguments, than confident of their Judgments, opposed. Howbeit, touching this our Computation, wee rest sufficiently grounded. This onely is the occasion of our inference in this particular: purposely to deliver unto you the diversity, and consequently the maine deficiency of such Transcripts, as former times have recommended to Posterity. Neither need wee wonder that in our owne Kingdome, those who have for many yeeres preceeded us, should afford no great light or direction to their Successours; seeing, Saint Hierome 123 in the end of his Dialogue against the Pelagians , (a booke of excellent Learning and divine Discourse) writeth thus: "The Province of Brittaine , which hath beene oftentimes governed (note the deplorable estate of this Iland in those daies) by Tyrants and other Hostile people; Nations bounding or bordering upon the Ocean Sea, were utterly ignorant of Moses and the Prophets: So that then, by the testimony of Saint Hierome , all our Religion was Heathenish superstition: all our Church-service was Idolatry: all our Priests were Panims : all our Gods were Idols. And to appropriate to every Nation their peculiar God, there was then in Scotland , the Temple of Mars : in Cornwall , the Temple of Mercury : in Bangor in Wales , the Temple of Minerva : in  124 Malden in Essex , the Temple of  125 Victoria : in Bath , the Temple of Apollo : in Leicester , the Temple of Ianus : in York , where St. Peters is now, the Temple of  126 Bellona : in London , where Pauls is now, (and now to more than her pristine beauty restored) the Temple of  127 Diana : Therefore it is very likely, by comparing those Times with preceeding Antiquity, that they esteemed as highly then of the Goddesse Diana in London , as they did in Ephesus : and that as they cryed there, Great is Diana of the Ephesians; so they cryed here, being deluded with the same spirit, and transported with the same pursuit of profit, Great is Diana of the Londoners. Nay, even no more than 53 yeeres before the Incarnation of Christ , when Iulius C aesar came out of France into England , so absurd, senselesse, and stupid were the people of this Land, that instead of the true and ever-living Lord, they served those Heathenish and abhominable Idols, Mars, Mercury, Minerva, Victoria, Apollo, Ianus, Bellona, Diana , and such like. No great marvell then, that people so wholly illiterate and ignorant in the Law of Moses , should be unknowne to the Computation of yeeres descending from Moses . But for the Pagans themselves to be ignorant in their Annuall Accompts with such superstitious solemnity observed; with such constant Feasts solemnized: and every yeere, in their personall visits (especially for their Olympick and Isthmian Games) memorized: it may seeme strange to affirme, but a taske of more difficulty to confirme. And yet this is easily done; for their opinions about their Olympiads in Greece , for the time of their Erection are divers: The foundation of  128 Rome as uncertaine, since the Founder himselfe is not as yet generally agreed of; for the divers Relations of Numitor and Amulius, Romulus and Remus , with their Mother Rhea , or Ilia , (as some will have it) make up a Labyrinth of themselves without further confusion. But to inferre the strange conveyance (or Apotheosis ) of Romulus , suddenly vanished forth of their sight, and by the testimony of Iulius Proculus , transplanted to some other place of more eminence; hardly deserves the credit of an Historian: Yet some there be which shew more favour to this famous Founder of Rome , daigning to bestow a Monument of him, which is erected for him in the Temple Quirinus . Indeed it were little enough to memorize so renowned an Establisher with a Tombe, and to consecrate the place of his Buriall; as Achylles Tombe, or Monument in Sygeum, Theseus in Athens, Ajax in the Rhetian shore, and Alcides Reliques in O eta : Read but over the Roman Annals, and you shall finde the discordancies of Historians in these Computations of times to be great: As especially the destruction of Troy , confounding the severall times of Troyes sacking, missing their Accompt from Laomedon to the succession of Priam . But I have touched the errour enough, let us now descend to the prevention of it. 129 Before we take in hand any Discourse, wee must alwayes meditate of the meanes, ere we can attaine the end: Which end is soonest atchieved, when we addresse our selves for such Subjects (as have beene in our time) wherein we may receive Instruction, by some that have beene inter-rested in those Affaires, of farre more certainty than any Transcription. But intending our Studies to any Forraine Relation (whereof it may be wee have some one Record) I would not depend upon the Antiquity of the Record (for wee have many ancient Fables) but recollect my selfe and examine the probability, whether such particulars are like to beare resemblance of truth or no. And herein wee imitate the Ancientest and best Authorized Historians that ever wrote. Valerius Maximus had recourse, not onely to Roman Annals, (which were kept with great care) but hee used to conferre with such as had any Breviats of the Romane Lives in their hands: Comparing them together, that hee might cull and chuse out from the best Authors (as himselfe witnesseth) such documents, as not onely propagated the glory and pristine height of his Countrey, but might move succeeding ages to emulate their Uertues. The like of that true Moral Historian Plutarch , whose Style so modestly garnished, and so sententiously concluding, hath (and not without cause) purchased him the name of the Father of Histories. La ertius , a worthy recorder of those famous Sages of Greece ; describes his Countries happinesse with great modesty: Whose Sentences may beseeme the gravest Understanding to extract, and upon occasion to accommodate to his owne purpose. Here he shewes Spirit in a Phylosophers  130 Pen, one opposing himselfe agaynst a Tyrant; There a Moralist, making young men fit Sociates for the maturest times: Here a Cynicke, contemning the glory of the World, though offered him; There a merry Greeke , laughing at the Vanities of men wholly besotted and subjected to mundane slavery. O what Christian-like Maxims, what Divine conclusions, what solid Arguments, what enforcing reasons be there included, onely to move men to the embrace of vertue? With Discourse plentifull enough in oppositions betwixt Ethnicke and Ethnicke ; outstripping Nature (if it were possible) in reasoning, and drawing an argument, neere to Divine probation, and ready to confirme it, if the generall blindnes of the Time, and their want of further Revelation would admit of their assertion. Thus much for the former branch of my Division, of Histories True and Authenticke: Now I will entreate of Relations Feigned; yet such as Moralized include an excellent meaning, drained from the uncorrupted Springs of Helicon. \------------------------------ 131 Narrations there be which comprehend in them a wonderfull sharpnesse of judgement, pregnancy of Invention, and a great measure of Discretion; of which sort, none more excellent then the Workes of Homer , weaving many pretty conceites in the web of his  132 History, to make the Subject itselfe more pleasant. The more I commend him to the reading of the judiciously Generous, because I could never find in his Works any scurrulous Affectation, but prosecuting his Discourse with a modest gravity, as if Nature, that had deprived him of his corporall sight, had done it, to make the eie of his understanding more piercing. For who so reads the Majesty of his Stile, the wel-coucht Fables immixt in his War betwixt the Greeks & Trojans , may as in a Store-house, imagine the Treasures of all Wits to be locked up in him. Many excellent Histories have beene derived from him, as well in Prose as contracted Measures; for his pleasing variety relisheth more then others, because through all his Workes, hee useth lesse digression then others: and pitty it is, that every impolish'd hand should have to doe with the Transcription of his Labours: grieving the poore Blind-man with their blindnesse: For who so blind as Bajard? And if Stesycorus was worthily strucke blind for Commenting on Venus beauty, and discommending Hellens forme: Much more deserve they an exacter punishment, that dare with an unprepared sleightnesse, Comment on his eterniz'd Labours,  133 who detected Venus lust, and portraied Hellens Inconstancy. To prescribe in what Tongue Histories are to be read, I know their owne garment is most native. But such have bin the disparraging Labours of our English Translators, that Romes Tongue, and Greeces Characters, grow as vulgar and common with us, as the Italian Garbe: so as wee seeme beholding to others, both for Speech and Raiment. I doe know some Workes are necessary to be Translated being such as expresse the  134 politicke states of Realmes; which imparted to the illiterate, oftentimes conferre no little benefit to our Countrey. But other Works there be, which Modesty would have concealed, being Records of the Vitiousnesse of former times; as the Obscene and sensuall convents, or prostitutions rather, of those mirrors of Impiety, the Roman Emperours; the Relation whereof acquaints the depraved too well with such Impudence. To admit of such Workes, or to give Patronage to such, not only fruitlesse but dishonest Labours, hath beene in all times a great occasion of 135 corrupting youth, nourishing Vice, and introducing a sensuall liberty amongst such, who in regard of their eminence of place, should have bin Patrons and patternes of piety. For if anciently all occasions of loosenesse were so much prevented, as even outward Habits or other externall gestures made them censured: How much more should Authors , whose oyle should be so imployed, as a benefit to some, a prejudice to none ought to be occasioned; labour to compose such Works , or faithfully Translate such Labours , as may conferre a succeeding profit to the State, to which they stand more particularly interessed. Lascivious lines produce vicious lives: seeing men for most part, are more Apishly addicted to the imitation of any vice, then seriously affected to the attention of Vertue. Scandall is a dangerous shelfe: neyther is there any Tetter more noxiously spreading o're the face, then foments and occasionall motives of inordinate lightnesse is to our life. Lacides , that Argive King, was accounted lascivious only for his sleek lookes, and mincing  136 gate. So Pompey , a profest Champion of valour and honour, because he used to scratch his head with one finger; albeit very continent and modest. So Crassus , onely because hee would have bought a Farme of a Vestall Virgin , for which intent only, he used to converse with her, was suspected to have abused her. Posthumia , because out of a naturall inclination, given to laughter, and something forward to talke with men, was suspected of her honesty; whereof being openly accused, she was acquitted by Spurius Minutius with this Caveat, to use words suteable to her life. Now, if Habit, Gesture, or Discourse begot such a suspition amongst Pagans ; what should publicke Workes, whereto Authority gives improvement, do amongst Christians ?. In our readings, as wee should be Bees and no Spiders : brouzing and sucking the fragrant'st and wholesom'st hearbs, and no lesse seasonably converting them to the best substance: So should those, who intend to publish ought; no lesse sincerely then seriously ponder thus with themselves!, before they impart themselves to the World: "whereto tends this passage? will not the ambiguity of it probably beget a mis-construction, and consequently some occasion of corruption? Have our lines their full weight? do they beare that proportion, which may sort with the quality of that Subject whereof they treate? do they neither fall short of the Time, by contracting or injuriously concealing, what should be discovered: Or above the time, by dilating too amply, and annexing a Comment, where the Text it selfe would have served? Is there nought that may offend a modest care, or deprave an unsetled thought? May the State receive it, and be not prejudic'd by it: Or the most censorious Criticke peruse it, and without just ground disrellish it? Princely Augustus , who ever retayned in him a Morall piety, aswell as an Imperiall Majesty; for lesser had the latter beseem'd him, had not the former accompanied him; would not permit his Livia to read light works: no question, light labours make many of our Livia's light. For as the Lover is ever blinded with affection towards  137 his beloved: so it fareth with these, who affected to light passages, in the end so fixe their deluded conceites upon them, as they admire nothing with more constancy, then such Subjects as wrought those love-sicke passions on their besotted fancy. But to recede to our Discourse of Histories of  138 this nature; I find many unprofitable passages in the Translation of our Histories ; which the discretion of a temperate and well-composed Interpreter might have well omitted: neither should he in this have prejudic'd his Author, but acquir'd more honour to himselfe by his Labour. I could instance many passages in sundry Roman Historians , which might discreetly have beene omitted without any defect or maime at all to their History : and by omitting those lighter digressions, ministred lesse offence to a modest Reader. Truth is, we are apt enough to become deprav'd by our owne illimited affections; and little need to have a plat-forme drawne to us, to beget in us a new brood of vicious inventions. Many particulars, no doubt, might suit well the History in his Originall, in respect of the time, place, and persons, wherein and to whom it was addressed: which, attired in another Dialect, and published in these our latter times, would not relish so well to a cleare Judgement. That conspicuous Light of the Easterne  139 Church, whose Devotion and Learning have contracted themselves in so unanimous a manner, as no succeeding Age but shall reape benefit by the perusall of his holy Labours; saith, that anciently the Romans worshiped Vertue and Honour for Gods. Whence it was, that they built two Temples, which were so seated, as none could enter the Temple of HONOVR , unlesse he first passed through the Temple of VERTVE : to signifie, that none was to be honoured, unlesse by some Vertue he had first deserved it. The Morall admits no other ingenuous Exposition, than its owne genuine expression: For Honour , none should be so daring-bold, or presumptuously confident upon a credulous conceit of their owne worth, as to wooe her, much lesse to winne her, till by passing through Vertues Temple, he get free admittance unto her. Now tell me, what Honour shall accrue to those goodly Labours, beautified with glorious Frontispieces, garnished with all the Ornaments and Embellishments of Art, countenanc'd by a powerfull Patron, and accommodated with all those Helps which the extensive Labours of an Author can require: when it shall appeare to the World, that those Lines of his never received approvement from the Temple of Vertue ? Oh, how many sickly Judgments have I knowne of this sort, who by neglecting their choice of Arguments tending to the advancement of goodnesse, and bestowing their Oyle on such as least deserved their imployment, have perished in the esteeme of honest Wits, and disparraged  140 themselves most, where they expected to have beene honour'd most! But as this may be properly construed an errour of life; where the affection of an Author, either in respect of the generall inordinacy of the Time, chuseth rather to fit his Pen to the corruption of the Age, by delivering to her what she most affects: or out of a weaknesse and deficiency of Judgment, preferres a light or lascivious Subiect, solely apt to deprave many, improve none; before such as are serious, and might tend to the benefit of the Publique, being methodically disposed, and faithfully rendred, as Transcripts of that nature, are to be published. So there is another errour commonly arising from ignorance of the Language, wherein such a Subject was writ. As the Greeke , so is the Latine copious and fluent: in both which it is very easie to offend, either by too childish rendring, or erroneous mistaking of the Originall expression. But the Latine Tongue being of most use, because of generall'st Notion through the World; as also for that most of the Greeke Histories were rendred by faithfull Interpretors in that Tongue, received most acceptance: and that not onely in the Latian confines, but in more remote places where other Tongues were in request. We read in Dion Cassius , of a principall man in Greece , that by Claudius was put from the order of Judges, for being ignorant of the Latin Tongue. That in all the regions of Pannonia it was known: Velleius will afford you sufficient authority.  141 Secondly, that it was spoken in a free and native Idiome, in France and Spaine. 142 Thirdly, in Affricke. And (to reflect upon more Divine authorities) it seemeth that the Sermons of Cyprian and Augustine yet extant (of Augustine it is manifest) that they preached to the people in Latin. But in the East parts of the Empire, as in Greece and Asia , and so likewise in Affricke , from the greater Syrtis East-ward, it appears not in our reading nor collection from others, that the Roman Tongue ever grew into any common use. And the reason of it seemes to be, for that in those parts of the Empire it became most frequent, where the most and greatest Colonies were planted. Now, what absurdities are and have bin usually committed upon ignorance of the Tongue, which they laboured to Translate, I leave to the judicious censures of such, who are frequently vers'd in such Subjects: where they shall finde whole pages mis-construed, whole periods omitted, whereby the Author becomes miserably mangled. Now, to returne a true levell unto both; as the Originall exprest acts done in that time vnto life; and, perchance, glanced at some egregious abuses of that Time, or rather displayed them in their deepest colours: So is his Translator in an apt and proper phrase to render him: and if any impertinent, or (which is worse) vicious passages occurre, with a modest silence to passe over them; rather then by an unnecessary inserting of them, informe the present age in knowledge of them. In observing this, their Labours shal deserve to be inchained in our eminent'st Libraries, and retaine in them a confirmed fame, while lighter subjects , which receive their beauty from the complies of Time, or adorne themselves with the quicke-vading flourishes of vanity, shall incline to the period of an easie Fate. But because I have entred into a Catalogue of Po eticall Histories, I will proceed further into the memorable, and no lesse ingenious Works of Hesiod : Much I cannot Write of Hystoricall matter in Hesiod ; yet what he writ of that Subject, comprehended in it more height and true proportion, then any Po et that ever writ. With what hazarding danger doth hee there delineate the rare Combat between Ceix and Cycnus ? Now equally poizing their valours (as if nature had made them of that equall power) to the end to leave the conflict uncertaine. Presently (upon occasioned advantage) hee shewes a better and a worse: yet so, as without the least imputation, or disparrage to either of their spirits (making them as imparalell as equall) but applies the event to some auspitious Genius, or Divine Power, favouring one more then another. Straight, with a new passage, he proceeds to the resolved exploits of Hercules ;  143 and with an admirable facility describes his Labours. Hee it was, that by the assisting hand of Iupiter , of whom he descended, slew the Cleonian Lyon, the Erimanthian Boare, the Bull of Marathon , the Lern aean Hydra , and the winged Hart: Hee who purchased no lesse memorable Trophies in Hell, than on Earth; haling the three-necked Cerberus , and rescuing Proserpina (if the Supreme Powers had not inhibited) from the tyrannick hands of infernall Pluto : Discomfiting the Centaures , vanquishing Achelous (being his corrivall in the love of faire Deianira ) the Stymphalides , the Cremona Gyants, the trayterous Nessus, Ant aeus, Augeas Stables; Apples of Hesperides, Cacus, Busyris , hurling Diomedes to his Horses (to quit his owne tyranny) freeing Hesyone from the Whale, sacking Troy in revenge of the persidious Laomedon , subduing those invincible Giants, Dericlus and Albion , redeeming Orcalia , and Betricia from the captivity of Gerion : and wearing the Amazon Baldrick, to intimate his victories in those warlicke Provinces. These, and the like, doth Hesiod set downe with that probable coherence, that if the matter it selfe did not imply an impossibility, one would be certainly induced to beleeve so concordant an History. Presently he descends to the Generation of the Gods , making up a Genealogy in that distinct order, as the Pagan Gods (for so one hath observed) were much indebted to him for so well deserving their pedigree, which without his invention (perhaps) had laine obscure. Now, howsoever these Inventions may seeme  144 improper for the state or structure of an History ; because it behoves an Historian to relate with probability whatsoever hath hapned either in his owne Time or any former Age: Yet are these, imbellishments to History ; being writ rather to beautifie than confirme; and to cheere the conceit, than to enforce it to an improbable beliefe. No doubt, but many of those Eminent Hero es, whom Time either flattered, or Oracles deluded, or some other selfe- opinionate Conceit transported, were incouraged to designes of infinite difficulty, to prove themselves descended from a Deity. Besides this, they imagined, being so descended, they were invulnerate. This it was, which put them on Actions above conceit, to disperse their Fame, and preserve that Opinion which the Age reteined of their descent.  145 Howsoever, excellent Emblemes were shrcuded under those Poeticall Fictions. Hirsut ae nuces optimos praebent nucleos . The shell may seeme meane, but the kernell sweete. When Achylles , that glory of the Grecians , had expos'd himselfe to all dangers, that Hostility or the force and fury of an Enemy could presse upon him; in the end, hee was wounded in the heele; for there onely, as the Po ets feigne, he was mortall, and consequently vulnerable. This includes a darke but dainty Morall. Many, howsoever they come on bravely, and can endure not onely the first brunt, but expresse a wondrous height of resolution, during all or most part of the heate of the day, yet in the heele ; are they wounded. They crowne not the Day of their Actions with a glorious Evening, but faile most when the Merit of their Actions should be most shining. For in this should every Heroick Spirit imitate the Sunne; whose property it is to shew most beauty in the Setting: so they, more in their Close than their Beginning. Yet, were these Historicall Inventions of the Poets, touching the Generation of the Gods ; in many respects defective, and in some absurd. Especially, in portraying of them aged, or addicted to some vicious quality or other: wherein they seemed to confound Mortality with Immortality: a pure integrious estate with impiety. For the first, it was an excellent Saying of Theocritus , who observing that popular stupidity of such as reposed their sole confidence in Idols, with the vanity of them: seeing, how even those Gods, whose Modells they reteined, and to whose memories they were erected, were translated or removed none knew whither; incouraged those who suffered for their Contempt towards those Pagan Deities in this manner:"  146 Be of good courage, when Gods dye before Men . Againe, speaking of a Mute Deity :  147 Wherein can that Goddesse availe him that worships her, who cannot speake to him that worships her ? So as Tullus Hostilius putting  148 pitty (saith Lactantius) that ever his Gods should goe from him. Notwithstanding all this, in the relation of their actions and such intervening Occurrents as hapned in their Oppositions, they deserve applause; though no credible approvement. And the more to be admired were their descriptions, in regard they fixed on no other Story either Transcribed, or any other way delivered, then what invention had first moulded aud recommended to posterity. Yet observe what congruity these held, both in describing them what they were, from whence they came, what exploits they did, with the severall Offices to which they were designed, or rather Originally interessed: and those distinct passages of their lifes, with the concurrency of opinions touching their birth, continuance and increase, cannot chuse but beget wonder. You shall not find in any one of these, peculiar Offices confounded: Liber must not intermeddle with the care of the Vines ; nor Neptune play the Mercurist . Distinct Offices were recommended to severall supposed Deities: and this the antient Ethnicks held with such ceremonious reverence, as nothing could be with more solemnity observed. For the latter, absurdity ; wherein the Pagans made their Gods addicted to all vice and impiety: This might have declined them from such adoration; when those Persons whom they so highly honoured, deserved in their actions so little imitation. But to take Survey of those contests or civill Warres amongst themselves, either arising from precedency; or grounded upon jealousy, or some other occasionall distaste, would beget a deserving admiration in any judicious Reader: observing, what Historicall Art derived her light from invention, and in what excellent order disposed, though restrained by rules of dimension. Lucian deserves his place, whose otherwise ill-deserving parts, being a profest foe to all divine adoration, purchased him an end as miserable as his prophanations merited: being devoured by Dogges: yet in this regard wee have propounded our Opinion about Historicall fictions, I will give him his due place: one of an excellent Wit, ripe Understanding, and laborious withall, to find out the ancient Manuscripts, and records of authorized Histories: yet, for asmuch as his writings are interlarded now and then with invective speeches against the Coelestiall Powers, arguing too much of Natures power, too little of the Soveraigne of Nature: I would have the Generous Reader to prepare himselfe in the perusall of such Discourses, as Calipso instructed Vlysses against the Sirens Inchantments, thus inviting him:  149 Huc ades o ingens Graecorum gloria Vlysses, Siste Ratem &c .---Thus Englished. Come hither Noble Ithacus, of valiant Greekes the choice, Take harbour here, incline thine care unto the Sirens voice: For there nere was any did passe, since we arrived here, This liquid way, but wisht to stay, our warbling notes to heare. Hence pregnant wits, and ripe conceits much knowledge have conceiv'd: As for the acts you did at Troy, we newes long since receiv'd. And how the Gods pursu'd the Greekes, the Trojans Greekes pursue, The Grecians hate in sacking Troy, Heavens hate in wracking you. Of these Inchantments did Calypso fore-warn Vlisses with this preparation, that hee should command his Associates in his ship, to bind him, when hee approached neere those fatall Harmonists, and to stop their eares, least they should be made a prey to their cruelty. So must every one prepare himselfe in such Siren-discourses. The liberty of these times, perswades some too easily to Lucians arguments: and those which (in feare of divine power) dare not deny the Omnipotency of the Immortall power in word, yet their prophane conversation implies an absolute Apostacy in them in their workes. I wish these digressions were not needfull: for then I might more directly proceed in my discourse, which the depravednesse of times will in no case suffer. 150 But in these feigned Histories I wholly exclude all ribaldry; times themselves have instruction sufficient for obscene subjects, without any further excitements: nor can I admit, that those unprofitable Stories of Primalion, Palmerin de Oliva, The Knight of the Sunne, Gerilion , with many other fictive Discourses, should be entertained by Youth. Many of these Relations have strangely transported divers well-promising Wits into strange amazements; especially such as conceive more delight in them, than more serious studies. Some wee have heard, that in reading the strange adventures of Orlando Furioso , and conveying the very impression of his amorous passion to themselves, would presently imitate his distraction, run starke naked, make Lovesongs in commendation of their Angelic ae , put themselves to intollerable torments to gaine the affection of their supposed Mistresses. Others, in imitation of some valiant Knights, have frequented Desarts, and uninhabited Provinces, ecchoing in every place their owne vanities, endorsing their Names in barkes of Trees, wholly turned savage and untractable, to personate that Knight more lively. Such Histories I onely allow of (whether in  151 Prose, or Verse, for Epicks may be writ in either) as yeeld profit with delight; not subjecting their discourse to observe some indiscreet Humour of the Time, for application, but prevention. Many read, and (in the loosnesse of their owne lives) make application of the worst unto themselves; hoping with Herostratus , to be memorable for villany: These are like Spiders, that turne the sweetest and most wholesome flowers to ranke poyson; the discredit of an History, and a great strengthener of vice. 152 And here might I take occasion, to fall upon a just reproofe of uselesse Readers of Histories; with such, as cull onely grounds for themselves, to comply with their owne desires: As the Ambitions ; who reflects onely upon high a ery Spirits: but never makes any use of their fall. An aspiring Philotas is the Object hee eyes, and his designes, the Coppy after which he moulds his Actions. Oh, how highly is hee transported,  153 when he sees Ambition mounted: looking ever after Hamons Honour, but seldome or never on his Ladder? Indirectest paths are the wayes hee most affects: and like a youthfull Ascanius , scorns to walke in common tracks, or to converse with ought lesse than Empires. Hee holds Opinion with that Universall Monarch, that "Kingdomes got by descent, derive to their possessors no personall merit. He had rather win than inherit; atchieve by the Sword, than enjoy by succession. Such as these say with Tiridates in Tacitus; To. Tacit. 154 reteine their owne, is in the power of every private State; but to ayme at that which is anothers, is a Princely praise  . This it was (as I have elsewhere observed) that caused Themistocles to walke in the Night-time in the open streete, because hee could not sleepe [illeg.] the Reason whereof when some men enquired, who were to him more intimately endeered, he answered, that the Triumph  155 of Miltiades would not suffer him to take his rest. So impatient of rest is Ambition, as it cannot endure either Competitor or Equall, but a reflexe had to them infinitely distracts him: so as, he cannot possibly enjoy himselfe, because he envies their greatnesse, whom generall Opinion holds either equall or transcendent to himselfe. It is no lesse to be wondred at, with what serious attention these ambitious Fire.flies , who ever singe their wings in the flames of their owne aspiring, read, and discusse every circumstance tending this way; with a personall application to themselves; as if they were the men which the History aym'd at: and whose Actions, they hope, e'relong, will beget an Iliad to succeeding times, to admire their valour; and to erect surviving Trophies to their surviving honour. Thus doe they catch at shadows, leaving the substance to such judicious and competible Readers; who make use of those ancient Records to their benefit: in collecting what is most usefull, and with a discreet aversion sleighting whatsoever might be occasionally hurtfull. Nor be these High-flyers, who seldome goe gray-headed to their Graves, onely reproveable in the abuse of their Readings; but the voluptuous 156 too: who, when they fall upon any passage that complies with the lightnesse of their fancy, so highly affect it, as nothing more delights them, than to discourse of such ayry pleasures, as present themselves in a cursorie manner to their deluded conceits. These are altogether for Stories of Love; where every Line workes such moving impressions in their unsteady fancies: as they reduce every period of Loves discourse, to a Sceane of Action; wherein they wish themselves Prime- actors, to close in a personall re-greet, with so light and sensuall a Relation. Ganimedes Rape; La is loose Love; white teeth, rolling Eyes, displayed Breasts; a winning Looke, a Cerusse Cheeke; a beautifull complexion (an exteriour good, and if corrupted, an interiour evill) being that which Euryala so much praised, when she washed the feet of Vlysses , namely, Gentle speech and tender flesh : these are proper Subjects for these light- fancied Amorists. I must confesse, that no History can be so serious, but it must upon occasion relate some lighter passages, which equally poised according to the time, should not breed these effects; but rather beget in a Continent and well- composed Reader, a detestation of whatsoever he shall finde vicious: and an ardent desire after that which shall appeare truely generous and vertuous. Alc aeus , a man of good reputation, and generall observance in the Common- wealth, what toies wrot he of the love of yong-men, immixing sometimes those lighter fancies in his seriousest Subjects? All the Writings of Anacreon (as if those Discourses had got highest place in his Invention) were onely of love. But most of all others, Rheginus even burned with Love, as appeareth by his Writings; being continued passages of winning delight: and intrancing the unwary peruser of his amorous Conceits, with deceiving shaddowes. Yea, even Philosophers, (and that by the Councell and Authority of Plato , whom therefore Dicearchus did worthily reprehend) became the Commenders and Honourers of Love. For Dicearchus , a Silician Philosopher, and Aristotles Scholler, Writing a Booke of the Spartan Common-wealth, distasted highly the opinion of such, who bearing the style of grave and reverend Men, gave way in their Workes, that any liberty should be introduced into a civil state: or authorized any Labours, were they Historical, Po eticall or Mixt, to have freedome in corrupting youth, or depraving the prime seedes of easie and pliable dispositions. These, who stand thus affected, and whose Readings are soly fixt upon sensuall delights; it were fitting for them to weane their affections, at least, to divert their eyes from those sensible Objects, which ingage reason to the servile Obedience of appetite, and to re- collect their Diviner parts , to patternes of continence: such as may informe them what to do; how to remove occasions: and consequently, free their inward Mansions or Receptacles from these corruptions. An excellent Patterne or incomparable Mirror in the command or Soveraignty of his affections, did that yong man Spurin ae in Valerius Maximus , shew himselfe,  157 whose beauty did so infinitely become him, as it occasioned many Women to lust after him: which this noble youth no sooner perceived (note this admirable act in a Pagan) then hee wounded his face, that by the skar he sustained, his beauty might become more blemished, and consequently, all occasion of lusting after it, clearely removed. Diverse instances, though not altogether so impressive, might be here inserted, tending to like use; but brevity, as it is the helpe of Memory, so my desire is to accommodate the Reader with instances usefull and commodious, rather then unnecessarily numerous. 158 Nor be the Covetous , (if their desire of gathering may admit so much time as to peruse an History in a whole age) lesse reprooveable in this kinde. For these, if they finde one Worldly wise; no matter though he not onely grounded but improved his estate by Extortion, and raised his posterity to an unknowne Title of Gentry by deceit and collusion: yet must his life and actions be the line of their directions. They looke not on Midas fate, but his golden state. Tagus they desire, nor care they much (so they may purchase it) to be drowned in it. These hold no substance to be purely good, unlesse it be guilded with gold. These never remember the saying of that wise Simonides ; who being asked once, whether Vertue or Riches were of more reputation; made answere, That the vertuous did more frequent the doores of the Rich, then the Rich of the vertuous . Implying, that piety was for the most part attended on by pouerty; but seldome was vertue accompanied by prosperity. Now to apply an antidote to this infection, and cure in them this distemper'd affection; as the Vnicornes Horne is of such soveraigne vertue, as being dipt in water, it cleares and purifies it: so must their earthy depressed mindes be purified by some powerfull infusion, or they will never endure to alter their disposition. To remove then those scales which darken their intellectuall part; their only safe course is to withdraw themselves a little from talking with Earth: and to fix the eye of their Contemplation on a diviner Object; the Store-house of Heaven, The vanity, frailty and mutability of the one, will inhance the quality and dignity of the other. The meere mentall observance of these, without any further experience, (wherein Historicall examples will affoord no small light) cannot chuse but qualifie their Temper, and enforce them to crye out with that Divine father: O how miserable is the World, 159 and how miserable they who follow the World! seeing, that men of this World have alwayes excluded their workes from partaking of life in the World to come. Thus have we traced over the various paths of three vicious Readers, all others may be in these included, who make not that benefit of History , to which it was primarily addressed; but by fruitlesse  & unnecessary observations; disparrage their owne judgments, in preferring those before passages of more high and usefull consequence. So as, I may properly resemble them to  160 Vselesse Travailers , who take notice of such things as are most frivolous, or what is worse, vicious. Others there be, that transported onely with the delight and present variety of the History, make History onely (as our Gallants do their Tobacco) a spender of Time: They apply not the fruit or use of Histories, but as in some pleasant or delightfull dreame, satisfied for the present time; but past, quite razed out of Memory. In stories of this nature, (such I meane as be feigned) I approve of those best that resemble Truth the neerest, according to Flaccus opinion: Ficta voluptatis caus a sint proxima veris. For the impossibility of the Relation oftentimes maketh the Subject more ridiculous: whereas the concordancy, or apt connexion of the History (though the maine plot be false) enforceth more attention. And thus much of Po eticall Histories : I will come to the second Branch of my Division of Histories (to wit) Morall. \------------------------------ 161 Morall Histories be such, as conduce to a Civil and Morall institution of Life or Manners; Teaching what is to be done, and what avoided. Xenophon in his Instruction of Cyrus , propounds what reasons should especially induce a Morall Historian to speake more of examplary Motives to Vertue, then any thing else; "Because (saith he) if Cyrus had not bin elected King amongst Shepheards, it may be, he had never reigned over the Persians : but the very Title, which was given him by Rurall Swaines, enforced him to attempt further. Morall Histories teach Men to behave themselves in all affaires: If imployed in Embassages, Commerce, or any Negotiation whatsoever, it directs them how to hazard fairely, beare themselves discreetly, and support the burthen imposed on them stoutly. These kind of stories are the best Nurses, they weane us from childish effeminacy, and Traine us in more virile and Man-like actions: so as Education is called by the Philosopher, A second Nature , habituating us to the kind of our breeding: Morality likewise is called, the Soveraignesse of Education, The square of humane Actions, the best Schoole-mistresse for unbridled youth, that restraines affections raging, erects our passions too much asswaging, tempers our spirits, and Reduceth us to that perfect Symmetry, Vt ex pede Herculem , you may know Hercules by his foote, the inward habit by externall appearance. Hence was it that Alexander gloried so much of his Stagyrian Moralist: Achylles of his Phoenix : of whom he had received so much good, as hee ingeniously acknowledged; by Phoenix he could both, Bene dicere, & bene agere. To be briefe, there is no exorbitancy in Nature, which by Morall Narrations hath not bin reformed: Seneca was naturally covetous: which disposition, or malady rather, he shrowds covertly in that sentence of his, inserted in his Book, De Tranquillitate Anim ae. Nec aegroto, nec valeo . Yet by daily conference with Morall Histories, and precepts of civill Institution, he could moderate his desire of having, esteeming the Treasure of his minde onely worth possessing. Qui cuncta habet, nec tamen habetur : as Salust observeth. The like we read of Stilpho , a Roman , whom (as Cicero speaketh) was of all other most libidinous; yet by reading of Morall Precepts, amplified with grave Examples, became most continent. Whence it is, that Morall Histories, or Narrations  162 in such Histories, are and were ever highly commended, by reason of their effects: especially in Youth, whose disposition being aptly compared to a cleare or pure Table, which, as yet had never taken any impression, receives her first infusions with most retention. For the first Seeds take the deepest roote; the first Liquors strongest taste; the first Colours truest dye. These, by certaine innate sprinklings of goodnesse, conferre the Lives and Actions of such, as they read of, in an equall Diameter. Here they observe, how prudently such persons managed their affaires; how discreetly they moderated their affections: and with what facility and felicity they attained their proposed ends. By which they collect, that deliberation promiseth successe to every action. Amongst these, they finde a Fabius more prosperous by delaying; than heady Cethegus is by attempting. This teacheth them wisely and cautiously to prevent danger before it approach, lest a too late had I wist beget in them a Repentance without helpe; a desperate repulse without hope. It is written that the Emperour Titus (that dainty Darling of Mankind ) used to have borne before him a Dolphine wreathed about an Anchor, with this Impresse: Festina lent e . Which elegant Embleme they make excellent use of: They conceive by this, how nothing can be done happily, that is done hastily: and that nothing of  163 high importance can possibly be atchieved, being to any strict limit or compasse of time confined. The consideration of these Motives holds them from rashnesse; an errour to which unbounded Youth is commonly most subject: by which meanes they avoid those many dangers, whereto the follies of Youth stand too frequently ingaged. Nor doe they onely finde Instances worthy their Imitation in Subiects of prevention and cautious providence: (a Lesson of necessary consequence for Yong-men;) but in actions of Iustice ; where that which is right and just, should be fairely and freely rendred to every man. Of this, they finde sundry singular Examples in Ethnicke Authors. Phocion , that Honour of Greece , will not speake for Charilus , though he be his Sonne in Law, but in just Causes onely. Nor that Worlds Commander, the invincible Alexander , incline to his Mother, if her Request tend to the shedding of innocent blood, or imbruing his imperiall hands in Murder. Nor that unhappy Mithridates suffer (in his respect of Justice) the corruption of Acilius to passe unpunished: lest his Impunity might become a Priviledge to others, to challenge the like benefit. In these they observe of what esteeme the profession of Justice was in all Ages: and how a native Instinct wrought such incredible effects on Barbarous people; as their very Actions merited both imitation and admiration in their Successours. Neither could the Philosophers of those times, wherein they flourished, be more exact in defining what Justice was, than these were in performing what Justice requir'd. For our Life, as it is a Globe of Examples; so by collecting whatsoever wee see imitable in others; if we tender our owne well-being, or her breast from whence we had our nursing and first being; wee will take especiall care to expresse to life, whatsoever wee have at any time read commendable in others. In Arguments likewise of Temperance , they cull out many dainty Historicall Flowers; apt to sweeten the Seed-plot of their Youth with a select variety of Examples. Yea, even in those Encounters, wherein the Conquest appeares to be of most difficulty; to wit, restraint of our desires in sensuall Objects: wherein the Victory is so much more glorious, as the opportunity and motive of their fancy attractive or precious. They read how Scipio , being a young man of Twenty foure yeeres of Age, in the surprizall of a City in Spaine , repressed his flames of lust, and confined his desires to the Rule of Reason, when a beautifull Maid was brought him; restoring her untoucht with a great Reward to young Allantius , to whom she was espoused. The like in Alexanders Continency to Darius Wife and Daughters; whose Princely moderation and command over his affections, made his Memory no lesse glorious than his Victories. The like in Zenocrates , a right Philosopher, because of himselfe an absolute Commander; who remaines immoveable in his resolution to Continence, amidst all those voluptuous inducements, sensuall provocations and enticements, lascivious dalliance and embracings of a light-licentious La is . From the perusall of these they conclude, " There is nothing comparably precious to a continent Soule. Lastly, to (exemplifie in each of our Cardinal Vertues, what rare effects may be derived to Youth in these Historicall Readings) they observe the Constancy and Resolution of forraine Commanders; they admire their Fortitude , and bravenesse of spirit. Neither can Pyrrhus Gold corrupt, nor his hideous Elephant amate a Noble Fabius. Though an Imperious Philip threaten an Athenian Legat, that hee will cause his Head to be cut off; he has an Answer in store to vye with the  164 mounting Soveraignty of his State: " If thou take this Head from me, my Countrey will give me another that shall be immortall. And they finde how gratefull some Princes were in the memory of their Subjects Loyalty; holding their fidelity and trust to be the incomparablest Treasure that any Prince could enjoy upon Earth. This they conceive by the estimate which Darius made of his Zophyrus, Cyrus of his Cambyses; Alexander of his Parmenio, Athens of her Draco; Epaminondas of his Pelopidas, Sparta of her Brasidas. In these, they exactly prize the value of true worth. Nor is it to be expressed with what eagernesse they pursue those actions, which have purchased such deserving fame to their persons. It is reported, that Aristides (that memorable Mirror of Iustice) dying of the bite of Weazle, exceedingly lamented that it was not a Lyon. Noble spirits embrace nothing with more easie acceptance then an Honorable fate. To die for ones Country; or to be ingaged to the very worst of extreames for the purchase of her liberty, deserved no solemnization in teares: This when youth seriously surveies, he no lesse affectionately admires; and desires nothing more then to go on successively in a glorious emulation of their actions. The infirmities of this time are great, and need the hand of an expert Physitian; no Medicine, nor Antidote, more soveraigne to cure these contagious Ulcers, then Morall Physicke, if the Disease be greene, (I meane the diseases of the Mind:) We have here Lenitives to mittigate, if it be old, and growne to a ![](/images/inline/sb.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , a very Gangrene, griefes insensible, being most incurable. We have Corrasives to eate away all those corrupt  165 Tetters that hinder the Cure. This is a singular Art, and farre surpassing Galens, Æsculapius , or Hypocrates : Their cures were but externall, these internall: and so much more worthy is the cure of the Minde then the Body, by how much the one is more precious then the other. O Divine Art! O secret Mystery! The Greeks called this Discourse, The life of Man : for without it, he would degenerate from Man, and loose the best ornaments of Humane nature: The light of Reason, The Eye of Election . ![](/images/inline/rb.gif) Ogr; ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  ! great indeed, in comparison of the small esteeme this World makes of it: labouring of a great burthen of impiety, an huge freight of sin, an insupportable carriage; and feeling her owne strength unfit for such a weight, yet refuseth to entertaine a companion that would willingly and readily lighten her burden. Distempered Age, that labours of Minds phrensie, captivated to unworthy bondage: how long will thy intellectuall eye be shut? How long hood winckt? If thou fall with open eyes, thy Misery is greater, seeing thy fall, yet would not prevent it, falling with blinded eyes: no marvell, that sees thine owne infirmity, and scornes the direction of others eies to conduct thee. Alas! here be many intricate Mazes, unfrequented Labyrinths, places of imminent perill, and thou art blind: no suspect of any Stratagem or Ambush doth possesse thee; thou promisest thy selfe most security, when most beleagured with perill. It was no marvell if miserable Oedipus run into Brakes and Briers, when his erring feete were guided by two blind eyes? Here be many seducements: and as in the Pagan time, there were more Temples erected in honour to Bacchus and Venus , than to Iupiter and Apollo : So for one Example of Piety and Religion, we have ten of Vice and Licentiousnesse. Here the bait of Ambition, hung out and swallowed, and like enough by a Gudgion; there the painted Flagge of vainglory,  166 leading a Troupe of Vices in a Ringdance: Here a Silken Foole well-esteemed--- for  167 Nasci a Principibus fortuitum est \---Hee was borne rich: There a ragged Sage descanting on Morall Precepts, but neither garded nor regarded.  168 Here Rosa Mundi , the Rose of Worlds vanity, set on a splay-foote, making Art a cover for Natures deformity: There a plume of Feathers dangling on a Head more light than Feathers, to  169 make Plato's naked Definition of Man true: Homoest Animal bipes, implume : proving himselfe by his Plume to be none. No matter for Reason: They would be loath to be indued with more than is needfull for a phantasticke head: An ordinary portion of Reason will serve an Ordinary. Oh that these poiselesse Braines would but imploy their time in Morall Discourses, what excellent matter might they finde out worthy the judicious approbation of refined Wits! It is observed that in Athens , and in Rome also, young Gentlemen were to be imployed in preferring some Law in behalfe of the people: or Patronizing such as were poore, and destitute of succour in themselves: Patronizing such, and protecting them in publick defence of their cause, or the like. This was the first step of preferment unto Cicero , defending Roscius against Scylla : and that with such vehemency, as generally hee was approved for his seriousnesse in a poore Actors cause. And sure, generous mindes cannot be better expressed than in actions of this nature, whereby they may not onely secure themselves and their entirest affections from the frivolous assaults of irregular perturbations; but also purchase unto them the generall love and favour of such as observe their disposition, and admire it. By Morall reading we use to be most excited to these compassionate effects: exampled in them  170 whom wee deservedly thinke of, and earnestly covet to imitate: Not taxing them unworthily, nor commenting otherwise of their Vertues, than as we receive by Transcription from others. Former Ages (in this kind) have beene more charitable, but the apprehension of our owne defects makes us suspectfull of others. As in  171 Rome , if the Pisoes be frugall, they are censured Parcimonious; if the Metelli Religious, they are taxed Superstitious; if the Appij Popular, they are tearmed Ambitious; if the Manlij Austere, they are styled Tyrannous; if the Lelij Wise, they  are Curious; the Publicoloe Aspiring, if Courteous. Many such Mamothrepts we have, that censure others actions to the worst, making their owne depraved Judgments Censors of others Vertues. But Morall Precepts would remedy this Obliquity, and will us first be Masters of our Affections, e're wee fish in the troubled waters of other mens errours: But this Age confirmes the Assertion of a wise Roman Senatour: Suam cuius a culpam Authores ad causam transferunt : Or, which Seneca writes in his Epistle to his friend Lucil. Many (saith hee) my friend Lucilius commit faults in Rome, but will in no case heare that they committed them: the Ædile layes blame upon the Questor, the Questor on the Praetor, the Praetor on the Consul, the Consul on the Censor, the Censor on the Dictator. Apologizing and defending Errours, the greatest cherisher of them: For how is it possible wee should amend them, that will not confesse wee did commit them? But Acknowledgment is a precedent Directresse to Reformation, according  172 to the Traged : words: Quem poenitet peccasse, pen e est innocens. 173 It is an infallible Theorem; " Humility is the way to Glory . Which can be expressed in nothing better, than in a free and genuine submission of our owne Judgments to others. Too much confidence begets strength of Errour: and he is the wisest, who in his owne conceit appeares humblest. Great Apprebation is then to be given to such, who tender an acknowledgment of their errours, whether it be in their Dialect and forme of speaking, or manner of living: with an ingenuous submitting of their Labours to the free censure of others: which argues a great measure of Scbrietv and Discretion in any: Whereas Selfe- conceit is a blemish to the exactest Labours: Neither shall such Authors free themselves from malicious Censures. Rhemnius Pal aemon that arrogant Grammarian,  174 or rather Grammatist, vaine-gloriously boasted, that good Literature had first life by him, and should after dye with him (as having the first beginning, and should have a finall end with him:) or like Gorgias the Orator, who ever prest himselfe forward to the first Encounter. But what do'es this vaine-glory beget them, but contempt and derision in such as observe them? The Age is subject enough to Errour, and apt enough to Apologize Vice, to give more liberty to the Offender. The way to breake this Chaine, is to lay aside our selves, and impartially to judge our selves and actions, as if they were not Ours, but Others. For this Selfe-love makes us admire, what in others wee abhorre. A retyred privacy, many times, promiseth to the unwary delinquent, more freedome in offending: but vaine and fruitlesse are these promises. Is there any darknesse so thicke and palpable, that the piercing Eye of Heaven, which takes a full and perfect view of the whole Earth at once, measures the very least drop of the Ocean, and numbers the least portion of Sand upon the shore, cannot looke thorow it? Oh, if thou hope by sinning secretly to sinne securely, this thy ungrounded security shall bring thee to misery. It was a pretty saying of Epicurus in Seneca; "How can Sinne be safe when it cannot be secure? Or to what purpose is it to labour to lye hid, when that we doe cannot be hid ? And therefore Prudentius in one of his Hymns, gives this good Memorandum : "What e're it be thou do'st by Day or Night, Thinke with thy selfeth art alwayes in Gods sight. It was Seneca's Counsell to his friend Lucilius ; that whensoever he went about to doe any thing, he should imagine Cato Or Scipio , or some other 175 worthy Roman to be in presence. And it was the saying of St. Bernard, That we are ever to set some good man before us, that we may live as if he looked over us. The way then to cure sinne, is not to shroud it, nor with faire pretences to guild it, or by imputing the Cause to others, to mince it; but by a free and ingenuous discovery of it, to acknowledge the ground to proceed from our selves: Which acknowledgment will bring us to rectifie what is amisse: and bring that which we have so rectified, by a proficiency in goodnesse, to more perfection. For what is it, with Alcibiades , that beauty of Athens , to be skilfull in all Arts and Exercises; to winne the Palme in what enterprize wee take in hand; to be popularly affected; with Trophies and Triumphs honoured; and to have the Wheele of Fortune so fixt, and the Wings of Victory so clipt, as the former may never have power to discard us, nor the latter to flye from us: When our Inward beauty , farre surpassing all these light Embellishments of Art, becomes blemished by that staine, which holds so deepe a dye, as Time cannot raze it, nor ought but Infamy attend it? The way then to cure Errour, is to submit our Judgments to others censure: and in a wise and cautelous distrust of our selves, to admit the advice and assistance of others in any matter of ambiguity; lest wee deceive our selves by being too confident of our owne strength. That saying is true: "Hee that seekes to be more wise than hee can be, shall be found lesse wise than he should be. The best Doctrine then to initiate us how to be wise, is not to be selfe-wise; but with an humble acknowledgment of our owne deficiencies, to ascribe all praise unto Him who is solely wise. In Morall Studies, much excellent matter may be chosen out of that Mirror of Morals, Plutarch ; not onely to instruct Youth, in the Rudiments and Precepts of Vertue: As how to beare himselfe in all occasions; how to conceale and smother his passions, with a wise over-mastring of his Affections; and how to redresse the multiplicity of injuries by taking opportunity by the Fore- top. But even old men likewise, such as have seene many changes and alterations in their Times, and were well nigh perswaded, that all the Volumes of the World could not shew them more, than they in the revolution of their Times had seene: But seeing Instructions rare to them, and unaccustomed Precepts fit for the maturest Head to plod on, they then confesse that their old Age hath beene a Dotage, verifying, Addiscendo, se semper senescere : Reaping more profit by one Morall precept, then a whole yeares Experience in Worldly affaires. Many old men we have (that can discourse of the change of Princes) whose Gray- haires be as  176 so many records of what they have seene. But alas, conferre with them of true Morall experience, and you shall finde them as young in hours, as old in yeares: Their knowledge in the Infancy, though their one foot in the grave, ready to bid adiew to the world, when they are scarse halfe erudiated in the preventive sleights of this world. A simple age! when we have no other Testimony that we have lived long, save onely our Gray-haires; and yet the general ignorance pleads pardon: none so generous as those which know the least, none of a ranked spirit, that will cast the eye of a judicious applause, upon the meriting Labours of any man. 177 .Wherein, should I fall upon reproofe of the Age, in her dis-esteeming Authors: and sleighting their Labours; mine Oyle might seeme to taste of too much Criticisine: for the Professors of Learning, they must not expect all Times nor all Eminent persons to have Scales in readinesse to weight their Merits. For the Rich , whose thriving wayes will afford him scarce time to converse either with Wit or Learning, lest his providence in the meane time should be a wanting to himselfe, which he preferres before all the World; so hee finde graines enough to weigh his long-unseene Gold; he little cares how lightly Learning weigh in the estimate of men. For, good man, he makes no other use of Bookes, than Nurses doe of Cradles, to rocke Babes in till they fall asleepe. And for our Amorous Gallant , whose Cinnamon Rinde is worth all the body beside; hee is so continually practising in the Schoole of Complement; First, for accommodating himselfe in an handsome dresse, then how to weare it when he h'as crept into it; how to ruffle his boote, and make a gingling with his Heele, as if all his patrimony were behind him; how to powder his lockes, and sweeten those constant Creatures which familiarly attend him; how to besprinkle his effeminate face with Lady-like Love-spots , which cannot chuse but be as so many Lures to draw the eyes of his lightest Livia to looke on him. These, I say, being his daily exercise, will not admit him so much time as to talke with an Author: Till his long training in the Schoole of vanity hath taught him so much, as he needes no other Tutor then his owne mis- spent time to admonish him of his irregular course. Nay, he leaves for most part, so small a portion of fortune to himselfe, as the surplusage would scarce purchase his Author so much oyle as might supply his Lampe, in the composure of the most illaborate or compendious Labour. But if at any time, his hand chance to dive into his pocket, to expresse his bounty to the Muses; it may be properly sayd of him, what was sometimes spoken by an other in the same sense: "Optimas gaz as insimis servavit chartis : Making onely choice of such for Objects of his bounty, whose light unstudied Lines detract from the Muses beauty. Nor are they to expect, that our- High-mounting Cedars ; whose Object is Honour; which rather than they will not purchase, they lose themselves for ever: can deigne to reflect on such Low shrubs . For of all others, Subjects of Learning receive hardest digestion from Ambition. Lectures of Morality or Mortality can worke weake Impressions upon a restlesse aspiring fancy. Composed mindes, setled thoughts, retyred Mansions are Receptacles for the Muses. 178 Safe lay I hid, and free from Envies spite, While Corsick Rocks were my retired site. So spake Seneca for a Seneca . yea, I have knowne some of these, never truely happy, till they became unhappy: receiving their most liberty from restraint; and the best knowledge of themselves from a Grate. Then, and never till then, did these begin to read Man; nor to conceive the fraile condition of Man; nor to converse with those Dead Councellors , which know  179 best how to prepare and accomplish Man. Then, and never till then, came Learning to be of Request, or in their Bookes. So lightly is Learning favoured, so meanely countenanced by such as Idolatrize the World, or are affected to pleasure, or have in eager pursuite the shade of Honour. But Learning is not hereby to be discouraged, because sleighted or desertlesly disvalued: This hath long before these present Times, bin her fate, and in all ages a common fault. Wee read in our owne Chronicles, how one yeare all the Laurell Trees within our Iland withered, and afterwards contrary to all expectation, revived and flourished againe: Let Learning apply this to Herselfe; though her blossomes seeme dead, shee retaines still life in the Root: Which, by propagation of her flowers and fruites, shall revive to her Honour; while ignorance buried in her owne ashes, and incapable of light or life, shall never recover. It is Recorded, that Licinius , Coleague in  180 the Empire with Constantine the Great (being uncapable of learning himselfe) by reason of the slownesse or barrennesse of his understanding, was wont to call Learning the very poyson and publicke plague, that infected the Realme: The Romane Historians, have applyed this vanity of his, rather to his want of judgement, then any thing else, being not able to comprehend the benefit of Arts. The like of Maximilian , who was desirous to  181 attaine some extraordinary height in Eloquence; which when he could not (by reason of his naturall dulnesse) attaine unto, hee envied and maligned others. Many have wee that second these, glorying in their owne ignorance, and making a ridiculous spectacle of Learning: as a superficiall ornament to accommodate more the threed-bare Sophister, than the Generous Gallant. I recall to minde the ancient presage upon all Arts, and the prediction concurres well with this time. Three halfe pence for a Philosopher, and smoake for a Counsellour . It was spoken in the declining Age of the Roman Empire, when Vice rode in his foot-cloath, and Vertue (like a poore Irish Lacky) ran at his Stirrep. But Morall Learning illumines the intellectuall power with a better and clearer fore-sight; shewing the difference betweene goodnesse and appearance: for true Morals love not to garnish their portraitures with shadows. 182 The best meanes to distinguish betwixt the ignorant and morally instructed, is to put them into their habilliments of Nature; send them both forth naked into the world, and their distinct Characters will appeare more manifest. Alas, the Moralist cannot discourse of what the World most affecteth; he sees the ambitious man roving at unsetled ends, meaning to ingrosse the whole World to himselfe; he smiles at his illimited desires, and wonders whereto his fond purposes tend: hee considers the event, ere hee take in hand the meanes; and hates desire of popular praise, or ostentation, lest he should grow  183 proud by forraigne observances: hee entertaines death with a cheerefull brow. Terror of death is not terrible to one prepared for her ere shee come; alwayes taking her, as one of the necessities of Nature, and inevitable, meditating of her, as one--- Quifinem vit ae extremum inter muner a ponit naturae . These considerations ever fortifie a good Morall against the violence of all assaults inward and outward; apprehending his substance, and composition, to be such as cannot barracadoe it selfe against the encounter of Nature. Agathosles , that Tyrant of Syracusa , in all his  184 tyranny, had a good Morall Statue to represent to him the Idiome of his Mortality; having the upper part of his Image made of Marble, Gold, and Ivory, but the feet of Earth; to intimate of  185 how weake and infirme ground, he and his goodly promising person stood. O! if we should but read the choyce variety of divinely-composed Sentences, comprised in those elaborate Works of the ancient Morall Historians: they would move us to no lesse apprehension of our owne weaknesse, than if some expert or curious Painter, ( Apelles -like) should portray to us every part and lineament of this little man we carry about us. Morality (saith a good 186 Morall) is Mans Anatomy; it shewes every part of his body, how composed, how disposed: and prescribes how this excellent composure may be best preserved: It deales not by predominancy of Planets, (as our ponderous burthens of Nature calculate) but by an even Symmetry of Vertues governing the inferiour Spheares, the bodies lineaments. Nor deales it is like your Phantastick Musitian , that bestows more charges on the Cover of his Instrument, than the Instrument it selfe: but by the Covers debasement, augments the Excellency of the Instrument, the divine faculties of the soule. But I may seeme to run too farre in this Subject, confounding Morall History with Philosophy: which though I might defend; for Morall Philosophy is nothing else than a Globe of Morall Precepts drawne from Historicall grounds; yet to make mine owne passage more smooth, I will descend to the next branch of History, intituled Physicall. \------------------------------ Histories Physicall , be especially conversant in the search of the Natures of things: approving that Opinion of the Philosopher: Ea Physica sunt, qu ae Naturas rerum explorare solent : whether things animate or inanimate; in living Creatures, as in the search of Beasts, Birds, Serpents, and the like; and of vegetive Bodies, as Plants: In creatures inanimate, as in the scrutiny of Mettals, the distinct natures of Stones, &c. With which Discourses the greatest Emperours  187 have beene delighted. Those admirable Works of Pliny, Aristotle , and Æ lian , with many others, are sufficient to erudiate the most incapable in these Relations: where they doe Abdita rerum rimari . Here describing the very intimate natures of Beasts, the rare and incredible vertues of Plants, and Hearbs, the virulent natures of Serpents, and the attractive powers of Stones,  188 Mettals, and the like. The Crocodile , a most dangerous Beast, (frequenting the River Nylus ) and a profest foe to Man: The Ichneumon , a little creature, yet powerfull in her selfe, and in her power a profest foe to the Crocodile. To take a more full Survey of the Natures of these, whosoever shall be pleased to peruse the  189 History of the West-Indies ; may find store of Relations of all sorts in this kind. As Wormes of strange qualities; Serpents of wonderfull proportions and features; venemous Vipers; of which whosoever are bitten, dye in short space: for few live to the fourth day, except present Remedy be applyed; which according to the  190 strength and constitution of the party wounded, receives effect sooner or later: but not without danger of death to the Patient, though the Soveraignst Receipts that the secrecy of Art may finde out, be used. Of other sorts likewise, there may be found some of that humane and sociable Nature, as they affect nothing more than the Feature of Man: eying him with such a loving and friendly admiration, as nothing seemingly delights them more than to behold him. Others, as if they reteined the memory of that ancient Serpentine malice betwixt them, and the Seed of the Woman, no sooner come in the presence of that Sexe, than they redouble their fury; and in their wounding so venemous and incurable, that One of them chancing to bite an Indian Maide, which served the Relator, during his aboad in those parts; after such time as he had caused the Surgians to Minister their ordinary cure, being not by all the Art and experiments they could use, able to do her any good, nor yet get one drop of blood  191 out of her, but onely a yellow water, dyed the third day for lacke of remedy, as the like had chanced to diverse others. During the time of her languishing, shee reported how the Viper which bit her on the foot, was two spannes long or little lesse: and that she lept in the aire for the space of more then sixe paces (note the virulency of her nature) that she might with more violence assaile her. The relation is strange of the Tarandula , a kind  192 of Spider bred in Pulia ; which being of a diverse nature, causeth diverse effects: causing some to dance, some to sing, or weep, or watch, or sweat: The cure of it is by Musicke: while the patient by dancing or some vehement exercise of that sort repels the poyson. 193 Which effects may imply excellent Morals: we are all subject not onely to be surprized but empoysoned by this Tarandula , this Tetter of our flesh; unlesse by sweet Melody of the Divine spirit she be charmed: yea, wee are sure to be discomfitted by Sloath, if we retyre our selves from action, or give way to her effeminacy, whose only ayme it is to bring us to inevitable Misery. Exercise then must be used, lest our baine be procured. The like Morall, without much enforcing, may be drawne from other creatures; and that with much propriety, in the Survey of Natures History. The Crab-fish , when as the Oyster doth open her selfe, casteth a stone into her shell; so as, being not able to shut herselfe againe, she becomes a prey unto the Crabbe . The Fathers apply this unto the Divell; when he findeth men gaping and idle, he casteth into them some stone of Temptation, whereby he workes their over-throw. For the Sloathful man is the Divels shop; there he works, ever busie when men are lazie. Many such singular Motives may the piercing Eye of the Soule extract from the natures of these  194 inferiour creatures: So as, though the very Locust , or Grashopper be but creatures of emptinesse, they retaine in them many wonderful occult qualities. Nay, the very Hedge-hog , being a creature (to use the words of a Divine Father) not excluded from Gods providence, presents herselfe a singular Embleme of pollicy and prevention, in her privacy and retirednesse. For this provident Creature hath two holes in his siege, one towards the South, an other towards the North. Now when the Southerne wind blowes, he stops up that hole, and turnes him Northward. Againe, when the Northerne wind blowes, he stoppes up that hole likewise, and turnes him againe Southward. Such Vrchins , strict Criticisme may terme Temporizers ; who are onely for complying with Time, seldome or never closing with Truth; but equally affected Naturalists have rather ascribed this to a provident Oeconomicall policy, than glozing flattery. To set downe the severall properties of all, or of most sorts of Beasts, would crave an ample Volume of it selfe: I will onely (as in my former discourse) expresse the use of Naturall Histories, and to what persons most accommodate. We read of divers most famous Princes and Monarchs to have applyed their mindes to the  195 search of these Studies: Alexander (otherwise most potent in Armes, and sole Commander of the World) addicted his minde to the scrutiny of these Rarities: as may appeare most manifestly by his Letter (at this day extant) to his Master Aristotle , containing the strange proportions of Beasts with their Natures; which during his Indian Warre, hee had observed: describing the strange and unheard-of qualities of the Indian Aspicks, Cerasts , and many other kinds of Serpents, continually infesting his Army; professing (as he himselfe writeth) hee found more difficulty in discomfiting Beasts, than subduing Men: for the one sort assaulted him, when his Troopes were well disposed, cheerefull, and full of alacrity: but the other invaded him by Night. It a ut ne in Castris quidem minimum ocij detur . Alwayes was this puissant Prince much given to see the naturall qualities of Beasts, so as no Present could be more gratefull, or acceptable to him, than some strangely- natured savage, making excellent use of this Theory, appropriated to the natures of Men: which upon all occasions, (with singular delight) he used to apply unto his Nobles disposition, which attended him. Those noble and couragious Dogs, which were  196 sent him by the Kings of Albany , much contented him: They would not stirre at small beasts, disdaining them (as it were) in the over-flow of their courage, contemning any encounter but with Lyons, and Elephants. This Magnanimity could the valiant Emperour apply well enough to himselfe: he saw his own nature delineated, or charactred (as it were) in their courage, Scorning to Triumph on the conquered, solacing him ever with this extreame, yet chearefull comfort: Superest Sperare Salutem. The like desire of exploring the naturall properties of Beasts, possessed Sertorius : One no lesse provident, to shelter himselfe in adversity, then in all his actions continent, amidst his prosperity; who, after his Regiment in Spaine , erected many places for the taming of wild Beasts, delighting exceedingly to see the aptnesse of some joyned with a certaine naturall flexibility, and the backwardnesse of others, retaining over a certaine  197 semblance of their first Nature, so deeply imprinted, as difficulty removed. Nay, what Stratagems used he (by his White Hart ) to support and governe the whole Fabricke of his declining Estate: Implying that by his Hinde, or Hart, 198 he received instructions from Diana , which the people (with such superstition) beleeved, that by his glory he conquered Envy, enlarging the bounds of his Jurisdiction, and making his exile the Symbole of his renowne, till by the bloody conspiracy of Perpenna and Antonius , he was deprived both of Crowne and Life. Demetrius a worthy Souldier, and one well meriting of his Countrey, was much inclined to this Study: So as at home, if at any time sequestred from his more serious Affaires, he conceived exceeding pleasure and delight in the portraying of those Beasts he had seene: Excellent hee was in the frame of any Similitude, but more divine in his owne; being of that exact forme, elegant constitution, and sweetly-mixt Complexion, Vt a pictoribus, Sculptoribusq ei similis non potuerit effingi : A rare Modell of Nature, when (by Nature) he was imparraleld. Alcibyades , no lesse deserving, yet worse censured, was well experimented in the Natures of  199 Beasts, but more in Plants: having an Hearbe, even to this day (amongst our Apothecaries) called after his Name, Alcybiadon , or the Wilde Buglosse. 200 And for Mettals, Minerals, or the like; None more accommodated to such Studies than that Soveraigne of Roman Hearts, Augustus , hearing his Lapidary Dioscorides with especiall delight: So as in time he was not onely able to distinguish of any Stone, but to describe their Natures: Using likewise the Art of Alchimy, more expert in their recalcinations (saith the Roman Historian) than the best Professours of that Time; and consequently I may conclude than the grosse Quacke-salvers of our Time. You see it is no disparagement for the Generous,  201 or Heroick Spirit to be Studied in these Notions: since the peerelesse for Valour and true Resolution, have dedicated themselves unto them: yet would I not have them so besotted, or be wedded to these studies, as to forget more important intendments. I confesse these are rather to make a man compleat, than exactly necessary, and a superficiall knowledge is sufficient for Learning of this Nature: And well doe I approve of that Ornament of Learning (the best Lustre to  202 the Schoole of Arts) where hee would rather have a Gentleman superficially seene in all, than profoundly learned in one. Too much retyring to these Studies, accord not with Gravity or State, but to discourse (by way of Reason) without Sophisticall argumenting, well beseemes the most Generous mindes. It is an happy thing to keepe a meane in Wisdome; not to strive (in an over- flow of Understanding) to out-strip Nature in the investigation or search of Naturall things: A little will serve us in indifferent things, and more it relisheth of Discretion, to know when wee have enough; than, with an unbounded will of affecting knowledge, superstitiously to know more than Nature hath prescribed. This excesse in desire of knowing, hath beene a contegion, that hath infected and poisoned the maturest Studies: especially in things so impertinent, as when the pitch of that they expected was attained, Their knowledge conduced no more to the profit of the Repub. than if with Endymion , they had slept their time, and passed their life over in a fruitlesse silence. In pleaseth the Orator to tearme such a Study--- Inutilis mentis agitatio : Sayling in the troubled streame, where a more cleare and calme passage doth shew her selfe. Thus I approve in these Naturall Discourses, a superficiall Discursive Knowledge, to exclude Ignorance, but no such affective height, lest in so exquisite a search of Nature, wee should shew our selves Naturals. We say, the Generous should be but Mediocriter doctus : I need not insist upon the perswasion; wee have too many of Iuvenals painted blocks in the way of Learning, that never meane to come nearer. So as I may answer,  203 as an Athenian reasoned, what the cause should be why there was such an ebbe of good Wits in Athens ? "Because (saith he) they runne into the Sub-urbs, and dwell with La is. The best and ripest Wits are most subject to corrupting, concording well with the native depravation of these Times, where Medea's Rule is made an Axiome, every one with Lincius seeing the best, but with blind Baiard , deprived of the Eye of their Election. Too much of them; our Treatise requires a better Subject, than such staines to their Countries fame, and pristine honour, making her complaine, as Rome did in time of old: Eone vos 204 produxi?  &c  . Is this the fruit of my long Labour, the freight of my race, and the reward of my Motherly love, to bring you up, and then (like Vipers) to sting me that hath nourished you? Well then, my blessings must be turned of necessity unto execrations: and that Breast which first nourished you with the Milke of comfort, must be the very Sepulchre to interre you that buried my honour. Thus did Rome hollow out her complaint against her ill-nurtured issue; and no lesse cause Albion against her undisciplined race, that seeme as if they were,--- Fruges consumere nati. And here I might preferre a just complaint against such, who consume the Oyle of their Life,  205 in frequenting Loose places : and apply some choice soveraigne Receipts, to rectifie this; to the end (than which no end more glorious) their owne Families may become private Academies . Which I shall the rather labour, in regard, that the regulating of our selves to that forme, may highly conduce both to our own  & Gods honor. How carefull the Romans were in their cessation from armes, to educate their youth in action, lest too much remissenesse might beget in them an effeminacy of manners; and so in time disable them for personall employments eyther at home or abroad, may sufficiently appeare by all those ancient Annals recommended from age to age, even to these our times. Whence it came, (as I have else where noted upon like occasion) that there was published an antient Edict amongst the Romans , as is recorded by Cicero in his Booke of Lawes, that no Roman should go through the street of the City, unlesse he carried with him the badge or cognizance of that Trade whereby he lived: Insomuch as, that  206 good Emperour Marc. Aurelius speaking of the dilligence of the Romans , writeth, That all of them followed their labour . An excellent commendation in a civill State; to banish that, by which the best States through a long continued peace, or affluence of wealth, have not only bin impeached and impaired, but rooted out and utterly razed. Idlenesse maketh of Men women, of women beasts, of beasts Monsters. I would have then these Patrons of Idlenesse (who consume the precious lampe of their life in a licentious liberty) used, as Zeno used his servant Bruson ; who being taken with Theft, and alledging for himselfe, that it was his destiny to steale; his Maister answered, and thy destiny to be beaten. It is the depraved nature of Man, to mould himselfe ever after Medeas rule; to see the best but to follow the worst ; nay, to make the worst use of that which in its owne nature is the best. For what more precious then the Palmes of Peace ? Yet, what is it that sooner corrupts the freest  207 State? For what is the progeny that a Calme time brings forth (all which implies the viciousnesse of our nature) but a Prodigall and an Vsurer ? Where the one ingageth his state for Backe and Belly; the other quite contrary, stands indebted both to Back and Belly. The one playes at Ducks and Drakes with pieces, till hee must fish for more when all his estate is falne in peeces; The other hoords up for his seldome thriving Heire; who meanes, as his father was the first, to make himselfe the last of his House. That Maxim is true; Health commeth not from the Clouds without seeking, nor Wealth from the clods without digging: yet, as there is required a providence in the one; so should there be a conscience in the other. Lycurgus banished  208 this Usury (the canker-worme of all civill Society) out of Sparta; Amasis punished it severely in Æ gypt; Cato banished it out of Sicilia : and Solon in Athens . How much more should it be holden in detestation amongst Christians? And for the other, who so hee may be styled a Young Master , will not stick to impawne the Long Acre , till hee become like a Snake who h'as casten his slough; a squeazed swad without either Meanes, Manners, or Mannor: I could wish that he took his Spunge by the hand, and tooke leave of this Iland together, till ayre had changed their condition, or Grace the quality of their Temper. As sometimes that worlds Monarch used two of his Court Parasites, injoyning the one to flye, and the other to follow him with a whip, till they were both got out of his Kingdome, and so his Court was rid of both. And to make up a lease in this vicious trace; it were not far amisse for the State, that such, who by petitionary wayes work their owne ends; and,  209 as if they were presenters of petitions by Pattent, make it their most commodious Trade, to delude the poore Supplicants trust: and to maintayne their profuse course, feed their languishing Clyents with unprofitable delayes, tasted of the whip as well as these. So that, as Alex. Severus (a great enemy to such Impostors) caused his corrupt Courtier Turinus in the open Market to be fastned to a stake and stifled with smoake; while the Cryer thus cryed to the people, " Let 210 him perish by smoake, who sold smoake . I could wish that such as these be (if any such there be) might receive the like censure, according to the height or measure of their distemper. For these, like Brokers of old-stuffe, or Barterers of contemptible ware, make sale of that which is not vendible. Or like those Asian Knights, make breach of credit to discharge their credit: who, though they have no other vocation but boldnes and insinuation, yet by these injurious wayes, beare themselves in the World as if they were persons of quality and fashion. But to proceed in our Discourse: Histories of this Nature, are very needefull for professors of Physicke: for how should they conceive the true Art of composition, if the simples whereof the compounds are made, and their vertues, be not perfectly knowne unto them? Brasevolus, de examine herbarum , exemplifies this Discourse more fully; I will referre them to that place, not entertayning that Subject which is but superficially traduced to me; and I have alwayes made that observance (in way of Axiome) to all my Readings, which Silvius in his Booke, De Simplicib. Medicament , injoyneth himselfe: What Art soever a Man knoweth, let him only exercise and use it: For otherwise he shall but descry his owne Ignorance, as I have noted in some: Quos cum nescire piguit, mentiri non pigebat . An odious scandall to a generous-minded Scholler, to write that which he is ignorant of himselfe; Lesse ashamed to lye, then to be defective in Knowledge. But especially, some we have of this sort, that lye upon their Knowledge: Some (as in Traians fabling Age) write Arts of Horsemanship, that never rode otherwise then Agesilaus with his Children on Cocke-horse. Others can exactly prescribe Times for Planting, Sowing, Reaping, and the like; playing the good Husband-man (I pray you marke him ) that never read Virgils Bucolicks : These are usurping wits, presuming on the affable censures of these depraved times. Ignorance can Apologize herselfe: for what Writer now a dayes weares not that Livery? To our History: These naturall Discourses of the qualities of Beasts, Birds, Serpents, and other Creatures, be likewise especially needefull for Divines: They may amply dilate upon the admirable Workes of their Creator, by the Survey of his Creatures. For even all Birds and Beasts (if exactly considered) shew the infinite  211 power of the Almighty; not onely in Creating,  212 but infusing such diversly-affected natures and dispositions in them. The witty Emblematist also draines his pretty inventions from these resemblances; portraying the Creature, and annexing his device to the Portray. Nay, they are very motive perswasions to the acknowledging of our owne weaknesse and infirmity: spurres to thankfulnesse, as that excellent Embleme, where a Larke was pearched, with these Verses: 213 Cantat Alauda Deo laudes gratissima Summo, Hinc nos ingratos grata lacescit avis. Englished thus. The early Larke her gratefull minde displayes, Descanting Morne by Morne her Makers praise: Whence she doth taxe such as unthankfull be, That have more cause, yet give lesse thanks than she. We have many such witty Emblemes, well befitting the most Christian understanding to contemplate; drawing the inscrutable Wisdome of God from the Excellency of his Creatures: the divers formes whereof generally varying, their different Natures in few things concurring, and their continuance so mainly discording, may minister to the greatest Atheist, no lesse cause of Admiration, than cause of Execration of his irreligious and damnable Opinion. 214 Nor can there be any Arguments more forcing than these, to bring a mis- beleever to the acknowledgment of his Maker. So as, the very Atheist, if he would suffer himselfe to be evinced by Reason, could not chuse but veile, and ingenuously hold himselfe condemned by Birds oth' Aire: Whose melody is ever mounting with airy Wings to that Supreme Majesty . Upon which consideration, would hee but reflect on  215 himselfe, he should soone finde, how miserable it is for man to be silent in Gods praise, when Birds become heavenly Quiristers in sending forth sweetayres. I cannot chuse but wonder at Democritus , who was of such various, nay, Omnifarious reading, as there was nothing in the whole frame or Workmanship of 216 Nature , wherein he did not shew himselfe a Writer. That Hee, who knew the Natures, differences of all Beasts, Plants, Fishes, Birds; and as some say, could understand the Tunes and Voyces of them, should so miserably erre in that, which hee should principally know. For if these Visible Creatures be Laymens Bookes; wherein they may finde matter enough to magnify the Power, Wisdome and Providence of God; much more those, who are Vers'd in Bookes, and are enabled to conferre Contemplation with Reading, merit high reproofe: who seeing what they may worthily admire; and that the Maker of them is Hee, to whom they are onely to adhere; are neither wonne by the One nor Other, to acknowledge the sole Omnipotency of their Creator. It is said of the Quaile , being the very same Bird which was the Isra elites Meate in the Wildernesse, that as hee flyes over the Sea, feeling himselfe to begin to be weary, he lights by the way into the Sea. Then lying at one side, hee layes downe one Wing upon the Water, and holds up the other Wing towards Heaven. Lest hee should presume to take too long a flight at the first, he wets one wing. Lest hee should despaire of taking a new flight afterwards, he keeps the other wing dry. The Morall is divine, though the Story be naturall and humane. Oculus ad Coelum, manus ad Clavum . The Course of our perillous Navigation in this our Sea-fare, toucheth upon two dangerous Shelves; such as threaten more inevitable ruine to the unwary Navigator, than those two Sicilian Gulfes, Scylla and Charybdis . Where Presumption , upon the confidence of her owne strength, falls by a precipitate Course into the depth of all misery: and despaire , through too much diffidence, lyes miserably groveling, neither seeking nor hoping for Remedy. The flight of the former is either short, or none at all; because Presumption makes her thinke it needlesse to fly for that of which shee is already seaz'd: and Despaire , like heavy chesses, retardates her flight; suggesting to her that it is needlesse to fly for that whereof shee can never possibly be seas'd. Oris Apollo writeth, that the Æ gyptians (amongst many other profound Hieroglyphicks) when they would describe the Heart , paint that Bird, which they call Ibis : because they thinke no Creature, for proportion of the body, hath so great an Heart as the Ibis hath. If the Pagans made such singular use in their dirrection of Birds; as they ever reduced whatsoever they read, or had seene in that kinde, to some excellent end: Much more wee, who know better the use of these Creatures, and to what proper end they were first ordained; not in Wantonnesse to abuse them, as those loose Imperiallists did, who affected nothing more then Rarity; nor desired ought more, then to surfeit in their Excesse and superfluity. Neyther in a Superstitious use of them; as the Pagans did, who attributed their good or bad fortune to such Birds, as were eyther Auspicious or Ominous: promising themselves  217 successe according to their flight; or inspection of their Intrals after death. In the time of Augustus , an Eagle hovering over the Heads of such Patricians , as were then in Consultation; at last setled upon the name of Agrippa , and just upon the first Letter of that name A \---A Lightning likewise descending downe from Heaven, stroke the first Letter of his owne name out,--- C \--- Whence South-sayers, by conjecturall Arguments, or Revelations from their Oracles, gathered, that Hee should but live an hundred dayes after, and be afterwards Cannonized for a God: because Æ sar , the residue of that Name in the Tuscane Language signified God. Albeit, some even amongst themselves, sleighted their Auguries, as might be instanced in Claudius Pulcher ; who, when in taking his Auspicia , or the predictious of his successe by the inspections of Birds, before Sicilie , the Pullets would not feed, hee commanded they should be plunged in the Sea, that they might drinke, seeing they would not eate. The like did Crassus , who being willed by the Arabian Guides, at such time as he was Marching within the Persian Frontiers, to make haste before the Moone was in Scorpio ; "but I (said he) feare more Sagittary , meaning the Archers of Persia. But there is nothing in my Opinion, that should worke more powerfull effects, or beget in men more virile shame, than to see them outstript by Creatures of this kind, even in arguments of Naturall Aflection and Humanity. 218 It is a notable Observation, which a Divine Father sometimes culled from a Naturall Historian: When the old Storke through Age becomes naked of Feathers, shee is fed by her Brood, and carryed by them from place to place upon their Wings. This might worthily strike a glowing shame in the breasts of all such unnaturall Children, who neglect their duties to their aged Parents; bringing their grey-haires with sorrow to their  219 Graves. For how should these in an equall proportion requite them from whom they had their being and breeding; admit they should for their reliefe, conferre all their Fortunes and livelyhood upon them? What should I say likewise of unnaturall Mothers; who scorne to impart their owne Breasts to their owne Babes? Can these see the Curuca with her attendance following, and nursing care hatching the Cuckowes egges, and not blush at themselves? Have they naked breasts to bestow on the ayre, or allure a wandring eye, and must their owne be deprived of that liberty? Many such Morall Motives as these, speake to us in the natures of Birds: but I must not dwell on these; but hasten in this my Historical Survey , to the native discovery of other Creatures. Here the Hyene (as Pliny relates) can imitate  220 the voice of any Man, and that so neerely, as his voyce can hardly be distinguished from the voyce of him he imitateth; taking his denomination from the Greekes , according to his naturall rapine. There the Fiber , or Rever (by what instinct, Humane wisdome could never reach to) to satisfie his covetous pursuer, bites off his own stones, being the prize (he knowes) for which he is pursued. Here see the dissembling Sphinx , able to personate any passion, eyther of joy or sorrow. There the wonderfull nature of the Rhynoceros : The Lyon so naturally valiant, as not to be daunted; yet behold the silly Cocke can make him tremble! Then represent to your generous reading, the naturall enmity betwixt the Horse and the Beare , the Wolfe and the Lyon , the Fox and the Badger ; such a native disagreeing remaines among these Beasts, as their hatred is implacable; ever pursuing their enemy with an inveterate hate: for an enmity ingrafted by nature, cannot be suppressed by lesse then nature. Many conflicts were instituted in Rome (at solemnization of any Festivall, or in remembrance of some memorable Exploit atchieved) betwixt Beasts: whence the Romans gathered great knowledge, seeing the remisnesse of some Natures, and the eagernesse of others. Some of an unquailed spirit, yet in strength unable to maintaine their spirit: others (like our unweldy Epicures) sinewy and fleshy enough, have strength at will, but defect of courage so curbes them, as the over-flow of ability waines in the rising; not daring to encounter with one of lesse strength, but more vivacity. 221 When Fabius Maximus went in Embassage to Pyrrhus , Prince of Epyre , with whom (at that time) the Romans had Warre: hee denounced open Hostility against him and his Territories, for not performing some conditions included in the League. Pyrrhus , to terrifie Fabius , commanded his Guard to place an Elephant behind the Arras, that at their next parley, Fabius seeing so 222 terrible a Beast, might of his owne accord solicite Peace. But Fabius (though one at that time unacquainted with such sights, for never were any Elephants then seene in Rome ) hearing him send out his hollow voice, replyed: The sound of 223 a Roman Ramme will be more terrible than the voyce of an Epyrian Elephant. But these grew afterward to publick Spectacles: so as in any Triumph 224 of some victorious, or puissant Captaine, there were many Elephants, Ounces, Panthers, Tygers , and other savage Beasts slaine, offering them (in Triumphant manner) to the Temple of the Goddesse Victoria. Varro , a Roman Peere, one to whom the Romane Tongue was much indebted, did illustrate the  225 Annals of Rome with their Ceremoniall Triumphs; shewing also what Beasts were wont to be sacrificed to the Gods, and for what cause that Institution was observed; If the Victory (sayth he) was purchased with the losse of blood, they used to sacrifice to Mars , a Cocke ; but if without blood, they offered an Oxe. These naturall Descriptions of Beasts are very delightfull to the generous Reader; they are very fit for illustrating any Subject; making comparison betwixt the Natures of Beasts, Birds, or Plants, and other materiall subjects of our Discourse; comparing Lust, Incest, and such lascivious exorbitances to the Lapwing , represented by Tereus , the Ravisher of Philomel : Inferring by the Spider , Arrogancy, or Pride, that durst compare with Pallas for pre eminency. By the Cormorant , grating Oppression, sencelesse and remorcelesse of others Miseries. Progne (in a Swallowes habit) implying the swiftnesse of revenge to Murder. That chaste Bird Porphyrio , who, as he is constant in his choice, so if hee see his love abused, his nest defiled, he dyes through griefe; as one impatient of such disgrace. Hee is sayd likewise to bite the Water, implying, that as hee is pure of himselfe, so hee cannot endure to partake of those streames, which are troubled or soyled with any brackish distemper. We read how Phineus that impious Arcadian 226 Prince, having by the perswasion of his second wife Id aea , put out his Childrens eyes, which he had by his first wife Cleopatra , was for this unnaturall fact plagued of the Harpyes : three monstruous and ravenous Birds, Æ lo, Ocypete , and Celano , having Maiden visages. Long time was this unhappy King annoyed, what way soever he Travailed: Sea could not secure him, nor Land priviledge him. At his repast, his stomack was made queasie by their stench: and on the night time, by reason of their noise, was he reft of rest: In which story, sundry excellent Morals are daintily couched. First, how the very Ethnitke Po ets could invent punishments for haynous delinquents. O qu am merito divina occurrit ultio cuiusque peccati proprio obiecto ! A commanding Prince, if conscious of blood, cannot find himselfe a shroud. No shelter against Murder. Flie he to the Sea, the very waves raised by the fury of the winds, will be his remembrancers; retire he to the Land, the very Creatures will have him in pursuite, till they become his Surprizers. From his House he flyes unto the field, but Furies dogge him still: no Covert in field can rescue him from his Fate. By the Harpyes , may be understood, that there is no Creature, but the Supreame power , if Hee please, can make it his Avenger. But these kind of Birds were by the Po ets most properly devised to be pursuers of this bloody Prince. Their ravenous Nature agreed best with his temper. For as their Condition is to prey upon their owne; so did hee in his cruelty seaze upon his owne: And as the Eye is the first part which any revenous Bird useth to pick at: so it was the Eyes of these Orphan-children which their Step-dame Id aea aym'd at. Now, whereas these Birds are portrayed with Maiden-visages, we may by that safely conclude, Frontis nulla fides \---: Amiable Features may have savage Natures. Those Sirens had beautifull Faces, cheerefull Voyces, but dangerous Greetings. There is more belonging to a sincere heart than a promising presence. As the stillest Waters are the deepest; so fairest Faces wound the deadliest. They are apt to allure; and happy is that wise Ithacus , that can stop his Eye and Eare. These came to Phineus Table like beauteous Guests, but pursu'd him like hideous Ghosts. Beauty is a taking baite, it can cover Treason with a smile; but being swallowed, it becomes the Takers baine. But now see how this calamitous Prince receives reliefe, when his miseries crowded thickest: and how these intrusive Guests are expulsed, when his hopes were in despaire, and from expectance of reliefe remotest! Cala is , that valiant Sonne of Boreas by Orithia , who with Zethes having Wings, to accelerate their journey, flew to Colchis to helpe the Argonauts : and being in that voyage courteously used of King Phineus , they in recompence drave out of his Countrey those ravening Birds called Harpyes. Nor wants this Comicall passage his Morall: for hence may we gather, what benefit redounds to such as are hospitable. How those, whom they sometimes harboured for Strangers, become in time of danger their deliverers. This might be confirmed by Holy Writ; where Angels were received in habit of Strangers: and what succour they ministred to their Harbourers. Such as these usefully applyed, will afford infinite profit to the Reader: so as, hee may delightfully enlarge himselfe by way of Discourse to any intelligible Hearer. There be other Birds, who reteine in them an ancient naturall hatred to Beasts, from whom they conceive themselves to have received wrong; and this their hatred is implacable even to death. 227 The Cowshot or Stock-dove cannot endure the Heyfer for that old injury shee suffered before she chang'd her Nest: so as now with an insulting jeere, which she still redoubles in her Note, shee seemingly challengeth her to come unto her: being confident that her Seate is mounted farre above her hate; so as, shee may now securely domineere, when her airy Nest pleads priviledge against all feare. Æ githus , in proportion a little Bird, yet of a strong and stout spirit; being at deadly hatred with the Asse; for that hee destroyeth her Nest, which for the most part shee builds among the Thistles : in revenge whereof, shee continually vexeth him (so apprehensive is the least Creature of an injury, and so quicke-sighted in conceiving where shee may requite her injury) by pecking him on gall'd places of his body. This Morall may seeme to glance at such ignoble spirits, who, so they may revenge, or expresse the heate of their fury; will not sticke to exercise it upon the poorest and contemptiblest Creatures: yea, they will pick an offence before it be offered: and play upon their simplicity, by whom they were never much injuried. These will ever leape over the hedge where it is lowest, and make such the prey of their fury, whom they finde most incapable of revenge, or unable to second what their reputation injoynes them to attempt. The like may be said of the Apiaster or Mudwall ; a Bird that beares inveterate hate to the painefull Bee and her Labours. In whose Nature the quality of such persons is covertly shadowed: who, Margites -like, doe no good themselves, but in a profuse Riot consume their fruitlesse Dayes, feeding their Surfeits with others imployments. In many Frontier-bordering Townes wee shall see this made good by wofull experience. While such industrious people, who, to use the words of Sententious Salust, Sedem Anima in extremis digitis habent ; placing their Soules in their Fingers ends, become a booty to the violence and incursion of their Neighbouring Drones; who seaze with strong hand (under pretence of an unsetled peace or expired League) upon whatsoever their industrious course of living had for divers yeeres deservingly gained and gathered. There is another sweet-sented Bird, called the Cinnamolge ; one who will build her Nest in no other Wood than Cinnamon . Her onely ambition is a dainty Seat; very singular in her consort with other Birds; pleasing to few but to herselfe: and if at any time shee deigne the Forrest that grace as to partake of her melody, Nightingal-like Dat sine mente sonum \--- 228 A neare Resemblance (as if sprung from one Stemme) may this sweet-breath'd Bird seeme to have to our Court-Popinjay; whose sense most commonly consists in sent . His Action or Gesture is nothing but Cringes; his Breath an Ayry Complement; his Rinde (to make this Cinnamon-Similitude more full) worth all his body beside. When Iupiter and Iuno's Wedding was solemnized of old, to make the Solemnity more compleat; the Gods were all invited to the Feast, and many Noble-men besides. Amongst the rest came Crysalus a Persian Prince, bravely attended, rarely accoutred, rich in Golden Attires, in gay Robes, with a Majesticall Presence, a formall posture, a portly Encounter, but otherwise an Asse. The Gods seeing him come in such pompe and state, rose up to give him place, Ex habitu hominem metientes ; But Iupiter perceiving what hee was, a light, phantastick, idle fellow, turned him and his proud followers into Butterflies: And so they continue still (for ought I know to the contrary, if the Fiction hold with Verity) roving about in pied Coats, and are called Chrysalides by the wiser sort of men; that is, Golden out-sides, Drones, Flies, and things of no worth. For the truth  229 of the Fable, we will not stand much on it; but what the Poets intended by these Transformations, may be easily gathered. These Silken Gulls, who are onely to be valued by what they weare , not what they are , in this very Morall receive their Censure. They prease into the highest places; converse with Eminent'st persons; thrust themselves upon greatest businesse: but fall off still with some palpable disgrace to themselves. They are not intus fimbriati , and therefore must be Deorum consilijs ablegati . Those who had no Sage in their Pates, were not held fit to be at Councell-Table with the Gods. There is another Morall too which ariseth naturally from that Cinnamon-nested Bird; and without much Criticisme might be applyed to a  230 Pen-feathred Citizen; who having now (as hee thinks) sufficient wealth, h'as shut up Shop, and bid adue to his Trade. And as one who had taken a surfeit of the City, has built himselfe a new Fishers folly in the Countrey. Nothing but Perspective Glasse, Porphyrite Pillars, Thracian Touch, and Arabian perfumes in every roome. Nothing but Beauty reflects in every corner, except the face of the Owner. Oh, how hee is taken with the delight of his Seate! The exquisite device of his Building! His None-such must be admired by such as see it, or hee holds himselfe infinitely wronged. So hee may have his Dwelling-house neately trimmed, and the house of his Body curiously cockred, he thinks nothing can goe amisse, all things are well ordered. 231 Meane-time, hee little remembers Petrarchs Counsell; who adviseth him "not to be affraid, though the House of his Body be shaken, so his Soule, the Guest of his Body, fare well. Many other excellent Moralls might be from this onely Bird extracted, but brevity, the best helpe to memory, makes me omit them. I could here inlarge my Discourse in relating  232 the wonderfull Concord of divers Birds among themselves; as the constant League or Amity of Crowes , who are ever observed to take one part; the naturall love of Stares : and generally, how Birds of one feather flock together, and are ready to doe mutuall offices one to another. But our Naturall Historians, who have amply writt of this Subject, can sufficiently supply the Reader in this way; to whom I referre them. I will onely here resolve one question which may be demanded, and it is this: What should the reason be, why all Birds by an in-bred hate pursue the Hawke; and though they cannot annoy him, yet will they flicker about him; desiring nothing  233 more, if their powers were to their wills, than to surprize him? But the Po et h'as a reply ready in the persons of those Birds, which may fully affoile this question: Wee hate the Hauke because of all that are 234 Expos'd to prey, hee ever lives in warre. For the Owle or Batte , or all such Night-birds, why they are so had in pursuit, if it chance they  235 come abroad upon day-time, this reason may be given. As they are unsociable and estrange themselves from their company, having onely the priviledge of night, and the Ivy or some other retired shrowd for their Sanctuary; so they are hooted at by other Birds for their singularity, or for their neglect of civill Society. In the Beasts of the Forrest this may likewise be observed: the Lyon (a fierce beast) of an Hero icke Nature, contemning the dejected ones, nor caring to feed on Carrion. Hee is of a Majesticke disposition, and hates to be ungratefull for the least benefits received: If the Mouse rid him of base servitude, he will finde time to requite her love one way or other. This may represent the person of a King (for indeede hee is the King of Beasts) who scornes to triumph over the subjected, but to tyrannise over the proud. The Elephant resembles a man prest downe  236 with honour; being once downe, he cannot rise: he is like some great man, who puffed up with the prosperous gales of his fortunes, can finde no knees of allegiance, or submission to either Prince or State; his joynts are inflexible, and the load of his honour insupportable: once downe, impossible to rise, but by some un-usuall occurrent. What strange effects of Nature this creature reteineth, may be instanced in this notable story. It is reported by Philippo Pigafetta , a Traveller of approved credit, that hee had seene with his owne eyes a very strange and admirable thing in Coanza , namely, that a young Elephant following his Damme, fell downe by chance into one of those Pit-falls, purposely made by Hunters, to surprise them: and after she could not with all her skill and strength draw him out of it, she buried him therein, and covered him with earth, with branches, and with bowes, insomuch as she filled the Pit up to the top, to the end that the Hunters should not enjoy her Calfe; choosing rather to kill it her selfe (with this affectionate kind of interment) than to leave it to the mercy of the cruell Hunts-men. The Wolfe (a State-gormandizer) preyes upon the innocent, suckes the blood of the Orphane, impaires others meanes to enlarge his owne: cruelty is the habiliment he best liketh, making the State a wilde Forrest for every Savage to live in, but a Shambles for the poore silly Lambkin to suffer in. The Goate , your wanton and sensuall Amorist, that skips here and there, in every brake of vanity, till so entwined, as the sale of his reputation makes him beg for a good name: but the eyes of Generall Observance are not so dazelled, they have seene his heart, and registred his follies. The Beare , one that portends by his Birth,  237 what he will be: an unhandsome peece of flesh, one that needs licking before hee be brought to fashion: Here's Natures deformity, charactring by the foulnesse of the body, the filthinesse of his disposition. Tyrants wee have had of this Resemblance, who came the wrong way into the world, to intimate what wrongs they would doe unto the world. But now of tamer Creatures. The Lambe cannot drinke of a troubled Spring,  238 no more can Innocence. The Hare ever sleeps with open eyes: so doth good Providence. The Coney is fruitfull and fearefull: So is Nuptiall Chastity. The Emmet is in Summer ever fore-seeing a Winter: Such is good Husbandry. Shall wee proceed in Birds likewise, and examine their Natures? The Turtle for Constancy: The Crane for Vigilancy: The Robin expresseth his love to Man: the Nightingall to Women. None more industrious than the Larke , More laborious than the Wren : more odious to her selfe, and others, than the Cuckow : More Hero ick than the Eagle : More base than the Buzzard. Then observe what secret instincts given to certaine Birds, to prognosticate the events of things. The Crow , a fore-teller of what Weather will come to passe. The Halcyon or Seamaw , remarkable in prediction of Stormes: and the Swallow, 239 Crane  , and many others, exact observers of Seasons. It is strange, what is observed by the naturall Historian, of the Eagle and Raven ; the one, saith he, knowes when the Carkasse or Carrion shall fall, the other where . Which conceit, howsoever it may be many times erring, yet we shall  240 ever find the Raven first seazed on his prey, whensoever any such shall casually fall. We may observe likewise, diverse Birds who change their note or voice according to the disposition of the weather. Sometimes by their bathing, billing, or such like signes, may be naturally gathered infallible notions of the change and various disposition of weathers. It is sayd of the Bird Icterus , or as Pliny calls  241 her Galgulus , if any man that is sick of the yellow Jandise shall see her, the man shall waxe whole, recover his strength and colour, and by degrees  242 regaine his former vigour, but the Bird shall dye. Some have holden this Bird to be one of the certainest diviners of Weathers, of all others; whence the Po et: 243 Birds of the Ayre their prophesies retaine, The Pick'tree boads a storme, the Icterus raine. Diverse of our Navigators likewise observe, when they are on Sea, sundry incident alterations by the noise of Sea-fowles: and are cautioned by them to make speed for Land, lest a tempest endanger their passage. Of which sort, there are Some, who leave the Sea against a storme, and flye to Firme Land; remaining there till an Halcyon calme invite them to returne. There are incredible things reported of the Spinturnix ; a Bird that wont to come to the Altars, where they were sacrificing, and carry away a burning coale as a token of ill lucke, or burning to the house where it alighted. But these Relations are with more strength of Opinion, then probability or reason confirmed. Howsoever, no doubt but diverse Birds by a secret instinct of nature (the reason whereof to us is occult) can prenuntiate the Seasons and dispositions of weathers; which may appeare by Holy Writ; that Lydian-stone which can best trie the verity of all Humane assertions. The Swallow and Crane know their seasons . So as, even that Prophet, who sometimes admonished the people, not to be affraid for the signes of 244 Heaven , hath admitted these conjectural tokens. For the creatures of Heaven and Earth, as they were first ordained for our use; so by our right use of them, we may improve our own Knowledge; by making every Creature, a judiciall Epitome of Nature: ever closing with a free and humble acknowledgement of his uncircumscribed Power, by whom they were created; and of whose goodnesse it is that they may in their severall natures redound to our benefit, being well imployd. When a certaine religious Brother, who had bestowed much precious time on Contemplation;  245 and by meanes of a retyred life, to the end secular cares might lesse intangle him, had attained to such a measure of perfection that way, as he eyed nothing whereof he made not some Divine use; professed one day to One of the same Convent ; "That he could never see any Thing, the sight whereof did not in some manner edifie him. Oh, sayd the other, spare a little, good brother; pray you tell me, wherein can the sight of a Toade edifie you? Oh very much, quoth he; for what have I deserved that God should make me a Man and not a Toade? So that, as often as I see a Toade, so often do I recall this benefit to mind: rendring all due thankes to him, who according to my desert hath not formed me like any such detestable Creature, but hath bestowed on me the most beautifull and royall image of my Maker. Surely, as I have formerly observed, if our hearts were rightly disposed, by making good use of whatsoever in this inferiour Orbe wee see here created, and as proper Objects to our eies presented; we should easily confesse, that there is no Creature so small, vile or despicable, which might not be reduced to some image or Embleme of our Life; seeing, there is none, be it never so poore nor contemptible, which presents not in it selfe the goodnes of God. "And so by consideration had of these Temporal and External benefits (to use the words of a Divine Father) to gather the greatnesse and immensity of the heavenly counsell.  246 Neyther are these Moral applications of Birds  247 and the like, whereon, upon occasion, we have so amply insisted, to be conceived as uselesse. We shall find the Store-house of all Divine learning, that Sacred untroubled Fountaine of heavenly Knowledge, furnished with Morall similitudes and illustrations of this kind. As the Partrich, 248 (sayth the Prophet) gathereth the young, which she hath not brought forth: so hee that getteth Riches, and not by Right, shall leave them in the midst of his dayes, and at his end shall be a foole. Sometimes we shall find the tender-hearted Pellican named; the Turtle , and her affection described; the obsequious Storke commended; the Sparrow upon the house-top expressed. Sometimes Fowles addicted to prey, displayed. From which, we may gather excellent matter, not only of magnifying Him by whom they were created, and to their severall offices designed: but even in Humane discourse, we shall find many occasions of inlarging our selves; by application of the nature and disposition of them. So as, whosoever shall make an usefull observation of these feathred Fowles in the ayre, may find much more dainty Phylosophy in them, than in these tame Fooles who pride themselves in their feathred vanities on earth. Other Birds there be that have more humane feeling: Pliny reports, that there bee certaine Birds which howle exceedingly at the Eclypse of the Sunne; as if naturally moved by some miraculous influence or instinct from heaven, to suffer with a Divine body, so extreamly suffering: Let us descend to Wormes, Serpents, and Creeping things, we shall see in them distinct qualities also. 249 The Serpent Pareas creepeth on his Taile, and with the sharpnesse of his Belly makes a furrow upon the ground where he crawleth. Strange things be reported of the Serpent Seraphis ,  250 adored by the Æ gyptians as a God: Others there there be no lesse different in nature, forme, nourishment, and feature: Some feeding upon raw flesh, intimating their ravenous Natures: Others  251 on fish (as divers Serpents) living upon the Banke of the River Nilus : Others on plants, and the fruit of Trees, which Plautus expresseth by the Vine-fretter: Matura Vitis folia Involvolus carpit. But other creeping creatures there be very beneficiall  252 to Humane society. The Silkeworme , whose labours make our silken Gallants. To that excesse are we come, as our bravery must be maintained by the diligence of the simplest creatures, cloathing our selves with the very bowels of Wormes: Wonderfull is their Generation. 253 The Adder in her selfe obnoxious and hurtfull, yet she casts her skinne (to expresse her good meaning to man) an excellent cure to many diseases. The poore Worme, of her selfe, neither greatly harmefull nor profitable, onely (by a Synonomy betwixt Man and Her) she is the best Mirrour of humane Glory, an Embleme of our Mortality: and an importunate Guest that will come to banquet on our bodies, though not invited: She is called Vermis (quasi inermis ) she can but turne againe, that's all the defensive, or offensive weapon she hath ready. These silly contemptible creatures be especiall  254 Motives to a good man, of Thankfulnesse: the example we read in that devout Father Anselme ; who walking one day in his garden, and seeing a poore Worme crawling under his feete, presently applyed this Christian-like use to himselfe. O Lord, thou mightest have made mee like 255 this Worme, contemptible and base, to live in the holes and cavernes of the earth; But such was thy mercy, as thou wouldest not: bestowing on me thine owne Image, that thy similitude might be 256 glorified in mee . A comfortable meditation of a zealous Father, and worthy our observation. We will now discourse of the skaly Fishes in their kind, that the Majesty and power of God (by giving such diversity of Natures to Fishes) may appeare in the Depths, as before it was manifestly expressed upon the earth, and all dry places. Here is a Tyrannicke power even in the Ocean, and an absolute government without restraint of power: Here is a Musicall concordancy likewise; a Diapason of Sea- inhabitants. The Dolphin playing a soft straine, resembling a  257 Meane: the Sturgeon (swimming against the Streame) sharpens her Note, more neare a Treble: the Iulis a smooth Counter-tenor, and the rowling Porpoise the Base. 258 Here is great enmity (likewise) for predominancy: And that amongst the greatest, the Orcke with the Whale : The Cuttell with the Th ornebacke ; the Sea-horse with the Sea-vrchin : Many rare vertues in little creatures: with what strangenesse the Remora (a fish of small bignesse) holds a Shippe, when in her full Saile? How wonderfully the Torpedo delivers her-selfe, being taken by the unhappy Fisher? disgorging her owne bowels, to stupefie the Taker with an uncoth amazement. 259 Againe, to observe the ravenous disposition of the Pike ; the sociable condition of the Trout ; the various discolouring of the Polypus ; the strong digestion of the Porpoise : would beget in these curious Surveyors of nature, much admiration. And then to compare the natures of these water- inhabitants with our selves, who follow, for most part, the bent of our desires, as if we were estranged from that beauty which incomparably most adornes us; and drenched in the leas of our owne corruptions, which makes man most unlike himselfe; by idolatrizing that which gives the greatest blemish to his Excellence. Emblemes are devices no lesse usefull then delightfull, to present Man best to himselfe; and to taxe him too by way of shadowing, what (perchance) he would be loath to endure in a freer manner of expression. For tell me, how should any of our Grand-oppressours , who make their Inferiours their Sponges : fatning themselves with violence; and spinning to themselves an estate out of others bowels: how should these, I say, read of the ravenous disposition of the Pike , and not reflect upon themselves? They find his nature to be such, that all is fish that comes to his net. He admits no dispensation; if his power may surprize him; he becomes his prey. Affinity, Consanguinity, all respects of civil Society must be excluded: his wil is his Law ; and he must suffer that dare oppose it. This might strike a glowing blush in our hunting Nimrods ; who, so they may seaze on their prey, and make innocence the object of their fury; neyther care for Heaven nor Hell. Judgements cannot startle them; because they are yet insensible of them. Compassion cannot supple them; for that is such a stranger, as of all other Pilgrims they never gave her harbour. Nay, humanity beares so little sway with them; as they scorne to incline to ought that may civilize them. It is sayd, that Pictures convey deepest impressures; and that many have blushed in the perusall of some Emblemes, by eying in them their owne natures. I could wish that these, who have ingaged themselves to oppression, and made injury their Darling, to looke upon the Lucius : who takes his name from his quick-discerning sight; but imployes it to an indirect end. They shall finde themselves charactred in his Life: and read such qualities in him, as Humanity cannot chuse but loath. That cautious Impresse about his Embleme may serve too for an usefull direction: " Id facere laus est, quod decet, non quod licet. Then to note that sociable Affability of the Trout , cannot but beget singular effects in sweete and well-tempered dispositions. This may be an Embleme to all such who affect nothing more than Concord: Litigious Suiters, who cramme Seates of Judicature with fat fees: who will doe no right, nor take wrong; who feed themselves with Contention; and have ever an Oare in that Boat which is imbarked in Waters of Division; are all Antipodes to this Embleme. Marcus C aelius was said to have a good right hand, but an ill left hand, because he could plead against a man better than for him. But these are no such Agents: These will either doe good, or doe nothing. As they affect peace; so every particular action of theirs merits praise. These desire not to swell great, by the Consumption of Others: nor disperse their well-grounded Fame on a disadvantageous Warre: They ever reteine their place, and impale it with this Impresse of Peace: " Pax una Triumph is innumeris potior \--- Then goe to your Machiavell Statist, that changeable-colour'd Polypus . One, who can walke in a Cloud; and disguise dangerous plots with vertuous pretences. Here you shall finde nothing unliker a mans selfe than himselfe. He flies with the Lapwing , farre from his Nest, that he might be more secure: and more easie it were to finde that incredible Stone in the Lapwings Nest, than to retrive the secrecy of his Aymes. Though the Polypefish be various in Colours; and in nothing more mutable than her owne Feature: This politick Masker can vye with him in various projects: being such a faithfull Secretary to himselfe, as he scornes to have any his Intelligencer: or to discover himselfe otherwise to the World, than by pretending what is the least of his meaning. And now he is come to that height of perfection, (if wee may safely bestow such a Title on dissembling) as he is jealous of Others trust: nor dare scarcely beleeve himselfe, while hee conserres privately with his owne Breast. In a word, so unequally paraleld is his outward disguise, and inward conceit, as his Dislembling h'as begot in him, and deriv'd to us this impressive Caution: \---" Quodnones, ne videare cave. Now, for the strong-digesting Porpoise : that naturall Description (for it shadows not onely the outward Constitution) implies the quality' of such persons; as can connive at injuries received: can suffer with an equall temper, whatsoever the iniquity of Time, or inclemency of Fate shall or may inflict. Others, while they exclaime against Destiny,  & teare the Clouds with no lesse fruitlesse than godlesse Imprecations: These with a resolved silence, and habituate patience, can digest all indignities: laugh at the Braves of Fortune: and with a composed spirit crowne their Sufferings with this expression: " Patior potiorq vicissim. The Acipenser , or which Pliny calls, Sacer piscis , feeds on nothing but Mans flesh, implying a caveat to Man: that having so many Enemies even on Earth, and not free from them in the Depth, should not spend his time in security, but prevent the enmity of all creatures by a diligent and vigilant care to himselfe. Long could I protract this discourse, but two materiall parts of this Relation with-hold me from insisting longer: The first whereof first offering themselves, be Plants and Vegetative Bodies. 260 The wisest of all Kings was much conversant in these Studies, knowing every Tree, every Hearbe, and every flower: a Cedro Libanon, usq ad Hysopum supra parietem : An excellent Commendation in a King; not addicting his minde to other things than the purchase of Knowledge, even in inferiour things: that a generality of knowing, might make him worthy of governing. Probus the Roman Emperour, who succeeded Florianus in the Empire, was much addicted to Planting, and distinguishing the Natures of Flowers, the vertues of Plants, with proper observances accommodated for the knowledge of all Seasons, apt for Grafting, Stilling, and the like: Planting the Mountaine Almus sited neare Syrmius , and the Mount Aureus in M aesia the Higher, with Vines. The like we read of Galerius Maximinus , Surnamed Armentarius ; and many others of the Romans , whose diligence was much imployed in such pleasant affaires. Resemblances in these vegetative Bodies, require  261 observance; to see the Vine like a fruitfull Mother of many faire Children, sending out her ripened clusters, faire blossoming Sprigs, and infinite store of pretty Slippes, imitating their Mothers fruitfulnesse, and bending with her owne Burden, as not able to support her selfe without some stay or upholder: The pittifull Elme stretcheth her armes out to beare her up, in pure compassion moved to helpe her, that in her selfe and fruitfull Issue, was so helpfull unto others. Whence, some have resembled the Vine and the Elme to the Church and Commonweale ; whose office it is to support the Church when distressed, as the Elme succours the Vine when surcharged. The Vine seemes sometime to weepe (for teares indeed shee sheds) as if in Throwes and paine of her Labour: These teares distilling from the Vine cure the Leprosie: So as she seemes both  262 Fruitfull and Soveraigne, yeelding no lesse comfort in her teares, than verdure in her sprayes. Many of these teare-shedding Trees there be,  263 as the Myrrh -dropping Amber , and the Rosined Fyrrh : These by allusion may seeme to commiserate our unhappy states, subjected to myriads of anxieties, by the taste of one Tree, whose dismall fruit made us wretched. Some Trees we have for harbour and shadow onely, resembling our dissembling professours; whose externall appearance makes great show of a fruitfull inside, when nothing, save a meere naked pretence of Piety, remaines in them. Others for fruit, without any store of blossomes; and such be they as desire rather to be good, than so accounted. 264 Some Trees pine away, as if surprized with an amorous passion, exemplified in the Boxe: Others shew by their freshnesse, to whom they are consecrate, as the Myrtle. Some lose not their colour in Winter, like the patient man, who beleagred with the worst of fortunes oppositions, never changeth countenance for the matter; but like that Venetian Motto writ in Triumph: Nec fluctu nec flatu movetur .  265 Others not subject to any hurt by thunder, as the Bayes: resemble the sincere conscience, not discomfitted with any assault, or dismayed with any terrour. Sweet Odours, Flowers, and all other Beauties strowed upon this artificiall Carpet, garnish the earth, as the internal vertues inhabiting the mind, doe the Soule: This discourse more concerning the Herbist, than Historian, makes me more briefe in the handling hereof. 266 Yet in regard of that precious resemblance which they reteine (as all our Moralists have well observed) to our inward beauty, I chuse the rather to insist a little ampler of them, by an apt comparison or paralell betwixt them and such dispositions as they resemble. For the greatest benefit that may any way redound to man, is seriously to read man: and in the Survey of inferiour Creatures,  267 to collect wherein any of these may seeme to read a Lecture to Man; wherein soever he comes either short or over of what is required of him. This that wise Democritus observed in the diffection of his Anatomies: and this should wee in our very Walkes and Recreations abroad usually practice: so may the application of them to our selves, infinitely improve us. In our tracing and traversing the Forrest; wee shall there finde some Trees for shade, but barren  268 of fruite: Others lesse usefull for shade, but plenteous in fruit. Our Sanctimonious-seeming Non-Conformatist reteines an apparant resemblance of the one: our Sincere Professour of the other. A goodly beauteous Shadow to delude vulgar eyes, sufficeth the former: but shadowes are reduc'd to substantiall fruites by the latter. These Historicall Relations may (likewise) point at painted friendshippe. Where many, in their Airy professions will not stick to promise golden Mountaines: but their performance (the essentiall fruite or effect of promise) dyes alwayes in the Socket; the snuffe of that vaporous Complement expires and dyes. Friendship (sayth the Stagyrian ) is one soule which ruleth two hearts ; and one heart which dwelleth in two bodies . Hearts then must not be ruled by shadowes. Congies, Cringes, Curtsies and Formalities may delude, and imparadize an unexperienc'd Novice: These, I say, may transport our youngling, who never knew what dissembling meant: nor could ever yet distinguish betwixt fruite and shade, Essence and Semblance: but those, who are experimentally vers'd in the World, easily decline from such Snares. For Circumspection hath taught them such a Lesson, as they have learned to season Amity with Salt: and introduce acquaintance by experience; least their too easie intimacy beget repentance. Plutarch reporteth that Plato came forth of Asia into Cilicia for no other cause but only to see his deare friend Phocion the Philosopher. Such a visit begot an amicable benefit, a Philosophicall improvement. These enterviewes were not like that of Alcm aeons to Cr aesus : his regreet was to receive gold: a sordid ayme! when Vertue is the prize which should onely be in chace. Guilded shadowes merit approvement, but by whom? By Fooles of the Time. But no true amity can be derived from these; no more then fruits from shadowes. This resemblance then holds to life, both in flower and fruit. 269 A Iuniper tree maketh the hotest coale, and the coolest shadow of any Tree. The coale is so hot, that if it be rak't up in ashes of the same, it  270 continueth unextinguished by the space of a whole yeare. Here is the Embleme of an incomparable disposition; here is both heate to refresh an afflicted  271 friend, when with adversity benummed: and shadow to solace him, when with the grandeur of businesse surcharged. Here is warmth to allay cold: and coolenesse too, to attemper heate. Peter Martyr sheweth, that cloathing doth keep the body warme two wayes: by keeping in the natural heat of the body: and by keeping out the accidentall cold of the aire. Sure I am, such a friendship as is here described, and by the sweet-sented Embleme of the Iuniper , shadowed, may be for all seasons equally accommodated: an excellent garment, being fitted both for Cover and Ornament. Now the Sycamore is of an other nature: though it afford a spreading shade, it reteines no such native heat: it delights the eye, but relisheth not the taste. And this discovers our large professing friends in Folio ; who are ample enough in protests: but all they bestow upon us in the end, are but scattred Leafes: they are rich in shade, but rare in fruit. Who can passe by the Winter-flourishing Cypresse , but must paralell that Tree with an Hero icke resemblance? Cupressus nobilis Emblema militis. Fates nor Furies cannot amate him: no enemy so powerfull, nor danger so mortall, as can detract from his Spirit; or weaken his courage. He hates no Fury more then feare: nor entertaines ought with a more resolved temper, then the extreamest oppositions of fortune; holding it the highest degree of happinesse to expire with honour. I could here inlarge this Discourse with sundry instances of this kind: but I must leape from this branch, and descend to a subject lower in respect of site: but nothing inferiour in delight: being commodiously applied, as it is compendiously compiled. 272 For Stones, and all kinds of Minerals, it is a knowledge worthy Gentlemen: wherein I may likewise comprehend the ancient knowledge of Coines, in what Emperours time, and their severall inscriptions. We read how Iulius C aesar came into Brittany 273 in hope to finde Pearles; though Caligula's trafficke seemed lesse worthy, commanding his Souldiers to gather Cockle-shels. It is a very generous quality (and sometimes he shall be put to his judgement) to distinguish rightly and exactly of Saphires, Emeralds, Diamonds, &c. This requires exact judgement, lustres may be given to Glasse, as well as Diamonds: Adulterate Gemmes passe current with our Novice: The Silver-Smiths of Ephesus have instructed this Age sufficiently, and fraud must be incorporate to every Profession. If these Gems, I talke of, were ornaments of the Mind; I should desire longer to insist upon them: but being (as these times use them) rather foments to ensnare and entrappe, than attractive motives to affect, according to their Native properties, being ordained as resemblances of vertues; I will not dilate of their values, but only of their power, more pertinent to my Discourse, and better according with my knowledge; who Æ schylus -like, have long time drawne Water out of anothers Cesterne, but never filled mine owne Bucket. Many excellent vertues of Stones, doth Pliny 274 in his Naturall History set downe unto us: As some have power to frustrate the effect of poison: Others very powerfull against the operations of Magick Spels, Witch-craft, and the like. But as a Judicious Commentary writes of him: Multa scribit, qu ae mehercule vera non existimanda sunt : Yet to stand in suspence with us (for the reverence of such a learned Author) because their effects have not beene as yet tryed of us. Many things (I confesse) seeme by all probability like the Amalga , to have more Moone than Sunne in them: But the experiments which wee have in some, makes us more credulous in others. The Diamond (whose Character is not to bee razed) resembles the pure impressions of vertue  275 we have received, and which is traduced to us, by the intellectuall eye of the soule, which in no case should be razed or abolished in us, but to be augmented with a greater increase of vertues: It resembles also the truely Charitable  276 man, that to doe good to others, impaires his owne fortunes For the best Motto that ever was made of the Diamond , was this: Dum formo, minuo. 277 The stone Mithax (saith Pliny ) is of a perfect colour, till opposed to the Sunne, and then it loseth his colour: It alludeth to many of our painted Sepulchers, our She-puppets: none more cleare, or amiably-coloured then they, till the Sunne glitter on them, and their slightly-laid-on varnish, presently then dissolveth: Quantum mutatur ab illa ? True Sodoms Apples, no sooner touched, then to dust and corruption turned. Topaz , her opposite (in Native vertue) shineth most in the thickest darknesse: The very Id aea of Vertue her selfe: The Clouds cannot interpose themselves betwixt her, and her Native lustre:  278 The Glo-worme glisters not more by night, then it doth in obscurity: A pretious stone fittest for these times, and an ornament wel-beseeming the greatest Personage: for the cloud of Errour should not be able to obscure their thoughts, ever bending their course to the marke of honour. 279 The precious stone Diocletes , though it have many rare and excellent soveraignties in it, yet it looseth them all, if it be put in a dead Mans mouth. Wherein One makes a proper resemblance to Prayer ; which is the only Pearle and Jewell of a Christian: though it have many rare and exquisite vertues in it, yet it loseth them every one, if it be put into a Mans mouth, or into a Mans heart either, that is dead in sin, and doth not knocke with a pure hand. What soveraigne power the [illeg.]hites is sayd to reteine in repelling the poison and rebaiting the sting of the Viper ! What secret vertue lyes hid in the Dionysias in staying blood; as in others of effusing blood! Our naturall Historians make mention of a certaine stone found in the Lapwings nest; the  280 incredible occult vertue whereof is such, that the Party who beares it about him, shal by the power thereof make all things visible to him, yet he visible to none; discovering all things without discovery: disclosing others with a personal secrecy. No doubt but Gyges Ring had some relation to this stone; to whom Candaules , that doating King, shewed his wife naked: which indiscreete part reft him of Kingdome, Wife, and Life. For the Queene being grieved thereat, to have any strange Eye so familiarly knowne to the secrecy of her beauty; which even in native Modesty, exacted a vaile to priviledge it from such an open discovery, caused Gyges , upon the tender of her Princely affection, to slay the King; to take upon him the Kingdome, and to take her to his wife. This Gyges had a Ring (as Divine Plato reporteth) that had vertue to make him go invisible. They that looked upon Sylla's Ring, could not  281 choose but take notice both of Sylla's Seale and the Treason of Iugurth , because that was graven on the Seale. Excellent Morals are shadowed in these: and such as usefully applied, may redound highly to the appliers benefit. Strange effects are reported of the Calazia (by the Testimony of Hesych .) a stone of precious vertue, having in it spots like unto Haile. Soveraigne, as may be collected by what our Historians have writ of it, to cure any burne or inflammation. So as, this might well reteine that divine Hieroglyphick of one Cardinall Vertue, Temperance . If heate of affection transport us; any unbounded passion surprise us; the spirit of vaine-glory inflame us, that we cannot take our naturall rest with Themistocles , for his ambitious emulation after Miltiades : or finde that ravenous appetite ever raging, ranging and reigning in us, which sometimes accompanied that gluttonous Cambletes : or to satisfie our unconfined desires with the Delicacies of Earth, as if it were on Earth to satisfie Man, with licentious Lucullus : or to plot new devices how to innovate in a distemper'd State with Sertorius : or to enrich our Coffers by others ruines, and milch the State with our Oppressions, like another Acilius . If these, or any of these distempers seaze upon us, that Calazia of Temperance (for so is that Stone properly resembled) will moderate them in us: by reducing us to that Resemblance we had lost; and moulding in us that Effigies which we are above all others to love. For as nothing can be happily atchieved, or gracefully performed, unlesse it be seasonably acted: so no Vertue may properly reteine that Style, unlesse it be by Temperance seasoned. The Pyropus , what beauty and vertue it holds; all our Naturalists have amply discoursed. No Subject, be it never of so cold nor freezing a nature, can alter his temper. This Stone ever reteines his heate; so as, it may be properly compared to the temper of such a composed minde; who stands resolved against all the affronts or insults of Fortune. No palsey-feare can amate him; no distemper alter him. With the heate of his owne Nature hee knowes how to thaw all those icy congelations, which proceed from a weake or pusillanimous spirit. Such an Ones blood flies not from his heart to his face; but from his face to his heart. For though his outward visible part expresse a pallid feare; his heart scornes to give harbour to such a Traytor. He findes nothing so weake as that despicable minde; who Protheus -like, changeth his heart with the habit of the Time; and desires to comply with Greatnesse, and to fawne on silken Vice; vowing it, as one strucke amaz'd with the splendor of it, to be all vertuous. Much otherwise affected is his spirit, who like the unquenchable Pyropus , smiles at nothing more than the indignities of Fortune: and esteemes nothing lesse, than vicious Greatnesse. And if it chance at any time (as such Occurrents are every where obvious) that a base-creeping spirit, who relyed more on the shelter of Greatnesse , than Honour of Goodnesse , perish in his hopes, and dye in the straw: This tickles his honest Lungs with laughing Democritus ; closing his Observation with this Po eticall Ayre: This 'tis to build upon a Great mans word, And foole himselfe with following of a Lord. The Parius Lapis or Touch-stone, some, and that not improperly, have compared to affliction: It is this that trieth Man whether he be true-Touch or no. This confirmes that golden Sentence of a devout Man: "We are unknowne to our selves, till affliction Iye us open to our selves. We shall observe many, whose outward tincture promiseth nothing-lesse then the purest colour of Heraldry, prove Copper in the touch. All is not gold that glisters. Outward apparances are shady fallacies. The habit displayes not the Heart; nor the outward Semblance the inward disposition of the Mind. Cicero sayd of Galba's leaden and lumpish body: His wit had an ill lodging ; which may be truly applied to all these dissembling pretenders: such promising Leafes are ill bestowed on such barren Trees. Shadowes, though they hold a concomitance with Substance; yet are they never really the same. That man only deserves so noble a style, who imbraceth faith and fealty, intertaineth love and loyalty, improveth his courage and constancy amidst all encounters: yea, when the extreamest beleaguers and assaults of Fortune have done their worst, remaines ever  282 true-touch. In the discourse of the Ceremonies of Mecha , we shall find a rare device there recommended to our view, in the perpendicular placing of that Sepulchre of Mahomet : Meerely contrived by that cunning Projector to delude the Mahometans , by making them beleeve that to be a miraculous Object, which to more approoved and refined judgements appeared only a native experiment. Those that write of that Subject, describe it thus: There is an Adamant placed in the Roofe above, and a Magnet fixed in the pavement by an equall or direct line below; now, the Sepulchre of Mahomet made of solid iron, hangs in a Diametrall manner betwixt these two: without stay or supportance of either. This begot in those bewitched people a wonderfull amazement, honouring that Monument with their yearely Processionall visits; offring rich presents to that Mahometan shrine: never understanding those occult vertues of the two Stones fixed above and below; who, by their naturall opposition and enmity (as one maligning the others attractive quality) would not suffer that heavy ponderous body either to ascend or descend; but to reteine an equall site or location betwixt them both. This it was that confirmed these Mahometans in the strength of a deluded opinion, that their Mahomet was a great and powerful Prophet, shewing such high proofes and demonstrances of his extraordinary abilities living; and leaving such a Miracle for all posterity to admire in his departing. But to leave their effects, and returne to their Emblemes: The Adamant is compared to One that is truely-affectionate; ever bearing this peculiar Impresse: " Si me amas, mihi Adamas. Rare Experiments have our ancient Professants made of the Aspilates ; a Stone, according to the Testimony of Democritus , of a fiery colour, got in Arabia , and found in a certaine kind of Birds Nest. He reporteth, that this Stone being tyed with a Camels haire to any one troubled with the Spleane, it will cure him. Diodorus relateth of a kind of Salt, called Ammonick , and found in Affrick under Sand; when the Moone groweth toward the full; it is like Stone-allumne, and is medicinable in dissolving and purging of Fleagme. Pliny likewise reports strange things of the Ammonis Cornu ; being a precious Stone of the colour of Gold, representing the shape of a Rammes Horne ; of a powerfull quality in causing true Dreames. But many of these, I must freely confesse, like the Amalga , have farre more Moone than Sunne in them; being many times related, rather to beget admiration, than gaine credit: Albeit, wee are not altogether to distrust them, unlesse our owne Experience had found the contrary to evince them. Howsoever, sure I am, their Resemblances give an excellent grace and beauty to any discourse, whether Morall or Divine. There is a Crowne , (saith St. Peter ) that is undefiled, which never fadeth away . The Greeke words, ![](/images/inline/sb.gif) ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sb.gif) ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which St. Peter useth, are Latine words also: and they are not onely Appellatives , being Epithetes of this Crowne, but also Propers ; the one the proper name of a Stone,  283 the other of a Flower. For Isidore writeth, there is a precious Stone called Amiantus ; which, though it be never so much soyled, yet it can never at all be blemished: and being cast into the Fire, it is taken out still more bright and cleane. Also Clement writeth, that there is a Flower  284 called Amarantus , which being of a long time hung up in the House, yet it is still fresh and greene. To both which, the Stone and the Flower, the Apostle, as I am perswaded, alludeth in that place. To recount the vertues of all, were a superfluous Taske; for so should I make a Collection meerely of what hath beene written before, I only set downe with my selfe, to extract the speciallest, and to make resemblances of them with 285 the Native proportions of such things as are most usuall objects to our outward sences. I will briefly touch the admirable devices of Minerals, and so proceed to my intended Discourse. Mines the lower layd, the better: in them wee  286 disbowell (as it were) Nature of her hidden treasures; yet the Earth, like a kind and bountifull Mother willingly unrips her owne breast, to enrich her Children; the divers veines, and cordons which we find there, like hidden or concealed streames, having filled up their Treasure-channels (because so long time unemptied) minister store of all Mettals unto their Digger. C aesar in his Commentaries, seemes greatly to have delighted herein, having so quickly found out with what sorts of Mettals, these Brittaine -coasts most abounded: Some we have of these Mineralists that by the superficies of the Earth, can judge, what kinde of Mettall best agrees with that Soyle; and without piercing the ground (can prettily well) presage the event of their labour: Their Studies deserve cherishing, being grounded on honest foundations, and such as have much benefited their Countrey by their industry. 287 The North-part in their Copper-workes most laborious, merit their share of Commendations; both profiting themselves, and yeelding an ample gaine to the Kings Revenewes out of their Labours. The most precious Mines have beene ever found out in Regions least inhabited, and where the Inhabitants could make little or  288 no use of so large a bounty of Nature, as to this day among the Indians ; men that would exchange their preciousest things for trifles: like Æ sops Cock, preferring a Barley-corne before a Pearle. Yet in these labours (in themselves prayse worthy) I altogether disallow such (of which our reading ministers too many examples) that have digged the Sepulchres of the dead, to find some hidden Treasure buried with them. A sharpe Law was enacted (for this end) amongst the Æ gyptians , (which Nation used to interre their chiefe Jewels with the dead party) that whosoever should violate the sacred rites of the dead, by digging up their Treasures inchested with them, should be buried quicke. 289 A pretty story to this purpose is recorded of Semyramis , that valiant Queene of Assyria ; who before her death, commaunded that a faire Monument should be erected over her, upon which should be engraven this Inscription: Whosoever shall digge up this stone, let him but looke under it, and he shall finde an infinite masse of treasure. Cyrus having conquered that people, chanced to come where that curious monument was erected; and seeing this Inscription upon it, presently commaunded the Stone to be taken up; which being done accordingly, he found no Treasure, but this caution of better value then all Treasures: None but Fooles and Misers would digge up the bones of the dead . A reward well fitting the miserable desire of an infatiate Mind. I might annexe to this Discourse, the excellent study of Antiquities, and speake in part of them; But our coast is freighted with such elaborate Antiquaries, as the digression might seeme lesse necessary. Through all the body of this Discourse (including Physicall Relations) I have but shadowed the chiefest, without entention to intreate of every particular, using Valerius Maximus words: Quis omnis avi gesta modico voluminum numero comprehenderit ? I will descend to Mixt Histories , which was the last branch of my division. \------------------------------ Mixt Histories are composed, or compounded  290 of all those three, of which we have sufficiently entreated before. Variety of subjects best agree with the frame of these Writings: They expresse to the quicke, not only what was done Discursively, but what should have beene done 291 Morally, and deriving the event from probable causes, arising from nature, they conclude their Discourse, making it Universall. Some have stiled these Miscellanea , because a commixture of all affaires; they playing the Morall Philosopher aswell as Historian; comprehend all which the other could any way seeme to entreate of; being the abridgement of all Relations, and in themselves sufficient to produce incredible effects: they require especiall Reading, ripe Judgement, and an apt Disposition with all to make their members, so diversly hanging, unite in one maine body. And to descend now to a commendation of  292 Mixt Histories ; with instances of sundry Historians both Ancient and Moderne, who have bin usefully vers'd therein. There be none in my opinion, who better deserve the Palme in Subjects of this nature, then those ever- living Labours of Thuano's, Surius , with that excellently composed History of Paulus Iovius . And for a continued Allegory, never Relation deserved more approbation, both for Style and State, then Barclei's Argenes . An History, which puts on the face of things really done; yet meerely shadowing Persons of State, under borrowed names: Expressing his owne aymes in such an implicit, but pleasing manner, that this Isle (since such Assayes must of necessity be attempted) might have esteemed herselfe highly happy, in affording him a deserving Translator; or according to his own thoughts, a faithful Interpretor. Histories of this nature (as I have else where observed) doe not onely make relation of what is actually done; but insert such personall applications, as may benefit the understanding Reader; by making use of exploits done, and applying the use of what was formerly done, to succeeding times. Others harmes make us beware of incurring the like. Where Reading of men, and taking a punctuall Survey or Examen of their actions, we become many times wiser, than if we had beene wholly vers'd in reading of Bookes. It was a witty saying of an outwardly-contemplative man, Relegentur libri, relegantur viri . "Lay aside Bookes, and take your selves to reading of Men. So long as the World is a Theatre, Man must needes be an Actor. The Booke-holder stands in the Tyring-house; but the Action must be presented on the Stage. This, those excellent Historians, singularly expressed, and to life portrayed; when they made not onely mention of what was done, but the natures of those persons interessed in what was done. Heere they describe fiery-furious Spirits, more ready to attempt than advise: Action in these ever goes before resolution. Contrariwise, others of a flower but safer temper, consider of the end and issue, before they will attempt. No glowing spirit of ambition; no transportancy of vaine-glory can lessen their discretion. Their actions are rightly measured, because advise and deliberation are their Counsellours of State. This might be instanced in a fore-slowing Fabius , and forward Cethegus ; a precipitate Cleon , and a prepared Bracidas. 293 Now, in Discourses of this kind, there is a singular observation which I must necessarily recommend to all our Gentlemen who affect the reading of History; and this I have culled from that Father of all Historians, Plutarch himselfe.  294 Who, as he describes the Lives of such Princes or eminent Personages as he takes occasion to treat of; so he likewise paralels or compares their actions and dispositions one with another. Here he shewes what exploits such a person did; how he bore himselfe in the passage of them; how he came off with honour; how he moderated his affections in the atchievement of a victory; how he behaved himselfe to those he conquered; how he spared most, where he might most have spoyled. Here hee instanceth some more able to get a victory, than skilfull to use it: others wise enough in making use of it, having once obtained it. Some made happy by suffering misery: others miserable in never partaking infelicity. Some constant friends, but inconstant foes: others constant foes, but uncertaine friends. Some apter to perfwade, than personally to performe: Others had all their Rhetorick plac'd in action: Their Oratory was a Martiall Summons: yet what they wanted in discourse to bring on their Souldiers; they supplyed in boldnesse of adventures: exposing their persons to all dangers. Some stout enough of spirit, while their bodies were weake; but weake in spirit when their bodies grew strong. To confirme this, hee reports that Antigonus had in his army a valiant Souldier; but of a sickly body: Antigonus observing his valour; and grieving that so stout a resolution should bee seconded by so weake a constitution, procured his Physitians to take him in hand; and he was healed. Now being sound, he beganne to fight in some feare; to keepe himselfe a good distance from danger, no more venturing into the vanne or forlorne place of the battell. Antigonus noting, and wondering at this alteration, asked him the cause of this new cowardise. He answers, "O Antigonus , thou art the cause. Before I ventured nothing but a diseased Corpes, and then I choose rather to dye quickly, then to live sickly: I invited death to doe me a kindnesse. Now it is otherwise with me, for I have somewhat to lose. Such delightfull passages as these, shall we every where finde interveined in these mixt Discourses. I approve of Salusts opinion: Ex ijs Negotijs qua ingenie exercentur, in primis magno usu est memoria rerum gestarum . Yet of all those Records, none in themselves more eminent, because none more elaborate than mixt Histories : they contract in one leafe (as it were) what a whole  295 Volume could scarcely comprehend. There must be a generall knowledge in these discourses, making a well-composed body of many scattered limbes, gathered from the Relickes, or ashes of their deceased Authors. For as a good Limner wil not see any blemish in his portraiture; but (ere he hang it out) will desire to make every part and proportion in a kinde of correspondency, to move a more deepe impression in the beholder: So should there be an equall correspondency in these kinde of Histories, letting no discourse passe (if of consequence) without a mixture of both Morall, and Physicall reasons; left one little blemish (one omission of either) should be a disparage to the whole. Here Antomedon -like, he should set out vertues Table, making his life a Globe of Precepts: There, like an excellent Naturallist, he should dilate upon the natures of things, or probable reasons (as as I said before) derived from Nature. The master-piece (like the warpe in the webbe) is Discourse: for these Butteresses, without a maine foundation, would soone decay. Wits compared to Soiles: some naturally fruitfull, without forcing: others, without continuall labour and tillage, will bring forth nothing but tares (or the Husband-mans teares.) Some fit for Barley, others for Wheat, Oates, or the like: and  296 some most apt for Misselane. So in wits, some naturally ripe and forward; others require a more deliberate dispatch: the one more present, the other more solid. Pregnant and ripe wits are not so good; they are like a Rasor keene  & sharpe, but his edge is soone rebated. One compared them, & not unfitly, to soft wood, ready to receive any impression from the Limner; but for warping, is unable to keepe, and therefore not fit for any worthy or curious portraiture. Such wits are these, which be rather apt for invention, than judicious scanning of any Authors: they can invent, better than extract; and consequently unfit for these mixed Discourses whereof we now entreate. Exquisite Labour is the producer of these Histories; which (for the most part) is intollerable to your sharpest wits; being rather for the present, than any serious deliberation. Salust in his Iugurthine Warre , includes a  297 pretty commixture of Histories, as if hee had intended to make a President for Relations of this kind, where he brings in Micipsa upon his death-bed, speaking to his sonnes: Equidem ego regnum vobis trado sirmum: Si boni eritis, sin mali, imbecillum . Wherein hee so lively characters the state of Princes, and the morall instruction of a Father dying, to his Children, with the severall Natures and Dispositions of them; that it seemes he purposed to instance this kind of writing in so excellent a Subject. Here he shews Dissimulation in a Prince, even at his end: there an unworthy plot of an adopted Sonne, seeking to reigne by indirect meanes. Here Micipsa exhorts them; with, colite talem hanc virum, imitamini virtutem . Yet he intimates with all, his feare of aspiring, seeing his Nature so boundlesse. There he describes the jealous doubts, and perplexed windings of Adherball ; there the drooping spirit of Hyempsall , and the royall disposition of Iugurth : so as by reading their divers natures, one might conjecture for whom the government of Numidia was reserved. 298 These Histories are most fruitfull, they draw both Attention, and they comprehend in them great plenty of Instruction. Attention by their Variety, Instruction by their Morality; including a perswasive kind of writing in the one, and a delightfull proceeding, or continuance in the other. Some Historians in this kind, and not unfitly, lay open the causes of decayes in Cities, Empires, and Governments: as Romes fall proceeding from her imperiall Pride, Babylons from her Riot, the Medes from their Security, the Tyrians from their sumptuousnesse in Apparrell; the Christians (in Easterne parts) more to their shame, and our griefe, from their civill dissention among themselves. Occasion might be here taken of laying open those especiall grounds, from whence our Historians have probably drawne their Reasons of enfeebling the greatest and flourishingst States; taking breath, as they conceived, from these three particulars: Innovation in Government, Manners, Habit. 299 For the first; no Instance more to life, than when the Roman Monarchy became rint and divided to the Triumviri ; The Empire begun to feele strange Scepters. The former state of Government, which had made it selfe so fearefull to her Neighbour-kingdomes, as they feared nothing more than to offend their Mistresse ; (for so might Rome at that time be properly styled) became more sleighted. Those sinewes of Warre, which before shewed strength in her publick Treasury, became exhausted; Those Lawes , which either the necessity of the present time had enacted, or the fulnesse of their State required, through the difference of Commanders, neglected. The saying is, Plants transplanted seldome thrive; No more, Empires, when their state of Government is altered; their ancient Lawes annulled; the rule by which they were formerly directed, wholly relinquished. New Lords will alwayes have new Lawes: and to their Examples are their Followers ever moulded. There is nothing that beseemes our naturall complexion better than her owne colour; whatsoever it borrows of Art, rather blemisheth than bestoweth any beauty on her. I must confesse indeed, that in the dresse or fashion of our Attire, many devices there are (presupposing ever that they be not apish nor garish) which give a good grace to the Wearer, and doe better become him, in respect of the time wherein they are used, than if the Old Wardrobes of our Ancestors were ransacked, and those ancient Weares brought againe in request. But Antiquity ever holds best correspondency in Mannagements of State: the more the manner of their Government is altered; the more their Manners are for most part corrupted. This it was, that so much afflicted Solon ; after such time as hee had laboured to settle the State; revive her usefull Lawes; and lay downe all grounds that might any way improve their Government. After all this, I say, to see the people given to Innovation ; rejecting with much sleightnesse and contempt, what hee had both by travaile and counsell endeavoured to establish and enact. This grieved him more than his owne Banishment, or whatsoever that unthankfull Age could possibly inflict. 300 Secondly, for Manners ; Those are best-beseeming, which are most Native. Alwayes provided, that those places or Countries be Civill, where those Manners are used, or Lawes observed. The Scythians were not to conforme themselves to the Manners nor Discipline of the AElig;gyptians ; nor these to the Scythians . The Laconians , whose strict Discipline both for Meate, Drinke, and Apparell, made them imitable Presidents to their Neighbours; could not endure that the proud Babylonian should commerce with them; nor the dis- passionate Theban to converse with him; nor the covetous Tyrian to trucke or traffick with him; nor the riotous Sydonian to take repast with him; nor the soucerous AElig;gyptian (who was no lesse blacke in superstition than he was of complexion) to consort with him. Their ancient Manners they reteined; which not observed, they ever feared, that their State (as they had exemplarily seene in others) might be enfeebled. Thirdly and lastly, touching Habit , (a small thing may some suppose to dissolue the maine  301 Fabricke of a mighty State) we shall finde what care and fedulity some States haue vsed in reteining the ancient Habit , recommended to them by their Ancestors. Darius having altered the fashion of his blade, which vsed to be Persian , into the forme of the Macedonian ; in the yeare before he fought with Alexander , the Chaldees or Soothsayers prophecied, that into what fashion as Darius had altered his Sword, it would become Ruler of Persia . And the issue or conclusion seconded this prediction. Semyramis commanded all to weare Tyars vpon their heads, and to put vpon them Womans apparell, to cover their effeminate parts. But this new effeminacy of Habit brought a speedy subversion to that State: For vpon the death of their Queene, whose imperiall mind affected nothing more then command, this their Womanish Habit brought them into contempt. Thus haue the flourishingest Commonweales  302 fallen to desolation and dissolution, their highest Spires ruinate, their Temples, with their Places of prophane adoration, defaced; nothing remaining to boast of, save that they once were  303 happy, once victorious. Yea, Iugurth himselfe seemes to expresse the cause of Romes ruine; shewing how subject they were (even the purple Fathers, the reverent Benchers) to take bribes, and receiue oyntments, wch would close their mouths for speaking in the Common- weales behalfe. For when he was complained of vnto the Senat, for the murder of Hyempsall : and the Senat having then government over Numidia in chiefe; which Realme (as others) was tributary to them, commanded Iugurth to appeare before them vpon such a day; fully resolved to punish his insolencies. He so wrought by rewards, as their censure was not onely mittigated, but (as the Historian records) Tanta commutatio incessit, vt ex maxim a invidia in gratiam & favorem nobilit atis Iugurtha veniret . A strange Metamorphosis, when states were so soone changed, which portended a sudden change of their government, falling from so great glory, and eminence, to eternall obscurity. Many Histories of these natures there be,  304 which depend vpon apt allusions, equally mixt with Discursiue, Morall, and Physicall: Discursiue to delight and tricke on the appetite, by a sweet variety; seeing the change of great states in a few Leaues; being a speech meerely documentall, to better our Liues, teach us what should be done, as well in private as publike. Physicall, in the character of severall natures, aptly accommodated to the Subject whereof we entreate. With what delight do we reade the divers inclinations  305 of Princes? Here a Catiline , doing little, and speaking much: There a Iugurth , doing much, and speaking little. Here a Philip drunke. and in his drunkennesse raging against his foes: there an Alexander, drunke too; but in his passion raging against his best friends. Here a C aesar , then whom, none ever did more good to his followers: there 2 Nero , then whom, none more desertlesse to his followers. Here a working crafty wit, stirring up trifling rewards, to containe him in suspence; instanced in Tiberius : there an affable mind, set out in threed-bare words, one that could never flatter; specified in Titus. These severall natures we may see, and marke what successe they had: Some, the more thinking, the more not knowing what to thinke: yet to obserue the worke of Heaven, seldome or never haue these suspitious heads cause to rest; but the more they suspect, the more motiues they  306 haue to suspect: for this craft is alwayes hatefull, and procureth enemies: Subtill councels being odious vnto the world, and so dis-favoured of God, that they are alwayes waited on, and attended with most vnprosperous ends. We shall see in prophane stories a maine diversitie, even in the  307 simplest and shallowest vnderstandings; the subtillest sconses the meanes of their owne decay; as in Sejanus , who in the opinion of his owne worth grew in time, Ferox sceleris : Such aspiring spirits be (for the most part) vsed like Sponges, wet with their spoyles and extortions, with which being a long time soaked, they are at last crushed and condemned, that their long-gathered wealth might returne to the Princes Coffers. Trajan vsed to call the Treasury or Exchequer (by way of comparison) the Spleane , because it increasing, brings to all the other parts a pining. What Various Occurrents, nay fearefull and vnexpected Disasters haue ever beene the attending  308 feares of ambitious Spirits; No Historie but can beare witnesse. How safe and secure haue many lived; Free from feares within, and Foes without; Retired from the Concourse of litigious Plaintiffs; Clamour of Courts; Heate of Corrivals: Nay, whatsoever else might breed their disquiet? Yet see the misery of Ambition! On they must, be it to their ruine. Examples they find store to caution them; precepts both divine and morall to informe them. Yet neither can the former worke any impression on them; nor the latter by more easie perswasions waine them. Commines reports, how Charles the third, vnder whom he so long time served, communicating himselfe so freely both in matters of advice and action for the advancing of his service; was ever casting in his mind after businesse of greatest difficulty; "Yea such, perhaps, saith he, ,, as exceeded the abilities of man. This was a strange disposition; And yet we shall meete with many of this nature, both in the course of our Reading and Living. We shall obserue some, who, though they haue a faire-bet path to walke in, yet will they leaue the tracke, and make the Wall or some other high Mount their Walke. So fates it with these, who had rather fish in Troubled Waters, then when they are Calme. No Night so darke; no perill so fatally imminent: But with cheerefulnesse they will attempt, what their inconsiderate boldnesse pompts them to. Nor is this their forwardnesse forc'd out of want; For many of these abound in all fulnesse; rich in fortunes; Strong in followers: Yet miserable in both these. For as their fortunes feed their followers: So doe their followers feed on them. These Faunes are they, who make Fooles of their Masters; And by throwing out strange lures, miserably seaze on them. The daring D' Ambois , and that braue Byroun were Spirits of this temper. Great enough in Princes favour; loaden sufficiently with honour; onely vnhappy in this, in that they knew not their owne happinesse: Miserable, in that they had never tasted misery. It is well observed by one, in his Discourse of this Subject; that of all frenzies, there is none that madds man more then Ambition. It makes him thinke he walks altogether invisible; Ixion was never more deceiu'd with a Cloud, then he is with his disguise. There is one thing more in it; this madding fancy, or raving frenzy is of that nature, as no friend can be secure, so his fall may purchase their aime. Clitus Constancy cannot secure him, when Ambitious heate mixt with Wine, egges on his Master to an indeliberate revenge. Yet see the just doome of these! Who, as they build their plottes vpon vnsure Grounds; Or, which is of all others hatefull'st, because to themselues in their passage hence the heaviest, on blood; Which is never shed in vaine: So are they to receiue, what their deluded greatnesse made them belieue they could never suffer. 309 Then, and never till then, are they brought to acknowledge, that a greatnesse can be no Subterfuge to guiltinesse. Then must that veile, which had so long shrowded them from the sight of men, be removed; their princely persons with their vnprincely actions discovered and paralel'd. So poore a Support is painted Clay to build vpon. Nor be these Ambitious Spirits onely heere to be taxed; who, though they fall, they fly faire: But such, who abuse that place to which their Princes favour hath raised them; by base mercenary wayes. These are they who play the Sharkes vnder the hatches. Not a petition must be presented, but it must be guilded. As for their owne Suites, they little care how they worke vpon the Spirit of the State; how they discourage the peoples just indeavours; how they increase the Widdowes teares, aggravate the Orphans wrongs, and multiply their abuses to maintaine their Surfets. Or if parcimonious,  310 how they enrich their owne Coffers with others Curses. For these, I would haue them made Spunges of; that as they suckt and milkt the Lowest, so they might be soakt and mulc't by the Highest. The simple (or innocently-imagining Statist) comes ever to an expected end in his hopes; as they are not great, so not subject to so great an Eclypse: yea, the hopes of these men attaine sometimes ends aboue expectance: Such was Helvius Pertinax his successe, who (never aiming at the Title of Emperour ) was crowned when he was from thoughts of Titulary honour most sequestred: Repugnansque suscipiens , vsing a kinde of withstanding ere he would entertaine so great a weight. And in all Histories, if we obserue the divers occurrents which befell men in great and eminent places, we shall see ever the honestest purposes seconded with the happiest events, and the disproportion of the end ever sorting with the discordance of the mind: for the intention is discussed by Him that layeth the foundation of all Empires in dust at his pleasure: breathing ever vpon the sincere purposes of the good, and confounding the deepe designes (vpon what pretence soever grounded) of the evill. In Mixt Histories (as the Scope whereat they aime) is mixed part with profit, and part with  311 delight, to make the Discourse more compleat: So should the seriousnesse of the Subject attract a kinde of Majesty to it; for impossible it is, either with trimnesse of words, propriety of aptly annexed, and duly-applied sentences, or any other elegancy whatsoever, to make a Subject (of it selfe light and frivolous) beare the portray of State: For words (if well applyed) illustrate and adde a beauty, but not any way better the weight of the matter. There be three things which be especially required 312 in Histories of this nature, to make them perfect: first Truth, in sincerely relating, without having any thing (as Tacitus observeth) haustum ex vano , foysted in by our owne invention, to smooth the passage of our story. Secondly, an Explanation in discovering, not onely the sequels of things, but also the causes and reasons drawing to the conclusions. Thirdly, Iudgement in distinguishing things by approving the best, and disallowing the contrary. 313 For the first, Stories should be true, or at least resemble truth, because by so much, they are more pleasing, by how much they resemble truth the neerer; and so much more gracefull, by how much more probable and lesse doubtfull. We haue many Histories (even of this kind) mixed, that comprehend in them nothing lesse then truth: Yet by their smooth carriage, and their proper circumstances with such aptnesse drained and disposed, they haue beene taken for truth, and registred amongst Workes of more serious consequence. Such were those Apolog ae Fabulae (whereof we haue in part spoken before) which contained in them many pitthy and graue sentences, and worthy observation in the excellent'st Morall. these are fitly called by Tully, Mirrors of Mans life, Patternes of Manners, and Images of truth . Their neere resemblance of truth, made the Reader more attentiue, subjecting his care to Discourses probable, more then to things surpassing the bounds and limits of beliefe; as producing vnheard of miracles (meere conceptions of the braine) phanaticke Chymeras: A Gyant immured in a Rocke, yet able to pierce it through, winne a whole Monarchy with his owne single hands, leade a multitude of Kings captiues, and returne home without a wound. Here strange Inchaunted Castles, Ladies and Knights detained in most base seruitude by an Airy Monster: there admirable victories purchased vpon incredible oddes: and the rather to be believed, because it pleaseth the painter so to deliniate their vertues. These relations, as they proceed for most part  314 from a conceipt, whose wits are long since gone a Woo!-gathering; so to any serious judgement they become so meerely ridiculous, as they are hissed at by the peruser, howsoever they seeme to receiue entertainement by the vulgar. For I haue formerly observed, to describe the winning of a Fort, before the approach of a Foe; Or the razing of a Citty, without discovery of any apparant Enemy, perplexeth the vnderstanding: and leaues the Conceipt in tangled. An orderly proceeding in arguments of this nature, deserve best approvement: For the ignorance or want of observance of Order distracts the Conceipts, and makes whatsoever is read, tedious to the Reader. In this, Vitruvius merits high praise. His writings are faire and formall, Hee first lieth Siedge; then he proceeds to Occasionall Treaties: next, he lyes downe the reasons either of accepting or rejecting what is propounded. Not an improbability will he admit of, least it should impaire the credit of his History. In those Warres betwixt old Astiages and his Grand-child Cyrus ; wherein much Civill blood was shed, before the Empire of the Medes was reduced to a Persian State; Such principall Allyes as came on in defence of Astiages , after their defeate, became ingaged to the like hazard. Astiages did not onely suffer, but those also who came to his succour. He then, that should in any weake historicall relation, averre, that the sole ground  315 of Cyrus his incursion into Lydia , was the desire he had to seaze vpon Cr aesus treasure, rather then any proceeding displeasure, should fayle much in the trust of a Relater. For our antient Historians describing the first occasionall grounds of all those fatall differences; report, how that Lydian King, vpon a long league of amity continued betwixt them, or some other propositions of reward for so necessitated a curt'sie, addressed himselfe with a strong Army for his defence. Yet, by the martiall and experienced power of the Persians , who were expert Slingers, and of strong tempers, able to endure any labour; Cyrus became victorious; his Enemies, Subjects of his Triumph. Which exploit hee had no sooner atchieved, then he turned his Sword vpon such as had beene Assistants to the adverse part. Wherein, as Cr aesus had showne himselfe most forward, so he was one of the first that he assaulted. Then, and never till then, and for no other was this acted then; came the treasures of that rich Prince to be surprized; his princely Pallace to be ransacked; his sumptuous Wardroabe disroabed: and he himselfe exposed to the extreamest Censure of a commanding Conquerour. Though Cyrus Clemency, vpon that serious consideration of humane inconstancy, pardon'd him his life, and made him his Homager in his owne Kingdome. The like might be instanced in those Civill Warres betwixt C aesar and Pompey . Though the victorious C aesar had got the day, and made himselfe happy in the acquisition of a doubtfull victory; his ambition became not so confin'd; nor his hate so attemper'd; as to stay there. Such, who had vsed their best endeavours in defence of his Enemy, must feele the heavie hand of his Soveraignty. Though some, who were nearely allyed to his discomfitted Foe, or held integrious Members of the Romane State, were received with a gracefull Countenance: Yea, and advanc'd to vnexpected honours, vpon their submission to his innovated Government. Great was the delight which that Vniversall Monarch of the World conceived in the Brachmans : highly likewise was he taken with the answers of those Indian Oracles; the strangenesse where of might be got an Improbability were not the Surveyer his owne Relator: but discoursing of every Circumstance that might any way enliven the Survey of those parts: He expresseth in a modest Majesticke Stile what he had scene or heard: not deriving these from others report, but from his owne personall knowledge. This may appeare in those discoveries which he so freely communicates in a Letter to Aristotle his Master: where, amongst other memorable Sights, he tells him how he had seene those two Trees consecrated to the Sunne and Moone , with their Oracular discourse to him. The first Report of the strangenesse of these, no doubt, made him retire a little from Martiall affaires; and to take breath a while, that he might more fully Obserue their Occult natures and effects. For at such time, as this Spreading commander came into those parts, the Inhabitants there related to him the incredible power of those Trees in this manner. "Thou shalt see (said they) what King soever thou bee, two Trees of the Sunne and Moone , Speaking both the Indian and Greeke tongues; The one whereof being a Masculine Oake, is consecrated to the Sunne : The other Feminine, is dedicated to the Moone : and by these shalt thou know what good or evill soever shall befall thee. This said, the Priest , to whom, any one that intended to enter that Sacred Caue, as they esteem'd it, were to repaire, told him; That if he were freed from the Vse or knowledge of Women , he might enter that holy place . And sayes Alexander , "I obeyed the man in all things, as was fitting to conforme my selfe to a religious Observation. Which done, the Priest expected when the Sunne would set. In which attendance, I carried along with mee my three faithfull friends, Perdiccas, Clitus , and Philotas. Now in this Historicall Progression , you shall heare what Alexander , by way of consultation demands of the Oracle. "I thought in my mind (saith he) to inquire whether having conquered the whole World, I might in triumph returne into my Countrey, to my Mother Olympia and my loving Sisters? Then suddenly in the Indian Tongue, and in a small voyce the Tree answered: "Invincible in Warre shalt thou be, Alexander ; according to thy demand, the Sole Lord of the whole world, but returne aliue thou shalt not into thine owne Countrey. So haue the Destinies Decreed touching thy life. After this, Alexander descends to speake of the Tree sacred to the Moone . Which (faith he) at the very first rising of the Moone being summoned by an horne, having received her full light, answered in the Greeke tongue after this sort. " Alexander (said it) as yet thou hast not approched the full end of thine age, but the next yeare in the Moneth of May thou shalt dye in Babylon. By him shalt thou be deceived, whom thou least suspected. After all this (though little beseeming so virile a Spirit ) he speakes of those teares he shed, after these Oracular Trees had divined these things. "Then I wept (saith he) and my friends who stood about me; wept with me, without guile or subtilty, being ready to dye for my safety. But little moved these gentle teares, those Gentile Gods: "for the Priest (saith he) advised us to depart thence, because (quoth he) you offend these Holy Trees with your weeping and howling. These relations haue we inserted, that it may appeare how those things which of themselves may otherwise seeme improbable , being onely reported from the mouth of others; receiue sufficient authority by so princely a Testimony; being confirmed by his owne Eyes and Eares, and committed to memory for authentick and vndoubted truth. Whereas, others there be of a different nature; who make the whole body of their discourse an indisposed heape of rubbish, or immateriall matter: with a purpose to vend such vnauthoriz'd stuffe to delude a weake conceipt; who usually reades what is done, but never deliberately collects how this may be probably or possibly done. We read of a people called Acephaloi , and these haue no heads: and of this cause are all these improbable Relaters. Who, as they are Acephalists , and without a founder: So are they Apodes , and without a Supporter, These are not much vnlike to indiscreet Actors, who no lesse vnseasonably then improperly, make choice both at that time and of that place to present their merriments, when and where Tragick passages should be peronated. Or like our too secure Architectists , who contriving how to make their house most for strength, to barre all hope of entrance to their Foes, build on still, but forget to make a doore to giue admittance to their friends. But of these erronious stories there be some observe no method, planting an Arcadie in Brittany [illeg.] as if by some super-naturall accident there were  316 a transplantatio of Regions, or some Earth-quake in the Authors braine, whence this immanne Colosse of an irregular Discourse proceeded. Which strange representatios be not vnlike to your Lanskip; where vpon the sea, whatsoever we see by land, seemes in our saile to go with us: Even so do these vain Historians make strange objects vnto us of places impossible, transiting whole Countries to make an impolished straine of pastoral musick (one good Bell- weather would make as perfect harmony) found well in a Clownes care. To be short, my opinion positiuely is this: That Historian wch can joyne profit with a modest delight together in one body or frame of one vnited discourse, grounding his story vpon an essentiall truth, deserves the first & principall place: and he who (vpon a feined discourse) can proportio it to a likenesse of truth, merits ye next. As for him that (like one of Duke Humphreyes Knights) observes neither meane nor measure, but gorge their owne insatiate appetites with full messes of vntruths (without probability) should be dealt withall, as that wandring Italian Squire was vsed, for his monstrous lying: Tost in a Blanket, till his erring spirit by suffumigations, or some such like means, were canvased out of him. Great blemishes these be to so reputed a Profession, aiming neither at profite nor most delight, but imitating your Mercenary Actors, spurt out some obscaene jeast to make a prophane Rogue applaud him: and sure if the strict-doome and censure of banishment, were to be inflicted vpon any kinde of learning, rather should it be pronounced against such as these then any. The Pagans haue abhorred them, and much more odious should they bee in a Christian Common- wealth, where vertue should be the scope of all our actions. They are like some Comoedies wee read now a dayes; The first Act whereof is in Asia , the next in Affrica , the third in Europa , the fourth in America : and if Ptolomeus , or Marcus Paulus had found out a fifth part of the world, no question but it had beene represented on their vniuersall Stage: Such as these ought to haue some distinct language, Vtopian , or some other grunting tongue engrossed to themselues: For they should profite more, by being lesse vnderstood. Much they speake of valour, and many imaginary Heroes are pitching their Pavillions; But I will take my leaue of them with my French Proverbe: Beaucoup de bruit, e peu de fruict : Much bruite, but little fruite: Battels more fierce (by report) then Alcazors : That was but Kings, their's Giants: and one of those Giants as able to vanquish all those Kings, as for Milo to carry his Ball on his shoulders. For the second: There should be an explanation in discovery of the causes, with a direct and  317 graduall proceeding to the sequels: As thus, in description of a solemne Iust, or Tournament, it is necessary for the Historian to show the cause why such Solemnities were instituted. I doe know many things there be in Discourses, which may be as well implyed as inserted; But in Festivals, solemne Games, events of Duello's, or publicke Trials: The causes forcing should and ought to be as well decyphered, as the ends succeeding. How should we haue knowne of the vniting of the Sabines with the Romanes , or the occasion of their Marrying together, but by those dissembled Feasts ordained by Romulus , to bring his purpose to effect: The circumstances of which feast (are with a certaine concordancy) amongst most of the Romane Writers agreed on; standing (though with too nice precisenesse, I confesse) vpon the place, occasion, and houre of the day, with such a liuely Transcription, as if the Sabine Rape had beene committed in their time. The like we reade of the destruction and vtter  318 subversion of the Gabians , in the time of Tarquin Superbus : The generall vnion of Historians, about the time, place, and occasion, so concordantly jumping, as if all those proceedings (as well in the Stratagems by Terquins youngest Sonne, as  319 the very Contents of that Letter writ by the Father to his Sonne, for the management of this exploit) had bene set downe by one penne. The like harmony of Historians in their Relations, 320 though writ in severall ages; may be gathered from the Annals both of antient and our more moderne Authors. Those long continued Warres betwixt the Athenians and Lacedemonians , with what agreement and concordancy even in every Circumstance, are they delivered? No Land-exploit but expressed to life as it was acted; and so fully presented, as Succeeding times received them for infallible Records. That tenne yeares Siege of Troy ; where so many designes were attempted; so many bloody Stratagems devised; where strength and policy equally contended: while nothing was unassayed, whereby so deepe a blemish or staine of dishonour done to a warlike Nation might be revenged: what joynt union or harmony holds it amongst most Authors, who have enlarged themselves upon that Subject? This might be instanced in Dares Phrygius himselfe; one personally imployed in that Service, and writ afterwards what soever had hapned during that heavie fatall Siege. Nor was it held sufficient to these, onely to describe the fearefull Events of those calamitous Warres; but the Grounds and Origenes of them. How their first hate begun; how increased; and by what Offices made implacable. Heere is Paris portrayed; how he became enamoured; how in his wanton suite enterrained; how after Helens consent to a licentious assault, her conveyance is practised; the voyage accommodated; and the very Ship, wherein these two lustfull Lovers were imbarked, described. Where you shall find Phereclus , that curious Carpenter of Troy , preparing that fatall Ship, wherein Helen was stolne away by Paris. Then, you shall heare what entertainement old Priam giues to these two youthfull Saylers after their arrivall. What Feasts are solemnized; what Sumptuous Triumphs prepared; and to what a wofull Catastrophe all these goodly Solemnities are converted. Then, what Embassies are sent (before ever Warre was proclaimed) to re-demand Helen . Their peremptory answer to so just a demand. Then, those fearefull predictions of Troyes destruction. Yet behold the inevitable Fate of a declining State! Neither could the justnesse of their request; nor those Ominous fore-runners of their irreparable fall, divert them from an vnexpected ruine. Vnexpected indeed, for glorying in their owne strength, and inclining to the importunacy of a Lascivious youth; they denied to restore a light commodity, to saue their State from an ensuing misery. Yet in these, shall you find the Citty divided in opinion. Some held it fitting to restore, what they in Iustice did require. Others, and those of the inconsideratest ranke, side with Paris : perswading him to enjoy his stolne Fruite: to keepe her in despight of Greece : and to triumph in such a booty, as surpassed nature in attractiue beauty. Then, their recourse to the Oracle; the answers they received: Yet must Helen be still deteined; that lust may be revenged: and a perishing beauty with the losse of a perishing City, vnwillingly restored. All these are with so harmonious a consent seconded, as if they had writ in one time; or one had dictated to another, what soever in that Theatre of sorrow had bene Acted. The like in that Combat, or bloudy Banket, rather, of Thomyris her eldest sonne, and the Persian Cyrus , with such natiue descriptions of every circumstance; the River Araxis , the place of their passage, the reasons which moved Thomyris to suffer their passage, and the very plot where their Tents were pitcht, their dainty viands left for the Scythian surfet, in what sort prepared, and how insatiably desired by the Scythian Army, comming rather to feast then to fight: And then their defeate, being there vanquished, where they were most confident of victory. In these explanations, the Reader should not be delayed, or frustrated too much in his hopes, by vnnecessary ambages: We should not trifle out the time in vaine and impertinent repetitions, it cloies and satiates the appetite too much: not vnlike to your great feasts, reserving the choyfest dainties for the end, when the appetites of the Guests are satisfied before they come. It is a good frugall course, and includes an Oeconomicke pollicy, their best dishes may be preserved for another time. He that discovers events and sequels without their preceedent causes, is as one that would draw a River dry, without knowing whence the Spring is derived: applying the conclusions of things, as it pleased the Ethnickes in ancient time, to referre them to the arbiterment of Fortune; making ever this womanish argument: The event was so, because it was so; and it was so, because Fate would haue it so : answering Titus opinion, Potestates fato dari . But these which thus apply the course of all conclusions to Fortune, be as blind as Fortune: Nay, farre more; for though Fortune be blind, yet she is not invisible: But these men are not onely blind in the eye of common sence, but invisible in the  321 composure of their owne Arguments; their Conclusions being as blind as themselves. In making likewise our judgement of Histories, and considerately applying it to our present interests, we must specially regard the dispositions of the Agents, and diligently remarke how they are affected in mind; this is the least deceiving ground of forming opinion. By the nature of the Agent, conjecturall events or reasons of events may be drawne: As if an ambitious man be imployed in Embassage twixt Prince and Prince, he is to be suspected that his Treaty will be lesse happy, in that his illimited passions oft-times, rather aggravate then allay causes of civill discord. Men of moderate dispositions, purchase peace with lesse adoe,  & more successefull; For Princes (ballancing their owne wrongs,  322 to their apprehension insupportable) cannot endure braving, but will rather try the extreamest of Fortune, then be vnworthy of themselves, by hearing and bearing affronts with patience. The like we haue observed in the successe of Warre; a wise and experienc't Leader, to haue  323 accomplished great matters with a handfull of men; and that Aphorisme to be very true: Better is an Army of Harts, with a Lyon to their Leader, then an Army of Lyons, having an Hart to their Leader : And contrariwise, the vnhappie events of most flourishing Empires, the miserable slaughters of most puissant Armies, by the vnadvised government of their Agents, or tyranny of their Regents, whose improvidence made much people vnfortunate: To see Hanniball once a Conquerour, because his hopes were not seated on in direct meanes; and afterwards by his owne truculent disposition, to become a prey to the conquered, makes this Assertion good. No doubt, but the indiscretion of Commanders,  324 becomes the vtter subversion of their designes. Where, we shall finde some more apt for command, then to be commanded; Others fitter to be commanded, then command. There may be alledged divers reasons for this. Such, whose vnbounded Spirits are ever taken with high exploits, many times more boldly then wisely, will not stick to expose their persons to all perils; so they may haue the honour of the day; and beget a reverence in their Souldiers. Such as these, as I conceive, are fitter to receiue command from another, then to be Commanders of others. For a discreet Commander (as I haue formerly observed) is not to ingage his person in too desperate attempts. That commanding Regent of the World, was sometimes highly censured for this: when in scaling of a Citty, hee would be so venterously bold as to mount first the Walls; but rather to haue the passage prepared, before he ascended. Besides all this, divers Commanders there haue beene, who eying their owne power, and transported with their successe; from Commanders of an Army, haue struck at a Monarchy. Sylla's perpetuall Dictatorship implyed no lesse ambition: nor Sertorius his keeping himselfe aloofe from the State, lesse aspiring. High Spirits, puffed vp with the glory of their victories, are for most part so inclined. Those tyes, wherein they stand ingaged to their Prince and Countrey, are sleighted; the basenesse of ingratitude they have no mind to thinke on. Ever are they expostulating with themselves, what it is to be seazed of an absolute Soveraignty, to be subject to none; to command all; to haue their Will their Law. To infrachise friends; confine Foes; To bestow a new face on the State. These are the flourishes, which so delude them, as neither the obedience they owe the State, nor the safety of their owne persons may prevaile with them: Such as these, are vnhappy agents for themselues: for howsoever they seeme to gather head, and with factious Male-contents to fuell their vnprosperous strength; they ever come home rewarded according to their deserts. Faire pretences, as vindicating either publique or private wrongs, freeing the oppressed State from exactions, easing the injuried, and punishing the insolent, receiue at first an easie impression; but no sooner shall their Complyes observe the indirectnesse of their ends, then they fall from them, least by cleaving too long to them, their greatnesse faile them. These showes pretended that haire brain'd Catiline ; who the better to bring them on, whom he sought to joyne to him, by dividing them from the State, and ranking them with his owne; tills them on with faire promises of New Tables, 325 proscriptions of the rich, magistracies, priest hoods  , rapines, and rich booties, with all other things, that either Warre or the will of a Conquerour may any way tender . Braue offers, if they were his to giue; but how soone did that Sunne which so fairely seem'd to shine, set in a Cloud to his shame? There is another Error too incident to a Commander; and that is in making him else too familiar with his Souldier . The Iewes , during Titus 326 his abode in Iudea , in perfitting that designe which his Father had begun, held that Princes mildnesse to be flothfulness; his clemency, a remisse security. Whereas hee, out of his princely ly humanity, pittied their present misery. But this conceipt they retayned of Titus , (as may bee probably gathered) by reason of the famiaritie hee used to his Souldiers. Truth is, Affabilitie begets in Commanders a Reverence , but Flamiliaritie Contempt : for an affable compassion  327 leaves many times a deeper impression in a Souldiers heart, then any other booty or benefit. Alexander , when hee had his Head-piece of water ministred unto him, would not drinke himselfe, but offered it to his Souldiers; which could not chuse but worke a strange effect in them; when thirst (held the extreamest Suffering in Nature) could not so annoy him, but that the affection hee bare to his Souldiers wrought such compassionate Effects in him, as he neglected himselfe to refresh them. Cowardise likewise in a Commander clips his wings, that hee can never mount to a Conquerour.  328 There is ever (saith sententious Salust ) most danger accompanying his fight, whose heart is most surpriz'd with feare. Whereas, Courage is a Countermure against all Assailants. Neither Place nor Friend can afford a Shrowd , where Armes cannot present a Shield. Lastly (to runne over all these cursorily) that pernicious baine to all humane brood, filthy  329 thy Avarice , many times no lesse prejudiceth the Regiment hee commands, then it ruines himselfe, and brings a shamefull Defeate to his Designes: This felt Manius Acilius from the hand of Mithridates ; when by receiving Bribes, hee lay a dishonour on his Countrey, death to himselfe, and to his dying Name a living Infamy. Many Examples wee have of the like, where the nature of the Agent ill affected, crossed not onely the successe of hopefull designes, but buried their Names in oblivion; of such I speake, as have beene interested in the like adventures. As sometimes where the Agents have beene  330 neglectfull of Religion; depending more upon their owne proper resolutions, then the power of Heaven directing all humane affaires to their appointed ends: As wee may reade in  331 that memorable disaster of the Romanes at Cann ae , where the Consull Varro , with a populous Army of experienc'd Souldiers, was utterly discomfited; and that (as the Romane Historians have observed) because of Iunoes wrath conceived against Varro , for erecting (in derision of Inpiters Temple) a Mimick-boy to keepe watch, as the solemne order was. The like of Potitius , detracting from the honour of Hercules : The like revenge inflicted on Virilius by Æ sculapius : By Iuno Lacinian , on 332 Q. Fulv : By Proserpine , on Plenimius : By Iupiter , on that sacriligious Tyrant Dionysius : On Alexander , by Ceres : But wisely prevented with the presenting of a golden Goblet to Apollo , by the Pirate- Prince Thymasithius. Sometimes by the libidinous disposition of the Governour, other sometimes by his Avarice: now and then by his Impatience, and most of all by his recklesnesse, have the sequels of things proved lesse fortunate, because the precedent motives, or instruments directing to the end, had no better likely hoods in them. Wee wonder not at all, to see troubled water come from an uncleere Spring: Nor at tares growing in the sluggards field; but wee admire successive ends, drawne from improbable causes. Many times there bee (I confesse) intrinsecall motives, which like, as that Beauty is the best which cannot bee expressed by the Painter, so arrogates it the chiefest place (that inwardly moving cause, I meane) because, the efficient cause of causes, more sure, more infallible then the evidentest demonstration: And I have (for my part) ever superstitiously feared  333 to bring such causes in Question: since such Arguments have ministred no small occasion to the prophaner wits, both of Ancient and Moderne times, to boulster their insufficient opinions: As to argue thus: Heere we see a flourishing Common-weale, supporting her selfe by no other meanes then Iustice; reaching to as high a perfection in every degree, of as exact Government, as the blindnesse of the time would permit: yet this State (so flourishing) layd wast by a people exposed to all Impieties: Heere the end can hardly bee collected by the fore-going Cause. Equity was in the conquered, Tyrannie in the Conquerour: Here is a maine discrepancy in the beginning, & conclusion; and the active causes ordinarily moving seeme ( Cardine Verso ) to oppose themselves. It is true; But tell me (who soever thou art) that Lucian , like composest this Argument: Is hee that sets, and confounds, what Empires as best pleaseth him, tyed to meanes, or secondary causes? There is no Realme which for some abuse or other, hath not deserved to loose her glory; and herein doth the Majestick power of Heaven shew aboundant mercy, to some Kingdomes in chastising them before they come to the heighth of sinne, that there eclypse of glory, might bee an increase unto them of vertue; their ebbe of Honour, an occasion of acknowledgement of their Creator. 334 For even in the best Common-weales, wee reade, that the experiment of some externall misery or disaster, hath reduced them to more ripe consideration of themselves, and an exact search in themselves, discussing the causes of the Gods indignation against them. Present extremities are of that force to Humane bodies, that the present apprehension of their woe, seemes in some sort to extenuate their pride, inflameth Religion, exciteth men to undertake a labour for the benefit of their Countrey (with the losse of themselves) to appease the wrath of the Gods. This was the cause why the Romans used to have the gate of the Temple Ianus open in Warre, but shut in Peace: For Necessity (as well in these times as in Pagan times) useth to be the motiue of devotion. To inlarge which point, we may safely avouch, because it agrees with the doctrine of  335 the time; that Sanctuaries are never well frequented, but when danger approcheth. Calme Seas beget in the Mariner quiet sleepes, stiffe knees, deepe healths. The Husbandman flyes to devotion in a drought; that he may receiue Showers. Againe, after too much raine hee prayes for drought. But where's his Oblation, after he h'as received the benefit of his petition? Hee feedes on the Acorne , but never lookes to that Tree from whence it falls. In a great Plague or Mortality, what divine Lectures, devou[illeg.] Prayers, religious Fasts are every where commanded, and with what seemely obedience observed? But when the raine is past, the plague ceas't, God appeas't; we close the Blessing with a prayer or two of Thanksgiving, and then returne to our former course of Living. Sanctuaries are not to be so frequented; we are not onely to offer up our prayers in the time of danger, that we may be delivered; but continue our Thanksgivings after our delivery, that we may be hereafter preserved. Feare will supple the most insensible Atheist , and enforce him to prayer. If Festus heare but 336 of judgement , he will tremble; if Callgula heare but the noise of Thunder, he will shudder: Or creepe under his bed (poore imperiall dust) to finde a shelter. Wherein are we better, if onely feare of Gods judgements force us to prayer? When Delinquents are had in pursuit, they flye (if opportunity be offered them) to the Temple; not to pray, but least they should become a prey to their pursuers: So it fares with most of us, when these Pursivants of The Great Kings (I meane his Iudgements) follow us at the heeles; how gladly would we haue the Temple open to receiueus; to avoide those judgements that pursue us? But that Delinquent is never truly penitent, who takes Sanctuarie onely for feare of punishment. The Antients had their Asyla ; their places of refuge to flye to in their distresse. Sanctuaries (as they styled them) these had; while one flyes to Naxos , another to Lemnos , this to Paphos , that to Lesbos . And high impiety was it held to hale any with violent hand from those Sacred places. Though these Sanctuaries by the policy of after-times, were held fitting to be suppressed, that the abuse of those immunities might be removed. Now to requite their Gods for their supposed delivery; there was no Temple to which they retired, but they offered some Present or other to that God, whereto that Temple was dedicated. Nay, the very high-way-man, who made Pillage his vocation, Rapine his calling, would not be  337 behind with his Offering. Laverna must haue his Sacrifice; hoping, if his actions should come to the tesh, that those thankfull Presents would not be forgotten, but render him succour in the time of danger. These may seeme to out-strip us, though in divine knowledge Sphear'd below us. These prayed and offered before they needed; Wee never till then when danger is visibly imminent. Bee it our constant resolve, when the doores of our materiall Temples are shut, to haue the doores of our spirituall Temples open. Bee it our highest prize to offer up unto him the Sacrifice of a contrite heart, and distreaming Eyes; To whom both before and after our delivery, is to be ascribed all praise. Explanation of Causes, is an elucidary or exemplifying, as it were, of the matter whereon we entreate: Happy (saith the Poet) is hee, that hath knowne, or doth know, the principall 338 causes of things, as well preceedent as subsequent : Events may be knowne (I confesse) without their causes, but so defectiue is that knowledge, as the Countrey Shep heards prediction is of weather: His observances are Causelesse, because Artlesse; judging of the Cloud (by vsuall approbation)  & making experiment his ground, without recourse had to Naturall causes: To shew the destruction of Troy by Alcydes , without explaining the persidious dealing of Laomedon : or of Troyes second subversion, without the rape of Hellen : or of Romes translated Aristocracy, without relation made of those civill Warres, planting C aesar in his Monarchy; or of that ample and potent Empire of Media translated to the Persians , without the preceedent causes arising from the glory, and eternall renowne, of Cyrus ; would make a confused History, as  339 if the former Chaos were reduced to her first indigestion: Causes are the Springs of Events. If we should reade the divers effects of glory, the sundry moving causes of perpetuall honour, amongst the Romanes , we would admire them: Some having raised themselves to an exceeding eminent pitch of greatnesse, and that by as vnaccustomed meanes, Selfe-affiance , or Confidence of their owne valour , instanced in One Scipio : publiquely proclaiming: That, Nothing was more generous then this Confidence, more infallible then Prediction, more powerfull then celerity in dispatch, or more eminent 340 then the dignity of the Person  : The like of Scipio Æ milianus, Scipio Nasica, Furius phylus, Luc. Crassus, M. Scaurus . And many others, whose greatest fame was purchased by that meane, which useth to be the greatest errour in humane society; Selfe-conceit of a mans owne deservings : Which, likewise, hath beene ruine to many populous and most puissant Empires. Then to divert our eye to an opposite of Conceit, and that is Modesty, or a silent shadowing of their owne demerits: Excellent and memorable Examples whereof may bee produced out of Valerius Maximus in his 4 th Booke, entreating of Modesty: Where hee observes (by way of explanation) the meriting parts of many, whose resolutions shadowed, made the lustre of their Countrey more eminent. These were such, who cared little for divulging their owne fame, so they might by their Actions gaine their countrey renowne. Likewise to describe, the strange, and unexpected rising of some, Qui posteris fuere Nobilitatis initium, virtutis exemplum : Borne of nothing; yet by some private endowments, either of insinuating, as the ignoble wits: or of State-observing, as those elated Natures, grieved (as it were) with the obscurity of their Birth, in seeing others lesse (it may bee) meritorious, ascend the Throne of highest honours; possesse the eminentest places; in contempt  341 and despite of Fortune, and humblenesse of Birth, crowde in the presse of the Honoured, if but for enobling their Countrey by their peculiar deserts. This was objected against Cicero , which he as sufficiently answered: Satius est me meis rebus gestis florere, qu am majorum opinioni niti . Dependence of Ancestors conterre small or no glory to us, if our succeeding worth shew not a correspondency to our Predecessours glory. Tullus Hostilius, Tarquin ius Priscus, Tullius Servius, Perpenna , and Terentius Varro , and that mirror of Countries loue, M. Portius Cato : Their Births ignoble, yet they made their Cradles noble by their many deserving parts; Characters of proper Nobility, not derived from their fathers greatnesse, but from their owne eminence. Nor haue there wanted others who degenerated from their Ancestors well-deserved Liues: Scipio Affrican , his Countreyes honour, leaues a Scipio the Monument of his owne dishonour: Fabius Maximus , a Sonne, for worthlesse respect, deserving the name of Fabius Minimus: Clandius Pulcher beautified with ornaments of mind, as well as body, makes 342 his Countrey no lesse hopelesse by his birth, then renowned by himselfe. The like of Hortensius his Nephew, one least equalling so many deserved parts of his thrice glorious Ancestour: The one a professed prostitute to all licentious places, an arch-protector of Sensuality, having no other Clients, but noted Strumpets: The other a supporter of Equity, a resister of indirect proceedings, a mirror of continence in his time; and one, second to none, saue Cicero , in promptnesse of Speech, and a present modestly-composed Eloquence. The like of Choranius a Roman Pretor, one of confirmed gravity and approved conversation; yet left he a Sonne exposed to a prodigall course, and of an unnaturall disposition. For Excellencies in this kinde, as many, no question, have beene by the injurie of time obscured, whose Names deserved much  343 honour: So some haue bene so highly beholden to the Commendation of time, as they received as much honour to the full, as they deserved. For it were a rare and unexemplary Age, to finde all mens demerits equally ballanced. Some have found fame breathing from those Actions, which never exprest worth: whilest other, from exploits of higher worth, never received fame. But to descend to the praise of such who raise  344 a Family by their owne demerits: The Ground of this advancement ariseth generally fro these three degrees: The Gowne , the Sword , or some Mechanick Art . For the first, because that Prince of Oratory giues it priority , wee will speake of Gowne : And of such, as haue raised their Houses from nothing, by excelling in Elegancy of Speech, mannaging of judiciall. Causes, and streeing State-affaires; being held fit for their knowne abilities to be imployed that way. Of this sort, amongst the Athenians we finde Demosthenes, Ælschines, Isocrates and Lysias. Amongst the Romans, Carbo, Latus, Scipio 345 Affricanus, Galba, Servins, Sulpitius, Cotta, Gracchus, M. Antonius, Crassus, Cicero, Salustius. Amongst which there was ever some private Emulation: For Fame can endure no Corrivals. So as, their very publique pleadings were not freed from their Chidings. Demosthenes a plausive and powerfull Orator , having beene twitted and bitterly reproved by Æ schines for delivering in his Orations certaine unusuall words, answered him; The fortunes of Greece depended not upon them . One taxed another of Effeminacy ; an other, his Opposite of too much Singularity ; The third,  346 his Corrivall of Popularity . Immoderate was the hate, unextinguishible the heate betwixt Cicero and Salust : So as, the one could not come into the presence of the other without passion. For as they were unequall in their descents , so were they equally addrest to entertaine all occasions of distast. Whence we may conclude, that Wits bearing one levell, doe seldome agree in the maine building. So as, that may serue for a Maxim , what the merry Critick sometimes spake in jeast: A Cat with a Mouse , Two Cocks together in one house, and two Sister-inlawes together dwelling, can never liue without dissention. No more, two Eminent wits in one place ; but they must shew their Spirits either vpon the By or Maine . But to our former proposition; if we shall but peruse the Lives of many of those eminent Orators, Athenian & Roman pleaders ; wee shall find their beginnings obscure; their Meanes of rising small; and for their outward parts weakely promising: yet, by their inward abilities they became a glory to their Countrey; a renowne to themselves and their surviving posterity. This it was, that made Aristotle , that honour of Stagyra , so gracefull in the sight of Alexander : who, as he had Homer in all reverence for his heroicall Compositions; So had he this Stagyrian for Philosophicall Speculation. 347 This it was, that made Socrates so deare to Alcibiades . This it was, that made the workes of Zenophon so familiar to Affrican. Athenodorus his Annals to Octavian. Iosephus his incomparable Relations to Constantine. But to adde one attribute more to the glory of those famous Orators before expressed: their strength and deserving height of Spirit merited no lesse approvement; when, in their Opposition to the greatest Enemies of State, they stood constant for the liberty of their Countrey, and suppressing all such (were they never so powerfull) as fished in troubled Waters , or inclined to mutiny. So ready were their Tongues to defend by pleading; So stout were their Spirits to represse Commotion: that as they delivered their minds by the one, So they were resolved to Sacrifice their Lives, to manifest to the World that they were not defectiue in the other. In these times pleaded Merit in the Court of Iustice.  348 Corruption was a stranger to the hand or heart of a Counsellour. Hee would not be seene in a Cause that would not beare weight; Nor interesse himselfe in ought that might not conduce to the benefit of the State. Their just designes aymed neither at publique fame, nor private safety; directing the whole bent of their Councels to the improvement and security of their Countrey. In that Epitome of L. Florus collected from Tilus Livius , we shall reade what natiue Enmity was ever conceived against such as corrupted justice, by people of all qualities: and this we shal find exemplifi'd in an Act of a Tragicall nature. Bloody (sayes the Epitomizer of that noble History) was the slaughter which was made by the Germans upon their revolt from the Roman Empire , through the shady Woods and plashy marishes; nothing more intolerable then the insultings of the Barbarous , specially against the pleaders at the Barre, plucking out the eyes of some, and lopping off the hands of other some; One had his mouth stitcht up, after his tongue was first cut  349 out, which the Savage Actor grasping in his hand, sayd to it: Thou viper, at last giue over hissing . So did M. Antonies wife use Tullies tongue after his death, for pleading so boldly, and inveying so freely against her Husband in his life. But these cruelties may be properly referred to the Savage disposition of an insulting people: Which, having got an usurped Authority into their owne hand, runne in a licentious liberty, to commit all Barbarisme : punishing the Offender, before they ever examined the quality of his offence. But to discourse of the Civill government of the Romans , during their Democracy , as they were then Commanders of all neighbouring Nations: So they delighted in nothing more then advancing such, who employed their tongues or penns in defence of the publique liberty: bestowing not onely Titles on them, well suting their demerits; but preferments too, to recompence their Service. This might be instanced in the Eminentst families that flourished amongst them in those times. For so thankfull was that victorious State to deserving men, as they held it not sufficient to bestow on them gracefull trophies  & triumphs to honour them, living: but to erect Monuments in their Statuaries and Pulvinars , to their memory, dying. The like honour conferred the Athenians upon their Consuls, Orators and Philosophers. So the Ephori among the Spartans (being the same that the Tribunes were among the Romans ) were elected not in respect of their descent but of their desert: which made a flourishing State; seeing, there was none, were he never so ignoble by birth, but he received grace, if his inward abilities deserved such respect. Nor were these meanes of advancement  350 onely conferred on the Gowne ; The Martiallist had his place as well as the Mercurist Were hee never so meane a Plebeian , if hee deserved honour; he was sure to haue it. If he were the first that mounted the Wall , he had a Coronet reserved for him. Were he the first that presented himselfe in the Siege ; or in a single Combat disarmed, and so surprized any Enemy ; or enter'd first the Enemies Tent ; or in any Sea-fight enter'd his Ship ; hee was sure to receiue his Guerdon. And if the honour of his Actions deserved any such eminent reward, hee was to come home in Triumph , for the reputation he had done unto his Countrey. Where it was usuall for those Persons, who were most eminent in the eye of the State to meet him in the way, and in all solemne and triumphant manner to conduct him to the Citty, with an ample relation of his fame, to beget a glorious enuy or emulation in his posterty. Many of meanest ranke, by the noblenesse of their Spirits attained this honour. The State made no inquiry after their descents. Those they held worthiest of honour, who acquired it by Learning or Valour. Memorable is the resolution of those Mysian Captaines, who stepping out before the Roman Armie, pray'd silence, and said; Who are yee ? Answer was made; Wee are Lords of the World . They replide, Yee may well say so, if you Conquer us . What rewards were bestowed on these for their approved Valour, we reade not in the History; but no doubt such deserving Spirits could not in a Civill State liue ungratifi'de, not dye unrecorded. Hence it was, that Hiero that stout Syracusan , would have dyed in the ashes of his Country: so well deserved he of it; it so well of him. Death was accounted a light suffering, to improve her her honour, from whom they had their being. They conceited of what weake Supporters, poore man stood; his breath, how soone vading; his glory, how soone declining: The whole Fabricke of his Fortunes, how soone shaking and shrinking. But Fame gain'd by glorious actions, they found to bee of more perpetuity. Nor could they esteeme any action more truely deserving, than that which requited her love, from whom themselves and predecessors had received life. Yea, they considered what advancement they had received from an obscure Family; how should they then doe lesse than embarke themselves for all extreames, to requite the love of so endeared a Countrey? Lastly, many Families have raised their beginnings from Mechanick Arts, Sciences, and Mysteries.  351 This may be quickly gathered by the names of some Romans aswel as other Nations; who reteine to this day their appellations from their former Manuall professions. As the Family of the Pictors, from Painters; of the Pistors, from Bakers; of the Figuli, from Potters: with many others. And these in continuance of time, came to be eminent Families, drowning their first beginnings in the depth of their greatnesse. Yet in all those Liberall , with these Mechanicall Sciences; as there were thriving dispositions to advance Families forth of dust; So there were others, who even to dust reduced their advanced Families. Some apt to improve themselves forth of nothing; others no lesse ready to bring their Fathers improvements to nothing. In the inscriptions of their Natures we include the causes of their ends; vertue being (as we said before) ever seconded with event answerable to her intent, either in the beginning, middle, or end. And certainly, whosoever should but read the desolations of the mightiest Empires, or their rising, shall see some appearance of causes proceeding from their government, occasions of their glory, or ruine. Nor can we (without cause) admire the erection and establishing  352 of the Turkish Empire, her many dilated Provinces, extended Confines; and almost Soveraigne command in the Easterne parts. Let us but consider their politick government, subjecting all Lawes of Conscience, or Religion, to the furthering of their designes; planting their seat (maugre the fury of all opponents) in those floury and spacious territories, where once the sanctified feete of the sacred Apostles used to tread. Yet in their policies (because not proportionate to vertue) shall they bee subverted. They have erected themselves to an exceeding height, (with the Gyants menacing the fabricke of heaven;) but their fall will be more miserable, by how much they be of miseries more incapable. For that Kingdome which is not established  353 in peace, shall be ruined by warre; and where vertue had not her predominance, there shall the illimited rage of vice take her residence: and where shee is an inhabitant, there is imminent desolation menaced. To make explanation of causes in this, were needlesse, because the Seate of such a government is the occasion of her fall; For ruine and extirpation have ever followed Impious Governours at the heeles. Yet in making use of this especiall Branch of History: Explanation of the discovery of causes , I will limit and restraine it to an assertaine bound. We must not search causes above their Natures, there be many hidden and concealed reasons, which to enquire after were unlawfull; much  354 lesse to wade into the secret conventions of that sacred Power, from whom all visible and apparant causes borrow their light. What we may gather by authentick relation, or probable imagination, may without prejudice, or errour, be produced. As for supernaturall causes, the more we sound them, the more we sound into the shallownesse of our owne judgements; never further from apprehending them, than when we seeme to apprehend them. This inscrutable depth He well observed, who being demaunded what God was , required some  355 time to resolve that question. And still the longer he thought of it, the farther he was from it. So as, in the end he affoiled this demaund with a new question. "Friend, you have imposed me a taske, and I have studied how to resolve it: And my desire is to injoyne you an other, I  356 pray you assoile it. What is it, sayd he: how long would it be ere you should draine the Ocean dry with a Sive? Why? never, (sayd he.) Nor shall I ever (replied he) returne an answer to your question. I demaunded of you some time, but an Eternity of time will never resolve it: being farther of at this time, then when I first required time. Our usefullst and best knowledge in these Divine Secrecies, consists in the acknowledgment  357 of our owne weaknesse. We have many of our Artists some-thing too familiar with these privacies: prying too curiously into the Sealed Cabinet of Gods Councell. Sublunary things are too low Objects for their knowledge. They must shine in an higher Spheare. These can positively speake (as if inspired with some extraordinary illumination) when the World shall be dissolved. Nor ground they their assertions on conjectures (if you may beleeve them) all is apparent to them, as if they were presented in a perspective glasse. Geometricians and Astrologers affirme, as those who have measured Hell, Earth , and Heaven with their Dimensions, Proportions, Poizes, and Astrolabes; that Hell containes in Compasse seaven thousand, eight hundred and sixty five thousand Miles: In depth or Latitude, two thousand, five hundred and five Miles: In distance from us, three thousand, sixe hundred and fifty eight miles. But the World , which we inhabit, that is, the whole Earth, they say it containes in greatnesse thirty thousand, and a thousand five hundred Miles: and in Latitude or profundity, that is, from the Antipodes unto us, ten thousand and twenty two Miles. Then, that the Empyrean Heaven , which is the place of the Blessed, they say it containes in compasse ( o immensity !) ten thousand, three hundred and foureteene Millions, eighty five thousand, and sixe hundred ten miles: in depth or latitude, three thousand sixe hundred Millions of Miles. And betwixt us and this Heaven, in distance one thousand sixe hundred ninty Millions, nine hundred twenty five thousand, and five hundred Miles. But this may be supposed far above the compasse of their Iacobs-staffe Their eyes, I conceive, to be  358 too weake to pierce into the Mansions of Heaven. Lower Dimensions are fitter for the strait circumference of their understanding. The way to measure Heaven, is to decline from Earth; and to elevate our thoughts to that Caelestiall Spheare, where we may gloriously shine and Eternally rest. He is the best Astrologer, who converseth more with Heaven in Spirituall affections, then instrumentall dimensions: who becomes more familiar with Heaven, by his elevation of piercing thoughts, then prying eyes. This that learned Euclid well observed, when being asked a saucy question touching the Divine Presence, by too curious or in quisitive a Questionist, modestly answered: " For other things I know but little, thus much I know, that the Gods hate those that are curious. This that Divine Father (the glory of the Easterne  359 Church) with much spirituall zeale expressed, when being on a time asked; " What God did before he made the world , answered him home: He was preparing Hell for such as Hee, who too curiously pried into his Secrets. The only way to rectifie this Errour, is for man  360 to descend into himselfe. For then upon acknowledgement of his owne vilenesse, he will let fall his Traine: humble himselfe in the consideration of his owne wants: and close his resolves with this conclusion: "Thus much I know, that I know nothing: how then should I dare to aspire with too curious an eye, to looke into his Secrets, who made all things of nothing? Now to the third, that is, judgement in distinguishing things, by approving the best, and disallowing the contrary. Dijudication of Histories, or judgement in distinguishing  361 the approvedest, proceedes from a mature understanding. In this Historicall Scale we must banish all lacivious and petulant wits, conversant about froathy and licentious obscenities. The Workes of an Historian should be Monuments of Antiquity, true Heralds of Acts; either prosperously, or insuccessively atchieved: and not foments to lust, inducements to sensuality. Two sorts there be which eclypsean Historians glory: from the one  362 we reape the harvest of shame, where characters of Myrrah , and Venus (the wantons votaries) are deblazoned in their colours: yet in their descriptions more pernitious to easily-inclined youth,  363 than ever Archilochus was to the Spartan dames. Poore Albion hath laboured too long of this impostume; such Historians must either be exiled, or the Common-wealth must of necessity bee depraved. Vice hath too many supporters, without the furtherance of Authors. From the other,  364 there redounds no other benefit, than impertinent inquisitions of strangely- sought out Antiquities; so precise in description, so curious in foundation, and so selfe-opinionate of their owne writings, as they oft-times doe onely ( H aererein verbis ) omitting the Substance to set out (with Phydias ) the shadow: search of a fruitlesse Antiquity, occasioning a contempt in the body of the History. As in the foundation of a City, neglecting the materiallest parts of the discourse; as upon what occasion the City was rather erected there, than in another place; by what meanes it was augmented, how continued; and other necessary circumstances omitted; they insist upon affaires of lesse consequence; finding out where the first stone was laid, when the foundation of such a City was digged. This causes often-times great Volumes, with small benefit to the Reader; and indeede rather implies an affecting-opinion in the Author, of pleasing himselfe, than others. Ancient Records are necessarily inserted in Histories; but such are to be supported by truth, including a necessary relation to the Subject whereof he intreats. Otherwise, such Antiquities (as for selfe-pleasing) are produced, expresse nothing. Pr aeter plebcium & inutilem quendam opinionis succum . These be rather opinionists than Historians. These two kindes (like Ianus face) stand contrary-waies: the one sort (to wit the first) are Charons best Factors, they trafficke for a Ladies bonvoyage to hell; theres not a line in all their writings, that tastes of modesty, or relish of vertue: If Pluto and his Angels had not one she- Prophet, nor State-moppet within all his dominions, to make his Empire Noble: yet these Brothell-Authors (for better I cannot name them) would by their Lime-twigges, furnish his ( Malasperanza ) with a full saile. My Lady here sits and reads wonders at the ingenuity of the man, (a pregnant youth doubtlesse,) and will make her pregnant too, if shee have any moving faculty in her; his best character is the Schoole-master of folly, the introducer of sensuall liberty, extinguisher of pure love, experienced instructer to lust, harbourer of illimited desires; and consequently harbenger to the Divell. As the Martin will not build, but in faire houses, so this man will not live, but in the ruines of honour: he is too conversant in the Court, too familiar in the City, and sometimes too willingly entertained in the Countrey. His Penne, as it is mercinary, so his labours pernitious; his state labours of penury (and he would raise it) his soule of a Lethargy, but seeks not to redeeme it. To be briefe (for such a Subject is not worthy dilating on;) As Augustus banished Naso to Naxos , and his depraved workes to the darkest corner of his study: so should these petulant Wits be expulsed every well-governed Common-weale, and their prostitute Labours sustaine Eupolis censure. How highly other States have suffered in giving  365 too much liberty to these unseasoned wits, might be amply enlarged, if our present discourse requir'd it. No doubt but Rome , even in her highest glory, when nothing but Successe breathed on her attempts abroad, and private affaires at home: Then, and never more than at that time, were light and wanton workes, which a civill Estate should have proscribed, highly honoured, the Authors of those Motives to effeminacy advanced; whereas, if their Censors had duely intended their charge, they would have held them fitting to have beene exiled, their workes to fire committed. So might that corruption of manners, which proceedes oftimes from such vicious Pamphletters, have beene prevented: and Morality better observed. But why should we looke so farre backe, when we labour of the like malady at home: what high Patrons have present ages found for lightest Labours? where such as corrupted youth, received more approvement, then those who corrected the loosenesse of affections. It was a good Custome, when such Authors as published any Workes, had them not onely censoriously perused and scanned, but if it appeared, that they contayned in them more occasions of prejudice to the State then benefit; those Workes were not onely to be suppressed, but the Composers of them duly censured. Their manner of proceeding was thus: Such passages as were usefull, or any way beneficiall, were in papers piece-meale, layd upon one pile: Those which were noxious or malignant, bestowed on an other pile: and both these put in two Scales: where if those of the right handpile (which ever conduced to the improvement of the State) weighed downe those papers which were on the left- hand pile, their Labours were permitted to passe, and their Authors, according to the quality of that Subject, whereof they wrote, amply rewarded: If otherwise, their Workes were suppressed, and their Authors chastised. In which Scrutine, no question, but many Authors had Batillus fate; they received more fillups then Crownes; more censures then rewards. 366 The opinion of a serious and discreete judgement ever closeth in this: Learning never but then deserves the Laurell, when it is vertuously fruitfull. A light Dresse, be it never so neatly suited, carryes ever lightnesse with it. And the more it takes a deluded eye, though it please it selfe, the more it detracts from it selfe. The like we may say of these Venders, or bold adventurers of loose Labours. Be they never so trimly decked, nor artfully polished; La is will be La is still. The trimming will not alter the property of the stuffe. Nor can lightnesse, bee it never so smoothly carried; neatly varnished; nor cunningly palliated; keepe her Vizard still on. There will be some piercing judgement or other to bring to discovery a shrouded errour. Nor deserve those Workes onely reproofe, who treat of light love; (though they be dangerous Familiars to haunt Ladies) but such who are tuned to an higher key, and either unprofitably, or which is worse, prophanely abuse their captiv'd Hearers. Amongst these, may be numbred our Chymick Professors: who hold it not sufficient (by strange  367 Elixirs ) to reduce their owne fortunes to nothing; unlesse they with their miserable conclusions, perplexe their simple admirers. Where, if a cleare- discerning judgement should take a more exact view of their ungrounded reasons, they would soone conclude, that those arguments which they offer, not unlike their adulterate Metals, are soulder'd with Amalga , and have more Moone than Sunne in them. These have got a tricke to slight all miracles of Divine Writte: holding with Albumazar , that Moses his leading the Children of Israel over the Red-Sea, was no more but observing the influence of the Starres, and waining season of the Moone that withdraweth the Tides. These are Subjects so incapable of priviledge, as they deserve the highest censure. I spare to speake of our Statizing Pamphletters, who shadowingly (to free themselves from State-scandall) deblazon some eminent Families by their Armes, Coate, or Fields: for which, some both Ancient and Moderne Historians have beene highly taxed. As likewise of such, who under borrowed names have strucke at high Personages: which might be aptly compared to cowardly Curres, who use to bite Passengers by the heeles, whom they dare not looke upon in the face. 368 As such who delight to ungorge their passionate spleane upon Recreations of indifferency , for no other cause, but because they are countenanc'd by Majesty . The last, being not the least, I account such, who spend much precious  369 Oyle to enwreath and enwarpe the time  370 in their Fopperies. These are Controversiall Men, who rather than they will suffer the Church to be at Peace; will study new doubts  371 to disturbe her quiet. These will rather stirre than stay quarrels: for, howsoever they seeme to pretend Unity; their affection tends to dissention: being of the slimy nature of such Fishes, as cannot live but in muddy and troubled waters. That word Nisi in this sentence, nisi manducaveritis carnem , set all the Counsell of Basil in an uprore. That word Donec , as Ioseph non agnovit Vxorem suam Donec , caused the Antidicomaritans and Elusians to deny the perpetuall Virginity of the Virgin Mary. Thus quicke-fiery wits, carryed away with the spirit of Contradiction, preferring Singularity before Conscience, Errour before Truth, so they may finde Shadowes to follow them, will finde cumbustible matter enough to the havocke both of Church and Commonweale: Not onely our Humane but Ecclesiasticall Histories are stored with various instances of this kinde. The Scope we aime at, is this: that such Workes, whether they be Historicall, Morall or Divine, are onely, upon Censure to be approved, by which the State may be usefully improved: all others to be rejected, because they are either by Scurrilous or Factious Braine-wormes hatched. For the other, as none yeeld or afford more benefit to their Countrey, than laborious and judicious Antiquaries: so trifling and opinionately-conceited Historians may benefit themselves, but hardly can communicate the best of their knowledge unto others. Opinion is a maine Opponent to Judgment: the one guided (or rather drawne) by a precipitate will, the other disposed by the directing eye of Reason. Opinion ( Lesbian -like) frames their Line by their workes, and not their worke by their line: but Judgment hath ever ( Cleanthes -like) a Table equally mixed  372 or furnished with services of Arete & Pomona , Vertue and Pleasure: the one to profit, the other to delight: Which equally- mixed Judgment should be especially conversant in Censurers of Histories, they must not doe, as it is reported of Valerius Maximus , inhibite many things in the Evening, which hee would approve of in the Morning, and command that to be enacted one houre, which he would be ashamed to confirme the next houre. A setled and wel-seasoned judgment will with Circumspection, not so much censure a modest digression in a History, as the use which may be made of that digression; nor taxe any thing in a faithfull Historian, though he shadow at the corruptions of the Age with bitternesse: for oyly and temporizing tongues, are  373 nourishers of these vicious and irregular times; where, as Beasts in the Desart, so men live in the  374 World: nor be Censurers to taxe such things for impossibilities, because they have not heard of the like; nor such Relations as false, which have not occurred to their readings. For how should wee give credit to those incredible attempts of former times, where Victories were atchieved with lesse adoe, than May-games in these times? To see Anth aem renewing his strength, and doubling his force by falling: those magnanimous Romans erecting their spirits most when they were nearest declining. I have ever observed these times, as they second the first in gradation, so they stand inferiour to the first in exploits and managements of resolution. Censures should be ballances equally and evenly disposed; neither inclining to partiall affectation of person or state; but ready to give approbation where the verity of Discourse, and sincerity of the Author gives his Pen free scope to curbe Errour, and attribute to Vertue her merited Titles. Alas, that Censurers should be either so engaged to the servile command of popular glory, or tyed to great mens sleeves, that the Historians Labours must be razed, which Truth would have raised! Vertue hath in her selfe a soveraigne end, to which all Liberall Arts and Sciences (in themselves truely noble, and meriting honour) have their aime and recourse. This occasions Learning to be neglected, and the exact scrutinie of ancient Records (than the which nothing more beneficiall) to be suppressed, or at least, not a little darkned: when a Rhadamanth , or Critick Censurer must have the corrections of our industrious Labours, and judicious Volumes: which (to feed his owne indigested humour) must be subject to many frivolous interlacings. But Patience (which is Comes sapienti ae, 375 non famula concupiscentia ) must be the poore Historians supporter, making use of times abuse, and applying this salve to his misery, which the Po et inferred, as cause of Romes subversion and calamity: Primaperegrinos obscanapecunia mores intulit \---  376 That Critick Menippus , who was ever so definite in his owne opinion, as the whole course of his discourse relished nothing better then opposition. And to affront the Time wherein hee 377 lived, with more boldnesse, scorning to comply eyther with Time or Person for his owne advantage, wished, like an indiscreet Malecontent , that his Pen were a Needle , and his Paper a Nettle ; yea, and his Inke Aconitum , that hee might throw more poyson on the face of immerited honour: and consequently, leave to posterity surviving stamps of his invective nature: would sometimes use, amongst other subjects of his discontent, to take occasion to fall upon a free reproofe of rigid Censurers : whose judgement (as his mis-guided opinion suggested) only consisted in razing Labours, and disheartning Authors: while their innocentst lines were oft mis-construed, their sense corrupted. But this waspish Author by using his too much freedome of censure to his Censurer, who had authority to peruse and suppresse, where hee found cause, perceiving himselfe traduced, deservingly restrain'd what else might have beene published: with silencing only, chastising his Errour, to beget in him a more temperate censure. Truth is, it were prepostrous for an Author to assume to himselfe so much boldnesse, as to take upon him the place of a Moderator to his Censurer . The assumption of lesse liberty will suite better with his Discretion and Modesty: and purchase him a demerited esteeme with such grave and censorious Authority: whose place is so much more to be honoured, in regard they are deputed by the State as Surveyers and Discussers of our Labours: Perusing with a judicious eye, and correcting with a discreete Penne; to the end, no exception might be taken by the State , no prejudice redound to the Author , no corruption of manners to the Reader, nor opinion of neglect to the Censor. Which course, were it not duely and exactly observed, what inconvenience might probably follow, there is none of a cleare and equall judgement but may easily perceive. For if freedome were given to wanton and luxurious Wittes to write what they would, Aretines Tables would receive from every light eye more admiration for true attractive beauty, than the most Serious Piece that ever was writ either in Philosophy, Oecononicall policy, or History. No; we should have our Stationers stalls covered with Libells: where the most integrious Spirit might become no lesse subject to a Calumnious Penne, than He, whose rising growth hath exprest it selfe in nothing more from his in fancy, than in the increase of vice, and practise of villany. It is the Authority then of a Censurer, that many times deterres a wandring Penne from his freedome of errour. So as, by being regulated by such Licence , he becomes lesse licentious in the course and current of his Writing. Nay, there is one thing more, which I shall onely glance at, purposely to induce the ingenuous Author , as he values the estimate of his owne honour, to submit himselfe to the candid censure of his Licencer . And it is this; no doubt, but the too opinionate conceite of every Author complies with the positive judgement of the Orator: "Writers doe ever doate most of their owne . How needefull then is it, for them to have more indifferent eyes than their owne, lest they delude themselves most, by being too affectionately taken with their owne? The Beare is as much enamoured of her Cubbe, though of all others, the roughest; as the Bever is of his, being of all others, the smoothest. And thus much in vindication of the honour of a just Censor. And how an impartiall eye may save the Author from much dishonour. Yet to speake a word or two, so it trench not too much upon their power, I hold it not amisse. The benefit may redound no doubt, being received as it is intended, both to the Writer and Censurer. Many (which I have formerly touched and taxed) like some of our German Authors, set forth huge Colossian Bulkes, fadomelesse volumes (and if fatherlesse too, more credit to their fathers) but they have Bodies without Spirits, Videntur Libri donec inspexeris . They beare the Cover and "Semblance of Bookes on them, till you looke in them. Then, and never till then, they shew what mettall they are made of. Leane Labours, from fat Authors. It is commonly said, that Law, Logick and the Switzers may bee hired to fight for any one. Whatsoever they may bee, apparent it is, by their numerous fruitlesse Editions, that these will enter lists with any Antagonist , upon the least occasion. No Subject but must have their paines and pennes bestowed on it. Huge intricate Commentaries, to make the Text more difficult. With some of these I have encounter'd, and for ought I could perceive by the Genuine Sence of their interpretation, they were so farre from the understanding of the Author they wrote on, as they might be sent to schoole againe, to learne to conster him, before they commented on him. The like exuberance is many times showne by many of these, in their lighter composures: wherein, for most part, they offend least. For weake wits bestowed on weighty Subjects, erre most. I have heard of a trifling Pamphletter of this kinde, who after such time, as he had spent much waste Paper inventing some weake vapours of his owne; wherein he was ever no lesse constant in the choyce of his Patron to whom he Dedicated them, than he was in compiling those corky Subjects which hee addressed to him: presenting one day another light toy, his Patron having perused the Title, and divers passages in it, requited his Dedication with this witty Jeere: "Truely friend, quoth hee, you have writ many foolish toyes in your time, but of all that ever you yet writ, this passeth them all. The poore Author highly taken with this commendation, not without great joy, reported the worthy entertainment he received from his Patron: and how highly to his honour, he had commended his Labour. Now to our Censurer ; as his place inferres a priority of judgement, so I would have him to distinguish of the utility of Labours. These, who spend time, oyle and paper to purchase them the Title of Authors: let them be privatly reprov'd, in daring to present such poore stuffe before the face of a publicke State. The common English Proverbe is; "Better it is to sit idle, than worke idle . This may be properly applyed to them. Their fruitlesse expence of Time and Paper makes them farre more uselesse to the State, than if they wholly retired themselves from Labour. Truth is, these deserve no censure; they are placed in too low a Siege. A milde reprofe will better beseeme them; telling them, how by all likely-hood, if any such should be suffer'd to goe abroad; or receive priviledge by authority, the next time that either he or any of his family should goe to the Grocer for their spicery, little doubt but some of his shaken leaves would bee return'd him, with sweeter contents than ever he bestowed on them. Whereas SUCH, whose earely and late Studies have highly improved their knowledge, and whose discretion (a small graine where of would be very usefull to many of our Schollers) hath sufficiently inform'd them what is fit or accommodate for the time; be the Subjects they treate of History, Antiquity, or other Diviner Elements: these, I say, well deserve the encouragement of a judicious Censor . For the use the words of our Moderne. Democritus : "I thinke all the Anticyr ae will not restore them to their Wits, if these men now, that have Zenodotus Heart, Crates Liver, Epictetus Lanthorne, be so sottish, and have no more braines than so many Beetles, what shall we think of the Commonalty? what of the rest? you may give that Censure of them in generall, which Sr. Thomas Moore once did of Germanus Brexius Po ems in particular: \--- Vehuntur In rate stultiti ae Sylvam habitant Furiae. If Learning and Discretion be not sufficient to make up an Author; what may wee expect from him that ha's neither? Some of our Censurers have here to fore beene not unlike to some of our active Lawyers; who in perusing of their Clients pleadings, usually razed out what was most pertinent: but afterwards upon a more setled judgement, wrote STET in the Margent, to all that which they had formerly razed. Multidum castigant, castrant; dum mutant, mutilant . Many, too many, while they seeme to correct, they distract; while they alter, they torture. But approved Censors are of another nature (of which we were never better furnished in a competent number:) for these are of that true touch , as neither gaine may corrupt them, nor the Authors person worke upon them, but the worth of the worke: this onely hath power to procure a priviledge from them. But let me stay a little, that I may make an end the sooner; ere I proceed to the true distinguisher of Histories, I must caution two sorts of Men, which (in their Reading) pervent the use  378 and scope of History, by a malevolent disposition, either bred in them by nature, or ingendred by custome, a second nature: the one foolishly  379 precise, whose behaviour (as one observeth) is like a verse, wherein every sillable is measured; or like your Spaniards aspect, who will not smile beyond a point, for feare to unstarch his looke. These cannot taste any thing well, that is not absolute; yet for their judgement a Venetian Asse  380 may out-strip them: He is (unmeasurably proud) wise in his owne conceite, hath an Orbe in his braine, which ever turning round, makes his  381 judgement braine-sicke. The other, farre more intollerable, because more troubled with the rising of Spleene: hee detracteth from the best, and finds Scruples in  382 infallible truths; his owne judgement, as it is defective, so it envies others, maturer in the height of understanding, and more exact in the ancient Surveies of Truth. But as Fortitude of body derives her Essence from the imbecility of the Minde, and the ability of the Minde from the debility of the body: So the Authors glory is oft-times revived, and augmented by the sting of Detraction, as the Detractors infamy by the Authors glory: Vertue alone is crowned, Vertue  383 in her selfe, is of all possessed: She it is alone by which Man is Eternized. This is She that steeres the poore Historians Barke against all oppositions. In this Harbour therefore may I repose, leaving the depraved Reader to the distemprature of his owne humor, and betaking my selfe to my propounded Taske. We must walke in a more modest path for  384 judgment in the relation of every act that is done; we ought to use a kind of deliberation, consulting with our owne intimate understandings, and aske them whether such an Act is worthy memory, or no: for many things wee see and read, which Discretion would rather have omitted, than to Writing committed. We have occasion sometimes to unrip the tyrannick lives of Princes, and their illimited affections; of dissolute governments, and to what peculiar vices most engaged; yet in the summary rehearsall of these vices, we doe oft-times (as an excellent Historian hath well observed) Instruerematos , teach men to be evill, instructing them in the exercise of those impieties, with which before they were scarce acquainted. Vice is of that spreading and propagating nature, as no infection can more dangerously or  385 fatally rage in any populous City, than her contagion in the flourishing City of the Soule. And so proclive is our Nature to the worst, as we receive it with farre more easie impression, than that which relisheth of the best. That Italian Lover, who found his Mistresse so mutable, could in the extremity of his passion (as what passion more violent or more permanent) cry out: "Our Italian Dames had never beene acquainted with such disdaine, nor entertained their Servants with such contempt, nor rejected them with suchSelfe-content, had they not beene instructed by inconstant Cassandra to love in jeast and loath in earnest. Which implied thus much: That nothing could more prejudice either publique or private Estates, then to be fraughted with Forraine vices. Many States are best secured by intelligence ;  386 but by the knowledge of others Vices, few or none. Youth is a dangerous taking thing, and apt to be nibling at any baite that is throwne out: yea, and many of maturest judgements, whose long experience in the World, might have sufficiently inform'd them, that the hopes of-Earth are failing; the Honours of Earth fading; all the faire-flourishing promises of this empty World deceiving: Yet, hearing such an Eminent Statist in an other Country advanced, they cannot so moderate their affections, but they must expostulate with their owne over-weening Spirits; and on the silent night, when more composed minds can enjoy their freedome of rest; and allay the labours of a preceeding day with the untroubled sleepes of a succeeding night; These feele an Æ tna within them; others Triumphs become their Tortures ; others Honours their Furies. Pompey , that loyall but unfortunate Roman , being combred with his honour, and wearied with too glorious a Servitude, exclaimed to see Sylla's cruelty, being ignorant after what sort to behave himselfe in the dignity hee had; he cryes out amaine, forth of the consideration he had to an usurped Tyranny, with a serious reflexe had to humane misery: "O perill and danger never like to have end! But unconfined spirits , whose thoughts are solely sixt on a ery structures; will not suffer their aspirings to be so bounded: nor the voluptuous his sensuall affections to be so couped: nor the poore Groundling to have his Earthy-tasting appetite so sated. These, as they peruse the Mappe of the World; they cull out what may please them best; though the issue afflict them most. As to instance in each of these; The high-minded Man loves to informe himselfe in the Progresse of such Mens actions; whose aimes have beene  387 no lower then Empires. They conceive their supportance to be as great; their Meanes as direct; their wayes as smooth. Flattering and deceiving hopes lull them a sleepe; they will not so much as suffer their thoughts to converse with Feare, or labour prevention of a fall, before their practise faile. Then, and never till then, they exercise the true knowledge of Man. Then they lament, what they cannot recall; so precipitate is that cliffy tracke, where unbounded height walkes. Now observe a little, whence the Occasion springs, which with winged speed brings on these inevitable miseries! I confesse, though many dispositions be naturally inclined to these indiscreet aimes: yet are they quickned much with Examples of others. This moved a neighbouring Prince; (one, whose personall prowesse hath worthily inrolled him in the Booke of Fame) sometime to send a Noble and Eminent Personage hither; whose many arguments of Valour had gain'd him esteeme enough with his Prince (had his loyall thoughts so well deserv'd it) onely to see and observe the censure and cloze of an high Spirit. Hoping, that such ocular objects would worke strongly upon his deluded thoughts: and bring him to a consideration of himselfe by presentments of feare, what his illimited height would not suffer him to thinke upon, with all those ample gratifications of love. Most certaine it is, that the Survey of others actions produce wonderfull effects, according to the disposition of the Peruser or Spectator. For, as ill-affected spirits, who alwayes plant their hopes on unjust grounds; and bring their indirect aymes to unhappy ends: are ever dreaming of stirring heads, whose constantst endeavour it was ever to disquiet the peace of the State: and craving no better Medal's about them, then those of Bessus and Nabarzanes , mold their designes by such pernitious Patterns. So well- affected dispositions never eye ought with more attention, nor reteine ought with more constancy than the Loialty of such as preferred their Countries Fame before their owne Life: desiring rather to dye than it should perish. A constant Curtius ; a resolute Horatius ; an affectionate Zopyrus ; a couragious Codrus are these mens Objects. Their Vertues they unfainedly wish may be their Patterns. These cry out with the Tragedian: "No power so pure, as stedfast Piety. 388 Againe, to a youthfull affection, there can be no sight, in the perusall of all Plutarch , like Alcibiades wantoning in Timandra's lappe. Nor in all Suetonius , like those uncomely lascivious presentments before Nero : a thought where of could not chuse but beget a Vermillion-blush, a glowing shame in any modest eare. Which, to omit the rest, in my Judgment, were not fitting to be suffer'd to passe in any free state. Passages there are (as I have else- where noted) full of Obsc aenity: and lyes open an entrance for unstay'd Youth to feed too liberally upon such inhibited delights. Such therefore, were much better to be shadowed, than so freely discovered: Seeing, "Discovery of Vices abroad, many times instruct us in the very same 389 at home. Should two Embassadours come hither; one from Sidon , another from Tyre (as one wittily observeth) and should vye in Vanity, as they sometimes envied one anothers glory; we should collect, that no State-affaires drew them hither, but rather to shew the vanity of one Countrey to the other: Which if we our selves should admire, in very truth we were madder than either. True it is, there is nothing either in matter of Discourse, Employment, Reading; or what Recreation soever, but that soly workes upon us, which sutes with our humour, or delights us. Alexander being much in love with Apelles , as one highly rapt with the exquisitenesse of his Art, proposed him that Modell for a Taske, which he of all others affected most; commanding him on a time to paint Campaspe , a beautifull Woman, naked: Which Apelles having done, such impression wrought the Picture (an inimitable Piece in so nearly tracing Nature) on the affection of the Artist, as Apelles fell in love with her, which Alexander perceiving, gave him her. There is nothing which wee intentively eye, and by the Crany of the eye convey to our heart, but our Fancy like another Apelles , easily findes a Table for that Portraiture. Let Vertue then be our Campaspe ; otherwise, that Table which should be reserved for the purest Deity, will be taken up with the impression of some lighter Fancy. Lastly, the Earth-taken Soule, who constantly holds Avicens Aphorisme, "that Gold is the best Restorative; admires Achans Wedge; Alcm aeons Store; huggs them in the happy fruition of their state: meane time, holds Anacharses Temperance; Anacreons Moderation fitter for the Wildernesse than the World . These read nothing in this kind, but they make use of it: but the use is ever perverted. Examples they finde to authorize their basenesse: these they reteine: but little care take they how to cure them, by applying usefull Receipts to remove those spreading evills. A Masters vice corrupts his Family. 390 So sayes the Po et. No vice more retentive than vicious Writing: it corrupts the Judgment by Apologizing Vice with a forraigne President. That was an excellent Rule of Direction to regulate our forme of Speech: "If thy Speech 391 may improve others, why art thou silent? If it neither behove thy selfe nor others, why art thou not silent ? The same course is to be observed in our forme of writing: "If by our Pen we may profit  392 our selves, it is well; if some few others as well as our selves, it is better; if all, it is the best; if none, Silence enjoynes the Workman to take his rest. In one word, as some things are necessarily to be remembred, so others no lesse necessarily to be omitted. And with farre more Discretion may they in their Embrio be silenc'd by the Author; then after such time as they are published, to be supprest by Censure. That memorable Law-giver being demanded what punishment was to be inflicted on him, who should chance to slay his Father or Mother: hee answered them with, Haud equidem puto, &c . I doe not thinke there can be any of so unnaturall disposition. Acts silenced sometimes doe better than if expressed: for the Curtaine of vices drawne, moves Imitation rather than Evitation. In distinguishing also of things good and necessary from their contraries, wee should not mixe triviall Discourses in our maine Relation: they much impaire and disparage the weight of an History, distracting the Readers minde with 393 impertinencies, where the Subject might of it selfe be better prosecuted; nor can any thing shew more indiscretion in an Author, than these vagaries, where attention can no way be moved, the expectances of men satisfied, or a reall delight with profit apprehended. Attention (as that eloquent Oratornoteth) is there the quickest, where wee promise to speake of things, great, new, un- usuall; or such affaires as may conduce to the benefit of the Common-weale, to the establishing of Religion, Piety, or the like. Now such serious Discourses (in themselves grave and ponderous) are not to be mixed with every frivolous digression; the Body of the History being solid, should not depend of weake and infirme members: which might seeme to resemble the Roman Colosse, of an huge proportion in body, but feeble feet; so as one day the frame of the whole was demolished by the debility of one part. Yet in this grave and firme Composition, there must be one necessary Caveat inserted: that whensoever we draine the approbation of our Discourse (as from many, and those to our Judgment of the selected Authors) we reconcile their Opinions, and make one united Body of so many dispersed parts. This I thought to caution (as well the Histories perusers, as the generallest Collectors of) because I have observed this foule errour (and that in both Ancient and Moderne Relations) where  394 divers Authors were cited, and their severall Opinions marshalled on a row: but as in a battell, when the wings be broken, there ensueth nought but an universall confusion; so without reconcilement in the conclusion, he leaves the Reader in suspence, whose opinion to entertaine; because not directed by the Author. This implies a double defect; either from stupidity,  395 not able to distinguish; or from a pertinacy, not willing to communicate his Judgment to others. The latter is more intollerable than the first; for the one includes a native defect, (which hee would remedy if his Apprehension could better it.) The other a malicious desire of ingrossing knowledge to himselfe; though both unworthy of an Historicall place: for Ignorance deserves small entertainment in so judicious an Argument: and a perverse disposition much lesse, concealing his knowledge from his Countrey, which by his Subject (it seemes) he intended to benefit. In distinguishing likewise, we should ever observe to cull out such perspicuous Sentences, as comprehend most, yet least in affectation: for such taste ever of singularity.  396 Hortensius was called by Pythias (for his too much gesturing) a profest Mimick , a Dionysian : the same Title may be given our curious Relators: 397 they binde their Subject to their words, esteeming no discourse in it selfe worth judicious observation, but what is replenished and full fraughted with polite sentences, making the matter indebted to the superficiall Art of the Composer. You shall read in many Historians a singular  398 kinde of state, the forme and order of their Relations, observed: Neither shall you finde in that Style any such affected State, as with large Parentheses to intangle the understanding, or too much enlarge the Subject, by challenging too neare affinity with Art. The selfe same forme which sometimes that richly-enobled Mirandula commended to his, I should best approve of in these. "As I do not (saith he) require from you a forme of Speech to trimme, so I would not have it trash; as I would not have it too neate, so I would not have it too rough; as not too choice, so not too course. That unkemb'd and incompt Antiquity, he  399 could not endure. He would have Lines so taste of the Lampe, as to have a stronger relish of labour, than affectation from any other. As first, for the choice of Words , No man, unlesse he have already vow'd to converse onely with Aire, can be of so distemper'd a judgement, as to preferre a superficiall dresse of Words , before the maine Subiect whereof hee meanes to intreate. This were like one, that should addresse himselfe for some farre journey, and accommodate himselfe with all necessaries fitting for such a journall: but neglects wholly, or knowes not the bent of his Travaile whereto he goes, nor for what end. And foolish were he, who, upon perusall of such an Airy Author, that decks his Workes meerely with an outward lustre, should fall into a veine of applauding or commending him: Nor could he well have lesse reason to approve such Encomions (but rather hold them for Paradoxes ) than such, who have beene sometimes pleased to bestow their derisory praises upon the very worst or contemptiblest Subjects. After this sort, was Polycrates that famous Athenian Rhetorician pleased to fall into the praise of the Tyrant Busyris, Seneca of Claudius, Favorinus of Thersites, Maro of his Gnat, Lucianus of his Flye, Apuleius of his Asse : Againe, Favorinus of a Quartane Fever,  400 Glaucus of Injustice, Synesius of Baldnesse, Lucianus of Parasiticall Flattery, Erasmus of Folly. But truth is, praise may reflect upon the Subject that is unworthy of such praise, by way of disgrace. To commend a parcimonious man for his bounty or liberality, or a severe Judge for  401 his clemency, layes him open to the World; which makes his Commender a Satyricall Displayer: in extolling him in that respect onely, which hath begot him, to such as truely know him, a marke of ignominy. Flattery, saith one, is not alwayes to praise in presence, for ingage our selves wee may to that hatefull brand, by praising in absence; that is, when either the vertue, for which he is praised, is absent, or the occasion: as for Vertue , as she is her owne praise, her owne Princely Precident; so is her owne prize her owne praise, farre above the oyly Rhetorick of any affective Parasite. Such Words then beseeme an Historian best, which are proper and native. Such as were obsolete or out of use were much distasted of our Historians of ancient time: so as, howsoever some abstruse words may fall out now and then in the Relations of Tranquillus , which tasted too much of Calepine : no doubt, but they were in those times received for Native. Howbeit, sometimes they mainly obscure the mind of the Author. Some Arguments like wise cannot be expressed in usuall Words: unlesse the Word by which such a thing should be rendred, were dilated to a whole sentence. In such case, the Historian is to be excused; because the easinesse of this errour, is rather to the Subject than Author to be imputed. In briefe, I will conclude this with that sententious saying of the Po et: Words follow matter of their owne accord, Matter gives life and essence to the Word. Now for the Phraze ; as I have formerly proposed the best direction, that such, who have already writ of that Subject, have recommended; all the better, to imprint this in your memory; it is to be understood, that no Phraze of Speech better becomes these Relations, than such as are briefe and sententious. I have knowne some, in their Additions to certaine pleasing Inventions of our owne; by labouring to surpasse their Coppy (left imperfect, and falling into their nice hands to make compleate) through an affected Elegancy of phraze, to have darkned the meaning of the Author: by furnishing the Story with an Ocean of Words, but scarce one droppe of Reason. The Phraze then must be so disposed, that the matter whereof wee treate, must not through affectation become intangled, nor any way obscured. Wherein a great measure of discretion is required: Yea, and in one and the same History, the forme of the Phraze may be changed. Light Subjects are ever properly suited with light Lines. But when we addresse our Discourse to describe the Subversion of a State; the depopulation of any flourishing City: still from the Tragicke ashes of such a Story, may our Penns bee taught to droppe Teares. There is no representment of Sorrow that suites well in the same Habit or Colours, that Subjects of delight are to be attired in. When that Nation, our Historian hath occasion to write of, shall be cloathed in mourning garments; when fire and fury attend them without, feare and famine within: When their Weake Walls are so inclos'd about, That feare gets in, but nothing can get out. Then must his Phraze of Speech put on an heavy dresse. Elegancy never lesse beseemes him than at that time. Passionate Enter-breathes; Treaties of Sorrow; Eare-moving expostulations from those disconsolate Agents of misery, are fitting Dishes for such a bloody banquet. Benzo in his Indian Story expresseth a singular  402 Art in his discovery of Passion in this kinde; who relating the cruelty of the Spanish Nation practised upon the West Indies (if the History hold concurrence with truth) collects a Summary of all in this one presidentall report: In one of their Ilands called Hispaniola , of twenty hundred thousands, when the people stood untoucht (which had they remain'd so still, might have redounded more to the honour of that Nation) the Author was verily perswaded at the penning of his History, that there were scarce a hundred and fifty soules left; whence he exclaimed, O quot Nerones, quot Domitiani, quot Commodi, 403 quot Bassiani, quot immites Dionisij easterras per agravere? He ha's in store a Catalogue of unexemplary Tyrants, for such unexemplary mischiefes. Passion in Discourses of this nature (which is farre better exprest in abrupt sighes, than polish'd speech;) will become well the penne of an Historian. Another Style is to bee used in peaceable Treaties, Nuptiall Solemnities, or Orations by way of Embassie and the like. In the distinguishing then of these, as I have formerly noted; is much discretion required. For to use any Style that may not suite with the Subject whereof he treates, argues a want of disposition in the Author: resembling such ridiculous Actors, who, whether they speake of Heaven or Earth, fixe their eyes alwayes on one place: or whether they speake of warre or peace, ever reteine one tune in their ill-disposed voyce. Shall we then a little longer insist upon such particulars, for matter of Style, as either impaires or improves the beauty of an History? Heare what my opinion, derived in part from others, is in this. These beseeme not a History; dilated circumstances, instances too much stood upon, an ambiguous leaving of something undetermined: They leave the understanding in doubt what to resolve, the judgement what to thinke, the thoughts what to deliberate: So as our reading conferres no other profit, save an intricate winding or wreathing of many anxieties up together: Giving the Minde free scope to imagine the event, being implyed by the Author. An Historian in his writing should have a kinde of seeming security for his Style and Order of Speech: yet not so, (as to omit an exact or wittily composed jest) to relish the Readers distaste:  404 Such was Tacitus use, by enterlacing the seriousnesse of his Tale, with some judiciall (but strangely briefe) sentences: annexing some pleasant straine, either of meere purpose invented, or from the occasion of his Subject derived, to sweeten the heavier part of his discourse: which should not be too long insisted on, for that were trifling; but shadowingly touched, for that implies plenty of Subject; not flying to triviall relations, to make up a greater Volume, but for the delight of the judiciously affected: Miscendo utile dulci. But alas, where this distinguishment of judgement of Histories requires great labour, it ofttimes obtaines as little favour: The present age cannot admit of such discourses, they be too serious: So that whosoever should compile a Volume of Judiciall extractions, or approved Observances, should hardly have as many Readers, as Persius conjectured for his Labours; Velduo, vel nemo : O ill disposed Times! when judgement  405 goes a Wool-gathering. Augustus had two which he especially respected above the rest of his Nobles, and the one of them was a Mec aenas , a Patron of learning, and a grace to the sacred influence of Poesie: But where should we finde an Atlas for Parnassus in these dayes? where Noble (yet degenerate Spirits) esteeme him that will be Pandor to his Punke, above him that will bee Patron to a Po em? It seemes strange that in best experienc't times, where knowledge should bee hightned, the foggy vapours of ignorance dispelled: Nay, where these times have respite from warlike Alarums, and therefore may securely feede at Minerva's Table, should be so delighted with superficiall shadowes, contemning the perfect essence and lustre of Man, (to wit) how to know himselfe. Here the Miser digges (and  406 with the Dormouse) sleepes out his time in a fruitlesse scraping; There the Prodigall (carelesse of times expence) bastardizeth his Fathers providence, leaving no more to himselfe, than that he could not take from himselfe, a poore Grave: Here the Ambitious man, displaying his pie-coloured flags of vanity (in the elation of his Spirit) contemnes the inferiour ranke of men, ever aiming at an higher Spheare than popular presse, till his aspiring produce his falling, and the honour which hee purchast without merit, forsakes him not without shame: But which of these will take paines to see himselfe represented in Exemplary Histories? If the Picture of old Menedemus were hung up in the eye of the Miser (he would I doubt it not) gaze with his foure eyes on the Picture, but make little or no use on the Patterne: The Ambitious man, if hee saw the Character of himselfe in that vast and undetermined minde of Catiline , in that ambitiously insinuating spirit of Seian , I feare me hee would rather make use of the meanes of his rising, than caution himselfe by his untimely declining: The Prodigall (expressing his owne Mirrour, by Theotimus errour) who preferred lust before his eyes, would (much I feare it) rather darken the eye of his Soule, to satisfie the eye of his Body, than moderate his passions on Earth, to reape the fruit of his Moderation in Heaven. O that these Times would so distinguish of their abuses, as being discovered, they may be censured; for where abuses are concealed, they seeme afresh to be renewed, and (with Authority) confirmed, but being openly ript, they may be whipt and stript: first displayed to the eye of the World, then summoned before the Throne of Iustice ! It was a constant Custome, as hath keene observed, "for the Roman State, and that when she was in her prime Monarchiall beauty, for all Artificers to carry about them the badges of their Trades, the Signals of their Conditions. And this every Mechanick willingly obeyed; so as, it was not permitted them to walke abroad through the Streets of the City, without this Cognizance of their quality. While one more precise than wise, standing one day forth in the presse of the people; "Sirs, quoth he, we are injoyned to goe with the severall Badges of our poore professions, and as meete is, we observe the Custome. Meane time, how shall we know what Trade our perfumed Silken Courtiers are of; our purple Consuls, or our Scarlet Citizens? Where be the Armes they beare? The Cognizants they carry? The Speech of this Critick Artizan came streight to the Emperours eare; who liking well of his blunt question, injoyned all such as reteined to his Court, or boare Magisteriall places in his Courts of Justice, or bore high Offices in the City, to observe the like course which those inferiour Mechanicks observed. This was enjoyned, and their observance expected. Many Devices and Impressa's were contrived, but few or none pleased. It was thought fit by the Emperour, that such devices and no other should accommodate them, as that very Artist should invent, who first proposed this Observation to them. He ready to embrace such a Taske; and obey so just a command, sets his Invention forthwith  407 on worke, which he discovers in this sort. For the Courtier , he gave him a Sweet Glove with this Impresse: Eius ero, quam gero. For the Consul, a Wedge of Gold with this Mott: Illi harco, quod fero. To the City Officiall, a Lampe in the snuffe , with these words: Ferveo, at fateo. Howsoever the device might seeme bitter, this invention was not onely approved, but rewarded by the Emperour. It is a true saying, "There is nothing that gives more nourishment to Vice than want of imployment: by doing nothing, wee shall soone learne to doe worse than nothing. Action is the life of Man; and when the Fancy is not well imployed, it will assay something that may witnesse to the World, it had better farre beene restrained. For my part, I cannot chuse but wonder (with  408 that Divine Cynick) how Man bred amongst Men should so soone forget the prime beauty of Man; as to suffer it to be drenched in the Lees of loose affections. How a living Substance, and that Substance endowed with Reason, should so faune on a Shadow. Or hold himselfe imparadized with the poore conceit of a smile from one lighter than Vanity. What an incomparable Favour is one ravish'd Feather from her Fanne, whose very levity is the Embleme of that Favour? Are these manly motions? What a tricking, trimming, poudring and purfling this Poore Rinde must have? what a varnish must Art bestow on it? Meane time, what Diogenes sometimes said to a youth too curiously and effeminately drest, may be truely said to this painted piece: "If thou goest to Men, all this is but in vaine, if unto women, it is wicked. Now, as the Lure of a light Curtezan is Lucre ; her aime must consequently be the ruine of her Lover . So as, her speech to her poore Suiter is the very same, which that old Strumpet used to a worneout Customer of hers, who asked daies of payment for his pleasure, Oculat ae nostrae sunt manus, credunt quod vident . If unguided youth would have his delights sensible, her receipts must be palpable. Lesse occasion of griefe it cannot be to any  409 one who affects Piety, or suffers with a just man in his wrongs: To see an honest and integrious cause fall light in the Scale, because his gold wants weight. To see justice weighed by graines: Or Scarlet attended by vices in the same Livery. Or a rich Chuffe, whose ill-thriving providence his posterity tastes of; to squeaze the weake ones with his unconscionable bargaines; to treasure to himselfe what will sticke by him, when poore dust (the remainder of all his care) shall receive him: Many a dry eye attend him: and his hungry Executors (as Ravens greedy after prey, and impatient of too long delay) shall imbrue his corpse with their blood before they bury him. Let these reflect upon themselves and their owne follies; and see themselves personated in divers instances in all our Histories: and when they have taken a full view of their owne enormities; which cannot be of such small proportion, but they will appeare visible enough to their recollected fancies, let me aske them in the same tearmes that the young Gallant in Erasmus , asked his wanton Mistresse: "Are yee not ashamed to doe that in the sight of God and testimony of his Angels, which yee are ashamed to do in the sight of Men, inferiour to Angles? Sores cannot be cured, till they be discovered and searched: a Morall Story h'as in readinesse a Probat to search them, and Balme enough, if usefully applide, to heale them. O let Histories, as they be Records of what were done, whether good or evill; excite us to be good, and deterre us from being evill: Stories are replenished with examples of both sorts, for they be Store-houses of precedent events, and consequently so to be observed and digested, as the Judicious Reader may 'better dispose of his events. I have noted in Discourses of this kind, the observance of that Generally Iudicious Gentleman, 410 and the best advancer of depressed Learning,  411 where he saith: Some Bookes are to be tasted, some to be swallowed, few to be chewed and digested . Such as are to be tasted I comprehend, in Stories of modest accomplement, superficiall flourishes, garnishing our Discourse modestly without vaine ostentation or bravery: Such are to be swallowed, as those Amorous, and fruitlesse labours of braine-sicke Authors, freighted with continuall Hyperbolees comely in nothing but love: Such are to be chewed and digested, as include discourse tending both to instruction and delight,  &c. So then, here we may come to our judiciall point; we see and read Histories, some onely to be tasted, others swallowed, some few chewed, as Beasts were in the old Law. Histories being ruminated and chewed, yeeld a continuall profit, and the more meditated, the more beneficiall; which seemed well approved (and no lesse  412 worthy our observance) by his institution, that wished every Reader to take these three remembrances in his way to reade: Libenter, Diligenter , and Intelligenter ; The first yeelds a present delight, because it includes a willingnesse; the next a diligent Attention, implying a seriousnesse; the last an use of both, enfolding an understandingnesse:  413 These three attend a judicious distinguishing of Histories, Judgement in discerning what is best, and these to apprehend the best: These foure commixed resemble twinnes at two burthens, all directours one to another: for without judgement, we may chuse the worst as soone as best, taking our aime onely at delight, without recourse to profit, best agreeing with the outward sence; here is a want in the Election: without willingnesse, our reading breeds a loathing; without diligence, our discourse is fruitlesse; and without understanding, our minds be erring. And thus much for dijudicating of Histories, an essentiall part of this Booke: I have but summarily set down my Opinion (grounded on the collections of others) herein, that I might prosecute the former parts of my Division in the Method of this History, contracting much into a little Body. \------------------------------ The Method which I propounded to my selfe in the beginning, was first to describe the Scope of Histories: Secondly, the use, fruit, and effect of Histories in generall: and the  414 third extracted from the second, that the particular Profit which redounded eyther to a Family in private, or administration of States in publicke by these Histories. For the first, being the original whence the two others are drained, I have spoken sufficiently: Longer (I confesse) was I enforced to insist upon them, then my Volume (which I prescribed my selfe) would admit: But the many Vses, Subdivisions, and grounds naturally arising from them, enforced me to prosecute the Argument more fully: I intend now to handle the second part, to wit, the Fruite and Vse of History , the speciall'st Motive inducing reading. \------------------------------ The greatest and movingst argument of perswasion to the undertaking of this or that, is  415 the benefit we expect redounding from our enterprise: I will succinctly expresse the severally-moving effects of profit (the worldly mans Adamant) from History, Naturally and Essentially derived: which being laid open, I hope the Miser (who as Seneca noteth, is good to none, but worst to himself) will be profitable both to himselfe and others: My Exordium shall be drawne from him, because I take him to be one of the divils chiefest Factors, and more benefit should I yeeld my Country in bringing such an one, than in taking an Arch-pirate: From him descending to every vitious professour (binding my selfe ever to my tackling) the fruit of History , in it selfe able to reclaime the depraved'st from their habituated enormities. A Miser and Misery were ever held Correlatives.  416 And he is that true Miser, who, like the blind Mole, receives al his nutriment from Mold. It is strange that any Creature endued with Reason, should so much slave the freedom of so right a Soveraignesse to the thraldome of Sense. When 417 the Prince or Princesse falls sick, the whole Court mournes, sayes that incomparable Morall . Apply this to thy owne Condition, miserable Wormeling; thy Princesse is mortally sicke; thy  418 Soule who languisheth irrecoverably; how can all her faculties doe lesse than suffer? Shee ever hated conversing with Earth: her Contemplation was in an higher Spheare. And as a Plant removed from that Soile where it liked, and brought to a plotte of ground from her Nature estranged; shee h'as of late quite lost her Verdure and Vigour. Thus hast thou suffer'd thy Divine part to be drowned and drenched in the contemptiblest refuse and rubbish on Earth. Oh that thou knew'st but what a smal! scantling or portion of this Earth which thou so much affectest, must serve thy turne: and what a small measure in the Interim (if thy desires would rest so satisfied) will afford thee a Competence! These thy unbounded and Hydropick affections would confine themselves to a straiter Circumference. Truth is, there is nothing which this Earthworme enjoyes, that hee can properly entitle his owne. For as those Temporary Blessings which hee h'as received, are estranged from his use: so the very thoughts of his heart are not his owne, because they are ever fixing on anothers Farme. Hee sees nothing flourish in anothers Pasture, but the Object of it begets his distemper. Others fatness makes him leane. To  419 gaine him an estate, he cares not how he macerate his Body. It fareth with such men as these, as it doth with the Sea-Eagle , who, when hee  420 cannot seaze upon his prey, he throws himselfe head-long into the Gulfe. Now, whereto extends this immoderate Care? he will tell you, for himselfe and his posterity. Let us then divide these parcells of his Care, and collect what use hee makes of it either in respect of himselfe, or his Scapethrist Heire. It is good providence (for so hee guilds his Avarice) which hath brought him to this macerating Care. He cannot endure to see the Creatures of God, so lavishly nor carelesly scattered. He h'as resolv'd to hold an hanke: Though it be now Summer with him, hee knows not how soone Winter may come. He h'as resolv'd therefore to play the provident Ant; to have his Granars full; Vine-presses flow; to have a Friend in a corner to revenge him of his Foe, and doe his Friend a pleasure. 421 These are faire flourishes; but looke what precious fruits these glorious Resolves produce! What benefit brings all this hoording to himself? Or what utility to the publick State? To himselfe, I dare say, neither living or dying. For observe him while he is living; and you shall find  422 him the poorest and leanest Soule in all his Meniey. Yea, he could be well contented, of all Sects, to be a Pythagorean ; wishing with all his heart (so it might stand with the conservation of Nature) neither to eate nor drinke all his life-time: but he intends not this abstinence to increase his knowledge, but to improve his Fortunes by an abstemious providence. So as, that Cynick tooke not his marke amisse, when resolving one day to distinguish a Land-buyer from a Seller; a miserable Chuffe from a sociable Good-fellow; tooke his ayme by their Physnomies. If hee saw one plumpe-fac'd, ruddy-complexion'd, cheerefully countenanc'd, quick-ey'd, hee would accoast him with this Salute: "Sir, are not you a Seller? But when he saw one of a leane meagre Countnance, chop-falne, earthy complexion'd, he would presently alter his conjecture upon sight of his Feature, and greete him thus: "In good sadnesse, grave Sir, are not you a Purchaser? Whence we may safely conclude: That 423 he ha's the best part in the World, that ha's least part in it. Nor can this unprofitable care of a wretched Worlding, become any way usefull to him in his dying. His Testament is made; and he leaves in it what he is unwilling to leave. And to whom he leaves it, he knowes not; but enjoy must others, what he could not. A Grave-stone, perchance, may distinguish him from the poor ones of the Parish. But for an Inscription, either his memory merits none, or his mindlesse Executor bestowes none; or the dis-esteeme of his Survivers will not deagne him one. Nor can this penurious providence of his, afford much good to his succeeding Scatter-good . Who cries out with that short-mourning Gallant; so soone as he h'as earth'd the Foxe. Away with Sable, Bugle, Cypresse-black ,  424 For now mine humour is to mourne in Sack. Thus have you pensil'd out the Portrature of a Miser. His insatiate desire of encreasing his State, his uselesse end in disposing his Store: all which by a right use of Historicall Observations, may receive a speedy cure. 425 The Miser, that is indebted to both backe and belly, so engaged to the World, as he must have his houshold-God of the World, ever harboured in his bosome, or made his pillow to sleepe on, the key of his rust: Hee that never fed Nature in all his dayes with competency; or durst recreate himselfe, for feare least his recreation should play cheater, and cousen him of his providence: being the moath of the vertuous, the harbour of the vitious: carrying a conscience more infectious than Rats-bane ever about him; if ever he have grace to cast his eye into an Historicall Discourse (next to the Sacred Writ) he shall finde as Soveraigne Antidotes for his malady, as in any place. I will Anatomise the Misers corruptions, and like an artificiall practitioner first open his wounds, and then infuse Balme into them, which Unction if it will not serve, I shall then apply more rough and sharp plaisters. Now Master Miser, that is, meere wretched man; thou hast sufficient, and more than is competent for nature, yet thou art not satisfied: A very, very little will serve thee for thy use, for thou never hadst the Grace to know what an honest expence meant: Thou Tantalizest thy selfe; amid'st of plenty, famished; Thou hast a good mind to be rich, but that's impossible: Semper 426 avarus eget ; There is a greedy worme that is ever consuming and gnawing on thee: Thou art at liberty, yet imprisoned, and in more intollerable servitude, than the misarablest Captive upon earth; yet thy chaines are of gold, thou art  427 a gorgeous prisoner; Thou art subjected to more hazards than a Merchant Venturer; to more nightly oppressing, and sur-charching cares, than an Emperour; to more hourely distractions, and terrible apparitions, than a Murtherer: Thou wouldst sleepe if thou couldst, but thy disturbed thoughts deprive thee of that comfort: To be briefe, as thou art in Image  428 the best, so in disposition the worst of all creatures, being thine owne Timon , thine owne hangman, that macerates thy selfe, and makes thy appetite ever insatiate. I will lead thee into a spacious field of Histories, where thou shalt see thy immerited mind deblazoned in her colours; not a memorable instruction for Liberality (thy absolute Opponent) but shall be produced for thy use: that seeing the eminence of thy Adversary, thou maist hate thy selfe, and bee reconciled at last to thy Foe. The Liberall-hearted man is as much Master  429 to himselfe, as thou art thine owne Slave: he surpasseth thee in use of his owne, and can direct himselfe by an equall proportion, limited ever to a generally approved end. Hee hates to draw in the Sailes of his Bounty, in the presence of desert; and makes no more account of his own, than to distribute to others wants a share of his fortunes; nor esteemes he that his owne, of which he hath not power, and in his power can freely give: hee verefies the Verse (approving a liberall mind: Quod nunquam dederit, non habuisse putat : He never was so farre ingaged, or enthraled to any earthy substance, as to make it chiefetaine over his intellectuall part: he makes this his Position, and scornes it should be controuled by any inferiour subject: To give, and to delight in 430 giving  : And that day wherein (to the moity of his fortunes) he hath not demonstrated the rare Character of his Bounty, he cryes out with Titus, Amici, per didimus diem ! This day hath beene an abridgement of my generous intentions, a restraint to my extended mind! I did never shew my selfe, lesse to bee my selfe, than in this dayes exigent! This is He who measures Vertue for his meere peace and contentment, and not according to successe; hee shewes not his liberality for observance, but peculiar satisfaction; for he imagines no greater infelicity, than to be miserable; His promises are ever relatives with his performances: He scornes to dissemble with the World; he never annoynted his tongue  431 to enrich his fortunes. The perfect Idiome and Character of his Native Properties is already depictured; I will illustrate this Mirrour of Vertues with Exemplary Mirrours, Professours of this Vertue: Reade but the ancient Romane Annals you shall see many renowned for Liberality, and in Syracusa too, for her Eminence and exquisite Government no lesse glorious. In Rome a 432 Fabius Maximus : who willingly forgoes his Patrimony, to preserve his Countries reputation: Seenim Patrimon ÿ, quam patriam fidei inopem essemaluit. Busa no lesse renowned, and in this more to be observed, because a Woman, whose sexe implies a parsimony, relieving the poore distressed Romans (coupt up in the Walls of Canna ) making her selfe poor, to adde power (by her bounty) to the afflicted. In these examples and expressions of Liberality, let this our Worke for that Pious Office which we desire to performe, returne to her former Method; addressing it selfe to a commemoration of so faire a Subject: with which, Princely and Noble Dispositions are most taken; and by which, those who depend on others bounty, are seasonably relieved. Now, this excellent Vertue, or if you will,  433 Ornament of Majesty, derives her Originall (as may be probably gathered) from two especial Fountaines: true Iudgement in discerning; and charitable benevolence in commiserating. For whensoever it springs from these, Bounty may ever give a reason of what it gives, and to whom it imparts it selfe. For though the greatnesse of the gift winne grace and love to the giver; yet the season or opportunity of giving makes it more effectuall to the receiver. That Fabius , whom we formerly remembred,  434 shewed singular arguments of this bounty; whose example we the rather presse afresh, because the Opportunity of his bounty added to the estimate of it: The gift bestowed was but small, but the season made it great. A little summe of money inlarged the continuance of his memory. For having redeem'd at Hannibals hand, the liberty of such prisoners as had beene taken by him, in those Warres. When the City of Rome would not discharge that summe, for which he had articulated: he sent his owne Sonne to Rome , purposely to set at sale the whole Farme he had from his Ancestors. He valued little his owne Patrimony, in regard of the redemption of a Prisoners liberty; and so free his Countrey, whose fame he prized above Life, from breach of promise, and so deepe a brand of infamy. Now, if we should account the price of what he gave, it was but small. This Hereditary Farme consisted but of seaven Acres, and those lying in Papinia : but when we consider the mind of the Giver, we shall find no masse of money so great, but it appeares greater. The Inheritance of his Predecessours must be set at sale, rather than his indeared Countrey suffer the least staine. He had rather lose his Farme, than shee should lose her Fame. Wherein he seemes by his noble endeavours to deserve greater commendation, shewing himselfe so willing to extend his bounty (in an act of such necessity) even to the utmost of his ability; farre out-stripping such, who give farre within their power, or from their superfluity: for whereas the One bestoweth what he may, the Other more than he may. No Lines, were they never so full of Life and Memory, can sufficiently advance that aspiring Spirit of Roman Liberality; when after the overthrow of Philip King of Macedon , all Greece assembled together to bewitnesses of such a Spectacle; Quintus Flaminius (of whom I shall occasionally speake hereafter) commanding silence by the sound of a Trumpet, commanded these words to be published by the Cryer: "The Senat, People, Questors of Rome , and Quintus Flaminius her Generall, command that all those Cities of Greece , which were under the late dominion of Philip shall enjoy all freedome and infranchisement. Which words were no sooner heard, then those people taken with a great and unexpected joy, at first, as if they had not beleev'd their owne eares, they kept silence. But when the same words were re-delivered by the Cryer, to enforce more credit in the Hearer, they deafned the Aire with such a shrill shout, as for certaine the very Birds which flew above them, amazed and ravished with the sound, fell from the Aire. Surely, it was an argument of a nobly-disposed mind to free so many Captives from restraint, and to bestow the same liberty upon them, which the people of Rome , glorious by her many victories, had sometimes bestowed on their richest Cities. And to adde a greater lustre or majesty to that worke of bounty, it conduceth much to commemorate not onely the liberality of the Giver, but the free assent or approbation of the people to that Gift: for as there is a Commendation due to the act recorded, so likewise to the praise it selfe deservingly rendred. But while Rome sends forth such noble Branches, who on so flourishing and fruitful a Mother bestowed all honour, her owne Munificence should not be buried in silence. And redound it will highly to her praise, to recount what a brave bounteous mind she shewed to Kings, Cities and Countries: seeing, the honour of every deserving action, the more it is revived, the more it spreadeth in beauty. When Rome had taken all Asia , she bestow'd it as a gift upon King Attalus , to possesse; imagining, that the Soveraignty of her Imperiall City would appeare so much more glorious and specious, if she bestowed the richest and pleasantst part of the World for a benefit to another, rather than keepe it as a Store-house for her selfe. Especially, where the victory it selfe is the happiest  435 gift: because, as to possesse much begetteth envy, so to give of that we possesse, cannot want glory. That bounteous and royall expression of victorious Cyrus to his successive Allies, deserves a  436 due memory. Who, at such a time as he was to try Masteries for a Kingdome with his Grandsire Astiages ; exhorted such as were his Assistants in that Warre, that they should with all alacrity go on in that Service: for if he prosperously succeeded in that fight, as the justnesse of his cause, the equity of the quarrell, and hopefull predictions by knowing Augurs assured nothing lesse: he would make Foote-men, Horse-men; and of Horse-men, Charrioters. Great mindes are not for small gifts. Eminent Personages must ever second their quality with rich Presents. The like disposition shewed Lucullus in his Princely entertainment to all such Persons of quality as repaired to him. Beautifull walkes he had to receive them; bountifull Tables to Feast them; choicest Consorts to converse with them; Melodious ayres to delight them; curious Pictures to entertaine them. Nothing so much disrelish'd him as to see his Hospitality want a Subject; or his desire to extend his bounty, an occasion to expresse it. Strangers could not there want for repose. A free welcome they receiv'd without being ever question'd from whence they came, or when they would goe. This differ'd far from that Adage: Guests of one Night stay may be kindly welcome ,  437 Guests of a next night are not held so toothsome, Guests of a third night are reputed noisome To the Receiver. This was that L. Lucullus , of whom Cicero reporteth, that when hee went from Rome to make Warre upon Mithridates , he was altogether unskilfull of Military affaires: yet in the time of his Navigation hee so experienc'd himselfe, as by the confession of the King, he was preferred aboue all others for judgement in Martiall service. That bounteous mind of Eutrapelus , of whom that incomparable Lyrick makes such a free and  438 genuine mention; deserves all esteeme. Those things, which our Age most fooles herselfe in, he with much sleightnesse gave away to his foes. A curious neat dresse could not so take him: nor the fashions of the time so delude him, but hee could with all indifferency forgo them: stripping himselfe of all occasion of being proud, to insatuate his profest foes with his pride. But no bounty ever powr'd it selfe forth more freely, nor bestow'd it selfe more deservingly, than of that brave Millanoise ; who professing himselfe ever a constant Patron to the Muses; and falling casually into discourse with a Stranger, whose rich expressions (as he conceiv'd) discover'd him to be a Scholler: he desired much to heare the course of his Travaile: Who, to satisfie so just a demaund, related to him, amongst other passages, what cold entertainment hee had received, amongst many who profest themselves Favorites of Learning: but of one Grande above all the rest, where he no sooner repaired, then he was unhospitably dismissed. Leave hee tooke of him, and leave hee quickly gave him: which, to set forth the better to life he returned a briefe of his entertainment in these Stanza's: Good leave I had, for none did me importune To take my late repose, so as I found Men shap'd their lookes according to my fortune, Which forced me to traversing my ground To find some place with my condition Sorting, Where to retire but not to seeke reliefe, I thought it fitt'st to descant on my griefe. And cause I had to grieve to see the time So much deprav'd, as I perceived than None could to Greatnesse but by Fortune clime, And that it was the meanes that made the man, Which I applide unto that Fate of mine; Devising how to passe the night away, Till th Morning Star should guide th' approaching day. These Lines wrought so strongly upon that bounteously-disposed Millanoise , as commiserating the Condition of a contemned Scholler, he returned him this Regreet. "It is true, Sir, Desert receives not alwayes entertainment; for as you shall encounter with some who cannot distinguish of worth; so you shall meete with others who will not acknowledge Worth, purposely to spare their wealth. You shall not finde all hearts so affected, nor all mens Judgments so filmed. Remaine with me, Sir, and welcome; Be a Commander, while you are heere a Sojourner. I have a Wardroabe heere for the Muses , if they be naked; and a Place richly endowed too, if for retirement they be disposed. Nothing shall be awanting to them, so they be not awanting to themselves. It ha's beene and ever shall be held mine highest Honour, to be esteemed worthy the entertainment of a Scholler. But we proceed in this Branch of our History, to other remarkable Instances for Liberality. Quintus Considius (of all most memorable) 439 an Usurer and Bountifull; a blacke Swan was never rarer: the Pagan Usurer (it seemes) had a conscience, which our Christian Usurer wants: for in that bloody, and inhumane Conspiracy of Catiline , second to none, our Moderne Counterbuffe, our Powder-treason excepted: hee remitted all his Debtors, laying his Bills and Bonds upon one pile, making a Bone-fire with them: where I make no question, but the Usurers continuall Customers, the Po et Archias , and his Eccho, the Actor Roscius had reason to sweare: Quod nunquam ignem vidissent clariorem : That they never saw a clearer or more comfortable fire in all  440 their dayes. It may be Considius did this, because he saw the disability of his Debtors (for those Civill Commotions had much empoverished all Estates) and therefore in policy, once to expresse his bounty, thought it fittest to forgive them that, which they were not able to give. More worthy is the memory of Quintius Flaminius , who in an Istmian Triumph, in the presence of his Countries foe, the daring Philip of Macedon , redeemed such as were Philips Captives at his owne charge: Worthy our observation it is, willing to answer so publick Solemnity, with an universall-concording harmony, making such free Spectators, that were before in servitude. 441 The modest Prince Hiero of Syracusa , who in meere compassion of the slaughter of the Romans , at the Lake Thrasimenus , sent to the afflicted remnant of that wofull Army, three hundred Thousand Bushels of Wheate, two hundred of Barley, and two hundred and forty pound weight of Gold to relieve their wants, and manifest his royall bounty. I may annexe the memorable example  442 of Gillia of Agrigentum , who was rich in Mines, but much more rich in minde, alwayes rather inclined to distribute than scrape: so as his house (and that not undeservedly) was called Officina Munificenti ae , a Ware-house of Bounty; erecting Monuments for publick use, that the eyes of the people might be delighted with so gratefull spectacles: Here were prepared sumptuous Feasts, yeelding and ministring food, and all other necessaries for the sustaining Nature, to all way-faring men, bestowing dowers upon Maids, and reliefe to the poore, ministring plenty of comfort (out of his Royall Exchequer) to such as had sustained any detriment, or damage. To be briefe, hee kept open Hospitality, receiving  443 five hundred Celensian Gentlemen at one time, by occasion of Tempest driven upon his Coast, which he fed at his owne Table; and at their departure royally adorned them with sumptuous Garments. To be short, thou wouldst not (saith our History) have taken him for any Mortall, for he was too liberall, but the very Bounties-bosome of propitious Fortune. Thou hast seene these Examples of Liberality; I will now unrip thy owne Casket, and see what worthy Pictures thou hast lockt up in it. I see many bagges of mould, but not one ragge of Conscience: great Chests ramm'd up with inexorable barres, crammed with Avarice, Famine, and Oppression. Lucifer is thy Treasurer, proving a faithfull servant: for hee will not cheate thee for a World, lest hee should lose his part of thee in the World to come. Thou committest to him the Keyes of thy Conscience; which opens and shuts upon all occasions: Hee being one of thy Family, how canst thou chuse but be prosperous? Yet beleeve me (thy end will be poore and miserable) not one of those many Angels thou possessest, like a good Angell, will guard, or give thee so much as the least taste of Comfort. I come not to instruct thee, like a Divine, but to illustrate my Assertions by Historicall Examples, which I have here placed before thee, to deterre thee from their life, that thou mayest avoid their death. Avarice, or (which is extended further) Misery, was best exemplified in Hermon ; who to deceive his owne friends, and deprive them of that which he made his God; at his Death, made himselfe his owne Executor: This man would be loath to lose so precious a Friend; Death must not part him and his Riches. No question but his Opinion was, hee might purchase himselfe a Tabernacle of rest with his rust:  444 and translated from the vale of Earth, might erect himselfe a Mansion of pure Gold, for hee carryed the stuffe with him. I could heere produce infinite other Examples, which, to avoid tediousnesse, I omit, and returne to our Discourse. History may yeeld no lesse profit to the Prodigall, who makes himselfe the last of his name; who no sooner (yea oft-times sooner) than he hath shut his Fathers eyes, opens his Fathers Chest, and wipes away the remembrance of his Fathers Death, with the Evidence and Broad Scale of his Fathers love: he had need of some direction. Many of these are no sooner come to their Lands, than they run out of their Witts. They were sicke of a Father while hee lived; and now they live to become a prey to others, by whom they are more usually jeered than loved. Now, 445 to display this brave Prodigalls humour, and render him in his true Colours; I shall not need to bestow much paines upon him, seeing the Satyre h'as already so exactly done it for him: Sad goes he to his Fathers Grave ,  446 But glad do'es he returne, For why! his baggs cram'd with re'd Ladds! Doe bid him cease to mourne. These easie Obsequies once done; he must of necessity fall into acquaintance with all those Officious Creatures, whose abilities conduce much to the making up of a Gentleman. He, who now stands resolv'd never to measure his owne expence, must be measur'd by his Taylor; accommodated by his sweet-sented Milliner; Bever'd by his Haberdasher; stand nearely indeared to his amorous Sempster. Having thus throwne away his Sable dresse, and suited himselfe Cap a pe to the fashion of the Time: He must have Faunes  447 or Followers to spunge him. Such, in one word, as never knew what reputation meant; nor were ever acquainted with what credit meant, farther than running on score. And these must be the Carvers out of his estate. Excellent Stewards to manage a fortune! Now, if this Gentele Gallant set his rest for the City; the height of his ambition is to receive instruction from Corranto's and Play-bills . These Notions must regulate the whole course of his Living. Acquaintance he h'as got him; and such as meane to gull him and gueld him of that wherewith his Father did guild him. For such is the misery of man, as he cannot endure to be seene in that place, where he is not best himselfe. Associates he h'as from all quarters of the World, and of all qualities, save good. Some Bilbow Blades he meetes withall, and those either for feare of an affront; or purposely to make them his Champions upon occasions of quarrell, he makes Guard le Corpse . And these can humour him to an haire; call him their Annibal : and that Title payes for all. If hee fall into acquaintance with a decayed Artist; whose prodigall course h'as brought him to partake of Cheate. He will not sticke upon the very first Salute to become his Ingle . And this Honeysuckle must broake for him (being that wherewith he h'as beene from his Infancy vers'd) in counterfeit Jewels: and these must bee return'd to him for rich ones. For the graines of his discerning judgement were long since scattered: so as, he may rest secure for discovery. To satisfie his Senses one Night, it must cost him as much as his Fathers care gathered in a whole yeare. But now after many unrighteous Bills discharg'd; the Moone beginnes to be i'th waine with him. His Exchequer in the Country, affords him no such fresh nor frequent supply for his Port, sport and support in the City, as it used to doe. For want then of other profits and emolluments, he must be forced to take up Commodities . Dainty trash to maintaine his traine! But nothing violent can be permanent: that Conduit is soone dryed up. In a word, hee never takes up with himselfe, till he be taken up by others. He was drunke all this time, and now restraint h'as brought him to himselfe, and made him suffer. But if the Prodigalls humour be such, as it confines him to the Countrey, without any farther aspiring either to Court or City; because hee's no Letterd man, he h'as chosen to bestow his meanes upon the pleasures of H which is no Letter . His onely Discourse is in commendation of his Hound ; from whom he differs onely in Sent ; for coupled they might bee well together for Sence . His Horse cannot gallop faster in Chace, than hee out of his estate. His Hauke flies so high, as she lessens her selfe; which may serve for his Embleme: having flowne so long a flight, as he hath lessen'd himselfe both in credit and fortune: both which after a long mouting, scatter abroad like Feathers in the Aire. His Courtezan (to close his illiterate Alphabet in one) h'as left him; and vowes she cannot love him, because he h'as lost his wits: but indeed, the losse of his estate is the reason. Shee bids him for want of better maintenance, goe to an Hospitall; and she at leasure will follow after: and no sooner than neede requires; for as hee stands in neede of reliefe, so she of a Plaister. Whence we may collect (though there be no necessary inference of any such Collection; arising rather from the corruption of a youthfull vicious disposition) that a Fathers injurious  448 doing, becomes oftimes his Heires undoing; the Fathers raising, the Sonnes ruine. Oh let these young Lapwings , who leave their nest before they can finde wing, and make their pleasure a Labyrinth of Labour, looke homeward! There be many mazes for the young man: I  449 have knowne many exposed to all delights, and (as it were) sold under the gage of prostitution, who by Historicall observations have not onely reclaimed their former errour, but grew singular mirrours of purity. No question, if Catiline , whose mind was ever subjected to illimited affections, had but perused the excellent relations  450 of his noble Predecessors, he had not beene onely able to extinguish that common and universall cumbustion, which his aspiring spirit raised to consume his whole Countrey; but had beene memorable for his owne attchievements: for the best of Roman Historians (that I may use the Words of the best Commenter upon  451 Crispus Salustus ) saw thus much into his disposition, that so long as he retired himselfe from those factious and mutinous spirits, Cethegus, Lentulus , with others of that hatefull consort, none shewed himselfe a more profitable member to the Common-weale, or more ready to endanger himselfe for her availe; imploying his time in serious discourses; which not onely moderated his affections, but poised him to the equall ballance of a vertuous Discourse: which afterwards perverted by the depraved suggestions of those Ruffins, reduced those faire beginnings to nothing, and him to a miserable death, and perpetuall infamy. The very same effect we see in all other Vices (which would be well extenuated) if vitious  452 mindes would apply themselves to these, and the like Discourses: we should have our drunkards see into their owne shame, deblazoned by the Epirotes ; our Epicures by the ravenous Vitell ÿ ; spending their fortunes in pampering their worst houshold servant; our carnall Brothelists, by those impudent prostitutes in Neroes time, who were never weary of their shame, till their publicke filthinesse ingendred a loathiug in the professours themselves: looke to these mens ends! Oh, how long might I prosecute this argument without want of copious Discourse! Here producing an Heliogabilus , generally hated for his  453 insatiate Lust, and least pittied in that ebbe of his frailty (his miserable death) when men use most to be pittied, being attended at his funerals with Military reproaches: "Here goe we to bury a Dogge of distempered lusts: there, a wanton Messalina , rewarded with a death beseeming her. Here, an aspiring Sejanus , shaken with an unexpected end, and made miserable in his best fortunes, interred with dry eyes: For who will pitty the fall of Ambition? There an Herostratus (memorable for nothing but villany) purchasing by his fame an infamous end. Here, a bloody Perillus , expert in the invention of cruell Projects, punished with the Torture of his owne Invention: There, a fleering Parasite, who circumvents himselfe with his owne policy. Such exemplary motives be frequent in Histories, and able in themselves (if duly pondered) to enforce Nature from her selfe, and reduce Man, primarily addicted to this or that Vice, to a consideration of his owne estate, wisely foreseeing his owne danger by others misery; wisely; Cautioning the young man to levell his affections at another scope, than the depraved intendments of the time wherein he liveth; making difference betwixt sence and reason: the one common  454 to Beasts with men: the other a dis-junct propriety onely to man from beasts: For reason, the directresse of our understanding, the limiter of our affections within honest bounds, the Touch-stone to dijudicate what is good, from what is ill, the intellectuall Notion of the soule, should be ever the conducter of our fancies;  455 which is best shown, when ( Antomedon -like) we can delineate Vertue in no better shadow, than the Tablet of our owne Hearts; expressing our selves the best by that, which makes our selves the best, to wit, in prosecuting Vertue with an earnestnesse, that in the end we may become Masters of our selves, governours of our affections, and right Siegniors over our in-disposed Fancies. What admirable Effects have bin and may be drawne from History , to subdue and regulate our  456 affections, who is he knoweth not, presupposing him conversant in such generous studies? This may be easily gathered by that very heat or vertuousemulation we shall find even in our selves, upon perusal of others commendable actions. For as we are allured by the beauty of goodnesse, to desire nothing more then to be possessed of it: knowing, no outward beauty comparable to it; so are we deterred from shewing any affection to vice, for the deformity of it: and those odious fruits which burgen from it. La is , though of all Greek Curtezans, none more comely, came far short of vertue for true beauty: and Na is , though none more ougly, came nothing neare vice for her deformity. When the Carthage Queene heard the sad Relation of that amorous Trojan , touching all those Tragicke passages during the siege and destruction of Troy , she could not take a Survey of such a discourse without the attendance of some Princely compassionate teares. Such strong impressions beare others actions in the Theatrall Act of this Life. 457 But to apply receipts to every distinct malady; and by Historicall helpes minister to every severall sore a soveraigne remedy; tell me, you Iudicious Readers of Historie , is there any distemper whereof you labour, which you shall not find chaced and chasticed by some Historicall Example! Yea, answere me in all or any of these, if at any time you find your selves pestred with any of these, if Receipts (according to the quality of those distempers) may not be found out for a seasonable cure of these! Doth vaine-glory transport you; that Spirit of Pride which makes man forgetfull of himselfe? you shall find in History , many Examples to deterre you from it. You shall there, as in a transparent Mirror, behold the Lydian Cr aesus sitting in his chaire of State, beautifi'd with the exquisitest accomplements that the Majesty of a King could put on; and Him you shall heare thus Enthroned, thus adorned, asking a wise Sage (to discover his folly the more) if ever he beheld a more beautefull or gracefull Spectacle? And you shall heare this vaine piece of Princely Pompe  458 jeered to his face. "Yes, sayes he, Dunghill  459 Cockes, Phesants, Peacockes: for these are cloathed with a native beauty, whereas yours is but a borrowed glory. Whence, you shall find that Sentence of Menander rightly verified:  460 "Every foole is carried away with arrogance and applause. You shall likewise heare Antiochus (to illustrate more fully the misery of vaine-glory ) at one time saluted a glorious Prince, and a furious Tyrant. Againe, are you naturally addicted to that Groundling vice of Avarice ? you shall find what brave contempt of riches appeared in Ethnick Breasts. This you may find portraide to life in a Phocion, Solon, Crates, Anacharses, Cimon, Timon, Fabritius . Nothing held These to be more contemptible, then what true wisedome most contemned. Or stand you enthralled to Passion , which makes the wisest man a Bedlamer for the instant? You shall find excellent meanes to attemper this commotion. Lessons given by Pagans unto Pagans, and worthy to be left for golden Legacies by Christians unto Christians. That wise Athenodorus , departing from Augustus , and taking his leave, to expresse a Philosophers love, left this Lesson with him, deserving well to be imprinted by him: That when he was angry, or intended to pronounce any sentence upon a delinquent; he should repeate the foure and twenty Greeke letters . Which lesson C aesar received as an ornament in value more precious than a Diadem. You shall likewise find an Architas no lesse commended; hearing him least expresse it, when most incensed. If he find his Hinde idling, he can keep his patience, and discreetly admonish him: O how would I have beaten thee had I not bin angry with thee ! Or doth that rankling vice, Envy , eating up the heart and marrow of her Master, seaze on you? you shall heare what a brave Platonicke Common-weale sometimes flourished, when that Law of Nature, holding possession of all things in common, was in request. Before Carthage was destroyed, Rome both quietly and modestly govern'd her affaires. There was no contending nor contesting for glory nor commaund amongst her Citizens; they guided all things peaceably, and succeeded in all things prosperously. That antient Kings evill , desire of raigning and invading had not as then infected them. Whence you may truly collect, by application had to these present times, what that glorious Divine out of his owne Experience  461 sometimes observed, "If these two Pronouns Mine and Thine would but cease, there would not arise such differences in the world. Or if a Liquorish appetite captivate reason; you shall read in a Laconian , what moderation would suite well with a Christian . Here you may find a whole Pythagorean state: nothing more affected then Moderation; nothing lesse relishing then licentious surfeiting. Or if unbounded Sensuality wanton in you: you shall find what you want, exemplified in a Zeno , a Zenocrates ; and not only in Philosophers, but victorious Princes. Where you shall see brave Cleopatra (one who sometimes bare a Majesticall Soveraignty in her eye; and could insult over a Prince with a scornefull looke, and make him her slave with a smile) kneeling at the feet of C aesar , laying baits for his eyes; but in vaine: her beauties were beneath that Princes chastity. Or desire you to be retir'd, or to feed your remisse Spirits with Sloth ? Oh what spurs you shall find to quicken your dulled and rebaited courage? what animosity in those who were mannagers of Martiall affaires? what industry in all Arts and Sciences? what deliberation in undertaking, what resolution in executing? Lucullus cannot enjoy himselfe in his owne Tent. A noble Spirit ever finds it selfe active for employment. Thus shall you find presented before you, whatsoever may in the homely habit of Vertue allure you: or whatsoever cloathed with the odious visage of vice may deterre you. Nor is it possible to find out any Morall way better to regulate or marshall your affections, than by a serious Survey had, and usefull application made of these Historicall relations. But to come more neare thee in this second part of my Division, we must distinguish of the severall fruits and effects of History, directed to peculiar ends: As first, art thou a Lover, and desirest to complement with thy beloved? Thou art in a dangerous way, and if thou wisely select not such Histories, as may (like soveraignes) rather allay and moderate thy braine-sick passion, than kindle the fire of thy senselesse reason, be lulled with nightly apparitions of thy beloved faire one, to what exorbitances shalt thou be made subject? But I know the Nature of thy sicknesse: thou art like one who hath taken poyson; and though Drinke be mortall to him, yet he longeth out of all measure for it. There is no Subject so fitting thy humour, as amorous Sonnets, Historicall Relations, carolling out the discontents of unsatisfied love. Leander swimming over Hellespont , to crop  462 a blossome already cropped. Achylles retiring discontented for the losse of his Briseis, Agamemnon for his Chryseis : these are Subjects for thy Love- sick Fancy; whereas opposites to Love, (Morall Relations, instructing thee in a more equall and reasonable path) would better cure thy disease, and bring thee to an understanding of thy selfe. Absence (wee say) from our Mistresse, makes us most forgetfull of her; and least we thinke of her when wee discourse of Arguments least concerning her; whilst reading Idle Pamphlets, the very bane and canker of Youth, and Age too: for Age is as subject to Dotage, as Youth to Fancy; putting us in mind of our former distracting passions, crying: Nec me minor 463 urget Amor  : with hard-hearted Mistresse, inconstant Dame, fickle in affection, inconstant in thy Resolution shedding as many teares as would drowne his Mistresse, if she were not so light, as she is able to beare herselfe above water. Alas poore Lover! and where to so many fruitlesse wishes, so discomfortable laments, so discordant Eccho's of redoubled sighes, Aye me unhappy ? Thou knowest not how these reasonlesse perturbations make thee more loathed than loved, more intranced than fancied; and more beleagred with passions anew, than to salve those passions wherewith thou wer't tormented of old. Read the continent Life of Zenocrates , dedicated wholly to Chastity; not a La is (though never so motive) can induce him to gage his reputation to a Harlot. Read me the noble disposition of Scipio Affrican , who scorn'd to make himselfe a Slave to his fancy: the royall  464 mind of that potent Alexander , who would not captive his affection to his Captive: the undestained Resolution of the Matron Antonia , Wife to Drusus : that chast Tragedian Sophocles , who  465 being demanded, whether hee ever applyed his mind to sensuall affections, replyed; D ÿmeliora : "Heaven forefend, a Strumpet should put on a Tragick Buskin. These continent Relations will reduce thy stragling motions to a more setled and retired harbour. And surely, did we but know what Honour takes her repose in so sweet an Harbour ; wee would soone strike Anchor. First then, wee will here  466 shew to you what Honour is to be ascribed to Continence . How much the very Pagans (whose desires onely clos'd in Morall Honesty) valued this precious Jemme. How votive Virgins chused rather to be deprived of Life, than of their Honour. And how those who violated that religious Vow, suffer'd the very extreamest kind of Censure: Whereof Campus Martius was ever 467 made the Tragicke Theatre, I leave to those who have writ amply of that Subject. Memorable is the Story of that noble Lady Armenia ; who being bidden to King Cyrus Wedding, went thither with her Husband: at Night when they were returned home, her Husband asked her, how she liked the Bridegroome; whether she thought him to be a faire and beautifull Prince or no? "In truth, said she, I know not: for all the while I was forth, I cast mine eyes upon none other but upon 'thy selfe. One of Hi ero's Enemies reproaching him with a stinking breath, went home and questioned his Wife why shee told him nothing thereof: but what was her Reply? I thought, quoth she, all men had the same savour. To continue the Memory of their Conjugall Constancy and Nuptiall Continence, you shall ever in these Creatures of the weaker Sexe, finde admirable Motives both for Instruction and Imitation. Cannia , Wife to Synattus , whom one Syneris , a man of greater Authority than he, loved; and making no small meanes by prayer, price, and power to obtaine her love, yet all in vaine; supposed the readiest way for the effecting his desires to be the murd'ring of her Husband: which he performed: and no sooner executed, than hee renewed his Suite, to which she seemed to assent. But being solemnely come into the Temple of Diana for the celebrating those Nuptiall Rites, she had a sweet potion ready which she drunke to Synoris : wherewith they both were poisoned; to revenge her Husbands death. The like admirable Constancy shew'd Theogena Wife to Agathocles , in her Husbands greatest misery; approving her selfe most his owne, when hee was relinquish't and forsaken of his owne: promising him, that she would not partake with him onely in prosperity, but in what fortune soever should befall him. That constant Loialty, and royall Continency of the incomparable Zenobia to her Husband Odonatus (though a Barbarian Queene) cannot be too much admired; her Zeale shee exprest not onely to him living, but dying. No Monument she held sit to containe his Corpse but her owne body; that carrying his shrine still about her (being what she could not remove from her) shee might ever reteine him in her memory. But no question, her princely affection to History had highly increased in her this Loialty. For by her reading of others what appeared in others so truely commendable, with a pious ambition shee aspired to an imitation thereof in her selfe. The Women of India (whether wonne with strength of Custome, or Conjugall Devotion) when any of their Husbands dyeth, are wont to fall into Contention through the vehemency of their affection, which of them (for they are permitted to have many Wives) hee loved best in his life: Shee that winneth, being very joyfull (a great Company of her Friends and Kinsfolke following her, to celebrate her funerall honour) is cast into the fire with her dead Husband. But every Crates must not looke to be Polycrates : such Cognizants must not be for every mans sleeve. That Sentence ever deserves approvement: "As there is a pleasure in loving those to whom we are espoused, living; so it is an office of piety to honour them dying. Their life injoynes us to be true to their Bed, their Death exacts no lesse to their memory. Nor in this Continence held onely in esteeme with those who partake of Reason: for even such Creatures as are led by Sense, are no lesse jealous of their Love, nor lesse speedy in revenging Lust: which may be confirmed by this Example. 468 A certaine libidinous Citizen dwelling in the Towne of Sybaris , bounding upon the River Crathis , so monstruously and unnaturally raged in the heate of immoderate Lust, as on a time, neglecting all humanity, to extinguish the violent flames of his bestiall affection, came to a Shee-goat and coupled with her; which the High-goat, as one seeing, yet reserving revenge for a fitter time, he found this Sybarite one day fast asleepe; wherefore to redresse the injury of his corrupted Love, and revenge the horrour of his detested Lust, he presently set upon him, and mall'd him to death with his hornes. But to close all in one; what Honour the Ancient Romans with other Ethnicks, ascribed to Continence : and how much they scorned that the least blemish should be aspersed on their House in that kind, may be made as cleare as light by that memorable Example of Virginius . The Story is thus. Virginius , one of a Plebeian descent, but of a Patritian spirit, lest his House should be dishonoured, spared not his owne blood. For when Appius Claudius , one of the Decem-viri , sought with strong hand to deflower his Daughter, being a Virgin, Virginius brought her into the Market-place, and there kill'd her, chusing rather to be her Murtherer, undefiled,  469 than her Father, deflowred. Now, having showne you the Honour due to Continence ; I would have you in the second place to consider, how soone a precious Name is lost:  470 and with what difficulty regain'd. It is not sufficient for you to refraine onely from doing ill, but from doing ought that may be suspected for ill. Variety of Examples you shall finde every where in this kind. A Name highly priz'd, and quickly lost: and being lost, not the wealth of the Indies could redeeme. Thirdly, reflect upon the pleasure how short it  471 is: and of the purchase, what shame it is. Demosthenes could answer La is deare demmand for so short a pleasure, " I will not buy Repentance at so deare a rate . And a farre more precious gage he had to lose, if an Ethnick light could have mounted so high. With the like Answer sleight every light Courtezans proffer; ascribing to that inestimable Jewell of Continence all due Honour. But yet I must proceed further, art thou Ambitious , and hast both wings and will to flye? Thou art soaring with Icarus , and thy waxen wings (no question) must be dissolved with Icarus : he gave a Sea a name; but thou hast a Sea in thine owne braine; thou art floting, and ( Camelion -like) feedest upon the aire of thine owne fancy: Thou art now for building a second Pyramides in the aire; and no doubt but thou wouldst perfect thy intentions, if death prevent thee not. Thou art a vaine Foole, thou seest many worthy honouring, daily declining, merits undeserving, raised to height above themselves: not a Senator, or sage Purple Father, but subjected to an undeserving censure: and what is the cause? Why, honour procureth censure; and yet thou art well, served well, safely retired, not envied, nor maligned by the opposites of greatnesse; and yet thou desirest (like another Ph aebus ) to shine in the eye of the Court, to shew thine owne admiration by a vaine flourish, commenting on thine owne perfections, which need some Exposition: for they cannot demonstrate themselves. Alas, how strangely art thou transported above thy selfe! not apprehending how the meanes of rising oft-times procure an unexpected fall. Consider thy owne unbridled desires, and seeke to represse them, I pray thee doe; and take this observance with thee: Never looke into either moderne Histories or Ancient, for the projects, how they grounded the foundation of their plots; but aime at the end and event of their designes, what issue they had: there thou shalt see a C aesar reigne long, and attaine the very height of his hopes; yet his continuance abridged, and his new-established Monarchy (in himselfe) quite  472 ruinate in a stabbe. Here a Sejanus (who was Ferox sceleris ) a great hunter after cruelty, become the last of his aspiring desires, and the sponge (as Tacitus observeth) who being squized, only enriched his Emperours fortunes, and made himselfe miserable by his owne fall: for Ambitious men, who leap to greatnesse, for the most part, hoppe without heads, and too late repent their madnesse. \------------------------------ themselves, then I have allotted my selfe. Proceed I must to my third branch, The particular profit 473 which redounds to every private state or family, from discourses of this nature . I know that the natural depravation of Man is such, as that he fixeth his mind upon that, which (for the most part) conferres least profit, and most delight: this is lively exemplified even in Historical Discourses; where we shall see men (for the most part) rather addicted to fabulous Travailes, the Survey of strange and never-heard of Ilands, prodigious sights, Monsters, Chymera's, and meere imaginary fancies, then to such narrations as might minister instruction and benefit to every particular Reader. Some we see delighted with the strange and incredible miracles of Mandevill: 474 others with the victorious combats of our Bevis of Southampton : others, more conversant with the Tragick Histories of our time (prodigies in part meerely invented.) And last of all (which in my judgement is worst of all) others with the phantastick writings of some supposed Knights;  475 ( Don Quixotte Transformed into a Knight with the Golden Pestle ) with many other fruitlesse inventions, moulded only for delight without profit. These Histories I altogether exclude my Oeconomy , or private Family; I have culd out more beneficiall Discourses for youth to employ themselves withall; producing a subject from the pure Cabinet of Truth: not from the braine of every Quack-salver, that runs out his inventions by selling lyes at grosse- sale. \------------------------------ benefited by Translators, as the Neat-heard in his Hovell may discourse as well of Cornelius Tacitus (if he know his mothers tongue) as our best Latinists . In my opinion no Argument better for instruction then that Author: and if I should dwell upon one, I had rather insist upon his phrases (though seemingly perplexed) then any other Roman Author,  476 how perspicuous soever. Tranquillus writes true, but he unrips the immodesties of the time with too long discourse upon every particular vice. Nothing (sayth Quintilian ,) can be esteemed more perfect, then the elegancy and brevity of Salusts speech ( Presertim apud vacuas & eraditas aures; ) and I assent to his opinion; the singularity of his phrase was (which may seeme strange) without affectation: so Aulius 477 Gellius (a very Aristarchus for the search of Antiquities) testifieth of him. Neither Fabius affraid to entitle him, The chiefe of the Roman Historians , as Thucidides the Prince of the Grecians . Yet in these Histories there is an exactnesse of understanding required; and more doe their writings conduce to State-affaires, then private and Domestick employment. Now, to deliver our judgement of divers approved Historians: extracted from the best Authors:  478 Titus Livius , by the testimony of Phil. Commines , as he is to this day had in great honour by the Italians , who retaine still a forme of the Antient Roman Government, and that in some poynts most exactly; describes in a sweete and well-composed Style, how that flourishing Empire (which afterwards swallowed up many eminent States) sprung up at first, how it increased, what was done commendably, what viciously, during the whole progresse of her rising; till labouring of her owne weight, and prest downe with her owne Grandeure, her full light fell to be eclyps'd, her height to a declining. Of this Historian, I have spoke in many places; yet me thinkes there is still something omitted that might bee properly annexed for an additament to his praise. Right well I know (to close in opinion with Erasmus ) "that there is no reading more accommodate, no Discourse better suiting men of quality than that of History ; amongst which Titus Livius holds the prime place (I speake of Latine Historians onely) especially, seeing nothing  479 is extant of Salusts , but onely two fragments. In his judgement, then, as no Discourse is more requisitely familiar than with Historians; so he holds Livie to be the Prince of all Latine Historians: and fittest to be a Gentlemans acquaintance. Great, no question, was his modesty; his owne Workes may confirme it: "Whether (saith he) I shall performe that Taske which may seeme worthy my Labour, if I relate whatsoever hath beene done by the people of Rome from the first foundation of that City, neither doe I sufficiently know, neither if I did know, durst I attempt such an enterprise. And yet he proceeded in that Labour, and perfected it with great honour: albeit, his pious feare exprest the sweetnesse of his temper. Neither fell he short in Sincerity, though he seemingly pretended a feare, which implide his modesty. For what is rare in Historians, (especially, writing of Princes and their Actions, in their owne times) hee was never taxed of partiality, nor mincing truth: were the Personages of whom he wrote never so great, nor authority in office high. A Subject, indeed, never worthy the penne of of so deserving an Historian; none could possibly have: nor more variety of actions both in a calme and troubled State. And though Authors in their arguments of Discourse and Historicall Relation finde ever the largest fields to walke in, to be fields of blood: where no day can passe without some notable action deserving the memory of a succeeding age; yet in that time and state wherein, he bestowed his paines, the retiredst houres from imployment afforded him an occasion of delivering some Observation or other worthy the approvement of a judicious Eye. For his Style (as I have else-where noted) it was nothing so darke nor concise as that of Tacitus . The former more dilated; the latter more contracted. Both serious; the latter more sententious. These ground the first face or foundation of a State upon Lawes; and they shew with what obedience those were observed in their infancy. Romulus and Remus were both builders; the one materiall, the other mentall. Numa begot in His both love and loyalty, by bringing His to understand themselves legally. Now, no sooner have they planted a State, then they beginne to strengthen it with Actions. Desire of Command calls them abroad. Their Powers must be levied, Commanders elected, and those Wars' made sinnewy and strong, that some exploit worthy the name of such a Nation may be performed. And having now presented the body of a State in her full growth, they shew what is done, not without due attributes to them, by whom those actions were done. They runne into commendation of those Agents of Valour, and they conclude; "Such as the Captaine is, such is the Souldier. They bring in Scipio , who used to have this Sentence in his mouth: "That easie, favourable  & affable Captaines were profitable to the enemy, which though they were beloved of their Souldiers, yet they set little by them. This, so wise and experienst a Commander could not chuse but make good use of: for the obedience of Scipio's Souldiers towards their Generall is confirmed by his owne attestation: "So  480 observant were mine of whatsoever I commanded them, that if I bad them clime to the toppe of a Tower, and from thence throw themselves head-long into the Sea, there was not one of them but would obey me. There is no passage to enliven the Spirit of a Souldier, which these omit: and all these couched in so Princely a Style, as without affectation, it comprehends much State. In a word, time shall sooner cease to breath, than posterity to breath their fame. For the Epitomes of these, as Luc. Florus and others; me thinkes they may bee compared to short Commons. They doe well so farre as they goe; but they leave the Reader still with a strong Appetite. Something is ever omitted, which leaves the Stomacke craving and unsatisfide. It is true indeede, that such Collections are usefull for memory: like briefe Notes or Diaries, which we carry about with us: And for ordinanary Discourse, will serve well enough. But a Schollers Historicall Taske is of more difficulty, than to receive life and spirit from an Epitome. The judiciousest and most compendious Epitomizer breathing, should he Analise an entire History; and after many serious re-views and recollections, contract the whole body thereof into a briefe Methodicall Compendiary: So farre short should he find himselfe fall from the mind of the Author: as upon the next re- view, he would ingenuously confesse, that he had rather runne over him, than conversed with him. For Gellius , his Discourse rather falls upon Philosophicall argumentation, than any Historicall relation. Winter Nights you shall finde there well bestowed. And he Styles them Athenian Nights , to expresse how those Studies with which Athens most flourished, were there sociably debated, Scholastically argued, and judiciously composed. Some Pieces of Naturall History are heere and there interveined, which may minister occasion both of profit and delight to such as shall seriously peruse them. Touching Valerius Maxinius , his writings stand more upon Apothegmes than History . He takes Survey of such especiall Vertues and Vices as pressed most upon those times. Wherein, he recommends to posterity such memorable Persons as were Mirrours for the practise of the One; and rigid Censors in punishing the Other. He discovers nothing but by example; a moving kinde of perswasion for imitation of goodnesse; and aversion from whatsoever is evill. Quintus Curtius , his Sceane is single: his whole Discourse consists mainly upon the actions of one Prince; yet many pleasant and remarkable passages shall you finde in the Princely progresse of his life. A brave spirit displayed in every action. One, who knew how to vanquish; and how to moderate his felicity. One, who if he were not what he was, could chuse with all his heart to be a poor Philosopher. One, who amidst his Military affaires, and managements of State, would deagne to talke with learning: purposely to improve himselfe as well in Arts as Armes. Never Prince by his power could doe more, and by a sweet attemprature of his command, revengelesse. Megabizes esteemed Alexander as a Prince whilst he stood in his Schoole and said nothing, but when hee began to talke of things which he knew not: he said unto him, that "Even his little Children would laugh him to scorne. This affront could that great Commander beare with a Princely patience: and labour by his owne endeavour, and the instruction of an incomparable Master, to redeeme his ignorance. Though a Cynick teach him mortality in an homely manner: and encounter him with mouldred Sculls in his triumph to his Countrey; he will scarcely reprove him for it, but usefully apply it, and benefit more by it, than by all those Nations he had conquered. Yet must his Errours be touched, that the sincerity of an Historian may become approved. His easie inclining to La is lay no small taint nor tincture on his honour, that the counsell of a Wanton should get the Conquest of such a Conquerour. Velleius Paterculus , as he was no lesse elegant in his Style, than sinnowey and substantial in that Subject whereof he treated; may be justly bemoaned, that the injury of time should leave such maimes in his Workes: as no mention at all is made of all those glorious actions and memorable exploits of the Romans , from the very prime foundation of the City, till the ruine of the Macedonian Kingdome, by Æ milius , during the space of five hundred yeares or more. So as, what now remaines extant of him, shewes him not so full, as to the halfe Body : nor that neither in his owne native lustre and beauty. In a word, unhappy was he in his mutilation, more unhappy in his Translation. For Iosephus , that sincere relater of the Jewish Warres, I shall take occasion presently to speake of him; give mee leave onely to render him that commendation which Constantine the Emperour was sometimes pleased to bestow on so noble and faithfull an Historian: "As his life deserved perpetuall praise, so his death eternall honour. Touching Appianus Alexandrinus in his Discourse of the Romane affaires, in my judgement he shewes both wit and strength in his Lines. Not a pleasant passage but merits approvement from his Pen. None more serious, when he desires to be weighty; none more delightfull, when the Subject admits a freedome to be witty. For our Greeke Ethnick Historians (for of those Ecclesiasticall Writers, we shall speake of them in their due place;) none comparable to Plutarch for Historicall Morality; nor to Thucidides , for State and Majesty; nor to Herodotus , for Method and Perspecuity; nor to Herodian , for a quick and active Discovery; nor to Zenophon , for a rich Philosophicall Delivery. Where every Sentence workes strongly on the Sence, and begets some new Principle of Experience. But these, as I observed, wrote onely upon the Actions of those times, with the quality of the Persons interessed in those Actions: being both for matter of Discipline and service estranged from us, and consequently reteine lesse affinity with us. Yet of singular use (if discretion be had for severing the chaffe from the pure graine) both for instruction and exemplary direction to these times. I will retire my selfe to such as may yeeld the Reader no little profit by consideration had to the judgments of God, modestly mixing Morall instructions with a sweet variety of Divine discourse: a matter which may seeme directly opposite to my first intention, but is not so; for these Histories which I meane to produce, are so grounded upon infallible truths, as in that respect they may seeme to merit a morally-Divine  481 Title. Iosephus works I especially entertaine into my Family, as best describers of the judgements of God, expressers to the life, of an obdurate and stiffe-necked generation. Here to behold the incomparable beauty of that glorious Temple (the type of the Coelestiall Temple) founded by that wisest of men, and that peace of Princes, Salomon , defaced, and that City which was once called, The City of the great King , demolished,  482 and ayd levell with the ground. Then to direct our Eye to the wonderfull judgments of God in raising civill discords, and mutinies amongst the Iewes themselves, the greatest meanes of  483 their subversion, the maine predictions of their ruine and utter destruction, before these warres came upon them; yet their impieties not a whit lessened, their arme of sinne shortned, nor remorse of conscience excited: no refuge to the Religious, but defence to the wicked in every  484 place of the City ministred. Then Survey the pollution of that Sacred Temple, where Altars were once Erected, Peace-offering sacrificed, and the Prayers of the holy Consecrated to God; there nought but effussion of bloud, slaughters among themselves (an Occurrent remarkeable) committing no lesse Massacres upon themselves in the ceasing of Warre, then the Romans did in the heat of warre: being wholly exposed to Tyrannicall Factions in the City; to expose themselves to Roman servitude more easily. These examples of Gods Justice, are worthy our Observation, 485 to admonish us of our peculiar duties, careful how we offend, serious in the administration of Justice: For how should we think he will spare the wilde Vine, that hath thus dealt with his owne naturall Vine? When he hath dealt thus with the Greene Tree, what will he do with the Dry Tree? That Vine was planted with his owne Hand, watered with the dew of his especiallest favours from Heaven, dressed and pruned, yet behold the wilde Boare hath rooted it up: Etseges est ubi Troia suit. The truth of that History is so undoubted, as besides his owne concordance in relating, there is none that ever made question of the Truth and Verity thereof, composing what he wrote, not by report of Others, who speake (for most part) as they are affected, but by the approbation of his owne Eyes, the best outward directresses to inward knowledge. To this Noble Historian (for he was Nobly Discended) I may adde those excellent Greeke Writers, worthy and memorable: as Nicephorus ,  486 Evagoras, Socrates, &c . For their Divine Examples plentifull, the successe of the Christians amidst the tyrannies of the cruellest Emperours wonderfull: the diverse sorts of torments by those Tyrants invented, pittifull; and the dismall and terrible end of those Blood-suckers, fearefull. Here thou shalt see an Herod transported  487 above himselfe, with the acclamation of his people: Not the voyce of Man, but of God : And presently behold his pompe converted into loathsomnesse, his preceedent joy to a subsequent pensivenesse, and the excellency of admiration to a suddaine amazednesse, he that seemed before a God, and no Man, is now by God made the miserablest of Man, forlorne and dejected: nay, if we would observe the whole current of their  488 Histories, we shall see in them that God ever used to recompence the Offendour with a punishment of the like nature: Nicephorus reports, how  489 Herodias daughter having begged the head of Iohn Baptist , chanced on a time to go over a main river, frozen over with Ice, where the Ice presently parting received her, and meeting againe cut  490 off her head, a true and evident Testimony of Gods judgment. The like of that blasphemous wretch Iulian , a foule-mouth'd detractor from the glory of God: who on a time mocked a Christian for talking reverently of the bowels of Christs compassions: But what end came of this miserable Atheist?  491 His bowels fell out of his belly, being thrust through with a Javeling, confessing the power of God with a regreate, saying: Vicisti O Galilee! &c . yet vouch safing to bestow no better name on him, then Galilean , a fearefull end of a most prophane Blasphemer. The like of Dioclesian that cruell Emperour (and a great persecutor of the Christians) who, whilst he raigned seemed little or nothing to feare the Divine power of Heaven; yet the History records, that Feare was the greatest occasion of his death; no, that he died by a voluntary feare, very jealous of the Aire, lest it should pierce his Braine. The like of Maximinus , who at that time  492 raged in the East, as Maxentius did in the West. Of whose Cruelties to returne a full Catalogue, would require an ampler Discourse than I have reserved for him. Hee, I say, who accumulated upon himselfe these Tides: "Emperour C aesar, "Maximinus , puissant, magnificent, Chiefe Lord, Lord of Thebais , Lord of Sarmatia , five times Conquerour of Persia , Lord of Germany , Lord of Æ gypt , twice Conquer or of the Carptans , sixe times Conqueror of the  493 Armenians , Lord of the Medes , Lord of the Adiabeni , Twenty times Tribune, Nineteene times generall Captuine, Eight times Consul, Father of the Countrey, Proconsul,  &c. This matchlesse Tyrant, thus swolne up with Titles, after such time as he had plenteously rioted in the blood of the Saints, and sleighted the power of Heaven: feasted in nothing more than the bloody Bankets of dislaughter'd Christians. "Wherefore a Plague from above lighted on him, first taking roote in his flesh, and afterwards proceeding even unto his Soule. For there arose suddenly in the secret parts of his body (to chastise him for his licentious impurity) an Imposthume or running Sore, afterwards in the lower parts of his privities a borchy corrupt Bile, with a Fistula; whence issued out corrupt matter, eating up the inward bowells, and an unspeakable multitude of Lice swarming out, and breathing a deadly stinch,  494 when as the Corpulency of the whole body through abundance of meate before the disease came, was turned into superfluous grosnesse; and then being growne to matter, yeelded an intollerable and horrible Spectacle to the beholders. Wherefore of the Physitians, some not able to digest that wonderfull any sour stinch, were slaine: some other (when there remained no hope of Recovery, by reason of the swelling through out the whole body) being not able to helpe at all with their Physicke, were cruelly executed themselves. But let us (if you please) take a Summary or briefe Survey (the benefit will answer the pursuit) how those Emperours which were Ethnicks and Panims, maintainers of Idolatry and Paganisme; and how of the contrary, such as cleaved unto the Christian Faith, and held it there royall'st Prerogative to be Defenders of it, ended their Reigne. Was not C aeius Iulius Caesar the first Emperor, slaine by Conspiracy? Did not certaine Souldiers with naked Swords dispatch Caius the Nephew of Tiberius ? Was not Nero murdered by one of his familiar and deare Friends: Had not Galba the like end, Otho and Vitellius who all three reigned onely sixteene Moneths? What shall I speake of Titus , whom Domitianus poisoned, although he was his owne Brother? What say you of Commodus , did not Narcissus dispatch him out of the way? What shall I speake of Pertinax , and what of Iulian , enjoyed not both they one kind of Death? What, did not Antonius the Sonne of Severas murther his Brother Geta . And did not Martialis require him with the like? What shall I say of Macrinus ? did not the Souldiers use him like a Captive about Bizantium , and cruelly put him to death? Was not Aurelius Antonius of Emessa murthred together with his Mother? Was not Alexander immediately after him, together with his Mother likewise put to death? What shall I say of Maximinus (whom we formerly mentioned) whom his owne Army dispatched? Or of Gordianus , who through the Treason of Philip was in like sort by his owne Souldiers put to death? Tell me, I pray thee thy selfe O Zosimus , what happened unto Philip , and after unto Decius , were they not slaine by the Enemy? Take Gallus and Volusianus with them, were they not murthered by their owne Armies? What of Æ milianus , had not he the like miserable end: What Valerianus , was not he taken by the Persians in Battell, and led about of them in Triumph? What Galienus ? was he not slaine through Treason, and Carinus beheaded when Dioclesian came to be Emperor; whom Dioclesian cut off lest they should Reigne with him? After whom Herculius Maximianus , his sonne Maxentius , and Licinius dyed with contumely and shame enough. But since the time most noble Emperor Constantine began to reigne, since hee consecrated unto God the City he had built, and called it after his owne name, looke about I pray you, and speake indifferently, was there any one Emperour in that City ( Iulian , whose Apostacy exposed him to an imperious Tyranny, onely excepted) that was murthered, either by his owne Subject, or by the Enemy: or any other Tyrant vanquished the Emperour, Basiliscus excepted: who, although he thrust Zeno beside the Imperial Scepter, he was overcome of him againe, and lost his head. These Examples extracted from infallible grounds, may seeme the judicious understanding of the Gravest, and fittest for Private Families, where order is best attained by Examples: We use most to be moved, when we see the end of such a Man, to caution us; who having led his  495 life securely, concludes the period of his dayes as miserably: And some have I knowne even of the discreetest and most vertuous parents, who, to deterre their children from Drunkennesse, used (like as the Epirotes did with their children) to  496 hang the picture of a Hog wallowing in a filthy puddle, with this Inscription on it: Nunc Ebrius astet, 497 Mequ e Suem sumpsisse suam formam \--- Drunkard, if thou wouldst see this forme of thine, 498  Come here and see't depictur'd in a Swine. The Lascivious and sensuall worldling, decyphered  499 with this Character: Myrrha hanging in 500 a chaine of gold about her father Cyneras bed' with this Impressa. Hinc Amor ut tenuit, suspender. The miserable wretch that makes his gold his God, best expressed by Menedemus , with his Spade, delving and digging for life, with this Motto: 501 Sic mihi divitias Famuliq pati. Truest decyphering of all ices, proceeding from the exemplary events of Delinquents, committing what they like, and at last feeling what they like not: The best government in private, proceeds  502 from Histories, and the serious reading thereof: the vertuous Matron squaring her course, by that modestest of Romane Dames Lucretia , making her ( colum her thorum ) her Distaffe, her best companion in her bed, when her husband was absent: no vicious mind can deprave her, she is fighting at home with her owne passions, whilst Colatine her husband fights in the field against his Countries enemy: But you shall see Lentulus and Aruns , their wives rioting, and revelling in their husbands absence. You shall finde sundry Instructions highly  503 conducing to all Private Estates, in these Surveys of Histories . Directions for those are married; how to demeane themselves in their severall ranks or conditions. How the Roman Dames, after they had taken them to Husbands, were to bid adue to publique concourse: by breaking of the Axle-tree of their Waggons at their Bridegroomes doore: and putting off their shooes, (implying, that they were thenceforth to keepe within doores, and never to goe abroad.) What Instructions likewise were given them, to prepare them before they tooke themselves to a married state; which (to omit others lesse pertinent) were digested in this sort: 504 Love all, but reserve your peculiar affection to One. Hate whatsoever deserves your pious neglect:  505 and entertaine that Subject, as one worthy your truest tender, who would rather dye than asperse the least blemish on your honour. Hold him dearer than your life, who knows  506 the essence of Love: who scornes to make a Semblance of that in Act or Tongue, which his intimatest thoughts confirme not for a truth. Piety should be your Diary: Sanctity your  507 Deity. Earth your contempt: Elysium your content.  508 Let this be your Object, that your Subject: That your Inne, this your Mansion. You are yet but one selfe, one Soule: if ever  509 you live to unite it, let it be linked to such a Love, as may essentially delight it: ever cheere it, never cloy it. The misery of an enforced Marriage, what  510 Tragick effects it h'as wrought, the World can witnesse: where joyning of hands comming from dis-joyned hearts, hath made many a Nuptiall, an heavy Funerall. Portion is a Worldings Object: Beauty the amorous  511 Fooles Darling. Whereas, Vertue, be she never so poore, nor to the outward eye never so meane; reteines in her what may truely enrich those that shall have her: and expresse that beauty in Age, which farre surpasseth all others in their Prime. You, whose happinesse it hath ever beene to  512 gaine repute; crowne those rayes of your Morning, with a glorious Evening. And to ripen those native seeds of goodnesse in you, make choice of such an one for your Mate, whose knowledge may improve you; that Art and Nature may make you such an absolute Creature, as whosoever eyes you, may admire you: and draw one line from your accomplishment, whereby they may imitate you. 513 Though you be left, while others are chosen, hold not this your Contempt but Honour. Heavens have reserv'd you for the last Dish, to season the palate of a select Guest. Those Jewells are not in value least, that are vended last. 514 Your affection hath beene long in planting: those are the best Foundations. 515 That madding Fancy is a Frency, where Deliberation makes no entry. 516 You have observed others choice; yet you preferred your Maiden-state before any change. A Marriage-day could not so fire your affection; as to beget in you one straying thought of altering your condition. What a fixt Resolve was this in Youth? you were no envious Corrivall in others Rites; but were pleased to see others fed, with what you never tasted; harmlesly joying to heare others joy in that you never enjoyed. But being so well read in Man, yet never  517 knowne to Man, make use of your Lecture, and in a lawfull embrace give way to Nature. Let your Posterity make you a Mother; your  518 breeding beget a new life in those who shall be got of you: that like tender Osiers twisted about you, they may become melodious Instruments to those Superiour Powers that made you. To whose auspicious protection in the choice of your affection, that you may never stand in need of Viri-placa's -Mediation, we recommend you. The like Directions you shall finde for Virgins, and such as embraced a single life: with sundry Morall Motives to exhort Widdows to Continence. Instructions likewise for Oeconomicall Discipline: Experimentall grounds or Observations for Husbandry; all which for Brevity sake I passe over, referring you to such who have copiously  519 inlarged themselves in Subjects of this nature. If our Historians, now a daies, would employ their Lampes and Oyle in the delivery of a profitable History, such as might rather tend to the cherishing of the unripened blossomes of vertue, then the nipping of them: How happy members were they? Yea, that I may use Salusts words, though they retired themselves from publick affaires,  520 yet; Majus commodum exeo otio, qu amex aliorum negotys Reipub. venturum : Yet such have bin the depraved humours of former times, that the best Observors and Relators, have purchased little, save Envy, for their Labours: no, the very chiefest Historians have opposed themselves one against another. 521 Titus Livius was so violent against poore Salust (as Seneca observeth) as he objected that certaine things, Transcribed by Salust out of Thucidides , though elegantly applyed, yet by him depraved and corrupted; which Aurelius Fuscuss also, noteth to be done, as it were, of set purpose by Salust , to derogate from the excellency of Thucidides writings: A meere detraction to such a worthy Author: But what workes meriting Emulation, have not ever had Envy for their attendants? I conceive the reason to proceed 522 from that of Hesiod , who inferreth in Professions, none to be more apt to envy one another, then such as be of one Trade: Figulus figulumodit : True, for where eyther singularity is required, or hope of gaine, there Envy is ever shooting her impoisoned Arrowes: and (for the most part) Envy raigneth there most, where our Labours deserve most: The low Mushrome is seldome touched by the violence of any Tempest, but the peering Cedar is ever exposed to all vehemencies. For the particular use of Histories, and their fruit, I have gathered these Observances, extracted  523 from a judicious Writer: Expert he was in all Historiall Relations, as his apt similitudes more fully demonstrate: what they are I have here set downe, and as contractedly (as I could imagine) for the benefit of every understanding Reader. If History comprehend in it any certaine documents  524 for the instruction of Mans life, I suppose it expedient for all men, as well to select and make use of it, as to rush violently into such most plentifull and fruitfull fields of History, where all exemplary grounds are in ample sort propounded. For what can be more pleasant, or more profitable, then in the Theatre of Mans life; so, to be made wary and wise by other mens harmes (and that without harme) as to sit in safety, and yet to be instructed in all parts without jeopardy: chusing out Examples of all kind, which thou maist apply unto thy owne peculiar use, upon all occasions? And whereas History, is conversant oftentimes in the secretest counsels, importing the weightiest affaires of the greatest Persons: we that are men do with greatest appetite covet them, as likewise to be interressed in their events, because it is impossible (through the shortnesse of mans life) otherwise to abridge the successions of times, by the limit of our forgetfull memory: or to see the prosperous Fortunes, Successes, and Ends of Empires, or manifestly to conceive the Causes of evils, eyther private or publicke; or in every hard and difficult assay, to have a president before our eyes, of such things as were tryed before us, or which were in hazard before they were attempted by us: and that I may speake all in one word; to judge of things present, by things past, which is the property of a wise man, and discreetly to foresee of what is to come by all succeeding events. But it becommeth us, to come so much the better furnished, by how much our History is with all fruits better fraught and replenished: And whereas there is the very same difficulty in judging rightly, as well of our owne, as anothers life; there is none that can duly (how piercingey'd soever) judge of anothers life, that hath not measured his owne: Of both sides it is to be implyed, that not onely a maine difficulty is here placed, but also before we be to this History addressed, it is required necessarily, that we be not only endued with a certaine Civill Wisdome and Moderation, but also to have our lives grounded on a setled intention, unlesse we will be miserably, and that perpetually, deluded with the vaine illusions of this life. 525 For even as it fares in a most sumptuous and royall Banket, replenished with all sorts of dainties, one thing seemes delightfull to one which is distastfull to another; few things are liked of all, every one being best pleased with his owne, though all dishes be alike to the Glutton: and as every one's appetite is, so is he affected; yet there is a meane (which Nature hath ordained) and a certaine kind of nourishment, which in it selfe is meerely simple and uncorrupted, and best agreeing with our bodies: From which, whosoever departeth so, as he crammeth himselfe above the bounds or determination of Nature, will find more inconveniency then profit in it. So in this diversity of Mans life, though there be a thousand formes, and a thousand purpose, and as every one is resolved in mind and judgment, so he judgeth of his owne and anothers life: yet there is one only path of vertue, which whosoever keepeth and observeth wisely, he only maketh use of his life really. Others[illeg.] as in a doubtfull supper, when they invite themselves to all pleasures, can neyther find out in themselues or others what might deserve imitation, or whereto they make might recourse: But if there be anything given to man by Nature, which is in his power to use well or ill, it behoveth him to use great circumspection in the use thereof: But what is he I pray thee, that wil use more exact consideration in all his words and workes (by the direct line of vertue) then in the use of such meats as are set before him? And who thinkes not himselfe sufficiently instructed herein? In which how wonderfully are men deceived? Supposing that Discourse to be History, which teacheth the Reader, ministring to him matter of Learning (yet so) as a Banket ministreth use and appetite to every one as he is affected. This is the reason that we see some so delighted with the sweetnesse of Reading, as obeying their owne pleasure, they loose the inestimable fruits thereof. Such have no other scope in all Histories, then with which our Generous Musitians, use to passe time away, upon their Instruments: employed in reading only, to spend their weary houres, which be presently encountred with more wearisomnesse: For there is no pleasure in it, which 526 hath no reference to Vertue . The glittering object of glory and ambition exciteth others, and that which shewes a flexibility of mind in all other things, vainely transports them to every brave  & eminent image, forgetful how glorious and remarkable examples are produced by Writers; not only to follow vertue, and contemne honour offered us; but if a Competitor were admitted us to counter maund the authority of our honour, to endure him with patience; yet, though none but fooles will purpose to aspire to such merited excellence, without the like meriting vertue: we see many men, by the very reading of excellent things, to taste in themselves a certain kind of excellency, arrogating much to themselves, and resembling those Tragedians, who imitate the State of such persons they represented, after they have put off their Habits. There be also (but of these there be but a few) whom new, and unaccustomed things do delight (men of vulgar apprehension) who learning the State of Emperonrs, for the most part, more esteeme the Purple then the Man, the Picture then  527 the Work: So effectualla force doth History exercise, and imprint in the Mind of the Reader. Now it is the scope, and draught of all Histories to excite mans sloath, and to arme him against all dangers, and whereas the force of examples (then which nothing can be imagined more powerful to perswade) tend especially to that end; it commeth to passe that by the security of men (who thinke other mens harmes little or nothing to concerne them) such things (as in themselves are memorable and worthy observation) be read and heard with a deafe and carelesse Eare. To be briefe, there be some also (which one would hardly thinke) offend in a more severe, and Criticke kind of reading: as if things should not be Writ as they were done, but as they ought to have beene done. Wherefore, partly by this curiosity, partly by that security (the very surfeit of confused and rash reading) it commeth to passe (as in a body pestred with corrupt humors) that a certaine ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , or ill disposition of judgment and opinion, which ought especially to be found and sincere in the course of our life, and a ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , or bad temperature, converting all food into ill humours, useth to be contracted in us: and as meat availeth such as be distempered, nothing, so no profit at all by these meanes is ministred to our reading. I suppose thou seest how the very same reason is in reading History, and disposing the course of thy life: but this is certainly the greatest difficulty (to wit) the perversenesse of our judgment, which is the speciall'st cause, that we are not moved with examples as we ought, but what way as our minds are inclined and affected most. And this difficulty is no lesse then the other: forasmuch as Writers do describe things done, as they do not only carry favour, but follow their owne appetites (like some Builders) ever interposing their own peculiar judgments, (of their owne accord)  528 praising some things, (though not praiseworthy;) and whatsoever liketh them, they imagine it worthy approbation: which (surely) if they did simply, it were easie to consent or dissent unto them. But even as cookes (for the most part) do more respect their Maisters Palate then  529 his Profit: Even so an Historian (I could wish the most did not so) applies himselfe to the appetite of the Reader. We are oft-times therefore deluded by these two meanes, our owne Judgement, and the prejudice of the Author, not laying things open and naked, as they were done. An Historian is the best interpreter of Acts archieved; whose judgment, if it chance to be corrupt, it commeth to passe, as when Wine (of it selfe neate and generous) taketh either some wast of the Caske, or is corrupted by some other distast, which either proceeds from an imposture, or folly great  & intollerable. We may see in one only example, the judgment of the Writer; The prophane Historian ascribeth the events of serious and weighty affaires, to the councell and industry of men; al-be-it he hath sufficiently tried, how fowly those men were deceived in the events. Hence it is that men be drawne to great folly; that they, whose knowledge was scarce sufficient for the consideration of things subjected before their eies; and whose force and strength not much exceeded little Wormes, should by one small successe arrogate the government of the whole world unto them. But a good Historian teacheth thus: Things (saith he) are purposed by Man, but disposed, and moderated by God ; whereby he riddeth the scrupulous Reader both of folly and superstition (a mischiefe no lesse then the other;) and in all other proprieties, good Historians (whose studies are only consecrated to holinesse) ought not to be ignorant of the Agent and Instrument wherein they differ, and what be their severall Effects: the one moving, and the other moved. But especially I admonish thee to this end; that whereas I observe many Authors of that kind, who for their exceeding force of innumerable examples, deserve to be read; I could wish that the Novice-reader discusse with himselfe as circumspectly and seriously as he can, by proposing to himselfe both the fruits which might redound, and the dangers which might occurre him in his reading: for to one that runneth over all Histories cursorily, or who rashly and unadvisedly spends his time without any exact observance of private or publicke duties, it commeth to passe as to Country Clownes, who in sacking of a neighbour City, take spoile of some Apothecaries shop well furnished with all receipts; where, provoked with the sweetnesse of some junkets or spices, being the first that came to their hands, and imagining the rest to be of the same sort, they swallow, sup up, devoure, and gormandize all before them; whereby presently some are taken with a strange disease, others with a Phrensie, most are berest of life; none but strangely distempered, which occasions laughter through all the Army: For as Mans life, (so History the Image of Mans life) hath her commodities and discommodities: for the Government of Mans life consisteth onely in the use of his life. In these Collections as in a most cleare Mirror, may our young Gallant see into his errours: he shall be of necessity forced to distaste himselfe, till he have relinquished his mid-night revels, surceased from his licentious meetings, and reduced his disconsorting Passions unto a calme and retired harbour ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  here the publicke Magistrate shall be able to dispose of himselfe, and Office deputed unto him; seeing matters worthy imitation, and Precepts worthy the Gravest and Ripest Consideration: one to instruct, others to Correct, and all to make perfect this whole module of Man. Now, to take a review of those former Collections,  530 and apply them to our present occasions; Histories you have heard illustrated by divers proper Similitudes, to represent uncous the benefit thereof, both in respect of their delight, being modestly and discreetly seasoned; as likewise, the occasional profit we may make therof; in the passages of this life. First then, he compares History to a Feast or Banket , where Dishes of all sorts are provided and orderly disposed; implying, what Method is to be observed in the forme or digestion of an History . Nither, indeed, could any Viands bee more orderly disposed, nor decently dished, than hath beene observed by our Historiographers in the comely disposition of their Writings: So well hath the Divine providence ordered, that whatsoever properly conduced either to the knowledge or practise of this life, might to Posterity bee successively recommended. For first, to descend to the Order and Continuance of times agreeable to the Ecclesiasticall History, we have at this day compendiously delivered unto us by the Workes of such famous Historiographers as have written the said History unto the posterity following. For Eusebius Pamphilus hath written from the birth of Christ unto the reigne of Constantinus Magnus: Socrates, Theodoret , and Zozomen have continued the times from Constantine , unto Theodosius Iunior , of which Emperours doings Evagrius hath somewhat discoursed. As for the Divine and Prophane Histories from the beginning of the World unto this day, they are orderly continued by painfull Writers. And first of all, Moses beganne to Write (as is declared of them which compiled these things together) of the things that were done from the Creation of the World, even as he had truely learned of God in Mount Sina . Againe, other followed him; shewed the ready way to our Religion, and committed to Writing the Acts done since his time. Moreover (to descend as in a building from Story to Story) Iosephus wrote a very large Story, full of every kinde of good matter. What fabulous things soever have been reported to have beene done either by the Grecians or Barbarians of old time, who either were at Civill Warres within themselves, or waged battell with forraine enemies, or if any other thing can be remembred since the first mould of man was cast, all I say, besides sundry other Writers, is laid downe by Characes, Theopompus and Ephorus . As for the Roman History, comprizing in manner the Acts of the whole World, or if any other thing fell out by reason of their Civill discord or of quarrels risen betweene them and forraine Nations, it is exquisitely handled by Dionysius Halicarnassoeue , who begunne his Story from the time of the People called Aborigenes , and continued it to the reigne of Pyrrhus King of Epirus . From thence unto the overthrow of Carthage, Polybius Megapolitanus hath excellently discoursed: all which Treatises though occasioned at divers and sundry times, Appianus with grave judgement hath contrived into Order, and compacted together; adding thereunto of his owne, such things as were worthy of memory after their dayes unto his time. Diodorus Siculus wrote unto the time of Iulius C aesar, Dion Cassius likewise continued his Story unto the reigne of Antonius of Emesa . The like matter and order hath Herodian in manner followed, ending with the death of Maximus. Nicostratus also, a Rhetorician of Trapesus , beganne with the reigne of Philip the Successour of Gordianus , and wrote unto Odonatus of Palmyra , and the ignominious expedition of Valerianus against the Persians . Of the same thing intreated Dexippus at large, beginning with the reigne of the Macedonians , and ending with the Empire of Claudius , the Successor of Galienus . The said Author laid downe the Warres of the Carpians , and of other Barbarians in Hellada, Thracia and Ionia. Eusebius continued his Story from Octavianus the Emrours reigne, unto the time of Traian, Marcus , and the death of Carus. Arianus and Asinius Quadratus , wrote somewhat also of those times. The times following, reaching unto the reigne of Arcadius and Honorius the Emperors, Zosimus hath prosecuted: and of the things which happened since their times, Priscus Rhetor with others hath discoursed. All which Histories Eustathius of Epiphania hath briefly runne over, but very excellently, and devided the whole into two Volumes: The first containeth the Acts from the beginning of the World unto the destruction of Troy and the Pallace of Priamus : the second continueth the Story from that time uuto the twelfth yeare of Anastasius the Emperours reigne. There beganne Procopius Rhetor , and ended with the dayes of Iustinian . What happened since unto these our dayes (saith Evagrius Scolasticus , a serious Discourser and Discusser of Antiquities) although Agathius Rhetor , and Iohn , both my fellow Citizen and Kinsman, have orderly written of, unto the time when Chosroes the younger both fled unto the Romans , and also was restored to his Kingdome by Mauricius , (who went not therein faintly to worke, but couragiously as it became an Emperour) and brought Chosroes into his Kingdome with great Treasure and Armed Souldiers) yet  531 have they not as yet published their Histories. Whence you may collect how orderly Histories have beene disposed, how successively continued, and with what coherence suited, as hath formerly beene observed. The chiefest of them, to reteine them better in memory (and right usefull is such Historicall retention) have beene ingeniously closed in this metricall Dimension. Baronius, Iovius, Polydorus , Dodon aeus, Diodorus , Dorotheus & Eusebius , Ptolom aeus & Polybius. Annexing to these: C aelius, Lelius, & Valerius , Cineas, Plinius, & Pererius. Now, (to tye our selves to that propriety of that Similitude used in our former Collections;) as in a Banket there be severall Dainties orderly dished, so be there appetites as diversly affected. What one distasteth, another relisheth; what one relisheth, another distasteth. So it fareth with our Readers of History. Some are for Solid meates; Serious Discourses, fit onely for strong Stomacks. Others are for meates of easie and light digestion. What may relish with the Palat, though it affords lesse nourishment, delights them best. Here a Comfit, there a Succot; onely Kix-showes are for these lighter Guests. And many shall we encounter withall of this sort: who, should you question them, what they have read in such an History, or what usefull Observance fit upon occasion, to be reduced to practise, they have gathered; it were to bee doubted, if they returne not the same answer, which that youthfull Reader of Homers Workes rendred (as one newly come out of an Euphuus golden slumber) to one questioning him in the like manner. "I find not a more pleasing Piece "than Helen , nor displeasing than Thersites . Many such there are, who take a perfecter view of the Picture , than of the Substance Poore mouldred earth, which sometimes (if Histories enlarge not themselves too farre) reteined a gracefull presence; and wrought such strong impressions in strange eyes, as they ingaged both their owne and Countries liberty, to become possessors of such a beauty, are attractivest Objects of their eyes, the retentivest Subjects for their memories. These come for company, amongst the more knowing and deserving Guests, to partake of this Banket ; but they preferre such sweete Meates, which corrupt rather than nourish, before those which may not onely close the Appetite, but supply for nourishment. Others, more seriously affected, hold to that which may most nourish. These be our judicious Readers, who collect what may profit them in private Discourse, or affaires Domestick or Publick. To see an Eminent Personage beare himselfe to his ranke, we commend him; we say, hee does not degenerate from those he came from: his disposition proves his descent; his Education, the worthinesse of those that bred him. Observe this in your perusall of History ; when you finde a person nobly accomplish'd; One, who values honour before any worldly tender: you collect, he was not obscurely bred; his demerits pleade for him. No Herald can find for him a better Coate, than his owne personall worth. Now, reflect, Gentlemen , upon your selves. Doe you shew your selves abroad? Are you invited to publicke Feasts or other re-greets of friends? Tell me then, is not the Vessell to be knowne by the sound? Our vaporous Gallant, whose intimate acquaintance is his Tinder-boxe and a Pipe, takes in snuffe a serious Discourse. His entire Study is reduced into a small Volume; closing his Impresse with, Pulvis & umbra sumus. And these Emblemes of his Mortality though he carry still about him, he as easily forgets what they signifie, as if they had no relation to Mortality. Poor seered things! Can you see these, and not pitty them? Pieces made up in the shape of men, but so farre estranged from so Princely style, as, their feature excepted, they represent nothing lesse. Discourse, without that weake manuall instrument, their Pipe, they cannot: and when they utter what smoak gives them power to deliver: they reteine still that Embleme in their Dialect, which they evaporated from their Pipe, Smoake . The Judicious, I am sure, blush at this, and by a reflex of conceipt (to use the Philosophers words) are more ashamed of them, than they of themselves. For these conceive what a dishonour it were to them to shew themselves so childishly in a publicke Society. It is true, all dispositions are not alike affected; Seeing, as Plato saith, running Wits are delighted with Po etry, as Aristotle writeth, effeminate persons are ravished with Musick, and as Socrates telleth us, Histories agree best with stayed heads. This induced Alfonsus to have  532 alwaies in his besome the Commentaries of C aesar : being also so much delighted with the History of Titus Livius , that on a time he commanded certaine Musitians (though very exact in their Art) to depart, saying: "He heard a more pleasant harmony out of Livius. When you come then to this Musicall Feast; where you shall heare pleasing Aires mixed with doleful Lachrym ae's ; bring discretion along with you to rectifie your distempered appetites. Leave light notes to persons of light note. Stronger meates are prepared for your well-concocting Stomacks: such as may nourish you, and beget those manly abilities, that may fit and accommodate you for the knowing'st presence. It was the saying of a learned States-man in this Kingdome (whose Workes expresse him a serious reader of Men as well as Bookes ) that he would have a gentleman rather superficially seene in all Learnings, than exact in One. And his reason is, that one who reteines the Elements of all Knowledges, though they be but in a weak measure, yet hee can deliver himselfe by way of Discourse in what Subject soever shall be ministred: whereas Hee, who hath confin'd himselfe to an exact sight of one Knowledge, and no more, being out of that Element, wherein hee is solely exquisite, he must veile to other mens Discourse, and keepe consort with Silence. Now, to inable you for all Companies, no study may better accommodate, nay accomplish you, than the knowledge of History . So as Calisthenes said to Alexander , that he had rather carouse old Graines with Diogenes in his Dish, than new Grapes with Alexander in his Cup; "For of all the Gods (quoth he) I love not Æ sculapius : preferring conference with a Philosopher, before the society of a Scepter: and imbracing an abstemious course of moderation, before Festivall and Epicureall meetings. Even so should I in my choise of acquaintance, desire more to enjoy his company; who hath beene usefully vers'd on the Theatre of History;  533 than any other, whose affected dresse, or airy complement gives onely a sound to the Eare, but leaves no impression in the Conceipt. In our election then of Company (as I have many times observed) let it be our care ever to make choise of such, "of whom wee may bee  534 confident either to better them, or be bettered by them. And to chuse him for our Master (to use Seneca's counsell) whom wee may more admire when we see him, than when we heare him. For the habit of the mind is best discovered by  535 the Action, Station and Disposition of the body. So as, he deserves not the style of a Master, who seconds not that title in his outward gesture. Thus you have heard this Similitude explained, in this resemblanee of an History to a Feast : whereto if you come with tastes or appetites distempered; those various dishes, be they never so delicious, can afford you small delight: begetting rather in you a loathing than a longing So, in this incomparable Feast of History, where Dishes stored with all variety of discourse are served up, if you come with distempered judgements, not distinguishing what is wholesome from what is noysome, that which might have redounded to your infinite profit, by inversion of the right use, returnes to your detriment. Great preparation than is to be had in the solemnizing of so Princely a Banket. Secondly, hee compares it to a Field . Where we may preambulate and solace ourselves after more serious studies. Neither shall you finde more variety of flowers in the Field; than you may of excellent instructions, powerfull examples, with other perswasive Motives in our Histories. You shall finde Princes by taking their levell from these directions, entertaining  536 a facility of accesse, a benignity in Count'nance, an affability in discourse. Others, though their Education had highly enabled them, their assiduate  537 conference with learned Philosophers improved them: yet this their improvement extended but onely to knowledge: They were contemplatively  538 Proficients, but practically Deficients.  539 The Wolfe would not change his heart, though he had chang'd his haire. Againe, as in a Field , you shall encounter with many kindes of fruites, which, howsoever they appeare delightfull to the eye, are dis-relishing to the taste. So shall you in those spacious flourishing borders of History ; observe some Eminent Persons, whose faire Semblances promise nothing more than the practise of every Vertue: Their Countenance cheerefull, their Discourse delightfull, their Service to their Countrey seemingly faithfull; yet shall you finde them true Tiberians , glorying in nothing so much as cunningly and covertly cloathing their purposes with faire pretences, going invisible, and deluding their professed'st friends expectations with a seeming good. Others, like low-growing Plants, or earth-kissing Violets, though to the Eye of the World, they seeme contemptible; yet try them, and you shall finde them sweet and comfortable Consorts; though sleightly observed, deservingly approved, You shall find how those men, who, as Cosmo saith, carry their heart in their mouth, are more to bee pittied than feared. But contrarywise, those who carry their mouth in their heart, more to be feared than pittied. You shall heare Scipio described by Cicero to bee the most cunning Searcher of Mens Minds, and Sylla by Salust . Thus may you store your selves with flowers and fruits of all sorts in this Poly-carpian Field of History . And feele such fresh wholesome aire to cheere you, as no distemper (unlesse your owne dispositions feede it) can possibly surprize you. Thirdly, He compares some of our Historians to Builders ; interposing their owne particular judgements, and imping their owne conceipts, by which they many times divert the Scope of their History. Teaching the Generall of whom they write, what he should doe: neglecting in the meane time his owne Office, of recording what was done. And this errour falls many times upon a presuming Reader, as well as the originall Author. For many of our Criticks, who hold Minerva's Anvill to bee in their Braine, cannot read a Line without a Censure: and these for most part delight in nothing  540 more than catching and carping at an errour. This confirmes Salusts Position: "To reprehend others Actions and Speeches each mans mind is strongly affected. But if you meane to build wisely upon these Stories , you must leave behinde you all prejudicate conceipts. Read Actions as they were done; imitate whatsoever you finde commendably done: Eschew whatsoever you finde ignominiously done. Examples are usefull for you in both kindes: These to deterre; those to allure. Fourthly, he compares these glozing-sugred Historians to Cookes ; who (for the most part) use to preferre their Masters Palat before his profit. Such as these delude their Guests with guilded Plates, and indented Pastes. But guilded meates will never allay hunger. Profit and pleasure mixt together make the best musicke. The smell of Meat can no more feed the belly; than the sound of money fill the Purse. "There be some wholesome things indeed (saith that sinnowy  541 Seneca ) which without either touch or taste, profit much with their smell. But by these, the Morall meant no materiall Flowers: Those internall graces or beauties of the mind, which had received sweetnesse from Philosophicall instructions, were those sweete fragrant Odours he meant by. But to presse this Comparison a little farther: Our Historians should not be such Cookes , as onely to intend a pleasing of the Sense. There is more in History, than delighting a youthfull appetite. He then that desires to have his Workes live to posterity; or in after Ages to reteine his Memory; must disesteeme these pleasing humours of complying either with Time, or with any One; high in favour with Time. It was the Po ets resolution: As in my choyse of meates, so in my Booke, 542 I'd rather please my Guests, than please my Cooke. He Writes the best, who humours least. Nor can he expresse himselfe better, than in composing his Style to the state of that Subject whereof he Writes: Aiming more at publick profit, than any mans private respect or favour: for Partiality, of all others, layes the greatest aspersion upon an Historicall Labour. Fiftly, Hee compares the judgement of an Historian , when it becomes corrupted, to Wine ; (which of it selfe neat and generous) taketh either some waft or unfavoury taste from the Caske, or is corrupted by some other accident. Mixtures of Histories may bee not improperly resembled to our mixtures of Wines. They make them lose their flavour and vigour . Unlesse they be so discreetly mixed, that the strength of the History be not weakned; nor those principall passages whereof he takes occasion to treate, disordered or omitted. Wine muddy or troubled we cannot endure; it must be fined and cleared from the Lees. And so must History. Purged and refined it should be from all Lees; or incredible Lies. From all impertinences, uselesse digressions, artlesse independencies. Otherwise it will taste flat ; and beget a distaste to any discerning judgement. Lastly, He compares unadvised Readers of History to Countrey Clownes , who in the spoyle of a City, breake into some Apothecaries shoppe, well furnished with all receipts: but not distinguishing what is Soveraigne from what is Poyson; offering to their Sense for for good whatsoever seemes pleasing: They fall into Phrensies, Plurisies, and all Distempers. Observe this Gentlemen , and make use of it. The Deare , if hee be wounded, can flye to Ditany , to cure him;  543 The Beare when he feeles himselfe sicke, seekes for Emmets , aud eates them, and these recover him. The Bee , if he be distemper'd, hyes him to Balme mint , and that cheeres him. Is it so, that these irrationall Creatures know how to cure their griefes; and will you neglect what may cheere your minds? You may finde in History , as in a Confectionary , soveraigne Receipts, choice Electuaries to cure all maladies. Whatsoever is defective in you, may be heere supplyed; and whatsoever is in some small measure perfected, may be more fully accomplished. Nothing, whether it conduce to Discourse or Action, Warre or Peace, Arts or Armes, but may by Historicall Helpes bee highly advanced. The Philosophers Axiome is: Omne quod non ens est, malumest . And worse then no being (have they) who measure out their lives without a due proportion drawne from others, and applied to  544 themselves. Instruction is the light of Being, the directresse of Living, and the best Schoole-mistresse that disciplines us dying: States publicke are managed by her, Offices private administred by her, and the wisest men have desired to possesse her. No Beauty more permanent, Jemme more eminent, or Treasure more Excellent; it beautifies it selfe; and no Phidias could ever portray any picture so well as it portrayes it selfe. And what instruction better then that which comes from History, where the true Image of our life is delineated, Vertue in her best colours expressed, and Vice (without either shadow or pretence) layd open and naked? The Prodigall reads, and sees himselfe represented in another Person; he  545 sees the miserable end of others, which (unlesse he will fall with open eyes) must needs caution himselfe: he sees haire-brain'd courses, leave both Patrimony and reputation behind them: Penelopees Woers, ever woing, never winning. The miserable wretch, that pincheth himselfe to enrich his unthankfull Posterity, may see the fruit of gathering Perdition to himselfe, and oft-times occasion of ruine and speedy desolation to his surfeiting Heire. Here the brave Souldier sees his owne fame; Acts duly and fully expressed: not a famous Exploit (deserving memory) must be silenced, but the very name of the Agent, (to excite others the more) must be Recorded. Here the effeminate Milke-sop, that sights best under his Ladies flagge, first man that will come to a lascivious Banket, but last that will come to a pitched field: Hee (I say) must shew himselfe, though  546 finally to his credit: yea, Alcybiades (though otherwise well deserving of his Country) must be set out in his ignominious death; aswell as his memorable life; giving up the Ghost in the lappe of his Concubine Tymandra. He defined History to life, though confined to a short line, who call'd it: "A Theatre of noble Actions, begetting in the Spectators a laudable Envy, a glorious Emulation. Nor shall we find in the whole passage of our  547 life, so true a Herald for deblazoning Vertue or Vice, as it is. We say, Letters cannot blush : and though many unbeseeming Act be by her presented, with the quality of the Person by whom it was acted: yet like a faithfull undaunted Record, it recommends with a composed and censorious countenance, how it was done and by whom, without glozing with Person or Time. Such Registers cannot perish: whereas others, who are wonne by Greatnesse, or corrupted with base Lucre, (of all others the basest) or out of private discontent (an Errour too commonly taking amongst many Historians) asperse dishonour on any Person or State (of all others the hatefullest) cannot promise any perpetuity, because they faile in their foundation, being not grounded on Principles of Verity. Oh what a gracefull beauty bestowes our Historian on Vertue, when expressed in any Eminent Person! How it wooes Followers, and wins them to be Imitators of such goodnesse! The Members cannot be distemper'd, when the Head is healthfull. When the Prince turnes Philosopher, the whole Court becomes an Academy. History then, as it may be properly stiled, The Noble-mans Lecture : So their Actions, Lectures to the inferiour. Nothing commendable in the great, which brings not with it an Additament, being cloathed with greatnesse. For great Persons, be their lifes remarkable eyther for some eminent Vertues, or egregious Vices, they become presidents to their shadowes. Three especiall commendable qualities have  548 bin thought ever fitting Consorts to accompany Persons of quality; but these have bin ever observed most estranged from their society. 1. Patience in suffering Adversity: 2. Moderation in bearing Prosperity: 3. Humility in attempring Soveraignty. That wise Chylo , when his brother took it distastfully, that he himselfe should not be made Ephorus , when Chylo was; made him this answere to allay his Choller: "Content your selfe Brother, I know how to suffer injuries, so do not you. Implying, that none was fit for place of Authority, but could patiently endure affronts, or suffer an injury. This it was which so truly recorded Camillus name in the Annals of Honour: whom neither his Dictatorship could too much raise, nor his exile from his Country, too much deject. This, those praise-worthy Romanes bravely shewed in their constant and unamated resolution after their disaster at Cann ae (as hath beene observed) where at such time as hearing of nothing but utter ruine and desolation ringing in every place, they did nothing unworthy themselves: deserving no lesse honour in bearing their losse, then their enemies in obtaining the prize. But for one president of patient-suffering in this kind; we shall meet with many opposite examples, inclining to a contrary bent. Yea such, who had bin sufficiently schooled in Philosophy, and had read what weake trust was to be reposed in prosperity. Amongst these, you shall find some overcome with grief[illeg.] upon innovation of government, to lay violent hands upon themselves. Poniards and poysons their familiar receipts to cure all discontents. These could not endure to see the face of a State altered, their Consull-authority dis-valued; their antient Lawes dis-annulled; but they must witnesse their griefe with a fatall stabbe; though such a desperate act conferre no benefit to the State. No lesse rare have our Historians held Moderation in bearing Prosperity , with persons of Command and Soveraignty. Alexander in the height of his successe, was so farre transported with the suppositious title of a Deity, as he began to forget Mortality: yet one wound received can make him retract that Errour; and confesse himselfe a mortal man, though the worlds Commander. What would he have sayd, if he had seene himselfe remaine thirty dayes without buriall; but Diogenes (poore contemptible  549 Diogenes ) solemnized with a glorious Buriall. How farre Pyrrhus , the victorious C aesar , experienst Hannibal , imperious, but afterwards calamitous Antiochus , Majestick Mithridates , Martiall Miltiades fell short of this Moderation , their owne actions (deblazoned to life by our Historicall Heralds) will sufficiently demonstrate. These wanted Simonides to sing unto them, as he did sometimes to Pausanias ; or as that Page every morning did to Philip of Macedon: "Philip remember that thou art a Man . Or the  550 Spartans speech to the Samnites : "We have forgot our beginning, we have not understood our ending, because we have not remembred our beginning. Whereas in others we shall finde an absolute Moderation in the height of their Prosperity ; and such a Princely commaund of themselves, as their very minds declared them worthy of nothing lesse then Soveraignty. This appeared in the Moderation of noble Affrican , mild Marcellus , strict Severus ; who with an easie contempt slighted the honour they enjoyed, and could Philosophically digest the losse of fortunes, if they perished: whence we cloze, Honour can be no attractive Lure, to the composed spirit of a true Her oick Lover. Lastly, with what a Princely beauty Divine Humility shewes herselfe in the bosome of Nobility, may appeare in that modest reply of that victorious Godfrey , to such, as after his glorious Conquest of Hi erusalem , to the honour of Christendome, offer'd to set a Crowne of gold upon his head, but he refused it, saying, "God forbid that the Servants head should be with Gold crowned , where his Masters head was with Thornes pierced. Now, the rarity of this Vertue (or rather the repository of all vertues) is recommended to us by Venerable Bede in this memorable story: " Aidan a religious Bishoppe, weeping for King Osuinus , and demaunded by the Kings Chaplaine why he wept? I know, sayd he, that the King shall not live long: for never before this time have I seene an humble King. Which hapned accordingly, for he was cruelly murdred by Oswin . Howsoever, if in any of these, such Personages as the Historian makes mention of, fal short, through corruption of discipline, he should not be sparing in his modest discovery, so it import the subject of his History: where it is expected all things should be delivered impartially. Absolute Histories will not admit of the least concealement; but representing every Act, Person, and Event, use to illustrate what is worth insisting upon, omitting (or at least cursorily passing over) more fruitlesse Subjects: and how delightfull may it seeme to every judicious man, when in reading of ancient Records, he conferres the Stratagems of Warre then used, with the present observance of this Time: sees (and seeing) notes the sundry dispositions of men, how noble in themselves, and how generally esteemed invincible, by a sudden conversion laid low, beneath the stirrop of Fortune, and made a spectacle of Fate! Then to observe States, better governed in their decline than in their height; and farre more able in power, when in the eye of the World least powerfull. The Romans , when they had attained the very height of Felicity, that all Governments were their Tributaries, then they began to stoop most under their burden; and pressed with their owne grandeure, seemed to imitate the Ph aenix , who weary of her selfe, desired to have her ashes renewed, but her selfe extinguished. What ambitious Tyrants proud of their 551 owne strength, and secure of Divine power, are layd flat in the height of their expectancies: so as where they planted the foundation of their hopes, there they were most defeated; to expresse the providence, & all-working Majesty of God, who disposeth of all governments, pulling down  552 the tyrannicall Empires, and setting wise and discreet Princes in their place! And no motive (of prophane writings) more effectuall then Histories, to draw us to a consideration of our selves, and the Majesty of God, whose excellency beautifies this Universe, teaching us to admire, and (in our admiration) to tremble and feare, having recourse to the incomprehensible judgments, and secret counsels of the Almighty. Every private Family may draine hence unspeakable profit , observing the divers casualties,  & mutabilities subject to every one  553 that is interessed especially in matters of state; preferring their own private and free Life, before popular admiration, so intangled with continuall incertainties. Here may the poore Husbandman, at his leasure, receive tidings from Forraigne Courts: here he may learne what difference there is betwixt the Coulter and the Scepter, the Share and the Shield. Here may the Marchants  554 wife pitty her poore husband, tossed with so many adverse winds, invironed with so sundry dangers, and exposed to so miserable adventures; she cannot chuse but play true at home, that hath a husband so faithfull abroad, who endangers himselfe to make her secure: why should any come into his hazard, that like a Tenis-ball casts himselfe into every hazard? Here the wife of the valiant Souldier may see what difficulties her distressed husband is exposed unto, heat, cold, watching, hunger, thirst, all inconveniences, to propagate the glory of his Country,  & purchase himselfe a name eternally memorable. His poor family hath reason to powre out their prayers for his deliverance, and thankfully ascribe all glory to the power of Heaven for his safe returne. To be briefe, what particular estate not engaged to Relations 555 of this nature? The Mariner seeth his dangers; and seeing them, observeth the influence of the Stars, and Planets, the Orion and the Pleiades ; yet in all these observances, he gathers there is a Power above, whom the Sea and winds obey: to him therefore, as (the expertest Pilote) he flies for succour, finding no harbor more serure, no repose  556 more safe. The Souldier sees into the Discipline of Armes;  & (by History) apprehends how a smal handfull of Men have oft-times conquered an Army, to the judgment of Man invincible: he sees into it, and admires the wonderfull power of God, who worketh oft-times directly against all meanes, to teach us thus much: that his power is not limited to meanes; but can effect (without the least instruments) what in his sacred Synode he hath ordained. Here the Marchant sees into the riches of the whole Earth, how it pleaseth God to subject all things to the service of Man, to the end Man might only resolve himselfe for the service of God : he observes the exceeding favours of Heaven shewne upon Earth, and he collects hence, that those joyes,: whose comforts and exceeding treasures which he keepeth for the Elect in Heaven, must needs be great above all comparison. Si tanta solatia in die lachrymarum, 557 quanta conferet in die nuptiarum ? These considerations must of necessity move him to play the good Marchant, who finding one Jem of price, will sell all and buy it. Yet see the misery of Man! That he who hath received all things from that insdicate Fountaine  558 of Divine Bounty, should preferre the fruits of Misery, before the promises of Gods Mercy! Those erring Philosophers, when they conceived those sweet-relishing comforts they enjoyed by the Ministry of the foure Elements, they could not (poore deluded Soules!) ascribe lesse than the Title of a Deity to every distinct Element.  559 Zeno makes Fire; Zenophanes Earth; Anaximenes Ayre; Hippeas Water , to be their Gods. Yet, when all these Elements joyne in one voyce and vote, crying, "Wee are not your Gods, seeke him above us: Hee is your God, Hee is our God who made both you and us ; We become lesse thankfull to our true God, than they to their false Gods, A Motive, then, to Thankfulnesse, might be worthily hence derived from a Commemoratioon of Mans irreparable Misery, without Gods ineffable mercy. Glorious is the Image hee h'as imprinted in him; various, and beauteous be those graces hee h'as bestowed on him; a more precious prize is reserved for him: and are not all these of power to wooe and winne him? Againe, should he reflect upon himselfe, and consider how by sinfull declining, he is dayly descending to a miserable condition, from which, without Gods great mercy there is no redemption: he would turne, no doubt all Niobe : and with pious teares, holy vowes, religious purposes, vertuous actions, labour his freedome from captivity, to re-possesse him of his primitave liberty. Histories are plenteous in examples, relating the miseries of Eminent States; and how soone those, who to the eye of the World, appeared most happy; closed so cheerefull a Day with an Evening Summons of irreparable misery. And the greatest ground of their unhappinesse, tooke life generally from their owne selfe-confidence. It was the Saying of that Noble Themistocles: "I had perished, had I not perished . And it is the generall condition of all Man-kinde: Men are never farther from happinesse, than when they seeme to be in most happinesse. For what is this Theatre of Tragick encounters, Where we act this calamitous Sceane of our life, but ever hung about with mourning? Trc iln[illeg.] , was held more happy than Primus , because hee dyed younger, and therefore his teares, fewer than Priamus. Mithridates had beene more happy, if he had dyed sooner before he saw his misery. Darius , while victorious, might have dyed gloriously; a few longer dayes eclyps'd his glory. Hee, who sometimes thirsted after Soveraignty, and failed in that which he most sought, when in his flight he drunke muddy and stinking water, said; "That he never drunke a sweeter draught. Contraries by opposition receive best illustration. Let us eye the condition of those States which many yeares have preceeded us, and collect our owne happinesse by their disquiets. Sweet is Warre to them that have not tryde it. But such as rightly weigh it, with the inconveniences that accompany: it, will render all thanks to that Prince of Peace , by whose blessing they enjoy it. These, by dayly experience can distinguish of the Utilities betwixt Peace and Warre . They observe, how in Peace , Sonnes burie their Fathers: but in Warre , Fathers burie their Sonnes: how in Peace , the sick are healed: but in Warre , the whole are wounded. Where it is doubtfull, whether the Agent or Patient be more miserable. It is an excellent Rule, which is commended to us, in the  560 use of Warre : "Neither to provoke taking up of Armes, nor to lay them downe upon just occasion offered. But how happy we; when in this our Inclosed Garden , our owne Olive may feed us, our owne Vine cheere us, our owne Figge-tree shadow us! This, other Neighbour-States are farre from injoying; yea, such, as so nearely bound us, that, Exrgu a prohibentur aqua \--- A smal cut divides us; but agreat difference of condition betwixt us. This, in the remembrance of others unhappines, shold induce us to thank fulnes. God hath in store Judgement as well as Mercy; of the first Cuppe others, and those our Neighbours, have deepely tasted; of the latter, our Cuppes have beene plenteously sweetned. God hath powred downe the Viols of his Wrath upon other Nations, in sending out those three fearefull Messengers, and in shooting those three fatall Arrowes; Famine, Sword and Pestilence; We onely who deserve least, have shared in the last, and have for a season mourned, yet are not wee converted: our griefe being for most part rather for decrease of our Trade, or Traffick, or the decay of our Worldly estate in some measure, than hearty sorrow for incurring Gods displeasure. The onely usefull way for us in this Review of Gods Mercies to us, and his Judgements upon others, is to retreeve our thoughts from earth;  561 to fixe our affections where we have stored our divinest Treasures. And as Heaven h'as shut her windowes of Judgements to us, and hath opened them upon others: And h'as opened the windowes of his Mercy to us, which hee ha's shut from others: let it be our especiall care to ramme up our windowes, I meane our outward Senses , that Death enter not in by them; and Tarpeia -like, betray our chiefest Cittadell unto  562 them. The Poet in the person of some Vertuous Ones, expressed neatly the Soveraigne effect of this receipt in these Words: Within their Lodges they their eyes restrained, That Lures of light love might be still refrained, Whence the rich prizes of pure minds they gained With peace adorned. Thus if our affections were erected, our actions directed, and our waies corrected, we should soone (to use Senecas words) "Gather our Vessels in the Haven safely, and after a long perillous voyage, arrive with Glory. Every private houshold is a little Kingdome within it selfe, aud needes instructions (though not so consequently serious) as the greatest Palace, and royallest Empire: order must be observed in the one, as well as in the other; a Principality in both, and a subjection to both. VVhat fitter for the housholder to traine his children, servants, and attendants in (next Diuine VVrit) than the reading of profitable Stories, such as excite to Vertue, and stirre up their mindes to the undertaking of something worthy a resolved spirit? I know the base minded Groome hearing the prosperous successe of Lucius Quintius ,  563 who was chosen one of the Patricij from his Plow stilt, and afterwards by his valour and magnanimity, reserveth the name to this day, of Triumphalis Agricola : a poore Husband-man sitting in his Chaire of Triumph, will desire by all meanes to imitate so notable a president; scorning to rippe up the bosome of the earth, when he may purchase himselfe more fame by the deblazing his honour upon earth. The homespunne Shepheard, hearing the renowned Acts of Romulus , fed and brought up among Shepheards: and of Cirus , who bare himselfe a Prince among Shepheards, will cast away Scrippe and Sheepe-crooke, and behave himselfe a worthy successour in their profession. The Gardiner hath an Emperour of his profession, to imitate, and an honest one too, as his name implyes, to wit, Probus . The Wood-man or Forrester, a Pompilius . The Diviner, a Zoroastres : and the Philosopher, an Antonius . But many have we, that we may better imitate than Princes: as their state was eminent, so were their  564 natures depraved. We shall read that many of them were as good Law-breakers, as Law-makers; and the greatest Vices appeared least, (though most approved) in greatest men. They had ever vertuous pretences to shadow vice: sin became cloathed in Tissue. We shall see impunity of offences to be a great supportresse of them, presuming still on the Kings mercy, and squaring their course to his Discipline: for Subjects love to imitate their Prince, either in Vice or Vertue: but more are there inclined to the worst than the best; making this conclusion, through long and inveterate custome of sinne; which Med aea in that cunning and quaint Discourse seemed to compasse, with this subtile preparation, laying this grand-hold of proceeding: Fructus est scelerum, nullum tibi scelus putare : A position of Machiavel : VVherein every judicious Reader may gather the admirable  565 and inscrutable wisedome of God, frustrating their devices, annihilating their purposes, never bringing their designes to effect: yea, which is more worthy our observation, making there the most fooles, where they thought themselves to be most wise. For their policies either in governing, or establishing Empires; How farre short have their purposes ever come to effect: Examples I could produce many of this nature, as well Divine as Morall. It is a safe, because a Divine Conclusion; No Estate secure without the protection of a Supreme  566 Power. Take a Survey of all conditions, and you shall finde Frailty the Foundation they stand on. Cares and Feares, Shadows they cannot fly from. No Guard so strong, as to secure from Feare a Princes state: yea, he shall finde his very Kingdome to be his Prison while he is in it,  567 and to be anothers when he is removed from it. Yea, he shall finde nothing to be more profitable for a King, than sometimes not to play the King. Yea, were there no Enemies to invade him; No disloyall hearts to undermine him, yet would he encounter with jealous and suspicious feares within himselfe to surprise him. This Potion wrought strongly with Dionysius , that Tyrant of Syracuse , who (as upon the like occasion hath beene formerly observed) became so suspicious, as hee would not trust his Barber to shave him, causing his Daughters to supply the Office of Barbers. Poore Majesty! What pleasure could this Tyrant take in having a Kingdome; when his Crowne could not sit more close to his head, than those individuall Cares to a Crowne clung neare to his heart? This caused Seleuchus so accustomably to say, "That if a Man knew with what Cares a Diadem was clogged; how very few houres he were from disquiets freed; hee would not take it up, though it lay in the street. Yea, should neither Enmity assaile him, nor infirmity invade him, nor cares seaze on him, nor feares surprize him; yet would he find within him, though he had no assailants without him, that would daily amate him, nightly awake him. And now, when he h'as summ'd up all his caref; and summon'd all his feares; he finds all his seeming glory, that mighty masse of Majesty, confined to a very straite period. Though Zerxes march along with a populous Army, drinking dry whole Rivers as they goe. Though Alexander intend to reduce Mount Athos to the proportion of a Man; a small Molehill in comparison of a Mountaine will serve to cover him. It is not in the power of a Monarchy to plead her prerogative against Mortality. Let Æ gistus shrowd himselfe with shame under Clitemnistra's shelter; Let Achylles expose himselfe with glory to all danger; an inevitable fate attends on both: Though Fame solemnize the Funerall of the one; but Infamy the obits of the other. Continent Cornelia aswell as Sensuall Scriboni ; vertuous Lelia aswell as vicious Semphronia ; modest Flavia aswell as wanton Faustina ; constant Octavia aswell as incontinent Messalina must share stakes equally with Fate: only they differ in the estimate of Fame: In aequales nascimur, aequales morimur . Unequall in Birth, equall in Death. An equality of condition exacts an equall necessity of our dissolution. Neither be the Low wholy more secure then the High; which is no lesse sententiously than truely verifide: Winds upon Cedars with most fury blow, Whose fall must ruine those that grow below. O how dearely have many of our shady Followers of Greatnesse bought this Experiment! when their dependence upon such as were addicted to Ambition, brought them along with their unhappy Masters, to a speedy ruine. No Estate then can be secured: so long as we are Pilgrims, we must be inclosed with perils. For as Simple men are catched by others, so are Polititians catcht commonly by themselves. For tell me, thou Leprous Timist, who infectest the Aire by which thou breathest, makest the Earth barraine whereon thou treadest, makest every creature thy enemy which thou enjoyest; what will it availe thee to be a profest Neuter , to make Religion a politick end, to be ever resolving, and never resolved; ever doubtfull, and never setled; to be a Toppe which alwayes runnes round; or a Wheele ever holding a circular Motion without progression? To have thy Religion ebbing and flowing; thy Profession  568 like the Soule of Hermotimus in Plutarch , and of Epemenides in Hesychius , comming and going: little caring whether Religion sinke or swimme, whether thy Profession stand or fall; or like to Metius Suffetius in Livie , who would strike or speake for neither side, untill one side goe downe, and then joyne to that which is best for Commodity? What will this availe thee, thou temporizing changeling! Thou canst not shrowde thy selfe, nor actions from his eyes, who seeth all things, alwayes, at once. He, who h'as not God pleased, shal never escape his fury unappeased. There was never since the beginning of the world so cautious a Delinquent, that could find an Appeale from Gods judgment. Let the Usurous wretch scrape never so carefully; contract never so cautelously; hoord up never so plentuously; and gull the world never so subtilely: all this will not secure him; he h'as Serjeants within him to attach him; besides his prodigall child, whose forlome hopes daily and nightly startle him. Gnipho the Usurer (as Lucian faigneth) lyeth in Hel lamenting his miserable estate, that one Rodochares an incestuous prodigall did on earth consume his goods wastfully, which he with care and unjust meanes had scrap'd and rack'd together. This Fiction begets a representive action: we shall find few scraping Gnipho's , but they ever leave behind them their scattring Rodochares . Be it every mans care so to regulate his providence: that his fortunes may appeare to be the Revenues of a good Conscience: and his Seed succeed in the possession of their inheritance. In the enjoyment of which happinesse, let none of us labour of such an Atrophie , as to want an healthful and thankfull digestion of Gods gracious benefits. The Highest Prince then, be he never so strongly guarded; nor with forraigne Allyes powerfully friended; nor with Treasures, warres sinnews, enriched; nor with Ammunition furnished; cannot promise himselfe to be secure, without the protection and assistance of a Supreame power. How safe thought Cirus himselfe established in his new Translated Monarchy? when behold his security ends as miserably, as his beginnings had a flourish of seeming happinesse: Unfortunate he was for to be deprived of his hoped for Greatnesse, by a Sexe so weakly effeminate: Soucing that Head (which was Head to a powerfull government) in a Tunnell of blood, with this bitter invection: Satia te sanguine 569 quem diu sitijsti, cujusque insatiabilis semper  fuisti. The like of his successor Cambyses , who hoping to plant himselfe in a royall Throne by blood, miserably ended his owne life by his owne blood. An excellent and notable example of a sacrilegious and blood-thirsty Prince, who sought to establish himselfe by indirect  570 meanes, (to wit) by the murther of his owne Naturall Brother Mergis . I insist longer upon examples, because I have oft-times found that Sentence of Demosthenes to bee most true: ![](/images/inline/Pgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sb.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rb.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif)  . 571 These examples being best motives unto Piety, and, indeed, more forcible, in that we have two occasions in exemplary Presidents of imitation; the one to caution us not to doe this or that, least we fall into the like punishment, being attended on by the like meanes: The other (like a sweet lenitive) inducing us by reasons drawne from profit, which wee conceive may redound a-any way by the like examples; which the Po et seemes to illustrate when he saith: Exemplo alterius qui sapit, ille sapit. The greatest benefit in private, I imagine to be drawne likewise, from the right and exact use of History: which particular good I have ranked in the second place, and that is this: In private to behold the sundry dispositions of Princes and People : Reasons where of cannot be given, but onely from the temperature of the Region wherein they live: Which reasons drawne from conjecturall grounds, are oftentimes deceived in themselves; as in disposing or ordering of States to the square of wisedome. This benefit I have gathered, and placed in the Rereward: Last Observances (I know) take greatest Impression, and none more needfull than this: when wee shall have commerce with any people, than to call to mind their disposition, lest wee incurre a greater mischiefe through our ignorance. Strangely jealous are some Nations, they have Ac aeons Eyes, perchance his Eares: Wee must shew our selves modestly bashfull toward such; every lascivious looke is as good as a Comment for such men, taking our Eye to be the Directresse of our Heart: Others more prodigall of their Wives reputation, seeme respectlesse of their shame, or the hostage of honour, so they may increase their Estate, and raise their Fortunes out of Honours ruines. Other people we know to be of a surly, proud, and intractable nature, living more by their owne will (making it their Law) than the square of Reason. Others seemingly humble, more dangerous farre than the other; under pretences religiously honest, masking treacherous and disloyall projects: Never lesse your Friend, than when seeming 572 most so: He hath a fleering looke, smooth face, slecke tongue; can observe times, and for private advantage (like a second Sinon ) unbosome himselfe unto you: There be no windows in his heart, therefore beleeve him not; if by the transparancy of thy eye thou couldst see into that rotten Sepulchre of his sugred-poisoned heart, thou wouldst admire so faire and beautifull an out- side, to have so loathsome and hideous an in-side: Better charactred thou canst not have him than by History, it is the best Image of thy Life, and can best set out in their owne native colours such deformed Images. 573 Nor is there any Modell drawne so neare to life, as History is to the Image of Mans life. There is no affection so strongly predominant in any person now living; which he may not find represented in lively colours, in the lifes and actions of others. And no doubt, but this affinity or resemblance of manners begot in Pithagoras that opinion of his Metempsychosis or transmigration of Soules: for so nearely found he the disposition of One resembling an Other; as he verily thought the Soule of that person endewed with such affections, passed into an others body: for otherwise they could not possibly so nearely agree in the temper or quality of their humours. And should man take a due pervsall of himselfe; what he is naturally most affected too; what passion most rageth or raigneth in him; what hopes and feares accompany him; upon what grounds those receive life in him. Againe; what receipts he finds most Soveraigne to attemper those Motions in him: no doubt, but he shall upon reading of History , meete with some One or Other, so nearely resembling him, and inwardly like him; as he cannot chuse but hugge the Story for the Statue sake. Seeing himselfe so nearely moulded, as himselfe cannot be more like himselfe, then he finds his mentall part resembled. So as, he might well avouch, upon the presentment of an other so like himselfe: Vel meipsum nescio, vel in alio meipsum Sentio : I eyther know not my selfe, or in another I see my selfe. Might we assume that freedome which Plutarch enjoyed, in a Paralell of preceeding with succeeding times; the persons and actions present with those that went before us; we should returne as neare a resemblance in ours, as ever he did in the Symbolizing of his Princes. Themistocles found Miltiades spirit in himselfe. Such like noble minded Persons should we finde in ours. Others, like Palinurus , or a love-sicke Paris , more apt to encounter with love, then to ingage themselves in any other List. And neare resemblances might we cull out aswell for these as those: both for Campe Honour and a Carpet Lover. Which might prove a singular motive to excite Valour, even in those, whose remisser spirits stood before so rebaited, as they might take a perfect draught of their owne Physnomies by that white-liver'd Captaine, who looking himselfe in a Glasse when he was angry, was affrighted with his owne countenance. Whereas, contrariwise, true Heroick Spirits, who never tooke acquaintance of one unmanly feare, might find others so lively resembling them, as if they lineally descended from them. Such a Survey of Honour might rightly merit the Title of the Noble-mans Lecture : Laying downe such deserving grounds of Courtiers integrity, Martiall prowesse and Christian pollicy, as might attract unto them an eagre desire of imitation. Nor in this Nursery Of Gentry should the quick-sighted Reader find only discourse for Noble Personages to regulate themselves by; in the view of others actions and dispositions, with the resemblance they find in themselves both of their actions and dispositions: But even such, who have bestowed much precious time in a Sedentary life , shall obserue others no lesse affected that way, then themselves. That neare resemblance, no doubt, which Divine Plato gath'red from the report of Phocions disposition, and his, (confirmed by intermissive Letters and other motives) drew him forth of Asia into Cilicia , for no other cause but onely to see Phocion , so much endeared to him by the report of his vertues, and neare resemblance in conversation. In this respect, our History may well deserve the Style of the Muses Wardroabe . Or by reason of the Continuation of her Mixt. Discourse , stored, for the Readers more delight, with all variety, be properly entitled, The Schollers Medley . But our care is not to insist on Style , but profit of the State : making this our principall ayme, that as in favour and feature you resemble others, you may by a Divine emulation, retaine likewise a resemblance of the vertues of others. Nor is it to be questioned, but as wee see faces in their favour so nearely resembling one another (though they have no relation to one an other in blood) as they can hardly be discerned one from the other: So likewise, in the inward favour or feature of the Mind, there is such an harmony or Divine Symmetry, as there can be no nearer resemblance to the Eye, in those parts or lineaments of the body. How much then, Gentlemen , may History seeme to deserve your Love; when you may see in it as in a Mirror, the Image of your whole Life? This is no such deceiving artificial Glasse, that by the remotenesse of your Object, makes little things seem great, and great little: for this renders a true proportion to the face of every action. 574 Besides this, History directs Man in the progresse of this Life. It never deblazons Honour in the field, but as a branch derived from the first house. Whatsoever declines or degenerates from her, must beare no Armes without a distinction; when Goodnesse suffers a deficience, it must carry no Coat without a difference. And such Corrasives bring many times vicious habits both to a feeling and a cure. No matter, though ill-affected mindes accompt such Monitors at the first for their Foes, they will hold them, when they have try'd them, for their truest friends. Telephus , when hee could finde none amongst his Friends to cure his wound, permitted his Enemy to doe it. And hee, who purposed to kill Prometheus the Thessalian , opened his Impostume with his Sword. Corrasives are ever held more Soveraigne than Cordials for old Sores. Nay, in these Treasuries of Time , you shall finde Directions from one State or Story to another, to prepare man both for his present and future condition. 575 Starres are directing Emblemes unto Kings, Kings to their Peeres, Peeres to inferiour things. Nor stayeth our Historicall Direction heere:  576 for it prepares Man as well in his passage from life, as Pilgrimage of this life: shewing, what diversity of infirmities accompany us; how they are the Suburbs of Death: and how every yeere, nay, every Moonth bringeth some one or new malady, as a Messenger of Mans mortality. 577 He will tell you too, how bitter Death is unto such, who never thinke of it before they grapple with it: and this our Historian points out to life  578 in that sole-affectionate or Soule-passionate Dialogue of that expiring Emperour, in his pittifully-perplexed farewell to his best-beloved, his dearest Darling. Thus may you finde in History , the Image and Life of Man, his Image after he surceaseth to be Man. Directions for his Life; Provisions against Death: effectuall Considerations for both. Upon a review of the Premisses, we may safely draw up this Conclusion: Thy whole Life wrapt  579 up in Experiments either at home or abroad, cannot teach thee so much, as a serious discourse taking breath from one integrious History, will teach thee in one yeere. Scriptis aspiret meis, qui favet votis. Laus ei soli tribuatur omnis, Cujus afflatu Labor extat omnis, Fructus ut vitae referantur omnes Orbis in oras.
