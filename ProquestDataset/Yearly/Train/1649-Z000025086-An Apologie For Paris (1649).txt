 you, to which they are so addicted by a naturall propensitie, as they are never more in their owne Sphere , then when they be moving upon your Ladiships Errand. Nor is this without good reason, since that rare cumble of Graces and Vertues , that Venus and Minerva have treasured up in the fair Tablet of your face, and rich Closet of your mind, have made such a perfect conquest of me, that my will is but the Eccho of yours, or rather I have no will but your pleasure ; the palpitation of my heart, and pulse of my affections, so observe, and keep such even time and measure with yours, as they are no longer mine, but your owne. And ( Curious wonder of Natures sweat ) proud am I that you will make use of your owne, in giving a Theame to my Muse , who nor knowes, nor delights in any other, than the praises , or (cause thats too high a flight for her flaggie pinion) the admiration of your Ladiship . But such as she is, she glories to be yours, and in that Liverie comes to prostrate at your feet a Jargon of a few rambling passages, thought upon only in obedience to your Commands. For may it please your Ladiship to remember, that among other passages of entertainment, at Sir Johns , there happened a conference concerning the omnipotency of Love , and triumph of Beauty , in pursuance of which the Trojan Prince Paris his Judgement was called in question, and he blamed for disposing of the Ball (as he did) to Loves Mistris , when two other great Deities were her competitors; Your well-worded Brother (compared with whom I am lesse than a shadow) pleaded stifly for Juno , Sir T. B. Bar  t t for Pallas , and there being none that had taken up the Bucklar for Venus , your Ladiship commanded me to become her Advocate ; so that there was rather a necessitie of, than an Arrogance in, my undertaking it. Now ( Excellent Lady ) so auspicious were my Stars to me (above merit) that these course-waled Passages found good acceptance from that noble Company, but especially (which I was most ambitious of) from your Deare selfe, who bad me file them upon the Register of time, lest they should evaporate into aire, and be lost, and enjoined me to give you an exact Copy of them, promising to over-value them so far, as to let them find roome in your Cabinet. See here then ( Fair Queen of Hearts ) these few Flowers by me stuck upon Venus her tresses, expanding themselves (like the Marigold to Ph aebus ) to the Sunnie beames of your eyes , in whom it lies either to cherish , or scorch them. Nor Madam durst I own the thought, that you would once open those starry Casements of your Soule , to glance upon these creeping Ideas , but that I may call them (in a manner) your owne, for it was your breath that gave them birth , though they were conceived by, Madam , Your Ladiships Most enchained Servitor, From Grayes Inne . Robert Baron. An Epigram. Madam, Reading the Legend of the Trojan Warre. Then did you wish t'have seen that peerlesse Dame , Whose forme (rarer than wonder) partiall fame Proclameth with so loud a blast, as it Fires coldest hearts, and deafest cares doth hit. You mus'd of what fine clay Titan did make Her, better than the rest, that for her sake Th' hot Phrygian Prince thought it not much to come To scarse known Greece , from remote Ilium ; And that Greece thought not millions lives too deare, With all her Mines to boot, to ransome her; And that the Teuerans did not stick to fill Their Trenches with their blouds to guard her still. If her Effigies , or a better face, Madam , you long to see, look in your Glasse . Your Ladiships to the Altar, From th'other two the Prize away to beare Of Beauty , as thou dost the prize of wit From all, that ever on this subject writ. Thou'st made great Juno boast, with such a grace Her Acts, and plead in such a wealthy Phrase For th' Golden Ball , as she doth owe to thee Much of that metall for a Salarie. Thou'st made wise Pallas speak such very charmes, Urging the Glory of her Arts , and Armes , As she, in recompence, must slift a bough From Daphne's trunk, and therwith Grace thy brow . And 'cause thou'st helpt Loves Goddesse to declare The pleasures of her Nymph , so sweet, so fair, (For whose sake she obtain'd the Prize ) may She One such ( fair as her self) bestow on thee . D: S. Gent. Robert Baron Born to be rare. Thy Letters , as so many Starres , doe tell, Thou shalt be rare , without a Paralell. Sic vaticinatur , Robert Freeman , For rejecting of Iuno and Pallas , and presenting of Ate's Golden Ball to Venus : With a discussion of the Reasons that might induce him to favour either of the three. with the dainties of Ida's Painted Meades, whose Princely Shepheard Paris (for even such in time of yore disdained not the Sheephook, and to converse with old russet honesty) sat sheltring himself from the fiery lashes of heavens curle-pate waggoner, under the courteous shade of a broad beech, warbling upon his seaven-fold Syrinx some amorous sonnet, that spoke high the encomiums of some neighbouring shepheardesse, having the pretty Songsters of the woods bearing part in his Lyribliring melodie, whilst the conspiring armes of the trees danced to the Concord, and the complisant Nymph, Eccho , in the vaulted bowre approved, and imitated each of his aires, as greedily as if her deare Narcissus had lent breath to them. On a suddaine the blew enamelled Portcullis of heaven flew open, and there issued out three Triumphant Chariots, the first drawne by an harnassed teame of Peacocks, and deckt with boughes of Cedar; Herein sat Iuno , wife and sister to mighty Iove , Queene of Crownes and Mines, the Nuptiall Goddesse, and Protectresse of the Geniall bed. The second Chariot was drawne by Marius his Eagle, and Prometheus his Vulture, and stuck about with wreaths of Oake, Palme, and Bayes; Herein sat prudent and Potent Pallas , the Issue of Ioves better part his braine, Empresse of Arts and Armes, Commandresse in chiefe in the Pierian greene , and the Pharsalian field. The last and lightest Chariot, (before which ran a Bevie of naked Nymphs and little Cupids , strewing Roses and Violets in the way, and singing of wanton Ditties,) was beset with branches of myrtle, and hung thick with hearts transfixt with arrowes, others flaming, Virgines girdles, Garlands, and worlds of such like Love-Trophies; it was drawn by a paire of milkie Doves, who bild and wantonized as they went, as if they were inamoured of eithers whitenesse, which excelled Winters finest downe, the neck of Leda's aged Swan, and what ever else knowes a name, but the hand of her whom they drew, which was Lovely Venus , Crowned with her star, Queen of hearts, Soveraigne Mistris of Love and Beauty. Now alighted those three Deities from their shining Chariots, and came marching with awfull pace, (lackyed with Glory and Majestie) over the hony suckled plaines of Ida , by Cloris spread with verdant plush for them to tread upon. The timorous Stripling was extasied at their Angelick presence, as the Arcadian Fishermen were when they saw that brave Triton , the incomparable Prince Pyrocles riding (as on horseback) upon the mast of his mangled ship, (full of unmoved Majesty, as if he had been the Neptune of that Ocean, waving his sword about his Crowne, as though he would threaten the world in that extremitie) and (as they their sweating Oares) he was about moving his heeles to carry him out of the dint of such glorious spirits; but that Monsieur Mercurie their winged Postillion, beckened to him with his Caduceus , and staid him with these words: "See ( noble Prince ) how much thou art in Ioves books, and what a large share thou possessest of his Royall favour, who has sent the three Deities majorum Gentium , his owne Wife, Daughter, and Neece, through the spangled Orbes, to plead a writ of Honour at thy Barre , and hath given in errand to me, his feathered Herald, to make the motion , and procure them audience; thus then the Cause is stated; "Dame Ate an exploded common Barretter , Mistris of revenge  & debate,  "Neve foret terris securior arduus aether, "Lest Chrystall mantled heaven should be Securer than the Earth, and Sea, "puzzled its Peace, and conspired to sow her seeds of dissention among the Celestials; nor did it suffice her to play at small game, but she hath set at enmity the goddesses of the first rank, Saturnia the Great, Tritonia the wise, and Aphrodite the faire, by casting of a Golden Globe among them (as they sate enjoying themselves at a Banquet-Royall whence she was excluded) with this Inscription, Give this to the fairest , to which each layes claime, and swels with disdaine to heare her title questioned, for the clearing of which they all attend thy sentence, and are to stand to thy award. "His Coelestiall Majesty waved the determination of this controversie himselfe, because he would not disoblige any such Deities; wherefore he removed the Sute from Heavens high Court of Chancery , hither, where he constitutes thee the Iudge , and commands thee to make Ida the Court of Equity . Take then Highborne Prince , this wager of three Goddesses contention, designed for the best deserver, and let thy impartiall judgement in disposing of it to her, evidence, that Astrea hath not yet taken her flight from Earth." Mercurie retreated, having made Paris Guardian of the Ball, whose amorous eyes were now more clogg'd with change of Beauties, than King Mydas was once with gold. Now this, now that, now one by one he beheld; this seemed faire, that as faire, the other fairest; one was full of awfull Majesty, the other of audacitie tempered with meeknesse, the third of beauty waited upon by all the graces; whilst every winning feature did intangle his intricate fancy, as liking all alike, he loved, confounded in his election, Iuno (with a sleeke forehead) advanced forward, and thus became her owne Advocate . "Grow Royall Plant, and bourgeon every moment, till thy touring top invades Heaven, and thy magnitude fils Earth, and all the Inhabitants shelter themselves under the shadow of thy Imperiall branches; which is all in thine owne power to command, if thou wilt obey me, and that but in being just to thy selfe, and me, in preferring before two meaner Nymphs (with whom my spleen swels to be ranked) me, that have the Monopoly of Crownes and Scepters in mine hands, in reward of which I'le turne over my Patent to thee, and for that little yellow Globe , make this great one thine. Thy most ambitious and avarous thoughts are too narrow to comprehend the moitie of those honours and treasures that shall spread and prostrate themselves before thee ( my young ambition ) I'le swell a Diamond into a grosse Mountaine, lofty as Tenariff , spacious as Ida , and will congeale a heap of Pearles into a lucid Rocke, then command Vulcan and his Cyclopean Journeymen to hew them into two faire Pallaces, which I will moat about with the wealthy streames of Tagus , and his golden- sanded Brothers, Ile furnish them with spoiles of Sea and Land, and environ them with a shade of golden Apple trees, transplanted from Hesperides , and these ( my Darling ) shalt call thy Pallaces of Pleasure . I will begirt thy browes with such a circle as shall seeme to be made to shame Earths spangled Canopie, even when most gorgiously sparkling with starres, in nights chiefe pomp; and (believe it) no face shewes so beautifull as that that looks from under a Crowne. "I'le rifle all Natures secret Cabinets to find Jewels worthy to embellish thy shining Scepter withall, with the wagging of which thou shalt charme all minds to subjection, as Mercuries Caduceus did Argus his eyes to slumbering. "Make but these petty Goddesses subject to me, and I'le make all subject to thee, thee to none; all the Spheres shall seeme to move as thou byasest them, the whole frame of the Creation depend upon thy will, thy frowne shall shake the world off the hinges, and both the Poles into an ague; thy command shall levell mountaines and raise vallies, make aspiring spires kisse the Center , and lowly stones the Sun; thou, not fortune, shalt make of a Consull a Rhetor , of a Rhetor a Consull , as if there were not any fate but thy favour, no all-disposing Providence, but thy pleasure. "I'le furnish thee with a spruce Regiment of supple Courtiers , which shall Eccho thee, and observe thee as thy watch does thy clock; And turn like Turkise in thy Ring, and looke well or ill with thee, and be true Heliotropes to you their Sun.  "------Erit satis una Vox ad decretum, Nutus ad Imperium. "Thy sleightest wordlike Persian Law shall stand, One Nod shall be sufficient to command. "Every Look of thine shall be a Law, every Syllable a Statute, confirmed and ratified, with a Sic jubet Paris , a foundation as strong as the Center . "I'le prevaile with Nature to create some new Beasts, whose precious skins shall make the Bever and motley Ermine of none account, and with them I'le clad thy body. I'le make a sturdy Vnicorne come and crooch at thy feet, thou mounted, he shall exalt his horne, and scorne the Asse that carried the Æ gyptian Osiris , and by his strutting pace prouder than ordinary, shew he knowes what weight he beares. "The Sun shall be thy Helmet, and he only with his feather-footed Coursiers shall be able to make the Foure of thy Dominions. Each City which thou shalt visit in thy Royall Progresse shall seeme on fire, all Steeples shall Eccho thy ![](/images/inline/KHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif)  , all Pies and Parrots shall be taught that note, which the wild Burgesses of the Woods shall learne of them (as once they did of Psappho's flatterers) and sing it every morning. All Conduits shall run with the richest Falernian Wine, all thy paths shall be spread with Simyrimis Tapestry, every street shall be throng'd with Pageants, every harth shall smoake with bruised Nara and Masculine odours: the Virgins shall keep Holy-day, and crowne their dangling tresses with wild Ivy, every one shall assume a leavy speare; every hand shall be wearied with binding its head with Fillets, to beare thine health. Every mouth shall be full of thy praises, every tongue shall sing Io , and salute thine eare with Songs, whose burdens shall be,  " Jupiter in coelis, Paris egit omnia terris, Divisum Imperiu cum Jove Paris habet. "In Heaven Jove , on Earth Paris sway doth beare, And Territories with the Thunderer share." Now did Saturnia retrograde, leaving Paris thoughts gilt with the reflection of Oare and Crownes, and the birth of Ioves braine tooke her place and spoke after this manner. "I know ( green Bud of Honour ) that every accent and Particle of this Queens Oration tickled, and spoke musicke to thine eare, and me thinks I see thee even feast, nay surfeit thine eye with those mountaines of profits and glories she boasts of; but make not thy sense the measure of things: For sense like the Sun expands and reveales the face of the Terrestriall Globe, but conceales and seales up the face of the Coelestiall. Give eyes to thy Reason, and try if thou bee'st so Eagle-sighted as to discover Wisdom and Knowledge in their Courtly dresse, which hadst thou once glanced upon with thy corporeall eyes (as thou maist with thy mentall, by contemplation) thou wouldst allow nothing else faire. "These are the Legacies which I bequeath, these wherein Man excels Man, in that wherein Man excels Beasts, and Gods Men, Knowledge and Arts. "I'le make thee the Atlas Physicus, & Naturae Arnspex intimus , Nature shall make thee her Cabinet-Councellor, and unlocke all her jewels to thee. "All the Sciences shall be thine handmaids,  & liberally bestow themselves on thee. 1. Thy fluent tongue (the Embassador of thy mind) shall expresse thine Idea's in such an Emphaticke stile, with genuine words so made, and filed for the matter, as every sentence shall be a new Grammar . "2. Thy oyly speech (the Index of thy soule) shall be deckt with Rhetoricall flowers, as the Spring (the youth of the yeare) is with naturall ones, the sweet fragrancie whereof shall surprise every one with pleasure, pleasure with liking, liking with loving, loving with faith, for what we love we beleeve best, in the superlative. "3. What ever stamp thou settest upon things shall make them sterling, what thou affectest thou shalt easily effect , what ever thou reason'st of, pro or contra , shall retaine alwayes the colours thou paintst it with, indeleble as an Æ thiope ; all thy Arguments shall be received for Authentick Aphorismes , and Ipse dixit Paris countervaile an Ergo ; Thy Logicke shall knit such Gordian knots , as no subtill hand of Art shall be able to untie, or edge of wit to cut asunder, but to thee every thing shall be vox significans ad placitum . "4. Thy mouth shall be Musicks Temple, resounding with Anthems tuned with Notes above E La , so that Orpheus (the great Organist of Heaven) shall borrow aires from thee to set the Spheres with; and every Syrens shall stop their eares with wax, for feare of doting upon thee, as once Vlysses did his, for feare of being betraid to their treacherous charme. "5. Philosophie shall bestow her Stone on thee, and turne all thou touchest into gold, or which is more, all thou treatest on into satisfaction, the truest treasure. Labirynthian Paradoxes that are bones to others shall be milke to thee; Æ nigma's that rest in clouds to the rest, shall be all Sun to thee; and heights which others cannot soare unto by strong faith, thou shalt reach with Reason. "6. Thou shalt make a new edition of, and addition to; Arithmeticke , and compleate her with numbers enow to count those many Atomes whose accidentall concourse made this big-bellied earth, and how many minutes have thrust out one another since that accident happened. "7. Thou shalt make a geometricall girdle for the massie ball, and reckon how many inches make up her vast dimensions; that done, like a Palmer with thy Iacobs staffe thou shalt passe beyond the firmament. "And that thou maiest mix pleasure with profit, the sister quire shal make thy head their Parnassus , thy mouth their Hipocrene , whence shall flow such streames of Poetick Nectar , as shall water thy name many Century's of yeeres hence, and render it odoriferous as the East. Thy verse shall turne Prometheus his Vulture into a wanton Pigeon, and bespangle Heaven with new Starres, and fill fames Roll with Hero's : so shalt thou live by them, they by thy story; they the glory of men, thou of wits. Yet to compleat thee, for that small circle, thou shalt ride in circuit upon the Vehicul ae Scientiarum , Languages, through all the severall Provinces of Learning; and how profitable and pleasing a thing is it to have the orbs of the mind concentrique with the orbs of the world. "By this thou shalt be rendred more thy selfe than thou art now; for a mans understanding is the chiefest part of himselfe, according to most mens accounts, as is evident, in that they abhorre more to be reputed fooles, which is a defect contrary to the understanding, than to be counted vicious, which is a defect contrary to the will. "The swiftnesse of thy apprehension, thy penetrating judgement and soaring invention, shall render thee the theame of honours tongue, and make every moment of thy life notable; together with thy energency of fancy, which thou (being borne to a Crowne) hast more use for than thy neighbours, that thou maist know how to mix moralls with politicks. For knowledge (which is not onely the excellentest thing in man, but the very excellency of man,) is the Basis, and Mother of all the vertues Royall ; without it there can be no true fortitude : for Perils are the daughters of Fury, and Fury is a passion, and passions alwaies turn to their contraries, and therefore the most furious Orlando's when their first blast is spent, are usually the most pusillanimous Dametases or Clineases . Without it there can be no Liberality ; for giving is but want of audacity to deny, or discretion to poise. "Without it there can be no Iustice ; for giving to a man what is his own, is but fortune, or want of a corrupter, or seducer. "Without it there can be no Constancy , or Patience; for suffering is but stupidity. "Without it there can be no Temperance ; for we shall restraine our selves from vertue, as well as from vice: for he that cannot discerne, cannot elect or chuse. Well therefore said one of the scientificallest of my sonnes. Then shall people enjoy the height and influence of felicity, when either Kings be Philosophers, or Philosophers Kings. "Neither ( Delight of fortune, if thou pleasest ) judge of my gifts by what thou knowst of them already; no more than thou wouldst do of a Jeweller or Lapidaries store, by that onely which is set out towards the street in his shop. I have another donative in store for thee, if thou bee'st not thine own foe; thou shalt share as much of Mars in the hand, as of Mercury in the head; so that fame shall find it taske enough to imploy all her breath in, to tell the admiring world how many stubborn Nations thou hast subjugated, and how many high and arduous attempts thine owne single prowesse has atcheived; which shall at the same instant both delight and affright the Auditors. Thy name shall conquer like Zisca's Drumme, and thy triumph be certaine before the Battell; who so stands against Paris , by Paris shall fall; thy foes shall be to thee as waves to a rock, thou to them as fire to ferne. Philosophers and Generals shall fetch their Authorities and Stratagems from thee, then Oracle of wit and warre; every day shall present thee with a new Palme; to thy honour Games shall be invented which shall thrust the Pythia and Olympiads out of esteeme: every champion field and plaine shall stand thick with Pillars, and cloud-high Pyramids , Temples, Statues, and Agulieos erected in memoriall of thy Trophies and Victories, which shall make thy terrible name Rivall with time, for the victory of perpetuity." Now retreated Tritonia , leaving Paris building castles in the aire, and erecting Trophies in his thoughts, when faire Aphrodite approached with a world of winning majesty in her looks; and as the Elixar turneth all things into gold, so the Sunny beames of this illustrious Deities eyes, (whose every motion shot ten thousand Cupids into the hot Phrygians soule) reflecting upon his, soon affected him with her passion, and made him ready to prostrate (without further cunctation) the Ball , with his glowing heart, at her feet. First she slipt downe her loose flower-embroydered mantle, and inriched his gullon eyes with the wealth of her lovely breasts, those nectar running fountaines, as farre excelling those two Pallaces of pleasure which Iuno even now promised, as they did the humble colleges that were the mothers of the Capitoll ; and before she opened the cherry of her lips, she emparadised him with a winning smile, such a one as if hell afforded the like, who would not post thither, esteeming the sulphurous flames coole, in comparison of his desire of the fruition of such lovelinesse? Having pleaded with his eye with such silent (though flexanimous) Oratory; she next charmed his eare, the other principall sense of inquisition, with such such like raptures, "Place not thy heaven ( Noblest of hearts ) in those things that have transformed earth to Hell, viz. Gold and Iron , I would have thy life ( Deerest ) more of kin to the Golden age , when no Viper cared to rip up the bowels of his mother Earth, or plunder her entrailes of her best concocted dust; when there needed no elaborate circumvallations, or Trenches, no Palizado's or art of Enginery, to keepe out hostile Troopes, but the unarmed people had for their defence a wall of innocence and love, "It will better beseeme thy tongue to beare a part in some sweet oyly-melting ditties, highly pen'd, and sung by a faire Queene in a summers bower, with ravishing division on her Lute, than to speake tearmes of mannage to a bounding steed. "That fresh and blooming cheek (sweet as Aprill , flourishing as Iune ) was not made to be withered with night watchings, like an old Apple Iohn ; nor were those blossomes of beauty bestow'd on thee to be weltred in a study, or nipt by tedious marches. It better becomes thy bud of youth, and the flowring spring time of thine Age, to spend the naked summer in the cooler shade, and the slower winter by the hearth. "Make me ( Deere Wanton ) mistris of that narrow sphere, and thou shalt alwaies move in one of delight, as spacious as desire. "On this pleasant rising ground ile plant a chequer'd Mirtle grove for thy divertisement, on each branch whereof shall pearch a plumed Chorister, and there shall Philomela (the harmelesse Syren of the woods) ply the nimble wing from tree to tree, teaching the groves to chant the Legends of her Loves, and the heaven she found in Tereus his strict embraces, to tast which once more, she shall wish as often as there are trees wagging to her song, to reassume her pristine shape, that she might be ravished againe. "The pavement shall be enamelled wiih Violets that rol'd themselves in the cooling blood of my tender Adonis , and weare it still for a Livery. There shall the Dazies jet it in their double ruffes, and griev'd Clyte now an Heliotrope pursue her coy Titan whom I made once to follow coyer Daphne to as little purpose. There shall the Daffadiles poure all their teares out of their dewie cups; for ther's not a leafe shall be an Vmbrella for sorrow, but the pretty mixture of Flora's treasury shall make the gaudy earth seeme another Glaxia , embossed with Starres, which shall never know sun-burnt Autum of frozen winter, but by Zephyrs flowry Brises shall be perfumed and rendred as thy selfe flourishing. "Here the toyling Bee's (the Muses birds) shall make another Hybla , and every hollow tree shall present thee with the sweet sweat of their labour. This pallace of the spring will I water with serpent Rivolets of Milke, and Nectar , (fragrant as my breath) which I will sluce into small winding Cataracts, (as the veines in the body) to indent the ground, and moisten every part, and musically play with the blew pebles, as they wantonly glide by, and make thy sleep softer than it is. "Here shalt thou wash away the sweating of August in the flowing juice of the rocks, and bath in the spirits of Iuly flowers, Musk-Roses, and blew veined Violets. "Hither will I send a wanton Bevie of sportive waggish Nymphs to attend thee, and to gather for thee (as it was in the Saturnian times of yore) Wildings and Strawberries of the Wood (which shall wrinkle their cheeks with laughter, for joy to be thy messe) and to feast thy palate with delicious Honey, dropping from green Holy-Oakes, and with sweeter too distilling from their prettily swelling lips, which shall be balme to cure the deepe wounds of Love; balme sweeter than the dew that lies on Roses when the morning opens, and ushers in the day with dubious light. Here shalt thou see nothing not excellent, so among such equally eminent variety, thy observing eye shall not know of which to serve thine heart; this shall seeme mildly majesticall, that of a sweet complexion, this pleasantly entertaine, that charmingly allure; here shall stand a proper Girle, there strut a goodly ambling Nymph , the next a gay Brownetta , as if Iupiter had hither brought his thefts; among these, might wandring Cadmus have sought his missed sister, and Ceres her Proserpine , every of their looks shall be as attractive as the Thracian Lyre , and lead all thy senses captive after them. "I'le weave the tops of foure comely Sycamores and Mulberies (the wisest of trees) that mourne in the blouds of Pyramus and Thisbe , (having friendly Vines lovingly clasping about their Barkes) into a retiring roome; the dropping Woodbine and odorous Suckling, with the Roses of both hewes, shall be the Arras to line this bower within. "Under this shady canopy shalt thou repose, upon a green couch embroybered with Hyacinths and Crowtoes, and whereon my young soft Paramore shall live in a pale anenomy; and there shall Crocus and Smilax (whereof the one might have fil'd Nectar in Ganimeds roome, the other have waited in Hebes stead) now changed into two pretty flowers, embrace one another, and smell fragrant as of late did their desires. "And now ( young Dardanian ) unlesse thou beest frosty spirited, unlesse Alecto's cold poyson fills thy veines, I'le melt thee into amorous thoughts, and speake charmes to all thy senses, and make thee all flame. "Make me thy friend and (Goddesse like) I sweare by the blacke Stygian fen, to throw into thine armes the onely perfect piece of natures pencill, by it (scorning art) painted of such a colour, as is the Ivory of India , distained with vermillion, or the snow of a Lilly married to the scarlet of a Rose. A matchlesse Paragon whose perfections shall be many and yeares few. A beauty whom the best verses and pencils have extol'd, the faire argument on which all wits shall imploy their oratory; fresher and sweeten than a new blown Rose- bud, whiter and softer then a dying Swans down, or the down of a Thistle; nimble and sportive as a young Roe, wanton as the wind, that curles her hair; faire as the morning, cleere as the noone, ruddy as the evening, sweet as the spring (the faire mother of flowers) ripe as Autum, better in all things than desire; one for whom Prometheus tempered better clay than ordinary, or (to say better) he composed her of soule stuffe; one for whom Clotho kept her best and finest wooll; one in whom the fates meant to shame all their former workes, and in her composition so exhausted their treasury, as ever since, such fragments of woman as others are, be daily thrust into the world; one upon whose peerelesse face (so full of loves and Cupids ,) millions have waited for Almes; one to whom Princes and and wits have bent, and homaged, and whole squadrons of Lovers have besieged and sought to storme, with whole volleies of obedientiall oaths, and the hollow Granado's of complement. She that hath been the rack of thousand soules, the flame of thousands hearts; (who would willingly have offered up themselves in their owne fires sacrifices to her) she shall not cost thee one sigh, or teare of despaire, but shall freely come to meet thy embraces, and shall every day increase thy affection by new merits. Tell me for Loves sake, is it not more lovely to lie intwined in her foulding armes, like a Lilly imprisoned in a Jaile of snow, or Ivory in a band of Alablaster, than to sit muffled in furres like a bedrid Miser? "Let desperate persons endure the thunder of warre, and the haile-shot of oft redoubled stroakes; then shew a rent scarse stained with (perhaps innocent) bloud, as a trophe, or a fragment of a torne banner; the meanest of her favours will make a goodlier show. How canst thou be meane, being Lord of her who is beauties Kingdome? or poor, enjoying the wealth of her golden haire? "1 She shall be the feast of all thy senses ; thou shalt see the Sun (the great Lynx of Heaven) divided in her eyes, lightning with such splendor as put out the beholders, killing and reviving with frowns and smiles at pleasure; in short, thou shalt behold before thee the model of heaven, and pride of earth. "2 Thou shalt smell in her breath a fragrancy that admits no comparison with the Panthers breath gathered in bags, and mixt with Cretan wines, or with the Eastern spices on the Phenix pile, when she her selfe is both the Priest and the Sacrifice. "3 Thy tast shall find in the swelling Apples of her breast, the Katherine Peares on her cheekes, and the balme-bedewed Cherries of her lips, such sweets, with which the tongues of Nightingales, the heads of Parrats, the braines of Peacocks and Estriches, prepared (in sawced dishes) by the cunningest cost-neglecting Cookes, are not worthy to be named the same day. "4 To thy touch shall ly open the warme snow and soft pollished Jvory of her body, which excels in softnesse the ranging clouds, the Indian Cotton, or Cotshold Wool, in sleeknesse the smoothest cut Diamond, or Looking-glasse. "And thus (to the suspense of the listning Nightingales who grieving to heare a sweeter voice than their owne, shall fall downe and die upon her Lute,) shall she (the Orpheus of the world) charme thine eare . "From th' early Dawne, till Sol retires, On beds of violets wee'l lie toying. Wee'l quench, then kissing, fan loves fires: Happy blisse, ther's none to this, A Lovers heaven is injoying. " Cockles our Lips shall teach to cleave, (whilest no Argus eye controules,) Our spirits out at our mouths we'l breath, Mine into thee, thine into me, So in each kisse wee'l exchange soules. Wee'l mix our selves till our blouds turn Elixar , which the Fates shall mould To moddels of us, they shall burne With desires, hot as our fires, Whilst we in eithers armes grow old. "Nay most of all, she shall be sprung of the seed of the Gods, and what an honour is it to call Iove Father in law! "Wouldst have thy Nymph described? I might borrow heavens milkie way to paint out her forehead by, I might call it a plaine of Lillies, or a shrine of snow whither multitudes have come Pilgrimages. "I might compare her eyes to those of night, or rather that of noone, and call them Spheres of light, flaming strongly and inkindling all others, but that were to dishonor them with the beggarlinesse of the similitude. Suppose her cheekes two faire gardens planted with the choicest flowers of Paradise, but the Lilly and the Rose are but obscure types, and shadowes of those delicate tinctures laid on her blooming cheekes by Natures Pencil. Imagine her neck a Towre of Alablaster, her breasts hillocks of snow inlaid with Saphires, her mouth Musicks Temple, deckt with two railes of Pearle, her voice the chiming of the Spheres: But these are but faint Metaphors of her, to represent whom, words are too narrow, and freshest colours too dim. "Rather I wish that thy enfanched eyes were as sharpe as an Eagles, or Tiberius his whilest thou doest survey my forme, and if they spie any thing in me that may challenge their liking, be confident thou shalt enjoy it in as high a perfection in that Beauties heaven, who shall every minute coine new artfull postures, and try the variety of my stealths, to make thy delight immortall; So that you shall be the happiest pair that fry under the Torrid Zone of Love, hourely in that Elizium quenching and renewing your heats, and letting your selves loose to the freedom of uncontrouled embraces. "If thou hast a fancy to invent arts and try conclusions, here shalt thou have fit opportunity to surpasse Ovid and Aretine , and become Professor in "If Armes and Duells comply with thy Humor, thou shalt never want action, the soule of Love, her paps like two Pomegranates rising up on either side with a gentle and tempting swelling, shall as they beat, give both a signall, and a challenge to the encounter. And when thou art foiled, and cast into a qualmie sound, one kisse shall infuse new spirits into thy panting limbes, and arm thee for a fresh charge; and thou shalt alwaies be above thy sweet foe (the extract of delight) in these feates of Armes; these not destructive but productive warres, instead of killing the Champions shall produce new ones. Thus ( Happy wanton so loved of all the Starres ) shall pleasure become thine handmaid, and the crop of thy joyes be ripe as harvest in the Aprill of thy yeeres." These airy blandishments and raptures, made the hot Phrygian big with the desire of their accomplishment, and quite chased the glory of Crownes and Triumphant Charriots out of his head, and drown'd all their pleasures in the thoughts of the sweet fruition of his Queene of sport and Lovelinesse, who did already swimme in his fancy, his thoughts dwelt no where but on her, whom like another soule, he longed to enjoy. As Pha eton at the first did fearefully admire even the Pallace of Ph aebus , but anon fearelesse adventure even the presence of Ph aebus : So Paris who even now trembled at the Goddesses Port, was now bold enough to reject two of them; without the least conflict in himself which to make his Patronesse, with a fixed resolution, and a wandering eye, he spake in such a Dialect. "A flowry chaplet subtly woven by the cunning hand of a Wood Nymph , is a sweeter and lighter wear than a Crowne, which causes the headach with its weight, and carries a crosse on its top; and is commonly as deep and thick inlaid with troubles as Jemmes. The whole lives of Princes are like a Chesseboord, or their Ermynes , they have as many black spots as white, wherfore they shake hands with freedom (the splendor of life) that gape after such gilded toiles, which when they are possessed of, they had need borrow ambitious mens conceits to thinke themselves happy, the Gall is so predominant over the Honey. "I am heir to one Crown by birth, and Iove grant that Liberty and Priviledge do not justle that off my head, which if they doe, I will scarse lift it thither againe; for Soveraigne Monarchs are like the celestiall bodies, they have much veneration, but no rest. It was the desire of power that flung Angels out of Heaven, and the fever of knowledge that thrust man out of Paradise: wherefore neither do I desire to be reared to that slippery height, whence a fall will dash me in pieces, like those wretched creatures that are drawn higher the more to be strapado'd ; nor doe I thirst to drink of the Horses spring , or drench my selfe in Castaly , I mean not to undertake a Pilgrimage to Athens , an unwearied travell after wit, nor care I (like wormes) to seed upon old bookes, some whereof tell us that Pride precedes a fall ; now whats a greater stirrup for pride than much knowledge? which to this day retaines in it somewhat of the Serpent (its first Atturney) wherfore when it enters into a man it makes him swell, Scientia inflat . "I'le never be Rivall to those candle-wasters, that alwaies stinke of Lamp-oyle, in woing any coy Art but Musicke: for what serves your sleepy Astronomy but to enhance the price of Night caps, and furr'd Gownes, and to make men catch cold? I'le not tie mine eyes to the Starres as if I were made the Argus of the Heavens, to watch the wandring planets motions, none of which I'le ever trace but Venus . If you will needs have me taken with Arts, I like better the art of giving than taking of lives. I desire not to warme me by that fire struck in the Devils tinderbox, War alias Woe, that common wrack of common-weales . Let my brother Hector decke his pride with scarres, and make fine lame showes of his wounds, in hope rotten Fame wil make him the burthen of her song; for my part I desire not to see the inside of Ianus his temple; but may Turtle footed peace ever dance Fairy rings in my Land. "I love not blacke and blew prowesse, nor is it musicke to mine eare to heare bones rattle with magnanimity. Fortitude is a vertue of the Iron Age , and a goodly vertue sure which even drunkennesse can induce? Shall I learne of the Gyants (that God contemning race) to affect thrones, and so become a mark for Ioves Thunderbolts? or of Cadmus his harvest of men to love fighting, and so water the earth with my bloud in recompence for bearing me? No, with Regality dwels cares, with arts unrest, with armes danger; but Love is the true embleme of Heaven, or rather Heaven upon Earth, for Heaven is more the joy than the place. Love is made up of the Elixar of delights; shall I then invite feare for my Comrade, and Trouble for my bedfellow? and reject that excellently excellent Nymph, so faire, so gentle, so good, so shap'd, so quallified? no Deare arme-full of Roses and Lillies, thy embrace shall be my ambition, thy armes my court, thy breast my field, thy bed my tent, thy eyes my books; And you faire Cypria my Patronesse, to whom as to the worthiest I adjudge the Golden Orbe , which with my better service, (rare Summary of beauty, therefore of desert) may it please your Deity to accept." This disposall made the two rejected Goddesses his inexorable adversaries, and most Philomathies and Martialists his criticall censurers, he is onely cry'd up for a Minos of good judgement among Amorists and Beauties, one out of which number (between whom and her that bore away the Golden prize there is no difference but a Mole and a Name) one (who had she been in the number of the competitors the Apple must have been divided between Erycina and her ) whose least command is more obligatory with me than an act of Parliament, have enjoyned me to Apologize for him, and to say somewhat in applause of his preferring before the rest the faire Paphyan Queene, whom I implore to be President at the rites, and to inspire me whilst I plead hers and her Judges cause; and I wish that to delineate her deserts and omnipotence, I had a quill snatcht from the wing of her amifying Sonne, and dipt in the Nectar of her own Milk. But I will not make Minda's large gates to my little City, nor dwell long upon a Proem, for to make too much preamble is tedious, and to make none at all, but blunt. To unpassioned men, this Trojans judgement will not appeare like that of Æ sops Cocke, that prefer'd the Barly kernell before the Jewell; or of Vlysses Qui vetulam pr aetulit immortalitati ; or of Mydas , who being elected Judge between Apollo President of the Muses , and Pan Captaine of the sheepish Squadrons, judg'd for plenty; or of the Asse in the fable, who prefer'd the Cucko's note before the Nightingales; but of a nobler, and more reasonable nature, as will concisely appeare by these few animadversions. First, in respect of himselfe, common policy prompted this Prince to this disposall, for he being made Umpire between three Deities wherof he must make one his friend, and two his enemies, it was his wisdome to winne favour with the most Potent, which was indubitably Venus , if vee may take an estimate of power from the extent of dominions, and largenesse of command and conquest; all which are so cleerely Cypria's as they leave no place for opposition, or objection. Its true Iuno commands the World, but Venus monarchizes in the most unlimited manner of soveraignty over millions of worlds, if it will passe for sterling that every man is a Microcosme ; and though some sonnes of Earth are so inthrall'd to sense as Saturnia swaies in some of these lesser worlds too, yet many are so refined from earth and ignorance, as they acknowledge no alleagance unto her, but he that submits not to the scepter of the Paphian Queene is a Rebell against nature, and but the shadow of a man; but such stubborne ones are as rare as a horse in the streets of Venice , or a beggar in Holland. Petronius indeed once blasphemed and wrote Satyrs against our Goddesse, but he soone sung a Palinodia , and spent his last breath in chanting of amorous Odes. This is that powerfull Planet that makes not onely rationall but irrationall, not onely the animate, but inanimate creatures, and vegetables feel her influxious power. So that she commands the three soules that animate the world, the vegetative, the sensitive, and the rationall, one whereof is infused into Plants, two into Beasts, all into Men. No creature (as Saint Hierome concludes) is to be found Quod non aliquid amat , no stock or stone that hath not some feeling of Love. Even Flowers and Plants feele her influence, the faire Primrose (the first borne of the spring) if forsaken of the masculine flower, droopes and withers disconsolate, as if she kept her beauty onely for him. The Heliotrope was inamoured of Golden-hair'd Titan , and still at his presence unmaskes (as if he came to court her) and converts towards him; the Vine, the Elme, the Cabbage and the Olive dote upon and manacle one another in their armes; the Olive and the Mirtle intwine their roots and branches if they grow neer. Palme trees are of both sexes, and expresse not a sympathy, but a Love passion.  Vivunt in Venerem frondes, omnisque vicissim, Felix arbor amat, nutant ad mutua Palmae Faedera, Populeo suspirat Populus ictu, Et Platano Platanus, Alnoque assibilat Alnus. Leaves sing their Loves, Each complementall tree In courtship bowes, the amourous Palmes wee see Confirme their leagues with nods, Poplars inchaine Their armes, the Plane infettereth the Plane. Florentius tells us of a Palme that loved most fervently, and would not be comforted untill her Love applied it selfe unto her, you might see the two trees bend, and of their owne accord stretch out their boughs to embrace, and kisse each other. They marry one another, and when the wind brings the smell to them they are marvelously affected: they will be sicke for love, ready to die and Pine away, which the Husbandman perceiving, strokes those Palmes that grow together, and so stroaking again the Palme that is inamoured, they carry kisses from the one to the other, or weaving their Leaves or Boughes into a Love-net, they will prosper and flourish with a greater braverie. But the greatest Triumph of Love in these kind of Vegetalls was in the two Italian Palmes, the Male growing at Brundusium , the Female at Otranto , which continued Barren, till they saw another (growing up higher) though many Stadiums asunder. Dionea is that Omnipotent Power that puts motion into a Stone, and strikes fire from Ice, and makes cold water sensible of her heat: this is shee that made the amorous Brook Alpeus pursue the coy and flying River Arethusa , from the Stymphalin Woods, (piercing earths hidden Bowells) through cold Emyranthus and Ellis , till they ran both in one Channell, and mingled Waves.  Flumina senserunt ipsa quid esset amor. Triumphant Love hath made cold water fire, And give and take the flame of warme Desire. The nimble Birds are overtaken by Cupids nimbler wings, and annually elect their Valentines . What a perfect Harmonia of affection is there between the Turtle and his deare mate? whose continuall billing shames Diana , and her Icy-fouled traine. What a zealous adorer of our Goddesse is the wanton Sparrow, who empties himselfe of all his Radicall moysture in her Rites, and at three yeares end, (when that Columne of life fails him) offers up his dry bones a Sacrifice to her. The Eagle of Sestos , and Peacocke of Leucadia were both betrayed to the Love of Virgins, and having zealously served them here, followed them to Elizium , as that wonder of a Dog did his Master Sabinus. Aristotle will have birds to sing ob futuram Venerem , for joy and hope of their stealthes to come. The Idalian Archer makes the Inhabitants of the flouds his Bulls too, and pierces the Armour of their glittering scales; he placed among his Trophies the sluggish Whales, the Triton of Epirus , the crook-backt Dolphin that was inamored of Hernias , and him (at Puteoli ) that loved a childe and would carry him upon his backe as the Lord of his Affections, and after dyed for losse of him. Pisces ob amorem marcescunt, pallescunt, &c. Fishes pine away for love, and wax leane, if Gomesius Authority may be taken, and are Rampant too; some of them. Venus takes Diana's worke out of her hands, and wounds and intangles in her toyles the four-footed Citizens of the Forrest. Furor est insignis equarum . How insatiable is the Leacherous Goat? The Cowes runne and lough in the Valley, and the fiercer beasts make the trees quiver and be all Aspin, at their roaring not for their Prey, but absent Loves; Cupid is as familiar with Lions as Children with Cosset Lambes, and often-times gets on their backs, holding them by the Maines, and riding them about like Horses, whilst they fawne upon him with their tailes.  Omne adeo Genus in terris hominumque ferarum, Et genus aequoreum, pecudes, pictaeque volucres In furias ignemque ruunt, amor omnibus idem. All kinde of Creatures in the earth, beasts grim, And men, and fish with golden gills that swim, And painted birds alike to rage doe flie, Thus Love beares equall sway, in Earth, Sea, Skie. Lest any thing should escape her, she catched that nimble wonder of volacity, the Winde its selfe Boreas , he that in his rage tosses the blew Billowes, curling their monstrous heads, and teares up knotty Oakes, and makes the massie Ball to stagger (like a drunken man) when he flies through her hollow entrailes and crannies, she made this Fury turne all mildnesse, and convert himselfe into gentle brieses, to fanne Orythia's rosie faire haire, whom being denyed he bore away in a blast. The Spirits of the Aire, and Devills of Hell are subject to Love, else what meane the Stories of Incubus and Succubus , of Nymphs, Faunes, Satyres, Faires , and those lascivious Telchines , about whom the Platonists spent so many Pen-ploughed Reams of Paper? Excellently said that well-worded Noble Italian, Baptista Guarini , in his Matchlesse Pastorall, Il Pastor fido , upon this Theame: \------Look round about, Examine the whole Universe throughout, All that is faire or good, here or above, Or is a Lover, or the work of Love. Th' all-seeing Heaven, the fruitfull Earth's a Lover, The Sea with Love is ready to boyle over. Pallas has but few Subjects, and these adore Venus too; nay, shee her selfe may be call'd (without Sol aecisme) Venus her hand-maid, for Valour is a Page to Love, not Love to Valour; for none in that Valiant are taken with this Love, but once wounded with Love, they become so, and undantedly undergoe all perrills for the beloved.  Improbe amor quid non mortalia pectora cogis. Tyrant Love, what canst not thou Compell poore mortall men to doe? The valiantest Field-men have been no Niggards of their bloud in Loves quarrell, which sharpens their Swords aswell as their Spirits. What made Persius combate that immense Prodigie of Nature and the deep, Medusa , that drove the broad-spread waves before his mighty breast, but the Love of Andromede? and having loosed her from her Gyves, (farre unworthy of so faire a Prisoner) and changed them for Hymens sweeter Bands, What made Phineus rashly turne the Nuptiall Feast into a Sanguinary Fray, and make the clashing of bruised Armour and groanes of his dying friends his Epithalamion Notes, but the Love he bore to the same illustrious Lady? Arithmetick wants Numbers to reckon the Tilts and Turnaments, the Combates, Wounds, and Deaths, that such quarrells have caused, whilst the brave Aspects of lovely Dames did Tantara to the fight, and their favours wag in sight. It's no newes to heare that Erycina takes Victory its selfe Prisoner, and makes the Victor Captive to his Captive, as she did the redoubted Amphialus to the divinely divine Philoclea, Iupiter to Calisto ,  & Hercules (the scourge of Monsters) to faire Omphale ; to comply with whose humour, hee left off his Lions spoile, to weare ( Sardanapalus -like) womens soft Robes, and with those hands with which he drew bloud, hee drew the slender thread, (which trembled to bee spun by such terrible fingers) and held a feeble Distaffe with that arme which used to beare the knotty Club, and thresh Tyrant Champions like a bunch of Hempe, or a Stock-fish. These were his Interludes between his Acts, and when his Ribs were well beaten , and grew crasie , then would he retreat into her Lap (the Bay of sweet Delight) as into Loves Port , to be new built for further engagement. Cupid has made the whole body of Philosophy and Divinity too, to tremble at the twang of his bow, the greatest Masters of Wit and Reason have coveted no higher subject to heighten their Fancies than great Loves Supremacy, and the Encomiums of some Beauty. How did sweet-tongu'd Petrarch trudge up and down after Laura? How was Loves great Master Ovid enamoured of bright Iulia , (the Iewell of his soule) and Celebrated her excellencies and their stealths under the maske of Corinna? Did not Cytheris possesse Cornelius Gallus his soule, and Plautia Tibullus his? Did not smooth Propertius place his heaven in Cynthia's Love, who being ravished from him by injurious Atropos in the heat and hight of their best dayes, how did it cracke his Sinewes, shrinke his Veines, and make his very heart-strings jarre, and so enthrall'd him to Melancholy Don Saturne , as hee lockt himselfe up in her Tombe, who alive served in stead of a tenth Muse unto him: of which wittily the Epagrammatist:  Cynthia te vatem fecit Lascive Properti , Ingenium Galli Pulchra Lycoris habet, Fama est Arguti Nemesis formosa Tibulli , Lesbia dictavit docte Catulle tibi. Non me Pelignus , nec speruit Mantua vatem, Si qua Corinna mihi, si quis Alexis erit. Wanton Propertius , and witty Gallus , Learned Catullus , and subtile Tibullus , To Cynthia, Lychoris, Lesbie , And Nemesis you owe your Poetry: Naso , nor Maro should not call me bad, If I a Corinna , or Alexis had. Mercury , (whose Caduceus is said to asswage the rage of the Sea, in that contentions are appeased by the flexanimous power of Eloquence, and discreet Negotiation of Embassadors) he who was said to steale Apollo's Arrow out of Quiver, Vulcans Tools out of his shop, and Iupiters Scepter, (shewing the bewitching force of his facundity) was not hee Love-strucke when hee saw Herse bearing to Tritonia's fane her Sacrifice, in a crowned Basket, upon her shining haire? and how did hee bend his wits to sollicite her sister Aglauros to procure him accesse? Nay, Apollo himselfe, the Inventer of Poesie, Musick, and Physick, elated for his Victory over the ugly Python ; found Cupids Shaft the most prevalent, when he pursued the over-much loved, but over-much hating Daphne , over the uncouth Rocks, craggie Clifts, and untrod Mazes of the Woods. Againe, the Celestiall heat was inflamed by a Terrestriall, and he who used to look indifferently upon all, cared to see none but Leucoth oe , for whom his looks waxed so pale, a colour sutable to his griefe. Afterwards being banished heaven for a year, for slaying the Cyclops that made the Lightning that slew his Sonne Pha eton , he turned Herds-man, and kept the cattell of Aametus King of Thessaly , for the love he bore to his faire Daughter. Afterwards he assumed those Weeds againe, to enjoy Issa , Daughter of Macarius Prince of Lesbos , so unmajesticall is Majesty where Love hath a footing. This is that ancient passion that vies Antiquity with any time, as Ph aedrus contends, and was (according to Hesiod ) begot by Terra and Chaos , before the gods were borne.  Ante Deos omnes primum generavit amorem. Love is the elder Sister of the gods, Or Mother that gave them beings, & abodes. Cupid is more than quarter Master among the gods; Thetide aequor, Vmbras Æaco, Coelum Iove, &c. For proofe of this Antiquity of Loves Supremacy, History tells us that this Fire (which some think to be that that Prometheus fetcht downe from heaven) burnt so hot in old Saturne , (the Father of the gods) as it made him willing to goe out of himselfe, and become a horse to beget Chiron the Centaure on Philira , and ever since it hath ruled the three Provinces, (with their Rulers) that his Dominions were divided into, viz. Hell, Sea, and Heaven; excellently expressed by that Poet Laureat (to whose Name, Wit and Art must bow, and are justified only by honouring it) in his Hue and Cry after Cupid in his Marriage Maske . At his sight the Sunne hath turn'd, Neptune in the Waters burn'd, Hell hath found a greater heat; Iove himselfe forsook his Seat. From the Center to the Skie, Are his Trophies reared high. So that it was no Heresie in Orpheus to make a petty Pope of him, and give him the Keyes of heaven and hell, Claves habet superorum & inferorum . Nor was his Herald Ovid out of the Story, when he thus blazed his Stile;  Regnat & in superos jus habet ille Deos. Love commanded Pitchy Pluto (that holds the inferior Province of the triparted world) to ravish Proserpina , from the sedgy Banks of Pergusa Lake. Love made the green Glassie god of Waves to bow his Trident to her Scepter.  In mare nimirum jus habet orta mari. Shee that from the Ocean sprung, Hath right to rule the Waves among. This watry Proteus became for Arne a Bull, for Ephimedia the turbulent River Enipus , for Bisalpida a Ramme, for Ceres and Medusa a Horse, for Melanthe a Dolphin, &c. And lest Heaven should remaine freer than Earth, Sea, and Hell, Love struck great Iupiter , the scatterer of three-forked lightning, with the likings of Io, Semele, Latone, Alcuma, &c. And made him Metamorphose himselfe for Europa into a Bull, (and put himself to graze that he might lick her hands who fed him with flowers) for Danae into a storme of Gold, in which shape he stormed Acrisius his Tower, (and here he made Iuno , Gold, serve Venus , Love,) for Astrea into an Eagle, for Leda into a Swan, for Antiope into a Satyr, for Æ gina into a Flame, for Mnemosyne into a Shepheard, for Dois into a Serpent, for Calisto into a Wood-Nymph or Nun, so much hee esteemed his pleasure above his state: So as Lucians Iuno call'd him Ludus amoris, Cupids Whirlegig. I need not here insert how Bacchus became a Grape for Erigone , or remember the rest of the Gods stealths; it's sufficient to prove Aphrodite the potentest of them all, in that all vaile to her and her sonne, she to none. Wisely therefore did Paris to dispose of the Ball , so as hee made the Ruler of the triple world his friend with it. Secondly, I applaud his judging for the Sea-born Queen, when I consider the quality of the gifts that the three goddesses were Mistresses of. The one could lade his head with Starry Crownes, the Badges of the gods, and ambition of men: but why should his great mind stoop to that Lure which even a Cynick could disdaine? Did not Diogenes preferre his Tub before the Luculent Throne of Alexander the Great, the whole worlds terror? which proud humility so pleased that mighty Hero , as hee thought that carelesse Snails condition better than all mens, but his owne, wherefore he broke out into such expressions, I could wish to be Diogenes rf I were not Alexander; but he and they that stand upon the pinacles of State, need not boast their slippery height, but remember they walke not upon a Helix that still enlargeth, but upon Fortunes wheele, whereof having reached the top they must descend to the lower spokes, as did Darius the Potent, Osman the Proud, (whom a Ianizarie dispatched) Belizarius the valiant, Crasus the rich, Priamus the faire, Nero the cruell, Seianus the haughty, cum multis aliis qu ae nunc, &c. More wretched in the evening of their lives than Irus , for miserum est fuisse felicem , Had I wist is an idle speech. Whether doe these Crowns and Scepters the worlds magnolia , but indeed the bals and rackets of Fortune, hurrie men? through how many restlesse nights and lesse restfull thoughts doe they chase these sweet bitter joyes? as the more we grasp the theevish sands, the faster they steale through our fingers: so is content the farther from them the more they seeke it in the fading glories of the world, which like an Ignis fatuus first lead them through wild untrodden paths, then by vast aiery thoughts to that Precipice, whence they fall and are torne like Absyrtus . Iuno could also have made him Master of inexhaustible mines of gold, the soul of the world, the price of lives and Lawes, the Terminus ad quem , to which most actions are byased: but why should a Prince make that his Ruler which Plato banisheth from his Common-wealth, as the mother and nurse of vice, and an envious spirit exciting to sacriledge and murder? This was too poore a bait to take Nobilitie, which was sleighted even by the Shepheards of Arcadia , a happy people, wanting little, because they desired not much. But this meanes Paris kept himselfe from the fever of avarice, for such is the sacred hunger of gold , that who so enjoyes most of it, seeks ( Volpone like) by sordid penury to accumulate more. But is it not the height of folly to live poore all a mans life, to die rich? The other Goddesse could have decked his head with ever springing bayes , and fill'd his hand with triumphant Palme , the price of bloud and sweat. I confesse it was some unhappinesse that he looked upon these with so transient, and carelesse an eye: eye said I? had it been in the power of his Opticks to have reached such objects, as Prowesse (the metall) and Knowledge (the varnish of a man,) it would have removed all hesitations and scruples from him, and made him have devoted himselfe to the Lady of such treasure, and Lovelinesse:  Non per Deos, aut Pictor posset, Aut Statuarius ullus fingere. Talem pulchritudinem, quale Pallas habet. Nor Gods, nor rare Vandicke , nor Raphael brave, Nor nice Pyrgoteles , that in Pearles did grave, Can feigne such Beauty as Arts & Prowesse have. But how could he be taken with this amability since it was not visible? since Aristotle (Natures great Secretary) affirmes, Nemo amore capitur, nisi qui fuerit ante forma speci eq; delectatus , no man loves but he who was first delighted with the comlinesse and formositie of the object? The true Idea of valour and wisedome Paris could hardly forme in his mind, but he might easily throng his head with thoughts of tedious marches, dangerfull attempts, sleep-breakings, night-watchings, mortall wounds, and thousand other Gorgons heads that sense held out to deterre him; so that who could imagine he should aspire to that as a reward, of the perill and trouble whereof he had a full prospect, and but an eclipsed glimpse of the glory? He saw but the thornes that hid the Roses, and even this glimpse was much clouded by the refulgence of the third Deity, the beames of whose eyes (those twinnes of light) so dazzled his, as he could looke at no other object, so fares it with a man that forces his eyes against the Sun. The eye and the eare be the Cardinall senses of inquisition; and though the eare is the conduit-pipe of Faith, which (as sacred Rolls report) comes by hearing, yet certaine it is that the eye takes in the perfecter notions, and presents the truest Idea's to the mind, and that one ocular witnesse is worth ten auricular. Suppose a couple of Apples were profered to a child, the one as faire as any in Sun-burnt Autumns store, as beautuous as that which tempted Eve , but of no extraordinary operation, the other but of an indifferent rind, and somewhat withered with lying, but restorative, and of an excellent vertue, would any one blame the child (seeing he cannot see the intrinsique worth of the other) for chusing that which gave a pleasant taste to the eye, before it was seized by the teeth? No more cause have we to chide with Paris for rejecting of Pallas for Venus , since he could not discerne the worth and beauty of the one, (it being hid in the secret Cabinet of her soule) but might of the other, since his eyes were full Masters of the rare object of her exquisite Phisnomy, and divine feature, with which sweet looks she caught all her beholders by the eye-lids; and being so rarely faire, he might well thinke her as rarely vertuous, for vultus index animi , the frame and composition of the mind doth follow the frame and composition of the body: so where the bodies furniture is beauty, the minds must needs be vertue, grace and beauty are so wonderfully annexed, so sweetly and gently allure our soules, that they confound our judgment, and cannot be distinguished, which made the ancient Poets put the three Graces still in Venus company, as attending upon her, and holding up her traine. Neither is the reward that Venus could have bestowed on Paris to be set in the reere, but deserves to be ranked in the first file of desert; and if we consider Paris as Paris , and not as a Prince, hers of all the rest was most necessary for him, she could restore his rib to his side, which who so misseth, wants halfe of himselfe. His fortune might play her selfe, and suffer one that had more yron than he, to take away all his gold, for fortune is like April in raine, or the Moone in the last Quarter, it will soone change; but Venus could throw into his armes a friend without change, a Play-fellow without strife, that after his thoughts had kept full Terme , and been drowned in the deep Idea's of State, could have brought him cheerfull and vacant intervalls, and proved the best Heleborum against Melancholy. Did he desire to extend his life beyond his life, and make the Ages to come his owne? she in requitall of his Princely embraces, could yeeld him reall fruits of his love, little living Pictures of himselfe, that should alwayes carry him about them, and transmit him to posterity, they to eternity. Thus might he swallow time its selfe, and outlive himselfe. Euen Iuno afterwards thought this the most prevalent Argument, and therefore the chiefe motive she used to Æ olus to let loose his destructive breath upon Æ neas , and his fragments of Troy , as he was transporting of Ilium over the angry Sea to Italy , was, that she would give him De iopeia for a Salary.  Incute vim ventis, submersasq; obrue puppes, Aut age diversas, & disjice corpora ponto. Sunt mihi bis septem praestanti corpore Nymphae, Quarum, quae forma pulcherrima, Deiopeiam Connubio jungam stabili, propriamq; dicabo: Omnes ut tecum meritis pro talibas annos Exigat, & pulchra faciat te prole parentem. Lend crosse winds strength to make the capring brine To kisse the Moon, and swallow every Pine; A beavie of twice seven faire Nymphs are mine: Bright De iopeia , that the rest outshine As far as they doe others, shall be thine; And her to thee with Nuptiall bands I'le twine; She for such merits shall spend all years with thee, And make thee Sire of a faire Progenie. And its more than probable that Iuno would have used this Argument to Paris , but that she knew she should have been outbidden by the Queen and Monopolist of Beauty. Thirdly, I cannot but subscribe to Paris his sentence, when I ruminate upon the penalties that either of the Deities could inflict upon him for rejecting of them. Iuno could damme up the rich streams of yellow Tagus (whose foame is Amber, and gravell Gold) from running into his coffers, but no matter, for how could he know want that enjoyed Ioves daughters fair hair? and the freshest Corall (alas too meane a word) the rubies of her Lips, and her Sunny eyes (the staine of Diamonds) the two centers of beauty, wherein all the lines of Love met? In tota rerum Natura, nihil forma divinius, nihil augustius, nihil pretiosus , saith Isocrates , In all Natures treasure there is nothing so divine and sacred, nothing so precious and Majesticall as Beauty, its Natures Crowne, Gold, and Glory; bonum si non summum de summis tamen non infrequenter triumphans . Minerva might make her Mysteries of Philosophy strangers to him, and unlock her secrets to more quick-silver'd spirits, who yet were below his envy; for how many Princes break their sleep with the Quiditis of Ens , or poring upon Aristotles intricate questions in the realitie of Numerus? And yet their governments miscarry not, they having the most refined wits, and mature judgements to be their Participes curarum , and band opinions with them for the safety of their Monarchies. As for her other gift, Conquest , he desired rather (like a good Patriot) to have his Land deckt with Peace, and the child of Peace, good husbandry, than watred with his enemies bloud, or glutted with their fat, knowing that the shining title of a Conquerour did indeed little help to the happinesse of life. But what if he had been strong as Hercules , valiant as Hector , could his force have ransomed Troy from ruine? or underpropt the proud Palaces of Priamus ? No, said his excellent Brother that dyed laden with so many trophies of Honour:  \------Si Pergama dextra Defendi possunt, etiam hac defensa fuissent. If any Hand could have defended Troy , This hand had stav'd off her annoy. Few Columnes are gilded with the Memorials of any victory obtained only by the Generals single Valour. But Venus that had his heart in her hand could have made the torrent of his affections run in what channel she pleased, and doted upon some deformed Mopsa , some rotten trunke and rusty face, the spoile of Age and triumph of uglinesse, whom (when the scales were fallen from his eyes) he should have discovered to have been a Beldame foule as the beast that suckled him, then would her harsh haire (which once he thought finer than flax) appeare near allyed to Foxes Furre, her complexion Cousin germane to the swart Indian , or tawney Moore ; her breath (which once he thought fragrant as the West wind) should then smell like an Obolet able to blast a flower, and her whole composition prove the torment of his eyes, and this plague he could no way fly:  Quo fugis ab demens, nulla est fuga, tu licet usq; Ad Tanaim fugias, usq; sequetur amor. Ho whither Lover? no flight is left for you, Clime heaven, sound hell, stil will your flame pursue. Or Venus in revenge might have transfixt his heart with a golden shaft, his Mistresses with a leaden one, to make her hate; her that might have carried life in her looks, death in her mouth, Iune in her eyes, Ianuary in her heart, and what a torment this would have proved, let the pale cheeks of Apollo and Petrarch testifie. 4\. Another reason that induceth me to stand to his award, is, because he judged for the most innocent and blamelesse of the competitors, her whose life was not stained with so many spots as the others. Iuno had a black soule in her not faire body. No visor can maske her cruelty to Pious Æneas , and his weather-beaten Navy (which the high hand of Providence had pluckt (as firebrands) out of Troyes flames) and to poore Io , whom her anger transformed to a heifer, and committed to so rigorous a Guardian as boorish Argus , who bound her yvory necke with an unworthy halter, and fed her with bitter sallads, (who deserved Ambrosia ) and watred her at the brook (which when she went to tast, she oft ran back, as afraid of her owne face) who merited Nectar , and allowed her the earth only (not alwayes green) for her bed, once not unworthy of the thunderer himselfe. No lesse cruell was Iuno to the divine Nonacrine Calisto (who once inflamed her old Letcher) in lading her whileome lovely skin with horrid rough haire, and converting her limber fingers (once compacts of warme snow and soft yvory) into ugly Pawes, and making that mouth to grin (so that she was afraid of her owne voice) which was erst so praised of Iove . None will excuse her malice against Semele , whom she sought by unworthy covert treachery to destroy, metamorphising her selfe into her old Beldame Nurse Beroe of Epidaure . No hate so deadly and certaine, as that which is masked under the visor of love; for that like thunder hits before it speaks:  Tuta frequensq; via est per amici fallere nomen, Tuta frequensq; licet sit via, crimen habet. T'maske fraud with Love hath safe & common been, Though a safe & common way, yet is't a sin. See her spight, who contending in a wanton quarrell with Iove which Sex had most pleasure in the act of Venery, he saying the Female, she the Masculine, Tiresias (who had twice changed his Sex) being elected Umpire, confirmed Ioves words, and affirmed that in coiture men had but three ounces of the vigour of Love, women nine; for which her deadly hate deprived him of both his eyes. With what fury did she agitate the subversion of the house of Cadmus? did not she too excite the Furies to the ruine of Athamas and Ino , (for no other cause than for their pitty and piety in fostring their Nephew Bacchus , whose mother Semele her rage had already tragedized) descend by the horrid shades of deadly Eve , to Dis his dire Palace, and there commanded, promised, and intreated all in one breath, and at last incensed Tisiphone to prepare for them bruised Hemlocke, the spurgings of dead mens eyes, mad doggs foame, Frogs bloud, the juice of Mandrakes, Adders eares, horned Poppey, Cypresse boughs, Basilisks bloud, Infants fat, Scritchowles eggs, blacke Cats brain, Henbane, Nightshade,  &c? with these and more such poisonous drugs, she so infuriated them, as the father Athamas dasht out the braines of his owne sonne Clearchus , and the mother Ino , (having snakes hissing about her head) precipitated her selfe, with her other child Malacertes , from a rock into the Ionian Sea; then Iuno (like an enemy to the humane race) turned all the fleshy hearted Theban Ladies that pitied them into Cadmean Fowles, or Statues and Monuments of her revenge and envy. I need not remember her turning of Hemus a King, and Rhodope a Queen, into Thracian Mountaines; the Pigmean Matron Gerannica into a Crane (who now bids battell to her owne subjects) Antigone the faire daughter of Laomedon into a Storke, who still claps her wings to her owne Plaudite. Certaine it is that none was more cruell, malicious, or jealous than she, none more revengefull in her jealousie, insomuch as she could not forbeare the Dedalian Statue, which angry Iove threatned to marry, but upon the reconciliation caused it to feed its owne destruction, fire. Nor was Pallas altogether immaculate, the pride of her haughty spirit would not let her acknowledge any equall, no not in the common Art of spinning, no not Arachne her selfe, Arachne that made the pretty Nymphs of Tmolus often forsake their Vines, and the sleek Pactolian Nymphs their pratling streames, to looke upon her rare warps, but her her cruelty made a contemptible Spider, who still intangles Art (like flies) in her cunning Network, which the subtilest hand is too grosse to imitate. This Goddesse also gave somewhat too much way to Anger and fury when she sent a fury to torture poore Aglauros (one of the Cycropides ) only for being a little long tongu'd, like the tyrannous Fairy that entailes the sides of Tell-tales to the print of her nailes. But some grave streight-laced Matron (who is constant to one, because her superannuated feature doth not please any other) may cavill that Venus was not without her Mole, but was guilty of falsifying her Conjugall trust, she looked with one eye upon Adulterous Mars , with the other upon Horned Vulcan , whom she taught the note of Aprill , and made his blacke browes to bud. But this Peccadillo is too light to weigh with the others grosse enormities; this fault (if it deserves that name) falls under a capacity of Pardon, as proceeding from infirmity, but murder and malice from presumption; she was so far from murdering any, as she would rather make more; she was so far from sending Furies to torture any, as she was willing to prevent their tortures. What Fury is more terrible than Love, the Queen of Passions, to whom all other are subject, she to none?  Mallem cum Leone, Cervo,  & Apro Ætolico, Cum Anteo, & Stymphalicis avibus luctari mavelim, Quam cum amore--- I'de rather cope with the Æ tolian Boare, Anteus , or beasts that in Nem ea roare, 'Gainst the Stymphalides my strength I'de prove With better hope of Palme, than 'gainst great Love. This powerfull Conquerour leading the King and God of Conquerours prisoner to Venus in a red Rose chaine, so that he whose sinewie necke never bowed in battell, he whose stronger strength the strong tempered steele did obey, became servile to her coynesse, she pittying the hell he burnt in for the heaven of her embrace, let him take her bed for his tent. This was only the fruit of a fleshy heart, and good Nature. Doe we not exclame against those who having abundant store of wealth, yet suffer the needy to perish at their doores for want? With as good reason may we chide with those Ladies, who being rich in Beauty (scorning Art) suffer their Loyall Amorists to dye for love of them unpittyed. And why might not one Venus serve both Mars and Vulcan within heaven (both being twins in love to her) as well as one Virgo doe the Gemini without heaven? 5\. But it cannot be with any forehead denied, that Astrea her selfe prompted him to this disposall, because therein he followed the will of the Donor, of this prize of beauty, which was the Motto it bore; Detur pulchriori, Give this to the fairest: Which if we expound literally to be meant of exterior beauty, doubtlesse to her it belonged, if we judge it meant of interior beauty of the mind, yet to her, because she was not spotted and contaminated with so many vices as the rest. But some may object that Paris did violate the League and Law of Nations, in robbing of Menelaus a Soveraigne Prince of the best jewell of his life, his deare Helena . This I may answer with that Proverbiall axiom, Fallere fallentem non est fraus , to deceive a deceiver is no deceit. His Aunt Hesione was detained Captive in Salamis by Thelamon , under pretence that Hercules when he razed Troy , bestowed her on him, she not restored, being demanded by her brother Priamus his Legates, Paris by stealing of the Spartan Queen cry'd the Grecians quit. Who ever blamed Dido and the Tyrian Lords, for robbing avarous Pigmalion of his heaps of gold? as little cause have we to wrangle with Paris for this amorous stealth: For if we be angry with Corn-ingrossers, and misers that hoord up a little worldly pelfe, why should we not as well blame them that ingrosse rich beauties, so much the more, by how much the treasure that they ingrosse is more divine and precious than their trifling riches? But some may object, that Paris by this judgement made himselfe as his mother Hecuba dreamt he would prove, the firebrand of his Countrey; 'twas he that did devast and destroy Troy , sometimes strong in wealth and wals:  \------ Notissima fama Insula, dives opum, Priami dum Regna manebant, Nunc tamen sinus, & statio malefida carinis. An Ile whose wealth (as fame of old did know) Within as free, as Seas without did flow, Whilst Priam did her flourishing Scepter sway, Now rubbish, and to Ships a trecherous Bay . This brought seventy Kings and Kingly Peeres from Greece with twelve hundred fifty five War ships (whose golden Poops did gild and staine the blew ennamell of the deep) to block  & coop him up for ten yeares ten moneths, and twice six dayes. This waked the Lyon War, and made eight hundred sixty thousand Greeks staine the Trojan weapons with their dearest bloud, and sent six hundred fifty six thousands of Trojans fighting men, (besides the slaughtered at the Sack) to engarrison, and take up their Quarters in the Kingdome of perpetuall night; omitting more of little lesser fame, the noble bloud of forty Kings ran A Tilt, if we allow Hector, Troilus , and Paris that title. The free sword tooke liberty to act all that it pleased, and was as familiar with entrailes as the Augures ; all hate had licence given it, all fury had loose reines, slaughter and death bestrid the streets, whilst the gore he shed flowed up, and stained his thighs, and carried downe whole heaps of limbs, and mangled bodies, which the coles of their owne flaming houses roasted; no sex or age escaped, infants in the Porch of Life, the sicke, the aged that could not hope one day more from natures bounty, fell, some to fil up the number, some to make the prey, it was crime enough that they had lives. Pluto's covetous boat-swaine fainted, and asked a Fleet rather than a Boat to ferrie over those sad soules to the blacke world, whose bodies the mawes and Dennes of Beasts could scarce containe, the whole Earth became a Grave, and all to satisfie a hot Lust. But if this had not happened, the world had lost that high Example of filiall duty and piety that Æ neas gave, in burthening his shoulders with his feeble and most aged Father Anchises , and (leading by the hand his sonne Ascanius of the age of twelve yeares) bearing him through the wastfull flames, maugre the wrathfull foes into the fields of Phrygia . Out of these ashes also sprung the worlds Ph aenix , the Roman Nation , that gave Lawes to all the rest, and the Brittish that performed acts of more Palme than Fame has breath to blaze. And we have no reason to call Paris the Viper that eat out the bowels of his Countrey, because this sad event of his judgement was hid from his eyes. If Nature had made every man a Prometheus to contemplate, or a Tiresias to prognosticate the event of things before the action of them, or if we all had our Nativities calculated to our hands, and were fore-warned of, and so fore-armed against those Legions of perils that should encounter us in our lives warfare, there would be no need of the veneration of Fortune , or repairing to her fane to implore her Protean Deitie to be auspicious to us in the conduct of our affaires; for a disease when knowne is halfe cured, a wound discovered is recovered , and a danger that is expected is toothlesse and halfe prevented; but we are not all allyed to the Sybils , nor have we the gift of divination shared amongst us, because we should have our minds intense upon heroicke atchievements, and still ae mulari meliora , and leave the sequell to vertue, who never failes to elevate her patient sonnes above the reach of chance. And as Ignorance is held to be the Mother of Devotion; so (in this point) its the cause of most mens industry: For if all carried their destinies inscribed on their foreheads, such as were condemned to hew their livings out of the Rocks, would never appeale to Fortune to divert her harsh sentence, but would sit downe in despaire, and sigh out with Tacitus ; Fortun ae saevienti submittendus est animus, or with Seneca ,  Fatis Agimur, cedite fatis, Non sollicitae possunt curae Mutare rati stamina fusi. By resolute Fates we guided be, To their pleasures submit we, No care can alter their decree. The Median and Persian Fates are not like that pack of petty Tyrants that make Acts and Ordinances to day, and vote them void too morrow, no, their inalterable Order is out, that we should alwayes tug at the Oare, nor can our anxious care contrive a way to ransome us from these katches , under which we must ever lye at dead Anchor ; wherfore its better for us to subject our necks to the yron yoke of servitude (forged for us) with Sheepish patience, than like the wild Bull strangle our selves with strugling to breake that net from which we shall never unintangle our feet, and so by their sighs of desperation (as with bellowes) they augment the fury of the inraged wind , whereas if the love of Vertue could make them swell their sailes with breathings after the Cape of good Hope , they might perhaps arrive at the Port of Honour. E contra , if men were no greater strangers to their ends than to their beginnings, those that Fortune had selected for her minions, would expect still to be dandled upon her knee, and that the Cornucopia and redundancy of her best favours should drop into their mouths, whilst they (like Marcus Lepidus ) stretcht themselves upon Flora's green Carpet. Therefore lest the ardour and breathings after fame should be refrigerated in Cadets by their despaire of soaring above the gutter, though they should spread and try to flutter with their Estrich wings of faint hope, or in others by their presumption of being borne up to Promotions hill on the shoulders of their smiling Fate, and there to find warme lodgings which they never swet for, prudent Nature lets no man know what the plot is that she intends in the severall Scenes of his life, till he comes to act the Epilogue , which (contrary to other Comedians ) he usually desires to protract. Some in their passage through this elementary world find their way strewed with Roses, and their paths spread with butter, others prick their feet with bryars and thornes, and stick fast in the muddy sloughs of trouble, and are compell'd like Haniball (upon the Alps ) vel viam invenire, vel facere , to find or make way over the hedges and ditches of incombrance: And as a Pilgrim that steeres his unknowne course to some remote shrine, when he comes at a crosse way, is apt to take the fairest path; Semblably we, when we meet with any thing ambiguous, take our owne construction, which is ever such as the pulse of our affections beats after, and we sooth up our selves that herein we deviate not from truth; for facile credimus quod volumus . Thus Æ acides demanding of the Oracle what event his War with Troy should have, he interpreted the Oracles answer, which was,  Aio te  Æacides Trojanos vincere posse. Æ acides to vanquish Troy , I able doe pronounce. Thus, I say thou art able to subdue the Trojans , whereas he should have construed this Amphiboly in this wise, I tell thee the Trojans are able to vanquish thee . And that other Prince who enquired whether or no he should make a prosperous expedition against his enemies, and had this in a scroule,  Ibis redibis nunquam per bella peribis. Thou shalt goe thou shalt returne never war shall end thee. Put the second comma where he would have had it meant, viz. next that verb Redibis , whereas he should have placed it next the Adverb nunquam , and thus falsly animated he ingaged, and breathed his last, in the Attempt. Thus the Ilian Prince Paris having the 3 Goddesses standing before him, and pleading for the prize of beauty , conferr'd it upon Venus , because he conceiv'd, she being the potentest of the three (in that she boasted her Trophies over the chief of the rest) was most able to doe him good or hurt, and that he should be so perfectly felicified in what she could confer upon him, as all the scruples of gall that the other two Deities could cast into his sweet messe could not be able to imbitter it.
