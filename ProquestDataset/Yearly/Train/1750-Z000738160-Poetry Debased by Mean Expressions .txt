 is poor in the opinion of some, may by others be envied for his wealth. general character of them who use them; and the disgust which they produce, arises from the revival of those images with which they are commonly united. Thus if, in the most solemn discourse, a phrase happens to occur which has been successfully employed in some ludicrous narrative, the gravest auditor finds it difficult to refrain from laughter, when they who are not prepossessed by the same accidental association are utterly unable to guess the reason of his merriment. Words which convey ideas of dignity in one age, are banished from elegant writing or conversation in another, because they are in time debased by vulgar mouths, and can be no longer heard without the involuntary recollection of unpleasing images. amidst the violence of his emotions into a wish natural to a murderer, \---Come, thick night! And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes; Nor heav'n peep through the blanket of the dark, To cry, hold, hold!--- In this passage is exerted all the force of poetry, that force which calls new powers into being, which embodies sentiment, and animates matter; yet prehaps scarce any man now peruses it without some disturbance of his attention from the counteraction of the words to the ideas. What can be more dreadful than to implore the presence of night, invested not in common obscurity, but in the smoke of hell? Yet the efficacy of this invocation is destroyed by the insertion of an epithet now seldom heard but in the stable, and dun night may come or go without any other notice than contempt. ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , his lance rages with eagerness to destroy; if we are alarmed at the terror of the soldiers commanded by C aesar to hew down the sacred grove, who dreaded, says Lucan , lest the axe aimed at the oak should fly back upon the striker. \--- Si robora sacra ferirent , In sua credebant redituras membra secures , we cannot surely but sympathise with the horrors of a wretch about to murder his master, his friend, his benefactor, who suspects that the weapon will refuse its office, and start back from the breast which he is preparing to violate. Yet this sentiment is weakened by the name of an instrument used by butchers and cooks in the meanest employments; we do not immediately conceive that any crime of importance is to be committed with a knife , and at last from the long habit of connecting a knife with sordid offices, feel aversion rather than terror. MACKBETH proceeds to wish, in the madness of guilt, that the inspection of heaven may be intercepted, and that he may in the involutions of infernal darkness escape the eye of providence. This is the utmost extravagance of determined wickedness; yet this is so debased by two unfortunate words, that while I endeavour to impress on my reader the energy of the sentiment, I can scarce check my risibility, when the expression forces itself upon my mind; for who without some relaxation of his gravity can hear of the avengers of guilt peeping through a Blanket? less acquainted with the common usages of the age; they are therefore wholly imperceptible to a foreigner, who learns our language only from books, nor will strike a solitary academick so forcibly as a modish lady. are of more importance than an early entrance into the living world. The seeds of knowledge may be planted in solitude, but must be cultivated in publick. Argumentation may be taught in colleges, and theories formed in retirement, but the artifice of embellishment, and the powers of attraction can be gained only by general converse. necessary likewise for other purposes. The injury that noble sentiments suffer from unsuitable language, personal merit may justly fear from rudeness and indelicacy. When the success of Ã† neas depended on the favour of the queen upon whose coasts he was driven, his celestial protectress thought him not sufficiently secured against rejection by his piety or bravery, but decorated him for the interview with preternatural beauty. Whoever desires, what none can reasonably contemn, the favour of mankind, must endeavour to add grace to strength, to make his conversation agreeable as well as useful, and to accomplish himself with the petty qualifications necessary to make the first impressions in his favour. Many complain of neglect who never used any efforts to attract regard. It cannot be expected that the patrons of science or virtue should be solicitous to discover excellencies which they who possess them never display. Few have abilities so much needed by the rest of the world as to be caressed on their own terms; and he that will not condescend to recommend himself by external
