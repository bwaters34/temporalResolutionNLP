"RIDICULOUS as this conduct mu[s]t appear in the eyes of all judicious people, it is too frequently practi[s]ed to e[s]cape observa-tion. "I WILL drop this piece of morality, with a charge to the fair reader, that whenever [s]he di[s]covers a fatire, ridiculing or recriminating the follies or crimes of mankind, that [s]he look into her own heart, and compare the [s]trictures on the conduct of others with her own feelings." [1] THIS young lady was of a reputable family in Connecticut . In her youth [s]he was admired for beauty and good [s]en[s]e. She was a great reader of novels and romances, and having imbibed her ideas of the characters of men  , from tho[s]e fellacious [s]ources, became vain and coquetish, and rejected [s]everal offers of marriage, in expectation of receiving one more agreeable to her fanciful idea. Di[s]appointed in her Fairy hope, and finding her train of admirers le[s]s [s]olicitous for the honour of her hand, in proportion as the ro[s]es of youth decayed, [s]he was the more ea[s]ily per[s]uaded to relinqui[s]h that [s]tability which is the honour and happine[s]s of the [s]ex. The consequences of her amour becoming vi[s]ible, [s]he acquainted her lover of her [s]ituation, and a hu[s]band was propo[s]ed for her, who was to receive a con[s]iderable [s]um for pre[s]erving the reputation of the lady; but, having received security for the payment, he immediately withdrew. She then left her friends, and travelled in the [s]tage as far as Watertown , where [s]he hired a young man to conduct her in a chai[s]e to Salem . Here [s]he wandered alone and friendle[s]s, and at length repaired to the Bell-Tavern , in Danvers , where [s]he was delivered of a lifele[s]s child, and in about a fortnight after (in July , 1788) died of a puerperal fever, aged about 35 years. Before her death [s]he amu[s]ed her[s]elf with reading, writing and needlework, and though in a [s]tate of anxiety, preserved a cheerfulne[s]s, not [s]o much the effect of insensibility, as of patience and fortitude. She was [s]en[s]ible of her approaching fate, as appears from the following letter, which was written in characters. "MUST I die alone? Shall I never [s]ee you more? I know that you will come, but you will come too late: This is, I fear, my la[s]t ability. Tears fall [s]o, I know not how to write. Why did you leave me in [s]o much dissstress? But I will not reproach you: All that was dear I left for you; but do not regret it.---May God forgive in both what was ami[s]s: When I go from hence, I will leave you [s]ome way to find me; if I die, will you come and drop a tear over my grave?" In the following Poem, [s]he, like the dying Swan , fings her own Elegy, and it is here added, as a [s]orrowful instance, how often the be[s]t, and mo[s]t plea[s]ing talents, not accompanied by virtue and prudence, operate the destruction of their po[s][s]e[s][s]or. The de[s]cription of her unfortunate pa[s][s]ion, will remind the critical reader of the famous ode of Sappbo . In genius and in misfortune, the[s]e poetical ladies were similar. " DISAPPOINMENT . "WITH fond impatience all the tedious day I figh'd, and wi[s]h'd the lingering hours away; For when bright He[s]per led the [s]tarrytrain, My [s]hepherd [s]wore to meet me on the plain; With eager ha[s]te to that dear [s]pot I flew, And linger'd long, and then with tears withdrew: Alone, abandon'd to love's tendere[s]t woes, Down my pale cheeks the tide of [s]orrow flows; Dead to all joys that fortune can be[s]tow, In vain for me her u[s]ele[s]s bounties flow; Take back each envied gift, ye pow'rs divine, And only let me call Fidelio mine. "Ah, wretch! what angui[s]h yet thy [s]oul mu[s]t prove, Ere thou can[s]t hope to lo[s]e thy care in love; And when Fidelio meets thy tearful eye, Pale fear and cold de[s]pair his pre[s]ence fly; With pen[s]ive [s]teps, I [s]ought thy walks again, And ki[s]s'd thy token on the verdant plain; With fonde[s]t hope, thro' many a bli[s]sful bow'r, We gave the [s]oul to fancy's pleafing pow'r; Lo[s]t in the magick of that [s]weet employ, To build gay [s]cenes, and fa[s]hion future joy, We [s]aw mild peace o'er fair Can aan rife, And [s]how'r her ble[s][s]ings from benignant [s]kies; On airy hills our happy man[s]ion ro[s]e, Built but for joy, no room for future woes; Sweet as the [s]leep of innocence, the day, (By tran[s]ports mea[s]ur'd) lightly danc'd away; To love, to bli[s]s, the union'd [s]oul was given, And each! too happy, a[s]k'd no brighter heaven. "And mu[s]t the hours in cea[s]ele[s]s angui[s]h roll? Will no [s]oft [s]un[s]hine cheer my clouded [s]oul Can this dear earth no tran[s]ient joy [s]upply? Is it my doom to hope, de[s]pair and die? Oh! come, once more, with [s]oft endearments come, Bur[s]t the cold pri[s]on of the [s]ullen tomb; Through favour'd walks, thy cho[s]en maid attend, Where well known [s]hades their plea[s]ing branches bend, Shed the [s]oft poi[s]on from thy [s]peaking eye, And look tho[s]e raptures lifele[s]s words deny; Still be, though late, reheard what ne'er could tire, But, told each eve, fre[s]h plea[s]ures would in[s]pire; Still hope tho[s]e [s]cenes which love and fancy drew; But, drawn a thou[s]and times, were ever new. "Can fancy paint, can words expre[s]s; Can aught on earth my woes redre[s]s E'en thy [s]oft [s]miles can cea[s]ele[s]s prove Thy truth, thy tenderne[s]s and love. Once thou could[s]t every bli[s]s in[s]pire, Tran[s]porting JOY, and gay DESIRE: Now cold DESPAIR her banner rears, And PLEASURE flies when [s]he appears; Fond HOPE within my bo[s]om dies, And AGONY her place [s]upplies: O, thou! for who[s]e dear [s]ake I bear, A doom [s]o dreadful, [s]o [s]evere May happy fates thy foot[s]teps guide, And o'er thy peaceful home pre[s]ide Nor let Eliza 's early tomb Infect thee, with its baleful gloom."

Mrs. Bourn , with little difficulty, found the title page, and began to read, " A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy, by Mr.  Yorick." "I DO not like the title ," [s]aid Mi[s]s Bourn . "WHY, my dear!" apo[s]trophized the mother, "you are mi[s]taken---it is a very famous book."

He continued his addre[s]s to the book, as they went out, in the [s]ame Shandean tone---"The[s]e anti[s]entimentali[s]ts would bani[s]h thee from the [s]ociety of all books!

Francis was anxious to enquire the cau[s]e of this extraordinary change, but wifely forebore adding to the di[s]tre[s]s of her friend, by de[s]iring her to explain it, in a manner too precipitate. She was in a [s]hort time made acquainted with the particulars of the [s]tory---which is not more melanoholy than uncommon. SOMETIME after the marriage of Martin , the beautiful Ophelia , [s]i[s]ter to Mrs. Martin , returned from an European vi[s]it, to her friends in Rhodei[s]land . Upon her arrival, [s]he received a polite offer from her brotherin-law of an elegant apartment at his hou[s]e in town, which was cheerfully accepted---Fatal acceptation! He had conceived a pa[s][s]ion for Ophelia and was plotting to gratify it.

THIS ince[s]tuous connexion has [s]ecretly [s]ub[s]i[s]ted until the pre[s]ent time---it was interrupted by a [s]ymptom which rendered it nece[s][s]ary for Ophelia to retire into the country, where [s]he was delivered of a child, at once the [s]on and nephew of Martin . THIS event was a [s]evere mortification to the proud [s]pirit of Shepherd , the father of Ophelia . His re[s]entment to his daughter was implacable, and his revenge of the injury from Martin not to be [s]atiated The blaze of family di[s]pute raged with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf034v1T&image=034-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] unquenchable fury---and poor Ophelia received other puni[s]hment from the hand of a vindictive father than bare recrimination. THE affection of Martin now became changed to the vile[s]t hatred. THUS doomed to [s]uffer the blacke[s]t ingratitude from her [s]educer on the one hand, and to experience the feverity of paternal vengeance on the other---and before her the gloomy pro[s]pect of a bla[s]ted reputation---what mu[s]t be the [s]ituation of the haple[s]s Ophelia! Hope, the la[s]t re[s]ort of the wretched, was forever [s]hut out. There was no one whom [s]he dur[s]t implore by the tender name of father, and he who had [s]educed her from her duty and her virtue, was the fir[s]t to brand her with the di[s]graceful epithets, of undutiful and uncha[s]te.

WHETHER from the promi[s]es of Martin , or the flattery of her own fancy, is unknown, but it is [s]aid [s]he expected to become his wife, and made u[s]e of many expedients to obtain a divorcement of Martin from her [s]i[s]ter: But this is the breath of rumour.
