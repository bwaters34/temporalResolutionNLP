 Protection, this little Historical Novel, is that Zeal, which, from Heaven, animated your Breast, and push'd you forward, to be Exemplary in the earliest endeavours of uniting your own Person, and those worthy Patriots, under your Lordships Conduct, to our late Generous Liberator's aid, our now most Gracious Lord and King, in the Freeing of our Distressed Country from those many heavy Pressures under which it had lain groaning so long, and which invited that Personal Valour, with which you so bravely Oppos'd the Multitude, which only could resist, (though not without the forfeiture of their Lives,) your no less Just than Generous Designs. I have entertain'd some hopes, My Lord, that you would be pleas'd to look with a favourable Aspect, on a Piece borrowed from a Design much like that, which stirred up your Honour to lay all at stake, when the True Religion, and the Proper Liberty of the Subject, call'd out so loud on all true English Mens Assistance. I am very sensible, My Lord, of the fair opportunity I have at present, to enumerate, in a large Catalogue, your Honours Noble Qualities and Virtues, according to our Modern way of Dedications; and certainly, My Lord, I could not let pass so fit an Occasion, of following the Mode, but that I had been perfectly inform'd, how much your Honour abhors such Gross Flattery, which has rais'd in me a fear of offending your Lordships Generous Temper, and made me rest contented, with the Relation of those few, but true Passages, cull'd from a prodigious Heap, which, besides the business I had in hand, Justice it self required from me, at the beginning of this Epistle. May your Lordship long live on Earth, to enjoy the Fruits of those Noble Endeavours and Atchievements, and receive hereafter in Heaven, those Rewards laid up for such, as like your Lordship, preferr'd the safety of their Religion and Country, before their own Lives, and all other Worldly Interests; So most heartily Prays, My Lord , Your Honours most Humble Servant, P. B. dreadful Effects of those Rebellions, which, under the specious Cloak of Reformation in Religion, have been stirred up and fomented by the Turbulent Spirits of Wicked Ambitious men; and though our Europe can sufficiently supply us with useful Examples of the same, yet it is not to be fixed wholly to that little Corner of the World; all Countries that the Sun enlightens, have shared in those general Calamities; amongst which, the Ottoman Empire will at this present furnish us with a Story. The Mahometan Religion, which is singular in that vast Empire, is not without Divisions into divers Sects, of which the principal is that of a great Prophet amongst them, named Haly , which was at first the same with Mahomet , but since, through the Ambition, Pride, and Luxury of its Priests, so alter'd and disguis'd, by the introduction of an Idolatrous, Impertinent, Pompous way of Worship, that there is not so much left in it, as its true Name; for the Followers of it scorn to call it after its Founders Name, but distinguish it from their true Ancient Religion of Mahomet , by the name of Haly's Universal Religion. Those Innovations were the Cause that a select number of the true Mahometans , seeing so many Superstitious Ceremonies daily introduc'd into the outward worship, and so much Idolatry in the Essential part of their Religion, and every Age still adding new Inventions to that new superstructure, did withdraw themselves from those so gross and palpable Affronts which were daily offer'd unto the Deity, by taking from the Creator the Honour and Glory, which of all right and due doth only, and wholly appertain to him, to give to his Creature; and they worshipped their God by themselves, in Holiness of Life, and Purity of Doctrine, protesting against all those Innovations which had been foisted in, by the proud Priests of the Sect of Haly . For which, the Priests of Haly's Sect were not wanting in all their Arts, to cast dirt on the true Mahometans; they proclaim'd them Schismaticks, Hereticks, Doggs, and persecuted them in all places with Fire and Sword, declaring that they deserv'd a worse Usage yet, for having separated themselves from the Body of the Church; while they themselves were the persons that had distanc'd themselves, and fallen off from the true Mahometan Religion, by their prodigious addition of new Inventions, not becoming any sober, true Religion, while that those which they so much calumniated, were the true Observers of the Mahometan Religion, which they still follow'd, and had only separated themselves from the Innovations of the Halists , to avoid offering of those great Injuries to their God, which so Idolatrous a Guilt as the Halists did practice, would have oblig'd them to do. The Persians , who had more generally embraced the corrupt Sect of Haly than the Turks had, were more numerous and powerful than the true Mahometans, and their Emperors were such Zealous Maintainers of it, that, as their present Emperor has declar'd, they had design'd long since to root out of their Dominions the Mahometan Religion , but that the State Affairs would not till his time admit of so great a Change. But he being wholly govern'd by the most wicked order of Professors of the Sect of Haly , he follow'd their advice, and began by the murther of his own Subjects, of the true Mahometan Religion, that Universal Reduction to Haly's Sect, of all the true Mahometans , which he pretended to accomplish. In that he has outdone all his Predecessors, for they contented themselves with retrenching little by little, the Authority which Separatists (as they call'd the true Mahometans ) had obtain'd, together with the Priviledges and Liberty which they enjoy'd in their own Empire, and in sending into the Mahometan Empire swarms of Emmissaries of the Sect of Haly : especially of those from amongst them, which are the most Learned and most Wicked, and that amongst all the rest of the distinct Orders amongst the Priests of Haly , have as proudly as wrongfully assum'd the Title of the order of Mahomet , had thence call'd themselves Mahometists . Selim , the first Turkish Emperor of that Name, who had Married a Daughter of a Persian Emperor, of the Sect of Haly , did dreadfully feel the effects of the Divisions which those wicked Mahometists had sow'd amongst his People. For a certain sort of disaffected Men to the Government both in Church and State, under the pretence of Reformation in both, rais'd Arms and Rebell'd against their lawful Emperor, took him Prisoner, Murther'd him, and chose the Aga of the Janizaries to be their Protector, after they had caus'd the Sultana and her three Sons, Selim the Second, Amurat and Osman , to flye from their Cruelty into Persia . Where she attempted by the solicitation of the Mahometists , to have her Children (who had alwaies been brought up by Selim's particular Care in the Mahometan Religion, in which he himself had liv'd and dy'd) to be brought over to her own Perswasion, which being come to Selim the Second's Knowledge, he got from her his youngest Brother, which he secured under good hands, but she retain'd Amurat , which by that means was brought up in the Sect of Haly . After the Turks had liv'd some years under divers sorts of Governments, still finding themselves, as oft as they chang'd of Form of Government, after the Death of him they had chose Protector, in a worse condition than they were under the Reigns of their lawful Emperor, they recalled back Selim the Second from his Exile; he and his two Brothers were receiv'd by the whole Empire, with all the Expressions of Joy imaginable, he was seated on his Throne, Crown'd, and even Ador'd by his People. Of Truth, never was Prince, except his Father, Endow'd with so much Goodness and Mildness, mixt with Majesty and Greatness of Soul. He had not been long re-established in his Dominions, but that, through the sollicitation of his people, who earnestly desired to be govern'd by an Off-spring of so good a Prince, he Marryed a Foreign Princess, of the same temper of mind as himself, though an Halist , by whom he had no Issue. This was a great Misfortune to him, because that his natural, mild, and good disposition, did incline him infinitely to love Children, and the Conversation of the softer Sex, when he had a mind to unbend his thoughts, and give himself some Divertion from the business of State. Cha-abas , the then Emperor of Persia , who had fill'd Selim's Empire with all sorts of Orders of the Sect of Haly , especially of the Mahometists , who were like so many Spies in Selim's Court, was inform'd amongst the rest of Selim's Amorous Disposition, to which Inclination he gave the more scope, for want of Children by his Sultaness , to pass his time with. There was sent over to that purpose, a Persian Woman, indifferently handsome, of a mean Extraction, a great Zealot of the Sect of Haly ; with full instructions how to gain Selim's Affections, and when that was done, how to govern him, get from him a certain Knowledge of all the most private Consultations and Designs of the State, and to influence him in all his undertakings; she soon got so much the mastery over Selim's Heart, that through her means, all the secrets of the Port were known in Persia , according to which, Cha-abas , and his Mahometical Counsel, did take such measures, as did still tend towards accomplishing that great work, of extirpation of Heresie (as they stiled it) which had been so long contriving. It was thought that the quickest way would be, in getting Selim to forsake the Religion he was brought up in, and to bring him over to the Sect of Haly : very particular instructions were given to that purpose to his Persian Mistress, whom he lov'd the more, because she had brought him forth some Children, which were the Darlings of Selim's Heart. She together with others of that Faction in the Court, did use all their Indeavours to bring that great work about, and finding him so firm and stedfast to his Principles in Religion, as not in the least to yield to their Solicitations; Cha-Abas , with his wicked Counsel, thought it fit to remove him from the Throne, to make room for his Brother Amurat , who as you have already heard, was very zealous to the Sect of Haly , and did privately profess it. All things being fitted in Church and State for that great Change, upon which depended the entire and universal destruction, of the true Antient Orthodox Mahometan Religion, so long before design'd, and privately whisper'd about, and which could never be accomplish'd, till the Mahometan Religion, as it was particularly exercis'd in the Ottoman Empire, were first ruin'd. There was a design fram'd of Murthering the Sultan , of sending over a Persian Army, all of the Sect of Haly , of sending Commissions to all the Nobility, that were of the Sect of Haly in Selim's Empire, and in fine, of setting up Amurat to be Sultan , who should aid to bring in the Sect of Haly , and by his Power and Authority maintain it, and should declare himself of that Sect, and the Maintainer of it. The Storm was ready to break and fall upon the Ottoman Empire from Persia , when the Plot was discover'd, the Grand Council of the Divan being Summoned, they took the business into consideration, sifted it to the bottom, and found out all the contrivances, the Conspirators, and their Abettors; all those that could be seiz'd at Constantinople and elsewhere in the Empire, were put in Prison, Examin'd, Convicted by Authentick and undeniable Evidences, to be guilty of the Enterprise, which being against the Laws of the Empire, they suffered the Condign Punishment which the said Laws had order'd to be inflicted on such Notorious Criminals; after which, all the Priests of the Sect of Haly were seiz'd, that could be taken; and according to a Statute of the Empire, whereby they are declar'd Traytors, divers of them receiv'd the due Reward of such Villainous Enterprises, which they had made against the Sultan and the Empire, And all those in the Empire, of what degree and condition soever, that were of the Sect of Haly , were divested from all Publick Offices or Employes, incapacitated for the future, from having any Sway, or bearing any Offices either Civil or Military, banished from Court, and commanded to remain at twenty Miles distance from Constantinople , on great Penalties. Thus that great storm, which so severely threatned the whole destruction of the Ottoman Empire, was dispers'd, and the Empire reassum'd again its pristine Greatness, Quiet, and Natural Temper, all persons believing themselves safe and secure from any future Attempts of that Nature, by these safe and wholesome Laws, that Selim and his great Council did Enact upon this great Deliverance, amongst which they would have made one, that should have excluded from succeeding to the Throne, any Persons that should be of Haly's Sect, though they were in all other respects qualified, and known to be the undoubted Heir to the Empire. But Selim's tender Love and Affection to his Brother Amurat , would never permit him to give his consent to it, so that it was not done. Things were in this posture, when Roxana , of whom we are going to rehearse the Story, began to appear in the World, with all those Charms, which made her as many Slaves as she had of Spectators. She was Daughter to Aladin , the Seraquiere or Lord Lieutenant of a Province, a Person of a Noble Extraction, very Wealthy and Popular, and of the Sect of Haly: She was Endow'd by Nature with all the Perfections, which could accomplish a Person of about eighteen or nineteen years of Age, and she had receiv'd an Education proportionable to her Birth and Beauty. Her Father, who perfectly understood the ways of the Court, thought it his best course, in order to preserve his Fair Daughter from the censure of the World, to keep her as far as he could from Constantinople , and to dispose of her in Marriage to some Worthy Person, suitable to her Quality, and that great Portion which he design'd her. But his Wife, being of another mind, and very desirous to see the Court, did watch but for a time to go thither, and to bring her beautiful Daughter Roxana along with her. She was not long without a fair occasion for that purpose. Her Sister Marrying of her Daughter there, to a person who had a very considerable Employ at the Port. The earnest Invitation which they received from her Sister, to honour them with their presence, and some occasion which did call upon Aladin , to give his attendance at the Port about that time upon earnest business; made them to take hold of this Opportunity, so that they all came to Constantinople , where Aladin had a very stately Palace of his own. It was not long before Roxana's Beauty was blaz'd all about Constantinople , even within the Gates of the Seraglio ; amongst those who had had the happy Opportunity of seeing this Beauty, one who was the Son of a Bassa , and who had an House in another Street, whose Wall joined to the end of Aladin's Garden, was the most passionate of all her Lovers. He had contriv'd so cunningly, a hole in the Stone Wall, which answer'd to Aladin's Garden, that it could not be perceiv'd, it being so small in Aladin's Garden, and large enough in Ibrahim's Garden (so was the Lover call'd) to put his Head in so, that he could almost see all over that part of the Garden, that was next to that Walk. He had heard of Raxana's Beauty, which had made him desirous to see whether her Face did answer that Fame which was spread of her, and having learn'd that all the Air that she took, was in the Walks of her Garden, which was not overlook'd from any house, but her Fathers; and that neither himself, nor any body else had lived in his House, since the death of his Father, therefore he hoped to gratifie his earnest desires and curiosity. He wanted not of opportunity of seeing Roxana , for she delighting in Cultivating of Flowers, did Constantly towards the Cool of the Evening walk in the Garden, and look after her Plants; one day, a sudden shower of Rain falling, she was forc'd to retire into a little Summer House, where, sitting down, she began to entertain her self with her Woman, and the Subject of her discourse being the mariage at which she had lately assisted, she asked her Woman what she thought of the Bridegroom? who made answer, that she did think him very accomplish'd. To which, Roxana replyed , that for her part she could not affect him, and then began to speak of a man as she would like, and that she could Love. Her maid said, that such a man was not to be found in Nature ; to which she replyed again, that she would have such a one or none, and that she would stay till she found such a one . This discourse was clearly overheard by Ibrahim , who had then cause to admire her Wit, as well as her Beauty; of a truth he was so taken with both, that he resolved upon a Declaration of Love, which he thought ought first to be ushered in by asking of her Parents Consent, and immediately he set some of his Friends about it, but his Suit was so rejected by the Father, who design'd to marry her in his own Province, that Ibrahim thought it needless to apply himself any longer to her Parents, but resolved to endeavour the gaining of her Affections by all the means imaginable; but how to come to the speech of her, or by what means to convey his thoughts to her, was the business. After divers thoughts on that point, he thought it convenient to usher in his declaration by some pieces of Services, such as he should be capable of performing, and which he should think would please her best. He had not been above two or three days in Town since the death of his Father, which was above two years before, and having scarce been seen at Constantinople , he gave out to those few Friends which he had visited, that a business of importance which he was to accomplish, in the Country, and which had occasioned his coming to Constantinople , calling for him in haste back, he would be immediately gon again; after which, having taken leave of them, and gone with his People out of Town a little way, he sent them all to his Country House, under the care of his Steward, only retaining with him one Slave, who was his Gardner, in whom he had reposed very great Confidence. He had lain at a Friends House those two days he had been in Town, so that the Gates of his House having not at all been open'd, in the Night he return'd into the Town, where being come, he sent his Slave Moretto to get in such things as he should necessarily want, and to bring them to him the next Night at the deadest time of it, and that he should take a special care of not being seen, when he came into the House by the stable door. After having given these instructions to his Servant, who was an absolute Stranger in the City, he got privately into his House, and having found in the Garden house some Tools, he fell to work, in making a hole in the Garden Wall, through which he might Peep, and behold his invisible Mistress. It was through that Hole, that he had beheld her, and heard her speak; he observed how she ordered her Flowers and Plants, and once he heard her say to her Maid, they would do much better, if they were removed in the empty Bed, which was on the other side of the Garden, and that if they were Water'd early in the Morning, they would thrive much better; but that she and her Maid were both too lasie to rise so early, and that she would not trust the care of those Plants to any but her self, that when they were come to Perfection, they might owe the whole obligation of their being to her own hands and Care, and that she might take the greater delight in the use of them. This Ibrahim took upon himself, as if his Mistress had spoken particularly to him, he therefore takes the Resolution in the dead of the Night, to get over the Wall into her Garden, and there perform all that she had mentioned to her Servant, but because he thought the work might be too much for one pair of hands to perform in some few hours, he commanded Moretto to follow him. They got over the Wall, and the first thing they did, was to gather up every the least bit of Rubbish which might have dropp'd at their coming over, which put him in mind also to go towards the place where the hole was made, and examine how that stood, he found much Rubbish fallen there, but some Weeds growing high and thick in that place, as being somewhat out of the way, they did hide them: however, for fear of any discovery, when those Weeds should be cut down, he caus'd Moretto to gather them all up, and fill his Pockets with them, while he himself took care to hide the hole under a large Leaf, which he might easily at any time remove to the one side, with a little green Sprig. This done, they immediately fell to work, Moretto dug up the Roots, and brought them to Ibrahim , and he set them again in the other place; when they were all remov'd, he water'd them very well, out of a Cistern which was near the little Summer House, in which he had last seen Roxana ; while Moretto was employ'd in smoothing up the old Bed, and cleansing all places so well, that no foot-steps nor any other things might be seen out of order. They after that, got over the Wall again into Ibrahim's own Garden, and went to rest the remainder of the night. The Sultana having heard of Roxana's Beauty and Wit, she had a great desire to see her, wherefore she sent the next morning, to invite her and her mother to the Seraglio . This being such an honour as was not to be refus'd, they soon got Aladin's consent for their going thither; where they were very courteously receiv'd by the Sultana , who, finding Roxana's Beauty and Wit, beyond all that she had heard, did present her with very Rich Jewels, and was very unwilling to part with her so soon as that night, she was desiring their stay with her for two or three days longer, which they knew not well how to grant, because Aladin did expect them home that night, nor how to refuse the Sultana , who had been so liberal to them, and who had requir'd them to stay in so obliging terms, when that News were brought to the Sultana , that the Janisaries had taken up Arms, and were tumultuously assembled, to demand their Arrears, and the Heads of some of the great ones of the Divan ; that they were so outrageous, that it was not safe for any one to appear in the street, this presently caus'd Roxana and her Mother to consent to the Sultana's desires. So that they both remain'd in the Seraglio four days, at the end of which, the Janisaries having been appeas'd, with the Money which they had receiv'd for their Arrears, and a Months whole pay advance, provided they would lay down their Arms, and retire every one to their quarters, with assurance that those persons whose heads they demanded, should be strictly examin'd, and if found guilty in the least, their heads should go off, they all were dispers'd; and Roxana and her Mother, having thanked the Sultana for the honour she had made them, they return'd home well satisfyed. Roxana was no sooner return'd, but she made ready to go visit her Nurselings, she had taken the Key of that part of the Garden with her, which she usually kept in her pocket, and that unexpected delay from attending them, having made her think they were all destroy'd for want of watering, she hastned in great diligence with her Maid into the Garden; but how great was her surprisal, when comeing within sight of the bank or border that she had left the Flowers growing on, seeing nothing but the Mold, she presently concluded, that they had all been burnt up by the Sun, but coming nearer, she could not so much as perceive the least sign that any had lately grown there; and causing her Maid to dig for a Root, and finding none neither, it increas'd her wonder, so that she knew not what to think; but looking on her Maid, said she, by this very misfortune happened to all my Flowers, may be gathered, that we should never defer to another time what we can do at the present; had I remov'd my Flowers , continued she, in that shady bed against that other Wall, as I intended before the Sultana had sent for me, I might have found them all alive yet . All this was said as she was walking towards another part of the Garden; being come to the end of a quick-set, which took from her, till then, the sight of her regretted Flowers, of a suddain presenting themselves all fresh and flourishing to her Eye, it again did strike her into such an amazement, that she stood still, admiring, without speaking one word, which gave time to her Maid to say, Certainly, Madam, it was out of your mind that you had order'd some body to perform this Transplantation? Who, I? reply'd Roxana, and have the Key in my pocket, and not the least remembrance of giving such orders, nay, never having had the least inclination towards commanding any body about that work, but your assisting of me? in this place, where I am certain not a man nor woman have set their foot, but us two, since our coming hither; there is no such thing, continu'd she, besides these Flowers look not as if newly transplanted, they are all full blown, and hold up their heads, as if this had been their first natural bed, neither can I perceive one sign of any persons having been here, and if I should mistrust some body coming over the Wall, all those houses that abut on our Garden are empty. And who would have come over here, but with a design of robbing me, rather than of preserving of those things in which I take so much delight. Yet, Madam , said the Maid, something must be the matter, they cannot, at your single command or desire, have transplanted themselves. I know not what to say, nor what to think , reply'd Roxana; say nothing of the adventure, till I have examin'd every body in the house in particular, even my Father also. Come let us in . Of truth it was surprising to find all those Flowers to prosper so well upon their removal, but divers things did concur to it. First, the transplanting of them in the cool of the night, the quick dispatch of the work, the plentiful and continual watering of them, by our new Gardiner and his Man, and the supporting of those that droop'd at first, by soft and gentle props, which had been remov'd when they look'd up again, all which Ibrahim had done ever since their removal; for you must know, that he having not seen the next day Roxana as he us'd to do, (and he and his man by turns, had been incessantly on the watch) he had sent him out to know what was the matter; which having learnt from one of the Servants, and that no body had a Key to that furthest part of the Garden, but Roxana , who was very curious and laborious in bringing up of Flowers. Moretto did further of his own accord (being a good Gardiner of himself) inquire whether he might be admitted as Gardiner, to the Father, or to the Daughter, and promise having been made him of an inquiry into it, he had brought the News of Roxana's absence to his Master, who had taken the opportunity of Roxana's absence, to take a particular care of those Plants which he had remov'd, as the greatest Jewels his Mistress delighted in, and as Lovers use to fancy, by her special Command. He had likewise left upon the Table in the Summer House, whence he fancied to have receiv'd those orders, a paper of Verses, of which I here give you a Copy.  Our Mighty Prophet, cannot be alow'd With such Perfections to have been endow'd, As you would have the man you chuse to be, In fancy only such Heroes you'l see. Yet Mahomet was good, was great, was just, And in him our great Ala put his trust. But if his Soul was fill'd with mighty Jove , My heart is as brim full of mighty Love. In this I go beyond him, I love more, And you alone, Roxana , I adore. Roxana was to pass by that Summer-House returning, she cast her Eye that way, and perceived the Paper, which gave her the curiosity of stepping in, and taking of it up; she opened, and read it, and was no less surprized at that than she had been at the Flowers removal, which made her to hasten the more to the House to be better inform'd of those Mysteries, if she could possible; not without great reflection on the whole. Being got in, the first thing she did was to enquire of her Father whether he had employed any body since her absence to work in the Garden? He told her no, and that he had not seen any person appear in it besides the old Gardner, since her going to the Sultana's, though he had walk'd in it more than usually, since he had been detain'd at home by the Fanisaries Tumults, and that as far as he could see in her Nurcery over the Quick-set, he had not perceiv'd any body . She, after this answer made as strict an enquiry as she could possible of all the Servants and Slaves, one by one; threatning some, and making fair promises to others, if they would discover who had been in her Privy-Garden since three or four days; but all to no purpose, none could inform her; Whereupon she resolv'd to set a Watch for some nights, to surprize any person that should come over the Walls, and have them brought to examination. But all was to no effect. In the mean time, Ibrahim was not wanting in sending forth his Scout in the night, to learn how things were: Moretto was told that Roxana was sensible that during her absence, some body had got into her Garden, but which way she knew not, but upon suspicion that it could not be without the old Gardner's knowledge, though he could not be brought to confess any thing, she had caused her Father to turn him away, who had readily complyed with his Daughters desires in a business of that nature; that they were now in want of a Gardner, and if he would offer himself, and were expert at it, he might easily get the place, which was worth looking after. Moretto having had these Informations, desired the Fellow to propose him the next day for Gardner, which the other having promised to do, he returned to his Master, full freighted with all this good News. Ibrahim , who expected his return with the impatiency of a Lover, was glad to see him, and more too, when he heard all the story, and that there was not the least distrust from his House and Garden; but above all, when Moretto told him, that with his leave, if his Master thought he could do him any service in it, he believ'd that he could be taken as Gardiner into Roxana's Father's House, in the place of the old Gardner that had been displac'd, upon Roxana's Suspitions. I'll give thee leave, reply'd Ibrahim , and charge thee most strictly also, not to lose so good and great an Opportunity of serving me, which if thou dost honestly, I shall not only set thee free, but shall also prefer thee to some handsome Employment answerable to those great Services which thou shalt render me; but thou must first get me in all manner of provision for a Week, and then go and engage thy self to that Service, from which I expect such great advantages, as it may be contrived betwixt thee and me, but be thou sure still to engage industriously Roxana as she passes by thee in some discourse, upon thy particular skill in the raising of Flowers, that she may, if possible, have a fancy to thy Service, or at least to some of thy advice; and observe exactly all her actions and her words, that thou mayest give me a faithful account of them. Thus was Moretto sent to get in Provisions after which he went to learn of his Friend, what hopes he had of his getting him into that Family; It is your fault, if you get not in this very day , said the Friend, I have proposed the matter; it is hearkned unto, especially by Roxana, who has commanded me to bring you to her Father so soon as I saw you next, therefore come in with me, and I will shew you to our Master, who is now walking in the Garden . So said, so done; And Aladin did so well like of Moretto's person, promises of performance, and brisk answers, that he immediately sent for Roxana , and told her, he had met with a Gardner, who, he fancied to be more skilful than ordinary in his Art, wherefore he design'd to retain him, and that if she desired it, he should also have an Eye over her Garden. This did Moretto readily offer to do, pretending extraordinary skill, in the raising of Flowers from seeds; she answer'd, that she wanted no body for that work, but that having a design to remove some Flowers on the shady side of the Garden, seeing that those did so well that had been already remov'd there she knew not how, she would therefore employ him in stirring up the Earth, and fitting it for the Transplantation. Moretto was not wanting in presently informing them of the great Art he had in preparing of Earth, so that no Vermin nor Weeds should molest the Plants. After which Aladin and Roxana retir'd; and Moretto fell to work in the Garden. In the Evening, Moretto took the pretence of going to fetch some Linnen, that he might have the liberty of giving his Master an Account of his good Success; he told him all that had passed, and that he did not despair of finding opportunities to serve him to some good purpose. They took their measures accordingly, and that they might have a correspondency together without suspicion; they agreed upon this following expedient. Moretto could not write, but read very well his Master's Writing; Ibrahim therefore was to write what he desir'd to know; which he was to fasten to a stone, and this Stone he was to throw in Aladin's Garden, presently after he had made a certain noise, and which was to be answer'd by Moretto's striking upon his Spade, with the Instrument that he used to clean it with, which was the sign he was at hand to receive the Message; that Moretto having taken it up, and read the Contents, he should fling over a white Stone for the Affirmative, and a black stone when it was in the Negative. This Intreague went on very currant for three or four days, during which, Ibrahim did often see Roxana in her Garden; but one day Ibrahim having heard the Signal, and casting the Stone short, so that it fell on this side the Quick- set Hedge in Roxana's Garden, the door of it being shut, and not knowing which way to come at it, he at last sought so long, that he found in a Corner next to the Wall at the foot of the Quickset, a space which was more thin than the rest, he went to work about it, having first looked about whether the Coast was clear, and with his Knife having made himself a passage, which he industriously covered without and within, with the Branches which he had left to that purpose, he got into Roxana's Garden, took up the Stone, and could not forbear running hastily to the Hole in the Wall, to see whether he could see or speak with his Master; by good Fortune his Master was on the Watch, and hearing a noise he went to the peep-hole, where he saw his Moretto , who told him of the occasion of his coming, which was to advertise him that he should throw the Stones far enough, for fear that at some time or other he should be discover'd going to fetch them, through the hole he had made in the Quickset. Ibrahim had so many Questions to make to Moretto , that it kept him so long in the Garden, that he heard a noise at the entry of it. It was Roxana , who, sooner than her usual hour, was come with a design to take Moretto into her Garden with her, and shew him, what she would have him to do; he heard her speak to her Woman, and by the Voice, judged they were drawing nearer to the place where he was. Ibrahim did not know what to advise him to, he bidding him go hide himself in the Summerhouse, which Moretto would have done, but beginning to perceive their Cloaths, he could not recover that place without being discovered, at last being prest to it, he fell a digging, and minded them not. Roxana was wonderfully surpriz'd, when she first perceiv'd this new Gardner at work in her Garden, she came up to him, and asked him how he came there, and who had set him to work? he resolutely made answer, that finding the door open, and having heard her say, That she design'd to have the rest of her Flowers remov'd to that side of the Garden, he had taken the boldness to step in, and to shut the Door after him; and that when he was in, he could not forbear trying the goodness of the Earth with his Spade, that he might give her an account of it. The readiness of the Answer, and the boldness with which it was given, did incline Roxana to believe the Story to be true: wherefore having check'd her Maid for having not shut the Garden Door when they went last out of it; to which, the Maid protested, she thought she had; gave Moretto her Instructions. And then she went into the Summer-House, where Ibrahim , who was still upon the watch, did see her pull out a Paper, which she read very attentively; which done, Ibrahim heard her say, It is strange that I cannot learn who wrote this Paper, and by what means it was convey'd here? it speaks as if it came from one who knew my very thoughts. As if, Madam, the person had heard what you had spoken the day before, said the Maid, when you ask'd me my thoughts on the Bridegroom? Prithee what did I say , reply'd Roxana ? That you could not fancy such a Man, Madam, answer'd the Maid, and then, continu'd she , you gave such a Picture of an Hero, as scarce could ever be found in any Romance. I humbly conceive, Madam, that the Author of those Verses aims at that, when he says, that even our Great Prophet was not so qualified, as you require your Lover should be; and certainly, Madam, he that wrote those Lines had a world of Love, at least he expresses much of Passion, and if his other qualities answer that, though he should not be so perfectly accomplish'd in beauty and shape as you would desire; he doubtless might merit much. Hold, not so fast, reply'd Roxana, if you would not have me believe you had an hand in the conveyance of the Paper here, and are become his Advocate : If I were Madam, though I protest I am all Ignorance in this Mystery, reply'd the Maid, if his good Meen, his Birth, his Riches, his Courage cannot be question'd that dares lift up his thoughts to you; if, in a word all other things answer'd the Greatness of his Soul, would you be angry I should serve a Person that should express so much Love for you, Madam, whose happiness I wish for above my own. But what dost thou know, reply'd Roxana, but that he counterfeits, and that his Body is as counterfeited as his Mind ? But if otherwise, reply'd the Maid? well Madam, give me leave to wish for your Content, that he were as I fancy him, and that you could be satisfy'd of that with your own eyes. Thou speakest of impossibilities, reply'd Roxana, 'twas easie to have this Paper conveyed here, but a man cannot so easily convey himself; besides, it were beyond, what my Condition would permit me to allow of, without the highest resentment imaginable . Yet a Letter of Submission and of Love from such a person would not destroy you, Madam, reply'd the Maid. But how should I know still whether all the rest did answer to that Love, or whether that Love was not meerly pretended to make him sport withal? Then Madam, said the Maid, he would be the worst of men, and I should be sorry of ever having harbour'd one good thought of him in my Opinion. Well, to tell thee the truth, reply'd Roxana, such a Person I should be glad to see, if it did not cost me too dear . May you have your desires, Madam, reply'd the Maid, and I wish I conld have him inform'd of it. Not for the World, reply'd Roxana, I have a great fancy that he had an hand in the transplanting of my Flowers, though no mention is made of it in his Verses . I have had the same Thoughts, Madam, reply'd the Maid, for why should not he who knew your thoughts in one thing, know them in another also. Well, all that I can make of it, reply'd Roxana, is, I fear, that some of my Servants have been brib'd to let a Person into my Garden, who being closely conceal'd, did overhear all that I said and acted, according as his humour led him after it . Pray, Madam, give me leave to consult a Caldean about it, said the Maid, I know one that is very expert, and who has told me strange things concerning my self? Do what thou wilt, reply'd Roxana, but take it all upon thy self, I will have no hand in it . With that Roxana went out of the Summer-house, ordering Moretto to draw the door after him when he had done in the Garden. You may imagine in what rapture Ibrahim was at all he had seen and heard; he resolved to make good use of it, and to that purpose he did cast a little Stone over, towards the place where Moretto was at work; who did guess at the meaning of it, and having seen whether the Coast was clear, he drew near to the peep-hole, where Ibrahim told him all that had passed; after which, it was agreed that Moretto should ask leave to go to a Caldean which he had heard of, who us'd to inform him as to Gardening, to know of him when the Stars and the Moon were in the best disposition for to transplant those Flowers which Roxana had commanded him to remove; that that should be an introduction by which, through his Wit and good Management, he should insinuate to the Maid that she could not employ a more Learned Man than that Caldean , if she should give him the least hint of any desire she had that way; and if so, that then he himself would in a disguise pass for the Caldean , and by that means work his own ends to his full content. This being agreed upon, Moretto return'd to finish his work, and then he return'd into the House, while his Master retired to rest, and to expect his answer. Moretto , whose Wit answered the great inclination which he had to serve his Master, fail'd not of addressing himself to Roxana's Maid, to obtain leave of going out, as he had projected; and he told her so many wonderful things of this Caldean , that the Maid grew impatient of speaking with him her self, with a design that if he did not answer exactly the expectation which Moretto had stir'd up in her by his recital, she would pass him by, and go to her old acquaintance; and no sooner was Moretto gone, but that she acquainted Roxana with the wonders which Moretto had told her of his Caldean ; this set her as much a-gog as her Maid, of hearing what he could say, but for fear any body should have the least suspition of it, she ordered her Maid to entertain him from a low Window, and that she would be concealed in some convenient place of the room, where she might hear all. Mean time away gets Moretto in the dusk of the evening to his Master, with such accoutrements as were proper for to make an absolute Caldean of him, he sitted them upon him, gave him his Cue, and when it was dark they both got out at the Stable door, and away they trudg'd towards Aladin's House, which, though near, required many steps to get the right way unto it; being got thither, our new Caldean stood at a little distance from the House while Moretto went into give the Maid notice, who being upon the watch, bid him stay a little for an answer, and went towards her Ladies Appartment: This gave Moretto some thoughts that her Lady was to be made acquainted with it, in which he was presently confirmed; for after the Maid had told him at what Window he should bring the Caldean , he going out, turn'd back suddenly, to ask her if he should remain with the Caldean , or come in again, he had a glimps of Roxana who was getting into that low Room; he was bid to come in again, and leave the Caldean to discourse with her privately. Moretto presently inform'd Ibrahim of his new discovery; after which he brought him to the appointed Window, where he left him, and so went into the house, leaving his Master to manage those two Females. The Maid ask'd him, whether he was the Caldean of whom their Gardner had given so great a Character? he answer'd that he was the person, in a low voice; she bid him speak louder without fear, because there being No body else that could hear: no, said he, then I find you have a mind to play upon me, and seeing that you will not deal with me, as I design'd to deal with you both, added he, I'll retire immediately, and Roxana shall not have the satisfaction which she expected from me. At the word Roxana , both the Mistress and the Maid started, and perceiving that he was going to be as good as his word, by moving from the Window; Hold , said the Maid by Roxana's Command, and since nothing is hid from your great Knowledge, speak boldly to us both! Do, said Roxana , and if thou goest on as thou hast begun, I will highly gratifie thee. Then say not one word more, reply'd Ibrahim, for it were needless; I know your Thoughts, and as dark as it is can read them on your foreheads as easily as the Verses in your Pocket. Ask me no more questions, I say, continu'd he, no more than I ask you, but hear with attention all that I know of your Thoughts, your Wishes, and Desires. 'Twas by my great Art, my Infallible Art, that the Flowers in your Garden were Transplanted; I caused those Verses to be Wrote, which you found in the Summer-House, after you had given your Maid an account of the qualifications that man should have that you could Love. I infus'd into such a Person the desire to see you, to like you, and to give you that short declaration of Love in Verse: Ask me not why I did this for you, I see your longing desire to do it, not one word. I read also that you would be glad to see that so accomplish'd a Person, and foresee that you will love him, and that your hearts will agree. I know that your Servaut would have addressed her self to another of my Profession, but he had not given you all this satisfaction. I know your Parents will thwart his Love to you, and that it is not to be slackned by their greatest severity; and that you will, nay that you must, for the Heavens have Decreed it, I say, you must repay his Love with yours, mutually enterchange your hearts, and by firm Promise make you both one Person, 'till time and Friends work your Parents to give their consent. I know, lastly, that you would be glad to see the Person's Idea or Form , which you shall do; hear it speak, Court you, as if it were he himself, if you dare with only this your Maid, go to the Summer-House this night at Twelve, where I engage nothing shall appear, or be heard to affright you. And now I have done; when you would hear more, send for me here again, or I'll come of my self when I think you may want me: remember this night at Twelve, on which depends much of your future happiness . He was Retiring, when Roxana holding a Purse in her hand, cry'd hold, take this . At which turning his head, I despise your gilded dross , said he, and move by Nobler Motives . So he retir'd. It is scarce to be imagin'd, in what surprizal and confusion of thoughts our Caldean left his Mistress and her Maid by his pretended miraculous Skill, they took him for no less than a great Prophet; but the only scruple which was left in Roxana's thoughts was, why he had, by his own Confession, so much concern'd himself in the interest of a Person so absolute a stranger to him as she was? to which the Maid made answer, That though he was not pleas'd to discover his reasons for it, she might conclude, that if she knew not him, it was probable that he not only knew her, but had also some great Reasons that led him to act as he did: and pray, Madam, give me further leave , added she, to tell you, that I look not upon this Person as one of those ordinary men which we employ to tell us our Fortunes . Nor I neither, reply'd Roxana , I rather take him to be some Great Master in the Mathematicks, who by his great Reading, and profound Learning, joyned to some conversation with Christians, who it is said are incomparable in those fore-telling Arts, has attained to this wonderful heighth of Knowledge, as to read our very thoughts. And in that opinion, I have a great desire this night to try this prodigious experiment which he has said he would shew me. There Madam, I leave you, said the Maid, and must acknowledge my weakness, my fears and apprehensions, of I know not what danger, prevail too much upon me, to venture so far . Thy panick fears, reply'd Roxana , I have as much to hazard as you, and yet my desires are so great to see the shape of the Person he mention'd, that I will venture on the thing. Madam, I confess, that as you are of a greater Rank, you have more to lose than I, but then give me leave to tell you, that you have also more to gain; for if I mistake not, pardon my boldness, Madam, there is another Motive than bare curiosity that leads you on, while I have neither interest nor curiosity enough to venture . You cannot think it should be Love should push me on, reply'd Roxana , with a Person that I never yet did see? But, Madam, there may be Inclinations and Desires to see an Object so conformable to ones wishes, as our great Man has promis'd to shew you , said the Maid. I must confess , reply'd Roxana, that nothing could please me more than to see such a Person as I have represented to my self divers times, and which I have never seen. Doubtless, Madam , said the Maid, and it would not be very difficult for you to love such a Person too. Thou com'st near to the point , reply'd Roxana; well, to encourage thee to attend me with thy endeavours, I will confess to thee that I have had some inclination towards that Person who writ the Verses which I found in the Summer-house, ever since I first read them; and that then, and divers times since, I have wish'd that that Person were qualify'd according to my desire. Be sure to keep my Secret, now that I have made thee my Confident. This is to engage you further , added she, giving her the Purse which our Magician had refus'd, take it as an assurance of my further Favours, which I will always measure by those Services that you will render me . There needed no more to engage her Maid wholly to her devotion; she protested that she would go through Fire and Water, and pass over the greatest difficulties imaginable: that she was not only ready to attend her that night, but also to lay down her life at any time for her Service: Thus they having spun the time away till the hour of Ten. Roxana laid her self in a Day-Bed, which was in an open Room, joyning the Gardens, more to rave on the Adventure she was going about, than to sleep; while she left her Maid watching, with strict charge to call upon her at the appointed Hour; she having such an ascendant over her Mother, and now that Aladin was still absent, as he had been for two days before, she dispos'd of her self and Servants as she pleas'd; which was the reason that she had pretended that to enjoy the cool Air which came from the Garden into that Room she had chosen to lye there that night. If Roxana busied her thoughts one way, Ibrahim was not more quiet in another, He hugg'd himself a thousand times for carrying on his Design so well, and without the least suspicion; he thank'd his propitious Stars as oft, and wish'd that he might but converse for some few moments with his Moretto , to take further measures to finish the so well begun Work: He was weighing every particular circumstance; his Fears and Hopes were ebbing and flowing according as his thoughts did suggest him, when Moretto , who through his hole in the Quickset had got into the Garden, so soon as he had seen the Coast clear, did cast some Stones over into his Master's Garden, to give him notice of his being at the hole. Ibrahim , whose solicitous thoughts did not hinder him from being attentive that way, presently repair'd to the place; where, hearing that it was Moretto , he cast the Rope-ladder over the Wall, and bid him come over to him. There he told him what he had done, and in what an amazement he had left both Mistress and Maid; what he had promis'd them to perform that night at Twelve, and what he design'd further to act. But, my dear Moretto , continu'd he, dost thou think that Roxana will have so much Curiosity and Courage as to adventure her self at the Place? Sir , reply'd Moretto, if the Character you have given her of your own Person has touch'd her Heart, you may be sure that she will pass over all dangers to see so charming an Object; and that she had some propensity that way, is clear , by her desire to be present at the Caldean's Discourse. However , reply'd Ibrahim, I will prepare my self for that purpose, in which I must have thy assistance to carry all off without the least suspicion . Then he told him how he had laid the Plot, what part he was to act, and that he would perform the rest; he bid him put on that Caldean Habit which he had worn, to disguise himself; that he should hide himself behind the Bushes which surrounded the Summer-House, so that he might see when they were got into the House, that then he should pull the door close by a String ty'd to the Lock, and keep it shut on the out-side, till he should hear him to dismiss them, and then he should let loose the door, slip off the string, and get as fast as he could into the out-houses where he usually lay. Ibrahim having made an end of informing Moretto how he should act, he gave him some Lamps to set up in divers places of the Summer-house, with order to watch their coming, and to sling a Stone for Signal of their approach; after which Moretto got over the Wall in his Caldean Habit, dispos'd of the Lamps, fastn'd the String to the Lock of the Door, and went to watch their coming. Roxana in the mean time being too full of imaginations to get a moments sleep, began to talk to her Maid, which was over-heard by Moretto , as he was got to the outward Quickset, which parted Roxana's Garden from her Fathers; this made him Curious to lend an ear to those Voices, but what with their speaking too low for fear of being over-heard in the House, and with the distance he was at, he could not understand what they said, so that he did not know who those persons were; but he was soon inform'd of that, for Roxana having a mind to try her own Courage as well as her Maids, in going into her Father's Garden before hand, (for then it was but half an hour after Eleven) she had ventur'd out, and they were walking towards the Quickset partition, on the other end of it that Moretto's Creeping hole was so that he could distinctly hear the Maid say, Madam, I know not what I ail, but a certain horrour seizes me on the sudden, which makes me fancy I see strange things about me . Thou art able, reply'd Roxana , to produce fear in the most resolute, with thy strange fancies; and thy talk so works upon my imagination, that methinks I see strange things also; I find we are both very unfit for so great an Enterprise, continu'd she, and seeing thou hast not the Courage to hearten me up, I'll think of a timely retreat, and desist from this attempt, at least for this night. With this she turn'd back to go towards the House, still discoursing with the Maid. Moretto , who had heard this, thought he had enough, and having the Caldean's disguise upon him, did resolve to break their new measures; to that purpose he crept all along a Hedge which hid him from their sight, in order to intercept their return, and to fright them into a compliance to his Master's designs: but as he was making all the haste he could, he made a noise; which conduc'd to his designs, for Roxana hearing it, and as fear augments all Objects, so it increases Sounds, she imagin'd it to be much nearer to her than really it was, which made her and her Maid remain moveless in the place where they were. This gave time to Moretto to recover himself, and to get before them unseen into the Room, where he found the Door open, not doubting but that they came from thence; where he design'd to stand, and to affright them back again towards the Garden. After that Roxana had stood listning a while, and heard no more noise, she began to whisper to her Maid, that she wish'd her self in the House again . To which the Maid answer'd, that it was her thoughts also; and added, pray Madam let us get in so soon as we can; this she said, creeping softly after her Mistress, that mov'd as slow as she could; they got at last to the door of the Room, where the Maid, being more frighted than the Mistress, would have run in first. But what a horrour was she in, when she found the passage possest by the Caldean , which she knew by his Habit, with that small light of the Stars which they had. She presently run back, giving a shriek, which made Roxana do the like; but striking violently one against another it broke the violence of it; so that it being in the deepest silence of the night, and far from the body of the House, by good fortune it was not heard. But what with the fear and the shock they had given one another they both had fallen, the Maid in a swoon, and Roxana not far from it. This put Moretto into greater trouble than before, he knew the hour was near, that his Master was in expectation of them, but how to get them thither he knew not; he found that Roxana mov'd, which made him to tell her, That she should not fear any thing so long as he was by her; that so soon as he did foresee her fears coming upon her, and that she design'd to retire, and not give her self the satisfaction of seeing that which she most desired, and on which depended all her future misery or happiness, he had Transported himself to her aid, to strengthen her confidence, and to be her Protector; That he very much feared some evil would befall her Lover or her self for the want of Faith, and that if she would not bring her own or the Persons ruine upon him, which she was to have seen, she ought to go on boldly, being assured that under his conduct, she and her Maid would both remain secure from all manner of dangers . All this he said, feigning his voice, pretending to speak softly for fear of being over- heard; but his design was to disguise his voice that they should not perceive the change was put upon them. They had never heard him speak but once before, and had not seen his face till then, because that at the Window, the Street being lower than the Room Roxana was in, they could not well see his face, so that he pass'd for currant for the same person in both their Opinions; I say in both their Opinions, because that by this time the Maid was recovered out of her Trance, and had lain still and heard part of what Moretto had said to Roxana , and was sitting on the ground at her Mistresses feet, whom Moretto had raised up. Roxana being somewhat comforted, assured, and affrighted by the danger she or her Lover would be in, if she still persisted in refusing to go, told the Caldean, that if he would accompany her, she would under his protection adventure on . He having again spoken all he could to encourage them both, with assurance of his protection, Roxana gave him the Key to open the door of her Garden, and he led them both towards it. He was still in a peck of troubles for want of an opportunity of giving Ibrahim the sign of their approaches, that the Lamps might be lighted. And Roxana had more than once complain'd of the darkness, which she confess'd increas'd her fears; and to assure her, he had told her that he would order lights sufficiently by that time they got there. I have but to speak a word, give a sign to my Spirits, or cast a stone, and they will soon obey my will; you shall see the Experiment of it, continu'd he, so stooping he took up a stone, and flung it towards the Summer- House; now, said he, observe how the place will be enlightned to your desire . They had not gone two steps further, but they began to perceive a Light in the Summer-House, which still encreased, as they drew near. Moretto did entertain them as well as he could, with assurances of safety, to take off all their fears; at last coming towards the Summer-House, he rais'd his voice on purpose, that his Master should not be surpriz'd at his coming with them, and said, Now, Madam, is the time for you to banish from you all fears, and to fill your heart with Love, for I have done for you more than I promised; I only told you I would bring that Person's Idea to your presence, who wrote the Verses, but there is something which must still remain secret, which makes me think I can never do too much for you, wherefore I have transmitted the Person himself here; he was in his sleep when I did it, but I suppose by this awakned, or will soon awaken at your coming. Moretto being now come to the steps that went to the Summer-House door, Ascend, Madam, continued he, and then admire what I have done for you . With that, he led her up, and put her into the house, then took the Maid who follow'd her Mistress, and put her in also, and bid them go forward to the Table . As re- assur'd as Roxana was, she durst not contradict her Guide, which gave him time to shut the door upon them, and to retire. Roxana was wondering at the great and clear light which so many Lamps as were placed there did give; when that Ibrahim , as if newly awakned, being set off with the most advantageous Dress that he could possible put on, and adorn'd with a world of Jewels, did raise himself from a Day-Bed, on which he was lying, and, as if amaz'd, startling and staring. Is it a Dream, or do I wake ? said he; then looking about him, Where am I? continu'd he. Then looking on Roxana, Ha! What do I see? the very Darling of my Soul, my Heart's Delight, and all that I most desired. What good Angel has been so kind as to continue and conclude my Dream with such a blessed Vision! Roxana, Divine Roxana here, and I stand still, and not cast at her feet a Heart that is so wholly hers! Pardon, sweet Angel, the Errour that the great surprisal I am in, at so fair a Vision, has caus'd me to commit; and deign to accept the offers of an Heart whose greatest Glory is to be your Slave . With that he was going to throw himself at Roxana's feet, when she moving her Body that way, But hold , said he again, to himself, let not my excess of Joy render me too rash, and lose the Blessing I enjoy in this bright Apparition, by drawing too near with my Terrestrial Body: then falling back again, while he was speaking this, thus he continu'd; If you are not but condens'd Air, or some Etherial Spirit, who to mock my Passion for a time, has assum'd this glorious shape to render me afterwards the most miserable wretch living, when you again dissolve into soft Air. Speak, give me some signs of Life; a Voice coming from so admirable a Shape, cannot but be all Harmony to my Heart . At this Roxana bowing forward, was going to speak, when he again interrupted her thus; By Heavens, it moves! but one word, and I am blessed for ever . Then did Roxana say, Whoe're you are, that thus exercise your Wit and Fancy upon a Person who knows her self much inferiour to what the extasy you seem to be in leads you to speak; know that I am the real Roxana, Mistress of this place. If all I hear and see is not Inchantments, which I am apt to believe is, when I consider that Shape which is before me, and those Expressions, which, whether true or feigned, real or delusive, please my Ears and Heart? and if you are as real Substance as I find my self to be, I may now say I have seen the reality of those things which I before did only frame in my imagination; and since I find that all which that Great man has told me proves true, even beyond my expectation, I am apt to believe that all the rest he has told me will be of the same stamp . If he has said, Madam, reply'd Ibrahim , that you should see a Person, in whose single heart there was more Love contain'd for you, than in all the World besides, (though all were too little yet.) If that he told you, that it was impossible for that person to live a day longer after seeing you, without the hopes that you would accept of an Heart which is wholly yours. If he has assur'd you that from the first moment that person beheld you, he vow'd to live eternally yours: I am the person. In confirmation of which, I here lay my life, and all I can call mine at your feet; protesting by our great Prophet, that I will never rise again from this place, till you are pleas'd to accept and receive this free (though unworthy) Gift I make you of my self. Saying this, he slung himself at Roxana's feet; she extended her hand to raise him, but he taking hold of it, and pressing it hard with his lips, No, Madam , continu'd he, never must I rise from this place, till you have spoke my happiness . To which thus Roxana answer'd, That I may the sooner relieve you from this unbeseeming and uneasie posture, and to follow what the Heavens have decreed, in which peradventure concurs something of my own inclination; for I cannot but think, when I reflect on all that has been acted this night, that it is the will of Heaven. Here is my Hand that I receive those offers you have made me of your Heart, in exchange of which, I give you another, that was never any others but mine, and now yours. And I, Madam , reply'd Ibrahim, do take the boldness to seal this Contract on this white Author of my Happiness with my Lips . With this she took him up; then said to him, looking on her Maid, Here is one shall be a secret Witness of our secret Love, till we find means to get our Friends consents; mean time, you know my Father's severity towards me, by which you may guess that if he had been now at Constantinople, I should not have had this opportunity, which I know not when we shall have again , because he is expected here again to morrow . After this they fell to particular discourses about the means they should use to see one another; and they agreed that Moretto , for having been so instrumental to their mutual happiness, in bringing them to the knowledge of the Caldean , should be admitted into the Confidence, not doubting but that betwixt him and her Maid they should have such frequent news of one another, that they should not be long before they met again; upon which, and divers other discourses of that nature, day beginning to break forth, they thought fit to separate, which, after a thousand repeated assurances, of constancy on both sides, they did; he leading first Roxana to the Gate of her Garden, then he getting over the Wall by his Rope-ladder. The brightest Day is frequently follow'd with a stormy Night, and the fairest Night succeeded by a Cloudy Day. Our Lovers Joys, like all vehement Motions, were too great to last long, and though the Cause of it was not in themselves, but from abroad; yet so suddain, so great, and so passionate a Love, as was between them, rendred them not long happy, as you shall hear from what follows. Ibrahim was a Person, that in all respects was very desirable; no wonder then if that Roxana was so impatient to see again a Person so like that which she had fram'd in her imagination, that could only please her. She had employ'd her Maid, and the Maid Moretto , so that she was certain that her Father would not return the day following to Constantinople. Ibrahim was to be advertis'd of that, and means contriv'd of getting to the Summer-House, the only convenient place for their private interview; Moretto was to be consulted upon this, wherefore, when Roxana knew that he was at work, she took the opportunity to speak to him, as she went to visit her Flowers towards the Evening, and told him, That she did not know how Ibrahim could get into the Summer house that night; as he had been the night before? Why, Madam, the same way, reply'd Moretto. We have no longer any need of the Caldean's assistance , said Roxana, and I would gladly converse with him, after his own coming to this place. Moretto . finding that he had like to have committed an error, said, Madam, though he was last night carried into the Summer House, while he was asleep, by the Caldean's wonderful Power and Art, yet I suppose that he convey'd him there through the Air over those Walls which encompass your Garden; and no question, Madam, but that if I inform him, by your Order, of your desires, let me but know the hour, and his Love will be sufficient to find him Wings to flye to you, if all other means were failing, he'll find or make a way over the Walls, no question. Well, said Roxana, I leave that care to you, fail not to give him timely notice of it; but , added she, where will you find him? we forgot that. Trouble not your self, Madam , reply'd Moretto, the Caldean will soon satisfie me in that. 'Tis true , reply'd Roxana, but after you have got that knowledge hasten to him, and deliver him this Note : Then she gave him the Note, and went to walk in her Garden as she us'd to do; but being come near the Summer-house, she had not the power to advance one step forward till she had gone into it; where being seated, she began to reflect on all that had happen'd to her there the last night: a while after, she pull'd Ibrahim's Verses out of her bosom, and having kiss'd them, she read them over, kiss'd them, and put them into her bosom again; then fell a raving as before; and then by and by again, out would she pull the Paper, kiss, read, and kiss it again; and this sport she repeated over divers times. All this while Ibrahim , through his peep-hole, had the pleasure of seeing how much his beloved Mistress did make of his Verses; for he had seen them so often that he could discern them at such a distance. This sight did infinitely please him, and he was so attentive at it, that he perceiv'd not Moretto , who was coming to him, 'till he was close by, he acquainted him with Roxana's desires, then gave him the Letter, which being opened by Ibrahim , he read in it what follows.  You'll wonder it may be at my forwardness, in making these advances, which I should, with the Decorum of my Sex, have expected first from you, but mighty Love causing me to reflect on all that the Heavens have done for me of late, I can no longer withstand his invincible Power, it is he that has guided my Pen, to inform you that my Father not returning home this day, this night may be as freely ours as was the last. Heaven knows what we shall do to continue our enterview after Aladin's return; but I leave all to Love, to whom I have wholly devoted my self. I will not doubt but that you will be as desirous to meet me in the Summer-house this night, at the same hour, as I shall be to see you there. It is Roxana gives you this advice.  It was now Ibrahim's turn to kiss the Letter, which he did over and over, and having bid Moretto to fetch him Ink and Paper, he pass'd his time till his return, in contemplating his Dear Roxana , who by this time was fallen asleep, holding the Verses in her hand, which were ready to drop. To enjoy the better the benefit of the cool Air, she had cast aside her Vail more than usually, by which he did discover whole mines of Beauties which were spread all over her neck and Breasts. When Moretto was return'd, he could not take off his Eyes, from so Charming an Object, and when he did it, he enviously turned his back towards the Hole, that Moretto should not rob him with his Eyes, of some part of that which he thought was wholly due unto his Love. In this place, as in many others of this Book, I might make divers curious Reflections; as here, for example, jealousie is the natural effect of Love, &c. But my design being to give you only a bare account of the Court-Secret, according to the faithfulness of my Memoires; besides that, the Subject of this Novel is sufficient enough of it self to furnish me with matter, I shall decline all such kind of superfluous digressions, and stick close to my Subject. This is then what Ibrahim writ back to Roxana .  Our Love had a more noble birth, than to ascribe unto it any of those low Formalities, which were invented by meaner Souls than my Roxana's , and that are put in use by such persons as make Love more by form than by inclination. Let it suffice, that your kind invitation is as acceptable to me, as if it was an assurance that you gave your consent to answer one from me. I shall employ all the time, till the happy hour be come, in such pleasant Reflections on what has already pass'd, and in such Raptures on the Joys to come, that I shall, by those means, make that time, which otherwise would seem an Age to me, be but a moment of pleasure, till that happy hour. The Heavens, who has made me for my Roxana , and she for her Ibrahim , preserve us both.  This Letter being finished, he dispatched Moretto away with more than usual haste, only that he might lose no more of that sight which his sleeping Roxana did afford him. He was still gazing on, wishing himself all turn'd into Eyes, that he might devour her with looking on, when on a sudden a great noise was heard, of a confusion of Voices, which still drawing nearer to his Garden, he thought fit to retire into his House, for fear of a surprize. When he was got thither, he more distinctly heard the Voices, and gathered by them, that it was a Slave who had made his escape. Some of the Pursuers were for getting over the Wall, and to search in the Garden; others again said that no body liv'd in that house; the sooner for that, cryed others, let us search there; at last the most voices carried it, for the search in the Garden: Some presently got over by the help of others, at which Ibrahim having made fast all his doors, he kept within, and let them do what they pleased without, when, after they had looked all over, and found no body, they left off, but it was not without some cunning observations, made by one of those that came first over; he, before the rest was come, had observed some footsteps new made upon the Grass which was high, and those steps tending towards the House, he had follow'd them, and leaning his Ear to the Key-hole of the door, he had heard some kind of treading in the House, all this gave him some Jealousie, that the Fugitive was gotten into it; he made no more noise of it at that time, but was resolved to watch thereabouts that night, to seize on the Fugitive himself, when he should think of getting off, and have the sole Honour and Reward of the business to himself; with these thoughts he mixt himself with the rest of the Rabble, and got over the Wall as he had got in, and the noise going by little and little, further and further, at last all was quiet as before. So soon as the Storm was over, Ibrahim could no longer refrain from going again to have another view of his Mistress asleep; but when he came he found her gone, 'tis likely being awakned by the noise. Ibrahim guessing that he had lost his happiness by the noise which the multitude had made, did wish that he had had some of them there to revenge himself upon; but presently considering that that night he should have the happiness to see her nearer at hand, and to discourse with her, he quieted himself with that Expectation, and return'd into the house to wait till the good hour. Mean time, Roxana on her part did not think the time less long, though she had slept some part of it away. She had receiv'd Ibrahim's answer by Moretto , and she was so ordering of things, and disposing of the Servants, that none but her own Maid and Moretto , the two Confidents, should know of the business: All things being put in order, and the hour drawing near, she thought it would be some satisfaction to her, to spend the rest of the time at the Summer House, which she did, taking her Maid along with her, and leaving Moretto at her Garden door, to be in readiness to give them the Alarm, if any Enemy should appear. At last the twelve a Clock at night Prayers were proclaim'd from the top of a Tower, according to the custom of that Country, where they have no publick Clocks, nor Bells; and Ibrahim came to the Garden with his Rope-Ladder, he presently fix'd it, and got up, and was striding over the wall, when a piece was discharg'd, which shot him quite through the Body, so that he fell head- long into Roxana's Garden. He that had shot him, followed close his Game, not knowing which way he had fallen, and believing that he had shot him, and not finding him on that side of the wall, cryed out, if there be any body in the next Garden, stop that Fugitive which I have shot; and looking for some convenient place to get over, he at last found the Rope-Ladder, on which having got, he leapt into Roxana's Garden, and was still so attentive after his pursute, that he consider'd not the persons that were by, but glorying in his Prowess, 'twas I kill'd him , said he: Moretto , who was come, and had seen what had happen'd to his poor Master, was in such a rage at this Villains Insolence, that with a Spade he had in his hand, he cleav'd the fellow's head in two, and laid him sprawling on the ground. You may imagine in what a condition Roxana was, who, so soon as she had heard the Gun go off, and the person fall, imagining it could be none other than her Ibrahim , she had run to him, and being stunn'd by his fall, she had concluded him dead, considering the great effusion of Blood which came from him; she presently sent her Maid to call the Servants of the house up, and to send them for help; she tore her Hair, endeavour'd to stop his wounds with the Linnen which she rent off her self; she rais'd his head in her lap, call'd upon him to speak to her, and finding no answer come from him, and that he was without motion, she fell backwards with her head against the Wall, in a swoon. In this condition were they both found by the Servants, the Assistance which had been sent for, and by her own Mother, who had been told of the sad disaster, by some over- diligent Servant, that had brought her thither. The Surgeons, moving of his body to search his wounds, saw a great deal of Blood on Roxana , which had run from him, and they not knowing of the business any more than they saw, did judge her hurt also, and by the place where the blood was, that she was mortally wounded. They stirring of Ibrahim's body, he came to life again, open'd his Eyes, turn'd his head about, and presently ask'd where Roxana was, and whether she was safe? He was answer'd, that there she lay by him dead, as they suppos'd; Then is all your assistance in vain , said he, I cannot live, if she be not, open my wounds afresh, or I'le tear them open with my own hands , continu'd he. Roxana's Mother by this was run to her Daughter, and with rubbing of her, and giving her some Cordials, she was brought to her self again. The first thing she did, as if they had conserted together, was to turn her head about, and then to ask where Ibrahim was? Here, Madam , said, one. Ay and dead , said she! then farewel life, I can no longer live, if he is dead . With that she flung her self back, and was returning into a swooning fit, but that divers cry'd out aloud, Ibrahim is not dead, he lives. Yes, Madam , said Ibrahim, long enough to tell you that I dye yours, as I design'd ever to have liv'd. Then do I breathe again , said Roxana . At last the wound being search'd, the Surgeons were ask'd what judgment they gave of it, whether Mortal or not? They with down looks, and sorrowful countenances, answer'd, there was no hope of life. At which words, Roxana crying out aloud, then farewel Ibrahim, I'le go before: she fell into a greater swoon than before, in which she was carryed by Servants unto her Apartment, and laid in her bed Ibrahim was also carryed to the house of one of his Friends, that he might have better Attendance, where after he had languish'd two days, he dyed, crying continually on Roxana , his dear Roxana ; and Moretto was struck with so much sorrow at the loss of so good a Master, that he stabb'd himself, and dyed at his Master's beds feet. As for Roxana , she continu'd so long in her fainting, that every body near her thought her to be dead; and when she came to her self again, it was with such extravagancies, such unjointed discourses, and such sudden flyings out, that it was easie to perceive her grief was greater than she could bear. Her Maid was had into examination, who having confess'd all, was at last dismist, and put away from her Mistress's service; they would have confronted her with Moretto and the Caldean , but the first being dead, by which means the last was not to be found, the business termin'd there. The body of that Wretch who had committed the Murder was found to be the Person who had watch'd for the Fugitive; he was deliver'd to his Friends, who came to demand him: Another person was plac'd near Roxana , on the account she might administer Comforts to her as well as other Services during her distraction; she was Sister to a Mufti, whose name was Repset , and hers was Zora : This Mufti did also frequently visit Roxana during her sorrow, in order to reduce her to her self again. But enough of that at present; we shall have occasion more than once to speak of this Mufti and his Sister, till then I leave giving you a Character of them: mean time, leaving Roxana to the care of those persons that were appointed by her Father and Mother to attend her, we will now come to the continuance of the Historical part of this Novel, till we have occasion to return to Roxana , and bring her again in play. Cha Abbas the Persian Emperour, perceiving that things did not go on as he would have them, towards the entire destruction of the Mahometan Religion, on which depended his Conquest of the Ottoman Empire, at which he aim'd, under the pretence of pure Zeal to his Religion; and that not withstanding all his Efforts, the formidable number of Priests of his sort, which he had sent to be like so many Spies in the very heart of that Empire, the great number of Pensioners which he kept amongst Selim's Courtiers and Chief Ministers of State, and the vast expences he had been at to defray all those Charges, he resolv'd to play quit or double. Selim's Pulse was once again to be felt, how he stood affected; and perceiving that it still beat true to the Mahometan Religion, in a great Council which was held at Ispahan , in which the Mahometists did rule the Rost, it was order'd and concluded that seeing no good was to be done by Selim , he should certainly be laid aside; whether there was any foul play shew'd to him after this, my Memoirs therein fall short, but it is certain he liv'd not long after that resolution was taken; he dyed in a manner suddenly, not without great suspition, that there had been given him some strong ingredient, which came from Persia , which had been mixed with his Coffee, or with those Herbs which he delighted frequently to smell to. His death surpriz'd all the world, but those that were of the Cabal, and made way for his undoubted Successour Amurat to mount on the Throne. After the Ceremonies of his Coronation were over, and that he was firmly Establish'd, he openly declar'd himself of the Sect of Haly ; but did promise that he would preserve the Laws of the Empire, and the Ottoman Religion according as it was Establish'd, and as his late Brother Selim had left them. Of Truth, Amurat of himself had very good inclinations, he was very Just, Pious, Religious, Charitable, and desirous to oblige all persons, that came near him, and had he been left to his own Will and Pleasure, he had doubtless Govern'd the Empire with all Peaceableness, Tranquility and Justice, to the great joy and content of his people. But what will not a blind Zeal do, which is continually fomented by such as breathe nothing but ruine and destruction! It was now high time for Cha-Abbas and all his Creatures, to put the last hand to the great work; to this purpose, all the Priests of Haly's Sect, which were about the Emperor, were charg'd never to let him rest, till they had brought him to a firm resolution, of changing the Religion of the Empire, by totally rooting out and expelling from it, the Ottoman Religion, and establishing in lieu of it, the Sect of Haly: This peal was daily rung in Amurat's Ears, proclaiming that the Heavens having made choice of him, to be the great and wonderful instrument of so good, so great, and so pious a work, by which he should avoid all expurgatory punishments for his sins, and should be immediately carried up by Angels, and laid at the feet of the great Ala , who should seat him in a Throne of Glory near unto himself; that he would leave behind him here on Earth a Name and Fame that should endure for ever, that his Memory would ever be in good Odour to all good persons, and that he should be here worshipped as a Saint, with many other such like assurances of honour and Glory, did at last prevail with him. This was the daily practice of the Mahometists, but they finding that though through their incessant plying of Amurat , all the day long, they brought him to their Bow, yet every morning, he would, after consulting with his Pillow, still continue in the goodness of his natural disposition, so that he alwaies appeared cold in the morning in the promoting of their designs, how warm soever they had left him the night before. They had recourse to another Stratagem, the same promises of greatness and glory in this world, and the next, which they had promised to him, they also assur'd to the Sultana , that she should enjoy in ample manner, if she did but plye Amurat at night, when they were in bed together, as they did all the day long, telling her on the other hand, that if she was slack or remiss in it, she would not only lose all those Honours, that Happiness and bliss which was prepared for her, but incur by her neglect eternal Misery. To what height will not a blind Zeal be screw'd up, by such fair promises on the one hand, and the terror of such dreadful punishments on the other! No wonder then, if that the Sultana's good, mild, and affable disposition, which she had alwaies shewn before she was Empress, did change into a morose temper, and into a most violent aversion against all those that were not of Haly's Sect: She assur'd Haly's Priests, that she should not lose all those glories, which had been promised her, by any neglect in the performance of what was required of her: Of truth, she so ply'd Amurat by night, and the Halists by day, that the worst of his Subjects or Slaves, was happy in comparison to him; at bed, at Table, at Council, at his Recreations, and Divertions, nay even at his Devotion, and greatest Retirements, he was so perpetually haunted and bated by those Wolves in Sheeps cloathings, that he divers times wish'd himself in the same Station that he had formerly been, provided he might but enjoy also that tranquility of Mind and Spirit which he then possess'd. Who could resist, to so many redoubled, nay rather to such a continu'd assault? For his own ease and quiet, and that he might but enjoy that content and quiet, which the meanest of his Servants possess'd, he was forc'd to yield to the Halist's perpetual solicitations, he promis'd to do all that they would, and to root out of his Dominions the Mahometan Religion, to establish in lieu of it, therein, the Sect of Haly , to change and alter the Laws which had been from time to time made against that Sect, and to make new Laws, or that he would dye in the attempt. From the moment that the Halist's had got that assurance from him, they gave him liberty to breathe again. Presently was Cha-Abbas acquainted with the good success of the Halists , and great joy was expressed at it through all Persia . But this was not all, there was still more to be done; they had got but one point yet, the present establishment of Haly's Sect, but how that should be secur'd for the future, was now the business in hand. New Orders were therefore sent from Persia , that the Priests of Haly should immediately enter upon that work, that a Successour of the same Sect should be procur'd, and secur'd, to supply Amurat's place after his Death, for fear of a relaps of the whole Empire, into the Religion of Mahomet again; and presently the whole Crew fell to work: Divers ways were propos'd, too long here to be repeated, my Memoires mention only two of the most eminent, which were most insisted upon. The first was, that the Bodies of Amurat and of his Sultana , should be so prepar'd and order'd by Medicines, as that the Sultana might bring forth a vigorous young Prince, to live, to be brought up in the Sect of Haly , and to be Successor to Amurat . All those means were us'd, but to no purpose; this stubborn refusal of Nature, not to comply with the desires of such persons, as use to overcome all obstacles, in lieu of teaching them that Ala was above all their designs, did but enrage them the more, and make them the more earnestly bent upon their wicked enterprises. A Successour was to be produc'd, that should be of the Sect of Haly , and that should step in betwixt the Heir apparent to the Ottoman Empire and it, because that the right Heir was of the Mahometan Religion, and consequently unfit for their purposes, wherefore no means were to be left unsought after, no ways untry'd, and no designs unattempted, that could conduce to the work in hand. They therefore concluded to try what Prayers, Pilgrimages, and Offerings would do. The thing was propos'd to the Emperor and the Sultana , and in short agreed upon, and the day prefix'd for the setting forth of the Court, that all things might be in a readiness against the appointed time, yet still delay'd from time to time by the Sultana and the Emperor's orders. Amongst the Priests of Haly was reckon'd in the first rank this Repset , which I have before mention'd, to be employ'd in administring of Consolations to the afflicted Roxana . Not that he was more Learned, or endowed with greater Gifts, or of a more Pious, Religious, and Sober Life than others, but that through his Crafty Insinuations, and Indefatigable Application and Attendance, he had got first the Sultana's good opinion, and by her means and recommendations, had rendred himself Master of his Master, the Emperour: He had his Ear as well as his Heart, so that he did order and dispose of all places of Authority and Trust: He was of all the Councils, even to the most secret and particular: In a word, he was become the Dominus fac totum . This acquired him a great Repute, Esteem, Respect, and even Fear; for those that had no occasion of his Services, did fear his Frowns, on which depended their Ruine, as their Establishment on his Smiles and Condescentions. This Creature, of mean, obscure Extraction, of as mean a mercenary Soul, and of vitiated Principles, in the Station he was got, was the Primum mobile , or great Wheel, which set the whole Machine of the Halists to work in the Ottoman Empire; he had access to the Emperour and to the Sultana at all times, at all hours of the day and night, even when they were in their privatest retirements: He had since his greatness at Court shaken off the Rags of Monasteries, and had lick'd himself from a shapeless Cub, into a spruce Courtier. The Court was then replenish'd with Ladies, whose Beauties might compare with those of all the other Courts in the World. But the Sultana did tarnish them all, and forc'd them tacitely to confess, that she alone eclipsed their Lustre. The Sultana had her Diversions amongst those Ladies which compos'd her Court; and their Beauties did attract to them from all parts of the Empire divers Adorers of the other Sex. But still our Mufti notwithstanding his multiplicity of Business elsewhere, would make one; he was always amongst the Ladies, and it was thought that those hours which he was to have employed in Private and Publick Prayers, and in other Devotions, he spent in his conversation with the Female Sex; being led thereunto by that most powerful Magnet , his natural inclination: He had not been satisfied with those private Stealths which he made on particular Persons Wives and Daughters, under the Authority and Power of his Function; but his Ambition and Lust still encreasing, as did his Fortune and Credit, he resolved to look higher, and to attempt the highest piece of Villany, and Impudence, under the Cloak of his Religion, and the design of propagating of it, as could be imagined. The Sultana , according to divers occurrences, had given our Mufti not only a free access into her greatest retirements, but in diversion had been more free with him in her Speeches and in Carriage than with others; her Beauty and this Freedom, which he thought his good Meen and Deserts had acquired him, did so puff up his mind, that he thought it no difficult thing to ingratiate himself into the Sultana's Affections: this impudent conceit of his (I can term it no better) did set all his Wits to work to accomplish his end; to which purpose, he did watch but for an opportunity of privately delivering to the Sultana what he had to say without interruption. He was not long without one; the Sultana being one day somewhat indispos'd, was retired into her Closet, with order that she would not be disturbed by any body. Our Mufti, who was always on the watch himself, besides the Spies he employed, had soon an intelligence of it; he dress'd himself with all the advantage imaginable, set himself up in the Glass, perfum'd himself, in fine, he was fitted as a Bridegroom on his Wedding day; in this equipage he presents himself to the Sultana's Closet door, and being deny'd entrance, he took it in such scorn and contempt, that he stay'd not a second repulse, but turning the Lock, entred of his own accord, and boldly intrudes upon the Sultana , who was looking over of some Papers; he comes up to her briskly, and making a profound reverence, Madam , said he, your Servant would have deny'd me entrance to you . The Sultana , who was amaz'd to see him so gay, so brisk, and so much more confident than usually, though he never wanted any, looking upon him, as somewhat surpriz'd, told him, That the Servant had done nothing but what he had in charge, for that she being indispos'd, she had retir'd with a design not to be disturb'd, but since that he was come, she bid him to tell her what he had to say. Madam , said he, I am sorry I have thus intruded on your privacy; and the business I come about requires a long discourse, with a great deal of attention: I think it will be best for me to defer the opening of it to another time, and at present to retire. If the business is not of such a nature as to lend fewel to a certain Melancholy which has seiz'd me at present; I should rather chuse this time than any other, to hear what you have to say , reply'd the Sultana: It may afford me some diversion; and as things are order'd on other accounts, you may not be disturb'd in the relation: Place your self at ease, and let me hear what you would say . This good beginning did still inspire our Mufti more and more with Hope and Joy, which was so great that it discover'd it self upon his Face, in his Eyes, and in all his Actions; having fitted himself for to deliver his Speech, he thus began; It cannot be unknown to you, Madam, how instrumental I have been, through the assistance of Heaven, in bringing about the great work of extirpating of Heresie out of this Empire, and of settling in it the Religion of our Great Prophet Hali : Since that it has reach'd the great Mufti's Ears, who upon that information, has Commissionated me to go on with that work so well begun, and to finish it, according as I shall find occasions to act. You also know, Madam, with how little success all Physical means have been used, both as to your person and to the Emperor's; so that all helps are laid aside of having a young Successor from his Loyns. I am not of your Opinion, replyed the Sultana , and I believe that the defect lyes more in me than in the Emperor, for though I seem not to see, that I might not in the least check his pleasures, I know very well, that of late he has had a Child by one of his Mistresses. Madam, replyed our Mufti, you know not the Wiles and Artifices of those kind of Creatures, they value not who gets their Children, they adopt them to what Father they think are most proper to own them, it is sufficient only that they have once enjoyed the man; to perswade him, nay convince him, that he is the true and right Father of the Child they go with; they go yet further, Madam, according to the persons inclinations, to one Sex more than another, the Child shall be right or wrong of that very Sex; or there shall be no child in the whole Empire of that Sex, to make a change with. I cannot think however, but that I am more in the fault than Amurat, replyed the Sultana , I am apt to believe that a certain decay which I feel in me, is the cause of my having no Children of late, wherefore I am desirous to try, what the Heavens will do, being solicited to that purpose, by those Holy Prayers, Pilgrimages, and Offerings, which you your self have proposed, and that have been resolved upon both by the Emperor and the whole Court, and it is no little wonder to me to find you so soon, in so contrary a mind. Madam replyed the Mufti, I must deal plainly with you, I have not, I confess, all the faith that might be imagin'd in those things; of truth, they are good and necessary, pious frauds, to amuse the Vulgar withal, and to work divers good and Religious ends; and it is to that purpose only, that we have now designed them, to please and blind the people, and to exalt our Religion, with which none can compare for contriving of Miracles, of which that of your proving with Child presently upon the return from the Pilgrimage, however otherways the Child were got, would be none of the least, but to the purpose. Madam, give me leave to tell you, Therefore that what I now propose, is not in the least to put off the Pilgrimage, on the contrary, it is to the same end. I have read something of Physick, have seen some operations, and dissections, and I am sufficiently versed in those Arts, to be bold enough to lay a Wager, that the defect is not in the least in you, Madam. How can we be sure of that , replyed the Sultana? How, Madam? answered he again, if you made use of any other person than the Emperor to trye the Experiment, and that I had layed a great sum on it, I should soon draw the Stakes. You speak of things that cannot be , replyed the Sultana. That cannot be, Madam , replyed the Mufti, say rather, Madam, that you will not admit to be? Is it not my Duty not to admit of any such thing ? said she hastily, raising her voice. Yes, Madam , said the Mufti, according to the common Rules; but, Madam, when the welfare of Empires, the extirpating of Heresies, the establishing of true Religion call for our Assistances, all those little particular Rules cease, they are overrul'd by an higher power, and in the very design and intention of establishing of Religion, all these small tyes upon our Duties, vanish into Air; nothing can be too good , too great, nor too holy, not to be sacrificed to so laudable and so pious a work. That great and general Duty, swallows up, and dispences with all those little ones, which at other times are in force; all must yield to that great work: and that which at any other time would appear unjust or unlawful, becomes the most just, lawful, and necessary good that can be done, when it is for the good of the Church. This Doctrine is so new to me , answered the Sultana, that I am more surpriz'd at, than edified by it. This, Madam, I have foreseen , said the Mufti, and it is for that reason, that I did chuse this opportunity, in which, without disturbance, I might infuse those weighty Reasons, which I have in order to perswade you, to condescend to so just a request as I am going to make to you. You have surprized me, I say once again, and the nature of the business requires some serious considerations. Not that I in the least incline to what you propose, but that I may arm my self with such Arguments, against those new Doctrines which you set up, that I may have some colour for my refusal, besides, the natural abhorrence which I find in me towards what you propose, and I wish that some other means might be found out, in which I might be so happy as to serve the Church. None greater than this, Madam , Replyed the Mufti, who would not so easily be put by, and give me leave to add, Madam, to what I have said already, that the Emperor is obliged for the forwarding of so great a work, to give his consent to it, only all the business in this case is, that it must be made a Mystery, a Court-Secret, to avoid all Scandal: for in such Cases, Sin (if it may be call'd so, considering to what a pious end it is acted) becomes none, and the Scandal; only which might arise from the Knowledge, and the divulging of so great a Secret, becomes sin. In a word, Madam, do but chuse a Person secret, discreet, and in all other respects according to your liking, and the Blessing of Heavens go along with the work . In saying these words, the Mufti pricked up himself, that the Sultana should take more notice of his person, and perceiving that she made no answer, Let me further tell you, Madam , continued he, that this is not the first time, such things have been acted, still to a good end, though never none to so great and pious an end as this. It was but in the last Age, that a Neighbouring Empire to this, had fallen into the hands of its Enemies, had not a Mufti been employed to get an Heir unto it; of truth, Madam, there are no fitter persons in the World than those of the Clergy, for such works, in divers respects; and especially, I would advise you, Madam, to employ in this, one whose fidelity, trust, and fore- knowledge and pre-ingagements in this our great work, is throughly known to you, that you may easily gain to you, without making any more persons privy to those Mysteries, and great Arcanas of States; for in these Cases, it is most certain, that the fewer are employed, the more secure the business is from discovery . Here the Mufti made a full stop, not daring to discover his intention more plainly, (though he had said enough already) till he heard how the Sultana did resent it; and perceiving, that instead of giving him some answer, she busied her self in perusing of the papers that were before her. This slight did so offend him, that, he could not forbear saying, I am sorry Madam, that I, who have already done so much for your service, and that of the Church, and who is ready to lay down his life for the service of so great, and so charming a Princess as you are, should be so little regarded, and his good advises so little valued . And with that he put himself in a posture of going, at which the Sultana , not so much as looking once on him, said, I have already told you, that I would take time to weigh your Reasons, and the nature of the thing you propose to me, and then after that I would give you my answer, till then forbear giving your self or me any further trouble about it, I have a mind to sleep, so good night . Though our Mufti had a months mind to have stay'd longer, and to have ventured a little further, in pointing at the most proper person for the work, which he fancyed to be himself, this unexpected answer from the Sultana with her hasty rising up, did force him to a decent retreat, which he did without answering one word more, after he had made a profound Reverence. The Mufti being gone, the Sultana reseated her self, and doubtless made many and great reflections on things propos'd to her, by a Mufti too, which were so opposite to her Principles and Inclinations; after which, having call'd for attendance, she charg'd very strictly all that were about her, and whose duties were to keep the doors, not to permit the Mufti Repset , on any pretence whatsoever, to enter, when they knew that she was retired, and alone; she was resolv'd to give him no more the opportunities of uttering such discourses, so unbeseeming his Function to speak, and her Modesty and Greatness to hear; and she knew well enough how to avoid his impertinencies, should he attempt any before Company; and of truth, she was so offended at his late discourse, that had it not been that he was a necessary Instrument in forwarding the work (already begun) of Reformation: She would have acquainted the Emperour with his attempt, and have had him dismist the Court. But notwithstanding the Sultana's aversion to all such sorts of ill ways, she had another charge by our Mufti, though not altogether of the same nature, who came accompanied with two or three more, that were Ministers of State, and privy Counsellors, which demanded for admittance into a private Conference with the Sultana , on pressing affairs, which oblig'd the Sultana to give them admittance. This second visit was on the account, that notwithstanding a day had been prefix'd for the entring on the Pilgrimage, there was still something or other in the wind which broke it off; wherefore they now came with threatnings, to terrify the Sultana into a compliance with their designs. The Mufti told the Sultana that since the last time that he had the honour of entertaining her, he had been divers times to learn her resolutions, but that not being admitted her presence, and the business they were come about pressing, he had associated to himself those other worthy Persons, to communicate an Affair, though not quite of the same nature as the former, yet tending to the same end, which was the good of the Church, and the glory of Ala . The Sultana reply'd, That she was very desirous to be instrumental in so Pious and Good a Work, provided it were not by any sinister ends. To wave entring upon the late Discourse I had with you, Madam , said the Mufti, we are come here to let you know, that for very high and weighty reasons you must forthwith, and without any further delays, set forth in Pilgrimage to the Holy Waters with the Emperour, and immediately after you have made your Offering and Devotions, give out that you are with Child: and you must so order matters, that every body may give credit to it, for those very reasons which have already been given you. And I , said the Sultana, tell you for answer, as I have already told you, that I will never consent to any such thing, nor impose upon the World thus, to the exclusion of the right Heir, without the Emperor's consent, and I am already certain before hand, that he will never give his assent to so ill a practice. Madam , said one of the Councellors, we have reason to believe it, for we have already been deny'd by the Emperor, though we have us'd all the Arguments imaginable to perswade him to it, on the contrary, we have found so much and so great an aversion in him, towards such a thing, that we despair ever bringing him to it; wherefore we are come, Madam, to denounce to you from his Sanctity, the Grand Mufti, that all you have done hitherto is of no value, if you persist not in doing all the good you can for the advancement of the Universal Faith; and that in lieu of gaining any advantage by what you have already done, you are immediately to be pronounced degraded from all the fair and assured hopes of Honour and Glory, which you were to have receiv'd in this and the other world, in case you had persisted to the end, and you are immediately to be deliver'd up to the Prince of Darkness, to do with you at his Pleasure. Wonder not at this proceeding, Madam , said then our Mufti, it is but justice, that punishments should be in some measure proportionable to the Crime for which they are inflicted, and can there be a greater, than to (wilfully and meerly to gratifie some few shallow scruples) be the immediate cause of the destruction of so great a work, so happily begun, and so prosperously gon on . You have no more therefore to do, but to countenance the business, to shape you a great belly, which you must increase as the time of your reckoning will require; to which purpose you must confide in three or four women, which you shall think fit to intrust with so great a secret, which may assist you all the time of your feigned Breeding, and at the time of your delivery also. I find so much difficulty in all this, reply'd the Sultana , that I know not what to say, nor what to do, I would do much to avoid those horrid threatnings which are preparing to be put in execution against me; but on the other hand, how is it possible that I should in the first place deceive the Emperor, who being made jealous of some trick acted against his will, will be the more curious in the detection of it; and if he should at any time desire, for his satisfaction, to feel the stirring of the Child in my body, How shall I prevent him from taking that liberty of satisfying himself? Besides, grant this was feasable: How is it possible to delude so many great Persons highly interessed in this great business, who by the Law of the Empire are to be present, that of Mahomet's Religion, and who have at present so much fears upon them, and so much cause to suspect foul play, that they will be more diligent than usually in respect to the business? To this we answer, Madam, in the first place, that the very solemnity of the Pilgrimage, will be of great moment; next, that as to the Emperor, we foreseeing such a thing, have provided against that inconveniency, by letting him know, as we have done already, that we have reciv'd an Holy Ointment, with which your Belly being once rubb'd, to prevent miscarriage, no prophane hands must for ever after offer to touch it till after delivery; and to that purpose, Madam, when you have once given out to the Emperor, that you are with Child by him, you must keep your self so close lapped up, that he may not, by any surprisal when you are asleep, attempt the Tryal. He is so exact an observer of all things, which the Church imposes upon him, that after you have once assured him of the thing, he will be one of the first that will rejoice at your pregnancy, and that will spread it abroad. And as to the other doubt you have rais'd, Madam, in the first place, long before hand, we shall get several Women that reckon about the time we have prefixt, that amongst them we may have a Male- Child to substitute for yours; and as to the ways of conveyance of it into the Bed to you, there are a hundred ways besides warm Clothes, warming-pans, trapp-doors, back-doors, and private windows at the Bedshead to bring a Child in; pish those things are practis'd every day, especially amongst us of the Clergy, who are not permitted to marry; but because the grand Mufti knows that we, and he himself, are made of the same Flesh and Blood as other men, we are permitted the use of Women in private, and without giving Scandal, by which conversation it frequently happens, that we are put to such and the like Shifts; then let us alone for ordering things, so as that none but those of our Sect shall be present, at the time of your pretended delivery, some shall be sent one way, others dispers'd in other places, so that all will have the wished for success that we all desire and pray for. The Sultana having attentively hearkned to what had been said, and being beforehand terrified with those horrid threatnings which they had denounc'd, considering within her self that all the evil that was in it, they took upon themselves, and that she had no further end in it, but the good advancement of her Religion, she consented, though yet not without some kind of Reluctancy; and told them, that since they assured her, that they would take upon themselves all the evil that she might fancy to be in the Action, and that they would stand by her always, encounter and oppose all the Jealousies which the Emperor might have on this Affair; she yielded to their desires, and said she would immediately go to the Emperor, and fix on a certain day to set forth. All things being thus agreed upon, they left the Sultana to perform her part, and every one of them went about to act theirs, in order of bringing about this grand work. Here we shall leave once more the Court, to give a visit to poor Roxana , who through the great care of those that were about her, had perfectly recovered her Senses, but was so melanchollick and so dejected, that she avoided all Society, having no delight but to walk in her Garden, and to visit the Summerhouse, in which she had first seen her beloved Ibrahim ; though not without great disturbances; and some time, when it came into her mind, looking on the place where she last saw him, what a dismal sight it was to her, to see him weltering in his own Blood. Mufti Repset had continually from time to time, given her Visits, and such of his Counsels and Advises as he thought fit, and finding her to be perfectly recovered of her alienation of mind, and fancying her more beautiful than ever, in that negligent dress she now did wear, especially after the loss of all his Amorous hopes towards the Sultana , he resolved to change his Note, and under pretence of diverting her from her deep Melancholy, to entertain a commerce of Love, and gallantry with her. This was easie for him to do, for what with the Liberty usually allowed to Persons of his Profession, the small care, or rather little Love which her Father had for Roxana after this miscarriage; and that part which Zora acted, who was the Mufti's Sister, as I have told you already, in her Brother's interest; the Mufti had opportunity enough, to declare his mind to Roxana , with all the Liberty and privacy imaginable. He made as much use of it as he possibly could, unto which his Sister Zora , who had been with Roxana ever since her distraction, did not a little contribute. She was a Lady of the Town, one that lov'd much more to sing a Lampoon, than to turn over her Beads, she was for all Commerse; all Ages, Complexions, Humours, Conditions, so they but brought Grits to the Mill, were welcome. But above all, she had a particular inclination for a brisk young man, of good Parentage, good Meen, Education, and Inclinations, but of little or no Fortune, whose name was Cara , and who had as little hopes of getting any at Court; for being no Halist , and having but a small stock of ready Cash, wherewith to push on his Fortune. Zora affecting this young Man, as I have said, she did all she could to gain his Affections, but he knowing what a course of life she had always lead, he was not very forward on the business, no further than to take his share in the Croud, amongst the rest of those that kept her Company. She was handsome, and of a pretty good Conversation, but above all, she was Sister to the all-doing Repset , the Mufti . This last made him to incline very much to humor Zora , when he considered what influence she had over her Brother, who was all at Court; he knew that Zora was inform'd of his Religion, and seeing, that notwithstanding, that she took all occasions of expressing her kindness towards him, though she never would admit him to the last Favour, as having other designs upon him particularly, he began to build upon that bottom, and on that account, did visit her frequently. She on her part, thinking that his repeated Civilities, were the pure effects of her Beauty, she did all she could to add lustre to that proportion which Nature had bestow'd on her with a Liberal hand: Thus did Cara and Zora live in good intelligence together, which was not discontinu'd, when she came into Aladin's family, though she was then oblig'd, to bid farewell to that great troop of Followers, which she formerly entertain'd, and was oblig'd to divert her self by stealth in that Nature, in private Corners. For though Aladin , like the rest, was forced to hold a Candle to the Devil, more for fear than love or worship, which had made him yield to the taking of Zora into his Family at the first request, which Repset had made him. It was with a Resolution of not permitting any ill thing to be acted in his House, abroad she might do what she pleas'd, but what Devil soever she was then, she was to be a Saint in Aladin's House, and in this her Brother the Mufti had not lost his aims, which were to get her a good Name again, if it were possible, which he knew she might as soon get in Aladin's Family, as in a Convent, which had made him take the Opportunity of offering her service in the behalf of Roxana , which at that time was accepted more freely, than it might have been at any other juncture. One day Zora seeing Cara pass by Aladin's Gates, she sent a slave to let him know that she would speak with him. He came to her, and she told him, that she could not doubt of the knowledge which he must have gain'd by this time, of her affections towards him, but to let him know that her intentions were real, and that she had retired her self into Aladin's sober Family, but to give her self more intirely up to him, she would now at that very time present him to her Brother, who was then in the House, and ingage him to take a particular care of him, and to obtain from the Emperor some considerable preferment, but that this should be on condition that he should make her a promise of marrying her. This word Marriage did not a little surprise Cara , he was so disturbed at it, that he stood mute, which gave time to Zora to continue thus. What are you so great a Libertine, as to be affrighted at a bare proposal of Marriage? No, Madam, not at the word , replyed Cara, but at the thing it self, for having never yet spent one thought that way, it now a little intangles my Wits to find out an answer, suitable to my thoughts, and the honour you do me. Well, I'll allow you three days , replyed Zora, to consider of the Business ; in the mean time, I will be beforehand with you, and instantly present you to my Brother . He was returning most humble thanks to her, when that a noise being heard, he is coming , said she, I'll go and meet him ; with that she stept towards the Mufti , who was going out, and told him, that there was a Gentleman which she would recommend to his particular care, as a person, though no Halist , yet that in all other respects, did deserve his friendship and favour. At these words, the Mufti , to whom good words, and fair promises, never cost any thing, whatever the effects were, came to meet Cara , who was coming to salute the Mufti , and told him, Sir, my Sister has beforehand given me such a Character of you, if your name is Cara, that will oblige me to serve you with the utmost of my power; you may firmly build on that fond, and so soon as I can possible, I shall make you sensible of the effects of my Promises; but you must have a little patience, my hands are full, do but put me in mind of you sometimes, by appearing before me, or before my Sister, and your business is done . Cara was going to return him a great Complement of thanks, when he thus interrupted him, Look you, Sir , said the Mufti, I know what you would, and what you should say, time is precious, be assured that I'll be as good as my word, my Sister shall engage for me, and so Sir, your Servant . With that he took his Sister by the hand, and led her in another Room, which made Cara retire, to reflect on Zora's news proposals. The Mufti had so heated himself near Roxana , who being that day in a little more pleasing humour than usually, with the assurances that her Father had given her, to carry her into the Country again; that it had added much Lusture to her natural Beauty, which of late had been clouded with the black fumes of Melancholy, upon the hopes of being in a short time freed from this Priest's impertinencies. She had been a little more free than ordinary in her Conversation, which had made him to offer at more Liberty than usual; this had so offended her, that she had risen from her Seat, and left the room. At which our Mufti all on a fire, had taken pet, and was gone down, to make his Complaint to his Sister, and to acquaint her with his Resolutions. Dear Sister , said he to her, you can no more be ignorant of the Love which I have for Roxana, than I am of that which you have for Cara. I have given yon my word, that I will prefer him to a considerable Employ, and that I will oblige him first to marry you; and I here assure you anew, that I will perform all that I have promised you to a title; but my Dear Zora, you must take pity on me also. I must tell you that I can no longer live, except I enjoy Roxana. Oh! how the thought of her disturbs my heart , added he? I have used all the fair means imaginable, and she proves the more obdurate to all my supplications, to all my submissions, and to all my Vows. What must I do in this condition ? There pausing, Zora made this answer. Sir, I pity your condition the more, because that mine is of the very same nature. And seeing you have so generously offered me your assistance, I can do no less than to assure you of mine, but speak what you would have me do, and 'tis done. But remember this, both for my sake, as well as your own, that no time must be lost, because Aladin has given orders to his Servants to be in a readiness, to march to his Government three days hence; wherefore you must be quick in the execution of your resolutions. For that matter , replyed the Mufti, let me alone, I, who govern the Emperor, will easily deal with Aladin; and oblige him to retard his Journey at my pleasure, nay and if there is occasion, as you will find there will be, when I have told you all; I will have him so suddenly sent into the Country, that he shall not have time to take above a Servant or two with him, therefore Dear Zora, set your heart at Rest, that way. But to the point. I have been thinking that some little forcible attempt might prevail more with Roxana's humour, than all other means that I have tryed yet. I know that some Women will be forc'd, that they may have that to say for themselves, when afterwards they readily comply with our desires. I have a great mind to try what that will do, when Aladin is gone, but without you I can do nothing in it; it is you that must distance the Mother from Roxana's Apartment, and that must either send out of doors, or employ at distance, all the Servants, that none may hear her Cryes, in case she would be so foolish, and let me alone for the rest. I will attempt her but once more by fair means, and then I'le go to extreams . Well, Brother, said Zora , be you assur'd of me, let it be your business to get Aladin remov'd far enough from hence, against that time for his prying Eye, and distrustful disposition, would spoil all, and be sure not to forget Cara . Trust to me, dear Sister, answered Repset , and let me alone to manage things. With that he took leave of his Sister, and went his way. Aladin growing weary of the Mufti's too frequent visits to his Daughter, and of Zora's Intreagues, how close soever she carry'd them, was resolv'd to put an end to both, by retiring to his Government, seeing that he no longer had any Business to do in Constantinople , and he had dispos'd of all things to be in a readiness to transport himself and his whole Family thither, with a full resolution never to let his Wife nor Daughter see that great City again, at least so long as the last were under his Government, which he hoped would not be long, for he was resolved to marry her out of hand, so soon as he were got down, to any Gentleman that would have her, to free himself from the trouble of observing her. To this purpose, he went to the Court to ask the Emperor's leave to retire the next morning to his Government, but he was come too late. The Mufti had already influenced the Emperor, that Aladin's presence was necessary for some time longer here, at least till a particular Council were over, at which he was to assist, which would not be till two or three days hence. This had the Mufti done, that he might have the Opportunity of giving Roxana one Visit more, in which he would use all the Rhetorick imaginable to gain her Affections, and which should be the last, if he did not succeed. Aladin having receiv'd the Emperor's absolute Orders not to stir, till that Consultation was over, he return'd home in order to obey it, but with a firm resolution that so soon as it were over, to be gone without any further leave, but take hold of the Emperor's words, who had told him he should not go till that time was over; wherefore he still kept all things in readiness for his Journey, only acquainting with it his Wife, and Roxana , who was daily courting of him to be going, as much as the Mother had a desire to stay, for she thought her self young enough yet to make a Figure at Court. Cara all this while had leasure to reflect on what Zora had propos'd to him, and did not know what course to take. He had a fancy towards her, and would gladly have establish'd a commerce of Gallantry betwixt themselves, but when the thoughts of marrying her came in his head, that would so pall his appetite, that nothing could quicken it again, but the hopes that her Brother would get him into some considerable employment; that would again make him resolve not to break off wholly with Zora: in this his fluctuation of thoughts, he at last designed to steer a middle course betwixt Sylla and Charibdis , to avoid the dangerous Rock of Matrimony, and that of want and necessity also, by offering Zora a verbal promise of Marriage, which he would engage to perform when he was throughly settled in an Employ, though he never intended it: In this design he resolves to go see Zora , he finds her at Aladin's , and lets her know that he was come to tell her that the love he had for her was sufficient of it self to oblige him to do any thing that she should require of him, but that he thought it prudence to be fully possess'd and fix'd in some Office or Employ by the Mufti's means before he married her, for fear that that being once done, the Mufti's willingness to serve him should slacken, or that he should quite give over all thoughts of assisting him. This so reasonable a request did stop Zora's mouth, so that she had nothing to say, but that she knew so well her Brother, that besides the interest and share that she had, or at least expected to have in the business, he was a person that would be as good as his word, so soon as it could be done without prejudice to the rest of his Concerns; that in the mean time, she desired his frequent visits, declaring that she was never well pleased but in his company; and that he did not know how much it would oblige her and her Brother, if that he would give her a verbal assurance of Marrying her, as he had already promis'd, when things were settled to his mind. I am so far, Madam , replyed Cara, from refusing you so just a request, and so much conformable to my own desires, that I will propose further, with your leave, to confirm this promise , and to make it a firm marriage betwixt you and I. 'Tis the Mufti, that I fear, and not you; I will consummate the Marriage by bedding you privately. You know, Madam, that Marriages are made in Heaven, that we do but ratify them here on Earth, that that is performed by our mutual consents, and that the outward and pompous Ceremonies thereof are but to 'satisfy the World that such a Man and such a Woman are going to lye by consent with one another; and why may not we do that without all that bustle, when our hearts have before hand agreed upon the point? I know that what you say, is true , replyed Zora, but should you prove false to me after all, then should I be wanting in the means to right my self, which a publick Matrimony would afford me. That is an errour, Madam, give me leave to tell you , replyed Cara; for were I so ill inclin'd, that could not hinder me from leaving you , at least, and what difference betwixt the one and the other? But you must not fear any such thing from a Person that has so much Love and Respect for you as I have. Well, I find , replyed Zora, that you have a charming Tongue, which with the concurrence of my Love towards you, makes me apt to give credit to what you say. You may rely on me in this, Madam , reply'd Cara, as on an Oracle. I will be true to you, nay, to my self, I should say; for my Love to you makes me to espouse your Interest as my own: do but consent to afford me time and Opportunity of turning the verbal Promise you required of me, into an absolute marriage, by receiving me into your Bed, into your arms . Well, replyed Zora , Since that I have already, long since, received you into my heart, I shall the less stand upon terms, on the assurance you give me, that you will publickly own our private marriage, when you are once firmly fixed in some handsome Employ, I yield to your desires, and I will take but a day or two's time to contrive how to manage the business, that we may not be discovered; after which I shall give you notice of the time and place. In the mean time fail not to see me every day, and never abuse the trust which I put in you. Cara answered Zora with kisses, after which having once again assur'd her of his constancy, he went his ways. The Mufti , whose Love to Roxana did render as impatient and restless as could be imagin'd, had not patience to defer the last tryal which he design'd, of his Addresses to Roxana ; he did not fail to give her a visit the next day, notwithstanding the repulse which he had so lately received from her; but so soon as she had heard that the Mufti was return'd, she had got into her Mother's Company, and would not admit of his Visit, but in her Mother's presence; he was forced to comply to that, for fear of giving any suspicion, wherefore he went in, and fell to compliment both Mother and Daughter, but much after another manner than he had done the day before. However, he seem'd so complaisant, that the mother was exceedingly pleas'd with his Conversation; he stayed the longer in hopes that in time, business would call the Mother away, or that she would go of her self; but he was very much mistaken in that, she still had a Colts Tooth of her own, and the Mufti's very eajoling of her Daughter, tickled her Fancy so, that she sometimes would apply the discourse to her self, and would answer accordingly, not without tacitly promising her self, to repeat such pleasing Conversation as often as she could, during her stay at Constantinople . At last the Mother was whispered by a Servant, that some Company was come to give her a Visit, she arose presently to receive them; and so soon as Roxana saw her Mother's motion, she likewise did rise to follow her, but for all that she could do, the Mufti did hold her so fast, that she was forc'd to stay. I find, Madam, said he , that you have resolved to render me desperate; how cruel are you, to see a man, such a one as I am, dye at your feet without the least regret for having been the cause of it? If I am the cause of any Evil to you, replyed Roxana , I assure you that I am a very innocent one. I should be sorry to cause the least disturbance to my Enemies, much less would I be guilty of such a Crime as you lay to my Charge, against a Person whose Function I Honour and Respect. Good, Madam, replyed the Mufti , less of Honour and Respect to the Profession, and more of Love and Complaisance to the Person: You know, Madam, that I adore you, I have told you more than once, that I cannot live without you, take pity of me. Sir, I have already told you I do, and I again tell you so, the rather, because I am so unhappy as not to be in a capacity of easing you of your trouble, what can I say or do more? Repay my Affections and Love with yours, reply'd the Mufti , and Cross not for ever the saying, that Love begets Love. Why, to tell you the truth, Sir, that Proverb is no Friend of yours, for every time I think on't I am convinc'd, that all you say to me is down right Gallantry and Amusement, because that I find no other Inclination in me but of such like Diversion, but not one grain of Love, I can assure you. The more miserable wretch am I, Madam, said he ; it is like that some other is more happy than me, though not more in Love, nor more deserving in any other respect. Pardon me. Sir, replyed Roxana , if I am not prepar'd at present for Confession, another time I may give you that trouble, till then, your Servant, with that she run out of the Chamber so suddenly, that he could not overtake her. This usage did quite put him beside the Cushion, he was at once in love, mad, angry, and full of spight. He went off with a resolution to have a full revenge of the Daughter on the Father. To that end, that very night he inform'd the Emperor, that some Rumours which were spread abroad of some insurrection in or near Aladin's Government, did require his immediate presence there, that in case there were any occasion for it, he might quell the disturbance, or by his presence prevent any such Designs, so that the Emperor would do well to give him notice that very night to be gone early in the morning. The Emperor told him, that but the day before, he had advised him to retain Aladin at Constantinople a while longer, wherefore he wonder'd at the sudden Alteration of his Council. The Mufti answer'd, that these news having been spread abroad, not without some grounds, since he had given him that advice, he thought that now it was necessary to alter it. Well, said the Emperor , send for him in my Name, and I'le give him orders to depart to morrow. In the Morning, Sir, said the Mufti , for we know not what his delay of some hours might produce. Well, said the Emperor, be it so; little dreaming of the Mufti's aim in it, which was, that Aladin might not have so much time, as to take his Wife and Daughter with him, which he feared he might do, with two or three Servants, and leave the rest to follow, should he have any longer time aloud him. Aladin was sent for, and he receiv'd Command from the Emperor, to depart the next morning early towards his Government. He was surpris'd at the order, and considering the Mufti's assiduous visits to his Daughter, he mistrusted that he had a hand in the business, and that it was with a design to retain Roxana in town; he was the more troubled too, because his Wife began also to hearken to the Mufti's Tales; this made him to desire of Amurat , but so much time as to take his Wife and Daughter, with some few Servants, with him, assuring him that he would be gone in twenty four hours. The Emperor, thinking that there was not so great and pressing a necessity, for Aladin's departure, as the Mufti had suggested, did grant him his request; for which favour Aladin having return'd his thanks, he went home, to use all diligence for his depart. He presently gave order to his Wife and his Daughter to be in a readiness against next Morning, very early; he did appoint all those of his Servants that should go along with him, and those that should come after; and gave order for all other things requisite for the Journey. The Mufti was not present when that Amurat had granted a day longer to Aladin's desires, wherefore he knew nothing of that stop; and Aladin had been so cunning that he had not given any notice of it to Zora , and had forbid his Wife and Daughter to speak of it, for fear she should have given her Brother some information, who would have again broke his measures; so that the Mufti at his usual time of visit fail'd not to come to Aladin's House, as he us'd to do: he thought that now he was secure enough from being interrupted by Aladin ; but he still was in fear of the troublesome Mother's company, which was not requisite, on the account of his visit to Roxana , but he thought that he would find a way to employ her elsewhere. He stay'd not to be usher'd in, as usually, but briskly getting up stairs, humming of a tune to himself, as he went; he push'd open the door of Roxana's Chamber, and rush'd in on the sudden, and was so hasty to shut the door upon him, that he might not be disturb'd by the Mother, in his last address of Courtship to Roxana , that he had not perceiv'd Aladin and the Mother, who were both in the Room. You cannot but think that he was strangely discompos'd at Aladin's presence, who he thought far off on his Journey? not in the least, I assure you; what with his accustomed confidence, and that presence of mind (which he never had but in such amorous intreagues) I come to tell you, Sir , said he to Aladin, that the Sultana hearing of Roxana's safe and perfect recovery, desires to congratulate her and her Mother of it, as she does you by me; and that to that end she will have them to attend her this Evening at the Seraglio: I have no more to say. You may wonder peradventure, why I was employ'd to deliver this Message; but the reason was, that I was desirous to be the Messenger of so good news to you. Prepare against the time, and fit your selves for so honourable a visit. As to you, Sir , turning to Aladin, you may continue your design of setting forth in the Morning ; Amurat expects you should, for which I wish you a safe conduct from our great Prophet . Having deliver'd this formal Story, I must be going , continu'd he, earnest business stays for me, wherefore I take my leave . Though Aladin did believe all this to be a Sham, he also knew that the Mufti had power and influence enough upon the Sultana to put in her head a desire to see Roxana , for whom she had a particular kindness, not doubting but that the Sultana would be glad to have an account of Roxana's late adventures from her own mouth: this was the Mufti's opinion also; wherefore he immediately address'd his steps towards the Seraglio, and all places being open to his confidence, he soon found access unto the Sultana , in whom he easily inspir'd the desires of sending for Roxana and her Mother; which care he took upon himself, and having already done that part, he had no more to do, but to fix on the day of the violent attempt on Roxana , with his Sister Zora's assistance. They both being certain that now Aladin would be oblig'd to be gone the next morning without his Daughter, who should not return home that night, by his contrivance. They fix'd the time for the great work on the next day, about the time that Roxana came from walking in her Garden; she usually did retire into her Closet for a time: Zora undertook to keep the Coast clear; and the Mufti assur'd her that he would act his part like a Man of Mettle. Aladin not knowing how to remedy all this, thought it his best way to leave all to Fortune, for the present; and so soon as he were got to his Government, to send for his Wife and Daughter; or to obtain leave to come and fetch them himself: mean time, he knew that it was but folly to withstand the Mufti's designs; and believing they inclin'd so much towards his Daughter, that by that means his Wife might escape; and Roxana having already been censur'd by the World, for her late misfortune, he took the whole business more patiently; and receiving a message at night from the Seraglio, that the Sultana would not part with his Wife and Daughter till the next day; he rested contented, at least seemingly so, dispatch'd the rest of his business, and set forward on his Journey early the next Morning, with two or three of his most necessary Servants. Roxana and her Mother were courteously receiv'd by the Sultana , who being crowded with visits that day, through the Mufti's contrivance, had not the conveniency of satisfying her self of Roxana's adventure, as she desir'd; that, with the Emperour's coming to partake of the relation, by the Mufti's instigation also, made it so late before the Sultana was fully satisfy'd with Roxana's company, that she oblig'd her, and her Mother, to stay there all that night, and part of the next day, after which, the Sultana dismiss'd them, not without Presents, as her Custom was to do. Roxana was in hopes that her Father would have stay'd for their return, to have taken them along with him, but the Mother wish'd on the contrary, that he might be gone, that she might enjoy more of those pleasant Conversations with the Mufti , of which she had had but a small relish, which made her mouth water for more. This that made Roxana's sorrow for Aladin's departure, when she was return'd home, was a matter of rejoycing for the Mother; and both believing that all was of the Mufti's contrivance, he was bless'd and curs'd for it, according to the divers interests of the Parties concern'd. Mean time, to make good the Proverb, That the more the Fox is curs'd, the more he thrives ; the Mufti was hugging of himself at this good success, and at the hopes he had of prospering as well, in the great work of that day; so that it was with great impatience, that he waited for the lasie Hours, that were to usher in that happy moment. Zora was likewise giving all the necessary orders beforehand, for to distance all the Servants from Roxana's Apartment, that no interruption should be given that way, and had found out a means to divert the Mother another way, so that all things were in a readiness, and seem'd to concur with the grand Design. Cara , who since the late Engagement he had with Zora , was more assiduous in his Visits than ever, seldom fail'd of seeing her once a day, he did usually take the time that Roxana walked in her Garden, because that she, not caring much for Zora's Company, would go without her, whereby Cara had the greater liberty of entertaining her; according to his Custom he came, and finding scarce any person in the body of the House, Zora her self being, just at that instant, out of the way, Cara believing that she might be in her own Chamber, went to see, but finding her not there, and passing by Roxana's Chamber, looked in, but not seeing her there neither, and that the Key was in Roxana's Closet door, he ventured in, and having knock'd, and no answer made, he made bold to open the Door and peep in. He was so surprised at the sight of so many delicate things, which compos'd the Ornament of it, that gazing earnestly on, he enter'd quite in, and forgot himself in the amazement he was. Roxana being somewhat indispos'd, did return from her Garden sooner than ordinary, she came into her Chamber, and was immediately followed into it by the Mufti , (who was in watch with Zora in a dark Corner in the passage,) so close that she had not time to reach to the Closet. So soon as he was got in, he shut the door upon him within side, and went after Roxana , who, little thinking of him, was crying out, Oh! Ibrahim, Ibrahim . Madam, said he , coming softly behind her, and taking her gently by the middle with both his hands, disturb not the dead; at this Roxana started, for she thought it had been some of her people that were giving their attendance, who had shut the door; A living Dog is better than a dead Lion, continued he , and the Comparison is not so disproportionable as you may imagin, betwixt your dead Ibrahim , and your living, most humble, most passionate, and most miserable Lover, who not able to subsist any longer without your consent, is come to dye imploring your pity and compassion; saying of this, he flung himself at Roxana's feet, who had been prevented by the Mufti , from discovering Cara in the Closet; you may imagine with what apprehensions he remained there; Roxana , infinitely surpriz'd to find her self alone with the Mufti , and the door shut, would have got to her Closet; but the Mufti taking hold of her Garment, said , Can you have so much cruelty in you, Madam, as to let me perish here, and not so much as afford me one word of Comfort? Speak, Madam, and let me know whether you doom me to life or death; there pausing, Roxana , who could not get from him, was forced to make him this answer. I wonder, Sir, that notwithstanding I have so frequently told you, that I should eternally so much love the memory of Ibrahim , that I should never afford to spare one grain of Love on any thing else, you will still persist in a fruitless pursuit of an imaginary Bliss; which you can never obtain. If the World, Madam, replyed the Mufti , is not mistaken, Ibrahim , did gain from you, what you so severely deny to me. To undeceive you, Sir, replyed Roxana, If you please to rise, for I must not see you any longer in so unbecoming a posture before me, I will tell you, that though Ibrahim was my Husband, as much as all the sacred Tyes of faithful Promises and Oaths could bind us together, never to marry any other, and to consummate that our private Contract and Mariage so soon as we had brought my Parents to consent. Know, Sir, I say, that I never admitted him to any further favour, than the most modest Virgin in the World would a person that were an absolute stranger, setting aside one single private enterview, unto which I was surpris'd, when I gave my heart wholly to him, in lieu of his that he had given me. But Madam, answered the Mufti ; your promises were made to a living man, and they did bind you no longer than till death had broke those bonds. Sir, replyed Roxana, interrupting him, with a little heat , if the Vows I made him were made void by my death, which I wish had been so, he had not been freed from his part towards my memory, had he remained alive; the same it is with me. I tell you I am still an untouch'd Maid, and that in the resolution I am at present, which I hope time will never alter, should a Lover with an Empire be offered me, I should reject it, though it were in the just and lawful account of marriage; wherefore, Sir, never think to gain any the least point over me in those sinister ways that you attempt. Then, Madam, replyed the Mufti , seeing that you are so plain, I will be so too, and tell you that my Passion being grown to that height and strength, that I can no longer be Master over it, I am now come to know of you, whether I must obtain by consent or by force, that without which I can no longer live, and be my self. This made Roxana to change Colour, look about her, and to tremble, not being able to stir from the place where she was, which was far from the Door. After this, said she , it is neither safe nor just, for me to remain here, wherefore let me go, or I shall call for aid. In vain, Madam, replyed the Mufti , I have provided before hand, against all preventions, you are in my Power. There is not one of your Servants that can so much as hear you, the door is fast, you cannot escape me; therefore, once more, Madam, I humbly beg of you to have compassion on me, and to afford me freely, what you see you cannot prevent me from taking by force, and with that he held her faster than before. Roxana , perceiving in what a danger she was, and that she was to expect nothing less than what the Mufti threatned, by the fierceness of his looks, and the fire in his Eyes, call'd out aloud for aid; at which he, with a forced smile, said, In vain all this, I am not a person to do my work by halves, I once again tell you, that no body can hear you, and that I will not lose this fair opportunity, and this advantage of giving a vent to those Flames, which would burn me up to ashes, should they remain any longer blazing in my breast. Roxana made her last effort, to get from him, towards the door, which made the Mufti say, Nay then, Madam, I must carry you to that Couch, with that taking her up in his Arms, notwithstanding all the resistance that she could possibly make, he carried her towards the Couch, at which, having given a great shriek, she fainted away in his Arms. When Cara had heard the Mufti's resolution of forcing Roxana , he had design'd to rescue her, though he run himself into great danger by it; but to disguise himself, he had put upon him a long Vest of Cloth of Silver, and flung a thick Veil over his head, and face, which conceal'd him from any bodies knowledge; so soon as he heard Roxana's last shriek, and perceiv'd through the Key-hole, by the Mufti's Violence, that it was time for him to come to her assistance; he came softly out of the Closet, and violently forcing Roxana out of the Mufti's arms, (not without flinging him forcibly on the Floor) he laid her gently down on the Couch, went to the door and opened it, after which, he return'd to Roxana , all this without speaking one word; he did what he could to bring her to life, at last she breathed again, opened her Eyes, and perceiving a strange shape by her, appear'd disturb'd at it, and presently expressed it more by a relapsing into a swoon again. Cara perceiving it, and guessing that it might be his Dress that did affright her, while she had still the apprehensions of her danger upon her, he made towards the Closet, to lay by those things he had put on, and so hastily steal out of the Chamber unseen; and being turn'd, he found that the Mufti was got away. He was but just got into the Closet again, when Zora came into the Chamber, who had doubtless been sent there by her Brother, she presently run towards Roxana , pretending a great surprise, whom she found coming to her self again, which made her run into the Closet, to get some Cordials for her; Cara not knowing what to do, not to be discover'd, clapped on again the Vail, which he had already thrown off, and standing upright against the Wall, without motion. So soon as Zora perceiv'd him at the entring into the Closet, she made a great shriek, and running out as fast as her legs would carry her, she got out of the Chamber, not minding Roxana , who was by that time quite out of her fainting fit. Cara , fearing that the longer he staid, the more difficult it would be for him to get off without being known, made after her, out of the Chamber, and being got in a blind passage, he let drop his disguise, and as well as he could, got out of the House, being perceiv'd by no body but one Slave, who was at the outward gate. Roxana having at this second apparition of the Vision, taken more notice of it, did fancy that she knew that Vest, and perceiving no body in the Room, and the door wide open, after a little pause she got off of the Couch, went into her Closet, and finding that the Vest she had seen was wanting, having lock'd the door upon her, and taken in the Key, she recover'd her self little by little, and busi'd her thought in unravelling the mystery of her great and wonderful deliverance, finding her self in the same condition that she was in before the Attempt, setting aside the disorders that her fears, and her struglings, had made in her Cloaths and mind. Roxana was not interrupted in the least by Zora , she had been so frighted, at what her Brother had told her, just passing by her, and what she her self had seen, that she had not the courage to return to Roxana's Chamber, not doubting but that Roxana would pronounce her accessary in her own thoughts, if not the chief Instrument of the Mufti's wicked enterprise, and the Mother being very busie else-where, in putting up things which were in her particular Custody, to be sent after Aladin , who could not take them along with him, through her absence, when he left the City. Roxana had full leisure to reflect on the Mufti's bold attempt, and on the strangeness of her deliverance, she remembred how near she was being ravish'd, when past hopes of all assistance, the door being lock'd on the inside by her ravisher, but could not retrieve how it came to pass that she had remain'd untouch'd, her ravisher gone, the door left open, and she delivered from all her fears, and apprehensions, when there was no body by. Then again she could not imagin who should be the Person, that should get into her Closet, how it came open, and wherefore they should go out, without saying any thing to her, with one of her Vests on, and one of her Veils over their face; all these things appear'd more like a Dream or a Vision to her than a Reality, she would have inclined to believe it so, had not she mist her Vest, and her Vail; and still remained sensible of the disturbances and disorders she was in. She had a great desire to inform her self of all these things from Zora , but she wondred that she came not near her, and conjecturing by that, that it was her guilt which made her not to appear; she could not tell which way to begin to open the business to her. She was sensible of the Mufti's boundless power, that he who had had so much impudence, as to attempt so horrid a violence upon her Chastity, in her own house too, would not be wanting to himself, by some means or other, of shifting his neck out of the Collar; nay, she even apprehended that if she should make a noise of it, he would not stick to turn all the ill of the business upon her self, and that what with his tongue, his impudence, and his ascendant over the Emperor, the Sultana , and the chiefest of the Court, he would so manage things, that he should be counted innocent, and she guilty. In this perplexity of thought she knew not what to resolve upon; she continu'd pondering on the business, without coming to any Resolution, till her Mother finding the Chamber door open, did step in to see for her Daughter, after whom she had inquired; not seeing her in the Chamber, she call'd, to know whether she was retir'd into her Closet; Roxana hearing her Mother's voice, open'd the Door, and her Mother briskly telling her, that she had been a great while very busie in sending her Father's things after him; it put her quite off of giving any account of what had happen'd, and from that Moment, she resolv'd to make no noise about it, at least for some time, till she had got as much light into the Business as she could possibly attain to. The Mother asked her whether the Mufti , according to his Custom, had not seen her that day? Truly , said she, not giving her Daughter time to answer, he is a man of excellent Conversation, and considering, that no Scandal can happen from the visits of a Person of his Profession, though never so frequently repeated, I must confess, that I should take as much delight in that sort of Diversion, as in any other that I know. What think you Daughter, are not you of my Opinion? No, Madam , replyed Roxana , being vext at the subject of their Discourse; I do not find in his Conversation that satisfaction that you imagine, and most commonly when he busies himself in telling me all the fine things that he can think of, my thoughts are so employ'd elsewhere, that I very frequently, have given him such unsuitable answers to what he has said, that he has let me know how sensible he was of my insensibility, as he was pleas'd to term it. This is to have ones thoughts wholly taken up another way answered the Mother; for shame leave off those melancholy Reflections, you daily employ upon a person that cannot so much as be sensible of them, much less to requite them, and think on some other Subject, more fitting your youth and condition. I am fix'd, Madam , replyed Roxana, and believe time which cures all things, will be defective in easing me of my trouble. We are always apt to indulge those affections which please us most , replyed the Mother, but none are so agreeable, but that in success of time, they become out of date, and almost quite defac'd out of our memory; it will be so with you , Roxana, hereafter; your grief is but young yet, it is still in its full strength and vigour, but it will grow old, decay, and wither quite away, as all things else do. I cannot tell, Madam, what I shall be, but I know what I feel now, I cannot answer for the future, but now I can admit of no greater comfort, than of thinking of what I have lost. Well , replyed the Mother, since you are so wedded still to your grief, and that I find you at this present, more than ordinarily involv'd in it, I will not go about to asswage it any more for the present, for fear of raising it higher, therefore I'll leave you . Saying of these words, her Mother went out of the Closet, and left her musing, though not wholly on that subject which she imagined. Roxana was so vext at the subject of her Mother's Discourse, which was very unseasonable at that time to her, that she was scarce able to give her Mother the respect she owed her: She resolv'd not to stir out of her Closet till she would go to Bed, and see whether Zora would come to her of her own accord, by which she might guess whether she had a hand in her Brother's late Attempt, as she question'd not but she had; but whether she had or had not, as she made a resolution in her self never to give the Mufti the liberty of speaking more with her, so she design'd to leave Zora behind her, so soon as her Father should send or come to fetch her into the Country, which he had promised her he would in a Letter which he had left behind him. The Mufti being got home, and retir'd privately into his Closet, to consider how to come off clearly of so foul a business, had given order to his Servants to say to any that should ask after him, he was not within. Of all the whole business, that which he could by no means apprehend, was the manner of Roxana's rescue from his embraces, when he was so near accomplishing his business; he could not tell what to make of it: some times he thought that he had not shut the door, then when he assur'd himself he had, he fancied that there was certainly some secret door belonging to Roxana's Chamber, which he had never heard of, nor Zora neither, or that she certainly would have secur'd it, or given him notice of it; then again he fancied that in the great haste he had made to get up and away, to the best of his remembrance, he had seen the Closet door open, and why might it not be some body that was in that Closet that had thus dash'd all his hopes in pieces? That he thought the most probable of all the conjectures which he could make: But then, how that Person should come to be there, to what end, what business he had to do in Roxana's Closet, and why in such a strange kind of disguise, for he made no question but that it was a Man, by the roughness with which he had been handled by him. All these questions which he made to himself were unanswerable; the most that he could make of it was, that he believ'd that some Man was employ'd about some business or other in the Closet, and that not willing to be known, he had come to Roxana's rescue unexpected, and after that, return'd about his business: This gave him apprehensions that he might have a greater and more difficult game to play, in the discovery of the Person, and stopping of his mouth, than in appeasing of Roxana : this did perplex him infinitely, insomuch that he knew not which way to go about to purge himself from all guilt. After he had taken divers turns in his Chamber, then return'd into his Closet, it being necessary that he should go about justifying himself without delay, he at last took up the resolution of writing a Letter to Roxana , which he would inclose in another to his Sister, and send it immediately by his Servant, to be deliver'd into Zora's own hand: He thus writ to Zora ,  What Devil, envious of my Happiness, was got into the Closet, or had plac'd that Person there, who has not only been the great and only obstacle to my Joyes, but who, I fear, may prove more difficult to lay again, I know not; but certain it is, that when I had pass'd over all other difficulties, and that I was ready to lose my self in that Ocean of Pleasures, which I was just going to enjoy, my Prey was snatch'd from me, I rudely thrown on the Floor, Roxana rescu'd, and I glad to get off so, without any further knowledg of my Enemy; I cannot think of any neglect in you, but wholly attribute all the misfortune to my unlucky Stars. Fail not to deliver this inclosed into Roxana's own hand, after you have read it and sealed it up; I hope it will in some measure appease that fury she must needs be in at present against me; and though I have no longer hopes of obtaining any thing from her by fair means, I am resolv'd not to stop there, but to go on, and to leave no Plot, Stratagem, or Surprizal unattempted, till I get my ends, seeing that it is impossible for me to live much longer without enjoying of her.  This Letter being deliver'd into Zora's hands by a trusty Servant of his, she read it, but durst not venture to deliver it to Roxana with her own hands: She dreaded to encounter the Storm which Roxana would raise against her, had she the least suspicion that she had an hand in the business; and it was very probabable that she did mistrust it; she therefore gave it to the Messenger, and bid him to take no notice of having seen her, but that he should enquire for some of Roxana's Servants, to whom he should give it, and charge him immediately to go and deliver it into Roxana's hands, while he should stay for his return. It was in short, deliver'd to Roxana who not knowing the hand, open'd and read it; but how vexed was she, when she read from whom it came, that she had not immediately sent it back again, without so much as looking upon it! but now it was too late, and since she had begun to read, she had as good go on to see the rest of it as not, she then read as follows.  I should think you to be the most insensible Person in all the World, Madam, should you not vent your Passion against me, with all the rage and fury imaginable, and nothing more could perswade me, that all you had done to save your Honour, were but feign'd, did you not think me the very worst of all men. Yes, Madam, you ought to resent in the highest nature, what I have attempted against you, and I am bound in conscience to give you that good and wholsome Advice. But after all, Madam, when you have given all that is due to your just resentments, and your revenge, let me advise and intreat you to allow justice its due also, and after you have treated me like a Criminal, so long as you had no other reason but to believe me so, you ought to receive again some good impressions of me, in your heart and mind, when you are well inform'd of my Innocence, and of the Violence that I was forced to use upon my self, before I could submit to become the Instrument by which you have receiv'd so much trouble. For who durst persist long in the refusal of the express orders of the Emperor, especially after I had so highly incens'd him at my refusal to obey him, in a thing of such a nature, which I knew would so highly offend you? Yes, Madam, Amurat being overcome with your Beauty, had a desire to know whether you had not been defiled by Ibrahim , so as to have been rendered unworthy of the Honour of his Embraces; he chose that way of Tryal, and he forc'd me to go about it. I have not yet given him an account of what I have done, and I wait to learn from you what I shall answer, according to the Inclination you may have of becoming his Mistress or not. For my part, I know how to think of you, and how to value so chast and so virtuous a Woman, and if I durst give Counsel against my Prince, I know what I would advise you to do. But, Madam, your own Chast thoughts are sufficient to inspire you with such an Answer, as is fitting and suitable to so much goodness as you are Mistress of. Leave me not long without an answer, that I may frame accordingly my report to the Emperor. I doubt not, but after this Information, of the reasons of my rash proceedings against you, you will take care to clear me from being censur'd by that Person that insolently took the rest of the work out of my hands, just when I was going to desist from any further prosecution of that in which you had so intirely satisfi'd me, that you might have seen that my Commission ending there, I had no more to do, than beg your pardon for what I had done, so much against my own inclinations, and that profound respect which I have for so Charming a person.  These Reasons how plausible they might appear to the Mufti and Zora , did so ill consist with the method he had taken, the Violence he had us'd, the passion, or rather rage, that he had exprest, during the attempt, and his former lustful sollicitations, besides those passionate Expressions in the Letter, that Roxana did but admire at his Impudence, that employed Amurat's Name and Commands, to justifie his Beastliness; upon that she tore the Letter in a thousand pieces, and confirm'd her self in the Resolution of never more giving him the least opportunity imaginable of speaking to her, and presently taking Pen Ink, and Paper, she writ to Aladin , to most humbly and earnestly intreat him to come, and deliver her from that Misery she liv'd in, through the wicked Mufti's means, and immediately dispatch'd a Messenger with the Letter to her Father. Having thus settled her mind again, she call'd for some of her Attendants to put her in Bed. Zora thought that a fit time to appear in, before Roxana , because that she thought she would not take notice of any thing, before her other Servants, and that so soon as she were in Bed, she would retire to her Chamber; so that she might see and guess by her looks, at the agitation of her Heart, and so proceed as she should find occasion. The Servants being come, Zora appear'd also with the Vest and Vail which had been found in the dark Corner. Look you, Madam , said she, what has been found in the dark Passage! Can you tell who laid them there , replyed Roxana? If you could do that you would pleasure me for I am sure that I am infinitely oblig'd to that Person, who ever he be, that took the pains to carry them so far, and I wish he had them for his pains. They are worth acceptance, I assure you, Madam , said Zora. If you think so , replyed Roxana, do so much for me, as to make a strict enquiry all about the House, to find out the Person, and if you can discover him, present them from me to him, but if you cannot learn who it is, pray accept of them your self. Roxana spoke this with something of Chearfulness, which made Zora to believe that Roxana had accepted of the Mufti's Reasons as sufficient. That made her venture to ask her, whether she design'd an answer to the Letter she had lately receiv'd, for which there was a Servant waited below. No , replyed Roxana, I leave it to the Persons own discretion, that writ it, who is too well supply'd with that, to want my advice, and not to act in it for the better, as he shall think fit . Saying this she went in Bed, and ordered that the Curtains should be close shut, and no noise made, because she would go sleep, which oblig'd all the Servants to retire, and Zora with them. All that Zora could do, to satisfie her own Curiosity, and to serve her Brother, in the discovery of Roxana's Deliverer, was to no effect. No body in all the House could give her an account of him, only a slave told her, that about such a time, he had seen a Man go out of the House hastily, whom he knew not. She fancied it might be Cara , who after his usual manner, coming to give her a Visit, and not finding her, was gone back again to his Lodgings. To be certain of this, she presently dispatch'd a Servant to him, to let him know that she would speak with him, and in case he was not at home, to leave word that he should come to her, so soon as he was come in, or very early the next morning. Roxana's dubious answer, did work very much in Zora's mind, and she thought that it would do so in her Brother's also, wherefore she sent word of it in writing to the Mufti , and inform'd him besides, of all that she could; this made the Mufti to come to Aladin's house that very night, to consult with his Sister, what was to be done, and upon that to take new Measures, in the pursuance of his first designs, to which he was two much wedded, to ever leave them unaccomplished. Zora acquainted him with all that she knew, and he repeated to her all that he had done, and the result was, that least Roxana should by some means or other, break all their Measures, the Mufti should make another attempt upon her, but with more Craft, and less of force. To this end it was concluded, that the Mufti should provide a good proportion of some choice preparation of Opium, by which it should be quicken'd in its operation, and weaken'd in its taste, and that Zora should administer it to Roxana , in that Dish of Coffee, which she used to take every night going to bed. The time to do this was appointed to be the following Night, and the hour, when all the rest of the Family were retir'd. After this the Mufti return'd home, and Zora went to her Bed. Cara all this while had not wanted matter to busie his thoughts with, but above all, he had been wondring at the Mufti's bold attempt, to which he doubted not but Zora did assist, and at the fair escape which he had made out of the Closet, without being discover'd, after he had had the good Fortune to prevent the Execution of so great a piece of Villany, and the happiness of serving Roxana in so high a measure. He did not doubt but that Zora had as Vitious Inclinations as her Brother, but yet her Beauty prevail'd over all, and when he represented to himself, her amiable Person, nothing would serve his turn, but the enjoyment of that, at what rate soever, upon which he was fully bent, though not at so dear a rate, as to be tyed to her in Matrimony. He went to bed also in those thoughts, and in a design to obey her Summons the next morning. Cara in the Morning came to Aladin's house, where he was examin'd by Zora , whether he had been the day before to visit her; for that she having been busied that day more than ordinary, in assisting Roxana's Mother to put up those things which Aladin had left behind him, and to send them away, he might have been there, and not see her. Cara , to take from her all distrust of his knowing any thing of the Mufti's late attempt, did tell her, that earnest business having call'd him elsewhere, he had been defective in that duty, for which he came to beg her pardon, and know what was her pleasure with him. She told him that there was nothing more in it, than to know why he had been defective in performing the promise which he had made her of daily visiting her. I would add , continu'd Zora, that peradventure, I thought it long since I had seen you, but that I fear you would take advantage of it. Yes, Madam , replyed Cara, I would, and do so; and I now most earnestly beg that you would be so just to your self and me, as immediately to appoint the happy moment in which I am to dye in your embraces; the time you had taken for it, is expired: and if you would not have me to dye for love, presently at your feet, my dear Zora, speak that happy moment. You are in haste, it seems , replyed Zora? Yes, Madam , answered Cara; and I had already designed to wait on you, to demand the performance of your word, before I receiv'd your Commands; because I know not whether I shall be oblig'd to attend your Brother, the Mufti, in his journey after the Court, which sets forth to morrow. Well , replyed Zora, you shall prevail; but remember your promise; at twelve this Night come into that Chamber where Aladin used sometimes to lye, when here, by the door of the Gallery, which shall be left open, and there I shall be ready to receive you; but be sure, you let no body see you, and that you make no noise. I know the Chamber , replied Cara, and I shall fly to your embraces as a miserable Slave would do to his unhop'd for Freedom . This bargain made, they confirm'd it with kisses, and so parted till the appointed time. Roxana having had a very restless night, being affrighted with horrid Dreams, did resolve not to lye any longer in her own Chamber, at least for a while, till her mind were more quiet: wherefore, so soon as she was up, she order'd that all things should be remov'd from her Chamber, that she should want, into that in which her Father us'd to sleep, as being more remote from noise, and that the sight of those places in her own Room, in which she had been so highly offended, might not affect her Imagination with such fancies as she had had the last night. This removal being come to Zora's ears, she presently sent a Messenger to the Mufti , to inform him of it; and another to Cara , with a Letter, in which she let him know that it having been Roxana's pleasure to change Chambers with her for a night or two, because she slept not well in her own; that she sent him that timely notice of it, that in lieu of her own Chamber, he should go further into Roxana's Chamber, still by the Gallery door, where he should find his Zora . But the time seeming long to Cara till night, he was gone out on visits, to divert himself, and make the time less tedeous; so that the Letter was left to be given him with a Servant of his, who forgeting to deliver it at his coming home: Cara was by that means left wholly ignorant of the change. The Messenger who had been sent to the Mufti had had better success, he had deliver'd the Letter into the Mufti's own hands, had waited for an answer, which he brought back to Zora , with the ingredient which she was to mix in Roxana's Coffee. All things did thus tend little by little towards their determination on the three Lovers accounts, who were all very impatient of the arrival of the happy moment in which they were to consummate their Joyes; but above all did the Mufti grow impatient, when he receiv'd a Summons from the Council, to give his attendance there forthwith, to deliberate of the measures that should be taken to keep the discontented and murmuring People quiet, during the absence of the Court: the Business being of very great concern, required also a long and vigorous debate about the means that were best to be us'd: the Council on this business was divided, and every one, according as his own particular Interest guided him, gave his voice for this or that way, Our Mufti did all he could possible to bring things to a conclusion, but could not prevail; he had divers times made offers to retire, (it growing towards the hour of his assignation) but had been oblig'd as often to sit down again, by Amurat's Command; at last, the Council having made an end of the business in hand, broke up, and our Mufti was let loose to his own desires; he made all the haste that he could possible to his own Lodgings, to accommodate himself a little fit for the great Work he had in hand, but the hour appointed being already come, he made all the haste imaginable towards Aladin's House. Cara had not fail'd to come at the critical minute to enjoy his dear Zora , who having before hand taken all her measures with the Mufti , so that he was not to see her any more that night, but go directly to find Roxana in Aladin's Chamber, she had retir'd her self in Roxana's Chamber, in expectation of her dear Cara's coming. Cara having got into the House by the back door, which answered to the Gallery, he had pull'd it close after him, and it being a spring-Lock, it had shut of it self; he address'd his steps towards Aladin's Chamber, as he had been directed, and coming to the door, which he found upon the Latch, he open'd it, went in, shut it again, undress'd himself, and went to bed to his Mistress Zora , as he suppos'd. He began his Caresses, and whisper'd fine things in her Ear; but finding no return, neither in word, nor in actions, and perceiving that she was so fast asleep, that all he said or did could not awake her, he concluded that Zora did observe that silence, either to prevent him from making a noise, or that it was in point of modesty; wherefore he troubled himself no further, but fell about the business that he was come for: he was strangely surpriz'd in several respects. He found not that complyance and complaisance which he with reason did expect from Zora ; on the contrary, he met with a kind of repulse and opposition, which though not very vigorous and strong, was continual, and which came from the person, as if it design'd a more the person, as if it design'd a more vigorous resistance, had she not been overcome by a profound sleep, which was accompanied with a louder voice than was requisite to be heard at such a time, and which was so forc'd and inarticulate, as those persons that in their Dreams offer to speak, but cannot; but that which surprised him above all, was to find that which he least expected, namely, a Virgin: he left making reflections till another time, and as he had done the business he was come about, and finding the person, whoe'er it was, to awaken more and more, so that she began to cry out, he hastned all he could to slip on his cloaths, and to get away in all diligence, for fear of any surprizal; but being very desirous to know with whom he had had to do, he had slipp'd a Ring off the Person's Finger, which he took along with him; he presently got to the door he had come in at, and getting into a Court-yard, through which he was to pass before he came to the Street, there he espied a Person muffled up, who turn'd aside, as having no desire to be known, he passed by, and went his way home, contented with his present good fortune, and wonderfully surpris'd at his good success. The Person that Cara had seen in the Court was the Mufti , who having found the door shut, had walk'd up and down there, in hopes it should be open'd to him. The desire he had of concealing himself, and the haste which Cara had made away, had hindred the Mufti from perceiving who it was; he went in, and being got into the Gallery, he found Zora very much disorder'd, who was running for help, who told him that Roxana was waken'd in a strange disorder, that through some dream, or the effects of what had bin given her; she talk'd very loud of strange things, and that certainly she would make some strange discovery, of what had passed betwixt them, if he found not some present expedient to allay the Fury she was in. What dost thou mean , replyed the Mufti, I rather think that thou art mad, or thou wouldst never have left me till now, dancing attendance in the Court. Why , replyed Zora, have you not been with her? No , replyed the Mufti, how could I, when the door (which you said should be open,) was shut; but some body else, more happy than I, has gathered the Fruit, is likely, of all my Labors. Yes , continued he, I had a glimps of him as he run by me, and I very much fancy it was Cara. Has he been with you this Night. No ; replyed Zora, I can assure you . While they were thus examining one another, they heard a noise, which obliged the Mufti to retreat the same way he had come in. He was no sooner got out, but that Zora returning back upon her steps, perceiv'd Roxana coming towards her in the greatest disorder imaginable; she had misplac'd all her Garments about her, and they were so loose put on, that they were ready to drop off, her Hair were about her head, her Eyes look'd as a person's that is in drink, she reel'd and stagger'd much after the same manner, and her words came from her, much with the same difficulty, as persons in drink bring them forth, and but with little or no more Sense; in her hand she had a naked Scimiter, which at the sight of Zora, she lifted up, And have I found thee, thou Robber of my Honour , said she, then there is for thee , with that she discharg'd as great a blow with the Scimiter upon Zora , as her weakness would permit her to give, which Zora prevented from lighting upon her head, by receiving it upon her Arm, which was cut to the bone; Zora staid not for another blow, but presently run away, and lock'd her self up in her own Chamber, barricadoing the door within side, with all that she could find. It being yet very Early, so that she found no body about the House, she went rummaging on, still crying out, where is the Thief, where is the Ravisher, where is that Devil who has depriv'd me of my Jewel? I must have it again, I must find it, nay, I will have it, I'll to the Emperor, and make my moan to him, sure he will redress me; all this she said, going up and down and striking with the Scimiter as she went along; this noise awaken'd at last some of the Women, who wondring what was the matter, hearing Roxana's Voice, stepp'd out to see, but so soon as she espyed the first, running at her as well as she could, the Woman made her escape into Roxana's Mother's Chamber, where having shut her self in, she told the Mother what she had seen. Roxana , with the haste she had made, running after the Woman had fallen down, and could not get up again, which made some other Women with the Mother, who had been awaken'd at the allarm, to venture upon her, and having taken by force the Scimiter from her, they took her up, defending themselves as well as they could from her Teeth and Nails, and conveyd her to her Mother's Bed, being the nearest at hand, where she was forc'd to be held with meer strength of Arms. After the Mother had a little recollected her self, she caus'd some body to go call Zora to her; the Messengers were knocking at the door till they were weary, without any answer, which made them look through the Key-hole, and by an imperfect dim light, it being yet early, having perceiv'd her fallen on the ground, and a great deal of Blood about her, they hastily run back to the Mother, and told her that Zora lay murthered on the Floor, in her own Chamber, and that the Door being lock'd within side, there was no coming at her. The Mother did presently give order that the Door should be broke open, that to that purpose some men servants should be call'd up, as also to be sent for some Physitians in all haste; all was done accordingly, and Zora was found coming to her self again; for the loss of Blood, which had caus'd her fainting, in which she had fallen on the Floor, being thereby stopt for the present, she had come to life again; those that were about her stopp'd the blood, and bound up the Wound as well as they could, till further help came. She was asked who had done her the mischief? and the question being made by those that were inferior to her, she thought not fit to give them any account of it, but wav'd the Discourse. Roxana , in the mean time, having amongst the rest of her extravagant talk, mention'd the Mufti's Name two or three times. The Mother having given strict Charge she should be held in her Bed, did go to Zora's Chamber, to see her, and to ask her some questions. She asked of her, in the first place, who had so wounded her , to which Zora made answer, that having heard a great noise in the Womens apartment, she had stepped out of her Chamber to see what was the matter, and that as she was returning, she had met with Roxana, who calling her Robber and Thief, had given her that blow with a Scimiter that she had in her hand, at which she had run away, and locked her self in her Chamber, for fear she should follow after her, to give her more . The Mother asked her, whether the Mufti her Brother, had been there that day , to which Zora made answer, No. Are you very sure of that , said the Mother, Yes, Madam , answered Zora, and I am certain, that no body in all the House can say he has been seen by them this day. He may have been here, and you not know it , reply'd the Mother. No, Madam, answered Zora, I can, and will give you ample proof of what I say. And pray, Madam , continued she, because my Wound will not permit me to write, call but for some body that can, and I will send the Mufti word, that he should give us an exact account of the places and Company he has been with all the Day, and all the night . A person being brought, Zora bid him only write, justifie your self, and give good proofs where you have been of late . This was presently sent by Zora's special order, to her Brother, who was found in his Bed. By this time the Surgeons being come, they took Zora in hand, and dressed her Wound. No sooner did the Mufti read that note, but he presently got up, though it was so early, and he began his Certificate, which was, that having been at the Council till past twelve of the Clock, he had from thence gone home, from whence he had not since stirr'd out. This was sign'd by all his Servants. Of truth there was but one, who knew of his going out, who was his Confident, the others believing really that he had not been out that night. So soon as it was convenient for him to stir forth, he went to divers of the Counsellors, and obtain'd from them their hands to certifie, that he had been with them in the Council Chamber, till after twelve, telling them, to satisfie their Curiosity, that a wager depended upon it; after that he went to all the other places where he had been all that day, and obtain'd from those Persons in whose Company he had been, to sign to his Certificate, which he sent back to Zora . He thought this a very necessary thing for him to do out of hand, because the Court was moving that day, towards the Holy Waters, that he might be so far justified to the World, that he should not in his absence be accused of a deed, which he verily believ'd was done, but knew not by whom, and had no hand in it, with hopes, that at his return, he might renew his Friendship with Roxana , who still stuck at his heart, though he believ'd her ravish'd. Thus he fitted himself for the Journey, and went with the Court. The Physitians having administer'd things to Roxana , in order to compose her Spirits, and to cause her to rest. The Scimiter was examin'd, and no body could imagine how Roxana came by it, nor any body remember that they had seen such a one in the House: But when Zora had view'd it a little more nearly, she fancy'd that Cara did wear just such a one, which confirm'd her in the suspicion she had before, that Cara had come, and taking one Room for another, had met with Roxana , while she her self had been disappointed. The Mother not knowing what to think of all this, nor what to make of it, began to wish her self in the Country with her Husband, or he with her at Constantinople , to dive a little deeper than she could in all these Mysteries, and to unravel the Riddles. Cara , for his part, having got by his change, was well satisfied, fancying that it was with Roxana that he had met in the dark, in lieu of Zora , of which he hoped to be one day fully satisfyed, by the Ring which he had taken from off her Finger; nothing did trouble him in all this business, but the loss of his Scimiter, which he knew not whether he had dropt by the way, or left behind him, through his extreme haste to get away unseen, which he had almost despair'd to do, by the great noise which Roxana began to make. By this time of the day, the Emperour and the Sultana were ready to go their Journey, accompanied with the principal Officers of the Court, not forgetting our Mufti amongst the rest. Not but that he would fain have lingred behind for some few days, to have learn'd, of certain, who had been his Substitute, of which he had but a bare distrust, and to have had some account of Roxana's condition. But the Emperour calling particularly for him, he was forc'd to go, and leave all to Zora's care, which was to send him word how things were; but he resolv'd to take Cara along with him, to prevent him from any further progress in his good fortune with Roxana , under the pretence of having then more opportunity to present him to Amurat , and to get him some employ. Roxana , who was all this while in her Mother's bed, had at last fallen asleep, and by the assistance of those Remedies which had been administred to her, all that had pass'd, that had been done to her, or that she had acted, did appear as a Vision; and had she not found in her self so great a change, which of necessity did perswade her that there was but too much reality in the case, all had pass'd with her for a Dream. She still insisting on the Mufti's violence to her, Zora gave Roxana's Mother that Certificate which her Brother had sent, and the Mother having read it, she gave it to Roxana , who having examin'd the Witnesses names over and over, could not but be satisfi'd in that respect, not doubting, but all those hands were true: the Mufti , as wicked as he was, not daring to counterfeit so many Privy Councellors hands, which would of necessity have risen up in judgment against him, and have declar'd him a person not fit to live. Thus was Roxana still in the dark, as to the knowledge of her Ravisher; but though she found that the Mufti was not the immediate Person, she suspected that it was his, and his Sister's contrivance and design, but that by some strange accident some other person had made use of an opportunity which Fortune had presented to them. She enquir'd what was become of the Scimiter, with which she had wounded Zora , and desir'd to see it: it was brought to her, and she neither knew how she had come by it, nor whose it might be; she only learn'd that no body in all the Family could remember to have seen such a one in all the House: and Zora did believe that she came out of Aladin's Chamber with it. Roxana laid up the Scimiter safe, that when time should serve, she might make what use she could of it, in order to some discovery. Presently after, calling for water to wash her hands, she miss'd the Ring off of her Finger; she said nothing of that, but would go her self into Aladin's Chamber, to seek after it; being got thither, she caus'd all that had come with her to retire; she lock'd her self in, and left no corner unsearch'd, both for the Ring, and the Scimiter's Scabbard, but to no purpose; she then considered how all things lay in that Chamber, the great disorder the bed- cloths were in; and prying a little further, she perceiv'd some signs of the violence which had been us'd against her; whence she concluded, that whoever it was that had been there, he had designdly taken her Ring away, but left the Scimiter by accident, with haste to get away unseen. After this, she concluded that something had been given her, to cast her in a Sleep or Trance, that she might not make that noise and resistance which they might expect she would have done; and who could do all this without Zora's privacy? Then remembring that she had complain'd to her of an odd taste in the last Coffee she took at night, that confirm'd her still more in the belief that all had been acted by Zora , with a design to assist her Brother in the pursuit of his first Design, of getting from her by force, what he could not obtain by fair means, but that he being detain'd about some other Concerns, some other Person more fortunately had met with what the Mufti had so long sought for, and had made use of the fair opportunity that presented it self to him, not troubling himself who was the Person; and that as a great argument that she conjectur'd right, it was observable, that no body but her Mother and Zora did know of her lying in Aladin's Chamber that night, where she had never lain before. Roxana having made those, and divers other reflections, she return'd to her Mother's Chamber, where she declar'd all that had happen'd to her, and all the surmisals that she had made upon the business; concluding, that seeing of necessity, Zora must be the principal Instrument in all the business of her ruine, she would never see her Face more, no more than her Brother, the wicked Mufti ; and she earnestly begg'd of her Mother to advise Zora to retire from their House, because she had conceiv'd a prejudice against her, which would hinder her perfect recovery by the sight of her. The Mother did speak to Zora about it, and Zora knowing her self guilty, and that Roxana was very like to revenge her self on her, in the absence of her Brother, she stay'd not to be bid to go twice; and that very day, she retir'd to the House of a Relation of hers, and Roxana liv'd with her Mother a more retir'd life than ever: all her diversion being in walking sometimes in her Garden, sitting a while in the Summer-house, and the rest of her time she spent in Sighs and Tears, in her own Chamber and Closet. The Court had not been gone a Month, but that a Rumor run about every where, that the Sultana was with Child; and there were divers persons that did not stick to affirm, and offer to lay wagers that it was of a young Prince. This made all the Bassa's and other Grandees of the Port, and of the Empire, who were not of the Sect of Hali to look about them; they had very well inform'd themselves of the Emperor and the Sultana's Phisicians, that she could not bring forth a living Child, which made them conclude that these Rumors were spread abroad but to feel the pulse of the People, and to find how it would be resented by those that were more particularly concern'd in the business. Presently a private Messenger was sent to Prince Soliman , of that wicked practice against his right to the Succession of the Empire. He was of the blood of the Ottomans , had married Zelinda , the Eldest of the two Daughters which Amurat had had by a former Sultana , who was of the true ancient Religion of Mahomet , and who had had her Children educated the same way. The youngest had been married to another Prince, of the same Religion also. The Prince return'd them thanks for the timely advice which they had given him; and he further desir'd them to continue their good will towards him, in giving him from time to time, such intelligences and advices as might conduce to their own good as well as his, assuring them that he would stand by them against all Attempts which should be made against their Religion, Laws, and Liberties. This answer was so agreeable to their Wishes, which they receiv'd from Prince Solyman , that it did not only revive their drooping Spirits, but set them all to work themselves, and, by Spyes upon Amurat , and the Sultana's Person, to find out all that they could of their designs against the Empire, and they at last found that Cha-Abas the Persian Emperor had so poison'd the Sultana's mind by divers rich Presents, great assurances of his Aid and Succor in the great Work of Reformation (as he call'd it,) and the continual Solicitations of his Pensioners, and Emissaries in the Ottoman Empire, that they no longer doubted of their designed ruine, and that they were sold with the Empire to Cha-Abas's Ambition. They gain'd some of the Ladies of the Mahometan Religion, whose places oblig'd them to be constantly near the Sultana in the Seraglio , to observe her exactly, and to give them from time to time, what reports they could, concerning her feigned pregnancy. The Emperor and the Sultana , having finished their Pilgrimage and Devotions, the Court return'd to Constantinople with great joy, the Emperor and Sultana declaring publickly that she was with Child; for which, great joy was expressed amongst all the Followers of the Sect of Haly , and our Mufti was none of the backwardest in proclaiming the wonderful Miracle. But that did not hinder him from minding his own concerns, and learning the reasons of Zora's coming away from Aladin's Family. She told him all that she did know, and all that had passed in his absence, but she did not know how the Certificate which he had sent, was taken, because that she had gone from thence that very day. She after that asked him news concerning Cara , he told her that he had for her sake, got him the Command of a Galley, and that he was gone to enter upon it, that after that he would return to Constantinople. With this story he pleased her for the present. Of truth he had procured him that Command, but it had been with a design to keep him at Sea, far from Constantinople ; and from attempting to get hereafter, by fair means, from Roxana , what he believ'd meer Fortune had thrown into his Arms; for notwithstanding all these Frowns of Fortune on his amorours designs, he doubted not but to succeed in time, and to obtain from Roxana now, what she so positively refus'd him before, being of Opinion that she would not think her self for the Future so oblig'd, as she was before her Rape, to preserve that which was not of so much value, how highly soever he did still value it himself. The Mufti did make strict inquiries after Roxana's Health, and divers offers to visit her, but all to no purpose; he address'd himself to the Mother, who receiv'd him very Civilly, and did express so much satisfaction in his Conversation, that he continu'd his Visits to her, not without hopes to make her in time an Instrument for his access to his beloved Roxana . He was not long without solliciting the Mother on that account, but still she wav'd the Discourse, and put it off, not without being offended in her self, at the slight the Mufti made of her Company, in so earnestly pressing for her Daughter, while she believed her self more suitable in Age for his grave conversation, than Roxana was. But the Mufti at last growing quite weary of the Mother's company, which made him to slacken his Visits, she was oblig'd to make him a Promise, that she would speak to Roxana about him, to keep him still to her. That made him to repeat his Visits more frequently again, but still more to solicite and press the Mother to obtain leave of her Daughter, that he might see her, than for any diversion which he could please himself with, in the Mothers Company; however he appear'd as complaisant towards her as he could force himself to represent, and he did so press the Mother to the performance of her promise, that she was at last forc'd to speak to Roxana about it. Roxana did not only receive with all the coldness imaginable what she said, but took upon her to reprimand her Mother for engaging her self in so fowl a business, declaring once for all, that if she would not let her be quiet at Constantinople , where she remained meerly in complaisance to her, and without any the least inclination of her own, she would immediately write to her Father, to send for her into the Country. This answer made the Mother mute for ever after in the Mufti's concerns, and rather than to be mew'd up again as she had formerly been, in the Country, (which she fear'd would happen but too soon,) she resolv'd to lose one Courtier, in the person of the Mufti , to preserve all the rest that address'd themselves to her. She therefore told the Mufti ; that she had us'd all her endeavours to perswade her Daughter, but all to no purpose, she being so wedded to her deep Melancholy of late, that she abhorred all manner of Conversation. This made our Mufti to withdraw himself in a short time after from the Mother's Coversation also, though not to desist from his amorous pursuit of Roxana . Great rejoycings were at Court for the Sultana's pregnancy, Cha-Abas fail'd not to send an Ambassador to Congratulate the Emperor and Sultana about it. And at last the time came of the Sultana's quickning, those news redoubled the joys of the Halists , insomuch, that they no longer doubted of a Successor to the Empire, that should be of their Sect, and that consequently would preserve that Religion in the Empire. Mean time the true Mahometists , who were all disgraciated, and laid aside from all Offices of Trust, and publick Employes, were very diligent in their enquiry into things, and they had a very great progress in the discovery of Cha-Abas's designs, but they thought it not time yet to shew the least sign of their knowledge; that did so perswade the Halists , that they were possest with a Spirit of stupidity, and that they were wholly depriv'd of all Sense and foresight of their Misery at hand, that they set the less guard on their Actions, and acted so visibly their wicked Designs, that they became obvious to the very Vulgar Eyes. But amongst all those rejoycings, care was taken to distance from Constantinople , all such Persons as were to be concern'd in prying more narrowly into the Birth of the Pretended Child, than were consistent with the Halists Designs. Wherefore some were confin'd to their Country Houses; some few, who had yet some Governments of Provinces, were charg'd not to stir from thence without special orders from the Emperor; others were sent in Embassy. Amurat's youngest Daughter was sent by the forc'd Advice of her Physicians, to some Baths of warm Waters, at a great distance from Constantinople , in order to recover that health, of which she found no want. In fine, all but the Mufties of the true Mahometan Religon, were dispers'd far enough from offering to prye into the grand Secrets of the Court. But those Mufties were to be dispos'd of also: Our Mufti was employ'd particularly in that work, he invented a Paper , which he caus'd Amurat to proclaim, was his pleasure, should be read in all the Mosqu ees in his Dominions, which was so much against the formal Laws of the Empire, and of such dangerous Consequences to the true Mahometan Religion, that the Mufties unanimously declin'd the reading of them, in their respective Mosqu ees , only some few that were Temporisers, did sacrifice to their Interest and Ambition, the true Dictates of their own Consciences. This was sufficient matter to bring those refusing Mufties into Examination, they were examin'd before Amurat , and notwithstanding all that they did alledge of just and honest, in vindication of their Innocence from the aspersion of Disobedience, and Rebellion, with which they were charg'd, they were all sent Prisoners to the Tower of the Dardanelles . As this Confinement of the Mufties did highly rejoice the Halists , which did all conclude from thence, a sudden fall of the Mahometan Religion, to the Elevation of theirs, so it did raise such fears and apprehensions in the true Mahometists , that they began to provide with more vigour than ever, though underhand, against the Fatal stroke, which was ready to fall upon their Religion, Rights, and Lives. They sent Messengers to Prince Solyman , to intreat him to be in a readiness to defend his own Right, and the Laws of the Empire. He hearken'd to their advices, and made Preparations underhand to assist those of his own Religion, and to free them from Persian slavery. Thus were all Parties busie in supporting and promoting their own interest, by all means imaginable. The one pufft up with great hopes, and the other as much abased with fears and apprehensions. Roxana was not without a very great increase of trouble on her part, notwithstanding the general rejoicing of all those of her own Sect. She had felt some motions in her Belly, which she was not accustom'd to feel, which with some sick fits, that had lately come upon her, had made her to give her Mother an account of the whole; her Mother did presently Judge by what her Daughter had told her, and by some other Circumstances and Signs, that Roxana had not only been ravish'd, but that she had been got with Child also; She confirm'd her Daughter in those Suspicions that she had of it, and the knowledge of that further mischief did wholly cast down Roxana , so that from that time she confin'd her self entirely to her Chamber, and would not admit but one from amongst all her Servants, in which she most confided, to approach near her, or to see her. Our Mufti was not satisfied with applauding himself, with his late invention, wherewith he had entrapp'd his great Enemies, the Mufties of the true Mahometan Religion (as he deem'd them) but he would be prais'd for it likewise by all his Party, not sparing Amurat and the Sultana from acknowledging his Subtilty in the managing of that branch of the great work. To this purpose he went to pay his devoirs to the Sultana , who he had not seen since that great Exploit: She fail'd not to magnifie his ingenuity, and to praise his indefatigable Industry in the propagation of the Faith: after which falling on particular discourses, the Sultana ask'd him what was become of Roxana and her Mother? saying that she had not seen them, nor heard of them since her return, and that she had expected a congratulatory visit from them for her great belly. The Mufti glad that the Sultana had fallen on that Theam of her self, made answer, that he had heard by accident, that they were still both in Town, but that his multiplicity of business had hindred him from making any further enquiry about them. The Sultana said that she had a desire to see the Beauteous, and Ingenious Roxana again; and with that order'd that a Messenger should be immediately sent from her, to the Mother and Daughter, to command them to wait on her that very day. The Messenger deliver'd the Message to Roxana's Mother, but did not come to the speech of her; and all that her Mother could say or do, after the Messenger was gone (to whom she had said, they both would obey the Sultana's obliging Commands) she could not prevail with her to keep her Company. What will the Sultana think , said the Mother? What shall I say? What excuse shall I make ? All that Roxana said, was, what you please, use your own discretion, and act according to your own fancy . The Mother was forc'd to go to the Seraglio without Roxana , very much dissatisfied, and very full of thoughts, what she should tell the Sultana , and whether she had best to discover to her what misfortunes had hapned to Roxana , or not: She left all to the conduct of Fortune, and resolv'd to discover, or keep secret according as the Sultana would give her occasion to act. She was kindly receiv'd by the Sultana , who presently ask'd after Roxana. Is she sick , said the Sultana? Yes, Madam , reply'd the Mother; she is not well, nor very sick neither. What Riddle is this , reply'd the Sultana? Pray unfold it . At this, the Mother, who had much to do to retain her Tears, and in whose Face the Sultana had observ'd great marks of Sorrow, could no longer contain her self: She gave her Eyes liberty to dischage themselves upon her Cheeks, which so sensibly mov'd the Sultana , that she once again bid her to let her know what was the cause of so great a Sorrow as she express'd? assuring her, that nothing should be wanting to give her comfort. My Griefs are of that nature, Madam , reply'd the Mother, that they will not admit of any Redress. I must rest satisfy'd in letting you know them, without any hopes of Comfort, neither from you, nor any body else in the World, continu'd she. But, Madam, since it is your pleasure to hear my sorowful Story, be pleas'd, at least, to afford me your Pity . With that she told the Sultana all that had happen'd to Roxana , since the Court's removal and return. This is very ill for poor Roxana, said the Sultana, the rather, because that there is no means left to know her Ravisher, who, though I do not believe to be designedly so, yet deserv'd some punishment, for using so ill the opportunity which he had of serving poor Roxana in a nobler way; at least, if he were a person sutable to her rank, he should be compell'd to marry her, or I should lose my Interest with Amurat. But though I cannot redress your Griefs according to my own desires, in some measure I will alleviate them, and render them somewhat more easie for you both to bear. Does any body know of Roxana's misfortune , added the Sultana? No, Madam, not any one, I can assure you; for she has not seen the Fate of any person since; nor could I so much as prevail with her to wait upon you, Madam: I cannot deny, but that Zora , Mufti Repset's Sister, may suspect something of the business, as having had a hand in it on the Mufti's account, so far as his design went. That's nothing , reply'd the Sultana: They are both of the Cabal, in which I now will joyn you and Roxana, as being persons that may be of great use to me in carrying on the great design. But you must be all secret, not a whisper, or a betraying look, or all is lost. Madam, you may command our Lives , reply'd the Mother; we should go to our deaths without murmuring, if it were to serve you. I believe you, and thank you , reply'd the Sultana. Know now, that for the good of our Cause, and the Glory of the Sect of our great Prophet Haly, it has been thought fit by our Privy Council, that I should feign to be with Child; and it has been so given out already, to be about that very time in which Roxana was made so in effect. There are some Women that have prov'd pregnant about that time also, who have Spies upon them, to observe whether they will have a Boy at the time of their delivery, that I may be supply'd with a Male Child, when my feigned time of deliverance is accomplish'd: now if Roxana's Child proves to be a Son, nothing would be more conformable to my desires, than to have it to pass for a Prince. Tell Roxana this from me, that she should continue in her solitary reservedness still on this account, and that when the business is over, I shall take care to provide for her according to her quality and merits; mean time , continu'd she, give her this from me, with an assurance of my special favour : With that, she gave her a rich Jewel, and so dismiss'd her. The Mother being return'd home, told all the whole Story to Roxana , who being still more and more afflicted at the publishing of her misfortune, did not rejoyce, as her Mother expected, at the Sultana's confidence which she repos'd in them, nor at her kind assurances of favour and protection; on the contrary, she plung'd her self deeper still in Melancholy; so that from that time she continu'd in darkness, admitting of no more light into her Chamber, than what a small dim Taper did afford. The Confinement of the Mufties in the Tower of the Dardanelles , had much disturb'd the whole Party of the true Mahometists ; they had murmur'd aloud, they had acted with more fire than usually, so that it was known that they did expect some assistance from some place, but whence not yet certainly known; and business not being ripe to come to a conclusion, on the Halists party, till the pretended Heir were come into the World, to satisfie the multitude as well as others, and keep them under, till their rising would be to no effect, a day was appointed for bringing the imprison'd Mufties to a publick Examination, to satisfie the true Mahometists , but it was so deferr'd, that it should not be till after the Sultana had been deliver'd of her fictitious great Belly. The time of her delivery at last grew near, according to that reckning which they had given out, but because it did not exactly agree with the true reckoning which Roxana made, or that her Mother made for her, (for she her self minded nothing) another Reckning was set up, and given out, and that being near out also, the Sultana had ordered at what places she would Lye In, which were sometime in one place, sometimes in another; that no body should have any certain knowledge of it, but those who were of the Secret. It was not long after, that Roxana's Mother sent a Letter to the Sultana , to let her know that her Daughter was in her effectual Labour; Orders were presently sent back in a Letter, that she should be brought into the Seraglio, if it were possible to be done with Secresie . But she was so far gone, that it could not be; and she being deliver'd of a Son, the Child, according to the orders that had been given, was secretly convey'd to the Seraglio , into that Appartment which the Sultana had last made choice of, there kept by a good Fire in the next Chamber to that appointed for the Sultana's Lying In, and notice presently brought to the Sultana , that every thing was in a readiness. The Sultana did presently get her self carried to that Apartment by some of her Attendants, and put into her Bed, the Midwife and all the rest of the Confederacy at hand. Amurat had notice given that the Sultana was in Labour, and he sent to his late Brother's Sultana , and to divers others of the Sect of Hali , instantly to repair to that Appartment, to which the Sultana had been newly transported, there presently was a considerable appearance at the appointed place, of such as were of the Sect of Hali , except two or three at the most of old true Mahometists , who being held in Discourse by Amurat at the Beds feet, the Curtains being shut close round the Bed, so that nothing was to be seen, and scarce heard, for the Sultana not being accustomed to those sorts of Pageantry, she could not bring her self to cry out with that vigour and strength that acute Pains cause Women to do; but however the Child being conveyed into the Bed by a by door, which was at the inward side or Ruel of the Bed, (to which they had given some small thing to cause it to sleep, for fear that it should cry out and discover all) A little while after the Midwife pulls it out of the Bed lapped up in warm Cloths, put it into her lap, and conveyed her self and it into the next Room, through the same by-door, not declaring what it was that she had got, but presently after it was told to Amurat , who spoke it to the Company, rejoycing mightily at it. Thus was Roxana's Child us'd to substitute an Heir to the Empire, that might be brought up in the Sect of Hali , to the prejudice of Zelinda , who was the true and undoubted Heir apparent, only because she was of the true Mahometan Religion. The News of a new born Prince being spread abroad, it afforded new Subject of great Joy, to all those of the Sect of Hali ; amongst the rest of their demonstrations of joy, there was a Fire-work, which was so great, and so curiously contriv'd, that it seem'd as if those Fusees of which it was compos'd, were flying up, with a design to consume the Region of Fire, to burst in pieces the Thunderbolts, to fire Lightning, and to allarm the very Stars. Presently were seen Ambassadours from all parts, amongst which, one from Cha-Abas was not the last to compliment the Emperour and Sultana on the birth of the young Prince. But now that so much of the great work was done; that which remained yet undone, was to be thought of. Roxana remain'd still unconsolable, insomuch that she never made any enquiry after her Child, whether it was dead or alive; neither did she take such care of her self as she ought to do; but that was her Mother's part, of which she acquitted her self as she ought to do. The Cabinet Council thought fit to have Roxana convey'd out of the way, lest that, having been made privy to the Plot, at some time or other she should in one of her melancholick fits discover the whole mistery: and the Mufti Repset was appointed to perform that pious piece of work. He undertook the business, but it was not till after he had attempted and try'd all the ways and means imaginable to reclaim Roxana out of her deep melancholy, and to bring her to give an ear to his addresses; but finding all to be labour in vain, he on the sudden converted all his former Love into Hatred; insomuch that he did not only contrive her Confinement in some place in Persia , but he charg'd those who were appointed to guard her, and convey her to the Galley that should transport her, with Letters which contain'd, that that Person should be receiv'd , meaning Roxana, into the Order to which she was directed; and that after she had been brought by hardship to a severe penance, she should be sent into another World by the means of some gentle Poison . And that the Mufti should not be wanting in the least in his revenge, he directed her to be privately convey'd into that Galley which was commanded by Cara ; that he whom he believ'd to be Roxana's innocent Ravisher, should have a hand in her death. Thus Roxana was sent away incognito , to her own ruine, under the pretence of change of Air, for her health sake. All this while Aladin had been kept in ignorance of all that had pass'd at his House in Constantinople , and as oft as he had sent for leave of the Emperour to come up to Constantinople , he still had been deny'd by our Mufti's contrivances: but so soon as Roxana was sent away, he had liberty sent him to come to Constantinople . The Sultana having accidentally had some intelligence of our Mufti's cruelty against poor Roxana , to whom she had promis'd her protection, gave private notice to Roxana's Mother, that there was a Letter sent with her, which was to be deliver'd to the Captain of the Galley, which he was not to open, but to deliver it as it was to those persons to whom he was to deliver Roxana ; which Letter contain'd orders for Roxana's death. And she advis'd the Mother to send immediately an express after Roxana , to give her private notice thereof in writing. The Mother lost no time, and the Messenger came just as Roxana was getting into the Galley. Cara having receiv'd his order, and, by the retinue, believing his Charge to be some person of quality, who desir'd to remain conceal'd, he shew'd her to the best Cabbin, without any further inquiry who this person should be; and of truth, there was no body there that could inform him: for at Roxana's departure from Constantinople , all her own Servants had been discharg'd, and new ones, which she had never seen before, were appointed to wait on her that Journey. Thus was poor, unfortunate Roxana doom'd to death, and sent to it by him who had been the chief cause of her greatest sorrow. But the Heavens, who permit sometimes Wickedness to triumph over Innocence and Virtue for a while, will not rest till they have brought the Wicked to Punishment, not permitting Goodness to be always oppress'd, as we shall see in the continuation of Roxana's Story. The great rejoycing which the Halists made for their young Heir to the Empire, did but the more incense those of the true Mahometan Religion, who were highly disturb'd already at the imprisoning of their Mufties , and they murmur'd openly at it, which caus'd that the Halists , who had now no further occasion for their Confinement, at least for the present, did release them, after a kind of Examination, which was more for Form, than any thing that could with Justice be alledg'd against them. But more Severity than ever was us'd against all true Mahometists ; and the Halists were so full of the designs which they had of suddenly destroying them, that they could not forbear their open threatnings. Of truth, it was discover'd that there was an agreement made betwixt Amurat's Council and Cha-Abas to destroy all such as would not become Halists ; and to that purpose, Cha-Abas was to send a Persian Army into the Ottoman Empire, which was to assist the Halists in their wicked designs, to totally root out the True, Ancient Mahometan Religion, to destroy all the maintainers thereof with Fire and Sword, and to clear the whole Empire of that Religion The Blow was ready to be given, when that all the Nobility of the Ancient and True Religion of Mahomet , made an association amongst themselves, to stand and fall one by another, for the maintenance of their Religion, and the preservation of the fundamental Laws of the Empire. This they signed, and sent over to Prince Soliman , by a particular Messenger, with Letters to humbly intreat him to defer no longer his coming to redeem them from Slavery and Idolatry; that now the Persian Sword was ready to fall upon their Heads, and that if he stay'd any longer from giving them assistance, that in their ruine he would meet with an end to all his just pretensions to the Succession of the Empire. Soliman , who had had sure intelligences from all hands of Cha-Abas designs, that knew that he would no sooner have done with the Ottoman Empire, but that he would be for divesting of him also, of his Dominions, did presently march at the head of a great Army, into the Ottoman Territories; where being come, and not finding the Bassa's to joyn with him, as they had assur'd him they would do, he was thinking of retiring again, knowing well, that how great soever his Army was, it was very insufficient to oppose Amurat's Forces, so long as they remain'd united; but he was not long in that suspense, for so soon as the Nobles had conveniences, they all came over with their men to him, who being so strongly reinforc'd, and Amurat's Army so weaken'd, or rather entirely ruined, he march'd streight-way towards Constantinople , without the least considerable resistance, all places yielding to him as he march'd. This sudden and unexpected Change in the Halists Affairs, did so surprise them, that every one of them began to shift for themselves, amongst which, the Priests of every order of Hali's Sect, were not the last. Amurat himself, seeing what a prodigious Change had happen'd in all his Dominions, thought it necessary to send secretly away, the Sultana with the Child, into Cha- Abas's Dominions, and he himself, did not long after, follow them, resolv'd to deprive himself of the Empire for the good of his Subjects, seeing that the constitution of the Government did not sute with his Religion. It is now time we should return to poor unfortunate Roxana . At her reception into the Galley , through her disorder in getting in, her Vail had fallen so much aside, as to give Cara a sufficient view, to let him know what a Beautiful Person he was intrusted withal. But Roxana was so alter'd from her former condition, by her incessant grief that persons who had more and frequenter opportunities of seeing her, than Cara , would not have known her again; besides, he was far from immagining, that she, who had liv'd all along so retiredly, should be for going into Persia . He had then as much sight of her, as was sufficient to set his heart all on fire, and to create in him an extraordinary desire of seeing more openly that Beauty, and of inquiring who she was. Roxana's thoughts were taken up another way, she sitting alone in her Cabin , had time to run over all her Misfortunes, and to descant upon every particular Circumstance of them. But that which troubled her most in that juncture, was the advice which her Mother had sent her in Writing, concerning the Letter which had been delivered with her into the Captain's hand, in which was written the Sentence of her Death; but no Advice or Counsel had been added to her Mother's Care, how she should avoid or get off that danger. Cara's Love would not let him rest, he took all occasions, and made use of all the opportunities that offered themselves, to shew a more than usual Zeal and Diligence, to serve her personally, thereby both to get another fair sight of her, and to ingratiate himself into her good opinion; of truth, he was so diligent in serving her, beyond that morose way which most of those, who use the Seas, are inclin'd to, that Roxana could not but observe it; and those assiduous Services being seconded with divers Presents of Refreshments, and offers of further Services, Roxana had no longer any place to doubt, but that all was the Effects of her unfortunate beauty, as she us'd to stile it. Upon this Opinion, she began to build some hopes to attain to the knowledge of the Particulars contained in the fatal Letter, whereby she hop'd that she might find out some means to prevent that mischief, which she was going to. To this purpose, she thought that her Beauty, though so much alter'd of late, might much contribute especially towards a person, who she perceiv'd did endeavour by all means imaginable, to see her face wholly unvail'd, she therefore was not long without giving him an opportunity of so doing, but so as if it were by meer accident. She pretended that the want of a free Air in the Cabin, did make her sick, and therefore desired Cara that he would give his Prisoner leave, (as she term'd her self) to take a little Air upon the Deck. That was a Request so suitable to Cara's desires, that he made her this answer. My Prisoner, Madam, said you? I know of no such thing; and if you were so really, you have those Charms about you that will set you free, whenever you desire them to act; be assur'd, Madam , continued he, that I am so far from thinking you a Prisoner, much less of using you like one, that I here offer you all my Services, in any thing that may tend to your satisfaction and content; with that he took her by the hand, and led her upon the most convenient place on the Deck . Where she sate under a large Umbrello, incompassed round with her own Slaves and Servants. The Wind blowing a little fresh, her Vail was disordered by it, she took that opportunity of shewing her self, in pulling it quite off, as she was about setting of it in order again, as if by accident; which causing her to blush, she said to Cara , who stood as if struck with Thunder at the admiration of so much beauty, The very Elements are set against me, they would not else have discovered to you, Sir, that which may hereafter slacken your Civilities towards a Person, that now you will have no longer any Opinion that she deserves them. Cara stood still mute, gazing upon Roxana , though vail'd again, without the power to stir or speak one word. Roxana taking that for a good sign, took the liberty to proceed thus. Cast your Eyes upon some other Object, which may blot out of your imagination those Lines which my deficiency may have traced there, that you may be no longer troubled at your so free offers of Services, to a person so little deserving them; I'll release you of them, Sir. Madam , replyed Cara , who was a little come to himself again, I am so strangely surprised, at what chance joined to my good Fortune has shewn me, that I know not whether I had better wish my self turn'd all into Eyes, to gaze on that Treasure of Beauty I have seen, or into one whole heart to offer at your Feet, as a Sacrifice, though most unworthy to so much perfection. Roxana , finding the Air too cool, arose to retire, Cara accompanying her to her Cabbin. She said, I take, Sir, what you are pleas'd to say to me, as words of course, which your mouth uses to utter, while your heart may have no share at all in them. If ever I was guilty of any such thing, Madam , answered Cara, be assur'd that now what I say, is the pure and sincere Dictates of an heart, that would be too happy to expire in your Service, and that my mouth has no further to do with it, than in obedience to my Heart's commands. Take heed, Sir, that you say , replyed Roxana, you know not to whom you make those fair offers, and what great inducements I may have to take you at your word! You may wonder, and not without cause, at my forwardness, in the acceptance of your Services , continued she, but know, Sir, that those circumstances that I at present lye under, may be of such a nature as may plead my excuse, for a way of proceeding so contrary to the Rules that the most prudent and modest of our Sex do observe. In a word, Sir, I find that I have not too much time left me, to imploy after some means, to preserve my life. Once more, Sir, I tell you that I am your Prisoner, and that you have orders to lead me and to deliver me up to my Executioners. Who I, Madam , replyed Cara, strangely surpris'd, when did I receive such Orders? and from whom? From Mufti Repset, replyed Roxana. It is he who has pronounc'd my Sentence, and that has trusted you with the care of seeing it executed . Riddles, all Riddles to me, Madam, I can assure you , answered Cara, I have no further orders, than to receive you, and your Servants, with your Goods, on board my Vessel, to convey you all to Persia, there to deliver you into the hands of certain Religious Persons, which for their austerity of Lives, and discipline of Religion, are the most unfit Persons that could ever be pitch'd upon, to perform so horrible an Act, as your bare mentioning of makes my very heart to tremble within me . Well, Sir, replyed Roxana , to convince you that I know more of the reach of your Commission, than you know your self, give me leave to tell you, that you have in your power, my Life and Death. Yes, Sir, I know that you have a Letter, in which is contain'd the Decree of my Death, and that in the delivery or retention of that Letter, consists either my happiness or misery. I must confess, Madam, that I have a Letter, answer'd Cara , which I have order to deliver with you into such persons hands as I have mentioned, but what the Contents are, I am wholly ignorant of; only this intimation I have had from the Mufti you mention'd, that it contain'd the Emperor's particular orders, and that therefore I should be very observant in the delivery of it. Well, Sir, replyed Roxana , obey the Order, and deliver me up a Victim to the Mufti's revenge, though you incur the Emperor's displeasure, Who, I am certain, knows nothing of it. The Mufti will reward you one day, for the signal Service you will render him, in the destruction of miserable Roxana . Saying this she let fall a deluge of tears, at which Cara was so wonderfully mov'd, as well as at the name of Roxana , that he had not the power to speak for a considerable time; but at last recollecting himself, Roxana ! repeated he divers times, divine Roxana ! Oh Heav'ns! what turn of Fortune is this? I serve the Mufti in so foul a deed, (for it must needs be true, since Roxana has said it) I serve the Mufti ? nay Amurat himself, against Roxana's Life? May all the Elements contrive my immediate ruine first, and instantly bring it upon me. No, Divine Roxana, continu'd he, casting himself at her feet , Rather than be accessary in any thing that can cause the least trouble to you; nay, rather than not return the Heavens thanks, for having thought me worthy of so great an Honour, as to be instrumental in the preserving of that Charming Creature from all manner of Evil, let my Vessel split, and I be swallowed up immediately into the deep, never to be seen more, so Roxana be but safe. These passionate Expressions, with her Name so frequently repeated, made Roxana to believe that she was known to Cara , though she could not remember that she had ever seen him; it made her put a stop to her Tears, and lifting up her Eyes, to see whether she could call to mind any remembrance of him. You speak, Sir, as if you knew me, at least my Name, said Roxana , and as if you were concern'd more than ordinarily at my misery. Nay, you seem to believe that the Mufti is my Enemy? Your Enemy, Madam, replyed Cara , the blackest of them, and more, that he is the only prime cause of all your troubles, though peradventure some person more happy, and at once more unhappy than he, by meer hazard, may have been thrown upon the prosecution of his Hellish designs against so excellent a person as Roxana is, where he himself had fallen short of them. At these words, Cara chang'd Colour, look'd on the Floor, and seem'd so discompos'd, that Roxana was seis'd with such strange Apprehensions at it, as made her to desire to be in private, under pretence of being suddenly taken ill. That was so conformable to the condition that Cara was in on his part, that he went out of the Cabin, without speaking one word more, nor so much as looking towards Roxana , who had turn'd likewise aside. Roxana being thus alone, began to reflect on what Cara had said: she wondred that a Person so wholly unknown to her, should have so much knowledge of her most secret Concerns, as he seem'd to have, she not doubting, but that he knew all, by what he had already said; she believ'd that he was not ignorant of her Rape, and fancied that peradventure he might know the Person that had done it. This made her to desire to know more, but she had not the confidence to require it: She wish'd that Cara would of his own accord fall accidentally on that Subject again, yet she dreaded to hear any more. In fine, she was in such a perplexity of thoughts, that they had almost driven from her all the apprehensions which she should have had of her approaching danger. Cara , on his part was not less surpriz'd; he had under his care that beautiful Person, which meer Fortune had thrown into his Arms, at the same time that the Mufti had contriv'd things so as to make her his own. He believ'd that the Mufti had mistrusted that he was the Person who had disappointed him, or taken his place; and he was perswaded, that his procuring of him such an Employ as he had, was but to distance him from Roxana , that he might not have the opportunity of making his peace with her, when she should know that he had enjoy'd her, when he had no thoughts of her, but was wholly bent on another. And finally, he believ'd, that in pure rage and revenge he had done her some very ill office towards the Emperour, which had made him consent to her death. These, and divers other thoughts did agitate him most violently: there wanted nothing more to confirm him in the belief of all those things but her acknowledging of the Ring he had taken from that Person whom he had enjoyed, but he had not the confidence to give or shew it to her: at last, he resolv'd to set down in writing what he would willingly have her to know, and to give it with the Ring wrapt up in it, to one of Roxana's Servants, to deliver it to Roxana : whereupon having taken Pen and Ink, he fram'd this following long Letter, that it might fully supply all that he had to say, which he could never utter before Roxana's presence.  It is with the greatest respect, and humblest submission imaginable, divine Roxana , that venture upon this enterprize, of informing you of a secret, on which, as you will resent the knowledge of it, depends either my eternal Misery or Happiness. And though I know my self to be wholly free from all ill designs or evil practices, in the whole business, yet I cannot but tremble when I think you may be ready to condemn me before you have read my Letter quite out. You may remember how long it is since you lost that Ring, which I send you here inclosed, though I believe you do not know how. No, Madam, those things which the wicked Mufti had perswaded his Sister Zora to give you, had too great a power over your Senses to permit you to make use of so much discernment; and could you have done that, you had been likewise capable of resisting those gentle efforts which I made on your Person. Yes, Madam, I here confess that I am the Person, who the Heavens thought more fit than the abominable Mufti , to gather those Fruits which he had design'd and contriv'd for his own Tooth, with contrivances that were hatch'd in Hell. But, Madam, I was innocent all this while; witness the strange surprizal I was in, to find that I had gather'd such Fruit as none had ever touch'd before, at that time, that all my thoughts were bent only on Zora , who that very night had made me an assignation in that Chamber where I met with you, Madam, and from whom I was far from expecting such Virgin Fruit, whose Life and Conversation I knew but too well. How she came not to be in that Chamber, and how I came to light on you there, does still remain a Riddle to me. I must confess, that at the resistance you would have made, and which you endeavour'd to make, as much as the narcotick effects of your Opium would permit, I found my mistake; but who could then abstain and retire? No Flesh and Blood, Madam: I accepted of what Fortune had thus thrown into my arms; and because I was absolutely ignorant of the Person I had met with, I took from her Finger the Ring which I have sent you. If any thing in all this adventure can be laid to my charge, which might render me guilty in the least circumstance imaginable towards you, I will doom my self immediately to death; nay, what is worse, I will deprive my self from the happiness of ever seeing you more, and yet live. But, Madam, if nothing but meer hazard and Fortune had the conduct of all that mystery, let me not for what is none of my fault, suffer the greatest of evils, your Frowns and Anger. The Heavens, in rescuing you from the embraces of so wicked a person as he, who had plotted the ruine of your Honour, did resign you into mine; and they thought me once before worthy of being your Deliverer. The same Heaven, Madam, did afterwards take you from the Mufti , to give you to me; and they have given me a Heart that is capable-of all things that are Noble and Just, and which may be valu'd on the very account of aspiring to the Honour of pleasing you. Though my Fortune is not great, my Extraction is Noble: deign therefore, beautiful Roxana , to look down a little upon a Person that the Fates design'd you from the beginning, that was produc'd for you, and that they have given you already: for who can look upon our unexpected, unsought, and unthought of encounter, and not conclude that it is the will of Heaven that we should be united? Is not this last act of your blackest Enemy, the greatest argument imaginable, that when he design'd most your Ruine, I should be chosen for the most happy Instrument of your deliverance, by the Heavens, as I had been once before of your deliverance from his filthy embraces? How can you then doubt, but that I was certainly design'd for you, as you have been for me. Resist not then against what the Heavens have decreed, but accept of an heart, which is so freely offer'd you.  Cara found that he could dwell for ever on this Theam, therefore he was forc'd to break off his Letter, which he gave to one of Roxana's Servants, who went immediately into the Cabin, and presented it to her. Roxana asked from whom it was, and she was told from Cara , which set her all in a trembling, with the apprehension of learning that which she so earnestly desired to know: She open'd it, and read it, and after that remain'd for a considerable time agitated with abundance of contrary thoughts on the whole Mystery of her deliverance, and afterwards of her ravishment, by the same person; and having seriously weighed all Circumstances, and convinc'd her self that Cara had not been in the least to blame, except he had before-hand known who she was, which he did not: She began to think, that of truth, the Heav'ns had design'd Cara for her, and she for him. Being further confirm'd therein, by that Providence which once appointed him to be her deliverer, and had delivered her into the hands of a person, that so passionately lov'd her, when she was design'd to have been given by that very person to her Executioners. She therefore resolv'd to comply to the Heav'ns Decrees, in receiving of Cara's Service in the preservation of her Life, which should pass as an Atonement for what he had done, and that she would place on the account of Merit, for the future. But when all was done, she had not the courage to speak to Cara , she therefore writ to him these following Lines.  I am convinc'd, that the Heavens have a great share, in the preservation of my Life, in so ordering of things, as to make me light into the hands of the same Person, that had accidentally preserv'd me from the most loathsome Embraces of a Monster, and that had a second time done the same, though at the dearest rate that I could purchase it. And I am but too well convinc'd, that I have met with my Ravisher by the Ring I have receiv'd, and that he is the same Person that was before my Preserver. But I am strangely disappointed as to the revenge, which I had always assur'd my self to take on the Thief. I find the flowing bitterness of my Gall, to turn into a more calm and pleasant Relish, and that I shall be forc'd to acknowledge Heaven's Decree and Dispensation in all the course of my misfortunes. I therefore must submit to its pleasure, and believe that I am oblig'd in gratitude, as well as on other terms, to acknowledge you my deliverer also. I know not how to tell you all this, and much more that I have to say. If you would save the Blushes of a person who is not us'd to make such Confessions, bring the Mufti's Letter along with you to me, and let me take my Eyes from you, to employ them on reading what death was appointed for me, while you shall busy your thoughts in contriving what course is best for my deliverance.  Cara having receiv'd this answer, was so over-joyed at it, that he presently run into Roxana's Cabbin, with the Letter open in his hand, after he had read it; and casting himself at Roxana's Feet, Here, Madam, said he , take this, take me, take all, and dispose of me, of my Vessel, and all my Men as you shall think fit; all is at your Command. Roxana was reading attentively the Letter all this while, after she had done, raising him up, You see Cara, said she , by this Letter, that the Heavens have decreed I should be yours; they would not else thus render me oblig'd to you for my Life; and since they have so order'd, that I must receive it as a Present from you, I think I ought in gratitude to return it again into your hands, and at your disposal. Madam , replyed Cara, my Life is bound up in yours, so that I cannot live without you; receive mine therefore, with all its habilities and functions, as absolutely depending on yours; and accept of a Person who shall ever be your Slave and your Admirer. I must do so , replyed Roxana; it is decreed, and I must submit to the will of Heaven , continu'd she, giving him the Ring, receive this Pledge again, which I now freely give you, in confirmation that I give my self to you also; and accept of this Weapon, which I present you, wherewith to defend me from all my Enemies , with that she gave him that Scimiter which he had left in her Chamber at Constantinople . He presently knew it again, receiv'd it, and said, I hope, Madam, that henceforth I shall have no occasion of using such Arms in your defence; I shall free you from your trouble by easier means. The wicked Mufti's Party is now so ruin'd, that the Ottoman Empire has spu'd him out, with divers more of his wicked Sect. Wicked indeed , replyed Roxana, so wicked, that I hate the very thoughts of that Sect, and would gladly embrace the True, Ancient , Mahometan Religion. You wanted nothing but that, Madam , replyed Cara, to accomplish you as my heart could wish; and certainly it is the same kind Heavens who have preserv'd your Life, that now takes care of your Soul also, in inspiring you with so good thoughts; oppose them not, but yield immediately to this Call from Heaven; retire from amongst a People that are pleas'd but with Deceits and Cruelties, and come amongst such as delight to serve their God in Spirit and Truth. I will immediately give order to steer back again to Turky, where you shall be instructed in the true Worship of our great Ala. Dispose of me as you please , reply'd Roxana; I am now yours by Gift, and so soon as I can get my Portion out of my Father's hands, I shall be yours also by Marriage. Cara having kiss'd Roxana's hand, they consulted together of the ways they should take to discover to Prince Soliman , the grand Cheat which the Clergy of Haly's Sect had put upon him, and the whole Ottoman Empire. In short, they had a better Wind in returning, than they had going, which quickly brought them back to the Shore, from whence they came to Constantinople , where the Prince was made sensible of the wrong which was intended to him by the Halists . The whole Empire thought themselves oblig'd to Soliman , in so high a measure, that in the great Assembly of the Divan , he was proclaim'd Emperour, and Zelinda Empress, that very day after she came to Constantinople. Roxana had her Portion allotted to her, which was sufficient to make Cara and her live happily together. She presently made open Profession of the True, Ancient, Mahometan Religion, and was married to Cara after that manner, and now live comfortably together, with all the Content and Satisfaction imaginable.
