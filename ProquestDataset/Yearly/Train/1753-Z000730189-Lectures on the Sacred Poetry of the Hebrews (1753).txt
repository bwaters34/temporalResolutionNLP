 them) which antiquity has transmitted to us: and which have hitherto seldom fallen under the inspection of rational criticism. Left, from the title of the work, or from the circumstance of being originally published in a learned language, a prejudice should arise in the breast of any individual, that these Lectures are addressed only to the learned, I think it a duty to anticipate a misapprehension which might interfere both with his entertainment and instruction. The greatest as well as the most useful works of taste and literature, are those, which, with respect at least to their general scope and design, lie most level to the common sense of mankind. Though the learning and genius displayed in the following Lectures must ever excite our warmest admiration; though they abound in curious researches, and in refined and exquisite observations; though the splendour of the sentiments and the elegance of the style will necessarily captivate the eye and the ear of the classical reader; the truth is, THAT THEY ARE MORE CALCULATED FOR PERSONS OF TASTE AND GENERAL READING, THAN FOR WHAT IS COMMONLY TERMED THE LEARNED WORLD. Here are few nice philological disquisitions, no abstruse metaphysical speculations; our author has built solely upon the basis of common sense, and I know no part of his work, which will not be intelligible and useful to almost every understanding. A still greater mistake it would be, to suppose any knowledge of the Hebrew necessary to enable us to read these Lectures with profit and pleasure. So happily does the simple genius of the Hebrew language accord with our own; and so excellent a transcript of the original (notwithstanding a few errors) is our common translation of the Scriptures; so completely, so minutely, I might say, does it represent the style and character of the Hebrew writings, that no person, who is conversant with it, can be at all at a loss in applying all the criticisms of our author. On this account I will venture to assert, that if the genius of the translator approached in any degree the clearness, the elegance, the elevation of the author, these Lectures in our own language would exhibit the subject in a much fairer and more advantageous light, than in the original form. The English idiom, indeed, has so much greater analogy to the Hebrew, that the advantages, which it possesses over the Latin, must be obvious to any reader who compares the literal translations in each of these languages. But the utility of these Lectures, as a system of criticism, is perhaps their smallest merit. They teach us not only taste but virtue; not only to admire and revere the Scriptures, but to profit by their precepts. The author of the present work is not to be considered merely as a master of the general principles of criticism; he has penetrated the very sanctuaries of Hebrew literature; he has investigated with a degree of precision, which few critics have attained, the very nature and character of their composition: by accurately examining, and cautiously comparing every part of the Sacred writings; by a force of genius, which could enter into the very design of the authors; and by a comprehensiveness of mind, which could embrace at a single view a vast series of corresponding passages, he has discovered the manner, the spirit, the idiom of the original, and has laid down such axioms as cannot fail greatly to facilitate our knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures. The work would amply repay the trouble of perusing it, by the excellent elucidations of particular passages of Holy writ which it affords; but, when we reflect that these are connected with such rules and principles as may be applied with the greatest advantage to other difficult passages, with such rules, indeed, as will enable us better to comprehend the whole, surely it must appear inestimable in the eye of any man, who has at all at heart his own improvement in religious knowledge. Perhaps the Sceptic may learn from the perusal of these Lectures, that the difficulties of which he complains in the Scriptures, are difficulties which might in some measure be removed by a little more knowledge, and a little more diligence in the application of it. Perhaps, too, those profound and learned critics, who quote and censure authors, whom they have never read, and talk fluently about languages, the rudiments of which they have yet to learn, may find, to their great astonishment, that a degree of penetration superior to their own is able to discover at least a few rays of sublimity in the writings of the Hebrews. Whatever be the merits or the defects of this Translation, on one account at least I will venture to promise myself the warmest commendations of my readers, namely, for having made them acquainted with the admirable criticisms of the learned Michaelis. I have much reason to regret, that the nature of this publication would not permit the insertion of all his observations, and at full length. But the truth is, however suitable they may have been to the work in its original form, some of his remarks are too refined to be generally useful; and some of them too learned to be intelligible to any, but those who are familiar with the whole circle of Oriental literature. I have therefore selected such of them as I thought applicable to my present purpose; and, as it was my wish to confine this work within as narrow limits as my duty to the public would permit, and to suffer in it nothing, but what I esteemed immediately useful, I have taken the liberty of abridging some, which I thought in a literal translation might appear tedious to the English reader. Some observations of my own I have also presumed to introduce among the notes. They were such as to me seemed calculated to render the work a more complete compendium of critical science. As I do not, however, think myself above censure, so I trust I shall not be found too obstinate for correction. Should my indiscretion, therefore, have obtruded any thing which a fair and liberal critic shall deem impertinent or improper, I shall with much cheerfulness, in a future edition, submit to its erasement. It was not till I had consulted some of the first literary characters concerning the propriety of substituting in the place of our author's inimitable Latin poems any English versions, that I ventured to appear as a poetical translator. Even then I did not fail to inspect every modern author, who I imagined might furnish me with compositions worthy of appearing among the criticisms of Lowth. I have preferred Mr. Merrick's Psalms to any version which I should have been able to produce, (except, indeed, in a single instance, where it was necessary that the measure should be elegiac) not only on account of their intrinsic merit, but in consequence of the commendation which our author has bestowed upon them. By the kindness of Mr. Mason also, this publication is enriched with one of the most beautiful Lyric productions in our language, I mean his paraphrase of the xivth of Isaiah. When I could find no translation to answer my purpose, I was obliged to attempt the versification of the passages myself. The public will therefore recollect, that I was a poet through necessity, not choice; and will, I flatter myself, receive this as a sufficient apology for the indifferent performance of that part of my undertaking. Presuming that it would be more agreeable to give the literal translations of the Hebrew from works of established reputation, I have taken many of them from our author's excellent version of Isaiah, from Mr. Blaney's Jeremiah, from Bishop Newcombe's Minor Prophets, Mr. Heath's Job, and from Dr. Hodgson's translation of the Canticles: and this I trust will be accepted by those Gentlemen as a general acknowledgment. Where these did not furnish me with a translation, I have endeavoured myself to produce one as faithful to the original as my knowledge of the language would admit. Convinced on the whole of the utility of this publication, and yet aware of my own inability to do it justice, I dismiss it with that mixed emotion of confidence and humility, which such a situation naturally inspires. Imperfect as it appears before the world, if it be the means of imparting to but a few some of that information, which all who read the original must regret was not more generally diffused, I am sure I shall have deserved well of the community: at the same time, the reader will do me great injustice, if he supposes that I have satisfied myself in the execution of my task. Whatever be its reception, it will disappoint no expectations formed by me of profit or of fame; and if neither ensue from it, I shall have no just cause of complaint. It was impossible to read these Lectures with the attention which even this translation required, and not derive advantages from them far superior to the labour they have cost me; and whatever may be their effect with others, I am confident they have left me something wiser, and I trust something better, than they found me. In the prosecution of this work I have incurred a debt of gratitude, which if I cannot discharge, it is but fair to acknowledge. By the advice and encouragement of Dr. Kippis, I was in a great measure induced to undertake this translation; by a continuance of the same friendly disposition I was enabled cheerfully to proceed in it. The public will easily perceive a part of their obligation and mine to the ingenious Mr. Henley of Rendlesham, in the numerous and valuable notes which bear his signature; but I am also indebted to him for many corrections. These are not the only friends, to whom I have been obliged on this occasion: I will venture to mention in particular Mr. Wakefield of Nottingham, a name sufficiently known in the classical world; and Mr. Foster of Woolton, near Liverpool, whose careful and laborious revision of my manuscript is the least of the many favours he has conferred upon me. To this companion of my youth, I can indeed with the strictest propriety apply the language of the Roman poet: "Tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles, Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes. Unum opus, & requiem pariter disponimus ambo: Atque verecunda laxamus seria mensa. Non equidem hoc dubites, amborum foedere certo Consentire dies & ab uno sidere duci. Nostra vel aequali suspendit tempora libra Parca tenax veri: seu nata fidelibus hora Dividit in geminos concordia fata duorum: Saturnumque gravem nostro Jove frangimus una. Nescio, quod certe est, quod me tibi temperat astrum." James-Street Terrace, Buckingham-Gate, March 1, 1787. 1 improvements, which have been made to this Edition. I have revised the whole work; I have added some things, I have corrected many; and especially in the notes. I have however refrained from all corrections which did not appear absolutely necessary. If any reader should object, that many passages remain, which might be amended, as being scarcely established upon the grounds of certainty and conviction; I have only to urge in my own defence, that on very obscure and difficult subjects, it has always appeared to me sufficient to propose a probable explication: nor can I esteem that to be correction, which only substitutes one conjecture for another. In other respects this Edition has received considerable improvements. In the first place I am greatly indebted to the friendly communications of the learned Dr. Kennicott, for the variations of the different copies in several passages of the Old Testament, which I have quoted. I have distinguished his notes by inverted commas, and by the letter K. subjoined. The Manuscripts are numbered according to the Catalogue annexed to that learned author's Dissertation on the Hebrew Text  2 . I have, moreover, added some observations of the learned Dr. Hunt, Professor of the Hebrew and Arabic languages, which he kindly communicated at my request. These also I have distinguished by inverted commas, and the letter H. subjoined. After this Edition was committed to the press, I was favoured with a sight of the Gottingen Edition, published under the inspection of the learned and ingenious Professor of Philosophy in that University, John David Michaelis, and greatly improved and illustrated by him. To this were added his notes and additions, in which he has with great candour supplied my defects, and corrected my errors. These, with the preface entire, and with a few additions to the notes, communicated to me by the author, (who would have added more, but that he was prevented by the increasing business of the University) I have printed in a separate volume, lest my readers should be deprived of these very learned and excellent illustrations: and I chose to do it in a separate state, that the purchasers of the first Edition might partake equally of the benefit. Whatever some of these notes may contain repugnant to my own sentiments, I have thought it better to submit them in this form to the judgment of the reader, than, by retracing my former ground, to divert his attention into a controversy, unpleasant, and probably fruitless. The purpose of poetry is to instruct while it gives pleasure; instruction being the end, and pleasure the means---Illustrated by examples from the different species of poetry--- The Didactic---The Epic---Tragedy---Lyric---the lighter kinds of poetry, which are calculated as well for the amusement of our leisure as for the ornament and improvement of literature .--- Sacred poetry; whence a transition to the immediate object of these Lectures . 3 could have wished; yet I cheerfully embrace the opportunity which it affords me of assuring you, Gentlemen, that to this undertaking (whether considered as a duty imposed, or as a favour conferred upon me) I bring, if no other accomplishment, at least industry and inclination. I could, indeed, more patiently bear to be accused of wanting genius, fluency, or elegance, than of wanting diligence in the exercise of that office, to which your authority has called me, or gratitude in the acceptance of that favour, which (whatever it be in itself) is undoubtedly great, since conferred on me by you. For to judge rightly of obligations of this kind, regard must be had not only to the favour itself, but to the persons who confer it, and to the person on whom it is conferred. When, therefore, I reflect, that the station, to which I am invited, has been adorned by men of the first rank in genius and learning; when I regard you, whose favour can add dignity to the most respectable characters; when, in fine, I consider myself, who could never have expected or hoped from my own merits for any public testimony of your approbation; I receive this appointment as an honour, for which the utmost exertions of labour and assiduity will be but a very inadequate return. This part of my duty, however, though feebly and imperfectly, I would wish you to believe I most willingly perform: for to an ingenuous mind nothing can be more agreeable than the expression, or even the sense of gratitude; and the remembrance of the obligation will rather stimulate than depress. Other considerations have, I must confess, rendered me not a little solicitous: I am appointed to superintend a particular department of science, which you have constantly distinguished by your presence and attention; and a subject is to be discussed, which not only you have judged worthy of your cultivation, and the public countenance of the University, but which has hitherto received in this place all the embellishments of grace and elegance, of which it is naturally susceptible. Should it therefore fall into neglect or disrepute hereafter, I fear, that I shall be compelled to acknowledge the fault to have been mine, and not that of the institution itself. Whatever degree of success indeed may attend my endeavours, let it not for a moment be suspected, that the design is not altogether deserving of approbation. For can there be any thing of more real importance to literature itself, can any thing be more consistent with the ends for which this University was founded, than that the art, of whose assistance every other art and profession has so greatly availed itself, should be assigned a place among the rest? That art, so venerable for its antiquity, so delightful in itself; that art, which is in a manner congenial to humanity, and which sets off Nature by the most agreeable representation of her beauties: which among the ignorant and the learned, the idle and the studious, has ever obtained favour, admiration and regard. Nothing surely can be more worthy of a liberal and accomplished mind, than to perceive what is perfect, and what is defective in an art, the beauties of which frequently lie beneath the surface; to understand what is graceful, what is becoming, in what its excellencies consist, and in a word to discover and relish those delicate touches of grace and elegance, that lie beyond the reach of vulgar apprehension. From these subtile researches after beauty and taste, there is also the fairest reason to apprehend that the judgment itself will receive some accessions of strength and acuteness, which it may successfully employ upon other objects, and upon other occasions. Such at least appear to have been the sentiments of that excellent person  4 , to whose munificence Poetry has been long indebted for her admission into the circle of those sciences which are cultivated in this University. For possessing a mind not only instructed in the most useful branches of knowledge, but adorned with the most elegant arts; and having imbibed the first principles of education in a seminary, where the most important and sacred subjects, recommended by all the elegance of polite literature, have been heretofore, and still continue to be, studied with vigour and effect; he saw and experienced, how much an attention to these elegancies would contribute to the investigation or illustration of the severer branches of erudition, and how strict the alliance between Philosophy and the Muses. The design, therefore, of the author of this Institution, as well as the usual practice on occasions like the present, reminds me, Gentlemen, of the propriety (though a matter already familiar to most of you) of premising a few such observations, as appear least exceptionable concerning the end and utility of the poetic art. Poetry is commonly understood to have two objects in view, namely, advantage and pleasure, or rather an union of both. I wish those who have furnished us with this definition, had rather proposed utility as its ultimate object  5 , and pleasure as the means by which that end may be effectually accomplished. The Philosopher and the Poet indeed seem principally to differ in the means, by which they pursue the same end. Each sustains the character of a preceptor, which the one is thought best to support, if he teach with accuracy, with subtlety, and with perspicuity; the other, with splendour, harmony and elegance. The one makes his appeal to reason only, independent of the passions; the other addresses the reason in such a manner, as even to engage the passions on his side. The one proceeds to Virtue and Truth by the nearest and most compendious ways; the other leads to the same point through certain deflexions and deviations, by a winding, but pleasanter path. It is the part of the former so to describe and explain these objects, that we must necessarily become acquainted with them; it is the part of the latter so to dress and adorn them, that of our own accord we must love and embrace them. I therefore lay it down as a fundamental maxim, that Poetry is useful, chiefly because it is agreeable; and should I, as we are apt to do, attribute too much to my favourite occupation, I trust Philosophy will forgive me, when I add, that the writings of the Poet are more useful than those of the Philosopher, inasmuch as they are more agreeable. To illustrate this position by wellknown examples: Can it be supposed that the more learned Romans, when they became devoted to the doctrine of Epicurus, did not more highly esteem, and more frequently apply to the admirable poem of Lucretius, than to Catius, or Amafanius, or even the commentaries of Epicurus himself? Who can believe that even the most tasteless could peruse the writings on agriculture, either of the learned Varro, or (not to mention the elder Cato) of Columella, an author by no means deficient in elegance, with the same pleasure and attention as that most delightful and most perfect work, the Georgics of Virgil? A work in which he has equalled the most respectable writers in the solidity of his matter  6 , and has greatly excelled the most elegant in the incredible harmony of his numbers. On the contrary, if Manilius, who is numbered (and rightly if we may credit his own testimony) among the writers of the Augustan age, has treated the engaging science of Astronomy in such low and inelegant verse, as even scarcely to excel Julius Firmicus, a prose writer on the same subject in a less polished age, I will allow him the merit of a Philosopher and Astronomer, but never can account him a Poet. For what is a Poet, destitute of harmony, of grace, and of all that conduces to allurement and delight? or how should we derive advantage or improvement from an author, whom no man of taste can endure to read? The reason, therefore, why Poetry is so studious to embellish her precepts with a certain inviting sweetness, and as it were \---"tincture them with the honey of the Muses," is plainly, by such seasoning to conciliate favour to her doctrine, as is the practice even of physicians, who temper with pleasant flavours their least agreeable medicines: "Thus the sick infant's taste disguis'd to meet; "They tinge the vessel's brim with juices sweet; "The bitter draught his willing lip receives; "He drinks deceiv'd, and so deceiv'd he lives;" as Lucretius expresses himself in illustration of his own design, as well as that of Poetry in general. But if it be manifest, even in authors who directly profess improvement and advantage, that those will most efficaciously instruct, who afford most entertainment; the same will be still more apparent in those, who dissembling the intention of instruction, exhibit only the blandishments of pleasure; and while they treat of the most important things, of all the principles of moral action, all the offices of life, yet laying aside the severity of the preceptor, adduce at once all the decorations of elegance, and all the attractions of amusement: who display, as in a picture, the actions, the manners, the pursuits and passions of men; and by the force of imitation and fancy, by the harmony of numbers, by the taste and variety of imagery, captivate the affections of the reader, and imperceptibly, or perhaps reluctantly, impel him to the pursuit of virtue. Such is the real purpose of heroic poetry; such is the noble effect produced by the perusal of Homer. And who so thoughtless, or so callous, as not to feel incredible pleasure in that most agreeable occupation; who is not moved, astonished, enraptured by the inspiration of that most sublime genius? Who so inanimate as not to see, not to feel inscribed, or as it were imprinted upon his heart, his most excellent maxims concerning human life and manners? From Philosophy a few cold precepts may be deduced; in History some dull and spiritless examples of manners may be found: here we have the energetic voice of Virtue herself, here we behold her animated form. Poetry addresses her precepts not to the reason alone, she calls the passions to her aid: she not only exhibits examples, but infixes them in the mind. She softens the wax with her peculiar ardour, and renders it more plastic to the artist's hand. Thus does Horace most truly and most justly apply this commendation to the poets: "What's fair, and false, and right, these bards describe, "Better and plainer than the Stoic tribe:" Plainer or more completely, because they do not perplex their disciples with the dry detail of parts and definitions, but so perfectly and so accurately delineate by examples of everykind, the forms of the human passions and habits, the principles of social and civilized life, that he, who from the schools of Philosophy should turn to the representations of Homer, would feel himself transported from a narrow and intricate path to an extensive and flourishing field. Better, because the Poet teaches not by maxims and precepts, and in the dull, sententious form; but by the harmony of verse, by the beauty of imagery, by the ingenuity of the fable, by the exactness of imitation, he allures and interests the mind of the reader, he fashions it to habits of virtue, and in a manner informs it with the spirit of integrity itself. But if, from the Heroic we turn to the Tragic Muse, to which Aristotle  7 indeed assigns the preference, because of the true and perfect imitation, we shall yet more clearly evince the superiority of Poetry over Philosophy, on the principle of its being more agreeable. Tragedy is, in truth, no other than Philosophy introduced upon the stage, retaining all its natural properties, remitting nothing of its native gravity, but assisted and embellished by other favouring circumstances. What point, for instance, of moral discipline have the Tragic writers of Greece left untouched, or unadorned? What duty of life, what principle of political economy, what motive or precept for the government of the passions, what commendation of virtue is there, which they have not treated of with fulness, variety and learning? The moral of Æschylus (not only a poet, but a Pythagorean) will ever be admired. Nor were Sophocles and Euripides less illustrious for the reputation of wisdom; the latter of whom was the disciple of Socrates and Anaxagoras, and was known among his friends by the title of the Dramatic Philosopher. In these authors surely, the allurements of Poetry afforded some accession to the empire of Philosophy; nor indeed has any man arrived at the summit of Poetic fame, who did not previously lay the foundation of his art in true Philosophy. Should it be objected, that some have been eminent in this walk of Poetry, who never studied in the schools of the Philosophers, nor enjoyed the advantages of an education above the common herd of mankind; I answer, that I am not contending about the vulgar opinion, or concerning the meaning of a word: the man who, by the force of genius and observation, has arrived at a perfect knowledge of mankind, who has acquainted himself with the natural powers of the human mind, and the causes by which the passions are excited and repressed; who not only in words can explain, but can delineate to the senses every emotion of the soul; who can excite, can temper and regulate the passions; such a man, though he may not have acquired erudition by the common methods, I esteem a true Philosopher. The passion of jealousy, its causes, circumstances, its progress, and effects, I hold to be more accurately, more copiously, more satisfactorily described in one of the dramas of Shakespeare, than in all the disputations of the schools of Philosophy. Now if Tragedy be of so truly a philosophical nature; and if to all the force and gravity of wisdom it add graces and allurements peculiarly its own, the harmony of verse, the contrivance of the fable, the excellence of imitation, the truth of action; shall we not say that Philosophy must yield to Poetry in point of utility; or shall we not rather say, that the former is greatly indebted to the latter, of whose assistance and recommendation it makes so advantageous a use, in order to attain its particular purpose, utility or improvement? "But if the force of imitation and fable be so great, the force of truth itself must surely appear much greater: we should therefore apply to History rather than to Poetry for instruction in morals." This however is a mistaken notion. History is confined within too narrow limits; History is subject to laws peculiar to itself, and too severe to admit of such an application. It relates things as they really were, it traces events under the guidance of authority; it must exhibit what has happened, not what might or ought to have happened. It must not deviate in quest of reasonable instruction or plausible conjecture, but confine itself to that path, which the stubbornness of fact has prescribed. History treats of things and persons which have been in actual existence; the subjects of Poetry are infinite and universal. The one investigates causes through the uncertain medium of conjecture; the other demonstrates them with clearness and certainty. The one catches the casual glimpses of truth, whenever they break forth to the view; the other contemplates her unclouded appearance. History pursues her appointed journey by a direct path; Poetry ranges uncontrolled over the wide expanse of nature. The former must make her precepts subservient to the subject; the latter forms a subject subordinate to her precepts and design. For these reasons Poetry is defined by Aristotle to be something of a more serious and philosophical nature than History  8 ; nor is our Bacon (a name not inferior in literature) of a different sentiment. The subject itself, and the authority of so great a man, require that the passage should be quoted in his own words. "Since the sensible world is in dignity inferior to the rational soul; Poetry seems to endow human nature with that which lies beyond the power of History, and to gratify the mind with at least the shadow of things, where the substance cannot be had. For if the matter be properly considered, an argument may be drawn from Poetry, that a superior dignity in things, a more perfect order, and a more beautiful variety delights the soul of man, than is found in nature since the fall. As, therefore, the actions and events, which are the subject of true History, are not of sufficient amplitude to content the mind of man; Poetry is at hand, and invents actions of a more heroic nature. Because true History reports the success of events not proportionably to desert, or according to the virtue or vice that has been displayed in them; Poetry corrects this, and represents events and fortunes according to justice and merit: Because true History from the obvious similarity of actions, and the satiety which this circumstance must occasion, frequently creates a distaste in the mind; Poetry cheers and refreshes it, exhibiting things uncommon, varied, and full of vicissitude. As Poetry, therefore, contributes not only to pleasure, but to magnanimity and good morals; it is deservedly supposed to participate in some measure of divine inspiration; since it raises the mind, and fills it with sublime ideas, by proportioning the appearances of things to the desires of the mind; and not submitting the mind to things, like Reason and History  9 ." That elevation of sentiment, that inspiration, that usefulness in forming the manners, is however by no means so peculiar to the Epic (to which that great man chiefly refers in this passage) as to exclude the claim of every other species of Poetry; there are others which also deserve to partake in the commendation: and first the Ode, "With thoughts that breathe, and words that burn;" which, though in some respects inferior to what are called the higher species of Poetry, yields to none in force, ardour, and sometimes even in dignity and solemnity. Every species of Poetry has in fact its peculiar mode of acting on the human feelings; the general effect is perhaps the same. The Epic accomplishes its design with more leisure, with more consideration and care, and therefore probably with greater certainty. It more gradually insinuates itself, it penetrates, it moves, it delights; now rising to a high degree of sublimity, now subsiding to its accustomed smoothness; and conducting the reader through a varied and delightful scene, it applies a gentle constraint to the mind, making its impression by the forcible nature of this application, but more especially by its continuance. The Ode, on the contrary, strikes with an instantaneous effect, amazes, and as it were storms the affections. The one may be compared to a flame, which fanned by the winds, gradually spreads itself on all sides, and at last involves every object in the conflagration; the other to a flash of lightning, which instantaneously bursts forth, "With instant ruin threats great Nature's frame, "And shoots through ev'ry part the vivid flame." The amazing power of Lyric Poetry in directing the passions, in forming the manners, in maintaining civil life, and particularly in exciting and cherishing that generous elevation of sentiment, on which the very existence of public virtue seems to depend, will be sufficiently apparent by only contemplating those monuments of Genius, which Greece has bequeathed to posterity. If we examine the poems of Pindar (which though by no means accounted the most excellent of their kind, by some strange fatality are almost the only specimens that remain) how exquisite must have been the pleasure, how vivid the sensation to the Greek, whose ordinary amusement it was to sing, or hear them sung! For this kind of entertainment was not confined to persons of taste and learning, but had grown into general use. When he heard his Gods, his heroes, his ancestors received into the number of the Gods, celebrated in a manner so glorious, so divine, would not his bosom glow with the desire of fame, with the most fervid emulation of virtue, with a patriotism, immoderate perhaps, but honourable and useful in the highest degree? Is it wonderful, that he should be so elevated with this greatness of mind (shall I call it?) or rather insolence and pride, as to esteem every other people mean, barbarous and contemptible, in comparison with himself and his own countrymen? It is almost unnecessary to remind this assembly, that, in the sacred Games (which afforded so much support to the warlike virtue of Greece  10 ) no inconsiderable share of dignity and esteem resulted from the verses of the poets; nor did the Olympic crown exhibit a more ample reward to the candidate for victory, than the encomium of Pindar or Stesichorus. I wish, indeed, that time had not invidiously deprived us of the works of the latter, whose majesty and excellence commanded universal applause, whom Dionysius  11 preferred before every other Lyric poet, because he made choice of the sublimest and most splendid subjects, and in the amplification of them preserved most completely the manners and the dignity of his characters. To Alcaeus, however, the same author attributes the most excellent manner of treating political subjects  12 . As a man, indeed, how great! as a citizen how strenuous! What a spirited defender of the laws and constitution of his country! What a vigorous opposer of tyrants! who consecrated equally his sword and his lyre on the altar of Freedom! whose prophetic Muse ranging through every region, acted as the sacred guardian, not for the present moment only, but for future ages; not of his own city alone, but of the whole commonwealth of Greece. Poetry such as this, so vehement, so animated, is certainly to be esteemed highly efficacious as well in exciting the human mind to virtue, as in purifying it from every mean and vicious propensity; but still more especially does it conduce to cherish and support that vigour of soul, that generous temper and spirit, which is both the offspring and guardian of Liberty. Could an apprehension arise, that another Pisistratus would meditate the enslaving of that city, where at every banquet, nay, in the streets and in the meanest assemblies of the common people, that convivial ode was daily sung, which bears the name of Callistratus? An author known to us only by this composition, which however sufficiently demonstrates him to have been an admirable poet and an excellent citizen  13 : Verdant myrtle's branchy pride, Shall my thirsty blade entwine: Such Harmodius deck'd thy side, Such Aristogiton thine. Noblest youths! in islands blest, Not like recreant idlers dead; You with fleet Pelides rest, And with Godlike Diomed . Myrtle shall our brows entwine, While the Muse your Fame shall tell; 'Twas at Pallas' sacred shrine, At your feet the Tyrant fell. Then in Athens all was peace, Equal laws and liberty: Nurse of arts and eye of Greece, People valiant, firm and free  14 ! If after the memorable Ides of March , any one of the Tyrannicides had delivered to the populace such a poem as this, had introduced it to the Suburra, to the assemblies of the Forum, or had put it into the mouths of the common people, the dominion of the C aesars and its adherents would have been totally extinguished: and I am firmly persuaded, that one stanza of this simple ballad of Harmodius would have been more effectual than all the Philippics of Cicero. There are some other species of Poetry, which with us generally appear in an easy and familiar style, but formerly assumed sometimes a graver and more important character. Such is the Elegy; I do not speak of the light and amorous Elegy of the moderns, but that ancient, serious, sacred, and didactic Elegy, the preceptress of morals, the lawgiver of nations, the oracle of virtue. Not to enter into a detail of authors, of whose works we are not in possession, and of whose merits we consequently can form no adequate judgment, it will be sufficient to instance Solon, the most venerable character of antiquity, the wisest of legislators, and withal a poet of no mean reputation. When any thing difficult or perplexing occurred in the administration of public affairs, we are informed that he had recourse to Poetry  15 . Were the laws to be maintained or enforced upon any particular emergency; was the indolence or licentiousness of the citizens to be reproved; were their minds to be stimulated to the love of liberty, he immediately attacked them with some poetical production, bold, animated, and severe, in the highest tone of censorial gravity, and yet in no respect deficient in elegance: "Before the awful peal the lightning flies, "And gathering clouds impending storms presage; "By souls aspiring civil freedom dies; "The people's madness whets the tyrant's rage." It is a well-known fact, that Athens was altogether indebted for the recovery of Salamis to the verses of Solon; even contrary to their own inclination and intention. After they had, from repeated overthrows, fallen into the deepest despair, insomuch that it was made a capital offence, even to propose the renewal of the war, or the reclaiming of the island, such was the influence of that single poem, which begins---"Let us march to Salamis," that as if pronounced by a prophet, instinct with divine enthusiasm, the people, propelled by a kind of celestial inspiration, flew immediately to arms, became clamorous for war, and sought the field of battle with such incredible ardour, that by the violence of their onset, after a great slaughter of the enemy, they atchieved a most decisive victory. We have also some remains of the celebrated Tyrtaeus, who \---"manly souls to martial deeds "By verse excited." The whole scope and subject of his compositions, is the celebration of valour and patriotism, and the immortal glory of those, who bravely fell in battle:---compositions, which could impart some degree of courage even to the timid and unmanly; by which, indeed, he elevated the minds of the Lacedemonians, which had been long debilitated and depressed, to the certain hope of victory. The fact is well known, and had it not been corroborated by the testimony of so many authors, it would doubtless have been thought by some incredible; though I confess it appears to me no less supported by the reason of things than by the authority of the historian. It is impossible that men should act otherwise than with the most heroic ardour, the most undaunted resolution, who sung to the martial pipe, when arranged in military order, marching to the onset, or perhaps actually engaged, such strains as these: Our country's voice invites the brave The glorious toils of war to try; Curs'd be the coward or the slave, Who shuns the fight, who fears to die! Obedient to the high command, Full fraught with patriotic fire, Descends a small but trusty band, And scarce restrains th'impatient ire. Lo the hostile crouds advance! Firmly we their might oppose, Helm to helm, and lance to lance, In awful pomp we meet our foes. Unaw'd by fear, untaught to yield, We boldly tread th' ensanguin'd plain: And scorn to quit the martial field, Though drench'd in blood, though heap'd with slain. For though stern Death assail the brave, His virtues endless life shall claim; His fame shall mock th' invidious grave, To times unborn a sacred name! Not entirely to omit the lighter kinds of Poetry, many will think that we allow them full enough, when we suppose their utility to consist in the entertainment which they afford. Nor is this, Gentlemen, altogether to be despised, if it be considered that this entertainment, this levity itself, affords relaxation to the mind when wearied with the laborious investigation of truth; that it unbends the understanding, after intense application; restores it when debilitated; and refreshes it, even by an interchange and variety of study. In this we are countenanced by the example and authority of the greatest men of Greece, by that of Solon, Plato and Aristotle; among the Romans, by that of Scipio and Laelius, Julius and Augustus Caesar, Varro and Brutus, who filled up the intervals of their more important engagements, their severer studies, with the agreeableness and hilarity of this poetical talent. Nature indeed seems in this most wisely to have consulted for us, who, while she impels us to the knowledge of truth, which is frequently remote, and only to be prosecuted with indefatigable industry, has provided also these pleasing recreations, as a refuge to the mind, in which it might occasionally shelter itself, and find an agreeable relief from languor and anxiety. But there is yet a further advantage to be derived from these studies, which ought not to be neglected; for beside possessing in reserve a certain solace of your labours, from the same repository you will also be supplied with many of the brightest ornaments of literature. The first object is, indeed, to perceive and comprehend clearly the reasons, principles, and relations of things; the next is to be able to explain your conceptions not only with perspicuity, but with a degree of elegance. For in this respect we are all of us in some measure fastidious: we are seldom contented with a jejune and naked exposition even of the most serious subjects, some of the seasonings of art, some ornaments of style, some splendor of diction, are of necessity to be adopted; even some regard is due to the harmony of numbers, and to the gratification of the ear. In all these respects, though I grant that the language of Poetry differs very widely from that of all other kinds of composition, yet he, who has bestowed some time and attention on the perusal and imitation of the Poets, will, I am persuaded, find his understanding exercised and improved as it were in this Palestra, the vigour and activity of his imagination increased, and even his manner of expression to have insensibly acquired a tinge from this elegant intercourse. Thus we observe in persons, who have been taught to dance, a certain indescribable grace and manner; though they do not form their common gesture and gait by any certain rules, yet there results from that exercise a degree of elegance, which accompanies those who have been proficients in it, even when they have relinquished the practice. Nor is it in the least improbable, that both Caesar and Tully  16 (the one the most elegant, the other the most eloquent of the Romans) might have derived considerable assistance from the cultivation of this branch of polite literature, since it is well known, that both of them were addicted to the reading of Poetry, and even exercised in the composition of it  17 . This too is so apparent in the writings of Plato, that he is thought not only to have erred in his judgment, but to have acted an ungrateful part, when he excluded from his imaginary commonwealth that art, to which he was so much indebted for the splendour and elegance of his genius, from whose fountains he had derived that soft, copious, and harmonious style, for which he is so justly admired. But to return to the nobler and more important productions of the Muses. Thus far Poetry must be allowed to stand eminent among the other liberal arts; inasmuch as it refreshes the mind when it is fatigued, sooths it when it is agitated, relieves and invigorates it when it is depressed; as it elevates the thoughts to the admiration of what is beautiful, what is becoming, what is great and noble: nor is it enough to say, that it delivers the precepts of virtue in the most agreeable manner; it insinuates or instils into the soul the very principles of morality itself. Moreover, since the desire of glory, innate in man, appears to be the most powerful incentive to great and heroic actions, it is the peculiar function of Poetry to improve this bias of our nature, and thus to cherish and enliven the embers of virtue: and since one of the principal employments of Poetry consists in the celebration of great and virtuous actions, in transmitting to posterity the examples of the bravest and most excellent men, and in consecrating their names to immortality; this praise is certainly its due, that while it forms the mind to habits of rectitude by its precepts, directs it by examples, excites and animates it by its peculiar force, it has also the distinguished honour of distributing to virtue the most ample and desirable rewards of its labours. But after all, we shall think more humbly of Poetry than it deserves, unless we direct our attention to that quarter, where its importance is most eminently conspicuous; unless we contemplate it as employed on sacred subjects, and in subservience to Religion. This indeed appears to have been the original office and destination of Poetry; and this it still so happily performs, that in all other cases it seems out of character, as if intended for this purpose alone. In other instances Poetry appears to want the assistance of art, but in this to shine forth with all its natural splendour, or rather to be animated by that inspiration, which on other occasions is spoken of without being felt. These observations are remarkably exemplified in the Hebrew Poetry, than which the human mind can conceive nothing more elevated, more beautiful, or more elegant; in which the almost ineffable sublimity of the subject is fully equalled by the energy of the language, and the dignity of the style. And it is worthy observation, that as some of these writings exceed in antiquity the fabulous ages of Greece, in sublimity they are superior to the most finished productions of that polished people. Thus if the actual origin of Poetry be inquired after, it must of necessity be referred to Religion; and since it appears to be an art derived from nature alone, peculiar to no age or nation, and only at an advanced period of society conformed to rule and method, it must be wholly attributed to the more violent affections of the heart, the nature of which is to express themselves in an animated and lofty tone, with a vehemence of expression far remote from vulgar use. It is also no less observable, that these affections break and interrupt the enunciation by their impetuosity; they burst forth in sentences pointed, earnest, rapid, and tremulous; and in some degree the style as well as the modulation is adapted to the emotions and habits of the mind. This is particularly the case in admiration and delight; and what passions are so likely to be excited by religious contemplations as these? What ideas could so powerfully affect a new-created mind (undepraved by habit or opinion) as the goodness, the wisdom, and the greatness of the Almighty? Is it not probable, that the first effort of rude and unpolished verse would display itself in the praise of the Creator, and flow almost involuntarily from the enraptured mind? Thus far at least is certain, that Poetry has been nurtured in those sacred places, where she seems to have been first called into existence; and that her original occupation was in the temple and at the altar. However ages and nations may have differed in their religious sentiments and opinions, in this at least we find them all agreed, that the mysteries of their devotion were celebrated in verse  18 . Of this origin Poetry even yet exhibits no obscure indications, since she ever embraces a divine and sacred subject with a kind of filial tenderness and affection. To the sacred haunts of Religion she delights to resort as to her native soil; there she most willingly inhabits, and there she flourishes in all her pristine beauty and vigour. But to have slightly glanced at the subject, appears sufficient for the present; we shall soon perhaps find an opportunity of entering upon a more ample discussion. I trust, indeed, that you will pardon me, Gentlemen, if I do not as yet venture to explain my future plan of instruction, and the form and method which I think of pursuing. That man must have too little respect for your judgment, and by far too high an opinion of his own, who would presume to produce before you matter not sufficiently digested, not sufficiently polished and perfected by study and by the maturest consideration. I have therefore determined within myself, that nothing shall hastily or prematurely proceed from me in this assembly, nothing which is not laboured to the extent of my abilities; and that for what is wanting in genius, in erudition, in fluency, and in every respect in which I feel myself deficient, I shall endeavour to compensate, as much as possible, by care and assiduity. If in these points I shall be enabled to perform my duty, I trust, Gentlemen, that other deficiencies you will be kind enough to excuse; and that the person whom you have honoured with your favour and attention; with your candour and indulgence, you will continue to support. The dignity of the subject, and its suitableness to the design of the institution---That Poetry which proceeds from divine inspiration is not beyond the province of criticism---Criticism will enable us to account for the origin of the art, as well as to form a just estimation of its dignity; that the opinion of the divine origin of Poetry was common in Greece--- This work purely critical: and consequently theological disquisitions will be avoided--- The general distribution of the subject into three parts, the nature of the verse, the style, and the arrangement . SOCRATES, as we read in Plato  19 , having been frequently admonished in a dream to apply to music; and esteeming himself bound to fulfil a duty, which appeared to have been imposed upon him by divine authority, began with composing a hymn to Apollo, and afterwards undertook to translate some of the fables of  Æsop into verse. This he did, I apprehend, under the persuasion, that the first-fruits of his poetry (which he esteemed the principal branch of the science of music  20 ) ought to be consecrated to the immortal Gods; and that it was not lawful for him, who was but little versed in those studies, to descend to lighter subjects, which perhaps might in the main be more agreeable to his genius, before he had discharged the obligations of religion. It is my intention, Gentlemen, to follow the example of this great philosopher; and since the University has honoured me with this office of explaining to you the nature and principles of Poetry, I mean to enter upon it from that quarter, whence he thought himself obliged to commence the study and practice of the art. I have determined, therefore, in the first place, to treat of Sacred Poetry, that species, I mean, which was cultivated by the ancient Hebrews, and which is peculiarly appropriated to subjects the most solemn and sublime; that should my endeavours prove unequal to so great a subject, I may, as it were, with favourable auspices, descend to matters of inferior importance. I undertake this office, however, with the most perfect conviction, that not only from a regard to duty it ought to be executed with diligence; but from the respectability of that body, at whose command it is undertaken, it ought to be executed with honour and reputation; nor is it merely to be considered what the intent of the institution and the improvement of the students may require, but what will be consistent with the dignity of this University. For since the University, when it gave its sanction to this species of discipline by a special decree, recommended the study of Poetry, particularly because it might conduce to the improvement of the more important sciences, as well sacred as profane  21 , nothing could certainly appear more useful in itself, or more agreeable to the purpose of this institution, and the design of its learned patrons, than to treat of that species of Poetry, which constitutes so considerable a part of sacred literature, and excels all other Poetry, not less in the sublimity of the style than in the dignity of the subject. It would not be easy, indeed, to assign a reason, why the writings of Homer, of Pindar, and of Horace, should engross our attention and monopolize our praise, while those of Moses, of David and Isaiah pass totally unregarded. Shall we suppose that the subject is not adapted to a seminary, in which sacred literature has ever maintained a precedence? Shall we say, that it is foreign to this assembly of promising youth, of whom the greater part have consecrated the best portion of their time and labour to the same department of learning? Or must we conclude, that the writings of those men, who have accomplished only as much as human genius and ability could accomplish, should be reduced to method and theory; but that those which boast a much higher origin, and are justly attributed to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, may be considered as indeed illustrious by their native force and beauty, but not as conformable to the principles of science, nor to be circumscribed by any rules of art? It is indeed most true, that sacred Poetry, if we contemplate its origin alone, is far superior to both nature and art ; but if we would rightly estimate its excellencies, that is, if we wish to understand its power in exciting the human affections, we must have recourse to both: for we must consider what those affections are, and by what means they are to be excited. Moreover, as in all other branches of science, so in Poetry, art or theory consists in a certain knowledge derived from the careful observation of nature, and confirmed by practice and experience; for men of learning having remarked in things what was graceful, what was fit, what was conducive to the attainment of certain ends, they digested such discoveries as had been casually made, and reduced them to an established order or method: whence it is evident, that art deduces its origin from the works of genius, not that genius has been formed or directed by art; and that it is properly applied in illustrating the works of even those writers, who were either ignorant of its rules, or inattentive to them. Since then it is the purpose of sacred Poetry to form the human mind to the constant habit of true virtue and piety, and to excite the more ardent affections of the soul, in order to direct them to their proper end; whoever has a clear insight into the instruments, the machinery as it were, by which this end is effected, will certainly contribute not a little to the improvement of the critical art. Now although it be scarcely possible to penetrate to the fountains of this celestial Nile, yet it may surely be allowed us to pursue the meanders of the stream, to mark the flux and reflux of its waters, and even to conduct a few rivulets into the adjacent plains. The sacred Poetry is undoubtedly entitled to the first rank in this school, since from it we are to learn both the origin of the art, and how to estimate its excellence. The commencement of other arts, however rude and imperfect, and though employed only on light and trivial matters, is an inquiry generally productive of satisfaction and delight. Here we may contemplate Poetry in its very beginning; not so much the offspring of human genius, as an emanation from heaven; not gradually increasing by small accessions, but from its birth possessing a certain maturity both of beauty and strength;  22 not administering to trifling passions, and offering its delicious incense at the shrine of vanity, but the Priestess of divine truth, the Internunciate between earth and heaven. For this was the first and peculiar office of Poetry, on the one hand to commend to the Almighty the prayers and thanksgivings of his creatures, and to celebrate his praises;---and on the other, to display to mankind the mysteries of the divine will, and the predictions of future events: the best and noblest of all employments. It is to this observation, indeed, that I would particularly point your attention; for it is plain from the general tenour of the sacred volume, that the indications of future events have been, almost without exception, revealed in numbers and in verse; and that the same spirit was accustomed to impart, by its own energy, at once the presentiment of things, and to cloath it in all the magnificence, in all the elegance of Poetry, that the sublimity of the style might consist with sentiments so infinitely surpassing all human conception. When considered, therefore, in this point of view, what is there of all which the most devoted admirers of Poetry have ever written or fabricated in its commendation, that does not fall greatly short of the truth itself? What of all the insinuations, which its bitterest adversaries have objected against it, which is not refuted by simply contemplating the nature and design of the Hebrew Poetry? Let those who affect to despise the Muses cease to attempt, for the vices of a few, who may abuse the best of things, to bring into disrepute a most laudable talent. Let them cease to speak of that art as light or trifling in itself, to accuse it as profane or impious; that art, which has been conceded to man by the favour of his Creator, and for the most sacred purposes; that art, consecrated by the authority of God himself, and by his example in his most august ministrations. Whether the Greeks originally derived their poetry from the fountains of nature, or received it through a different channel from a remoter source, appears a question of little importance, and not easy to be determined. Thus far, however, is evident, that an opinion was prevalent in Greece concerning the nature and origin of poetry, which appears most groundless and absurd, if we contemplate only the poetry of Greece, though truly and justly applicable to that of the Hebrews. They considered Poetry as something sacred and celestial, not produced by human art or genius, but altogether a divine gift. Among them, therefore, poets were accounted sacred, the ambassadors of heaven, men favoured with an immediate intercourse and familiarity with the Gods. The mysteries and ceremonies of their religion, and the worship of their deities, were all performed in verse; and the most ancient of their compositions, their oracles, always consisted of numbers. This circumstance I must add rendered them not only more sublime, but more deserving of credit in the eyes of the common people; for they conceived it equally the effect of divine inspiration to foresee events, and to express them in extemporaneous verse. Thus they seem to have retained some traces of an opinion impressed upon the minds of men in the very earliest ages concerning the true and ancient poetry, even after they had lost the reality itself, and when religion and poetry had by the licentiousness of fiction reciprocally corrupted each other. Since, therefore, in the sacred writings the only specimens of the primeval and genuine poetry are to be found, and since these are not less venerable for their antiquity than for their divine original, I conceived it my duty in the first place to investigate the nature of these writings, as far as might be consistent with the design of this institution: in other words, it is not my intention to expound to the student of theology the oracles of divine truth; but to recommend to the notice of the youth who is addicted to the politer sciences, and studious of the elegancies of composition, some of the first and choicest specimens of poetic taste. The difficulty of the undertaking ought probably to have discouraged me from the attempt; yet with you, Gentlemen, I trust my temerity will find this excuse, namely, that I have undertaken a subject the most noble in itself, and the best adapted to the circumstances of my office. I trust that you will allow me at least the merit of distinguishing what was most worthy of this place and this assembly; though perhaps I have too rashly engaged, without a due consideration of my own abilities. In this disquisition it is my intention to pursue that track which the nature of the subject seems to require. Three points are to be considered in every poem: First, the argument or matter, and the manner of treating it; what disposition, what order, and what general form is adapted to each species of composition: Secondly, the elocution and style; in which are comprehended lively and elevated sentiments, splendour and perspicuity of arrangement, beauty and variety of imagery, and strength and elegance of diction: Lastly, the harmony of the verse or numbers is to be considered, not only as intended to captivate the ear, but as adapted to the subject, and expressive of it, and as calculated to excite corresponding emotions in the soul. We shall now consider what is to be performed in each of these departments, and how far we may with safety, and with any prospect of advantage, engage in a critical examination of the Hebrew Poetry. With respect to the nature of the versification (if I may be allowed to reverse my own arrangement, and to speak of that first, which constituted the last division of my subject) I fear that little can be produced to your satisfaction or my own; since it is manifest not only from the unsuccessful endeavours of the most learned men, but from the nature of the thing itself, that scarcely any real knowledge of the Hebrew versification is now to be attained: and the only merit to which any modern writer can lay claim, is that of distinguishing certain facts (if any there be) from uncertain conjecture, and demonstrating how imperfect our information must of necessity be upon this topic. Were the inquiry, however, concerning the Hebrew metre to be wholly overlooked; yet since some vestiges of verse are discernible, a few observations of a general nature will probably occur, which we shall in the first place slightly advert to, and afterwards, as occasion serves, particularize and explain. That part of these Lectures, on the other hand, which treats of the style of the Hebrew Poetry, will afford very ample scope for disquisition; since it possesses not only all the principal excellencies which are common to Poetry, but possesses many also which are proper and peculiar to itself. In the remaining part, which though first in order and dignity, will be the last to be treated of, we must with diligence, (as considering the difficulty of the subject) and at the same time with caution engage; lest while we wander too much at large in the ample field of Poetry, we should imprudently break in upon the sacred boundaries of Theology. It will be our business on this occasion to distribute the Hebrew poems, according to their different species, into different classes; to consider in each what is most worthy of attention; and perhaps to compare them with those of Greece and Rome, if there be any extant of the same kind. The necessity of inquiring into the nature of the Hebrew verse---The Hebrew poetry proved to be metrical from the alphabetical poems, and from the equality and correspondence of the sentiments; also from the poetical diction ---Some of the most obvious properties of the verse---The rhythm and mode of scanning totally lost: proved from facts--- The poetical conformation of the sentences---The Greek and Latin poetry materially different from the Hebrew, from the very nature of the languages---Hence a peculiar property in the prose versions of the Hebrew poetry, and the attempts to exhibit this poetry in the verse of other languages . On the very first attempt to elucidate the nature of the sacred poetry, a question presents itself uncommonly difficult and obscure, concerning the nature of the Hebrew verse. This question I would indeed gladly have avoided; could I have abandoned it consistently with my design. But since it appears essential to every species of poetry, that it be confined to numbers, and consist of some kind of verse, (for indeed wanting this, it would not only want its most agreeable attributes, but would scarcely deserve the name of poetry) in treating of the Poetry of the Hebrews, it appears absolutely necessary to demonstrate, that those parts at least of the Hebrew writings which we term poetic, are in a metrical form, and to inquire whether any thing be certainly known concerning the nature and principles of this versification or not. This part of my subject therefore I undertake, not as hoping to illustrate it by any new observations, but merely with a view of inquiring whether it will admit of any illustration at all. Even this I shall attempt with brevity and caution, as embarked upon an ocean dishonoured by the shipwreck of many eminent persons, and therefore presuming only to coast along the shore. In the first place (notwithstanding that a contrary opinion has been supported by some of the learned) I think it will be sufficiently apparent, if we but advert to them a little more attentively, that certain of the Hebrew writings are not only animated with the true poetic spirit, but in some degree confined to numbers. For there appear in almost every part of them such marks and vestiges of verse, as could scarcely be expected to remain in any language, after the sound and pronunciation (as is the case with the Hebrew at present) were, through extreme antiquity, become almost totally obsolete. There existed a certain kind of poetry among the Hebrews, principally intended, it should seem, for the assistance of the memory: in which, when there was little connexion between the sentiments, a sort of order or method was preserved, by the initial letters of each line or stanza following the order of the alphabet. Of this there are several examples extant among the sacred poems  23 ; and in these examples the verses are so exactly marked and defined, that it is impossible to mistake them for prose; and particularly if we attentively consider the verses, and compare them with one another, since they are in general so regularly accommodated, that word answers to word, and almost syllable to syllable. This being the case; though an appeal can scarcely be made to the ear on this occasion, the eye itself will distinguish the poetic division and arrangement, and also that some labour and accuracy has been employed in adapting the words to the measure. The Hebrew poetry has likewise another property altogether peculiar to metrical composition. Writers who are confined within the trammels of verse, are generally indulged with the licence of using words in a sense and manner remote from their common acceptation, and in some degree contrary to the analogy of the language; so that sometimes they shorten them by taking from the number of the syllables, and sometimes venture to add a syllable for the sake of adapting them to their immediate purpose. This practice is not only effectual to the facilitating of the versification, but also to the prevention of satiety by varying the sounds, and by imparting to the style a certain peculiar colouring, which elevates it above the language of the vulgar. Poetry therefore always makes use of some such artifice, as accords best with the genius of each language. This is exemplified particularly in two respects: First, in the use of glosses or foreign language; and secondly, in that of certain irregular or less received forms of common words  24 The extreme liberty which the Greeks allowed themselves in these respects is remarkable; and their language, beyond every other, because of the variety and copiousness of the different dialects, which prevailed in the several states of Greece, was peculiarly favourable to it. Next to them none perhaps have admitted these liberties more freely than the Hebrews, who not only by the use of glosses, but by that of anomalous language, and chiefly of certain particles  25 peculiar to metrical composition, and added frequently at the end of words, have so varied their style, as to form to themselves a distinct poetical dialect. Thus far, therefore, I think we may with safety affirm, that the Hebrew poetry is metrical. One or two of the peculiarities also of their versification it may be proper to remark, which as they are very observable in those poems, in which the verses are defined by the initial letters, may at least be reasonably conjectured of the rest. The first of these is, that the verses are very unequal in length; the shortest consisting of six or seven syllables; the longest extending to about twice that number: the same poem is, however, generally continued throughout in verses not very unequal to each other. I must also observe, that the close of the verse generally falls where the members of the sentences are divided  26 . As to the real quantity, the rythm, or modulation, these from the present state of the language seem to be altogether unknown, and even to admit of no investigation by human art or industry. It is indeed evident, that the true Hebrew pronunciation is totally lost. The rules concerning it, which were devised by the modern Jews many ages after the language of their ancestors had fallen into disuse, have been long since suspected by the learned to be destitute of authority and truth: for if in reality the Hebrew language is to be conformed to the positions of these men, we must be under the necessity of confessing, not only, what we at present experience, that the Hebrew poetry possesses no remains of sweetness or harmony, but that it never was possessed of any. The truth is, it was neither possible for them to recal the true pronunciation of a language long since obsolete, and to institute afresh the rules of orthoepy; nor can any person in the present age so much as hope to effect any thing to the purpose by the aid of conjecture, in a matter so remote from our senses, and so involved in obscurity. In this respect, indeed, the delicacy of all languages is most remarkable. After they cease to be spoken, they are still significant of some sound; but that in the mouth of a stranger becomes most dissonant and barbarous: the vital grace is wanting, the native sweetness is gone, the colour of primeval beauty is faded and decayed. The Greek and Latin doubtless have now lost much of their pristine and native sweetness; and as they are spoken, the pronunciation is different in different nations, but every where barbarous, and such as Attic or Roman ears would not have been able to endure. In these, however, the rythm or quantity remains, each retains its peculiar numbers, and the versification is distinct: but the state of the Hebrew is far more unfavourable, which, destitute of vowel sounds, has remained altogether silent (if I may use the expression) incapable of utterance upwards of two thousand years. Thus, not so much as the number of syllables, of which each word consisted, could with any certainty be defined, much less the length or quantity of the syllables: and since the regulation of the metre of any language must depend upon two particulars, I mean the number and the length of the syllables, the knowledge of which is utterly unattainable in the Hebrew, he who attempts to restore the true and genuine Hebrew versification, erects an edifice without a foundation. To some of those indeed who have laboured in this matter, thus much of merit is to be allowed; that they rendered the Hebrew poetry, which formerly sounded uncommonly harsh and barbarous, in some degree softer and more polished; they indeed furnished it with a sort of versification, and metrical arrangement, when baffled in their attempts to discover the real. That we are justified in attributing to them any thing more than this, is neither apparent from the nature of the thing, nor from the arguments with which they attempt to defend their conjectures  27 Their endeavours in truth would rather tend to supersede all inquiry on a subject which the most learned and ingenious have investigated in vain; and induce us to relinquish as lost, what we see cannot be retrieved. But although nothing certain can be defined concerning the metre of the particular verses, there is yet another artifice of poetry to be remarked of them when in a collective state, when several of them are taken together. In the Hebrew poetry, as I before remarked, there may be observed a certain conformation of the sentences, the nature of which is, that a complete sense is almost equally infused into every component part, and that every member constitutes an entire verse. So that as the poems divide themselves in a manner spontaneously into periods, for the most part equal; so the periods themselves are divided into verses, most commonly couplets, though frequently of greater length. This is chiefly observable in those passages, which frequently occur in the Hebrew poetry, in which they treat one subject in many different ways, and dwell upon the same sentiment; when they express the same thing in different words, or different things in a similar form of words; when equals refer to equals, and opposites to opposites: and since this artifice of composition seldom fails to produce even in prose an agreeable and measured cadence, we can scarcely doubt that it must have imparted to their poetry, were we masters of the versification, an exquisite degree of beauty and grace. In this circumstance, therefore, which is common to most of the Hebrew poems, we find, if not a rule and principle, at least a characteristic of the sacred poetry: insomuch that in that language the word Mizmor 28 (or Psalm) according to its etymology, is expressive of a composition cut or divided, in a peculiar manner, into short and equal sentences. The nature of the Greek and Latin poetry is in this respect directly opposite; and that in conformity to the genius of the different languages. For the Greek, beyond every other language, (and the Latin next to it) is copious, flowing, and harmonious, possessed of a great variety of measures, of which the impression is to definite, the effects so striking, that if one should recite some lame and imperfect portion of a verse, or even enunciate hastily several verses in a breath, the numbers would nevertheless be clearly discernible: so that in these every variety essential to poetry and verse may be provided for almost at pleasure, without the smallest injury to the different metres. But in the Hebrew language the whole economy is different. Its form is simple above every other; the radical words are uniform, and resemble each other almost exactly; nor are the inflexions numerous, or materially different: whence we may readily understand, that its metres are neither complex, nor capable of much variety; but rather simple, grave, temperate; less adapted to fluency than dignity and force: so that posibly they found it necessary to distinguish the extent of the verse by the conclusion of the sentence, lest the lines, by running into each other, should become altogether implicated and confused. Two observations occur in this place worthy of attention, and arise naturally from what has been said. The first is, that a poem translated literally from the Hebrew into the prose of any other languge, whilst the same forms of the sentences remain, will still retain, even as far as relates to versification, much of its native dignity, and a faint appearance of versification. This is evident in our common version of the Scriptures, where frequently "The order chang'd, and verse from verse disjoin'd, "Yet still the poet's scatter'd limbs we find:" But the case is very different in literal translations from the Greek or Latin 29 . The other remark, which I wished to recommend to your notice, is, that a Hebrew poem, if translated into Greek or Latin verse, and having the conformation of the sentences accommodated to the idiom of a foreign language, will appear confused and mutilated; will scarcely retain a trace of its genuine elegance, and peculiar beauty. For in exhibiting the works of great poets in another language, much depends upon preserving not only the internal meaning, the force and beauty as far as regards the sense, but even the external lineaments, the proper colour and habit, the movement, and, as it were, the gait of the original. Those, therefore, who have endeavoured to express the beauties of the sacred poets in Greek or Latin verse, have unavoidably failed in the attempt to depict them according to their native genius and character; and have exhibited something, whether inferior or not, certainly very unlike them, both in kind and form; whether, on the other hand, they have been able to approach, in some degree, their energy, their majesty and spirit, is not our present object to consider. ALSO OF THE SENTENTIOUS STYLE. The poetic style of the Hebrews bears the general title of Parabolic--- Its constituent principles are the sententious, the figurative, and the sublime--- The source of the Parabolic style and its original use: among other nations; among the Hebrews---Certain examples of it preserved from the first ages in the writings of Moses .---1. The sententious kind; its nature and effects . THE subject which next presents itself to our investigation, is the Style of the Hebrew poetry. The meaning of this word I do not wish to be restricted to the diction only of the sacred poets, but rather to include their sentiment, their mode of thinking; whence, as from its genuine source, the peculiar character of their composition may be deduced. It will be proper, however, before we proceed, to remark, that as it is the nature of all poetry, so it is particularly of the Hebrew, to be totally different from common language; and not only in the choice of words, but in the construction, to affect a peculiar and more exquisite mode of expression. The truth of this remark will appear from what usually happens to a learner of Hebrew. He, for instance, who is a proficient in the historical books, when he comes to the poetical parts, will find himself almost a perfect stranger. The phraseology, however, peculiar to the poets, the bold ellipses, the sudden transitions of the tenses, genders, and persons, and other similar circumstances, I shall leave to the Grammarian: or rather I shall leave (since I do not find, that the Grammarians acknowledge any distinction between poetical and common language) to be collected from practice and attentive reading. It would be a no less indolent and trifling occupation to post through all those forms of tropes and figures, which the teachers of rhetoric have pompously (not to say uselessly) heaped together; since there is no necesity of applying to the sacred poetry for examples of these, every composition, however trite and barren, abounding in them. Of these, therefore, we shall be sparing, and use them not as freely as we might, but as much only as shall appear absolutely necessary. For at present we are not so much to inquire what are the general principles of poetical composition, as what are the peculiar marks and characters of the Hebrew poetry. Let us consider, therefore, whether the literature of the Hebrews will not suggest some general term, which will give us an opportunity of discussing the subject, so as to bring it under one comprehensive view; and which, being divided according to its constituent parts, will prescribe a proper order and limit to our disquisition. A poem is called in Hebrew Mizmor , that is, as was before remarked, a short composition cut and divided into distinct parts  30 It is thus called in reference to the verse and numbers. Again, a poem is called, in reference to the diction and sentiments, Mashal 31 ; which I take to be the word properly expressive of the poetical style. Many translators render it by the word Parable , which in some respects is not improper, though it scarcely comprehends the full compass of the Hebrew expression; for if we investigate its full and proper force, we shall find that it includes three forms or modes of speech, the sententious, the figurative, and the sublime. To these as parts or divisions of the general subject may be referred whatever occurs concerning the parabolic or poetical style of the Hebrews: but the reason of this arrangement will perhaps be better understood, if we premise a short inquiry into the origin and early use of this style of composition. The origin and first use of poetical language are undoubtedly to be traced into the vehement affections of the mind. For what is meant by that singular frenzy of poets, which the Greeks, ascribing to divine inspiration, distinguished by the appellation of enthusiasm , but a style and expression directly prompted by nature itself, and exhibiting the true and express image of a mind violently agitated? When, as it were, the secret avenues, the interior recesses of the soul are thrown open; when the inmost conceptions are displayed, rushing together in one turbid stream, without order or connexion. Hence sudden exclamations, frequent interrogations, apostrophes even to inanimate objects: for to those, who are violently agitated themselves, the universal nature of things seems under a necessity of being affected with similar emotions. Every impulse of the mind, however, has not only a peculiar style and expression, but a certain tone of voice, and a certain gesture of the body adapted to it: some, indeed, not satisfied with that expression which language affords, have added to it dancing and song; and as we know there existed in the first ages a very strict connexion between these arts and that of poetry, we may possibly be indebted to them for the accurately admeasured verses and feet, to the end that the modulation of the language might accord with the music of the voice, and the motion of the body. Poetry, in this its rude origin and commencement, being derived from nature, was in time improved by art, and applied to the purposes of utility and delight. For as it owed its birth to the affections of the mind, and had availed itself of the assistance of harmony, it was found, on account of the exact and vivid delineation of the objects which it described, to be excellently adapted to the exciting of every internal emotion, and making a more forcible impression upon the mind than abstract reasoning could possibly effect; it was found capable of interesting and affecting the senses and passions, of captivating the ear, of directing the perception to the minutest circumstances, and of assisting the memory in the retention of them. Whatever therefore deserved to be generally known and accurately remembered, was (by those men, who on this very account were denominated wise 32 ) adorned with a jocund and captivating style, illuminated with the varied and splendid colouring of language, and moulded into sentences comprehensive, pointed, and harmonious. It became the peculiar province of poetry to depict the great, the beautiful, the becoming, the virtuous; to embellish and recommend the precepts of religion and virtue, to transmit to posterity excellent and sublime actions and sayings; to celebrate the works of the Deity, his beneficence, his wisdom; to record the memorials of the past, and the predictions of the future. In each of these departments Poetry was of singular utility, since before any characters expressive of sounds were invented, at least before they were commonly received, and applied to general use, it seems to have afforded the only means of preserving the rude science of the early times; and in this respect, to have rendered the want of letters more tolerable: it seems also to have acted the part of a public herald, by whose voice each memorable transaction of antiquity was proclaimed and transmitted through different ages and nations. Such appears by the testimony of authors to have been the undoubted origin of Poetry among heathen nations. It is evident that Greece for several successive ages was possessed of no records but the poetic: for the first who published a prose oration was Pherecydes, a man of the isle of Syrus, and contemporary with King Cyrus, who lived some ages posterior to that of Homer and Hesiod: somewhat after that time Cadmus the Milesian  33 began to compose history. The laws themselves were metrical, and adapted to certain musical notes: such were the laws of Charondas, which were sung at the banquets of the Athenians  34 : such were those which were delivered by the Cretans  35 to the ingenuous youth to be learned by rote, with accompaniments of musical melody, in order that by the enchantment of harmony, the sentiments might be more forcibly impressed upon their memories. Hence certain poems were denominated ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  (nomoi) which implied convivial or banqueting songs, as is remarked by Aristotle  36 ; who adds, that the same custom of chanting the laws to music, existed even in his own time among the Agathyrsi  37 . If we may credit Strabo  38 , the Turdetani, a people of Spain, had laws in verse. But the Germans  39 , as Tacitus positively asserts, had no records or annals but the traditional poems, in which they celebrated the heroic exploits of their ancestors  40 . In the same manner, and on the same account, the Persians, the Arabs, and many of the most ancient of the Eastern nations, preserved in verse their history and politics, as well as the principles of religion and morals: Thus all science human and divine was deposited in the treasury of the Muses, and thither it was necessary on every occasion to report  41 . The only mode of instruction, indeed, adapted to human nature in an uncivilized state, when the knowledge of letters was very little, if at all diffused, must be that which is calculated to captivate the ear and the passions, which assists the memory, which is not to be delivered into the hand, but infused into the mind and heart  42 . That the case was the same among the Hebrews; that poetry was both anciently and generally known and practised by them, appears highly probable, as well from the analogy of things, as from some vestiges of poetic language extant in the writings of Moses. The first instance occurs in one of the most remote periods of the Mosaic history, I mean the address of Lamech to his wives, which is indeed but ill understood in general, because the occasion of it is very obscurely intimated: nevertheless, if we consider the apt construction of the words, the exact distribution of the period into three distichs, and the two parallel, and as it were corresponding, sentiments in each distich; I apprehend it will easily be acknowledged an indubitable specimen of the poetry of the first ages: "Hadah and Sillah hear my voice; "Ye wives of Lamech hearken to my speech; "For I have slain a man, because of my wounding; "A young man, because of my hurt. "If Cain shall be avenged  43 seven times, "Certainly Lamech seventy and seven  44 ." Another example, which I shall point out to you, appears no less to bear the genuine marks of poetry than the former, and that is the execration of Noah upon Ham; with the magnificent predictions of prosperity to his two brothers, to Shem in particular, and the ardent breathings of his soul for their future happiness: these are expressed in three equal divisions of verses, concluding with an indignant repetition of one of the preceding lines: "Cursed be Canaan! "A servant of servants to his brothers let him be! "Blessed be Jehovah the God of Shem! "And let Canaan be their servant! "May God extend Japheth, "And may he dwell in the tents of Shem! "And let Canaan be their servant  45 ." The inspired benedictions of the patriarchs Isaac and Jacob are altogether of the same kind  46 : and the great importance of these prophecies, not only to the destiny of the people of Israel, but to that of the whole human race, renders it highly probable that they were extant in this form before the time of Moses; and that they were afterwards committed to writing by the inspired historian, exactly as he had received them from his ancestors, without presuming to bestow on these sacred oracles any adventitious ornaments or poetical colouring. The matter will appear yet clearer, if we advert to some other verses, a little different in kind, to which the same historian appeals (as well known and popular) in testimony of the truth of his narration. Thus, when he relates the first incursion of the Israelites into the country of the Amorites, in order to mark more precisely the boundaries of that state, and to explain more satisfactorily the nature of the victories not long before atchieved over the Moabites, he cites two fragments of poems; the one from the book of the Wars of Jehovah  47 , the other from the Sayings ( Mashalim ) of those who spoke in parables  48 ; that is, as appears from the nature of things, from some panegyrical or triumphal poem of the Amorites. To which we may add, what immediately follow, the prophecies of Balaam the Mesopotamian, pronounced also in the parabolic style, as appears from the extreme neatness of the composition, the metrical and parallel sentences, the sublimity of the language and sentiment, and the uncommon elegance of the verse. Hence it is easy to collect, that this kind of poetry, which appears perfectly analogous to all the rest of the Hebrew poetry that still remains, was neither originally the production of Moses, nor peculiar to the Jewish nation, but that it may be accounted among the first-fruits of human ingenuity, and was cultivated by the Hebrews and other Eastern nations from the first ages, as the recorder of events, the preceptor of morals, the historian of the past, and prophet of the future  49 . Concerning the utility of poetry, therefore, the Hebrews have maintained the same opinion throughout all ages. This being always accounted the highest commendation of science and erudition; "To understand a proverb and the interpretation; the words of the wise and their dark sayings  50 ;" under which titles two species of poetry seem to be particularly indicated, different indeed in many respects, yet agreeing in some. The one I call didactic , which expresses some moral precept in elegant and pointed verses, often illustrated by a comparison either direct or implied; similar to the ![](/images/inline/gtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  (Gnomai) and adages of the wise men: the other was truly poetical, adorned with all the more splendid colouring of language, magnificently sublime in the sentiments, animated by the most pathetic expression, and diversified and embellished by figurative diction and poetical imagery; such are almost all the remaining productions of the Prophets. Brevity or conciseness was a characteristic of each of these forms of composition, and a degree of obscurity was not unfrequently attendant upon this studied brevity. Each consisted of metrical sentences; on which account chiefly the poetic and proverbial language seem to have obtained the same appellation: and in these two kinds of composition all knowledge human and divine was thought to be comprized. The sententious style, therefore, I define to be the primary characteristic of the Hebrew poetry, as being the most conspicuous and comprehensive of all. For although that style seems naturally adapted only to the didactic, yet it is found to pervade the whole of the poetry of the Hebrews. There are indeed many passages in the sacred writings highly figurative, and infinitely sublime; but all of them manifestly assume a sententious form. There are some too, and those not inelegant, which possess little more of the characteriftics of poetry than the versification, and that terseness or adaptation of the sentences, which constitutes so important a part even of the harmony of verse. This is manifest in most of the didactic psalms, as well as in some others, the matter, order, diction, and thoughts of which are clearly historical; but the conformation of the sentences wholly poetical. There is indeed so strict an analogy between the structure of the sentences and the versification, that when the former chances to be confused or obscured, it is scarcely possible to form a conjecture concerning the division of the lines or verses, which is almost the only part of the Hebrew versification that remains. It was therefore necessary, before I could explain the mechanism of the Hebrew verse, to remark many particulars, which properly belong to the present topic. The reason of this (not to detain you with what is obvious in almost every page of the sacred poetry) is as follows. The Hebrew poets frequently express a sentiment with the utmost brevity and simplicity, illustrated by no circumstances, adorned with no epithets (which in truth they seldom use); they afterwards call in the aid of ornament; they repeat, they vary, they amplify the same sentiment; and adding one or more sentences which run parallel to each other, they express the same or a similar, and often a contrary sentiment in nearly the same form of words. Of these three modes of ornament at least they make the most frequent use, namely, the amplification of the same ideas, the accumulation of others, and the opposition or antithesis of such as are contrary to each other; they dispose the corresponding sentences in regular distichs adapted to each other, and of an equal length, in which, for the most part, things answer to things, and words to words, as the Son of Sirach says of the works of God, two and two, one against the other 51 These forms again are diversified by notes of admiration, comparison, negation, and more particularly interrogation, whence a singular degree of force and elevation is frequently added to the composition. Each language possesses a peculiar genius and character, on which depend the principles of the versification, and in a great measure the style or colour of the poetic diction. In Hebrew the frequent or rather perpetual splendour of the sentences, and the accurate recurrence of the clauses, seem absolutely necessary to distinguish the verse: so that what in any other language would appear a superfluous and tiresome repetition, in this cannot be omitted without injury to the poetry. This excellence therefore the sententious style possesses in the Hebrew poetry, that it necessarily prevents a prosaic mode of expression, and always reduces a composition to a kind of metrical form. For, as Cicero remarks, "in certain forms of expression there exists such a degree of conciseness, that a sort of metrical arrangement follows of course. For when words or sentences directly correspond, or when contraries are opposed exactly to each other, or even when words of a similar sound run parallel, the composition will in general have a metrical cadence  52 ." It possesses, however, great force in other respects, and produces several great and remarkable beauties of composition. For, as the sacred poems derive from this source a great part of their elegance, harmony, and splendour, so they are not unfrequently indebted to it for their sublimity and strength. Frequent and laconic sentences render the composition remarkably concise, harmonious, and animated; the brevity itself imparts to it additional strength, and being contracted within a narrower space, it has a more energetic and pointed effect. Examples sufficient to evince the truth of these remarks will occur hereafter in the passages which will be quoted in illustration of other parts of our subject: and, in all probability, on a future occasion the nature of my undertaking will require a more ample discussion of this subject  53 . 2\. The Figurative Style; to be treated rather according to the genius of the Hebrew poetry than according to the forms and arrangements of Rhetoricians--- The definition and constituent parts of the Figurative Style , Metaphor , treating the subject: difficulties in reading the Hebrew poetry, which result from the Figurative Style; how to be avoided . 1. Of the Metaphor , including a general disquisition concerning poetic imagery: the nature of which is explained; and four principal sources pointed out: Nature, Common Life, Religion, History . IN my last Lecture I offered it as my opinion, that the Hebrew word expressive of the poetic style had not one simple and distinct meaning, but might commodiously enough be supposed to admit of three constituent parts or divisions: in other words, that it might imply the sententious , the figurative , and the sublime . On the sententious style its nature, origin, and effect in the Hebrew poetry, I offered such brief remarks as occurred to me at the time: and now that I am about to treat of the figurative style, I observe before me an infinity of matter and an ample field; in which lest we should too freely expatiate, or irregularly wander, the scope and order of our journey, the outlets of the road, the circuitous paths, and the most direct avenues, are in the first place to be carefully investigated. In order to the full comprehension also of those matters which will be treated of in this part, for they are in some degree remote from common use, it may not be improper previously to explain as clearly as possible, and therefore with some degree of copiousness, my immediate design; on what principles, in what order and method, and to what end I mean to treat of the figures which are chiefly employed in the Hebrew poetry. The word Mashal , in its most common acceptation, denotes resemblance, and is therefore directly expressive of the figurative style, as far as the nature of figures consists in the substitution of words, or rather of ideas, for those which they resemble; which is the case even with most of the figures that have been remarked by the Rhetoricians. This definition therefore of the figurative style, drawn both from the writings of the Hebrews, and the sense of the word itself, I mean to follow in explaining the nature of their poetry: and this I do the more willingly, because it will enable me to confine our investigation within narrower limits. I shall also venture to omit the almost innumerable forms of the Greek Rhetoricians, who possessed the faculty of inventing names in the highest perfection; I shall neglect even their primary distinction between tropes and figures  54 and their subdivisions of the figures themselves, denominating some figures of expression, and some figures of sentiment. In disregarding these distinctions, I might in my own justification alledge the authority of C. Artorius Proculus, who gave the name of figure to a trope, as Quintilian informs us; and indeed the example of Quintilian himself  55 . I omit them, however, upon a different ground; for I do not pretend to say that in their proper place they are destitute either of reality or use: but our present concern is not to explain the sentiments of the Greek but of the Hebrew writers. By figurative language, I would be understood to mean that, in which one or more images or words are substituted in the room of others, or even introduced by way of illustration upon the principle of resemblance. That resemblance, if it be only intimated, and confined to a few words, is called a Metaphor ; if the figure be continued, it is called an Allegory ; if it be directly expressed by comparing the ideas together, and by the insertion of any words expressive of likeness, it is called Simile or Comparison 56 . On the same principle of resemblance the Prosopop oeia , or Personification, is also founded, when a character and person is assigned even to things inanimate or fictitious (which is a bolder species of metaphor) or when a probable but fictitious speech is attributed to a real personage. I mean, therefore, to treat of these figures in the order just now proposed; not as supposing them the only figures made use of by the Hebrew poets  57 ; but in the first place, because they chiefly come within the definition of the parabolic style; because too they most frequently occur in the sacred poetry, and constitute some of its greatest beauties: insomuch that their true force and energy is in no other compositions so apparent. I must add, that it will not be sufficient to illustrate them barely by producing a few examples, as if matters uncommon and abstruse were the object of our inquiry, and not such as spontaneously occur on almost every occasion. It will be necessary to proceed still further if possible; it will be necessary to inquire whether there was any mode of using them peculiar to the Hebrews; the particular and interior elegancies of them are to be investigated: and to this object of our pursuit we shall not, I apprehend, find any easier access, than by that track, which the nature of the subject itself obviously indicates to us. It is the peculiar design of the figurative style, taken in the sense in which I have explained it, to exhibit objects in a clearer or more striking, in a sublimer or more forcible manner. Since, therefore, whatever is employed with a view to the illustration and elevation of another subject, ought itself to be as familiar and obvious, at the same time as grand and magnificent as possible, it becomes necessary to adduce images from those objects, with which both the writers and the persons they address are well acquainted, and which have been constantly esteemed of the highest dignity and importance. On the other hand, if the reader be accustomed to habits of life totally different from those of the author, and be conversant only with different objects; in that case many descriptions and sentiments, which were clearly illustrated and magnificently expressed by the one, will appear to the other mean and obscure, harsh and unnatural: and this will be the case more or less, in proportion as they differ or are more remote from each other in time, situation, customs sacred or profane, in fine, in all the forms of public and private life. On this account difficulties must occur in the perusal of almost every work of literature, and particularly in poetry, where every thing is depicted and illustrated with the greatest variety and abundance of imagery; they must be still more numerous in such of the poets as are foreign and ancient; in the Orientals above all foreigners, they being the farthest removed from our customs and manners; and of all the Orientals more especially in the Hebrews, theirs being confessedly the most ancient compositions extant. To all who apply themselves to the study of their poetry, for the reasons which I have enumerated, difficulties and inconveniencies must necessarily occur. Not only the antiquity of these writings forms a principal obstruction in many respects; but the manner of living, of speaking, of thinking, which prevailed in those times, will be found altogether different from our customs and habits. There is therefore great danger, lest viewing them from an improper situation, and rashly estimating all things by our own standard, we form an erroneous judgment. Of this kind of mistake we are to be always aware, and these inconveniencies are to be counteracted by all possible diligence: nor is it enough to be acquainted with the language of this people, their manners, discipline, rites and ceremonies; we must even investigate their inmost sentiments, the manner and connexion of their thoughts; in one word, we must see all things with their eyes, estimate all things by their opinions: we must endeavour as much as possible to read Hebrew as the Hebrews would have read it. We must act as the Astronomers with regard to that branch of their science which is called comparative, who, in order to form a more perfect idea of the general system, and its different parts, conceive themselves as passing through, and surveying the whole universe, migrating from one planet to another, and becoming for a short time inhabitants of each. Thus they clearly contemplate, and accurately estimate what each possesses peculiar to itself with respect to situation, celerity, satellites, and its relation to the rest; thus they distinguish what and how different an appearance of the universe is exhibited according to the different situations from which it is contemplated. In like manner, he who would perceive and feel the peculiar and interior elegancies of the Hebrew poetry, must imagine himself exactly situated as the persons for whom it was written, or even as the writers themselves; he must not attend to the ideas which on a cursory reading certain words would obtrude upon his mind; he is to feel them as a Hebrew, hearing or delivering the same words, at the same time, and in the same country. As far as he is able to pursue this plan, so far he will comprehend their force and excellence. This indeed in many cases it will not be easy to do; in some it will be impossible; in all, however, it ought to be regarded, and in those passages particularly in which the figurative style is found to prevail. In the Metaphor for instance (and what I remark concerning it may be applied to all the rest of the figures, since they are all naturally allied to each other) two circumstances are to be especially regarded, on which its whole force and elegance will depend: first, that resemblance which is the ground- work of the figurative and parabolic style, and which will perhaps be sufficiently apparent, even from a common and indistinct knowledge of the objects; and secondly, the beauty or dignity of the idea which is substituted for another; and this is a circumstance of unusual nicety. An opinion of grace and dignity results frequently, not so much from the objects themselves, in which these qualities are supposed to exist, as from the disposition of the spectator; or from some slight and obscure relation or connexion which they have with some other things. Thus it sometimes happens, that the external form and lineaments may be sufficiently apparent, though the original and intrinsic beauty and elegance be totally erased by time. For these reasons, it will perhaps not be an useless undertaking, when we treat of the Metaphors of the sacred poets, to enter more fully into the nature of their poetical imagery in general, of which the Metaphor constitutes so principal a part. By this mode of proceeding, we shall be enabled not only to discern the general beauty and elegance of this figure in the Hebrew poetry, but the peculiar elegance, which it frequently possesses, if we only consider how forcible it must have appeared to those for whom it was originally intended; and what a connexion and agreement these figurative expressions must have had with their circumstances, feelings, and opinions. Thus many expressions and allusions, which even now appear beautiful, must, when considered in this manner, shine with redoubled lustre; and many, which now strike the superficial reader as coarse, mean, or deformed, must appear graceful, elegant, and sublime. The whole course of nature, this immense universe of things, offers itself to human contemplation, and affords an infinite variety, a confused assemblage, a wilderness, as it were, of images, which being collected as the materials of poetry, are selected and produced as occasion dictates. The mind of man is that mirror of Plato  58 , which as he turns about at pleasure, and directs to a different point of view, he creates another sun, other stars, planets, animals, and even another self. In this shadow or image of himself, which man beholds when the mirror is turned inward towards himself, he is enabled in some degree to contemplate the souls of other men: for, from what he feels and perceives in himself, he forms conjectures concerning others; and apprehends and describes the manners, affections, conceptions of others from his own. Of this assemblage of images, which the human mind collects from all nature, and even from itself, that is, from its own emotions and operations, the least clear and evident are those which are explored by reason and argument; the more evident and distinct are those which are formed from the impressions made by external objects on the senses; and of these, the clearest and most vivid are those which are perceived by the eye. Hence poetry abounds most in those images which are furnished by the senses, and chiefly those of the sight; in order to depict the obscure by the more manifest, the subtile by the more substantial; and, as far as simplicity is its object, it pursues those ideas which are most familiar and most evident; of which there is such an abundance, that they serve as well the purpose of ornament and variety, as that of illustration. Those images or pictures of external objects, which like lights adorn and distinguish the poetic diction, are indeed infinite in number. In an immensity of matter, however, that we may be enabled to pursue some kind of order, and not wander in uncertainty and doubt, we may venture to fix upon four sources of these ideas, whither all that occur may be commodiously referred. Thus, poetical imagery may be derived first, from natural objects; secondly, from the manners, arts, and circumstances of common life; thirdly, from things sacred; and lastly, from the more remarkable facts recorded in sacred history. From each of these topics a few cases will be selected, and illustrated by examples, which though chiefly of the Metaphorical kind, will yet be in a great measure applicable to the other figures which have been specified; these we shall afterwards take an opportunity to explain, when not only the figures themselves will be noticed, but also the different forms and rules for their introduction and embellishment. OF POETIC IMAGERY FROM THE OBJECTS OF NATURE. The frequent use of the Metaphor renders a style magnificent, but often obscure: the Hebrew poets have accomplisbed the sublime without losing perspicuity---Three causes assigned for this singular fact: first, the imagery which they introduce is in general derived from familiar objects: again, in the use and accommodation of it they pursue a certain custom and analogy: lastly, they make the most free use of that which is most familiar, and the nature and extent of which is most generally known---These observations confirmed by examples (1.) from natural objects: such as are common to mankind in general; such as are more familiar to the Hebrews than to others; and such as are peculiar to them . "THE great excellence of the poetic dialect," as Aristotle most judiciously remarks, "consists in perspicuity without meanness. Familiar terms and words in common use form a clear and perspicuous, but frequently a low style; unusual or foreign expressions give it an air of grandeur, but frequently render it obscure  59 ." Of those which he calls foreign, the principal force lies in the Metaphor; but "as the temperate and reasonable use of this figure enlivens a composition, so the frequent introduction of Metaphors obscures it, and if they very commonly occur, it will be little better than an enigma  60 ." If the Hebrew poets be examined by the rules and precepts of this great philosopher and critic, it will readily be allowed, that they have assiduously attended to the sublimity of their compositions by the abundance and splendour of their figures; though it may be doubted whether they might not have been more temperate in the use of them. For in those poems at least, in which something of uncommon grandeur and sublimity is aimed at, there predominates a perpetual, I had almost said a continued use of the Metaphor, sometimes daringly introduced, sometimes rushing in with imminent hazard of propriety. A Metaphor thus licentiously intruded, is frequently continued to an immoderate extent. The Orientals are attached to this style of composition; and many flights which our ears, too fastidious perhaps in these respects, will scarcely bear, must be allowed to the general freedom and boldness of these writers. But if we examine the sacred poems, and consider at the same time that a great degree of obscurity must result from the total oblivion in which many sources of their imagery must be involved; of which many examples are to be found in the Song of Solomon, as well as in other parts of the sacred writings; we shall, I think, find cause to wonder that in writings of so great antiquity, and in such an unlimited use of figurative expression, there should yet appear so much purity and perspicuity, both in sentiment and language. In order to explore the real cause of this remarkable fact, and to explain more accurately the genius of the parabolic style, I shall premise a few observations concerning the use of the Metaphor in the Hebrew poetry; which I trust will be sufficiently clear to those who peruse it with attention, and which I think in general are founded in truth. In the first place, the Hebrew poets frequently make use of imagery borrowed from common life and from objects well known and familiar. On this the perspicuity of figurative language will be found in a great measure to depend: For a principal use of Metaphors is to illustrate the subject by a tacit comparison; but if instead of familiar ideas, we introduce such as are new, and not perfectly understood; if we endeavour to demonstrate what is plain by what is occult, instead of making a subject clearer, we render it more perplexed and difficult. To obviate this inconvenience, we must take care, not only to avoid the violent and too frequent use of Metaphors, but also not to introduce such as are obscure and but slightly related. From these causes, and especially from the latter, arises the difficulty of the Latin satyrist Persius; and but for the uncommon accuracy of the sacred poets in this respect, we should now be scarcely able to comprehend a single word of their productions. In the next place, the Hebrews not only deduce their Metaphors from familiar, or well-known objects, but preserve one constant track and manner in the use and accommodation of them to their subject. The parabolic may indeed be accounted a peculiar style, in which things moral, political, and divine, are marked and represented by comparisons implied or expressed and adopted from sensible objects. As in common and plain language, therefore, certain words serve for signs of certain ideas; so for the most part, in the parabolic style, certain natural images serve to illustrate certain ideas more abstruse and refined. This assertion indeed is not to be understood absolutely without exception; but thus far at least we may affirm, that the sacred poets in illustrating the same subject, make a much more constant use of the same imagery than other poets are accustomed to: and this practice has a surprizing effect in preserving perspicuity. I must observe in the last place, that the Hebrews employ more freely and more daringly that imagery in particular, which is borrowed from the most obvious and familiar objects, and the figurative effect of which is established and defined by general and constant use. This, as it renders a composition clear and luminous, even where there is the greatest danger of obscurity; so it shelters effectually the sacred poets from the imputation of exuberance, harshness, or bombast  61 . In order to confirm and illustrate by examples what has been briefly set forth in the preceding remarks, I shall proceed to consider a few instances of Metaphors derived from natural objects  62 , and such as are most in use: This I shall do in such a manner, that whatever observations occur upon one or two of them, may be applied to many other instances. The images of light and darkness are commonly made use of in all languages to imply or denote prosperity and adversity, agreeably to the common sense and perception which all men have of the objects themselves. But the Hebrews employ those Metaphors more frequently, and with less variation than other people; indeed they seldom refrain from them whenever the subject requires, or will even admit of their introduction. These expressions, therefore, may be accounted among those forms of speech, which in the parabolic style are established and defined; since they exhibit the most noted and familiar images, and the application of them on this occasion is justified by an acknowledged analogy, and approved by constant and unvarying custom. In the use of images, so conspicuous and so familiar among the Hebrews, a degree of boldness is excusable. The Latins introduce them more sparingly, and therefore are more cautious in the application of them: Restore, great Chief, thy country's light! Dispel the dreary shades of night! Thy aspect like the spring shall cheer, And brighter suns shall gild the year  63 . The most respectable of the Roman Muses have scarcely any thing more elegant, I will add at the same time that they have scarcely any thing bolder on any similar occasion. But the Hebrews, upon a subject more sublime indeed in itself, and illustrating it by an idea which was more habitual to them, more daringly exalt their strains, and give a loose rein to the spirit of poetry. They display, for instance, not the image of the Spring, of Aurora, of the dreary Night, but the Sun and Stars as rising with increased splendour in a new creation, or again involved in chaos and primeval darkness. Does the sacred bard promise to his people a renewal of the divine favour, and a recommencement of universal prosperity? In what magnificent colours does he depict it! such indeed as no translation can illustrate, but such as none can obscure: "The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun  64 , "And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold  65 ." But even this is not sufficient: "No longer shalt thou have the sun for thy light by day; "Nor by night shall the brightness of the moon enlighten thee: "For Jehovah shall be to thee an everlasting light, "And thy God shall be thy glory. "Thy sun shall no mor decline; "Neither shall thy moon wane; "For Jehovah shall be thine everlasting light; "And the days of thy mourning shall cease  66 ." In another place he has admirably diversified the same sentiment: "And the moon shall be confounded, and the sun shall be ashamed; "For Jehovah God of Hosts shall reign "On mount Sion, and in Jerusalem; "And before his antients shall he be glorified  67 ." On the other hand, denouncing ruin against the proud King of Egypt: "And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heavens, "And the stars thereof will I make dark; "I will involve the sun in a cloud, "Nor shall the moon give out her light. "All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, "And I will set darkness upon thy land, faith the Lord Jehovah 68 ." These expressions are bold and daring: but the imagery is well known, the use of it is common, the signification definite; they are therefore perspicuous, clear, and truly magnificent. There are, moreover, other images from natural objects, which although in some measure common to other nations as well as the Hebrews, are nevertheless, from the situation and nature of the country, much better known and more familiar to them. There is no metaphor more frequent in the sacred poems, than that by which sudden and great calamities are expressed under the figure of a deluge of waters. This metaphor seems to have been remarkably familiar to the Hebrews, as if directly taken from the nature and state of the country. The river Jordan was immediately before their eyes  69 , which annually overflowed its banks; for the snows of Lebanon and the neighbouring mountains being melted in the beginning of the summer, the waters of the river were often suddenly augmented by the torrents which burst forth from them. The whole country of Palestine  70 indeed was watered by very few perennial currents; but being chiefly mountainous, was exposed to frequent floods, rushing violently along the valleys and narrow passages, after great tempests of rain, which periodically took place at certain seasons: and on this account Moses  71 himself commends to the Israelites the country which they were about to invade, as being totally different from every thing they had experienced in Egypt, or in the desert of Arabia. This image, therefore, though known to all poets and adopted by most, may be accounted peculiarly familiar, local in a manner to the Hebrews, and of consequence we cannot wonder at its frequent introduction, into their compositions. The Prophet seems to have depicted the face of nature exactly as it appeared to him, and to have adapted it to the figurative description of his own situation, when from the banks of Jordan, and the mountains at the head of that river, he pours forth the tempestuous violence of his sorrow with a force of language and an energy of expression, which has been seldom equalled: "Deep calleth unto deep, in the voice of thy cataracts; "All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me  72 ." It may not be improper to remark in this place, that though this metaphor is so usual in all the other sacred writers, whenever an occasion presents itself of introducing it, the author of Job, in the whole of that poem, which from the nature of the subject presented excellent opportunities of employing it, has not more than twice  73 , and then but slightly, made the least allusion to it. Nature, indeed, presented a different aspect to the author, whoever he was, of that most noble poem, if, as many learned men conjecture, it was composed in some part of Arabia, for which, I confess, there is great appearance of argument, from that famous simile  74 , in which he compares his friends with the persidious brook; a comparison manifestly taken from the rocky parts of Arabia, and adorned by many images proper to that region. Finally, there is a species of imagery derived also from natural objects, altogether peculiar to the Hebrews. Among the mountains of Palestine, the most remarkable, and consequently the most celebrated in the sacred poetry, are Mount Lebanon and Mount Carmel. The one, remarkable as well for its height as for its age, magnitude, and the abundance of the cedars which adorned its summit, exhibiting a striking and substantial appearance of strength and majesty. The other, rich and fruitful, abounding with vines, olives, and delicious fruits, in a most flourishing state both by nature and cultivation, and displaying a delightful appearance of fertility, beauty, and grace. The different form and aspect of these two mountains is most accurately defined by Solomon, when he compares the manly dignity with Lebanon  75 , and the beauty and delicacy of the female with Carmel. Each of them suggests a different general image, which the Hebrew poets adopt for different purposes, expressing that by a metaphor, which more timid writers would delineate by a direct comparison. Thus Lebanon is used, by a very bold figure, for the whole people of the Jews, or for the state of the Church  76 ; for Jerusalem  77 ; for the temple of Jerusalem  78 ; for the king of Assyria  79 even, and for his army; for whatever in a word is remarkable, august, and sublime  80 : and in the same manner whatever possesses much fertility, wealth, or beauty, is called Carmel  81 . Thus too, by the fat rams, heifers, and bulls of Basan  82 , by the wild beast of the reeds  83 , or lion of Jordan, are denoted the insolent and cruel tyrants of the Gentiles. In this and other imagery of the same kind, though the sacred writers presume to attempt what would not be allowed in the Greek and Latin poets, yet they cannot be accused of any deficiency in perspicuity or elegance, especially if it be remembered that the objects which furnished them with this imagery were all familiar, or, if I may be allowed the expression, indigenous to the Hebrews. In a word, we may generally remark upon this head, that all poetry, and particularly that of the Hebrews, deduces its principal ornaments or imagery from natural objects: and since these images are formed in the mind of each writer, and expressed conformably to what occurs to his senses, it cannot otherwise happen, but that through diversity of situation, some will be more familiar, some almost peculiar to certain nations; and even those which seem most general, will always have some latent connexion with their immediate origin, and with their native soil. It is the first duty of a critic, therefore, to remark, as far as is possible, the situation and habits of the author, the natural history of his country, and the scene of the poem. Unless we continually attend to these points, we shall scarcely be able to judge with any degree of certainty concerning the elegance or propriety of the sentiments: the plainest will sometimes escape our observation; the peculiar and interior excellencies will remain totally concealed  84 . Examples of poetical imagery from common life---The habits of life extremely simple among the Hebrews, whose principal employments were agriculture and pasturage---The dignity of these employments; and the splendour of the imagery which is borrowed from them: Threshing, and the threshing instruments ---The sublimity of the imagery which is taken from familiar objects results from its propriety. The poetic hell of the Hebrews explained; the imagery of which is borrowed from their subterraneous sepulchres and funeral rites . poets to preserve in their figurative style the most perfect union between perspicuity and sublimity. I remarked in the first place, that they chiefly employed images taken from familiar objects, such I mean as were generally known and understood; secondly, that in the use or application of them, they observed a regular track, method, or analogy; and lastly, that they used most freely that kind of imagery which was most familiar, and the application of which was most generally understood. The truth of these observations will I think find further and more decisive confirmation, if those metaphors be considered, which are taken from arts, manners, and common life. These, you will easily recollect, I before pointed out as another source of poetical imagery: and for this part of the subject a few general observations will suffice, with an example or two out of the great number which present themselves in the sacred writings. The whole course and method of common or domestic life among the Hebrews of the more ancient times, was simple and uniform in the greatest degree. There existed not that variety of studies and pursuits, of arts, conditions, and employments, which may be observed among other nations, who boast of superior civilization; and rightly, indeed, if luxury, levity, and pride, be the criterions of it. All enjoyed the same equal liberty; all of them, as being the offspring of the same ancient stock, boasted an equality of lineage and rank; there were no empty titles, no ensigns of false glory; scarcely any distinction or precedence but that which resulted from superior virtue or conduct, from the dignity of age and experience, or from services rendered to their country. Separated from the rest of mankind by their religion and laws, and not at all addicted to commerce, they were contented with those arts, which were necessary to a simple and uncultivated (or rather uncorrupted) state of life. Thus their principal employments were agriculture and the care of cattle; they were a nation of husbandmen and shepherds. The lands had been originally parcelled out to the different families; the portions of which (by the laws of the country) could not be alienated by sale 85 , and therefore descended to their posterity without diminution. The fruits of the earth, the produce of his land and labour, constituted the wealth of each individual. Not even the greatest among them esteemed it mean and disgraceful to be employed in the lowest offices of rural labour. In the Scripture history, therefore, we read of eminent persons called to the highest and most sacred offices, heroes, kings, and prophets, from the plough and from the stalls  86 . Such being the state of things, we cannot reasonably be surprized to find the Hebrew writers deducing most of their metaphors from those arts particularly, in which they were educated from their earliest years. We are not to wonder that those objects which were most familiar to their senses afforded the principal ornaments of their poetry; especially since they furnished so various and so elegant an assortment of materials, that not only the beautiful, but the grand and magnificent might be collected from them. If any person of more nicety than judgment should esteem some of these rustic images groveling or vulgar, it may be of some use to him to be informed, that such an effect can only result from the ignorance of the critic, who, through the medium of his scanty information and peculiar prejudices, presumes to estimate matters of the most remote antiquity  87 ; it cannot reasonably be attributed as an error to the sacred poets, who not only give to those ideas all their natural force and dignity, but frequently by the vivacity and boldness of the figure, exhibit them with additional vigour, ornament, and beauty. It would be a tedious task to instance particularly with what embellishments of diction, derived from one low and trivial object, (as it may appear to some) the barn, or the threshing-floor, the sacred writers have contrived to add a lustre to the most sublime, and a force to the most important subjects: Thus " Jehovah threshes out the heathen "as corn, tramples them under his feet, and disperses them. He delivers the nations to Israel to be beaten in pieces by an indented flail  88 , or to be crushed by their brazen hoofs. He scatters his enemies like chaff upon the mountains  89 , and disperses them with the whirlwind of his indignation  90 ." "Behold I have made thee a threshing wain; "A new corn-drag armed with pointed teeth: "Thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, "And reduce the hills to chaff. "Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall bear them away; "And the tempest shall scatter them abroad  91 ." Of these quotations it is to be remarked, first, that the nature of this metaphor, and the mode of applying it, are constantly and cautiously regarded by the different authors of the sacred poems; and on this account, notwithstanding the boldness of it, both chastity and perspicuity are preserved: since they apply it solely to exaggerate the slaughter and dispersion of the wicked. The force and aptness of the image itself in illustrating the subject, will also afford a very proper and ready apology for some degree of freedom in the application of it, particularly if we advert to the nature and method of this rustic operation in Palestine. It was performed in a high situation exposed to the wind, by bruising the ear, either by driving in upon the sheaves a herd of cattle, or else by an instrument constructed of large planks, and sharpened underneath with stones or iron; and sometimes by a machine in the form of a cart, with iron wheels or axles indented, which Varro calls Poenicum 92 , as being brought to Italy by the Carthaginians from Phoenicia, which was adjacent to Palestine. From this it is plain (not to mention that the descriptions agree in every particular) that the same custom was common both to the Hebrews and the Romans; and yet I do not recollect that the latter have borrowed any of their poetical imagery from this occupation. It is proper, however, to remark, that this image was obvious and familiar to the Hebrews in a high degree, as we learn from what is said of the threshing-floor of Ornan 93 the Jebusite, which was situated in an open place (as were all the rest) in Jerusalem itself, and in the highest part of the city, in the very place, indeed, where the temple of Solomon was afterwards erected. Homer, who was uncommonly fond of every picture of rural life, esteemed that under our consideration so beautiful and significant, that, in a few instances  94 , he draws his comparisons from the threshing-floor (for even he was fearful of the boldness of this image in the form of a metaphor). Two of these comparisons he introduces to illustrate light subjects, contrary to the practice of the Hebrews; but the third is employed upon a subject truly magnificent, and this, as it approaches in some degree the sublimity of the Hebrew, it may not be improper to recite: "As with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er, "And thick bestrown, lies Ceres' sacred floor, "When round and round, with never-weary'd pain, "The trampling steers beat out th' unnumber'd grain: "So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls, "Tread down whole ranks, and crush our heroes souls  95 ." This comparison, however, though deservedly accounted one of the grandest and most beautiful which antiquity has transmitted to us, still falls greatly short of the Hebrew boldness and sublimity. A Hebrew writer would have compared the hero himself with the instrument, and not his horses with the oxen that are harnessed to it, which is rather too apposite, and too exactly similar  96 . But custom had not given equal licence to the Greek poetry; this image had not been equally familiar, had not occupied the same place as with the Hebrews; nor had acquired the same force and authority by long prescription. I ought not in this place to omit that supremely magnificent delineation of the divine vengeance, expressed by imagery taken from the Wine-press; and image which very frequently occurs in the sacred poets, but which no other poetry has presumed to introduce. But where shall we find expressions of equal dignity with the original in any modern language? By what art of the pencil can we exhibit even a shadow or an outline of that description, in which Isaiah depicts the Messiah as coming to vengeance  97 ? "Who is this that cometh from Edom? "With garments deeply dyed from Botsra? "This that is magnificent in his apparel; "Marching on in the greatness of his strength? "I who publish righteousness  98 , and am mighty to save. "Wherefore is thine apparel red? "And thy garments, as one that treadeth the wine-vat? "I have trodden the vat alone; "And of the peoples there was not a man with me. "And I trod them in mine anger; "And I trampled on them in mine indignation; "And their life-blood was sprinkled upon my garments; "And I have stained all my apparel." But the instances are innumerable which might be quoted of metaphors taken from the manners and customs of the Hebrews. One general remark, however, may be made upon this subject, namely, that from one simple, regular, and natural mode of life having prevailed among the Hebrews, it has arisen, that in their poetry these metaphors have less of obscurity, of meanness of depression, than could be expected, when we consider the antiquity of their writings, the distance of the scene, and the uncommon boldness and vivacity of their rhetoric. Indeed, to have made use of the boldest imagery with the most perfect perspicuity, and the most common and familiar with the greatest dignity, is a commendation almost peculiar to the sacred poets. I shall not hesitate to produce an example of this kind, in which the meanness of the image is fully equalled by the plainness and inelegance of the expression; and yet such is its consistency, such the propriety of its application, that I do not scruple to pronounce it sublime. The Almighty threatens the ultimate destruction of Jerusalem in these terms: "And I will wipe Jerusalem, "As a man wipeth a dish: "He wipeth it, and turneth it upside down  99 ." But many of these images must falsly appear mean and obscure to us, who differ so materially from the Hebrews in our manners and customs: but in such cases it is our duty neither too rashly to blame, nor too suddenly to despair. The mind should rather exert itself to discover, if possible, the connexion between the literal and the figurative meanings, which, in abstruse subjects, frequently depending upon some very delicate and nice relation, eludes our penetration. An obsolete custom, for instance, or some forgotten circumstance, opportunely adverted to, will sometimes restore its true perspicuity and credit to a very intricate passage. Whether the instance I have at present in view may prove of any utility or not in this respect, I will not presume to say; it may possibly, however, serve to illustrate still further the nature of the Hebrew imagery, and the accuracy of their poets in the application of it. Either through choice or necessity, the infernal regions and the state of the dead has been a very common topic with the poets of every nation; and this difficult subject, which the most vigorous understanding is unable to fathom by any exertion of reason, and of which conjecture itself can scarcely form any adequate idea, they have ornamented with all the splendour of description, as one of the most important themes which could engage the human imagination. Thus the prompt and fertile genius of the Greeks, naturally adapted to the fabulous  100 , has eagerly embraced the opportunity to indulge in all the wantonness of fiction, and has peopled the infernal regions with such a profusion of monsters, as could not fail to promote the ridicule even of the ignorant and the vulgar  101 . The conduct of the Hebrews has been very different; their fancy was restrained upon this subject by the tenets of their religion; and (notwithstanding the firm persuasion of the existence not only of the soul but of the body after death) we are to remember they were equally ignorant with the rest of mankind of the actual state and situation of the dead. In this case they have acted as in every other: what was plain and commonly understood concerning the dead, that is, what happened to the body suggested the general imagery to which the Hebrews always resort in describing the state and condition of departed souls, and in forming what may be termed, if the expression be allowable, their poetical Hell. It is called Sheol by the Hebrews themselves, by the Greeks Hades , and by the Latins Infernum , or Sepulchrum . Into the funeral rites or ceremonies of the Hebrews may be traced all the imagery which their poets introduce to illustrate this subject; and it must be confessed that these afforded ample scope for poetical embellishment. The sepulchres of the Hebrews, at least those of respectable persons, and those which hereditarily belonged to the principal families, were extensive caves, or vaults  102 , excavated from the native rock by art and manual labour. The roofs of them in general were arched; and some were so spacious as to be supported by colonades. All round the sides were cells for the reception of the Sarcophagi; these were properly ornamented with sculpture, and each was placed in its proper cell. The cave or sepulchre admitted no light, being closed by a great stone, which was rolled to the mouth of the narrow passage or entrance. Many of these receptacles are still extant in Judea: two in particular are more magnificent than all the rest  103 and are supposed to be the sepulchres of the kings. One of these is in Jerusalem, and contains twenty-four cells; the other, containing twice that number, is in a place without the city. If, therefore, we examine all those passages, in which the sacred writers have poetically described the infernal regions, we may, if I mistake not, clearly perceive them intent upon this gloomy picture, which their mode of sepulture presented to their view. That which struck their senses they delineated in their descriptions: we there find no exact account, no explicit mention of immortal spirits; not, according to the notion of some learned persons  104 , because they disbelieved in the existence of the soul after death, but because they had no clear idea or perception by which they might explain where or in what manner it existed; and they were not possessed of that subtilty of language, which enables men to speak with plausibility on subjects abstruse, and remote from the apprehension of the senses, and to cover their ignorance with learned disputation. The condition, the form, the habitation of departed spirits were therefore concealed from the Hebrews equally with the rest of mankind. Nor did revelation afford them the smallest assistance on this subject; not, perhaps, because the divine Providence was disposed to withhold this information from them, but because the present condition of the human mind renders it incapable of receiving it. For when the understanding contemplates things distinct from body and matter, from the want of just ideas, it is compelled to have recourse to such as are false and fictitious, and to delineate the incorporeal world by things corporeal and terrestrial. Thus, observing that after death the body returned to the earth, and that it was deposited in a sepulchre, after the manner which has just been described, a sort of popular notion prevailed among the Hebrews, as well as among other nations, that the life which succeeded the present was to be passed beneath the earth: and to this notion even the sacred prophets were obliged to allude occasionally, if they wished to be understood by the people on this subject. Hence the meaning is evident, when the deceased are said to "descend into the pit  105 , to the nether parts of the earth, to the gates and chambers of death, to the stony places, to the sides, to the gates of the caverns;" when it is said, "that the grave has swallowed them up, and closed its mouth upon them  106 ;" that "they lie down in the deep  107 ; immersed in a desert place, in the gulph, in thick darkness, in the land of darkness and the shadow of death, wild, hideous, where all is disorder and darkness: and darkness, as it were, instead of light diffuseth its beams 108 ." The poets of other nations, amidst all their fictions, have yet retained a congenial picture of the habitations of the dead: Thus the tragic poet has admirably described the deep course of Acheron: Thro' dreary caves cut in the rugged rock, Where reigns the darkness of perpetual hell  109 ." But how grand and magnificent a scene is depicted by the Hebrew poets from the same materials, in which their deceased heroes and kings are seen to advance from the earth! Figure to yourselves a vast, dreary, dark, sepulchral cavern 110 , where the kings of the nations lie, each upon his bed of dust  111 , the arms of each beside him, his sword under his head  112 , and the graves of their numerous hosts round about them  113 : Behold! the king of Babylon is introduced, they all rise and go forth to meet him; and receive him as he approaches! "Art thou also come down unto us? Art thou become like unto us? Art thou cut down and withered in thy strength, O thou destroyer of the nations!"---But I reluctantly refrain.---It is not for me, nor indeed for human ability, to explain these subjects with a becoming dignity. You will see this transcendent imagery, yourselves, better and more completely displayed in that triumphal song, which was composed by Isaiah  114 (the first of all poets for sublimity and elegance) previous to the death of the king of Babylon. Ezekiel  115 also has nobly illustrated the same scene, with similar machinery, in the last prophecy concerning the fall of Pharoah; that remarkable example of the terrific, which is indeed deservedly accounted the peculiar excellence of this Prophet. Imagery, which is borrowed from the rites and ceremonies of religion, peculiarly liable to obscurity and mistake---Instances of expressions, which appear uncommonly harsh; and of others, the principal elegance of which would be lost, unless we adverted to the nature of the sacred rites--- The exordium of the hundred and fourth Psalm explained . THE present disquisition concerning the poetical imagery of the Hebrews was undertaken, Gentlemen, principally with a view of guarding you against an error, which is apt to mislead those who peruse without sufficient attention and information writings of so old a date; namely, that of accounting vulgar, mean, or obscure, passages which were probably accounted among the most perspicuous and sublime by the people to whom they were addressed. Now, if with respect even to that imagery, which is borrowed from objects of nature, and of common life, (of which we have just been treating) such a caution was proper, it will surely be still more necessary with respect to that which is borrowed from the sacred mysteries of religion. For though much of that imagery which was taken by the Hebrew writers from the general face of nature, or from the customs of common life, was peculiar to their own country, yet much, it must be confessed, was equally familiar to the rest of the world; but that, which was suggested by the rites and ceremonies of religion, was altogether peculiar to themselves, and was but little known beyond the limits of Judea. Since, therefore, this topic in particular seems to involve many such difficulties and inconveniencies, it appears to me deserving of a serious investigation; and such investigation, I flatter myself, will tend to restore in some degree the real majesty of the Hebrew poetry, which seems to have shone forth in former times with no ordinary splendour. The religion of the Hebrews embraced a very extensive circle of divine and human economy. It not only included all that regarded the worship of God; it extended even to the regulation of the commonwealth, the ratification of the laws, the forms and administration of justice, and almost all the relations of civil and domestic life. With them almost every point of conduct was connected either directly or indirectly with their religion. Things which were held least in esteem by other nations, bore among them the sanction of divine authority, and had a very close alliance with both the more serious concerns of life and the sacred ceremonies. On these accounts it happens in the first place, that abundance of metaphors occur in the Hebrew poetry deduced from sacred subjects; and further, that there is a necessity for the most diligent observation, lest that very connexion with the affairs of religion should escape us. For should we be mistaken in so material a point; should we erroneously account as common or profane what is in its nature divine; or should we rank among the mean and the vulgar, sentiments and images which are sacred and sublime; it is incredible how much the strength of the language, and the force and majesty of the ideas, will be destroyed. Nothing in nature, indeed, can be so conducive to the sublime, as those conceptions which are suggested by the contemplation of the greatest of all beings; and when the august form of Religion presents itself to the mental eye, A servent pleasure, and an awe divine Seizes the soul, and lists it to its God. It follows therefore of course, that the dignity of the Hebrew poetry must in some measure be diminished in our eyes, since not only the connexion of the imagery with sacred things must frequently escape our observation, but even when it is most apparent, it can scarcely strike us with that force and vivacity with which it must have penetrated the minds of the Hebrews. The whole system of the Hebrew rites is one great and complicated allegory, to the study and observance of which all possible diligence and attention were incessantly dedicated by those who were employed in the sacred offices. On this occupation and study, therefore, all good and considerate men were intent; it constituted all their business, all their amusement; it was their treasure and their hope; on this every care and every thought was employed; and the utmost sanctity and reverence distinguished every part of their conduct which had any relation to it. Much dignity and sublimity must also have resulted from the recollection, which these allusions produced, of the splendour and magnificence of the sacred rites themselves; the force of which upon the minds of those who had frequent opportunities of observing them must have been incredible. Such a solemn grandeur attended these rites, especially after the building of Solomon's temple, that although we are possessed of very accurate descriptions, our imaginations are still utterly unable to embody them. Many allusions, therefore, of this kind, which the Hebrew poets found particularly energetic, and highly popular among their countrymen, may possibly appear to us mean and contemptible; since many things which were held by them in the highest veneration, are by us but little regarded, or perhaps but little understood. I shall subjoin a few examples of what I have just been remarking; or rather I shall point out a few topics, which will of themselves suggest a variety of examples. Much of the Jewish law is employed in discriminating between things clean and unclean; in removing, and making atonement for things polluted or prescribed: and under these ceremonies, as under a veil or covering, a meaning the most important and sacred is concealed, as would be apparent from the nature of them, even if we had not besides, other clear and explicit authority for this opinion. Among the rest are certain diseases and infirmities of the body, and some customs evidently in themselves indifferent: these, on a cursory view, seem light and trivial; but when the reasons of them are properly explored, they are found to be of considerable importance. We are not to wonder, therefore, if the sacred poets sometimes have recourse to these topics for imagery, even on the most momentous occasions, when they display the general depravity inherent in the human mind  116 , or exprobrate the corrupt manners of their own people  117 , or when they deplore the abject state of the virgin, the daughter of Sion, polluted and exposed  118 . If we consider these metaphors without any reference to the religion of their authors, they will doubtless appear in some degree disgusting and inelegant; if we refer them to their genuine source, to the peculiar rites of the Hebrews, they will be found wanting neither in force nor in dignity. Of the same nature, or at least analogous to them, are those ardent expressions of grief and misery, which are poured forth by the royal prophet (who, indeed, in many of those divine compositions personates a character far more exalted than his own); especially when he complains, that he is wasted and consumed with the loathsomeness of disease, and bowed down and depressed with a burden of sin too heavy for human nature to sustain  119 . On reading these passages, some, who were but little acquainted with the genius of the Hebrew poetry, have pretended to inquire into the nature of the disease with which the poet was affected; not less absurdly, in my opinion, than if they had perplexed themselves to discover in what river he was plunged, when he complains that "the deep waters had gone over his soul." But as there are many passages in the Hebrew poets, which may seem to require a similar defence, so there are in all probability many, which, although they now appear to abound in beauties and elegancies, would yet be thought much more sublime, were they illustrated from those sacred rites to which they allude; and, as excellent pictures, viewed in their proper light. To this purpose many instances might be produced from one topic, namely, from the precious and magnificent ornaments of the priest's attire. Such was the gracefulness, such the magnificence of the sacerdotal vestments, especially those of the high-priest; so adapted were they, as Moses says  120 , to the expression of glory and of beauty, that to those, who were impressed with an equal opinion of the sanctity of the wearer, nothing could possibly appear more venerable and sublime. To these, therefore, we find frequent allusions in the Hebrew poets, when they have occasion to describe extraordinary beauty or comeliness, or to delineate the perfect form of supreme Majesty. The elegant Isaiah  121 has a most beautiful idea of this kind, when he describes in his own peculiar manner (that is, most magnificently) the exultation and glory of the Church, after its triumphal restoration. Pursuing the allusion, he decorates her with the vestments of salvation, and clothes her in the robe of righteousness. He afterwards compares the Church to a bridegroom dressed for the marriage, to which comparison incredible dignity is added by the word Ikohen , a metaphor plainly taken from the apparel of the priests, the force of which, therefore, no modern language can express. No imagery, indeed, which the Hebrew writers could employ, was equally adapted with this to the display (as far as the human powers can conceive or depict the subject) of the infinite majesty of God. " Jehovah " is therefore introduced by the Psalmist, as "clothed with glory and with strength  122 ," he is "girded with power  123 ;" which are the very terms appropriated to the describing of the dress and ornaments of the priests. Thus far may appear plain and indisputable; but, if I mistake not, there are other passages, the beauty of which lies still more remote from common observation. In that most perfect ode, which celebrates the immensity of the Omnipresent Deity, and the wisdom of the divine Artificer in forming the human body, the author uses a metaphor derived from the most subtile art of the Phrygian workman: "When I was formed in the secret place, " When I was wrought with a needle in the depths of the earth  124 ." Whoever observes this, (in truth he will not be able to observe it in the common translations) and at the same time reflects upon the wonderful mechanism of the human body, the various implications of the veins, arteries, fibres, and membranes; the "undescribable texture" of the whole fabric; may, indeed, feel the beauty and gracefulness of this well-adapted metaphor, but will miss much of its force and sublimity, unless he be apprized that the art of designing in needlework was wholly dedicated to the use of the sanctuary, and, by a direct precept of the divine law, chiefly employed in furnishing a part of the sacerdotal habit  125 , and the veils for the entrance of the tabernacle. Thus, the poet compares the wisdom of the divine Artificer with the most estimable of human arts, that art which was dignified by being consecrated altogether to the use of religion; and the workmanship of which was so exquisite, that even the sacred writings seem to attribute it to a supernatural guidance 126 . I will instance also another topic, which, if I am not deceived, will suggest several remarkable examples to this purpose. There is one of the Hebrew poems, which has been long since distinguished by universal approbation; the subject is the wisdom and design of the Creator in the formation of the universe: you will easily perceive that I have in view the hundred and fourth Psalm. The exordium is most sublime, and consists of a delineation of the divine Majesty and power, as exemplified in the admirable constitution of nature. On this subject, since it is absolutely necessary to employ figurative language, the poet has introduced such metaphors as were accounted by the Hebrews the most magnificent and most worthy; for all of them are, in my opinion, borrowed from the Tabernacle: but I find it will be necessary to quote the passage itself, and I shall endeavour to explain it as briefly as possible. The poet first expresses his sense of the greatness and power of the Deity in plain and familiar language; and then breaks out in metaphor: "Thou art invested with majesty and glory:" Where observe the word labash (to invest ) is the word always used to express the ceremony of putting on the sacerdotal ornaments. "Covering thyself with light as with a garment:" The Light in the Holy of Holies, the manifest symbol of the divine Presence, is figured under this idea  127 ; and this singular example is made use of figuratively to express the universal and ineffable glory of God. "Stretching out the heavens as a curtain:" Jeringnab is the word made use of, and is the very name of those curtains, with which the Tabernacle was covered at the top and round about  128 . The Seventy seem to have had this in view, when they render it ![](/images/inline/rbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/slungr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  (as a skin)  129 : whence the Vulgate sicut pellem (which is a literal translation of the Septuagint); and another of the old translators ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  (a hide or skin). "Laying the beams of his chambers in the "waters:" In these words the poet admirably expresses the nature of the air, which, from various and floating elements, is formed into one regular and uniform mass, by a metaphor drawn from the singular construction of the Tabernacle: for it consisted of many different parts, which might be easily separated, but which were united by a curious and artful junction and adaptation to each other  130 . He proceeds: "Making the clouds his chariot; "Walking upon the wings of the wind:" He had before exhibited the divine Majesty under the appearance which it assumed in the Holy of Holies, that of a bright and dazzling light: he now describes it according to that which it assumed, when God accompanied the ark in the pillar of a cloud, which was carried along through the atmosphere. That vehicle of the divine Presence is, indeed, distinguished in the sacred history by the particular appellation of a chariot 131 . "Making the winds his messengers, "And his ministers a flaming fire:" The elements are described as prompt and ready in executing the commands of the Hebrew word being exactly expressive of the latter sense. "Who founded the earth upon its bases:" The following phrase also is directly taken from the same: "That it should not be displaced for more than ages:" That is, "for a certain period known only to the infinite wisdom of God." As the situation of both was in this respect nearly the same, so, on the other hand, the permanence of the sanctuary is in other places compared, and in almost the same words, with the stability of the earth  132 . Perhaps, in pursuing this investigation with so much subtilty and minuteness, I have scarcely acted consistently with the customs of this place, or the nature of my design: but it appeared absolutely necessary so to do, in order to make myself perfectly understood; and to demonstrate, that it is scarcely, or not at all, possible for any translation fully to represent the genuine sense of the sacred poets, and that delicate connexion which for the most part exists between their poetical imagery, and the peculiar circumstances of their nation  133 . This connexion frequently depends upon the use of certain terms, upon a certain association between words and things, which a translation generally perplexes, and very frequently destroys. This, therefore, is not to be preserved in the most literal and accurate version, much less in any poetical translation, or rather imitation: though there are extant some not unsuccessful attempts of this kind. To relish completely all the excellencies of the Hebrew literature, the fountains themselves must be approached, the peculiar flavour of which cannot be conveyed by aqueducts, or indeed by any exertion of modern art. The imagery from the sacred history is the most luminous and evident of all ---The peculiar nature of this kind of metaphor explained, as used by the Hebrew poets---The order of the topics which commonly furnish them: the Chaos and Creation; the Deluge; the Destruction of Sodom; the emigration of the Israelites from Egypt; the descent of God upon Mount Sinah---This species of metaphor excellently adapted to the sacred poetry, and particularly to the prophetic; not easy to form any comparison between the sacred and profane poetry in this respect . FOUR distinct classes of imagery having been specified as capable of being introduced in a metaphorical form into the poetry of the Hebrews, the last of these, or that which is suggested by the more remarkable transactions recorded in the sacred history, now remains to be examined. Here, however, since the nature of the subject differs in some degree from the former objects of our investigation, so the manner of treating it must be also different. The principal design of our late disquisition was, by considering the circumstances, customs, opinions, and sentiments of the Hebrews, to facilitate our approach to the interiour beauties of their poetry; and, by duly examining the nature of the circumstances, to estimate more properly the force and power of each; to dispel as much as possible the mists of antiquity; to restore their native perspicuity to such passages as appear obscure, their native agreeableness to such as now inspire us with sentiments of disgust, their proper allurement and elegance to those which seem harsh and vulgar, and their original dignity to those which the changeableness of custom has rendered contemptible or mean. In this division of our subject, on the contrary, but little will occur either difficult or obscure; nothing which will seem to require explication or defence: all will be at once perspicuous, splendid, and sublime. Sacred history illuminates this class of imagery with its proper light, and renders it scarcely less conspicuous to us than to the Hebrews themselves. There is, indeed, this difference, that to the Hebrews the objects of these allusions were all national and domestic; and the power of them in moving or delighting the mind was of course proportionably greater; nay, frequently, the very place, the scene of action, certain traces, and express tokens of so many miracles lying before their eyes, must have increased the effect. To us, on the other hand, however we may hold these facts in veneration, however great and striking they may be in themselves, the distance of time and place must of necessity render them less interesting. The manner in which these metaphors are formed is well deserving of observation, and is in fact as follows. In describing or embellishing illustrious actions, or future events of a miraculous nature, the Hebrew poets are accustomed to introduce allusions to the actions of former times, such as possess a conspicuous place in their history; and thus they illuminate with colours, foreign, indeed, but similar, the future by the past, the recent by the antique, facts less known by others more generally understood: and as this property seems peculiar to the poetry of the Hebrews, at least is but seldom to be met with in that of other nations, I have determined to illustrate this part of my subject with a greater variety of examples than usual. I mean, therefore, to instance in a regular order certain topics or common-places of Scripture, which seem to have furnished, if not all, at least the principal part of these allusions: it will be necessary at the same time to remark their figurative power and effect, and the regular and uniform method pursued in the application of them, which has been already stated as characteristical of the poetical imagery of the Hebrews. The first of these topics, or common-places, is the Chaos and the Creation, which compose the first pages of the sacred history. These are constantly alluded to, as expressive of any remarkable change, whether prosperous or adverse, in the public affairs; of the overthrow or restoration of kingdoms and nations: and are consequently very common in the prophetic poetry, particularly when any unusual degree of boldness is attempted. If the subject be the destruction of the Jewish empire by the Chaldeans, or a strong denunciation of ruin against the enemies of Israel, it is depicted in exactly the same colours, as if universal nature were about to relapse into the primeval chaos. Thus Jeremiah, in that sublime, and indeed more than poetical vision, in which is represented the impending desolation of Judea: "I beheld the earth, and lo! disorder and confusion; "The heavens also, and there was no light. "I beheld the mountains, and lo! they trembled; "And all the hills shook. "I beheld, and lo! there was not a man; "And all the fowls of the heavens were fled. "I beheld, and lo! the fruitful field (was become) the desert; "And all its cities were thrown down, "Before the presence of Jehovah , "Before the fierce heat of his anger  134 ." And on a similar subject Isaiah expresses himself with wonderful force and sublimity: "And he shall stretch over her the line of devastation, "And the plummet of emptiness  135 ." Each of them not only had in his mind the Mosaic chaos, but actually uses the words of the divine historian. The same subjects are amplified and embellished by the prophets with several adjuncts: "The sun and the moon are darkened, "And the stars withdraw their shining. " Jehovah also will thunder from Sion, "And from Jerusalem will he utter his voice; "And the heavens and the earth shall shake  136 ." "And all the host of heaven shall waste away: "And the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll; "And all their host shall wither; "As the withered leaf falleth from the vine, "And as the blighted fig from the fig-tree  137 ." On the contrary, when he foretels the restoration of the Israelites: "For I am Jehovah thy God; "He who stilleth at once the sea, "Though the waves thereof roar; " Jehovah God of Hosts is his name. "I have put my words in thy mouth; "And with the shadow of my hand have I covered thee: "To stretch out the heavens, and to lay the foundations of the earth; "And to say unto Sion, Thou art my people  138 ." "Thus therefore shall Jehovah console Sion; "He shall console her desolations: "And he shall make her wilderness like Eden; "And her desert like the garden of Jehovah : "Joy and gladness shall be found in her; "Thanksgiving, and the voice of melody  139 ." In the former of these two last-quoted examples the universal deluge is exactly delineated, and on similar subjects the same imagery generally occurs. Thus, as the devastation of the Holy Land is frequently represented by the restoration of ancient Chaos, so the same event is sometimes expressed in metaphors suggested by the universal deluge: "Behold, Jehovah emptieth the land, and maketh it waste; "He even turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants. "For the flood-gates from on high are opened; "And the foundations of the earth tremble. "The land is grievously shaken; "The land is utterly shattered to pieces; "The land is violently moved out of her place; "The land reeleth to and fro like a drunkard; "And moveth this way and that, like a lodge for a night  140 ." These are great ideas; indeed the human mind cannot easily conceive any thing greater or more sublime. There is nothing, however, of this kind more forcible and elevated than that imagery which is taken from the destruction of Sodom, that being the next in order of these topics, and generally applied to express the punishments to be inflicted by the Almighty on the wicked: "He shall rain live coals upon the ungodly, "Fire and Sulphur, and a burning storm  141 : this shall be the contents of their cup  142 ." "For it is the day of vengeance to Jehovah ; "The year of recompence to the defender of the cause of Sion. "And her torrents shall be turned into pitch, "And her dust into sulphur; "And her whole land shall become burning pitch: "By night or by day it shall not be extinguished; "For ever shall her smoke ascend: "From generation to generation she shall lie desert; "To everlasting ages no one shall pass through her  143 ." The emigration of the Israelites from Egypt, as it affords materials for many magnificent descriptions, is commonly applied in a metaphorical manner to many events, which bear no unapt resemblance to it. Does God promise to his people liberty, assistance, security, and favour? The Exodus occurs spontaneously to the mind of the poet; the dividing of the sea, the destruction of the enemy, the desert which was safely traversed, and the torrents bursting forth from the rocks, are so many splendid objects that force themselves on his imagination: "Thus faith Jehovah ; "Who made a way in the sea; "And a path in the mighty waters: "Who brought forth the rider and the horse, the army and the warrior; "Together they lay down, they rose no more; "They were extinguished, they were quenched like tow: "Remember not the former things; "And the things of ancient times regard not; "Behold, I make a new thing; "Even now shall it spring forth; will ye not regard it? "Yea, I will make in the wilderness a way; "In the desert streams of water  144 ." There is also another prophecy of the same divine poet, which in one sense (though I think not the principal) is to be understood as relating to the liberation of the Israelites from the Babylonish captivity. In the exordium the same imagery is introduced, but in a very noble personification, than which nothing can be more sublime: "Awake, awake, cloath thyself with strength, O arm of Jehovah ! "Awake as in the days of old, the ancient generations. "Art thou not the same, that smote Rahab, that wounded the dragon? "Art thou not the same, that dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep? "That made the depths of the sea a path for the redeemed to pass through  145 ." Of the same kind is the last of these topics which I shall instance, the descent of Jehovah at the delivery of the Law. When the Almighty is described as coming to execute judgment, to deliver the pious, and to destroy his enemies, or in any manner exerting his divine power upon earth, the description is embellished from that tremendous scene which was exhibited upon Mount Sinah  146 : there is no imagery more frequently recurred to than this, and there is none more sublime: I will only trouble you with two examples: "For, behold, Jehovah will go forth from his place; "And he will come down, and will tread on the high places of the earth. "And the mountains shall be molten under him: "And the vallies shall cleave asunder; "As wax before the fire, "As waters poured down a steep place  147 ." "The earth shook and was alarmed, "And the foundations of the hills rocked with terror, "For the wrath of Jehovah was hot against them. "Before his face a smoke ascended, "And a flame consumed before his presence, "Burning fires were kindled by it. "He bowed the heavens and came down, "And clouds of darkness were beneath his feet. "He rode upon the pinions of the Cherubim, "And flew on the wings of the wind. "He concealed himself in a veil of darkness; "A pavilion encompassed him "Of black water, and thick clouds of aether  148 . "From the brightness before him thick clouds past along, "Hailstones and burning fires. " Jehovah thundered in the heavens; "And the most high God sent forth his voice; "He shot out his arrows and dispersed the enemies, "And he multiplied his thunder and confounded them  149 ." These examples, though literally translated, and destitute of the harmony of verse, will I think sufficiently demonstrate the force, the grandeur and sublimity of these images, which, when applied to other events, suggest ideas still greater, than when described as plain facts by the pen of the historian, in however magnificent terms: for to the greatness and sublimity of the images which are alluded to, is added the pleasure and admiration which results from the comparison between them and the objects which they are brought to illustrate. It is, however, worthy of observation, that, since many of these images possess such a degree of resemblance as renders them equally fit for the illustration of the same objects, it frequently happens that several of them are collected together, in order to magnify and embellish some particular event: of this there is an example in that very thanksgiving ode of David, which we have just now quoted  150 . For, after describing the wrath and majesty of God, in imagery taken from the descent upon Mount Sinai, as already explained, in the very next verse, the division of the Red-sea and the River Jordan is alluded to: "Then appeared the channels of the waters; "The foundations of the world were discovered; "At thy reproofs, O Jehovah ! "At the breathing of the spirit of thine anger  151 ." It is evident, however, as well from the examples which have been adduced, as from the nature of the thing itself, that this species of metaphor is peculiarly adapted to the prophetic poetry. For some degree of obscurity is the necessary attendant upon prophecy; not that, indeed, which confuses the diction, and darkens the style; but that which results from the necessity of repressing a part of the future, and from the impropriety of making a complete revelation of every circumstance connected with the prediction. The event itself, therefore, is often clearly indicated, but the manner and the circumstances are generally involed in obscurity. To this purpose imagery such as we have specified is excellently adapted, for it enables the prophet more forcibly to impress upon the minds of his auditors those parts of his subject which admit of amplification, the force, the splendour, the magnitude of every incident; and at the same time more completely to conceal, what are proper to be concealed, the order, the mode, and the minuter circumstances attending the event. It is also no less apparent, that in this respect the sacred poetry bears little or no analogy to that of other nations; since neither history nor fable afforded to the profane writers a sufficiently important store of this kind of imagery; nor did their subjects in general require that use or application of it. This species of metaphor is indeed so adapted, as I before observed, to the nature of prophecy, that even profane poetry, when of the prophetic kind, is not altogether destitute of it: and we find that Virgil himself, in delivering his prophecies, has more than once adopted this method: "Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there; "A new Achilles shall in arms appear; "And he too goddess-born.--- "Another Tiphys shall new seas explore, "Another Argos brave the Iberian shore, "Another Helen other wars create, "And great Achilles urge the Trojan fate  152 :" Though some will perhaps be inclined to interpret this passage literally from the completion of the Great year , and the doctrine of the general restitution of all things  153 . There is, indeed, this difference between the sacred and profane writers, that among the latter we find frequent examples of meataphors taken from some remarkable person and event, applied to some other event or character  154 ; but we never find from such facts a general or common image derived, which, as an established mode of expression, is regularly applied to the illustration of similar objects, even to the designation of a universal or unlimited idea. I have classed all these examples under one general head of Metaphor, though many of them might more properly be referred to that of Allegory: but this circumstance is of no importance to the object which I was desirous of elucidating. Many, indeed, of those which I have produced on this last occasion, might more properly be referred to that sublimer kind of allegory, which in its principal view looks forward to a meaning much more important than that which is obvious and literal; and under the ostensible subject, as under a rind or shell, conceals one interiour and more sacred. Of this, however, we shall presently have occasion to speak more explicitly; for when we come to treat of the Allegory of the Hebrews, it will be necessary to touch upon that species (however difficult and obscure the subject) in which the sublimity of many of the sacred poems will be found chiefly to consist  155 . Three forms of Allegory: 1. Continued Metaphor; which is scarcely worth distinguishing from the simple Metaphor--- The freedom of the Hebrews in confounding the forms of the Metaphor, Allegory, and Comparison: a more perfect form also of Allegory instanced---2. The Parable; and its principal characteristics: that it ought to be formed from an apt and well-known image, the signification of which is obvious and definite; also from one which is elegant and beautiful; that its parts and adjuncts be perspicuous, and conduce to the main object; that it be consistent, and must not confound the literal and figurative meaning---The Parables of the Prophets, and particularly of Ezekiel, examined according to this standard . ANOTHER branch of the Mashal , or figurative style, is Allegroy, that is, a figure which, under the literal sense of the words, conceals a foreign or distant meaning  156 . Three forms of Allegory may be observed in the sacred poetry. The first is that which is commonly treated of by Rhetoricians, a continuation of metaphor. "When several kindred metaphors succeed one another, they alter," says Cicero, the form of a composition; for which reason a succession of this kind is called by the Greeks an Allegory ; and properly, in respect to the etymology of the word; but Aristotle, instead of considering it as a new species of figure, has more judiciously comprized such modes of expression under the general appellation of Metaphors  157 ." I therefore scarcely esteem it worth while to dwell upon this species of allegory; since hitherto I hae made no distinction between it and the simple metaphor: for many of the examples, which I produced as metaphors, are probably of this class: the principle of each is the same, nor indeed would it be an easy matter to restrict each to its proper limits, or to define where the one ends or the other begins. It will not, however, be foreign to our purpose to remark the peculiar manner, in which the Hebrew poets use the congenial figures, Metaphor, Allegory, and Comparison, and particularly in the prophetic poetry. When they undertake to express any sentiment in ornamented language, they not only illustrate it with an abundance and variety of imagery, but they seldom temper or regulate this imagery by any fixed principle or standard. Unsatisfied with a simple metaphor, they frequently run it into an allegory, or mingle with it a direct comparison. The allegory sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the simile; to this is added a frequent change of imagery, and even of persons and tenses; through the whole displaying a degree of boldness and freedom, unconfined by rule or method, altogether peculiar to the Hebrew poetry. "Judah is a lion's whelp  158 :" This metaphor is immediately drawn out into an allegory, with a change of person: "From the prey, my son, thou art gone up;" (to the dens in the mountains understood:) In the succeeding sentences the person is again changed, the image is gradually advanced, and the metaphor is joined with a comparison, which is repeated: "He stoopeth down, he coucheth, as a lion; "And as a lioness; who shall rouse him?" Of a similar nature is that remarkable prophecy, in which the exuberant increase of the Gospel on its first dissemination is most explicitly foretold. In this passage, however, the mixture of the metaphor and comparison, as well as the ellipsis of the word to be repeated, creates a degree of obscurity: "Beyond the womb of the morning is the dew of thy offspring to thee  159 :" That is, "preferable to the dew which proceeds from the womb of the morning; more copious, more abundant  160 ." In the interpretation of this passage, what monstrous blunders has an ignorance of the Hebrew idiom produced! There is, indeed, a certain form, which this kind of allegory sometimes assumes, more perfect and regular, which therefore ought not to be overlooked, and that is, when it occupies the whole compass and argument of the composition. An excellent example of this may be seen in that well-known allegory of Solomon  161 in which old age is so admirably depicted. The inconveniencies of increasing years, the debility of mind and body, the torpor of the senses, are expressed, most learnedly and elegantly indeed, but with some degree of obscurity, by different images derived from nature and common life: for by this enigmatical composition, Solomon, after the manner of the Oriental sages, meant to put to trial the acuteness of his readers. It has on this account afforded much exercise to the ingenuity of the learned, many of whom have differently, it is true, but with much learning and sagacity, explined the passage. There is also in Isaiah an allegory, which, with no less elegance of imagery, is more simple and regular, more just and complete in the form and colouring: I shall, therefore, quote the whole passage  162 The Prophet is explaining the design and manner of the divine judgments: he is inculcating the principle, that God adopts different modes of acting in the chastisement of the wicked, but that the most perfect wisdom is conspicuous in all; that "he will," as he had urged before, "exact judgment by the line, and righteousness by the plummet  163 ;" that he ponders with the most minute attention the distinctions of times, characters, and circumstances; all the motives to lenity or severity. All this is expressed in a continued allegory, the imagery of which is taken from agriculture and threshing: the use and suitableness of which imagery, as in a manner consecrated to this subject, I have formerly explained, so that there is no need of further detail at present. "Listen ye and hear my voice; "Attend and hearken unto my words. "Doth the husbandman plow every day that he may sow, "Opening, and breaking the clods of his field? "When he hath made even the face thereof; "Doth he not then scatter the dill, and cast abroad the cummin; "And sow the wheat in due measure; "And the barley, and the rye, hath its appointed limit? "For his God rightly instructeth him; he furnisheth him with knowledge. "The dill is not beaten out with the corn-drag; "Nor is the wheel of the wain made to turn upon the cummin: "But the dill is beaten out with the staff; "And the cummin with the flail: but the bread-corn  164 with the threshing-wain "But not for ever will he continue thus to thresh it; "Nor to vex it with the wheel of his wain; "Nor to bruise it with the hoofs of his cattle. "This also proceedeth from Jehovah God of hosts: "He sheweth himself wonderful in counsel, great in operation  165 ." Another kind of allegory is that, which, in the proper and restricted sense, may be called Parable, and consists of a continued narration of a fictitious event, applied by way of simile to the illustration of some important truth. The Greeks call these allegories ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  (or apologues ), the Latins fabul ae (or fables): and the writings of the Phrygian sage, or those composed in imitation of him, have acquired the greatest clebrity. Nor has our Saviour himself disdained to adopt the same method of instruction, of whose parables it is doubtful, whether they excel most in wisdom and utility, or in sweetness, elegance, and perspicuity. I must observe, that the appellation of Parable having been applied to his discourses of this kind, the term is now restricted from its former extensive signification to a more confined sense. This species of composition occurs very frequently in the prophetic poetry, and particularly in that of Ezekiel. But to enable us to judge with more certainty upon the subject, it will be necessary to explain in a few words some of the primary qualities of the poetic parables, that, by considering the general nature of them, we may decide more accurately on the merits of particular examples. It is the first excellence of a parable to turn upon an image well known and applicable to the subject, the meaning of which is clear and definite; for this circumstance will give it perspicuity, which is essential to every species of allegory. If, therefore, by this rule we examine the parables of the sacred Prophets, we shall, I am persuaded, find them not in the least deficient. They are in general founded upon such imagery as is frequently used, and similarly applied by way of metaphor and comparison in the Hebrew poetry. Most accurate examples of this are to be found in the parable of the deceitful vineyard  166 , of the useless vine  167 , which is given to the fire; for under this imagery the ungrateful people of God are more than once described. I may instance also that of the lion's whelps falling into the pit  168 , in which is appositely displayed the captivity of the Jewish princes; or that of the fair, lofty, and flourishing cedar of Lebanon  169 , which raised its head to the clouds, cut down at length and neglected; exhibiting, as in a picture, the prosperity and the fall of the king of Assyria. I will add one more example (there is, indeed, scarcely any which might not with propriety be introduced here) I mean that, in which the love of God towards his people, and their piety and fidelity to him, are expressed by an allusion to the solemn covenant of marriage. Ezekiel has pursued this image with uncommon freedom in two parables  170 ; in truth almost all the sacred poets have touched upon it. There was, therefore, no part of the imagery of the Hebrew poetry more established than this; nor ought it to appear extraordianry, that Solomon, in that most elegant poem, the Canticles, should distinguish and depict the most sacred of all subjects with similar outlines, and in similar colours. It is not, however, sufficient, that the image be apt and familiar; it must also be elegant and beautiful in itself: since it is the purpose of a poetic parable, not only to explain more perfectly some proposition, but frequently to give it more animation and splendour. The imagery from natural objects is superior to all other in this respect; for almost every picture from nature, if accurately drawn, has its peculiar beauty. As the parables of the sacred poets, therefore, consist chiefly of this kind of imagery, the elegance of the materials generally serves to recommend them. If there be any of a different kind, such as may be accounted less delicate and refined, it ought to be considered, whether they are not to be accounted among those, the dignity and grace of which are lost to us, though they were perhaps wanting in neither to people of the same age and country. If any reader, for instance, should be offended with the boiling pot of Ezekiel 171 , and the scum flowing over into the fire; let him remember, that the prophet, who was also a priest, took the allusion from his own sacred rites: nor is there a possibility, that an image could be accounted mean or disgusting, which was connected with the holy ministration of the Temple. It is also essential to the elegance of a parable, that the imagery should not only be apt and beautiful, but that all its parts and appendages should be perspicuous and pertinent. It is, however, by no means necessary, that in every parable the allusion should be complete in every part; such a degree of resemblance would frequently appear too minute and exact: but when the nature of the subject will bear, much more when it will even require a fuller explanation; and when the similitude runs directly, naturally, and regularly, through every circumstance, then it cannot be doubted that it is productive of the greatest beauty. Of all these excellencies, there cannot be more perfect examples than the parables which have been just specified. I will also venture to recommend the well-known parable of Nathan  172 , although written in prose, as well as that of Jotham  173 , which appears to be the most ancient extant, and approaches somewhat nearer the poetical form  174 To these remarks I will add another, which may be considered as the criterion of a parable, namely, that it be consistent throughout, and that the literal be never confounded with the figurative sense. In this respect it materially differs from the former species of allegory, which, deviating but gradually from the simple metaphor, does not always immediately exclude literal expressions, or words without a figure  175 But both the fact itself, and this distinction, will more evidently appear from an example of each kind. The Psalmist, (whoever he was) describing the people of Israel as a vine  176 , has continued the metaphor, and happily drawn it out through a variety of additional circumstances. Among the many beauties of this allegory, not the least graceful is that modesty, with which he enters upon and concludes his subject, making an easy and gradual transition from plain to figurative language, and no less delicately receding back to the plain and unornamented narrative. "Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; "Thou hast cast out the nations and planted it, "Thou preparedst room before it"--- After this follow some figurative expressions, less cautiously introduced: in which when he has indulged for some time, how elegantly does he revert to his proper subject! "Return, O God of Hosts! "Look down from heaven, and behold, "And visit this vine: "And the branch which thy right hand hath planted; "And the offspring  177 which thou madest strong for thyself. "It is burned in the fire, it is cut away; "By the rebuke of thy countenance they perish. "Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand  178 ; "Upon the son of man, whom thou madest strong for thyself." You may easily perceive, Gentlemen, how, in this first kind of allegory, the literal may be mingled with the figurative sense; and even how graceful this practice appears, since light is more agreeably thrown upon the subject in an oblique manner, without too bare and direct an explication. But it is different, when the same image puts on the form of the other sort of allegory, or parable, as in Isaiah  179 . Here is no room for literal, or even ambiguous expressions; every word is figurative; the whole mass of colouring is taken from the same pallet. Thus what, in the former quotation, is expressed in undisguised language, namely, "the casting out of the nations, the preparation of the place, and its destruction from the rebuke of the Lord," is by Isaiah expressed wholly in a figurative manner:---"The Lord gathered out the stones from his vineyard, and cleared it: but when it deceived him, he threw down its hedge, and made it waste, and commanded the clouds that they should rain no rain upon it." Expressions, which in the one case possess a peculiar grace, would be absurd and incongruous in the other. For the continued metaphor and the parable have a very different aim. The sole intention of the former is to embellish a subject, to represent it more magnificently, or at the most to illustrate it; that, by describing it in more elevated language, it may strike the mind more forcibly: but the intent of the latter is to withdraw the truth for a moment from our sight, in order to conceal whatever it may contain ungraceful or disgusting, and to enable it secretly to insinuate itself, and obtain an ascendancy as it were by stealth. There is, however, a species of parable, the intent of which is only to illustrate the subject: such is that remarkable one of Ezekiel  180 , which I just now commended, of the cedar of Lebanon: than which, if we consider the imagery itself, none was ever more apt or more beautiful; if the description and colouring, none was ever more elegant or splendid; in which, however, the poet has occasionally allowed himself to blend the figurative with the literal description  181 : whether he has done this because the peculiar nature of this kind of parable required it, or whether his own fervid imagination alone, which disdained the stricter rules of composition, was his guide, I can scarcely presume to determine. The definition of the Mystical Allegory---Founded upon the allegorical or typical nature of the Jewish religion---The distinction between this and the two former species of allegory; in the nature of the materials: it being allowable in the former to make use of imagery from indifferent object; in this, only such as is derived from things sacred, or their opposites; in the former, the exterior image has no foundation in truth; in the latter, both images are equally true---The difference in the form or manner of treating them---The most beautiful form is when the corresponding images run parallel through the whole poem, and mutually illustrate each other---Examples of this in the iid and lxxiid Psalms---The parabolic style admirably adapted to this species of allegory; the nature of which renders it the language most proper for prophecy---Extremely dark in itself, but it is gradually cleared up by the series of events foretold, and more complete revelation; time also, which in the general obscures, contributes to its full explanation . THE third species of Allegory, which also prevails much in the prophetic poetry, is when a double meaning is couched under the same words; or when the same production, according as it is differently interpreted, relates to different events, distant in time, and distinct in their nature. These different relations are termed the Literal and the Mystical senses; and these constitute one of the most difficult and important topics of Theology. The subject is, however, connected also with the sacred poetry, and is therefore deserving of a place in these Lectures. In the sacred rites of the Hebrews, things, places, times, offices, and such like, sustain as it were a double character, the one proper or literal, the other allegorical; and in their writings these subjects are sometimes treated of in such a manner, as to relate either to the one sense or the other singly, or to both united. For instance, a composition may treat of David, of Solomon, of Jerusalem, so as to be understood to relate simply either to the city itself and its monarchs, or else to those objects, which, in the sacred allegory of the Jewish religion, are denoted by that city and by those monarchs: or the mind of the author may embrace both objects at once, so that the very words which express the one in the plain, proper, historical, and commonly-received sense, may typify the other in the sacred, interior, and prophetic sense. From these principles of the Jewish religion, this kind of allegory, which I am inclined to call Mystical, seems more especially to derive its origin; and from these we must endeavour at an explanation of it. But its nature and peculiar properties will probably be more easily demonstrable, if we previously define, in what respects it is different from the two former species of allegory. The first remarkable difference is, that in allegories of the kind already noticed, the writer is at liberty to make use of whatever imagery is most agreeable to his fancy or inclination: there is nothing in universal nature, nothing which the mind perceives, either by sense or reflexion, which may not be adapted in the form of a continued metaphor, or even of a parable, to the illustration of some other subject. This latter kind of allegory, on the contrary, can only be supplied with proper materials from the sacred rites of the Hebrews themselves; nor can it be introduced, except in relation to such things as are directly connected with the Jewish religion, or their immediate opposites. For to Israel, Sion, Jerusalem, in the allegorical as well as the literal sense, are opposed Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Idumea; and the same opposition exists in other subjects of a similar nature. The two former kinds of allegory are of the same general nature with the other figures, and partake of the common privileges of poetry; this latter, or mystical allegory, has its foundation in the nature of the Jewish economy, and is adapted solely to the poetry of the Hebrews  182 Hence that truly Divine Spirit, which has not disdained to employ poetry as the interpreter of its sacred will, has also in a manner appropriated to its own use this kind of allegory, as peculiarly adapted to the publication of future events, and to the typifying of the most sacred mysteries: so that should it, on any occasion, be applied to a profane and common subject; being diverted from its proper end, and forced as it were from its natural bias, it would inevitably want all its power and elegance. There is likewise this further distinction, that in those other forms of allegory, the exterior or ostensible imagery is fiction only; the truth lies altogether in the interior or remote sense, which is veiled as it were under this thin and pellucid covering. But in the allegory, of which we are now treating, each idea is equally agreeable to truth. The exterior or ostensible image is not a shadowy colouring of the interior sense, but is in itself a reality; and although it sustain another character, it does not wholly lay aside its own. For instance, in the metaphor or parable, the Lion, the Eagle, the Cedar, considered with respect to their identical existence, are altogether destitute of reality; but what we read of David, Solomon, or Jerusalem, in this sublimer kind of allegory, may be either accepted in a literal sense, or may be mystically interpreted according to the religion of the Hebrews, and in each view, whether considered conjunctly or apart, will be found equally agreeable to truth. Thus far this kind of allegory differs from the former in the materials, or in the nature of the imagery which it employs; but there is some difference also in the form or manner of introducing this imagery. I had occasion before to remark the liberty, which is allowed in the continued metaphor, of mingling the literal with the figurative meaning, that is, the obvious with the remote idea; which is a liberty altogether inconsistent with the nature of a parable. But to establish any certain rules with regard to this point in the conduct of the mystical allegory, would be a difficult and hazardous undertaking. For the Holy Spirit has evidently chosen different modes of revealing his sacred counsels, according to the circumstances of persons and times, inciting and directing at pleasure the minds of his prophets  183 : at one time displaying with an unbounded liberality the clear indications of future events; at another imparting some obscure intimations with a sparing hand. Thus there is a vast variety in the use and conduct of the mystical allegory; in the modes in which the corresponding images are arranged, and in which they are obscured or eclipsed by one another. Sometimes the obvious or literal sense is so prominent and conspicuous, both in the words and sentiments, that the remote or figurative sense is scarcely permitted to glimmer through it  184 . On the other hand, and that more frequently, the figurative sense is found to beam forth with so much perspicuity and lustre, that the literal sense is quite cast into a shade, or becomes indiscernible. Sometimes the principal or figurative idea is exhibited to the attentive eye with a constant and equal light; and sometimes it unexpectedly glares upon us, and breaks forth with sudden and astonishing corruscations, like a flash of lightning bursting from the clouds. But the mode or form of this figure, which possesses the most beauty and elegance (and that elegance is the principal object of this disquisition) is, when the two images equally conspicuous run, as it were, parallel through the whole poem, mutually illustrating and correspondent to each other. Though the subject be obscure, I do not fear being able to produce one or two undoubted instances of this peculiar excellence, which, if I am not mistaken, will sufficiently explain what I have advanced concerning the nature of the mystical allegory. The subject of the second Psalm is the establishment of David upon the throne, agreeably to the Almighty decree, notwithstanding the fruitless opposition of his enemies. The character which David sustains in this poem is twofold, literal and allegorical. If on the first reading of the Psalm we consider the character of David in the literal sense, the composition appears sufficiently perspicuous, and abundantly illustrated by facts from the sacred history. Through the whole, indeed, there is an unusual fervour of language, a brilliancy of metaphor; and sometimes the diction is uncommonly elevated, as if to intimate, that something of a more sublime and important nature lay concealed within; and as if the poet had some intention of admitting us to the secret recesses of his subject. If, in consequence of this indication, we turn our minds to contemplate the internal sense, and apply the same passages to the allegorical David, a nobler series of events is presented to us, and a meaning not only more sublime, but even more perspicuous, rises to the view. Should any thing at first appear bolder and more elevated than the obvious sense would bear, it will now at once appear clear, expressive, and admirably adapted to the dignity of the principal subject. If, after having considered attentively the subjects apart, we examine them at length in a united view, the beauty and sublimity of this most elegant poem will be improved  185 We may then perceive the vast disparity of the two images, and yet the continual harmony and agreement that subsists between them, the amazing resemblance, as between near relations, in every feature and lineament, and the accurate analogy which is preserved, so that either may pass for the original, whence the other was copied. New light is reflected upon the diction, and a degree of dignity and importance is added to the sentiments, whilst they gradually rise from humble to more elevated objects, from human to divine, till at length the great subject of the poem is placed in the most conspicuous light, and the composition attains the highest point of sublimity. What has been remarked concerning this Psalm, may be applied with propriety to the seventy-second, which exactly resembles it both in matter and form. It might not improperly be entitled the Inauguration of Solomon. The nature of the allegory is the same with the former; the style is something different, on account of the disparity of the subject. In the one the pomp and splendour of victory is displayed; in the other the placid image of peace and felicity. The style of the latter is, therefore, more calm and temperate, more ornamented, more figurative; not abounding in the same boldness of personification as the former, but rather touched with the gay and cheerful colouring of nature, in its most flourishing and delightful state. From this example some light will be thrown upon the nature of the parabolic style; in particular it will appear admirably adapted to this kind of allegory, on account of its abounding so much in this species of imagery. For as the imagery of nature is equally calculated to express the ideas of divine and spiritual, or of human things, a certain analogy being preserved in each; so it easily admits that degree of ambiguity, which appears essential to this figure. By these means the composition is at the same time diversified and perspicuous, applicable to both senses, and obscure in neither; and completely comprehending both parts of the allegory, may clearly and distinctly be referred to either. Still, however, a degree of obscurity must occasionally attend this style of composition; and this obscurity not only results from the nature of the figure, but is even not without its peculiar utility. For the mystical allegory is on this very account so agreeable to the nature of prophecy, that it is the form which the latter generally, and I might add lawfully, assumes, as most fitted for the prediction of future events. It describes events in a manner exactly conformable to the intention of prophecy; that is, in a dark, disguised, and intricate manner; sketching out in a general way their form and outline; and seldom descending to minuteness of description, and exactness of detail. If on some occasions it expresly signifies any notable circumstance, it seems to be for two principal reasons  186 : First, that, as generally happens, by suddenly withdrawing from our view the literal meaning, the attention may be excited to the investigation of the figurative sense; and secondly, that certain express marks, or distinguishing features, may occasionally shew themselves, which, after the accomplishment of the prediction, may be sufficient to remove every doubt, and to assert and confirm, in all points, the truth and divinity of the prophecy 187 . The prophetic, indeed, differs in one respect from every other species of the sacred poetry: when first divulged it is impenetrably obscure  188 ; and time, which darkens every other composition, elucidates it. That obscurity, therefore, in which at first this part of the sacred writings was involved, is now in a great measure removed; there are now many things which the course of events (the most certain interpreter of prophecy) has completely laid open; from many the Holy Spirit has itself condescended to remove the veil, with which they were at first concealed; many sacred institutions there are, the reason and intent of which are more clearly understood, since the design of the Jewish dispensation has been more perfectly revealed. Thus it happens, that, instructed and supported by these aids, of which the ancient Hebrews were destitute, and which in truth appear not to have been conceded to the prophets themselves, we come better accomplished for the knowledge and comprehension of that part of the sacred poetry, which is the most singular in its nature, and by far the most difficult of explanation. Comparisons are introduced for three purposes; illustration, amplification, and variety \--- For the first an image is requisite, apt, well-known, and perspicuous; it is of little consequence whether it be sublime or beautiful, or neither: hence comparisons from objects which are in themselves mean and humble may be sometimes useful \--- For the purpose of amplification an image is requisite which is sublime, or beautiful, even though it should be less apt and perspicuous: and on this plea a degree of obscurity, or a remoteness in the resemblance, may sometimes be excused \--- When variety is the object, splendid, beautiful, and elegant imagery must be sought for; and which has an apt agreement with the object of the comparison in the circumstances or adjuncts, though the objects themselves may be different in kind \--- The most perfect comparison is that, in which all these excellencies are united \--- The peculiar form of comparisons in the Hebrew poetry; it results from the nature of the sententious style \--- They are short, frequent, simple, depending often on a single attribute \--- Different images displayed in the parallel sentences; many comparisons are arranged in this manner to illustrate the same subject; or different attributes of the same comparison are often distributed in the different divisions or parallelisms . which I have classed the third in order of the poetical figures, with a view of illustrating in some degree both its general properties, and its peculiar application and force in the poetic compositions of the Hebrews. Comparisons serve three distinct purposes, namely, illustration, amplification, and pleasure or variety  189 . In the first place, comparisons are introduced to illustrate a subject, and to place it in a clearer and more conspicuous point of view. This is most successfully effected, when the object which furnishes the simile is familiar and perspicuous, and when it exactly agrees with that to which it is compared. In this species of comparison elevation or beauty, sublimity or splendour, are of little consequence; strict propriety, and a direct resemblance, calculated exactly for the explanation of the subject, is a sufficient commendation. Thus Homer very accurately depicts the numbers of the Grecian army, their ardour and eagerness for battle, by a comparison taken from flies collected about a milk-pail  190 ; and Virgil compares the diligence of the Tyrians in building their city, and the variety of their occupations, with the labours of the bees  191 ; without in the least degrading the dignity of the Epic Muse. I might produce many examples to the purpose from the sacred poetry, but shall content myself with two or three, than which, both as to matter and expression, nothing can be meaner or more vulgar, nothing, however, can be conceived more forcible or expressive. Isaiah introduces the king of Assyria insolently boasting of his victories: "And my hand hath found, as a nest, the riches of the peoples: "And as one gathereth eggs deserted, "So have I made a general gathering of the earth: "And there was no one that moved the wing; "That opened the beak, or that chirped  192 ." And Nahum on a similar subject: "All thy strong-holds shall be like fig-trees with the first ripe figs: "If they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater  193 ." There is also another comparison of Isaiah taken from domestic life, very obvious and very common; but which for the gracefulness of the imagery, the elegance of the arrangement, and the forcible expression of the tenderest affections, has never been exceeded: "But Sion saith: Jehovah hath forsaken me; "And my Lord hath forgotten me. "Can a woman forget her sucking infant; "That she should have no tenderness for the son of her womb? "Even these may forget; "But I will not forget thee  194 There is another species of comparison, the principal intent of which is the amplification of the subject; and this is evidently of a different nature from the former: for, in the first place it is necessary, that the image which is introduced for the purpose of amplifying or enobling a subject be sublime, beautiful, magnificent, or splendid, and therefore not trite or common; nor is it by any means necessary that the resemblance be exact in every circumstance. Thus Virgil has the address to impart even to the labours of his bees a wonderful air of sublimity, by a comparison with the exertions of the Cyclops in fabricating the thunderbolts of Jupiter  195 : thus he admirably depicts the grace, the dignity and strength of his Æneas, by comparing him with Apollo on the top of Cynthus renewing the sacred chorus 196 ; or with the mountains Athos, Eryx, and Appenine  197 Thus also Homer  198 , in which he is imitated by Virgil  199 , comparses two heroes rushing to battle with Mars and his offspring Terror advancing from Thrace to the Phlegyans and Ephyrians. But if it should be objected, that as comparisons of the former kind are wanting in dignity, so these (in which familiar objects are compared with objects but little known, or with objects which have little agreement or resemblance to them) are more likely to obscure than to illustrate; let it be remembered, that each species of comparison has in view a different end. The aim of the poet in the one case is perspicuity, to enable the mind clearly to perceive the subject, and to comprehend the whole of it at one view; in the other the object is sublimity, or to impress the reader with the idea that the magnitude of the subject is scarcely to be conceived  200 When considered in this light, it will, I dare presume, be allowed, that none of these forms of comparison, when rightly applied, is deficient, either in propriety or elegance. The Hebrews have nothing that corresponds with those fables, to which the Greek and Roman poets have recourse, when amplification is required: nor can we be surprized that imagery so consecrated, so dignified by religion and antiquity, and yet of so obvious and established acception as to be intelligible to the meanest understanding, should supply abundant and suitable materials for this purpose. The sacred poets, therefore, resort in this case chiefly to the imagery of nature; and this they make use of, indeed, with so much elegance and freedom, that we have no cause to regret the want to those fictions, to which other nations have recourse. To express or delineate prosperity and opulence, a comparison is assumed from the cedar or the palm  201 ; if the form of majesty or external beauty is to be depicted, Lebanon or Carmel is presented to our view  202 Sometimes they are furnished with imagery from their religious rites, at once beautiful, dignified, and sacred. In both these modes, the Psalmist most elegantly extols the pleasures and advantages of fraternal concord: Sweet as the od'rous balsam pour'd On Aaron's sacred head; Which o'er his beard, and down his breast A breathing fragrance shed. As morning dew on Sion's mount Beams forth a silver ray; Or studs with gems the verdant pomp, That Hermon's tops display  203 Let us, however, attend for a moment to Isaiah, whom no writer has surpassed in propriety, when his aim is to illustrate; or in sublimity, when he means to amplify his subject: "Wo to the multitude of the numerous peoples, "Who make a sound like the found of the seas: "And to the roaring of the nations, "Who make a roaring like the roaring of mighty waters. "Like the roaring of mighty waters do the nations roar; "But he shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far away; "And they shall be driven like the chaff of the hills before the wind, "And like the gossamer before the whirlwind  204 ." The third species of Comparison seems to hold a middle rank between the two preceding: and the sole intent of it is, by a mixture of new and varied imagery with the principal matter, to prevent satiety or disgust, and to promote the entertainment of the reader. It neither descends to the humility of the one, nor emulates the sublimity of the other. It pursues rather the agreeable, the ornamental, the elegant, and ranges through all the variety, all the exuberance of nature. In so extensive a field it would be an infinite task to collect all that might be observed of each particular. I shall remark one circumstance only, which though it sometimes take place in the two former species of comparison, may be said notwithstanding to be chiefly appropriated to this last. There are two operations of the mind, evidently contrary to each other. The one consists in combining ideas, the other in separating and distinguishing them. For in contemplating the innumerable forms of things, one of the first reflexions which occurs is, that there are some which have an immediate agreement, and some which are directly contrary to each other. The mind, therefore, contemplates those objects which have a resemblance in their universal nature in such a manner, as naturally to inquire whether in any respect they so disagree, as to furnish any mark of discrimination; on the contrary, it investigates those which are generally different in such a manner, as to remark whether, in their circumstances or adjuncts, they may not possess something in common, which may serve as a bond of connexion or association to class or unite them. The final cause of the former of these operations seems to be---to caution and guard us against error, in confounding one with another; of the latter, to form a kind of repository of knowledge, which may be resorted to, as occasion serves, either for utility or pleasure. These constitute the two faculties, which are distinguished by the names of judgment and imagination  205 . As accuracy of judgment is demonstrated by discovering in things, which have in general a very strong resemblance, some partial disagreement; so the genius or fancy is entitled to the highest commendation, when in those objects, which upon the whole have the least agreement, some striking similarity is traced out  206 . In those comparisons, therefore, the chief purpose of which is ornament or pleasure, thus far may pass for an established principle, that they are most likely to accomplish this end, when the image is not only elegant and agreeable, but is also taken from an object, which in the general is materially different from the subject of comparison, and only aptly and pertinently agrees with it in one or two of its attributes. But I shall probably explain myself better by an example. There is in Virgil a comparison, borrowed from Homer, of a boiling caldron  207 . Supposing in each poet the versification and description equally elegant; still, as the relation between the things compared is different, so the grace and beauty of the comparison is different in the two poets. In Homer the waters of the river Xanthus boiling in their channel by the fire, which Vulcan has thrown into the river, are compared with the boiling of a heated caldron; but Virgil compares with the same object the mind of Turnus agitated by the torch of the fury Alecto. The one brings together ideas manifestly alike, or rather indeed the same, and only differing in circumstances; the other, on the contrary, assimilates objects, which are evidently very different in their nature, but aptly agreeing in some of their adjuncts or circumstances. Thus the comparison of the Latin poet is new, diversified, and agreeable; but that of the Greek, although not destitute of force in illustrating the subject, is undoubtedly wanting in all the graces of variety, ornament, and splendour. For the same reason, there is perhaps no comparison of any poet extant more ingenious, more elegant or perfect in its kind, than the following of the same excellent poet: "The hero floating in a flood of care, "Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare: "To different objects turns his anxious mind; "Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd; "Explores himself in vain, in every part, "And gives no rest to his distracted heart. "So when the sun by day, or moon by night, "Strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light, "The glitt'ring species variously divide, "And cast their dubious beams from side to side: "Now on the walls, now on the pavement play, "And to the cieling flash the glaring day  208 ." He appears to be indebted for this passage to Apollonius Rhodius: "In sad review dire scenes of horror rise, "Quick beats her heart, from thought to thought she flies: "As from the stream-stor'd vase with dubious ray "The sun-beams dancing from the surface play: "Now here, now there, the trembling radiance falls, "Alternate flashing round th'illumin'd walls: "Thus fluttering bounds the trembling virgin's blood, "And from her eyes descends a pearly flood  209 ." In this description, Virgil, as usual, has much improved upon his original; and particularly in that circumstance, which is the most essential of all, that on which the fitness of the comparison depends, and which forms the hinge, as it were, upon which it turns, he has greatly surpassed the ancient author. It appears, therefore, that in comparisons, the chief design of which is ornament or variety, the principal excellence results from the introduction of an image different in kind, but correspondent in some particular circumstances. There are, however, two capital imperfections, to which this figure is sometimes liable: one, when objects too dissimilar, and dissimilar chiefly in the adjuncts or circumstances, are forced into comparison; the other, and not less common or important, though perhaps less adverted to, when the relation or resemblance is in general too exact and minute. The comparison in the one case is monstrous and whimsical  210 ; in the other it is groveling and inanimate. Examples innumerable in illustration of the present subject might be found in the sacred poetry: I shall, however, produce not more than two from Isaiah. The first from the historical narration of the confederacy between the Syrians and the Israelites against the kingdom of Judah, "which when it was told unto the king," says the prophet, his heart was moved, and the hearts of his people, as the trees of the wood are "moved with the wind  211 ." The other is a poetical comparison, which is fuller and more diffuse than the custom of the Hebrews generally admits; the subject of correspondent application, however, is perfectly exact. The divine grace  212 and its effects, are compared with showers that fertilize the earth: an image which is uniformly appropriated to that purpose: "Verily like as the rain descendeth, "And the snow from the heavens; "And thither it doth not return: "But moisteneth the earth, "And maketh it generate, and put forth its increase; "That it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: "So shall be the word which goeth from my mouth; "It shall not return unto me fruitless; "But it shall effect, what I have willed; "And make the purpose succeed, for which I have sent it  213 ." More examples, and of superior elegance, may be found in the Song of Solomon 214 : it must not, indeed, be dissembled, that there are some in that poem, which are very reprehensible, on account of that general dissonance, and fanciful agreement, which I have just remarked  215 as a great imperfection attending the free use of this figure. We must be cautious, however, lest in some cases we charge the poet with errors, which are in reality our own; since many of the objects, which suggested these comparisons, are greatly obscured, and some of them removed entirely beyond the sphere of our knowledge by distance of time and place. It is the part of a wise man not rashly to condemn what we are able but partially to comprehend. These three forms, according to which, for the sake of perspicuity, I have ventured to class comparisons in general, are however not so incompatible, that they may not occasionally meet, and be variously blended with each other. That indeed appears to be the most perfect comparison, which combines all these different objects, and while it explains, serves at the same time to amplify and embellish the subject; and which possesses evidence and elevation seasoned with elegance and variety. A more complete example is scarcely to be found than that passage, in which Job impeaches the infidelity and ingratitude of his friends, who in his adversity denied him those consolations of tenderness and sympathy, which in his prosperous state, and when he needed them not, they had lavished upon him: he compares them with streams, which, increased by the rains of winter, overflow their borders, and display for a little time a copious and majestic torrent; but with the first impulse of the solar beams are suddenly dried up, and leave those, who unfortunately wander through the deserts of Arabia, destitute of water, and perishing with thirst 216 . Thus far of Comparisons in general, and of their matter and intention: it remains to add a few words concerning the particular form and manner, in which the Hebrews usually exhibit them. The Hebrews introduce Comparisons more frequently perhaps than the poets of any other nation; but the brevity of them in general compensates for their abundance. The resemblance usually turns upon a single circumstance; that they explain in the most simple terms, rarely introducing any thing at all foreign to the purpose. The following example, therefore, is almost singular, since it is loaded with an extraordinary accession, or I might almost say a superfluity of adjuncts: "Let them be as grass upon the house-top, "Which, before it groweth up, is withered: "With which the mower filleth not his hand; "Nor he that gathereth the sheaves his bosom: "Nor do they that pass by say, "The blessing of Jehovah be upon you  217 ; "We bless you in the name of Jehovah 218 ." The usual practice of the Hebrews is, indeed, very different from this: sometimes a single word, and commonly a very short sentence, comprehends the whole comparison. This peculiarity proceeds from the nature of the sententious style, which is always predominant in the Hebrew poetry, and, as I before remarked, consists in condensing and compressing every exuberance of expression, and rendering it close and pointed. Thus, in the very parts in which other poets are copious and diffuse, the Hebrews, on the contrary, are brief, energetic, and animated; not gliding along in a smooth and equal stream, but with the inequality and impetuosity of a torrent. Thus their comparisons assume a peculiar form and appearance; for it is not so much their custom to dilate and embellish each particular image with a variety of adjuncts, as to heap together a number of parallel and analogous comparisons, all of which are expressed in a style of the utmost brevity and simplicity. Moses compares the celestial influence of the divine song, which he utters by the command of God, with showers which water the fields; and on an occasion when a Greek or Latin poet would have been contented with a single comparison, perhaps a little more diffused and diversified, he has introduced two pairs of similes exactly expressive of the same thing: "My doctrine shall drop as the rain; "My language shall alight like the dew: "As the small rain upon the tender herb; "And like the thick drops upon the grass  219 ." The Psalmist makes use of the same form in the following: "O my God! make them as the chaff whirled about; "As the stubble before the wind: "As the fire burneth the forest, "And as the flame kindleth the mountains; "So do thou pursue them with thy tempests, "And with thy whirlwind make them afraid  220 ." This is, indeed, the most common, but by no means the only form which this figure assumes in the Hebrew poetry: there is another, in which the comparison is more diffusively displayed; in which case the equal distribution of the sentences is still strictly adhered to; the image itself, however, is not repeated, but its attributes, which explain one another in two parallel sentences; as Moses has done in a comparison immediately following that which I just now quoted, in which he compares the care and paternal affection of the Deity for his people, with the natural tenderness of the eagle for its young: "As the eagle stirreth up her nest; "Fluttereth over her young; "Expandeth her plumes, taketh them; "Beareth them upon her wings  221 ." The same is observable also in that most elegant comparison of Job, which I formerly commended; and which for this reason I shall now quote entire, by way of conclusion: "My brethren have dealt deceitfully like a torrent, "As the torrents of the vallies they are passed away; "Which are congealed  222 by means of the frost, "The snow hideth itself in their surface; "As soon as they flow, they are dired up, "When it is hot they are consumed from their place; "The paths of their channels are diminished, "They ascend in vapour, and are lost. "Look for them, ye troops of Tema; "Ye travellers of Sheba, expect them earnestly. "They made no haste; because they depended on them; "They came thither, then were they confounded  223 ." Two kinds of Personification: when a character is assigned to fictitious or inanimate objects; and when a probable speech is attributed to a real person \--- Of fictitious and inanimate characters; of real characters \--- The Prosopoeia of the mother of Sisera (in the song of Deborah) explained: also the triumphal song of the Israelites concerning the death of the king of Babylon, (in Isaiah) which consists altogether of this figure, and exhibits it in all its different forms . THE last in order of those figures, which I proposed to treat of, as being most adapted to the parabolic style, is the Prosopooeia, or Personification 224 . Of this figure there are two kinds. One, when action and character are attributed to fictitious, irrational, or even inanimate objects; the other, when a probable but fictitious speech is assigned to a real character. The former evidently partakes of the nature of the Metaphor, and is by far the boldest and most daring of that class of figures. Seasonably introduced, therefore, it has uncommon force and expression; and in no hands whatever is more successful in this respect than in those of the Hebrew writers: I may add also, that none more frequently or more freely introduce it. In the first place then, with respect to fictitious characters, the Hebrews have this in common with other poets, that they frequently assign character and action to an abstract or general idea, and introduce it in a manner acting, and even speaking as upon the stage  225 . In this, while they equal the most refined writers in elegance and grace, they greatly excel the most sublime in force and majesty. What, indeed, can be conceived apter, more beautiful, or more sublime, than that personification of Wisdom, which Solomon so frequently introduces? exhibiting her not only as the director of human life and morals, as the inventor or arts, as the dispenser of wealth, of honour, and of real felicity; but as the immortal offspring of the omnipotent Creator, and as the eternal associate in the divine counsels: "When he prepared the heavens, I was present; When he described a circle on the face of the deep: "When he disposed the atmosphere above; "When he established the fountains of the deep: "When he published his decree to the sea, "That the waters should not pass their bound; "When he planned the foundations of the earth: "Then was I by him as his offspring; "And I was daily his delight; "I rejoiced continually before him. "I rejoiced in the habitable part of his earth, "And my delights were with the sons of men  226 ." How admirable is that celebrated personification of the divine attributes by the Psalmist? How just, elegant, and splendid does it appear, if applied only according to the literal sense, to the restoration of the Jewish nation from the Babylonish captivity? but if interpreted as relating to that sublimer, more sacred and mystical sense, which is not obscurely shadowed under the oftensible image, it is certainly uncommonly noble and elevated, mysterious and sublime: "Mercy and Truth are met together; "Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other  227 ." There are many passages of a similar kind, exquisitely imagined, and, from the boldness of the fiction, extremely forcible. Such is that in Habakkuk, of the Pestilence marching before Jehovah when he comes to vengeance  228 : that in Job, in which Destruction and Death affirm of Wisdom, that her fame only had come to their ears  229 : in fine (that I may not be tedious in quoting examples) that tremendous image in Isaiah, of Hades  230 extending her throat, and opening her insatiable and immeasurable jaws  231 . There is also another most beautiful species of personification, which originates from a well-known Hebrew idiom, and on that account is very familiar to us; I allude to that form of expression, by which the subject, attribute, accident, or effect of any thing is denominated the Son. Hence in the Hebrew poetry, nations, regions, peoples, are brought upon the stage as it were in a female character: "Descend, and sit in the dust, O virgin, daughter of Babylon; "Sit on the bare ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans  232 : "For thou shalt no longer be called the tender and the delicate  233 ." Lo! Sion's daughter prostrate on the earth, All mournful, solitary, weeping, lies! In vain her suppliant hands to heaven extends; She sinks deserted, and no comfort finds  234 . Unless we attend to this peculiar phraseology, such expressions as the "Sons of the bow  235 and of the quiver  236 " for arrows, will seem extremely harsh and unnatural; as well as that remarkable personification of Job, denoting the most miserable death, "The first-born of the progeny of Death  237 " The parabolic style no less elegantly assigns a character and action to inanimate objects than to abstract ideas. The holy prophets, moved with just indignation against the ungrateful people of God, "obtest the Heavens and the Earth, and command universal Nature to be silent  238 . They plead their cause before the Mountains, and the Hills listen to their voice  239 ." All is animated and informed with life, soul, and passion: "Let the Heavens rejoice, and let the Earth be glad; "And let them proclaim through the nations, Jehovah reigneth. "Let the Sea roar, and all that it containeth  240 ; "The World, and the inhabitants thereof: "Let the Floods clap their hands; "Let the Mountains break forth into harmony  241 : "Before Jehovah , for he cometh, "For he cometh to judge the earth  242 ." "The Waters saw thee, O God! "The Waters saw thee, they were grievously troubled  243 ; "The Deep uttered his voice; "And lifted up his hands on high  244 ." And Job admirably in the same style: "Canst thou send forth the Lightnings, and will they go? "Shall they say unto thee, Behold here we are  245 ?" With equal success they introduce objects, which have no existence in the order and economy of nature; though it must be confessed, that it is attended with much greater hazard of propriety; for to those, which are within the province of nature, we readily attribute a degree of life and sentiment. Of this the following dialogue in Jeremiah is an admirable specimen: "Ho! Sword of Jehovah ! "How long wilt thou not be at rest? "Return into thy scabbard, "Return, and be still. "How can it be at rest, "Since Jehovah hath given it a charge? "Against Askelon, and against the sea-coast, "There hath he appointed it  246 ." The other kind of Prosopopoeia, to which I alluded in the former part of this Lecture, is that, by which a probable but fictitious speech is assigned to a real person. As the former is calculated to excite admiration and approbation by its novelty, boldness, and variety; so the latter, from its near resemblance to real life, is possessed of great force, evidence and authority. It would be an infinite task to specify every instance in the sacred poems, which on this occasion might be referred to as worthy of notice; or to remark the easy, the natural, the bold and sudden personifications; the dignity, importance, and impassioned severity of the characters. It would be difficult to describe the energy of that eloquence which is attributed to Jehovah himself, and which appears so suitable in all respects to the Divine Majesty; or to display the force and beauty of the language which is so admirably and peculiarly adapted to each character; the probability of the fiction; and the excellence of the imitation. One example, therefore, must suffice for the present; one more perfect it is not possible to produce. It is expressive of the eager expectation of the mother of Sisera, from the inimitable ode of the prophetess Deborah  247 . The first sentences exhibit a striking picture of maternal solicitude, both in words and actions; and of a mind suspended and agitated between hope and fear: "Through the window she looked and cried out, "The mother of Sisera, through the lattice: "Wherefore is his chariot so long in coming? "Wherefore linger the wheels of his chariot?" Immediately, impatient of his delay, she anticipates the consolations of her friends, and her mind being somewhat elevated, she boasts with all the levity of a fond female; (Vast in her hopes and giddy with success;) "Her wise ladies answer her; "Yea, she returns answer to herself: "Have they not found?---Have they not divided the spoil?" Let us now observe, how well adapted every sentiment, every word is to the character of the speaker. She takes no account of the slaughter of the enemy, of the valour and conduct of the conqueror, of the multitude of the captives, but Burns with a female thirst of prey and spoils. Nothing is omitted, which is calculated to attract and engage the passions of a vain and trifling woman, slaves, gold, and rich apparel. Nor is she satisfied with the bare enumeration of them; she repeats, she amplifies, she heightens every circumstance; she seems to have the very plunder in her immediate possession; she pauses and contemplates every particular: "Have they not found?---Have they not divided the spoil? "To every man a damsel, yea a damsel or two? "To Sisera a spoil of divers colours? "A spoil of needlework of divers colours, "A spoil for the neck  248 of divers colours of needlework on either side." To add to the beauty of this passage, there is also an uncommon neatness in the versification, great force, accuracy, and perspicuity in the diction, the utmost elegance in the repetitions, which, notwithstanding their apparent redundancy, are conducted with the most perfect brevity. In the end, the fatal disappointment of female hope and credulity, tacitly insinuated by the sudden and unexpected apostrophe, "So let all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah !" is expressed more forcibly by this very silence of the person who was just speaking, than it could possibly have been by all the powers of language. But whoever wishes to understand the full force and excellence of this figure, as well as the elegant use of it in the Hebrew ode, must apply to Isaiah, whom I do not scruple to pronounce the sublimest of poets. He will there find, in one short poem, examples of almost every form of the Prosopopoeia, and indeed of all that constitutes the sublime in composition. I trust it will not be thought unseasonable to refer immediately to the passage itself, and to remark a few of the principal excellencies  249 . The prophet, after predicting the liberation of the Jews from their severe captivity in Babylon, and their restoration to their own country, introduces them as reciting a kind of triumphal song upon the fall of the Babylonish monarch, replete with imagery, and with the most elegant and animated personifications. A sudden exclamation, expressive of their joy and admiration on the unexpected revolution in their affairs, and the destruction of their tyrants, forms the exordium of the poem. The Earth itself triumphs with the inhabitants thereof; the Fir-trees, and the Cedars of Lebanon (under which images the parabolic style frequently delineates the kings and princes of the Gentiles) exult with joy, and persecute with contemptuous reproaches the humbled power of a ferocious enemy: "The whole Earth is at rest, is quiet; they burst forth into a joyful shout: "Even the Fir-trees rejoice over thee, the Cedars of Lebanon: "Since thou art fallen, no feller hath come up against us  250 ." This is followed by a bold and animated personification of Hades, or the infernal regions. Hades excites his inhabitants, the ghosts of princes, and the departed spirits of kings: they rise immediately from their seats, and proceed to meet the monarch of Babylon; they insult and deride him, and comfort themselves with the view of his calamity: "Art thou, even thou too, become weak as we? Art thou made like unto us? "Is then thy pride brought down to the grave; the found of thy sprightly instruments? "Is the vermin become thy couch, and the earthworm thy covering?" Again, the Jewish people are the speakers, in an exclamation after the manner of a funeral lamentation, which indeed the whole form of this composition exactly imitates  251 The remarkable fall of this powerful monarch is thus beautifully illustrated: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning  252 !" "Art cut down from earth, thou that didst subdue the nations!" He himself is at length brought upon the stage, boasting in the most pompous terms of his own power, which furnishes the poet with an excellent opportunity of displaying the unparalleled misery of his downfal. Some persons are introduced, who find the dead carcass of the king of Babylon cast out and exposed; they attentively contemplate it, and at last scarcely know it to be his: "Is this the man, that made the earth to tremble; that shook the kingdoms? "That made the world like a desert; that destroyed the cities  253 ." They reproach him with being denied the common rites of sepulture, on account of the cruelty and atrocity of his conduct; they execrate his name, his offspring, and their posterity. A solemn address, as of the Deity himself, closes the scene, and he denounces against the king of Babylon, his posterity, and even against the city, which was the seat of their cruelty, perpetual destruction, and confirms the immutability of his own counsels by the solemnity of an oath. How forcible is this imagery, how diversified, how sublime! how elevated the diction, the figures, the sentiments!---The Jewish nation, the Cedars of Lebanon, the Ghosts of departed kings, the Babylonish monarch, the Travellers who find his corpse, and last of all Jehovah himself, are the characters which support this beautiful Lyric Drama. One continued action is kept up, or rather a series of interesting actions are connected together in an incomparable whole: this, indeed, is the principal and distinguished excellence of the sublimer ode, and is displayed in its utmost perfection in this poem of Isaiah, which may be considered as one of the most ancient, and certainly the most finished specimen of that species of composition, which has been transmitted to us. The personifications here are frequent, yet not confused; bold, yet not improbable: a free, elevated, and truly divine spirit pervades the whole; nor is there any thing wanting in this ode to defeat its claim to the character of perfect beauty and sublimity. If, indeed, I may be indulged in the free declaration of my own sentiments on this occasion, I do not know a single instance in the whole compass of Greek and Roman poetry, which, in every excellence of composition, can be said to equal, or even to approach it. PARTICULAR. 254 III. In what manner the word Mashal implies the idea of Sublimity--- Sublimity of language and sentiment---On what account the poetic diction of the Hebrews, either considered in itself, or compared with prose composition, merits an appellation expressive of sublimity---The sublimity of the poetic diction arises from the passions---How far the poetic diction differs from prose among the Hebrews---Certain forms of poetic diction and construction exemplified from Job , Ch. iii. HAVING in the preceding Lectures given my sentiments at large on the nature of the figurative style, on its use and application in poetry, and particularly in the poetry of the Hebrews; I proceed to treat of the Sublimity of the sacred poets; a subject which has been already illustrated by many examples quoted upon other occasions; but which, since we have admitted it as a third characteristic of the poetic style, now requires to be distinctly explained. We have already seen, that this is implied in one of the senses of the word Mashal , it being expressive of power, or supreme authority, and when applied to style, seems particularly to intimate something eminent or energetic, excellent or important. This is certainly understood in the phrase "to take (or lift) up his parable;" that is, to express a great or lofty sentiment. The very first instance, in which the phrase occurs, will serve as an example in point. For in this manner Balaam "took up," as our translation renders it, "his parable, and said:" "From Aram I am brought by Balak, "By the king of Moab from the mountains of the East: "Come, curse me Jacob; "And come, execrate Israel. "How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed? "And how shall I execrate whom God hath not execrated? "For from the tops of the rocks I see him, "And from the hills I behold him; "Lo! the people, who shall dwell alone, "Nor shall number themselves among the nations! "Who shall count the dust of Jacob? "Or the number of the fourth of Israel? "Let my soul die the death of the righteous, "And let my end be as his  255 " Let us now consider, on what account this address of the prophet is entitled Mashal . The sentences are indeed accurately distributed in parallelisms, as may be discovered even in the translation, which has not entirely obscured the elegance of the arrangement: and compositions in this form, we have already remarked, are commonly classed among the proverbs and adages, which are properly called Mashalim , though perhaps they contain nothing of a proverbial or didactic nature. But if we attentively consider this very passage, or others introduced by the same form of expression, we shall find, in all of them, either an extraordinary variety of figure and imagery; or an elevation of style and sentiment; or perhaps an union of all these excellencies; which will induce us to conclude, that something more is meant by the term to which I am alluding than the bare merit of a sententious neatness. If again we examine the same passage in another point of view, we shall discover in it little or nothing of the figurative kind, at least according to our ideas, or according to that acceptation of the word Mashal which denotes figurative language; there is evidently nothing in it of the mystical kind, nothing allegorical, no pomp of imagery, no comparison, and in fourteen verses but a single metaphor: as far, therefore, as figurative language is a characteristic of the parabolic style, this is no instance of it. We must then admit the word Parable, when applied to this passage, to be expressive of those exalted sentiments, that spirit of sublimity, that energy and enthusiasm, with which the answer of the prophet is animated. By this example I wished to explain on what reasons I was induced to suppose that the term Mashal , as well from its proper power or meaning, as from its usual acceptation, involves an idea of sublimity; and that the Hebrew poetry expresses in its very name and title, the particular quality in which it so greatly excels the poetry of all other nations. The word Sublimity I wish in this place to be understood in its most extensive sense: I speak not merely of that sublimity, which exhibits great objects with a magnificent display of imagery and diction; but that force of composition, whatever it be, which strikes and overpowers the mind, which excites the passions, and which expresses ideas at once with perspicuity and elevation; not solicitous whether the language be plain or ornamented, refined or familiar: in this use of the word I copy Longinus, the most accomplished author on this subject, whether we consider his precepts or his example  256 The sublime consists either in language or sentiment, or more frequently in an union of both, since they reciprocally assist each other, and since there is a necessary and indissoluble connexion between them: this, however, will not prevent our considering them apart with convenience and advantage. The first object, therefore, which presents itself for our investigation, is, upon what grounds the poetic diction of the Hebrews, whether considered in itself, or in comparison with prose composition, is deserving of an appellation immediately expressive of sublimity. The poetry of every language has a style and form of expression peculiar to itself; forcible, magnificent, and sonorous; the words pompous and energetic; the composition singular and artificial; the whole form and complexion different from what we meet with in common life, and frequently (as with a noble indignation) breaking down the boundaries by which the popular dialect is confined. The language of Reason is cool, temperate, rather humble than elevated, well arranged and perspicuous, with an evident care and anxiety lest any thing should escape which might appear perplexed or obscure. The language of the Passions is totally different: the conceptions burst out in a turbid stream, expressive in a manner of the internal conflict; the more vehement break out in hasty confusion; they catch (without search or study) whatever is impetuous, vivid, or energetic. In a word, Reason speaks literally, the Passions poetically. The mind, with whatever passion it be agitated, remains fixed upon the object that excited it; and while it is earnest to display it, is not satisfied with a plain and exact description; but adopts one agreeable to its own sensations, splendid or gloomy, jocund or unpleasant. For the passions are naturally inclined to amplification; they wonderfully magnify and exaggerate whatever dwells upon the mind, and labour to express it in animated, bold, and magnificent terms. This they commonly effect by two different methods; partly by illustrating the subject with splendid imagery, and partly by employing new and extraordinary forms of expression, which are indeed possessed of great force and efficacy in this respect especially, that they in some degree imitate or represent the present habit and state of the soul. Hence those theories of Rhetoricians, which they have so pompously detailed, attributing that to art, which above all things is due to nature alone: "For nature to each change of fortune forms "The secret soul, and all its passions warms: "Transports to rage, dilates the heart with mirth, "Wrings the sad soul, and bends it down to earth. "The tongue these various movements must express  257 "--- A principle which pervades all poetry, may easily be conceived to prevail even in a high degree in the poetry of the Hebrews. Indeed we have already seen how daring these writers are in the selection of their imagery, how forcible in the application of it; and what elegance, splendour, and sublimity they have by these means been enabled to infuse into their compositions. With respect to the diction also, we have had an opportunity of remarking the peculiar force and dignity of their poetic dialect; as well as the artificial distribution of the sentences, which appears to have been originally closely connected with the metrical arrangement, though the latter be now totally lost. We are therefore in the next place to consider whether there be any other remarkable qualities in the poetical language of the Hebrews, which serve to distinguish it from prose composition. It is impossible to conceive any thing more simple and unadorned than the common language of the Hebrews. It is plain, correct, chaste, and temperate; the words are uncommon neither in their meaning nor application; there is no appearance of study, nor even of the least attention to the harmony of the periods. The order of the words is generally regular and uniform. The verb is the first word in the sentence, the noun, which is the agent, immediately succeeds, and the other words follow in their natural order. Each circumstance is exhibited at a single effort, without the least perplexity or confusion of the different parts: and, what is remarkable, by the help of a simple particle, the whole is connected from the beginning to the end in a continued series, so that nothing appears inconsistent, abrupt, or confused. The whole composition, in fine, is disposed in such an order, and so connected by the continued succession of the different parts, as to demonstrate clearly the regular state of the author, and to exhibit the image of a sedate and tranquil mind. But in the Hebrew poetry the case is different, in part at least, if not in the whole. The free spirit is hurried along, and has neither leisure nor inclination to descend to those minute and frigid attentions. Frequently, instead of disguising the secret feelings of the author, it lays them quite open to public view; and the veil being as it were suddenly removed, all the affections and emotions of the soul, its sudden impulses, its hasty sallies and irregularities, are conspicuously displayed. Should the curious inquirer be desirous of more perfect information upon this subject, he may satisfy himself, I apprehend, with no great labour or difficulty. Let him take the book of Job; let him read the historical proem of that book; let him proceed to the metrical parts, and let him diligently attend to the first speech of Job. He will, I dare believe, confess, that, when arrived at the metrical part, he feels as if he were reading another language; and is surprized at a dissimilarity in the style of the two passages much greater than between that of Livy and Virgil, or even Herodotus and Homer. Nor indeed could the fact be otherwise according to the nature of things; since in the latter passage the most exquisite pathos is displayed, such indeed as has not been exceeded, and scarcely equalled by any effort of the Muses. Not only the force, the beauty, the sublimity of the sentiments are unrivalled; but such is the character of the diction in general, so vivid is the expression, so interesting the assemblage of objects, so close and connected the sentences, so animated and passionate the whole arrangement, that the Hebrew literature itself contains nothing more poetical. The greater part of these beauties are so obvious, that they cannot possibly escape the eye of a diligent reader; there are some, however, which, depending chiefly upon the arrangement and construction, are of a more abstruse nature. It also sometimes happens, that those beauties which may be easily conceived, are very difficult to be explained: while we simply contemplate them, they appear sufficiently manifest; if we approach nearer, and attempt to touch and handle them, they vanish and escape. Since, however, it would not be consistent with my duty on the present occasion to pass them by totally unregarded, I shall rely, Gentlemen, upon your accustomed candour, while I attempt to render, if possible, some of these elegancies more obvious and familiar. The first thing that arrests the attention of the reader in this passage, is the violent sorrow of Job, which bursts forth on a sudden, and flows from his heart, where it had long been confined and suppressed: "Let the day perish, I was born in it; (i.e. in which I was born) "And the night (which) said a man is conceived.  258 " Observe here the concise and abrupt form of the first verse; and in the second the boldness of the figure, and the still more abrupt conclusion. Let the reader then consider, whether he could endure such a spirited, vehement, and perplexed form of expression in any prose composition; or even in verse, unless it were expressive of the deepest pathos  259 He will nevertheless, I doubt not, acknowledge that the meaning of this sentence is extremely clear, so clear indeed, that if any person should attempt to make it more copious and explanatory, he would render it less expressive of the mind and feelings of the speaker. It happens fortunately that we have an opportunity of making the experiment upon this very sentiment. There is a passage of Jeremiah so exactly similar, that it might almost be imagined a direct imitation: the meaning is the same, nor is there any very great difference in the phraseology; but Jeremiah fills up the ellipses, smooths and harmonizes the rough and uncouth language of Job, and dilates a short distich into two equal distichs, consisting of somewhat longer verses, which is the measure he commonly makes use of: "Cursed be the day on which I was born, "The day on which my mother bare me, let it not be blessed. "Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, "Saying, there is a male child born unto thee; "Making him exceedingly glad  260 " Thus it happens, that the imprecation of Jeremiah has more in it of complaint than of indignation; it is milder, softer, and more plaintive, peculiarly calculated to excite pity, in moving which the great excellence of this prophet consists: while that of Job is more adapted to strike us with terror than to excite our compassion.  261 But to proceed. I shall not trouble you with a tedious discussion of those particulars which are sufficiently apparent; the crouded and abrupt sentences, which seem to have little connexion, bursting from the glowing bosom with matchless force and impetuosity; the bold and magnificent expressions, which the eloquence of indignation pours forth, four instances of which occur in the space of twice as many verses  262 and which seem to be altogether poetical: two of them indeed are found continually in the poets, and in them only; the others are still more uncommon. Omitting these, therefore, the object which at present seems more worthy of examination, is, that redundancy of expression, which in a few lines takes place of the former excessive conciseness: "That night---let darkness seize upon it  263 " In this also there is the strongest indication of passion, and a perturbid mind. He doubtless intended at first to express himself in this manner: "Be that night darkness  264 But in the very act of uttering it, he suddenly catches at an expression, which appears more animated and energetic. I do not know that I can better illustrate this observation than by referring to a passage in Horace, in which a similar transition and redundancy falls from the indignant poet: "He who---(bane of the fruitful earth! "Curst was the hour that gave thee birth!) "He---O vile pernicious tree! "Was surely curst who planted thee, "Well may I think the parricide "In blood his guilty soul had dy'd, "Or plung'd his dagger in the breast, "At midnight, of his sleeping guest, "Or temper'd every baleful juice, "Which pois'nous Cholchian glebes produce, "Or if a blacker crime be known, "That crime the wretch had made his own  265 " For undoubtedly the poet begun, as if he intended to pursue the subject in a regular order, and to finish the sentence in this form. "He who---planted thee; he was accessory to the murder of his parents, and sprinkled his chambers with the blood of his guest; he dealt in the poison of Cholchis," &c. But anger and vexation dissipated the order of his ideas, and destroyed the construction of this sentence. But should some officious Grammarian take in hand the passage, (for this is a very diligent race of beings, and sometimes more than sufficiently exact and scrupulous) and attempt to restore it to its primitive purity and perfection, the whole grace and excellence of that beautiful exordium would be immediately annihilated, all the impetuosity and ardour would in a moment be extinguished.---But to return to Job: "Lo! that night, may it be fruitless  266 !" He appears to have a direct picture or image of that night before his eyes, and to point it out with his finger. "The doors of my womb" for "the doors of my mother's womb  267 " is an elliptical form of expression, the meaning of which is easily cleared up, but which no person in a tranquil state of mind, and quite master of himself, would venture to employ. Not to detain you too long upon this subject, I shall produce only one passage more, which is about the conclusion of this animated speech: "Wherefore should he give light to the miserable? "And life to those who are in bitterness of soul? "Who call aloud for death, but it cometh not; "Who dig for it more than for hidden treasures. "Who would rejoice even to exultation, "And be in raptures, if they had found the grave. "Well might it befit the man whose way is sheltered, "And whom God hath surrounded with an hedge. "But my groaning cometh like my daily food, "And my roarings are poured out like water  268 ." The whole composition of this passage is admirable, and deserves a minute attention. "Wherefore should he give light to the miserable?" ---But who is the giver alluded to? Certainly God himself, whom Job has indeed in his mind; but it escaped his notice that no mention is made of him in the preceding lines. He seems to speak of the miserable in general, but by a violent and sudden transition he applies the whole to himself, "But my groaning cometh like my daily food." It is plain, therefore, that in all the preceding reflexions he has himself only in view. He makes a transition from the singular to the plural, and back again, a remarkable amplification intervening, expressive of his desire of death, the force and boldness of which is incomparable; at last, as if suddenly recollecting himself, he returns to the former subject, which he had apparently quitted, and resumes the detail of his own misery. From these observations I think it will be manifest, that the agitated and disordered state of the speaker's mind is not more evidently demonstrated by a happy boldness of sentiment and imagery, and an uncommon force of language, than by the very form, conduct, and arrangement of the whole. The peculiar property which I have laboured to demonstrate in this passage, will, I apprehend, be found to prevail as a characteristic of the Hebrew poetry, making due allowance for different subjects and circumstances; I mean that vivid and ardent style, which is so well calculated to display the emotions and passions of the mind. Hence the poetry of the Hebrews abounds with phrases and idioms totally unsuited to prose composition, and which frequently appear to us harsh and unusual, I had almost said unnatural and barbarous; which, however, are destitute neither of meaning, nor of force, were we but sufficiently informed to judge of their true application. It will, however, be worth our while, perhaps, to make the experiment on some other passages of this nature, and to try at least what can be done towards the further elucidation of this point. The character of the Poetic Dialect further illustrated by examples of different kinds from the Song of Moses , Deut . xxxii.--- The frequent and sudden transition from one person to another; its cause and effects---The use of the Tenses in a manner quite different from common language: the reasons of this---The Hebrew language peculiar in this respect---The future is often spoken of in the perfect present, and the past in the future Tense: the reason of the former easy to be explained; the latter is a matter of considerable difficulty, which neither the Commentators, the Translators, nor even the Grammarians have elucidated---Some examples of this, and the explanation of them---The frequent use of this form of construction may be considered as characteristical of the Poetic Dialect . IN order to demonstrate more completely the sublimity of the Hebrew poetry by a comparison with prose, I referred the student of Hebrew to the Book of Job, convinced that he would easily perceive, both in the matter and diction a very considerable difference between the historical introduction of that book, and the metrical passages immediately succeeding. But lest these passages should be objected to, as improper instances for such a comparison, on the supposition that, although both of them were written entirely either in verse or prose, yet the different nature of the subjects would require a very different style; we shall now make the experiment on some other passages, and compare the manner of treating the same subject in verse and prose. The Book of Deuteronomy will afford us a convenient instance; for Moses appears there in the character both of an orator and a poet. In the former character, he addresses a very solemn and interesting oration to the people of Israel  269 , exhorting them, by the most inviting promises, to the observance of the covenant, and dissuading them from the violation of it by threats of the most exemplary punishment: and for the purpose of impressing the same more forcibly on their minds, he afterwards, by the command of God, embellishes the subject with all the elegance of verse  270 in a poem, which bears every mark of divine inspiration. In these two passages is displayed every excellence of which the Hebrew language is capable in both species of composition; all that is grand, forcible, and majestic, both in prose and verse: From them too we may be enabled easily to comprehend the difference between the style of oratory among the Hebrews, and that of their poetry, not only in sentiment, but in the imagery, the arrangement, and the language. Whoever wishes, therefore, to satisfy himself concerning the true character and genius of the Hebrew poetry, I would advise carefully to compare the two passages, and I think he will soon discover that the former, though great, spirited', and abounding with ornament, is notwithstanding regular, copious, and diffuse; that, with all its vehemence and impetuosity, it still preserves a smoothness, evenness, and uniformity throughout; and that the latter, on the contrary, consists of sentences, pointed, energetic, concise, and splendid; that the sentiments are truly elevated and sublime, the language bright and animated, the expression and phraseology uncommon; while the mind of the poet never continues fixed to any single point, but glances continually from one object to another. These remarks are of such a nature, that the diligent reader will apprehend them better by experience and his own observation, than by means of any commentary or explanation whatever. There are, however, one or two points which have attracted my notice in the perusal of this remarkable poem; and as they are of general use and application, and may serve to elucidate many of the difficult passages of the Hebrew poetry, they appear to me not undeserving of a more particular examination. Taking, therefore, this poem as an example, the first general observation, to which I would direct your attention, is the sudden and frequent change of the persons, and principally in the addresses or expostulations; for enough has been said already concerning the introduction of different characters or personifications. In the exordium of this poem, Moses displays the truth and justice of Almighty God, most sacredly regarded in all his acts and counsels: whence he takes occasion to reprove the perfidy and wickedness of his ungrateful people; at first as if his censure were only pointed at the absent, "Their evil disposition hath corrupted his children, which are indeed no longer his  271 : He then suddenly directs his discourse to themselves; "Perverse and crooked generation! "Will ye thus requite Jehovah , "Foolish people and unwise? "Is he not thy father and thy redeemer; "Did he not make thee and form thee?" After his indignation has somewhat subsided, adverting to a remoter period, he beautifully enlarges upon the indulgence, and more than paternal affection, continually manifested by Almighty God towards the Israelites, from the time when he first chose them for his peculiar people; and all this again without seeming directly to apply it to them. He afterwards admirably exaggerates the stupidity and barbarity of this ungrateful people, which exceeds that of the brutes themselves. Observe with what force the indignation of the Prophet again breaks forth: "But Jeshurun grew fat and resisted; "Thou grewest fat, thou wast made thick, thou wast covered with fat! "And he deserted the God that made him, "And despised the rock of his salvation." The abrupt transition in one short sentence to the Israelites, and back again, is wonderfully forcible and pointed, and excellently expressive of disgust and indignation. There is a passage of Virgil, which, though it be less animated, is certainly not unworthy of being compared with this of Moses; it is that in which, by an ingenious apostrophe, he upbraids the traitor with his crime, and at the same time exonerates the king from the imputation of cruelty: By Godlike Tullus doom'd the traitor dies, (And thou, false Metius, dost too late repent Thy violated faith!) by furious steeds In pieces torn, his entrails strew the ground, And the low brambles drink his streaming blood  272 I might proceed, and produce several examples in point from the same poem, and innumerable from other parts of the sacred writings, different from each other both in expression and form. These, however, are sufficient to demonstrate the force of this kind of composition in expressing the more vehement affections, and in marking those sudden emotions, which distract the mind and divide its attention. But whoever will attend with any diligence to the poetry of the Hebrews, will find that examples of this kind almost perpetually occur, and much more frequently, than could be endured in the poetry of the Greeks and Romans, or even in our own: he will find many of these instances not easy to be understood; the force and design of some of them, when separately considered, are indeed scarcely to be explained, or even perfectly comprehended. The reader will not, however, be warranted in concluding from this concession, that those very passages which are most obscure are in themselves absurd, and that they possess no general force or effect in distinguishing the diction, in sustaining the poetic spirit, and in forming that peculiar character, which, however it may differ from what we are accustomed to, is in its kind altogether deserving of applause. In this case we ought to consider the proper genius and character of the Hebrew poetry. It is unconstrained, animated, bold, and servid. The Orientals look upon the language of poetry as wholly distinct from that of common life, as calculated immediately for expressing the passions: if, therefore, it were to be reduced to the plain rule and order of reason, if every word and sentence were to be arranged with care and study, as if calculated for perspicuity alone, it would be no longer what they intended it, and to call it the language of passion would be the grossest of solecisms. The other observation, to which I alluded as relating both to this poem and to the poetry of the Hebrews in general, is, that you there find a much more frequent change or variation of the tenses than occurs in common language. The chief aim of such a transition, is, to render the subject of a narration or description more striking, and even to embody and give it a visible existence 273 Thus, in all languages, in prose as well as poetry, it is usual to speak of past as well as future events in the present tense, by which means whatever is described or expressed is in a manner brought immediately before our eyes; nor does the mind contemplate a distant object, by looking back to the past or forward to the future. But in this respect there is a great peculiarity in the Hebrew language. For the Hebrew verbs have no form for expressing the imperfect or indefinite of the present tense, or an action which now is performing: this is usually effected by a participle only, or by a verb substantive understood, neither of which are often made use of in such passages as these, nor indeed can be always conveniently admitted. They, therefore, take another method of attaining this end, and for the sake of clearness and precision, express future events by the past tense, or rather by the perfect present, as if they had actually taken place; and, on the contrary, past events by the future, as if immediately or speedily to happen, and only proceeding towards their completion. Of the first of these forms of construction, namely, the expressing of the future by the past tense, an instance which we just now quoted will demonstrate both the nature and the effect. Moses foreseeing, by the impulse of divine inspiration, the miserable neglect of the true worship, into which the people of Israel were universally to relapse, reprobates in the following terms the vices of that ungrateful people, as if they had been already committed in his immediate presence: "Their evil disposition hath corrupted his children, which are indeed no longer his." Thus he speaks as if he were the actual witness of their depravity, and present at those impious rites, with which they were about to violate a religion divinely instituted through his means. Nothing can be more efficacious than this kind of anticipation to the clear, evident, and almost ocular demonstration of things. On this account it is a very common mode of expression in the prophetical writings; and in this, as in every other excellence, Isaiah particularly challenges our highest admiration. Observe only with what exactness and perspicuity he has delineated the journey of Sennacherib towards Jerusalem, and the different stages of the army; insomuch that the light and evidence which the Prophet throws upon the circumstances of the prediction, falls nothing short of the clearness and accuracy of an historical narration: "He is come to Aiath; he hath passed to Migron; "At Michmas he will deposit his baggage. "They have passed the strait; Geba is their lodging for the night: "Ramah is frightned; Gibeah of Saul fleeth. "Cry aloud with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim; "Hearken unto her, O Laish; answer her, O Anathoth. "Madmena is gone away; the inhabitants of Gebim flee amain. "Yet this day shall he abide in Nob; "He shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Sion  274 " Thus the plague of locusts is denounced, and described, as if it had already happened, by the Prophet Joel: "For a nation hath gone up on my land, "Who are strong and without number: "They have destroyed my vine, and have made my fig-tree a broken branch. "They have made it quite bare, and cast it away: the branches thereof are made white. "The field is laid waste; the ground, the ground mourneth  275 " The Prophet is undoubtedly here speaking of a future event; for, the very devastation, which, to strike the more forcibly on the mind, he has thus depicted as an event already past, is threatened by him in the sequel under another image to be immediately inflicted  276 unless the people repent of their wickedness. Thus far the Hebrew language differs not materially from others; those future actions or events which other writers, for the sake of force and clearness, express in the imperfect present, the Hebrews express in the perfect present with equal effect. In another point, it must be confessed, they differ essentially from other writers, namely, when they intimate past events in the form of the future tense: and I must add, that this is a matter of considerable difficulty. If we resort to the Translators and Commentators, so far are they from affording any solution, that they do not so much as notice it, accommodating as much as possible the form of the tenses to the subject and context, and explaining it rather according to their own opinions, than according to the rules of Grammar, or any fixed and established principles. If again we apply to the Grammarians, we shall still find ourselves no less at a loss: they, indeed, remark the circumstance, but they neither explain the reason of it, nor yet are candid enough to make a fair consession of their own ignorance. They endeavour to confuse their disciples by the use of a Greek term, and have always at hand a sort of inexplicable and mysterious enallege or change of the tenses, with which rather than say nothing, they attempt to evade a closer inquiry; as if the change were made by accident, and from no principle or motive: than which nothing can be conceived more absurd or impertinent  277 That these apparent anomalies, however, are not without their peculiar force and beauty, I have not a doubt; that many of them should cause difficulty and obscurity, considering the great antiquity of the Hebrew language, is not to be wondered at. Some light may notwithstanding be reflected upon the subject, by a careful attention to the state of the writer's mind, and by considering properly what ideas were likely to be prevalent in his imagination at the time of his writing. There is a remarkable instance of this form of construction in that very long of Moses, to which we have just been alluding. After mentioning the divine dispensation, by which the Israelites were distinguished as the chosen people of God, he proceeds to state with what love and tenderness the Almighty had cherished them, from the time in which he brought them from Egypt, led them by the hand through the wilderness, and, as it were, carried them in his bosom: all these, though past events, are expressed in the future tense: "He will find him in a desert land, "In the vast and howling wilderness: "He will lead him about, he will instruct him; "He will keep him as the pupil of his eye  278 " perfidy of the people, their refractory conduct almost in the very crisis of their deliverance from the Egyptian bondage, he in a manner anticipates in his mind the clemency of God, and the repeated transgressions of the Israelites, and speaks of them as future events: "But he, moved with compassion, will pardon their iniquity, and will not destroy them; "And frequently will turn away his wrath, "Nor will stir up all his indignation.--- "How often will they rebel against him in the desert, "And will grieve him in the wilderness  279 " The general disposition and arrangement of the hundred and fourth Psalm affords a most elegant exemplification of this construction. For the Prophet, instancing the greatness and wisdom of God in the constitution and preservation of the natural world, speaks of the actions and decrees of the Almighty in the present tense, as if he himself had been a witness when they were brought to light; and displays their consequences and uses, and what are called the final causes, in the future tense, as if looking forward from the beginning through all future time. But although these and some other passages will admit of this explanation, there are many to which it will not apply. In these the situation and state of the authors are not so much to be considered, as the peculiar nature or idiom of the language. For the Hebrews frequently make use of the future tense in such a manner, that it appears not to have relation to the present speaker, but to the person or thing which was last spoken of. Thus when any action is connected with another action, or consequent to it; or when the same action is repeated or continued, when a person perseveres in the same action, or performs it with great earnestness or assiduity, this is all expressed as if it were future  280 This form is therefore distinguished by the Grammarians by the appellation Gnatid , which is equivalent to prompt, expedite, or impending. Examples enough to this purpose might be produced from the passages which have been referred to on former occasions: for instance, from that most elegant prosopopoeia of the Mother of Sifera  281 ; from the allegory of the Vine, which was brought out of Egypt  282 ; from the comparison founded on the maternal piety and solicitude of the Eagle  283 : the form and manner of all which may be easily perceived by an attentive reader, but cannot be well explained by the most industrious commentator  284 Now, if, as I have stated, this unusual form of construction be the effect either of some sudden emotion in the speaker, of some new and extraordinary state of mind; or if, on any other account, from the relation of the subject, or the genius of the language, it be possessed of some peculiar force or energy; it will obviously follow, that it must more frequently occur in poetry than in prose, since it is particularly adapted to the nature, the versatility, and variety of the former, and to the expression of any violent passion; and since it has but little affinity to that mildness and temperance of language, which proceeds in one uniform and even tenour. Thus if we attend diligently to the poetry of the Hebrews, and carefully remark its peculiar characteristics, we shall hardly find any circumstance, the regular and artificial conformation of the sentences excepted, which more evidently distinguishes it from the style of prose composition, than the singularity which is now under consideration. For though it be allowed, that this idiom is not so entirely inconsistent with prose, but that a few examples of it might be produced  285 , on the whole I am convinced, that the free and frequent use of it may be accounted as the certain characteristic of poetry. That the full force of these and other peculiarities, which serve to distinguish the poetical diction of the Hebrews, and to preserve that sublimity and splendour for which it is so remarkable, should be fully apparent from a few examples, is hardly to be expected; nor did I flatter myself with any such expectation, when I entered upon this part of my subject. My intention was only to produce an instance or two, which were most likely to occur to those who enter upon this course of reading, and which appeared to demand particular attention. The perfect character and genius, the whole form, principles, and nature of the poetical diction and ornaments, can neither be comprehended in any minute or artificial precepts whatever, nor perhaps be reduced altogether to rule and method: the complete knowledge and perception of these are only to be attained by reading and investigation, united with acuteness of judgment and delicacy of taste. Sublimity of sentiment arises, either from elevation of mind, or from some vehement passion; in each, it is either natural, or the effect of divine inspiration---Elevation of mind is displayed in the greatness of the subject, the adjuncts, and the imagery---Examples from the descriptions of the Divine Majesty; of the works and attributes of the Deity; also from the display of the Divine Power in the form of Interrogation and Irony---The Hebrew poets attribute the human passions to the Deity without departing from sublimity; and that frequently when the imagery appears least consistent with the Divine Majesty: the reason of this . IF we consider the very intimate connexion, which on all occasions subsists between sentiment and language, it will perhaps appear, that the peculiar quality, of which we have just been treating, under the title of Sublimity of Expression, might ultimately be referred to that of Sentiment. In the strictest sense, however, Sublimity of Sentiment may be accounted a distinct quality, and may be said to proceed, either from a certain elevation of mind, and a happy boldness of conception; or from a strong impulse of the soul, when agitated by the more violent affections. The one is called by Longinus Grandeur of Conception , the other Vehemence or Enthusiasm of Passion . To each of these we must have recourse in the present disquisition, and in applying them to the sacred Poets, I shall endeavour to detract nothing from the dignity of that inspiration, which proceeds from higher causes, while I allow to the genius of each writer his own peculiar excellence and accomplishments. I am indeed of opinion, that the Divine Spirit by no means takes such an entire possession of the mind of the Prophet, as to subdue or extinguish the character and genius of the man: the natural powers of the mind are in general elevated and refined, they are neither eradicated nor totally obscured; and though the writings of Moses, of David, and of Isaiah, always bear the marks of a divine and celestial impulse, we may nevertheless plainly discover in them the particular characters of their respective authors. That species of the Sublime, which proceeds from a boldness of spirit, and an elevation of the soul, whether inherent in the author, or derived from a devine impulse and inspiration, is displayed first in the greatness and sublimity of the subject itself; secondly, in the choice of the adjuncts or circumstances (by the importance and magnitude of which a degree of force and elevation is added to the description); and lastly, in the splendour and magnificence of the imagery, by which the whole is illustrated. In all these the Hebrew writers have obtained an unrivalled pre-eminence. As far as respects the dignity and importance of the subject, they not only surpass all other writers, but even exceed the confines of human genius and intellect. The greatness, the power, the justice, the immensity of God; the infinite wisdom of his works and of his dispensations, are the subjects in which the Hebrew Poetry is always conversant, and always excels. If we only consider with a common degree of candour how greatly inferior the poetry of all other nations appears, whenever it presumes to treat of these subjects; and how unequal to the dignity of the matter the highest conceptions of the human genius are found to be; we shall, I think, not only acknowledge the sublimity, but the divinity of that of the Hebrews. Nor does this greatness and elevation consist altogether in the subjects and sentiments, which however expressed, would yet retain some part at least of their native force and dignity, but the manner in which these lofty ideas are arranged, and the embellishments of description with which they abound, claim our warmest admiration: and this, whether we regard the adjuncts or circumstances, which are selected with so much judgment as uniformly to contribute to the sublimity of the principal subject; or the amplitude of that imagery, which represents objects the most remote from human apprehension in such enchanting colours, that, although debased by human painting, they still retain their genuine sanctity and excellence. Since, therefore, the sublimity of the sacred Poets has been already exemplified in a variety of instances, it will probably be sufficient, in addition to these, to produce a few examples as illustrations of these remarks, chiefly taken from those parts of Scripture, in which a delineation of the Divine Majesty is attempted. In the first place then let me recal to your remembrance the solemnity and magnificence with which the power of God in the creation of the universe is depicted. And here, I cannot possibly overlook that passage of the sacred historian, which has been so frequently commended, in which the importance of the cirumstance and the greatness of the idea (the human mind cannot indeed well conceive a greater) is no less remarkable than the expressive brevity and simplicity of the language:---"And God said, Let there be "light, and there was light  286 " The more words you would accumulate upon this thought, the more you would detract from the sublimity of it: for the understanding quickly comprehends the Divine power from the effect, and perhaps most completely, when it is not attempted to be explained; the perception in that case is the more vivid, inasmuch as it seems to proceed from the proper action and energy of the mind itself. The Prophets have also depicted the same conception in poetical language, and with no less force and magnificence of expression. The whole creation is summoned forth to celebrate the praise of the Almighty: "Let them praise the name of Jehovah ; "For he commanded, and they were created  287 " And in another place: "For he spoke, and it was; "He commanded, and it stood fast  288 " The same subject is frequently treated more diffusely, many circumstances being added, and a variety of imagery introduced for the purpose of illustration. Whether this be executed in a manner suitable to the greatness and dignity of the subject, may be easily determined by a few examples: "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? "If thou knowest, declare. "Say, who fixed the proportions of it, for surely thou knowest; "Or who stretched out the line upon it? "Upon what were its foundations fixed? "Or who laid the corner-stone thereof? "When the morning stars sung together, "And all the sons of God shouted for joy. "When the sea was shut up with doors, "When it burst forth as an infant that cometh out of the womb. "When I placed the cloud for its robe, "And thick darkness for its swadling-band. "When I fixed my boundary against it, "When I placed a bar and gates. "When I said, Thus far shalt thou come, and not advance, "And here shall a stop be put to the pride of thy waves  289 " "Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand; "And hath meted out the heavens by his span; "And hath comprehended the dust of the earth in a tierce, "And hath weighted in scales the mountains, and the hills in a balance? "Lift up your eyes on high; "And see who hath created these. "He draweth forth their armies by number; "He calleth them each by its name: "Through the greatness of his strength, and the mightiness of his power, "Not one of them faileth to appear  290 " In these examples, the power and wisdom of the Deity, as demonstrated in the constitution and government of the natural world, you see have suggested a variety of circumstances, a splendid assemblage of imagery, of which it is a sufficient commendation to say, the whole is not unworthy the greatness of the subject. The case is, however, materially different, when the attributes of God are considered in themselves simply and abstractedly, with no illustration or amplification from their operations and effects. Here the human mind is absorbed, overwhelmed as it were in a boundless vortex, and studies in vain for an expedient to extricate itself. But the greatness of the subject may be justly estimated by its difficulty; and while the imagination labours to comprehend what is beyond its powers, this very labour itself, and these ineffectual endeavours, sufficiently demonstrate the immensity and sublimity of the object. On this account the following passage is truly sublime. Here the mind seems to exert its utmost faculties in vain to grasp an object, whose unparalleled magnitude mocks its feeble endeavours; and to this end it employs the grandest imagery that universal nature can suggest, and yet this imagery, however great, proves totally inadequate to the purpose: "O Jehovah , thy mercy extendeth to the heavens; "Thy truth unto the clouds: "Thy justice is as the mountains of strength; "Thy judgment as the vast abyss  291 " But nothing of this kind is nobler or more majestic, than when a description is carried on by a kind of continued negation; when a number of great and sublime ideas are collected, which, on a comparison with the object, are found infinitely inferior and inadequate. Thus the boundaries are gradually extended on every side, and at length totally removed; the mind is insensibly led on towards infinity, and is struck with inexpressible admiration, with a pleasing awe, when it first finds itself expatiating in that immense expanse. There are many such examples in the sacred poetry, one or two of which will probably enable you to recollect the rest. "Canst thou explore the deep counsels of God, "Canst thou fathom the immensity of the Almighty? "It is higher than heaven, what canst thou do? "It is deeper than the abyss, what canst thou know? "The measure thereof is longer than the earth, "And broader than the expanse of the sea  292 " "Whither shall I go from thy spirit? "And whither shall I flee from thy presence? "If I ascend the heavens, thou art there; "If I make my bed in the abyss, behold thou art there! "If I take the wings of the morning, "And dwell in the extreme parts of the occan; "There also thy hand shall lead me, "And thy right hand shall hold me  293 Here we find the idea of Infinity perfectly expressed, though it be perhaps the most difficult of all ideas to impress upon the mind: for when simply and abstractedly mentioned, without the assistance and illustration of any circumstances whatever, it almost wholly evades the powers of the human understanding. The sacred writers have, therefore, recourse to description, amplification, and imagery, by which they give substance and solidity to what is in itself a subtile and unsubstantial phantom; and render an ideal shadow the object of our senses. They conduct us through all the dimensions of space, length, breadth, and height: these they do not describe in general or indefinite terms; they apply to them an actual line and measure, and that the most extensive which all nature can supply, or which the mind is indeed able to comprehend. When the intellect is carried beyond these limits, there is nothing substantial upon which it can rest; it wanders through every part, and when it has compassed the boundaries of creation, it imperceptibly glides into the void of infinity: whose vast and formless extent, when displayed to the mind of man in the forcible manner so happily attained by the Hebrew writers, impresses it with the sublimest and most awful sensations; and fills it with a mixture of admiration and terror. That more vehement species of negation or affirmation, which assumes the confident form of interrogation, is admirably calculated to impress the mind with a very forcible idea of the Divine power. This also frequently occurs in the sacred poetry: "This is the decree which is determined in the whole earth; "And this the hand, which is stretched out over all the nations: "For Jehovah God of Hosts hath decreed; and who shall disannul it? "And it is his hand, that is stretched out; and who shall turn it back  294 "Hath he said, and will he not do it? "Hath he spoken, and will he not establish it  295 ?" Nor is that ironical kind of concession, which is sometimes put into the mouth of the Supreme Being, less energetic; the following passage of Job is an admirable instance: "Deck thyself now with majesty and with pride; "And array thyself in glory and honour: "Pour out on every side the furiousness of thy wrath; "With a glance humble every one that is proud: "Look upon every proud thing, and subvert it; "And trample down the wicked in their place: "Overwhelm them also in dust; "Bind up their faces, and plunge them into darkness. "Then will even I confess unto thee, "That thine own right hand may save thee  296 When the Divine Omnipotence is opposed to human infirmity, the one is proportionably magnified as the other is diminished by the contrast. The monstrous absurdity of a comparison between things extremely unequal, the more forcibly serves to demonstrate that inequality, and sets them at an infinite distance from each other. Since, however, the sacred poets were under the necessity of speaking of God in a manner adapted to human conceptions, and of attributing to him the actions, the passions, the faculties of man; how can they be supposed ever to have depicted the Divine Majesty in terms at all becoming the greatness of the subject? And are they not in this case more likely to disgrace and degrade it? May not that censure be applied to them, which Longinus so deservedly applies to Homer, that he turned his Gods into men, and even debased them beneath the standard of humanity? ---The case is, however, materially different: Homer, and the other heathen poets, relate facts of their deities, which, though impious and absurd, when literally understood, are scarcely, or at all intelligible in an allegorical sense, and can by no means be reduced to an interpretation strictly figurative.  297 On the contrary, in the delineation of the Divine nature, the sacred poets do indeed, in conformity to the weakness of the human understanding, employ terrestrial imagery; but it is in such a manner, that the attributes which are borrowed from human nature and human action, can never in a literal sense be applied to the Divinity. The understanding is continually referred from the shadow to the reality; nor can it rest satisified with the bare literal application, but is naturally directed to investigate that quality in the Divine nature, which appears to be analogous to the image. This, if I am not mistaken, will supply us with a reason not very obvious, of a very observable effect in the Hebrew writings, namely, why, among those sensible images that are applied to the Deity, those principally, which in a literal sense would seem most remote from the object, and most unworthy of the Divine Majesty, are nevertheless, when used metaphorically, or in the way of comparison, by far the most sublime. That imagery, for instance, which is taken from the parts and members of the human body, is found to be much nobler and more magnificent in its effect, than that which is taken from the passions of the mind; and that, which is taken from the animal creation, frequently exceeds in sublimity that which the nature of man has suggested. For such is our ignorance and blindness in contemplating the Divine nature, that we can by no means attain to a simple and pure idea of it: we necessarily mingle something of the human with the divine: the grosser animal properties, therefore, we easily distinguish and separate, but it is with the utmost difficulty that we can preserve the rational, and even some of the properties of the sensitive, soul perfectly distinct. Hence it is, that in those figurative expressions derived from the nobler and more excellent qualities of human nature, when applied to the Almighty, we frequently acquiesce, as if they were in strict literal propriety to be attributed to him: on the contrary, our understanding immediately rejects the literal sense of those which seem quite inconsistent with the Divine Being, and derived from an ignoble source: and, while it pursues the analogy, it constantly rises to a contemplation, which, though obscure, is yet grand and magnificent. Let us observe, whether this observation will apply to the following passages, in which the Psalmist ascribes to God the resentment commonly experienced by a human creature for an injury unexpectedly received: there appears in the image nothing to excite our admiration, nothing particularly sublime: "The Lord heard, and he was enraged; "And Israel he utterly rejected  298 ." But when, a little after, the same subject is depicted in figurative terms, derived from much grosser objects, and applied in a still more daring manner, nothing can be more sublime: "And the Lord awaked, as out of sleep, "Like a strong man shouting because of wine  299 ." On the same principle the sublimity of those passages is founded, in which the image is taken from the roaring of a lion, the clamour of rustic labourers, and the rage of wild beasts: " Jehovah from on high shall roar, "And from his holy habitation shall he utter his voice; "He shall roar aloud against his resting-place, "A shout like that of the vintagers shall he give "Against all the inhabitants of the earth  300 ." "And I will be unto them as a lion; "As a leopard in the way will I watch them: "I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her whelps: "And I will rend the caul of their heart: "And there will I devour them as a lioness; "A beast of the field shall tear them  301 ." From ideas, which in themselves appear coarse, unsuitable, and totally unworthy of so great an object, the mind naturally recedes, and passes suddenly to the contemplation of the object itself, and of its inherent magnitude and importance. Sublimity of sentiment as arising from the vehement affections of the mind--- What is commonly called Enthusiasm is the natural effect of passion: the true Enthusiasm arises from the impulse of the Divine Spirit, and is peculiar to the sacred poets---The principal force of poetry is displayed in the expression of passion: in exciting the passions poetry best atchieves its purpose, whether it be utility or pleasure---How the passions are excited to the purpose of utility; how to that of pleasure---The difference and connexion between the pathetic and the sublime---That sublimity, which in the sacred poetry proceeds from the imitation of the passions of admiration, of joy, indignation, grief, and terror; illustrated by examples . WE have agreed with Longinus, that a violent agitation of the mind, or impetuosity of passion, constitutes another source of the sublime: he calls it "the vehemence and enthusiasm of passion." It will be proper, therefore, in the next place, to consider the nature of this enthusiasm; the principles on which the power of exciting or of imitating the passions in poetry may be supposed to depend; and what affinity subsists between passion and sublimity. The language of poetry I have more than once described as the effect of mental emotion. Poetry itself is indebted for its origin, character, complexion, emphasis, and application, to the effects which are produced upon the mind and body, upon the imagination, the senses, the voice, and respiration by the agitation of passion. Every affection of the human soul, while it rages with violence, is a momentary phrenzy. When therefore a poet is able by the force of genius, or rather of imagination, to conceive any emotion of the mind so perfectly as to transfer to his own feelings the instinctive passion of another, and, agreeably to the nature of the subject, to express it in all its vigour, such a one, according to a common mode of speaking, may be said to possess the true poetic enthusiasm  302 or, as the ancients would have expressed it, "to be inspired; full of the God:" not however implying, that their ardour of mind was imparted by the Gods, but that this extatic impulse became the God of the moment.  303 This species of enthusiasm I should distinguish by the term natural , were it not that I should seem to connect things which are really different, and repugnant to each other: the true and genuine enthusiasm, that which alone is deserving of the name, that I mean with which the sublimer poetry of the Hebrews, and particularly the prophetic, is animated, is certainly widely different in its nature, and boasts a much higher origin. As poetry, however, derives its very existence from the more vehement emotions of the mind, so its greatest energy is displayed in the expression of them; and by exciting the passions it more effectually attains its end. Poetry is said to consist in imitation: whatever the human mind is able to conceive, it is the province of poetry to imitate; things, places, appearances natural and artificial, actions, passions, manners and customs: and since the human intellect is naturally delighted with every species of imitation, that species in particular, which exhibits its own image, which displays and depicts those impulses, inflexions, perturbations, and secret emotions, which it perceives and knows in itself, can scarcely fail to astonish and to delight above every other. The delicacy and difficulty of this kind of imitation are among its principal commendations; for to effect that which appears almost impossible naturally excites our admiration. The understanding slowly perceives the accuracy of the description in all other subjects, and their agreement to their archetypes, as being obliged to compare them by the aid and through the uncertain medium, as it were, of the memory: but when a passion is expressed, the object is clear and distinct at once; the mind is immediately conscious of itself and its own emotions; it feels and suffers in itself a sensation, either the same or similar to that which is described. Hence that sublimity, which arises from the vehement agitation of the passions, and the imitation of them, possesses a superior influence over the human mind; whatever is exhibited to it from without, may well be supposed to move and agitate it less than what it internally perceives, of the magnitude and force of which it is previously conscious. And as the imitation or delineation of the passions is the most perfect production of poetry, so by exciting them it most completely effects its purpose. The intent of poetry is to profit while it entertains us; and the agitation of the passions, by the force of imitation, is in the highest degree both useful, and pleasant. This method of exciting the passions is in the first place useful, when properly and lawfully exercised; that is, when these passions are directed to their proper end, and rendered subservient to the dictates of nature and truth; when an aversion to evil, and a love of goodness is excited; and if the poet deviate on any occasion from this great end and aim, he is guilty of a most scandalous abuse and perversion of his art. For the passions and affections are the elements and principles of human action; they are all in themselves good, useful, and virtuous; and, when fairly and naturally employed, not only lead to useful ends and purposes, but actually prompt and stimulate to virtue. It is the office of poetry to incite, to direct, to temper the passions, and not to extinguish them. It prosesses to exercise, to amend, to discipline the affections: it is this which is strictly meant by Aristotle, when he speaks of the pruning of the passions , though certain commentators have strangely perverted his meaning  304 But this operation on the passions is also more immediately useful, because it is productive of pleasure. Every emotion of the mind, (not excepting even those which in themselves are allied to pain) when excited through the agency of the imitative arts, is ever accompanied with an exquisite sensation of pleasure. This arises partly from the contemplation of the imitation itself; partly from the consciousness of our own felicity, when compared with the miseries of others; but principally from the moral sense  305 Nature has endued man with a certain social and generous spirit; and commands him not to confine has cares to himself alone, but to extend them to all his fellow-creatures; to look upon nothing which relates to mankind as foreign to himself. Thus, "to rejoice with them that do rejoice, and to weep with them that weep;" to love and to respect piety and benevolence; to cherish and retain an indignant hatred of cruelty and injustice; that is, to obey the dictates of nature, is right, is honest, is becoming, is pleasant. The sublime and the pathetic are intrinsically very different; and yet have in some respects a kind of affinity or connexion  306 The pathetic includes the passions which we feel, and those which we excite. Some passions may be expressed without any thing of the sublime; the sublime also may exist, where no passion is directly expressed: there is however no sublimity where no passion is excited. That sensation of sublimity, which arises from the greatness of the thoughts and imagery, has admiration for its basis, and that for the most part connected with joy, love, hatred, or fear; and this I think is evident from the instances which were so lately under our consideration. How much the sacred poetry of the Hebrews excels in exciting the passions  307 and in directing them to their noblest end and aim; how it exercises them upon their proper objects; how it strikes and fires the admiration by the contemplation of the Divine Majesty; and, forcing the affections of love, hope, and joy, from unworthy and terrestrial objects, elevates them to the pursuit of the supreme good: How it also stimulates those of grief, hatred, and fear, which are usually employed upon the trifling miseries of this life to the abhorrence of the supreme evil, is a subject, which at present wants no illustration, and which, though not unconnected with sublimity in a general view, would be improperly introduced in this place. For we are not at present treating of the general effects of sublimity on the passions; but of that species of the sublime which proceeds from vehement emotions of the mind, and from the imitation or representation of passion. Here indeed a spacious field presents itself to our view: for by far the greater part of the sacred poetry is little else than a continued imitation of the different passions. What in reality forms the substance and subject of most of these poems but the passion of admiration, excited by the consideration of the Divine power and majesty; the passion of joy, from the sense of the Divine favour, and the prosperous issue of events; the passion of resentment and indignation against the contemners of God; of grief, from the consciousness of sin; and terror, from the apprehension of the Divine judgment? Of all these, and if there be any emotions of the mind beyond these, exquisite examples may be found in the Book of Job, in the Psalms, in the Canticles, and in every part of the prophetic writings. On this account my principal difficulty will not be the selection of excellent and proper instances, but the explaining of those which spontaneously occur without a considerable diminution of their intrinsic sublimity. Admiration, as it is ever the concomitant, so it is frequently the efficient cause of sublimity. It produces great and magnificent conceptions and sentiments, and expresses them in language bold and elevated, in sentences concise, abrupt and energetic. " "Jehovah reigneth; let the people tremble: "He sitteth upon the Cherubim; let the earth be moved  308 " "The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters: "The God of Glory thunders: "The voice of Jehovah is full of power; "The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty  309 " "Who is like unto thee among the Gods, O Jehovah! "Who is like unto thee, adorable in holiness! "Fearful in praises, who workest wonders! "Thou extendest thy right hand; the earth swalloweth them  310 " Joy is more elevated, and exults in a bolder strain. It produces great sentiments and conceptions, seizes upon the most splendid imagery, and adorns it with the most animated language; nor does it hesitate to risk the most daring and unusual figures. In the Song of Moses, in the Thanksgiving of Deborah and Baruch, what sublimity do we find, in sentiment, in language, in the general turn of the expression! But nothing can excel in this respect that noble exultation of universal nature in the Psalm which has been so often commended, where the whole animated and inanimate creation unite in the praises of their Maker. Poetry here seems to assume the highest tone of trimuph and exultation, and to revel, if I may so express myself, in all the extravagance of joy: Tell in high, harmonious strains, Tell the world, Jehovah reigns! He, who fram'd this beauteous whole, He, who fix'd each planet's place; Who bade unnumber'd orbs to roll, In destin'd course, through endless space. Let the glorious Heavens rejoice, The Hills exult with grateful voice; Let Ocean tell the echoing shore, And the hoarse waves with humble voice adore! Let the verdant plains be glad! The trees in blooming fragrance clad! Smile with joy, ye desert lands, And rushing torrents, clap your hands! Let the whole earth with triumph ring! Let all that live with loud applause He comes! He comes! Heaven's righteous King! To judge the world by Truth's eternal laws  311 Nothing, however, can be greater or more magnificent than the representation of anger and indignation, particularly when the Divine wrath is displayed. Of this the whole of the prophetic Song of Moses affords an incomparable specimen. I have formerly produced from it some instances of a different kind; nor ought the following to be denied a place in these Lectures: "For I will list my hand unto the Heavens, "And I will say, I live for ever; "If I whet the brightness of my sword, "And my hand lay hold on judgment; "I will return vengeance to my enemies, "And I will recompense those that hate me: "I will drench my arrows in blood, "And my sword shall devour flesh; "With the blood of the slain and the captives, "From the bushy head of the enemy  312 " Nor is Isaiah less daring on a similar subject: "For the day of vengeance was in my heart, "And the year of my redeemed was come. "And I looked and there was no one to help; "And I was astonished, that there was no one to uphold: "Therefore mine own arm wrought salvation for me, "And mine indignation itself sustained me. "And I trod down the peoples in mine anger; "And I crushed them in mine indignation; "And I spilled their life-blood on the ground  313 " The display of the fury and threats of the enemy, by which Moses finely exaggerates the horror of their unexpected ruin, is also wonderfully sublime: "The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake; "I will divide the spoil, my soul shall be satiated; "I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them: "Thou didst blow with thy breath; they were covered with the sea  314 ." Grief is generally abject and humble, less apt to assimilate with the sublime; but when it becomes excessive, and predominates in the mind, it rises to a bolder tone, and becomes heated to fury and madness. We have a fine example of this from the hand of Jeremiah, when he exaggerates the miseries of Sion: "He hath bent his bow as an enemy, he hath fixed his right hand as an adversary; "He hath poured out his anger like fire on the tents of the daughter of Sion 315 ." But nothing of this kind can equal the grief of Job, which is acute, vehement, fervid; always in the deepest afflictions breathing an animated and lofty strain; \---for in the conscious bosom flame Virtue, and grief, and soul-depressing shame. "His fury rendeth me, he teareth me to pieces, "He gnasheth on me with his teeth, "Mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. "They run with open mouth upon me, "They smite me reproachfully on the cheek, "They are ready to burst with fury against me. "God hath delivered me over bound to the wicked; "Yea, he hath tumbled me headlong in perdition at the discretion of the impious. "I was in tranquillity, and he rent me asunder; "Yea, he seized me by the neck, and dashed me in pieces; "He hath even set me up as a mark for him. "His archers encompassed me round, "He pierceth through my reins and spareth not; "He poureth out my gall on the ground. "He breaketh me up breach after breach; "He rusheth upon me like a mighty man  316 In the same author, with what magnificence and sublimity are sorrow and desperation expressed! Were but my woes in equal balance weighed, Did the vast mass of misery press the scale Against the sands, that skirt the ocean round, Twould far outweigh them: therefore boils my grief! The pointed arrows of th' offended God Fix'd in my heart rack every tender nerve; And the slow poison drinks my spirit up; While hosts of terrors close besiege my soul. O might thy suppliant urge one poor request! Thywrath, O God! should loose at once thy arm, (Thy vengeful arm which blasting lightnings wields) Dash into pieces this imbecile frame, And crush thy suffering creature into nothing  317 . The whole poem of Job is no less excellent in the expression and excitation of terror, as the example just now quoted sufficiently demonstrates. To this commendation, however, the prophetic writings seem to have the fairest claim; it being indeed their peculiar province to denounce the Divine judgments upon guilty nations. Almost the whole book of Ezekiel is occupied with this passion; Isaiah is also excellent in this respect, although he be in general the harbinger of joy and salvation. The following terrific denunciation, is directed by him against the enemies of Jerusalem: "Howl ye, for the day of Jehovah is at hand: "As a destruction from the Almighty shall it come. "Therefore shall all hands be slackened; "And the heart of every mortal shall melt; and they shall be terrified: "Torments and pangs shall seize them; "As a woman in travail, they shall be pained: "They shall look upon one another with astonishment; "Their countenances shall be like flames of fire. "Behold the day of Jehovah cometh inexorable; "Even indignation, and burning wrath: "To make the land a desolation; "And her sinners shall he destroy from out of her. "Yea, the stars of Heaven, and the constellations thereof, "Shall not send forth their light: "The Sun is darkened at his going forth, "And the Moon shall not cause her light to shine. "And I will visit the world for its evil  318 . "And the wicked for their iniquity: "And I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud: "And I will bring down the haughtiness of the terrible. "I will make a mortal more precious than fine gold; "Yea, a man, than the rich ore of Ophir. "Wherefore I will make the heavens tremble; "And the earth shall be shaken out of her place: "In the indignation of Jehovah God of Hosts  319 ." Jeremiah is scarcely inferior, though perhaps his talents are better suited in common to the exciting of the softer affections. As an example, I need only refer to that remarkable vision, in which the impending slaughter and destruction of Judea is exhibited with wonderful force and enthusiasm: "My bowels, my bowels are pained, the walls of my heart; "My heart is troubled within me; I cannot be silent; "Because I have heard the found of the trumpet, "My soul the alarm of war. "Destruction is come upon the heels of destruction; "Surely the whole land is spoiled: "On a sudden have my tents been spoiled, "My curtains in an instant. "How long shall I see the standard? "Shall I hear the sound of the trumpet?--- "I beheld the earth, and lo! disorder and confusion; "The heavens also, and there was no light  320 ." It would be an infinite task to collect and specify all the passages that might be found illustrative of this subject: and probably we shall have more than one opportunity of discoursing upon these and similar topics, when we come to consider the different species of the Hebrew poetry: upon which, after requesting your candour and indulgence to so arduous an undertaking, it is my intention to enter at our next meeting. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME. OF THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF POETRY EXTANT IN THE WRITINGS OF THE HEBREWS. THE WRITINGS OF THE PROPHETS ARE IN GENERAL POETICAL. The poetry of the Hebrews classed according to its different characters; this mode of arrangement results rather from the nature of the subject, than from any authority of the Hebrews themselves.---The Prophetic Poetry .--- The writings of the prophets in general poetical and metrical.---The opinion of the modern Jews and of Jerome on this point refuted.---In the books of the prophets the same evidences are found of a metrical arrangement as in the poetical books: in the dialect, the style, and poetical conformation of the sentences.---Obvious in respect to the two former circumstances; the latter requires a more minute investigation, and also illustration by examples.---The intimate relation between Poetry and Prophecy.---The college of Prophets; a part of whose discipline it was to sing Hymns to the different instruments; and this exercise was called prophecy: the same word, therefore, denotes a prophet, a poet, and a musician.---Elisha, when about to pronounce the Oracle of God, orders a minstrel to be brought to him.--- Poetry excellently adapted to the purpose of prophecy.---A review of the most ancient predictions extant in the historical books, which are proved to be truly poetical . OF the general nature and properties of the Hebrew poetry I have already treated: diffusely enough, if the extent of the disquisitions be considered; but too briefly, I fear, and too imperfectly, if respect be had to the copiousness and importance of the subject. My original design, however, extended no farther than to notice the most remarkable passages, and such as I conceived to be immediately illustrative of the peculiarities of the Hebrew style. Even these it was my wish and intention rather to point out and recommend to your own consideration, than minutely to investigate and explain, esteeming it my province rather to exhort and stimulate to these studies, than to intrude upon this audience a formal plan of instruction. It would be superfluous, I am persuaded, to remind you, that the importance of the subject is not to be estimated by the feebleness of my endeavours; and, I trust, it would be still more unnecessary to caution you against a hasty acquiescence in any interpretation of those passages, which I have quoted, much less in my own: though I will frankly confess, that I have bestowed no small degree of labour and attention upon this part of my undertaking. What remains at present, is to distribute into its different classes the whole of the Hebrew poetry, and to mark whatever is worthy of observation in each species. In forming this arrangement it will hardly be expected that I should uniformly proceed according to the testimony of the Hebrews, or on all occasions confirm the propriety of my classification by their authority; since it is plain that they were but little versed in these nice and artificial distinctions. It will be sufficient for our purpose; that is, it will be sufficient for the accurate explanation of the different characters of the Hebrew poetry, if I demonstrate that these characters are stamped by the hand of nature, and that they are displayed either in the subject itself, the disposition of its constituent parts, the diversity of style, or in the general form and arrangement of the poem. The first rank I assign to the Prophetic , or that species of poetry which is found to pervade the predictions of the prophets, as well those contained in the books properly called prophetical, as those which occasionally occur in other parts of the Scriptures. These, I apprehend, will be generally allowed to be written in a style truly poetical, indeed admirable in its kind; as the many examples, which we have already produced, will sufficiently demonstrate. I fear, however, it will not be so readily granted that their claim is equally well-founded with that of the books, which are commonly called poetical, to the other characteristic of poetry, I mean verse, or metrical composition. This fact is denied by the Jews  321 ; and is denied by Jerome  322 , who was a diligent scholar of the Rabbinical writers: after these, it is unnecessary to refer to more recent authors, who partly deny that the Hebrews were possessed of any metre at all, and partly allow it to those compositions only, which are commonly called poetical, or at most extend the concession to a few canticles scattered through other parts of the Scriptures. A thinking person, however, will not be misled by such authorities as these, before he examines whether they are to be accounted competent judges in this case, and what weight and credit is due to their testimony. The Jews, by their own confession, are no longer, nor have been indeed for many ages, masters of the system of the ancient metre. All remembrance of it has ceased from those times in which the Hebrew became a dead language  323 ; and it really seems probable, that the Masorites (of whom so little is known) who afterwards distinguished the sacred volumes by accents and vowel points, as they are now extant, were possessed of so trifling and imperfect a knowledge of this subject, that they were even incapable of distinguishing what was written in metre from plain prose. For when, according to their manner, they marked certain books as metrical, namely, the Psalms, the Proverbs, and the book of Job; they accounted others, which are no less evidently metrical, absolutely prosaick, such as the Song of Solomon, and the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and consequently assigned to them the common prose accent only. In this opinion the Jews universally remain, and deny that these books are at all metrical, or to be classed with the three former  324 . Now the disciple is hardly to be supposed to have more information than his masters; and although Jerome speaks very fluently about the Tetrameters, the Hexameters, the Sapphics, and Iambics of the Hebrews, the very state and circumstances of the case demonstrate how little credit is due to his authority. Indeed his reasoning evidently proceeds from a confused head, when he attempts to trace a sort of remote similarity between the Greek and Hebrew metres; and to explain by some coarse analogies a subject, which he appears to have very imperfectly understood: in treating of which, after all, he is not able to preserve even the appearance of consistency. For instance, after Josephus and Origen, he contends  325 , that the Song of Moses in Deuteronomy is composed in Hexameter and Pentameter verse; in another place, however, he affirms that the very same poem consists of Iambic Tetrameters  326 . In proof of his opinion he appeals to the testimony of Philo, Josephus, Origen, and Eusebius 327 , who were no less ignorant of the nature of the Hebrew metres than himself. Notwithstanding the opinion therefore of Jerome and the Rabbinical writers, I shall beg leave to offer a few remarks upon the other side of the question; after which it will not perhaps be thought altogether improbable, that most of the predictions of the prophets, as well as many other of the remains of Hebrew literature, were originally published in a metrical form. In order to prove that the predictions of the prophets are metrical, I must in part have recourse to the same arguments, by which I formerly endeavoured to evince that the Hebrew poetry in general consisted of a kind of metre: every one of which arguments, I must observe, is strictly applicable to this part of my subject, that alone excepted which regards the alphabetic poems. That it would be unnatural and absurd to look for instances of that kind in the prophetic poetry is evident; since such an artificial arrangement would be utterly repugnant to the nature of prophecy; it is plainly the effect of study and diligence, not of imagination and enthusiasm; a contrivance to assist the memory, not to affect the passions. The other arguments, however, ought to be particularly adverted to upon this subject: the poetic dialect for instance, the diction so totally different from the language of common life, and other similar circumstances  328 , which an attentive reader will easily discover, but which cannot be explained by a few examples; for circumstances which, taken separately, appear but of small account, are in a united view frequently of the greatest importance. To these we may add the artificial conformation of the sentences; which, as it has always appeared to me a necessary concomitant of metrical composition, the only one indeed which is now apparent, I shall afterwards endeavour to explain more at large, having especial regard to the prophetic writers. I must now premise a few other arguments, which will probably lead to the establishment of my opinion. The prophets were chosen by God himself, and were certainly excellently prepared for the execution of their office. They were in general taken from those, who had been educated from childhood in a course of discipline adapted to the ministerial function. It is evident from many parts of the Sacred History, that even from the earliest times of the Hebrew Republic, there existed certain colleges of prophets, in which the candidates for the prophetic office, removed altogether from an intercourse with the world, devoted themselves entirely to the exercises and study of religion: over each of these some prophet of superior authority, and more peculiarly under the divine influence, presided, as the moderator and preceptor of the whole assembly. Though the Sacred History affords us but little information, and that in a cursory manner, concerning their institutes and discipline; we nevertheless understand that a principal part of their occupation consisted in celebrating the praises of Almighty God in hymns and poetry, with choral chants accompanied by stringed instruments and pipes. There is a remarkable passage 329 which occurs to this purpose: Saul being nominated King, and, pursuant to the command of God, consecrated by a solemn unction, a company of the prophets, as Samuel had foretold, descending from the Mount of God (that being the place in which the sacred college was situated) met him; and, preceded by a variety of musical instruments, prophesied : upon hearing which, he himself, as if actuated by the same spirit, immediately joined them, and prophesied also. The same thing again occurred to him, and the persons sent by him to take David prisoner at Naioth  330 ; who, when they saw the prophets prophesying, and Samuel presiding over them, seized with the same divine spirit and enthusiasm, began to prophesy along with them. I find no discordance among authors concerning the nature of this mode of prophesying: all are, I believe, agreed in this point, and all understand by it the praises of God celebrated, by the impulse of the Holy Spirit, with music and song. In this they follow the authority of the Chaldee interpreters, or rather the evidence of reason itself: for exactly in the same manner, Asaph, Heman, Iduthun, who were the chief musicians in the Temple, are said "to have prophesied upon the harp, the psaltery, and the cymbal, when praise and thanksgiving were offered to Jehovah 331 ." From these instances it is sufficiently apparent, that the word Nabi was used by the Hebrews in an ambiguous sense, and that it equally denoted a Prophet, a Poet, or a Musician, under the influence of divine inspiration. To these we may add the prophetesses, Miriam the sister of Aaron, and Deborah, who were distinguished by that title, not only because they pronounced the oracles of Jehovah, but on account of their excellence in music and poetry; for these sister arts were united by the Hebrews, as well as by all other nations, during the first stages of society. After these proofs there can scarcely be any occasion to remark, that Solomon, or at least the editor or compiler of his proverbs, twice makes use of the word, which, in its ordinary sense, means prophecy, strictly so called, to denote the language of poetry. For he calls the words of Agur and Lemuel  332 Massa 333 , which Jerome renders vision , the seventy Greek translators an oracle , the Chaldee prophecy : when in reality those passages have nothing in them which can be properly said to bear any resemblance to prophecy; but are mere rhapsodies of morality, ornamented indeed with the usual embellishments of poetry  334 . The Hebrews certainly did not express by the same word ideas, which they deemed inconsistent, or repugnant to each other; and, what is remarkable, the same ambiguity prevails, the same word (and we may well presume for similar reasons) denotes both a Prophet and a Poet in the Arabic language, in the Greek, and in the Latin  335 . Nor is it reasonable to suppose, that Prophecy admitted Poetry and Music to a participation in the name alone; on the contrary we find, that she did not disdain to unite herself with Harmony, and to accept of her assistance. The example of Elisha is remarkable  336 , who, when about to pronounce the answer of the Most High to the inquiry of the two kings of Israel and Judah, orders a minstrel to be brought to him, and upon his striking the harp, is immediately agitated by the Holy Spirit  337 . Many commentators have indeed supposed that the Prophet applied to music only to sooth the perturbation of his mind; in this they follow an opinion of some of the more modern Rabbies (an opinion, it may be observed, by no means satisfactorily proved) that every emotion of a more vehement kind excluded the Holy Spirit, and consequently was totally inconsistent with prophecy  338 ; when, on the contrary, we learn from the testimony of the Prophets themselves, that the act of prophesying was often, if not always, accompanied with a very violent agitation of the mind  339 . Be this as it may, I am inclined to believe, both from this last and the other instances, that the Prophet himself accompanied the minstrel, and uttered some hymn, or rather the prediction itself, to the music of the harp; and both the style and the form of this prophetic reply are very much in favour of this opinion  340 From all these testimonies it is sufficiently evident, that the prophetic office had a most strict connexion with the poetic art. They had one common name, one common origin, one common author, the Holy Spirit. Those in particular were called to the exercise of the prophetic office, who were previously conversant with the sacred poetry. It was equally a part of their duty to compose verses for the service of the church, and to declare the oracles of God: it cannot, therefore, be doubted that a great portion of the sacred hymns may properly be termed prophecies, or that many of the prophecies are in reality hymns or poems. Since, as we have already proved, it was from the first a principal end and aim of poetry, to impress upon the minds of men the sayings of the wise, and such precepts as related either to the principles of faith, or the laws of morality, as well as to transmit the same to posterity; it ought not to appear extraordinary, that prophecy, which in this view ranks as a principal, and is of the highest importance, should not disdain the assistance of an art so admirably calculated to effect its purposes. Of this we have an illustrious proof in that prophetic ode of Moses  341 , which he composed by the especial command of God, to be learned by the Israelites, and committed to memory: "That this song may be," says God himself, "for a witness against the people of Israel, when they shall depart from me; this shall be a testimony in their mouths; for it shall not be forgotten, nor shall it depart out of the mouths of their posterity for ever 342 ". But, as on the one hand, this poem of Moses is a clear and remarkable specimen of the prophetic mode of writing; so, on the other, there are many prophecies which are not less conspicuous as poems. It remains, therefore, only to produce a few examples from the prophetic writings. Many of the most ancient of those, which are extant in the Mosaic history, I have already quoted  343 , as exhibiting the fairest examples of the Hebrew poetry: for instance, the imprecation of Noah, the blessing of Jacob, and the predictions of Balaam: than all which (and particularly those of Balaam) I do not know that the whole extent of the prophetic writings could afford more pertinent instances. Nay, so eminently distinguished are they by all the characteristics of poetry, that those who are inclined to acknowledge any kind of metre in the Hebrew poetry, must, I am convinced, refer to these as metrical, compositions, if they be in the least desirous of maintaining their opinion by fact and argument. Among the prophecies of Balaam I will also venture to class that most elegant poem, which is rescued from oblivion by the prophet Micah  344 , and which in matter and diction, in the structure, form, and character of the composition, so admirably agrees with the other monuments of his fame, that it evidently appears to be a citation from the answer of Balaam to the king of the Moabites  345 : "Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah ? "Wherewith shall I bow myself unto the High God? "Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings; "With calves of a year old? "Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams? "With ten thousands of rivers of oil? "Shall I give my first-born for my transgression? "The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? "He hath shewed, thee, O man, what is good: "And what doth Jehovah require of thee, "But to do justice, and to love mercy, "And to be humble in walking with thy God?" But if we proceed to other parts of the Sacred History, examples will not be wanting: and among the first of these is that Cygnean song of Moses, as it may properly be called; I do not speak of the prophetic ode, which has frequently been distinguished by that title, but of the last blessing of that divine Prophet, in which are predicted the future fortunes of the Israelites: " Jehovah came from Sinai: "And rose up unto them from Seir:"---  346 The prophecy is evidently of the same nature with that of Jacob; both in the exordium and the conclusion it is exquisitely sublime; and throughout the whole affords an admirable specimen of the prophetic poetry. In the same class with these may be ranked the answer of Samuel the prophet to Saul, in which he reproaches him with his disobedience and contumacy, and denounces against him the Divine decree of expulsion from his kingdom, it consists of four distichs elegantly corresponding to each other. "Hath Jehovah pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, "As in listening to the voice of Jehovah ? "Behold! to listen is better than sacrifice, "And to obey than the fat of rams. "Rebellion is as the sin of divination, "And contempt as the crime of idolatry. "Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah , "He hath also rejected thee from being king  347 ." The last words of David  348 afford an evident and illustrious instance to the same purpose, however difficult and obscure the verbal interpretation of the prophecy may be. I apprehend the examples from Sacred History will appear sufficiently numerous, if I add the prediction of Isaiah concerning Senacherib, which is inserted in the book of Kings: "He hath despised thee, he hath mocked, thee, O virgin daughter of Sion; He hath shaken his head at thee, O daughter of Jerusalem  349 ." The same passage occurs again among the predictions of the Prophet: and this reminds me that it is now full time to pass from the historians to the books of the prophets themselves, which will afford us abundant instances to demonstrate that the compositions of the prophets are truly poetical, and at the same time to illustrate the nature of their poetry. The psalmody of the Hebrews.---The manner of chanting the hymns by alternate choirs: whence the origin of the poetical construction of the sentences, and that peculiar form, in which verses and distichs run parallel or correspondent to each other.---Three species of parallelism; the synonymous, the antithetic, and the synthetic: examples of each, first from the books generally allowed to be poetical, and afterwards from the writings of the prophets.---The sentiments of R. Azarias considered.---The great importance of an accurate attention to this poetical conformation of the sentences . THE origin and earliest application of the Hebrew poetry have, I think, been clearly traced into the service of religion. To celebrate in hymns and songs the praises of Almighty God; to decorate the worship of the Most High with all the charms and graces of harmony; to give force and energy to the devout affections was the sublime employment of the Sacred Muse. It is more than probable, that the very early use of sacred music in the public worship of the Hebrews, contributed not a little to the peculiar character of their poetry, and might impart to it that appropriate form, which, though chiefly adapted to this particular purpose, it nevertheless preserves on every other occasion. But in order to explain this matter more clearly, it will be necessary to premise a few observations concerning the ancient Hebrew mode of chanting their sacred hymns. Though we are rather at a loss for information, respecting the usual manner and ceremony of chanting their poems; and though the subject of their sacred music in general be involved in doubt and obscurity, thus far at least is evident from many examples, that the sacred hymns were alternately sung by opposite choirs  350 , and that the one choir usually performed the hymn itself, while the other sung a particular distich, which was regularly interposed at stated intervals, either of the nature of the proasm or epode of the Greeks. In this manner we learn that Moses with the Israelites chanted the ode at the Red-sea; for "Miriam the prophetess took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her with timbrels, and with dances; and Miriam answered them," that is, she and the women sung the response to the chorus of men  351 ; "Sing to Jehovah , for he is greatly exalted; "The horse and the rider he hath cast into the sea." The same is observable in some of the Psalms, which are composed in this form. The musical performance was on some occasions differently conducted: for instance, one of the choirs sung a single verse to the other, while the other constantly added a verse in some respect correspondent to the former. Of this the following distich is an example, "Sing praises to Jehovah , for he is good; "Because his mercy endureth for ever:" which Ezra  352 informs us was sung by the Priests and Levites in alternate choirs at the command of David; as indeed may be collected from the Psalm itself  353 , in which the latter verse, sung by the latter choir, forms a perpetual epode. Of the same nature is the song of the women concerning Saul and David  354 , for "the women who played answered one another;" that is, they chanted in two choirs the alternate song  355 , the one choir singing, "Saul hath smote his thousands," The other answering, "And David his ten thousands." In the very same manner Isaiah describes the Seraphim chanting the praise of Jehovah  356 : "they cried alternately, "Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah God of Hosts! "The whole earth is filled with his glory." From the Jewish, the custom of singing in alternate chorus was transmitted to the Christian Church, and was continued in the latter from the first ages, it was called "alternate or responsive  357 ," when the whole choir separated into two divisions sung the Psalm alternately by strophes; and when this was done by single verses, or lines, that is when the same division of the choir always sung the latter part of the distich, they were said to sing the choral response  358 . Now if this were the ancient and primitive mode of chanting their hymns, as indeed appears highly probable, the proximate cause will be easily explained, why poems of this kind are disposed in equal stanzas, indeed in equal distichs, for the most part; and why these distichs should in some measure consist of versicles or parallelisms  359 corresponding to each other. And this mode of composition being admirably adapted to the musical modulation of that kind of poetry, which was most in use among them from the very beginning, and at the same time being perfectly agreeable to the genius and cadence of the language, easily extended itself into the other species of poetry, though not designed for the same purpose; in fact, we find that it pervaded the whole of the poetry of the Hebrews; insomuch, that what was said of the Heathen Muses may still more strictly be applied to those of the Hebrews,---"they love alternate song." On this occasion also it may not be improper to remark, that the word gnanah , which properly signifies to answer, is used more generally to denote any song or poem  360 ; whence we can only infer, either that the word has passed from particular to general use, or that among the Hebrews almost every poem possesses a sort of responsive form. Such appears to have been the origin and progress of that poetical and artificial conformation of the sentences, which we observe in the poetry of the Hebrews. That it prevailed no less in the Prophetic Poetry than in the Lyric and Didactic, to which it was, in the nature of things, most adapted, is evident from those very ancient specimens of poetical prophecy already quoted from the historical books; and it only remains to shew, that it is no less observable in those which are contained in the volumes of the prophets themselves. In order the more clearly to evince this point, I shall endeavour to illustrate the Hebrew parallelism according to its different species, first by examples taken from those books commonly allowed to be poetical, and afterwards by correspondent examples from the books of the prophets. The poetical conformation of the sentences, which has been so often alluded to as characteristic of the Hebrew poetry, consists chiefly in a certain equality, resemblance, or parallelism between the members of each period; so that in two lines (or members of the same period) things for the most part shall answer to things, and words to words, as if fitted to each other by a kind of rule or measure. This parallelism has much variety and many gradations; it is sometimes more accurate and manifest, sometimes more vague and obscure: it may however, on the whole, be said to consist of three species. The first species is the synonymous parallelism, when the same sentiment is repeated in different, but equivalent terms. This is the most frequent of all, and is often conducted with the utmost accuracy and neatness: examples are very numerous, nor will there be any great difficulty in the choice of them: on this account I shall select such as are most remarkable in other respects. "When Israel went out from Egypt; "The house of Jacob from a strange people: "Judah was as his sacred heritage: "Israel his dominion. "The sea saw, and fled; "Jordan turned back: "The mountains leaped like rams; "The hills like the sons of the flock. "What ailed thee, O Sea, that thou fleddest; "Jordan, that thou turnedst back: "Mountains, that ye leaped like rams; "And hills, like the sons of the flock? "At the presence of the Lord tremble thou Earth; "At the presence of the God of Jacob! "Who turned the rock into a lake of waters; "The flint into a water spring  361 ." The Prophetic Muse is no less elegant and correct: "Arise, be thou enlightened; for thy light is come; "And the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee. "For behold darkness shall cover the earth; "And a thick vapour the nations; "But upon thee shall Jehovah arise; "And his glory upon thee shall be conspicuous. "And the nations shall walk in thy light; "And kings in the brightness of thy rising  362 ." Observe also that famous prophecy concerning the humiliation, and expiatory sufferings of the Messiah: "Who hath believed our report; "And to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been manifested: "For he groweth up in their sight like a tender sucker; "And like a root from a thirsty soil; "He hath no form, nor any beauty that we should regard him; "Nor is his countenance such, that we should desire him. "Despised, nor accounted in the number of men; "A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; "As one that hideth his face from us: "He was despised, and we esteemed him not. "Surely our infirmities he hath borne. "And our sorrows he  363 hath carried them.--- "Yet we thought him judicially stricken; "Smitten of God and afflicted. "But he was wounded for our transgressions; "Was smitten for our iniquities: "The chastisement by which our peace was effected was laid upon him; "And by his bruises we are healed  364 ." Isaiah is indeed excellent, but not unrivalled in this kind of composition: there are abundant examples in the other prophets; I shall, however, only add one from Hosea, which is exquisitely pathetic. "How shall I resign thee, O Ephraim! "How shall I deliver thee up, O Israel! "How shall I resign thee as Admah! "How shall I make thee as Zeboim! "My heart is changed within me; "I am warmed also with repentance towards thee. "I will not do according to the fervour of my wrath, "I will not return  365 to destroy Ephraim: "For I am God, and not man; "Holy in the midst of thee, though I inhabit not thy cities  366 ." There is great variety in the form of the synonymous parallelism, some instances of which are deserving of remark. The parallelism is sometimes formed by the iteration of the former member, either in the whole or in part: "Much have they oppressed me from my youth up, "May Israel now say; "Much have they oppressed me from my youth,  367 "Yet have they not prevailed against me  368 ." "God of vengeance, Jehovah ; "God of vengeance, shew thyself. "How long shall the wicked, O Jehovah , "How long shall the wicked triump  369 !" "With the jaw-bone of an ass, heaps upon heaps; "With the jaw-bone of an ass a thousand men have I smitten  370 ." Thus, Isaiah: "Because in the night Ar is destroyed, Moab is undone! "Because in the night Kir is destroyed, Moab is undone.  371 ." So Nahum also in the exordium of his sublime prophecy: " Jehovah is a jealous and avenging God: " Jehovah avengeth, and is wrathful: " Jehovah avengeth his adversaries; "And he reserveth indignation for his enemies  372 ." There is frequently something wanting in the latter member, which must be repeated from the former to complete the sentence: "The kind sent and released him; "The ruler of the people, and set him free  373 ." In the same manner Isaiah: "Kings shall see him and shall rise up; "Princes, and they shall worship him: "For the sake of Jehovah , who is faithful; "Of the Holly One of Israel, for he hath chosen thee  374 ." Frequently the whole of the latter division answers only to some part of the former: " Jehovah reigneth, let the earth rejoice; "Let the multitude of islands be glad  375 ." "Arise, be thou enlightened; for thy light is come; "And the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee  376 ." Sometimes also there are triplet parallelisms. In these the second line is generally synonymous with the first, whilst the third either begins the period, or concludes it, and frequently refers to both the preceding: "The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah , "The floods have lifted up their voice; "The floods have lifted up their waves. "Than the voice of many waters, "The glorious waves of the sea, " Jehovah on high is more glorious.  377 ." "Come and let us return unto Jehovah ; "For he hath torn, and he will heal us; "He hath smitten, and he will bind us up: "After two days he will revive us; "On the third day he will raise us up; "And we shall live in his sight  378 ." In stanzas (if I may so call them) of five lines, the nature of which is nearly similar, the line that is not parallel is generally placed between the two distichs: "Like as the lion growleth, "Even the young lion over his prey; "Though the whole company of shepherds be called together against him: "At their voice he will not be terrified, "Nor at their tumulut will he be humbled  379 ." "Askalon shall see it, and shall fear; "Gaza shall also see it, and shall be greatly pained: "And Ekron shall be pained, because her expectation is put to shame; "And the king shall perish from Gaza; "And Askalon shall not be inhabited  380 ." Those which consist of four lines generally form two regular distichs; but there is sometimes a peculiar artifice to be perceived in the distribution of the sentences: "From the Heavens Jehovah looketh down, "He seeth all the children of men; "From the seat of his rest he contemplateth "All the inhabitants of the earth  381 ." "I will drench my arrows in blood, "And my sword shall devour flesh; "In the blood of the slain and the captives; "From the bushy head of the enemies  382 ." In both the above passages, the latter members are to be alternately referred to the former. Isaiah too uses with great elegance this form of composition: "For thy husband is thy maker; " Jehovah God of Hosts is his name: "And thy redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; "The God of the whole earth shall he be "called  383 ." The sense has an alternate correspondence in these lines. In the following the form of the construction is alternate: "And his land is filled with silver and gold; "And there is no end to his treasures; "And his land is filled with horses, "Neither is there any end to his chariots  384 ." The following is perhaps a singular instance; "Who is like unto Jehovah our God? "Who is exalted to dwell on high, "Who humbleth himself to look down, "In the heavens, and in the earth  385 ." Here the two members of the latter line are to be referred severally to the two preceding lines; as if it were: "Who is exalted to dwell in the heavens, and who humbleth himself to inspect the things that are in the earth." The Antithetic parallelism is the next that I shall specify, when a thing is illustrated by its contrary being opposed to it. This is not confined to any particular form: for sentiments are opposed to sentiments, words to words, singulars to singulars, plurals to plurals, &c. of which the following are examples: "The blows of a friend are faithful; "But the kisses of an enemy are treacherous  386 . "The cloyed will trample upon an honey-comb; "But to the hungry every bitter thing is sweet. "There is who maketh himself rich, and wanteth all things; "Who maketh himself poor, yet hath much wealth. "The rich man is wise in his own eyes, "But the poor man that hath discernment to trace him out will despite him  387 ." There is sometimes a contraposition of parts in the same sentence, such as occurs once in the above; and as appears in the following: "I am swarthy but comely, O daughters of Jerusalem; "As the tents of Kedar, as the pavilions of Solomon  388 ." The last line here is also to be divided and separately applied to the preceding, "swarthy as the tents of Kedar; comely as the pavilions of Solomon," so likewise in the enigma of Sampson: "Out of the eater came forth meat; "And out of the strong came forth sweetness  389 ." This form of composition, indeed, agrees best with adages and acute sayings: it is therefore very prevalent in the proverbs of Solomon, in some of which the principal force and elegance depend on the exactness of the antithesis. It is not however inconsistent with the superior kinds of Hebrew poetry; for we meet with it in the thanksgiving ode of Hannah, which is imitated in this particular, as well as in the general form of its composition in that of the Virgin Mary: "The bows of the mighty are broken; "And they that stumbled are girded with strength: "The full have hired themselves for bread; "And the hungry have ceased to  390 hunger: "The barren also hath borne seven; "And she who had many children is become fruitless. " Jehovah killeth and maketh alive; "He casteth down to hell, and lifteth up. " Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich; "Depresseth, and also exalteth  391 ." The sublimer poetry seldom indeed adopts this style. Isaiah, however, by means of it, without departing from his usual dignity, adds greatly to the sweetness of his composition in the following instances: "In a little anger have I forsaken thee; But with great mercies will I receive thee again: In a short wrath I hid my face for a moment from thee; But with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee  392 ." Behold my servants shall eat, but ye shall be famished; Behold my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; Behold my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be confounded; Behold my servants shall sing aloud, for gladness of heart; But ye shall cry aloud for gried of heart; And in the anguish of a broken spirit shall ye howl  393 ." There is a third species of parallelism, in which the sentences answer to each other, not by the iteration of the same image or sentiment, or the opposition of their contraries, but merely by the form of construction. To this, which may be called the Synthetic or Constructive Parallelism, may be referred all such as do not come within the two former classes: I shall however produce a few of the most remarkable instances: "The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple: The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of Jehovah is clear, enlightening the eyes: The fear of Jehovah is pure, enduring for ever; The judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are just altogether. More desirable than gold, or than much fine gold; And sweeter than honey, or the dropping of "honey-combs  394 ." This kind of parallelism generally consists of verses somewhat longer than usual, of which there are not wanting examples in the prophets: "How hath the oppressor ceased! the exactress of gold ceased! He that smote the people in wrath with a stroke unremitted; He that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted, and none hindereth. The whole earth is at rest, is quiet; they burst forth into a joyful shout; Even the fir-trees rejoice over thee, the cedars of Lebanon: Since thou art fallen, no feller hath come up against us. Hades from beneath is moved because of thee, to meet thee at thy coming: He rouseth for thee the mighty dead, all the great chiefs of the earth; He maketh to rise up from their thrones all the kings of the nations  395 ." Triplets are frequently formed of this kind of parallelism: "The clouds overflowed with water; The atmosphere resounded; Thine arrows also issued forth; The voice of thy thunder was in the skies; The lightnings enlightened the world; The earth trembled and shook  396 ." I will be as the dew to Israel: He shall blossom as the lily; And he shall strike his roots like Lebanon, His suckers shall spread, And his glory shall be as the olive-tree, And his smell as Lebanon  397 ." Frequently one line or member contains two sentiments: "The nations raged; the kingdoms were moved; He uttered a voice; the earth was dissolved: Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted in the nations, I will be exalted in the earth  398 ." "When thou passest through waters I am with thee; And through rivers, they shall not overwhelm thee: When thou walkest in the fire thou shalt not be scorched; And the flame shall not cleave to thee  399 ." There is a peculiar figure which is frequently made use of in this species of parallelism, and which seems altogether poetical: that is, when a definite number is put for an indefinite, principally, it should seem, for the sake of the parallelism: for it sometimes happens, that the circumstances afterwards enumerated do not accurately accord with the number specified: "In six troubles will he deliver thee; And in seven there shall no evil touch thee  400 ." "God hath said once; Twice also have I heard the same  401 ." That frequently-repeated passage of Amos is well-known: "For three transgressions of Damascus, And for four, I will not restore it  402 ." The variety in the form of this synthetic parallelism is very great, and the degrees of resemblance almost infinte: so that sometimes the scheme of the parallelism is very subtile and obscure, and must be developed by art and ability in distinguishing the different members of the sentences, and in distributing the points, rather than by depending upon the obvious construction. How much this principle pervades the Hebrew poetry, and how difficulty of explication it is, may in some degree be illustrated by one example. This appears to consist of a single line, if the sentiment only be considered: "I also have anointed my King on Sion, the mountain of my sanctity  403 ." But the general form and nature of the Psalm requires that it should be divided into two parts or versicles; as if it were, "I also have anointed my king; I have anointed him in Sion, the mountain of my sanctity." Which indeed the Masorites seem to have perceived in this as well as in other places  404 . In this peculiar conformation, or parallelism of the sentences, I apprehend a considerable part of the Hebrew metre to consist; though it is not improbable that some regard was also paid to the numbers and feet. But of this particular we have at present so little information, that it is utterly impossible to determine, whether it were modulated by the ear alone, or according to any settled or definite rules of prosody. Since however this, and other marks of vestiges, as it were, of the metrical art are alike extant in the writings of the prophets, and in the books which are commonly allowed to be poetical, I think there is sufficient reason to rank them in the same class. Lest I should seem to have attributed too much to this conformation of the sentences, and to have rashly embraced an opinion not supported by sufficient authority, I shall beg leaves to quote to you the opinion of Azarias, a Jew Rabbi, not indeed a very ancient, but a very approved author  405 . "Without doubt," says he, "the sacred songs have certain measures and proportions, but these do not consist in the number of the syllables perfect or imperfect, according to the form of the modern verse; but in the number of things, and of the parts of things; that is, the subject and the predicate, and their adjuncts, in every sentence and proposition." (Which words of Azarias are, however, to be understood with some limitation; nor are they to be literally interpreted according to their sense in logical treatises, for he proceeds,) "Thus a phrase, containing two parts of a proposition, consists of two measures: add another containing four, and they become four measures: another again containing three parts of a proposition, consists of three measures; add to it another of the like, and you have six measures: for you are not to number the words or syllables but the sentences." For instance, "Thy right hand O Jehovah ," according to Azarias, consists of two terms, or parts of a proposition; to which is connected, "is all glorious in power," consisting likewise of two terms; these joined together make a Tetrameter. The following is constructed on a similar principle: "Thy right-hand, O Jehovah , hath crushed the enemy  406 ." Thus in the following propositions there are three terms or measures, "My-doctrine shall-drop, as-the-rain; my-word shall-distil, as-the-dew  407 ." "And thus joined together they form an Hexameter." In fact, what he has here remarked is neither groundless nor altogether just. For with respect to many passages, in which the distribution of the sentences is very unequal, and in which the propositions have but little correspondence with each other, as happens frequently in the Psalms, we must have recourse to some other solution; and when the sentences are most regular and correct, they cannot at all times be reduced to his rules. But although the present question does not depend upon this single point, no man, I think, who reads with attention the poetic books, and especially what may be properly called the prophetic part of them, will entertain a doubt that it is of the utmost importance to distinguish the system of the verses. But should all that has been remarked concerning the members and divisions of the sentences appear light and trifling to some persons, and utterly undeserving any labour or attention; let them remember that nothing can be of greater avail to the proper understanding of any writer, than a previous acquaintance with both his general character, and the peculiarities of his style and manner of writing; let them recollect that translators and commentators have fallen into errors upon no account more frequently, than for want of attention to this article; and indeed, I scarcely know any subject which promises more copiously to reward the labour of such as are studies of sacred criticism, than this one in particular  408 . The whole of the book of Daniel, as well as of Jonah, are to be excepted as not poetical, though of the prophetic kind; also certain historical relations inserted in the books of the Prophets.---Some poems occur in the prophetic writings, which properly belong to the other classes of poetry.---The remainder constitutes what may be termed a system or code of prophetic poetry. ---The character of this species of Poetry deduced from the nature and design of Prophecy itself.--- An example of the true style of prophetic poetry produced from Isaiah, and explained: also another from the prophecies of Balaam, translated into English verse . IN the two last Lectures I endeavoured to explain upon what reasons I was induced to class the predictions of the prophets among the poetical productions of the Hebrews. I speak not of all, but the greater part of the prophetic writings: for there are among them parts which are not prophetic, and even among those which are, there are some passages not poetical. I except, in the first place, those narrations plainly historical, relating to the facts which gave occasion to the prophecies, and which serve to introduce, to explain, and illustrate them: some of this kind occur in Isaiah, and in Jeremiah many more. The whole of what is called the prophecy of Jonah is the bare recital of a fact, and contains nothing of poetry but the prayer of the prophet, which is an ode. Some of the prophecies themselves must also be excepted, which are indeed sublime and important as to the matter, but not at all poetical as to the style and metrical structure: of this kind many passages occur in Ezekiel; who frequently appears more of the orator than the poet. The whole book of Daniel too, being no more than a plain relation of facts partly past and partly future, must be excluded the class of poetical prophecy. Much I confess of the parabolic imagery is introduced in that book, but the author introduces it as a prophet only; as visionary and allegorical symbols of objects and events, totally untinctured with the true poetical colouring. The Jews, indeed, would refuse to Daniel even the character of a prophet, but the arguments under which they shelter this opinion are very futile: for those points which they maintain, concerning the conditions on which the gift of prophecy is imparted; the different gradations, and the discrimination between the true prophecy and mere inspiration; are all trifling and absurd, without any foundation in the nature of things, and totally destitute of scriptural authority  409 They add, that Daniel was neither originally educated in the prophetic discipline and precepts, nor afterwards lived conformably to the manner of the prophets. I do not, however, comprehend how this can diminish his claim to a divine mission and inspiration; it may possibly enable us, indeed, to assign a reason for the dissimilarity between the style of Daniel and that of the other Prophets, and for its possessing so little of the diction and character of poetry, which the rest seem to have imbibed in common from the schools and discipline in which they were educated 410 . There occur, moreover, in the writings of the Prophets, certain passages, which although poetical, yet do not properly belong to this species of poetry. I allude to some instances in Isaiah, Habbakuk, and Ezekiel, which appear to constitute complete poems of different kinds, Odes as well as Elegies. These also being excepted, all the other predictions of the prophets (including such as are extant in the historical books, most of which have been occasionally quoted in the course of these Lectures, form a whole, and constitute that particular species of poetry, which I distinguish by the appellation of prophetic. I shall now endeavour, in the first place, to offer to your consideration such a description of this species of poetry, as may serve to distinguish it from the rest; and afterwards to delineate the peculiar character of each of the prophets, as far as may be consistent with the object of these Lectures. The genius of the prophetic poetry is to be explored by a due attention to the nature and design of prophecy itself. The immediate design of all prophecy is to inform or amend those generations that precede the events predicted, and it is usually calculated either to excite their fears and apprehensions, or to afford them consolation. The means which it employs for the accomplishment of these effects, are a general amplification of the subject, whether it be of the menacing or consolatory kind, copious descriptions, diversified, pompous and sublime; in this also it necessarily avoids too great a degree of exactness, and too formal a display of the minuter circumstances; rather employing a vague and general style of description, expressive only of the nature and magnitude of the subject: for prophecy in its very nature implies some degree of obscurity, and is always, as the Apostle elegantly expresses it, "like a light glimmering in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day- star arise  411 ." But there is also a further use and intention of prophecy, which regards those who live after the prediction is accomplished, and that is, the demonstration and attestation which it affords of the divine veracity: this evidently appears to demand a different form of enunciation; for correct language, apt imagery, and an exact display of circumstances, are peculiarly adapted to this purpose. Since, however, a very plain description would totally withdraw the veil of obscurity, a more sparing use of this liberty of particularizing is frequently adequate to that purpose; for the particular notification of one or two circumstances, united with a general propriety in the imagery, the proper adaptation of which shall appear after the event, will afford an accumulation of evidence that cannot be withstood, as might be demonstrated in a number of instances  412 . The prophetic style, therefore, is chiefly constructed on the former principle; that is, it commonly prefers a general mode of amplifying and elevating the subject, rarely and cautiously descending to a circumstantial detail. There is also another particular, which must not be omitted. Prophecy frequently takes in, at a single glance, a variety of events, distinct both in nature and time, and pursues the extreme and principal design through all its different gradations. From this cause also it principally employs general ideas, and expresses them by imagery of established use and acceptation, for these are equally capable of comprehending the general scope of the divine counsels, and of accompanying the particular progressions of circumstances, situations, and events; they may be easily applied to the intermediate relations and ends, but must be more accurately weighed and proportioned to equal the magnitude and importance of the ultimate design. If such be the genius of prophecy; if it be chiefly employed in describing only the exterior lineaments of events, and in depicting and embellishing general effects; it will not be difficult to understand with how much advantage it may make use of the assistance and ministration of poetry, and in particular of the parabolic style; the nature of which, as I have already copiously stated, is to afford an abundance and variety of imagery of established use and acceptation, from which every subject may receive the most ample and the most proper embellishments. Hence too we may easily collect the peculiar character of the prophetic poetry. This species of poetry is more ornamented, more splendid, and more florid than any other. It abounds more in imagery, at least in that species of imagery which, in the parabolic style, is of common and established acceptation, and which, by means of a settled analogy always preserved, is transferred from certain and definite objects to express indefinite and general ideas. Of all the images proper to the parabolic style, it most frequently introduces those which are taken from natural objects and from sacred history: it abounds most in metaphors, allegories, comparisons, and even in copious and diffuse descriptions. It possesses all that genuine enthusiasm, which is the natural attendant on inspiration; it excels in the brightness of imagination and in clearness and energy of diction, and consequently rises to an uncommon pitch of sublimity: hence also it often is very happy in the expression and delineation of the passions, though more commonly employed in the exciting of them; this indeed is its immediate object, over this it presides as its peculiar province. In respect to the order, disposition, and symmetry of a perfect poem of the prophetic kind, I do not know of any certain definition, which will admit of general application. Naturally free, and of too ardent a spirit to be confined by rule, it is usually guided by the nature of the subject only, and the impulse of divine inspiration. There are not wanting, it is true, instances of great elegance and perfection in these particulars. Among the shorter prophecies, I need only mention those of Balaam, each of which is possessed of a certain accuracy of arrangement and symmetry of form; they open with an elegant exordium, they proceed with a methodical continuation of the subject, and are wound up with a full and graceful conclusion. There are many similar instances in the books of the Prophets, and particularly in Isaiah, which deserve the highest commendation, and may with propriety be classed with the most perfect and regular specimens of poetry. I shall select for your consideration one example from that most accomplished writer, which is embellished with all the most striking ornaments of poetry: from this instance I shall not only demonstrate with what accuracy the prophetic Muse sometimes preserves the proper order and arrangement of the parts and circumstances; but I shall be enabled, at the same time, to illustrate most of those positions, which I have now laid down, concerning the nature and genius of the prophetic poetry. Such an illustration will probably be not unnecessary; since it is to be apprehended, that what has been remarked only in general terms upon so subtile and difficult a subject, may, without the aid of example, appear not a little perplexed and obscure. The thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth chapters of Isaiah contain a remarkable prophecy. It is a simple, regular, and perfect poem, consisting of two parts according to the nature of the subject, which, as to its general properties, is explained with the utmost perspicuity. The first part of the prophecy contains a denunciation of extraordinary punishment, indeed nothing short of total destruction against the enemies of the church of God; and afterwards, in consequence of this event, a full and complete restoration is promised to the church itself. The Prophet introduces the subject by a magnificent exordium, invoking universal nature to the observation of these events, in which the whole world should seem to be interested: "Draw near, O ye nations, and hearken; And attend unto me, O ye people! Let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; The world, and all that spring from it  413 ." He then publishes the decree of Jehovah concerning the extirpation of all those nations against whom "his wrath is kindled:" and he amplifies this act of vengeance and destruction by an admirable selection of splendid imagery, all of which is of the same kind with that which is made use of by the prophets upon similar occasions; the nature of which is to exaggerate the force, the magnitude, atrocity and importance of the impending visitation; whilst nothing determinate is specified concerning the manner, the time, the place, or other minute circumstances. He first exhibits that truly martial picture of slaughter and destruction after a victory: "And their slain shall be cast out; And from their carcasses their stench shall ascend; And the mountains shall melt down with their blood  414 ." He then takes a bolder flight, and illustrates his description by imagery borrowed from the Mosaic chaos (which is a common source of figurative language on these occasions, and is appropriated to the expression of the downfal of nations); and, as if he were displaying the total subversion of the universe itself: "And all the host of heaven shall waste away; And the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll: And all their host shall wither; As the withered leaf droppeth from the vine, And as the blighted fruit from the fig tree  415 ." A different image is immediately introduced; a solemn sacrifice is celebrated, and an uncommon number of victims are displayed: Jehovah himself takes a part in this magnificent scene, and every circumstance is brought directly before our eyes: "For my sword is made bare in the heavens; Behold, on Edom it shall descend; And on the people justly by me devoted to destruction. The sword of Jehovah is satiated with blood; It is pampered with fat: With the blood of lambs, and of goats; With the fat of the reins of rams; For Jehovah celebrateth a sacrifice in Botzra, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom  416 ," The goats, the rams, the bulls, the flocks, and other animals, which are mentioned in this passage and those which follow, are commonly used by the prophets to denote the haughty, ferocious, and insolent tyrants and chiefs of those nations, which were inimical to God. On the same principle we may explain the allusion to Botzra and Idumea, a city and nation in the highest degree obnoxious to the people of God. These, however, the prophecy seems only slightly or cursorily to glance at: the phraseology is indeed of that kind which expresses generals by particulars; or consists, as I formerly remarked, of a figure taken from a determinate and definite object, and by analogy applied in a more extensive sense; in which respect the very words which are made use of have in this place a peculiar form and propriety  417 . But the same circumstance is again described by a succession of new and splendid images borrowed from the overthrow of Sodom, which, as was formerly demonstrated, may be termed one of the common-places of the inspired Poets: "For it is the day of vengeance to Jehovah ; The year of recompense to the defender of the cause of Sion. And her torrents shall be turned into pitch, And her dust into sulphur; And her whole land shall become burning pitch: By night or by day it shall not be extinguished; For ever shall her smoke ascend: From generation to generation she shall lie desert; To everlasting ages no one shall pass through her  418 ." Lastly, the same event is prefigured under the image of a vast and solitary desert, to which, according to the divine decree, that region is devoted  419 . This description the prophet afterwards improves, diversifies, and enlarges, by the addition of several important circumstances, all which, however, have a certain analogy or connexion with each other. The other part of the poem is constructed upon similar principles, and exhibits a beautiful contrast to the preceding scene. The imagery possesses every possible advantage of ornament and variety; it is like the former, altogether of a general kind, and of extensive application; but the meaning is plain and perspicuous. Many of the preceding images are taken from the Sacred History; the following are almost entirely from the objects of nature: "The desert and the waste, shall be glad; And the wilderness shall rejoice and flourish: Like the rose shall it beautifully flourish; And the well-watered plain of Jordan shall also rejoice: And the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, The beauty of Carmel and of Sharon; These shall behold the glory of Jehovah , The Majesty of our God  420 ." I formerly remarked the extensive application of Lebanon and Carmel in a figurative sense  421 , and that they are sometimes expressive even of the divine glory and Majesty 422 . The cultivation and watering of a barren and rocky soil is so frequently, I might say invariably, in the parabolic style employed to denote the divine grace and spiritual endowments, that there is no necessity for any further explanation of this symbol; nor is the succeeding imagery, which, according to a similar analogy, seems to illustrate the same event, less clear and perspicuous. To him who attentively reads and considers the whole poem, the order and arrangement of the subject will be more fully apparent. The passages which I have noted will, however, I apprehend, be sufficient to demonstrate the species of imagery, the style, and colours most congenial to the prophetic Muse; they will also, I flatter myself, be sufficient in some measure to explain the manner in which she contrives to display, in the strongest colours, the general nature, magnitude, and importance of events; and at the same time to leave the particular situations, the intermediate gradations, and all the minuter circumstances concealed under the bold and prominent features of the description, till the accomplishment of the prediction. There are indeed one or two passages in this prophecy which would serve to illustrate this position  423 ; in the rest, the circumstances and progress of the particular events are not yet unsolded; for this prophecy is evidently one of those which are not yet completely fulfilled, and of which the greater part at least is yet deposited in the secret counsels of the Most High. That I may not however conclude this lecture without exhibiting the form of some prophetic poem complete in all parts, I have selected for this purpose one of the prophecies of Balaam, which I so lately mentioned, and which in the course of these lectures have more than once deservedly attracted our attention: for indeed I do not know that the whole scope of the Hebrew poetry contains any thing more exquisite or perfect. This, which is at present under our consideration, abounds in gay and splendid imagery copied immediately from the tablet of Nature; and is chiefly conspicuous for the glowing elegance of the style, and the glowing elegance of the style, and the form and diversity of the figures. Though every attempt to display the beauties of the Hebrew imagery in the poetry of another language must fall greatly short of the design, it will yet give a little variety to our studies, to intersperse them occasionally with modern verse. On these occasions, as indeed on every other, I must rely upon the candour of this audience to accept in good part the willing tribute of my faint endeavours  424 . In proud array thy tents expand, O Israel, o'er the subject land: As the broad vales in prospect rise, As gardens by the waters spread, As cedars of majestic size, That shade the sacred fountain's head. Thy torrents shall the earth o'erflow, O'erwhelming each obdurate foe. In vain the mind essays to trace The glories of thy countless race, In vain thy king's imperial state Shall haughty Agag emulate. His mighty God's protecting hand Led him from Pharoah's tyrant land. Strong as the beast that rules the plain, What power his fury shall restrain? Who dares resist, his force shall feel. The nations see, and trembling fly, Or in th' unequal conflict die; And glut with blood his thirsty steel. With aspect keen he mark'd his prey,--- He couch'd---In secret ambush lay.--- Who shall the furious lion dare? Who shall unmov'd his terrors see? \---Blest, who for thee exalts his prayer! And curst the wretch, who curseth thee! The particular style and character of the different Prophets: what parts of each of them are poetical, and what otherwise. ---Nothing deserving of notice of this kind in the poetry of Greece.---In the Latin poetry the fourth Eclogue of Virgil is remarkable; that poem much more obscure than it is generally accounted, and has not hitherto been properly explained . "THE Prophets have each their peculiar character," says Jerome, speaking of the twelve minor prophets  425 . The same however might more properly be affirmed with respect to the three greater: for Isaiah is extremely different from Jeremiah; nor is it easy to conceive any composition of the same denomination more dissimilar to both of them than the book of Ezekiel. Isaiah, the first of the prophets, both in order and dignity, abounds in such transcendant excellencies, that he may be properly said to afford the most perfect model of the prophetic poetry. He is at once elegant and sublime, forcible and ornamented; he unites energy with copiousness, and dignity with variety. In his sentiments there is uncommon elevation and majesty; in his imagery the utmost propriety, elegance, dignity, and diversity; in his language uncommon beauty and energy; and, notwithstanding the obscurity of his subjects, a surprising degree of clearness and simplicity. To these we may add, there is such sweetness in the poetical composition of his sentences, whether it proceed from art or genius, that if the Hebrew poetry at present is possessed of any remains of its native grace and harmony, we shall chiefly find them in the writings of Isaiah: so that the saying of Ezekiel may most justly be applied to this prophet: "Thou art the confirmed exemplar of measures, Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty  426 ." Isaiah greatly excels too in all the graces of method, order, connexion, and arrangement: though in asserting this we must not forget the nature of the prophetic impulse, which bears away the mind with irresistible violence, and frequently in rapid transitions from near to remote objects, from human to divine: we must also be careful in remarking the limits of particular predictions, since, as they are now extant, they are often improperly connected, without any marks of discrimination, which injudicious arrangement, on some occasions, creates almost insuperable difficulties. I lately produced a specimen from this prophet of a complete poem disposed in the most perspicuous order; and in the former part of his volume many instances may be found, where the particular predictions are distinctly marked. The latter part, which I suppose to commence at the fortieth chapter, is perhaps the most elegant specimen remaining of inspired composition, and yet in this respect is attended with considerable difficulty. It is, in fact, a body or collection of different prophecies, nearly allied to each other as to the subject, which, for that reason, having a sort of connexion, are not to be separated but with the utmost difficulty. The general subject is the restoration of the church. Its deliverance from captivity; the destruction of idolatry; the vindication of the divine power and truth; the consolation of the Israelites, the divine invitation which is extended to them, their incredulity, impiety, and rejection; the calling in of the Gentiles; the restoration of the chosen people; the glory and felicity of the church in its perfect state; and the ultimate destruction of the wicked, are all set forth with a sufficient respect to order and method. If we read these passages with attention, and duly regard the nature and genius of the mystical allegory, as explained in the eleventh Lecture; at the same time remembering, that all these points have been frequently touched upon in other prophecies promulged at different times, we shall neither find any irregularity in the arrangement of the whole, nor any want of order and connexion as to matter or sentiment in the different parts. I must add, that I esteem the whole book of Isaiah to be poetical, a few passages excepted, which, if brought together, would not at most exceed the bulk of five or six chapters. Jeremiah, though deficient neither in elegance nor sublimity, must give place in both to Isaiah. Jerome  427 seems to object against him a sort of rusticity of language, no vestige of which, I must however confess, I have been able to discover. His sentiments, it is true, are not always the most elevated, nor are his periods always neat and compact; but these are faults common to those writers, whose principal aim is to excite the gentler affections, and to call forth the tear of sympathy or sorrow. This observation is very strongly exemplified in the Lamentations, where these are the prevailing passions; it is however frequently instanced in the prophecies of this author, and most of all in the beginning of the book 428 , which is chiefly poetical. The middle of it is almost entirely historical. The latter part, again, consisting of the six last chapters, is altogether poetical  429 ; it contains several different predictions, which are distinctly marked, and in these the prophet approaches very near the sublimity of Isaiah. On the whole, however, I can scarcely pronounce above half the book of Jeremiah to be poetical. Ezekiel is much inferior to Jeremiah in elegance; in sublimity he is not even excelled by Isaiah: but his sublimity is of a totally different kind  430 . He is deep, vehement, tragical; the only sensation he affects to excite is the terrible: his sentiments are elevated, fervid, full of fire, indignant; his imagery is crouded, magnificent, terrific, sometimes almost to disgust; his language is pompous, solemn, austere, rough, and at times unpolished: he employs frequent repetitions, not for the sake of grace or elegance, but from the vehemence of passion and indignation. Whatever subject he treats of, that he sedulously pursues, from that he rarely departs, but cleaves as it were to it; whence the connexion is in general evident and well preserved. In many respects he is perhaps excelled by the other prophets; but in that species of composition to which he seems by nature adapted, the forcible, the impetuous, the great and solemn, not one of the sacred writers is superior to him. His diction is sufficiently perspicuous, all his obscurity consists in the nature of the subject. Visions, (as for instance among others, those of Hosea, Amos, and Jeremiah) are necessarily dark and confused. The greater part of Ezekiel, towards the middle of the book especially, is poetical, whether we regard the matter or the diction. His periods, however, are frequently so rude and incompact, that I am often at a loss how to pronounce concerning his performance in this respect. Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, as far as relates to style, may be said to hold the same rank among the Hebrews, as Homer, Simonides, and Æschylus among the Greeks. Hosea is the first in order of the minor prophets, and is, perhaps, Jonah excepted, the most ancient of them all. His style exhibits the appearance of very remote antiquity; it is pointed, energetic, and concise. It bears a distinguished mark of poetical composition, in that pristine brevity and condensation, which is observable in the sentences, and which later writers have in some measure neglected. This peculiarity has not escaped the observation of Jerome: "He is altogether," says he, speaking of this prophet, "laconic and sententious  431 " But this very circumstance, which anciently was supposed, no doubt, to impart uncommon force and elegance, in the present ruinous state of the Hebrew literature, is productive of so much obscurity, that although the general subject of this writer be sufficiently obvious, he is the most difficult and perplexed of all the prophets. There is, however, another reason for the obscurity of his style: Hosea prophesied during the reigns of the four kings of Judah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah; the duration of his ministry, therefore, in whatever manner we calculate, must include a very considerable space of time; we have now only a small volume of his remaining, which, it seems, contains his principal prophecies; and these are extant in a continued series, with no marks of distinction as to the times in which they were published, or the subjects of which they treat. There is therefore no cause to wonder, if in perusing the prophecies of Hosea, we sometimes find ourselves in a similar predicament with those who consulted the scattered leaves of the Sibyl. The style of Joel is essentially different from that of Hosea; but the general character of his diction, though of a different kind, is not less poetical. He is elegant, perspicuous, copious, and fluent; he is also sublime, animated, and energetic. In the first and second chapters he displays the full force of the Prophetic Poetry, and shews how naturally it inclines to the use of metaphors, allegories, and comparisons. Nor is the connexion of the matter less clear and evident, than the complexion of the style: this is exemplified in the display of the impending evils, which gave rise to the prophecy; the exhortation to repentance; the promises of happiness and success both terrestrial and eternal to those who become truly penitent; the restoration of the Israelites; and the vengeance to be taken of their adversaries. But while we allow this just commendation to his perspicuity both in language and arrangement, we must not deny that there is sometimes great obscurity observable in his subject, and particularly in the latter part of the prophecy. Jerome calls Amos "rude in speech, but not in knowledge  432 ;" applying to him what St. Paul modestly professes of himself  433 . Many have followed the authority of Jerome, in speaking of this prophet, as if he were indeed quite rude, ineloquent, and destitute of all the embellishments of composition. The matter is, however, far otherwise. Let any person who has candour and perspicacity enough to judge, not from the man but from his writings, open the volume of his predictions, and he will, I think, agree with me, that our shepherd "is not a whit behind the very chief of the prophets  434 ." He will agree that as in sublimity and magnificence he is almost equal to the greatest, so in splendour of diction, and elegance of expression he is scarcely inferior to any. The same celestial Spirit indeed actuated Isaiah and Daniel in the court, and Amos in the sheep-folds; constantly selecting such interpreters of the divine will as were best adapted to the occasion, and sometimes "from the mouth of babes and sucklings perfecting praise:" occassionally employing the natural eloquence of some, and occasionally making others eloquent. The style of Micah is for the most part close, forcible, pointed, and concise; sometimes approaching the obscurity of Hosea: in many parts animated and sublime, and in general truly poetical. None of the minor prophets, however, seem to equal Nahum, in boldness, ardour, and sublimity. His prophecy too forms a regular and perfect poem; the exordium is not merely magnificent, it is truly majestic; the preparation for the destruction of Nineveh, and the description of its downfal and desolation are expressed in the most vivid colours, and are bold and luminous in the highest degree. The style of Habbakkuk is also poetical; especially in his ode, which indeed may be accounted among the most perfect specimens of that class  435 . The like remark will also apply to Zephaniah; but there is nothing very striking or uncommon either in the arrangement of his matter or the complexion of his style. Of Obadiah there is little to be said; the only specimen of his genius extant being very short, and the greater part of it included in one of the prophecies of Jeremiah  436 . Jonah and Daniel, I have already considered as mere historical commentaries. Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, are the only remaining prophets. The first of these is altogether prosaic, as well as the greater part of the second; towards the conclusion of the prophecy there are some poetical passages, and those highly ornamented; they are also perspicuous, considering that they are the production of the most obscure of all the prophetic writers  437 . The last of the prophetical books, that of Malachi, is written in a kind of middle style, which seems to indicate that the Hebrew poetry, from the time of the Babylonish captivity, was in a declining state, and being past its prime and vigour, was then fast verging towards the debility of age. Thus far I have thought proper to deliver my sentiments, as distinctly as I was able, concerning the writings of the prophets, and those parts which are to be accounted poetical or otherwise. This I did with a view of clearly explaining my conjecture (for I dare not dignify it with any higher appellation) concerning the Prophetic Poetry. A conjecture, which, though I will confess it is not without its difficulties, and which must, after all, depend in some degree upon opinion, yet I flatter myself, you will concur with me in admitting not to be utterly destitute of foundation. I should now, according to the nature of my plan, proceed to speak of the Prophetic Poetry of the Greeks, if indeed any thing had been transmitted to us, even from their most celebrated oracles, deserving, I will not say, to be compared with the sacred prophets, but even to be mentioned at all. The fact is, there is no such poem now extant, nor do I believe there ever was one of that kind among the Greeks: a few verses there are indeed remaining, and those not above mediocrity; for the Pythian Apollo, if we may credit the Greeks themselves, was not always upon the best terms with the Muses  438 . It appears, therefore, that he did not fail to excite the ridicule of sensible persons, not only for his ambiguous and enigmatical divinations, but for ignorance in the art of versification: nay, even the rude and superstitious, who gave him the amplest credit for the veracity of his predictions, could not help confessing, that he was a very indifferent poet 439 . Among the literature of the Romans, however, there is extant a much celebrated, and indeed admirable poem of this kind, no less remarkable for the elegance and perspicuity of the style, than for the obscurity and darkness of the subject: I speak of the fourth Eclogue of Virgil  440 , which it would be inexcuseable to pass unnoticed in this place, since from the first ages of Christianity an opinion has prevailed, that this poem bore some remote relation to those genuine remains of prophecy, which have been the subject of this Lecture, and indeed that the substance of it was originally derived from some sacred fountain. The manner in which this could happen, I must confess, is not very easy to be explained: whether to account for the fact we have recourse to the ancient Greek translation of the Scriptures, the publication of which was certainly many years anterior to the Roman poet; or whether we suppose that the author might apply to those translations, which were made from the sacred writings by some Hellenistic Jews, and which were handed about as the prophecies of the Sibyls  441 . However this may have been, there are so many, and so manifest indications of the fact in the poem itself, that no person who reads it attentively can retain a doubt upon this head. The sentiments, the imagery, even the language itself has so direct an agreement with the sacred prophets; the subject has so much of intrinsic sublimity and magnificence; and on the other hand it is enlivened with so much boldness and spirit, is indeed so free and elevated, that considering it as the production of the chastest and most reserved of all the later poets, there is something altogether mysterious in the fact, unless we suppose that he deduced his materials from some higher source than his own genius. Though the subject has engaged the attention of some of the first literary characters in the world, the motive, the scheme, the intention of the poet still remains, and I fear ever will remain undeveloped. The history and state of the Roman commonwealth at the time point out no circumstance or character, which appears to bear a sufficient relation to the subject, or which could afford room for such great and magnificent predictions  442 This I will freely confess, that the more I have contemplated this extraordinary production in this point of view, the less able I have felt myself to comprehend it. There is such a splendour of style, such an elegance in the versification, as deceives us at first respecting the obscurity of the matter. But on a nearer inspection of each particular, on a thorough examination of the nature and force of the imagery and diction, so many things occur totally different from the general fashion of the Roman authors, so altogether foreign to the conceptions of the people of that age and nation, that it is not easy to believe it was perfectly understood even on its first publication. But when a foreign interpretation, suggested by the writings of the Hebrews (the full force and importance of which it is impossible the poet himself could have comprehended) serves to unravel the difficulties, and to enlighten all the obscurities of this extraordinary poem; when I consider this, I own I am at a loss at what point to stop the licentiousness of conjecture upon this subject: and indeed what imagination occasionally suggests, I dare scarcely express. I will only say, the fact has something in it so extraordinary, so miraculous to my conceptions, that I am sometimes half inclined to fancy, that what Socrates, in the Io of Plato, says (probably in his usual tone of irony) of poets in general, might have actually come to pass: "Hence," says the philosopher, "the God, having by possessing their minds deprived them of their natural reason, makes use of them, as well as of the prophets and diviners, as his ministers, to the end, that we who hear them should understand, that matters of so great importance are not uttered by men in their sober senses, but that it is the God himself who utters them, and addresses us by their mouths." LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH. The nature and origin of the Hebrew Elegy traced into the solemn expressions of grief exhibited in their funeral ceremonies.---The office and function of professed mourners: the dirges, which were sung by them, were short, metrical, and sententious; many of the lamentations, which are extant in the Prophets, were composed in imitation of them. ---The whole of the Lamentations of Jeremiah constructed upon the same principle.---The general conduct and form of that poem; the nature of the verse; the subject and the style . the human mind, has been, I apprehend, very clearly evinced. The distribution of in into its different species is not, however, exactly regulated by the nature and order of the passions; though I think this is a circumstance which ought not entirely to be disregarded. There are, indeed, some species of poetry which admit of every passion, such as the Lyric; and there are some which scarcely admit of any, such as the Didactic: there are others, however, which are peculiarly adapted to particular passions, tragedy for instance; and we have already had occasion to explain the nature of the passions which are congenial to the prophetic Muse. There is a distinct species of poetry, which is appropriated solely to one particular passion; and, what is worth remarking, we have never known a people, who might be said to have made any proficiency in poetry, who had not a peculiar form of poem, invented purposely for the expression of sorrow, and appropriated wholly to plaintive subjects. 443 . This species of poem the Greeks, and most nations after them, distinguish by the name of Elegy: the Hebrews call it Kinah or Nehi , both which are significant of sorrow, or lamentation. The genius and origin of this poem among the Hebrews may be clearly traced into their manner of celebrating their funeral rites. It may indeed more properly be termed the dictate of Nature than of Custom, to follow to the grave the remains of a friend with grief and lamentation. The ancient Hebrews were not ashamed of obeying the voice of nature on this occasion, and of liberally pouring forth the effusions of a bleeding heart. The language of grief is simple and unaffected; it consists of a plaintive, intermitted, concise form of expression, if indeed a simple exclamation of sorrow may deserve such an appellation. "O father! O my country! O house of Priam  444 !" exclaims Andromache in the tragedy: nor less pathetic is the complaint of the tender father in the Sacred History, on the loss of his beloved, though disobedient son; "O my son, Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son  445 !" There will not, therefore, be occasion for any laboured disquisition concerning that kind of solemn dirge which was used at funerals; but since the sacred writers afford many examples to this purpose, I shall select one or two. The Prophet of Bethlehem brought the corpse of the man of God, who was slain by the lion, back to the city, that he might mourn over him and bury him. He placed him in his own sepulchre, and they wept over him, saying, "Alas, my brother  446 !" So in Jeremiah, Jehovah declares of Joachim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah: "They shall not lament him, Ah my brother, or ah sister! They shall not lament him, Ah Lord, or ah his glory  447 !" These and similar exclamations were sufficient for the simple expression of natural and unaffected sorrow. But wayward grief is frequently desirous of a more complete and ostentatious display of its feelings; it studies not only its own alleviation, by publishing its uneasiness, but endeavours to incite and allure others into a society in affliction. Thus when Abner fell a sacrifice to the treachery of Joab, David not being privy to the action, and in truth extremely afflicted on account of it; yet, from the difficulty of his situation, and the infant state of his authority, not daring to punish the murderer, he fulfils his duty both to himself and to the deceased in the eyes of the people, by attending the funeral in the character of chief mourner: "and he lifted up his voice and wept at the sepulchre, and all the people wept with him;" and then by the united aid of poetry and music, he further stimulates their affliction: "and the king lamented Abner, and said:" Did Abner fall a mean and guilty slave? With goary fetters were his limbs defil'd? Lo, abject treachery snar'd th' uncautious brave; And wily fraud his honest heart beguil'd! "and again all the people wept over him  448 ." Thus, a certain ostentatious zeal, which frequently accompanies real sorrow, is apt to persuade men, that it is impossible to pay too much respect to the memory of departed friends; that intemperance of passion too, which is always observable in these cases, which is self-indulgent to excess, and is more inclined to irritate than to soothe; in a word, opinion or fashion, which governs and misleads the bulk of mankind, easily persuades them that it is an indispensible duty incumbent upon the living to afflict themselves for the sake of the dead. Each of these causes has contributed to establish that custom, which prevailed in Palestine, in Phrygia  449 , and afterwards among the Greeks and Romans, of engaging mercenary mourners to weep at their funerals. This office generally fell to the lot of the women, either because it was supposed more congenial to the general imbecility of the female mind, or because, from the flexibility and softness of their nature, and from their tender and plaintive tone of voice, they were supposed more capable of working upon the affections. After the custom was once established, we find no scarcity of these professional mourners, well accomplished in all the discipline of lamentation and woe, and with tears always at command for a reasonable stipend. As in all other arts, so in this, perfection consisted in the exact imitation of nature. The funereal dirges were therefore composed in general upon the model of those complaints which flow naturally and spontaneously from the afflicted heart: the sentences were abrupt, mournful, pathetic, simple, and unembellished; on one account, indeed, more elaborate and artificial, because they consisted of verse, and were chanted to music  450 . Many vestiges of this custom are found in the writings of the Prophets: for the predictions of calamity impending over states and empires are often replete with elegance, and generally assume the form of a funereal song. But this remark will be more clearly evidenced by a few examples; and these examples will serve at the same time to illustrate what has been alledged concerning this custom. Hear,  451 says the prophet Amos, addressing the Israelites, and denouncing vengeance and destruction against them, and their government, Hear my voice, O Israel, hear! Whilst I thy fate deplore: Thy virgin daughter, Sion! falls--- She falls to rise no more! And a little after  452 ; Through the streets, and through the plains, The doleful rumour flies; And skilful mourners raise their voice In sad funereal cries. And in Jeremiah, on a similar occasion, Jehovah of Hosts thus addresses his people  453 : Let those well-taught in Sorrow's school Resound the notes of woe; And mournful music, through the land, In solemn concord flow; Till tears shall stream from every eye, Till every heart shall fear.--- Hark, 'tis the mourner's voice that sounds! 'Tis Sion's dirge I hear! Vanquish'd, enthrall'd, to plunder giv'n, The haughty city falls; Shrill shrieks of woe aloud resound, While ruin shakes her walls.--- "We go---deserted and forlorn, To rove from shore to shore; These long-lov'd seats no more to view, These pleasant plains no more." Yet hear!-'tis heaven's most high decree! The solemn rites prepare! Let Sion's daughters raise the dirge, Replete with wild despair. The regal dome, the sacred fane, Stern Death invades, and wastes the land; The pride of Israel strews the plain, Like sheaves beneath the reaper's hand. Many instances of the same kind occur throughout the Prophets, in which, as in these, there is a direct allusion to the institution from which they originated. There are also many other passages evidently of the same kind, although the funeral ceremonies be not immediately referred to; and the peculiar elegance of these we shall not perceive, unless some regard be paid to the object to which they allude. The examples that I have produced are, I apprehend, sufficient to indicate the nature and origin of this species of poetry, and to demonstrate, that these artificial complaints were originally formed on the model, and expressed in the language of real sorrow. Hence also it will be apparent, in what manner, and by what gradations, the Kinah , or Lamentations of the Hebrews, assumed the form of a regular poem: but for the further elucidation of this subject, it may not be improper to examine the Lamentations of Jeremiah, the most remarkable poem of this kind extant, according to the principles of these funereal compositions; for unless we examine it in this manner, and by this criterion, it will be impossible to form a right judgment concerning it. I shall endeavour to treat of this extraordinary production in the following order: First, of its nature and form in general; secondly, of the metre or versification; and lastly, of the subject, the sentiments, and imagery. The Lamentations of Jeremiah (for the title is properly and significantly plural) consist of a number of plaintive effusions, composed upon the plan of the funeral dirges, all upon the same subject, and uttered without connexion as they rose in the mind, in a long course of separate stanzas. These have afterwards been put together, and formed into a collection or correspondent whole. If any Reader, however, should expect to find in them an artificial and methodical arrangement of the general subject, a regular disposition of the parts, a perfect connexion and orderly succession in the matter, and with all this, an uninterrupted series of elegance and correctness, he will really expect what was foreign to the Prophet's design. (In the character of a mourner, he celebrates in plaintive strains the obsequies of his ruined country; whatever presented itself to his mind in the midst of desolation and misery, whatever struck him as particularly wretched and calamitous, whatever the instant sentiment of sorrow dictated, he pours forth in a kind of spontaneous effusion. He frequently pauses, and, as it were, ruminates upon the same object; frequently varies and illustrates the same thought with different imagery, and a different choice of language; so that the whole bears rather the appearance of an accumulation of corresponding sentiments, than an accurate and connected series of different ideas, arranged in the form of a regular treatise. I would not be understood to insinuate, that the author has paid no regard whatever to order or arrangement; or that transitions truly elegant from one subject, image, or character, to another, are not sometimes to be found; this only I wished to remark, that the nature and design of this poem (being in reality a collection of different sentiments or subjects, each of which assumes the form of a funeral dirge) neither require, nor even admit of a methodical arrangement. The whole poem, however, may be divided into five parts; in the first, second, and fourth, the Prophet addresses the people in his own person, or else personifies Jerusalem, and introduces that city as a character; the third part is supposed to be uttered by the chorus of Jews, represented by their leader  454 , after the manner of the Greek tragedies: and in the fifth, the whole nation of the Jews, on being led into captivity, pour forth their united complaints to Almighty God. This last, as well as the others, is divided into twenty-two periods, according to the number of the letters of the alphabet; with this difference, that in the four other parts the initial letters of each period exactly correspond with the alphabetical order. And from this circumstance we have been enabled to form some little judgment concerning the Hebrew metres. The acrostic or alphabetical poetry of the Hebrews was certainly intended to assist the memory, and was confined altogether to those compositions, which consisted of detached maxims or sentiments without any express order or connexion  455 . The same custom is said to have been prevalent, indeed is said still to prevail in some degree, among the Syrians, the Persians, and the Arabs  456 . With how much propriety the Prophet has employed this form of composition, on the present occasion, is evident from what has been said concerning the nature of this poem. The manner and order of this kind of verse is as follows: Each of the five parts, or grand divisions is subdivided into twenty-two periods, or stanzas; these periods in the three first parts are all of them triplets, in other words, consist each of three lines, only, in each of the two former parts, there is one period consisting of four lines  457 . In the four first parts, the initial letter of each period follows the order of the alphabet; but the third part is so very regular, that every line in the same period begins with the same letter, so as necessarily to ascertain the length of every verse or line in that poem: indeed, even in the others, though the lines are not distinctly marked in this manner, it is no difficult matter to ascertain their limits, by resolving the sentences into their constituent members. By this mode of computation it appears, that in the fourth part all the periods consist of distichs  458 , as also in the fifth, which is not acrostic: but in this last part I must remark another peculiarity, namely, that the lines are extremely short, whereas in all the rest they are long. The length of these metres is worthy of notice: we find in this poem lines or verses, which are evidently longer by almost one half, than those which occur usually, and on other occasions. The length of them seems to be, on an average, about twelve syllables; there are a few which do not quite amount to that number, and there are a few which perhaps exceed it by two or three syllables: for although nothing certain can be determined concerning the number of syllables (in truth I pay no attention to the fictions of the Masorites) there is room, nevertheless, for very probable conjecture. We are not to suppose this peculiar form of versification utterly without design or importance: on the contrary, I am persuaded, that the Prophet adopted this kind of metre as being more diffuse, more copious, more tender, in all respects better adapted to melancholy subjects. I must add, that in all probability the funeral dirges, which were sung by the mourners, were commonly composed in this kind of verse; for whenever, in the prophets, any funereal lamentations occur, or any passages formed upon that plan, the versification is, if I am not mistaken, of this protracted kind. If this then be the case, we have discovered a true legitimate form of Elegy in the poetry of the Hebrews. It ought, however, to be remarked, that the same kind of metre is sometimes, though rarely, employed upon other occasions by the sacred Poets, as it was indeed by the Greeks and Romans. There are, moreover, some poems manifestly of the elegiac kind, which are composed in the usual metre, and not in unconnected stanzas, according to the form of a funeral dirge. Thus far in general as to the nature and method of the poem, and the form of the versification; it remains to offer a few remarks concerning the subject and the style. That the subject of the Lamentations is the destruction of the holy city and temple, the overthrow of the state, the extermination of the people, and that these events are described as actually accomplished, and not in the style of prediction merely, must be evident to every reader. Though some authors of considerable reputation  459 have imagined this poem to have been composed on the death of king Josiah. The Prophet, indeed, has so copiously, so tenderly, and poetically bewailed the misfortunes of his country, that he seems completely to have fulfilled the office and duty of a mourner. In my opinion, there is not extant any poem, which displays such a happy and splendid selection of imagery in so concentrated a state. What can be more elegant and poetical, than the description of that once flourishing city, lately chief among the nations, sitting in the character of a female, solitary, afflicted, in a state of widowhood, deserted by her friends, betrayed by her dearest connections, imploring relief, and seeking consolation in vain? What a beautiful personification is that of "the Ways of Sion mourning because none are come to her solemn feasts?" How tender and pathetic are the following complaints? "Is this nothing to all you who pass along the way? behold and see, If there be any sorrow, like unto my sorrow, which is inflicted on me; Which Jehovah inflicted on me in the day of the violence of his wrath. For these things I weep, my eyes stream with water; Because the comforter is far away, that should tranquilize my soul: My children are desolate, because the enemy was strong  460 ." But to detail its beauties would be to transcribe the entire poem. I shall make but one remark relative to certain passages, and to the former part of the second alphabet in particular. If, in this passage, the Prophet should be thought by some to affect a style too bold and energetic for the expression of sorrow, let them only advert to the greatness of the subject, its importance, sanctity, and solemnity; and let them consider that the nature of the performance absolutely required these to be set forth in a style suitable, in some degree at least, to their inherent dignity; let them attentively consider these things, and I have not a doubt, but they will readily excuse the sublimity of the Prophet. Many poems of this kind still extant in the writings of the Hebrews .--- One collection of Elegies or Lamentations appears to be lost .--- Elegies in Ezekiel .--- Many passages in Job may be accounted Elegiac .--- About a seventh part of the book of Psalms consists of Elegies .--- A perfect specimen of elegiac poetry from the Psalms .--- The Lamentation of David over Saul and Jonathan explained: attempted in English verse . IN the last Lecture the nature and origin of the Hebrew Elegy was explained; the form and commencement of that species of poetry was traced into the solemn dirges which were chanted at funerals by the professed mourners; and this was confirmed by instances taken from those short Elegies or Lamentations which occur in the Prophets, and by an accurate examination of that remarkable poem, the Lamentations of Jeremiah. I shall now treat of some other poems, which, although they do not exactly assume the form of a funereal dirge, are nevertheless to be comprehended in this class. That the Hebrews were formerly possessed of some collection of Elegies or Lamentations, which has not been transmitted to us, we may understand from that passage of sacred history  461 , in which mention is made of the solemn mourning publicly celebrated at the funeral of Josiah; where it appears that a poem, composed for the occasion by Jeremiah the prophet, amongst others had a place. Though the book, which is on this occasion referred to, and which probably contained the most excellent of the Hebrew Elegies, appears to be lost, there are still extant many specimens of this kind of poetry; whence we may reasonably infer, that no species of composition was more in use among the Hebrews than the elegiac, the ode perhaps only excepted. In the first place, beside those short dirges, which occur in the writings of almost all the prophets, as was before remarked, there are some in Ezekiel, which are actually distinguished by the title of Lamentations, and which may with the utmost propriety be referred to the class of Elegies. Among these are the two Lamentations concerning Tyre, and the king of Tyre  462 . In these, though the intent of the prophet be to denounce vengeance and punishment against these objects of the divine wrath, rather than to lament their misfortunes; and though he succeed in his aim of exciting terror instead of pity, yet the mournful nature of the subject fully corresponds with the title, and both the matter and the sentiments bear some degree of resemblance to the funereal songs. According to the custom which prevailed on those solemn occasions, the glory, riches, and power of the deceased are pompously enumerated; and thus by contrasting his former prosperity with the present calamity, the effect is considerably augmented. As for the two prophecies  463 , in which the destruction of Egypt is predicted, they seem to have been entitled Lamentations merely from the mournful nature of the subject; for they contain nothing of the elegiac form or style, scarcely any sentiment expressive of sorrow, and seem altogether composed for the denunciation of vengeance, and the exciting of terror. Two other Lamentations  464 , the one over the princes of Judah, and the other over Jerusalem, may be explained upon similar principles: they are indeed poetical parables, and have been already noticed in their proper place. There are also many passages in that most admirable poem, which bears the name of Job  465 , deserving to be accounted legitimate elegies: and indeed I do not know any more perfect specimens of this species of composition; so completely are the inmost recesses of sorrow displayed, and the remotest fountains of pity explored and laid open. But since these are parts of an entire poem, they are not rashly to be detached from the body of the work; and since the elegant disposition, and the extraordinary beauties of this inimitable composition, will deserve a fuller examination, it is sufficient in this place to have mentioned these passages as exquisite treasures, which the Muse of Sorrow might legally claim as her own, were she disposed to assert her rigid rights. I proceed, therefore, to the book of Psalms, which is a collection, under the general title of hymns to the praise of God, containing poems of different kinds, and elegies among the rest. If indeed the contents of the book were methodically arranged in their proper classes, not less than a sixth or seventh part would appear to be elegiac. Since, however, this is a matter dependant in a great measure upon opinion, and not to be clearly demonstrated upon determinate principles; since the nature of the subject, the complexion of the style, or the general form and disposition of each poem, must decide the question; and since different persons will judge differently upon these points; it will hardly be expected that I should on this occasion proceed to the regular classification of them. It will indeed be more to your advantage, and more to our present purpose, to select an example which may be clearly demonstrated to belong to the elegiac class. Under this appellation then I shall not hesitate to recommend to your notice the forty-second Psalm, since I cannot help esteeming it one of the most beautiful specimens of the Hebrew Elegy. The author of this elegant complaint, exiled from the temple, and from the public exercise of his religion, to the extreme parts of Judea, persecuted by his numerous enemies, and agitated by their reproaches, pours forth his soul to God in this tender and pathetic composition. The ardent feelings of a devout heart are admirably expressed, while the memory of former felicity seems to aggravate his present anguish. The extreme anxiety of a mind, depressed by the burthen of sorrow, and yet at the same time impatient under it; overcome by an accumulation of evils, yet in some degree endeavouring to resist them, and admitting, through the dark cloud of affliction, a glimmering ray of hope and consolation, is finely depicted. In frequent and almost instantaneous transitions he glows with love, and droops with lamentation; he complains, he expostulates; he despairs, and yet hopes; he is afflicted, and again consoled. It is not to be expected that any poetical version should express these sentiments with the force, the energy, and more particularly with the conciseness of the Hebrew, which is indeed not to be imitated in any other language: though it must be confessed, that this poem is more diffuse than the Hebrew poetry in general. The following paraphrase however, though infinitely short of the original in sublimity, will perhaps serve to evince the correspondence of the subject and sentiments of this poem, with the elegiac productions of modern times: As pants the wearied hart for cooling springs, That sinks exhausted in the summer's chase; So pants my soul for thee, Great King of kings! So thirsts to reach thy sacred resting-place. On briny tears  466 my famish'd soul has fed, While taunting foes deride my deep despair; "Say, where is now thy great Deliverer fled? Thy mighty God --- Deserted wanderer, where?" Oft dwell my thoughts on those thrice happy days, When to thy fane I led the jocund throng; Our mirth was worship, all our pleasure praise, And festal joys still clos'd with sacred song. Why throb my heart? Why sink my sad'ning soul? Why droop to earth with various woes oppress'd? My years shall yet in blissful circles roll, And joy be yet an inmate of this breast. By Jordan's banks with devious steps I stray, O'er Hermon's rugged rocks, and deserts drear: Ev'n there thy hand shall guide my lonely way, There, thy remembrance shall my spirit cheer. In rapid floods the vernal torrents roll, Harsh-sounding cataracts responsive roar; Thine angry billows overwhelm my soul, And dash my shatter'd bark from shore to shore. Yet thy soft mercies, ever in my sight, My heart shall gladden through the tedious day; And midst the dark and gloomy shades of night, To thee I'll fondly tune the grateful lay. Rock of my hope! Great solace of my heart! Why, why desert the offspring of thy care, While taunting foes thus point th' invidious dart? "Where's now thy God! abandon'd wanderer, where?" Why faint my soul? why doubt Jehovah's aid? Thy God, the God of mercy still shall prove! In his bright fane thy thanks shall yet be paid; Unquestion'd be his pity and his love  467 ! Another point, to which I would wish every person who reads this Psalm in the original to advert, is the division of the periods, and the resolution of them into their constituent parts or members; he will find, I believe, that the periods spontaneously divide into verses of nearly equal length and measure, exactly similar to those of the four first chapters of the Lamentations of Jeremiah; such as I before remarked appeared to constitute the established metre of the Hebrew Elegy. The whole of the nineteenth Psalm consists also of the same kind of verse, except the Epode, which contains two long verses of the same kind, and one shorter, which last is once repeated. The forty-third Psalm too seems to be constructed upon similar principles, containing eight of the same kind of verses, with the same Epode. And since it is written in the same train of sentiment, the same style, and even apparently in the same metre, it ought not perhaps to be separated from the preceding Psalm  468 , but rather to be considered as a part or continuation of the same composition: if this be true, the whole poem consists of three parts almost equal and alike, each of which is concluded by the same intercalary period or stanza. There is another most beautiful poem of the elegiac kind, which on this occasion solicits our attention, I mean the Lamentation of David for Saul and Jonathan  469 ; which appears to have been extracted by the historian from some poetical book, no longer extant, entitled Jasher 470 . It will not, I flatter myself, be thought unreasonable to request your attention, while I endeavour to investigate, with some degree of accuracy, the nature and composition of this poem. The Poet treats, though in no common manner, two common topics, and those the best adapted to the genuine Elegy; that I mean, which was employed in the celebration of the funeral rites; he expresses his own sorrow; and he celebrates the praises of the deceased. Both sentiments are displayed in the exordium; but, as might naturally be expected, sorrow is predominant, and bursts forth with the impetuosity of exclamation: "The glory of Israel is slain on the high-places: How are the mighty fallen!" Grief is of a timid and suspicious temper; and always ready at inventing causes for self-torment; easily offended by neglect, and utterly impatient of ridicule or contempt: "They heard that I sighed, for there was none to comfort me: All mine enemies have heard of my calamity, and rejoiced that thou inflictedst it  471 ." So Jerusalem complains in Jeremiah, exaggerating in the strongest terms her own misfortunes. Our Poet feels and expresses himself in almost the same manner: "Declare it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ascalon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph." The same passion is also sullen and querulous, wayward and peevish, unable to restrain its impatience, and firing at every thing that opposes it. "Would! ne'er that in the Pelian grove"---says one of the characters in the Medea of Ennius  472 . On another occasion we find a person inveighing against the innocent mountain: "Alas! Betrayer, barren and accurst! What men, what heroes hast thou not destroy'd? Fatal alone to those, whose patriot worth Their noble birth by noblest acts proclaim'd  473 ." Our Poet is not more temperate: "O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you!" If these passages were brought before the severe tribunal of reason, nothing could appear more absurd; but if examined by the criterion of the passions, nothing can be more consonant to nature, more beautiful or emphatic. Not to refer effects to their real causes is in logic an imperfection, but in poetry often a beauty; the appeal in the one case is to reason, in the other to the passions. When sorrow has had sufficient vent, there is leisure to expatiate on the accomplishments of the dead. In the first place they are celebrated for their virtue and heroic actions; next for their piety and mutual affection; and lastly for their agility and strength. Saul is honoured with a particular panegyric, because he had enriched his people, and contributed to the general felicity and splendour of the state. This passage, by the way, is most exquisite composition; the women of Israel are most happily introduced, and the subject of the encomium is admirably adapted to the female characters  474 . Jonathan is at last celebrated in a distinct eulogium, which is beautifully pathetic, is animated with all the fervour, and sweetened with all the tenderness of friendship. I should have made some particular observations on the intercalary period or Epode inserted in the Psalm which was lately under our consideration, but that I was aware an opportunity would again persent itself during the examination of this poem. This recurrence of the same idea is perfectly congenial to the nature of Elegy; since grief is fond of dwelling upon the particular objects of the passion, and frequently repeating them. There is something singular, however, in the intercalary period which occurs in this poem, for it does not regularly assume the same form of words, as is the case in general, but appears with a little variation. It is three times introduced, beautifully diversified in the order and diction: it forms part of the exordium, as well as of the conclusion, and is once inserted in the body of the poem. Another observation, though it merit no higher title than a conjecture, I do not hesitate to submit to your consideration. There appears to be something singular in the versification of this Elegy, and a very free use of different metres. It neither consists altogether of the long verses, nor yet of the short ones (which are the most usual in the poetry of the Hebrews); but rather of a very artful and happy mixture of both, so that the concise and pointed parallelism serves to correct the languour and diffuseness of the elegiac verse: and this form of versification takes place also in some of the Psalms. Certainly there is a great appearance of art and design in this nice and poetical conformation of the periods: and that no grace or elegance should be wanting to this poem, it is no less remarkable for the general beauty, splendour, and perspicuity of the style. To do complete justice to the economy of this excellent production, it is absolutely necessary to exhibit it in an entire state. Not to tire you therefore with a repetition of the verbal translation, I have endeavoured to express the general sentiments and imagery in elegiac numbers. Thy glory, Israel, droops its languid head, On Gilboa's heights thy rising beauty dies; In sordid piles there sleep th' illustrious dead, The mighty victor fall'n and vanquish'd lies. Yet dumb be Grief---Hush'd be her clam'rous voice! Tell not in Gath the tidings of our shame! Lest proud Philistia in our woes rejoice, And rude barbarians blast fair Israel's fame. No more, O Gilboa! heaven's reviving dew With rising verdure crown thy fated head! No victim's blood thine altars dire imbrue! For there the blood of heaven's elect was shed. The sword of Saul ne'er spent its force in air; The shaft of Jonathan brought low the brave; In life united equal fates they share, In death united share one common grave. Swift as the eagle cleaves the aerial way, Through hosts of soes they bent their rapid course; Strong as the lion darts upon his prey, They crush'd the nations with resistless force. Daughters of Judah mourn the fatal day, In sable grief attend your monarch's urn; To solemn notes attune the pensive lay, And weep those joys that never shall return: With various wealth he made your tents o'erflow, In princely pride your charms profusely dress'd; Bade the rich robe with ardent purple glow, And sparkling gems adorn the tissu'd vest. On Gilboa's heights the mighty vanquish'd lies, The son of Saul, the generous and the just; Lest streaming sorrows ever fill these eyes, Let sacred tears bedew a brother's dust! Thy firm regard rever'd thy David's name, And kindest thoughts in kindest acts express'd; Not brighter glows the pure and generous flame, That lives within the tender virgin's breast. But vain the tear, and vain the bursting sigh, Though Sion's echoes with our griefs resound; The mighty victors fall'n and vanquish'd lie, And war's refulgent weapons strew the ground. The ancient mode of instructing by Parables or Proverbs .--- The Proverbs of Solomon: that work consists of two parts; the first, which extends to the ninth chapter inclusive, truly poetical, and most elegant in its kind: the remainder of the book consists of detached maxims.---The principal characteristics of a Parable or Proverb; brevity ( which naturally involves in it some degree of obscurity ) and elegance. ---Ecclesiastes: the argument, disposition, and style of that work.---All the alphabetical Psalms of this kind, as well as some others.---The wisdom of the son of Sirach, written originally in Hebrew, in imitation of the Proverbs of Solomon.---The fidelity of the Greek translator; and the great elegance of the work in general.---The wisdom of Solomon, written originally in Greek, and in imitation of the Proverbs; the style and economy of that book.---A new translation of the xxivth chapter of Ecclesiasticus . IN those periods of remote antiquity, which may with the utmost propriety be styled the infancy of societies and nations, the usual, if not the only, mode of instruction was by detached aphorisms or proverbs. Human wisdom was then indeed in a rude and unfinished state; it was not digested, methodized, or reduced to order and connexion. Those, who, by genius and reflexion, exercised in the school of experience, had accumulated a stock of knowledge, were desirous of reducing it into the most compendious form, and comprized in a few maxims those observations which they apprehended most essential to human happiness. This mode of instruction was, in truth, more likely than any other to prove efficacious with men in a rude stage of society; for it professed not to dispute, but to command; not to persuade, but to compel; it conducted them not by a circuit of argument, but led immediately to the approbation and practice of integrity and virtue. That it might not, however, be altogether destitute of allurement, and lest it should disgust by an appearance of roughness and severity, some degree of ornament became necessary; and the instructors of mankind added to their precepts the graces of harmony, and illuminated them with metaphors, comparisons, allusions, and the other embellishments of style. This manner, which with other nations prevailed only during the first periods of civilization, with the Hebrews continued to be a favourite style to the latest ages of their literature. It obtained among them the appellation of Mashalim (or Parables) as well because it consisted in a great measure of Parables strictly so called; as because it possessed uncommon force and authority over the minds of the auditors. Of this Didactic Poetry there are still extant many specimens in the writings of the Hebrews; and among these the first rank must be assigned to the Proverbs of Solomon. This work consists of two parts. The first, serving as a proem or exordium, includes the nine first chapters; and is varied, elegant, sublime, and truly poetical; the order of the subject is in general excellently preserved, and the parts are very aptly connected among themselves. It is embellished with many beautiful descriptions and personifications; the diction is polished, and abounds with all the ornaments of poetry; insomuch, that it scarcely yields in elegance and splendour to any of the sacred writings. The other part, which extends from the beginning of the tenth chapter to the end of the book, consists almost entirely of detached parables or maxims, which have but little in them of the sublime or poetical, except a certain energetic and concise turn of expression. Since the Didactic Poetry of the Hebrews assumes in general this unconnected and sententious form, and since this style intrudes itself into almost all the poetry of the Hebrews, and occurs frequently in poems of a character very different from the Didactic; I shall treat principally of this latter part of the book of Proverbs, and endeavour more minutely to investigate the precise nature of a parable or proverb. Solomon himself, in one of his proverbs, has explained the principal excellencies of this form of composition; exhibiting at once a complete definition of a parable or proverb, and a very happy specimen of what he describes: "Apples of gold in a net-work of silver Is a word seasonably spoken  475 ." Thus he insinuates, that grave and profound sentiments are to be set off by a smooth and well-turned phraseology, as the appearance of the most beautiful and exquisitely-coloured fruit, or the imitation of it perhaps in the most precious materials, is improved by the circumstance of shining, as through a veil, through the reticulations of a silver vessel exquisitely carved. Nay, he further intimates, that it is not only a neat turn and polished diction which must recommend them, but that truth itself acquires additional beauty, when partially discovered through the veil of elegant fiction and imagery. To consider the subject in a still more particular point of view, let brevity be admitted as the prime excellence of a proverb  476 . This is, indeed, a necessary condition, without which it can neither retain the name nor the nature. For if the sentiment be diffusely expressed, if even when it contains a double image, it exceed ten or at most twelve words, it is no longer a proverb but an harangue. For the discriminating sentiment must force itself on the mind by a single effort, and not by a tedious process; the language must be strong and condensed, rather omitting some circumstances that appear necessary, than admitting any thing superfluous. Horace himself insists upon this as one of the express rules of Didactic Poetry, and he has assigned the reason on which it is founded: "Short be the precept, which with ease is gain'd By docile minds, and faithfully retain'd  477 ." Solomon expresses the same sentiment in his own (that is the parabolic) manner: "The words of the wise are like goads, And like nails that are firmly fixed  478 That is, they instantaneously stimulate or affect the mind; they penetrate deeply, and are firmly retained. Some degree of obscurity is generally an attendant upon excessive brevity; and the parabolic style is so far from being abhorrent of this quality, that it seems frequently to affect it, and to regard it as a perfection. This obscurity is not indeed altogether without its uses: it whets the understanding, excites an appetite for knowledge, keeps alive the attention, and exercises the genius by the labour of the investigation. The human mind, moreover, is ambitious of having a share in the discovery of truth; excessive indolence or dulness only requires a very open and minute display, or prefers a passive inertness to the exercise and the praise of perspicacity and discernment; and that knowledge is ever most delightful, which we have compassed by our own efforts 479 . Other causes, however, independent of the brevity and conciseness of the language, have, in many cases, contributed to the obscurity of the parabolic style  480 . In the first place, some degree of obscurity necessarily attends those passages in which different objects are applied in succession to the illustration of each other, without any express marks of comparison: of this we have had an example in the parable just now quoted, and of this there are many other examples in the sacred writings. I will, nevertheless, select one or two, which are deserving of our attention for their peculiar propriety and elegance: "Clouds and wind without rain, Is a man who glories in a fallacious gift  481 ." The following is in a different form: "Gold, and abundance of rubies, And precious ornaments, are the lips of knowledge  482 ." Again, obscurity is almost inevitable, when the subject itself, to which the imagery appertains and alludes, is removed out of sight, and the sentiment assumes the form of allegory. Horace expresses a very common precept in plain language: "Learn the strong sense of pleasure to controul; With virtuous pride its blandishments disdain: Hurtful is pleasure, when 'tis bought with pain  483 ." But with how much more elegance does Solomon deliver the same precept in a figurative manner, and under the veil of allegory! "Hast thou found honey? Eat no more than may suffice thee: "Lest thou be satiated, and nauseate it.  484 ." Some obscurity also attends any comparison which is of extensive application: of this the following seems a pertinent example: "As in water face (answers) to face, So doth the heart of man to man  485 ." This is certainly very difficult to apply or to define, since it may refer in many different views to the faculties, genius, affections, will, attachments, manners, virtues, and vices of men, among which there generally subsists a certain agreement or similarity from imitation, and from habits which are insensibly caught in social intercourse. Lastly, not to dwell too long upon this subject, some obscurity succeeds, when the principal, or perhaps the whole force of a proverb or parable, does not lie in the direct and literal sense, but in something not immediately expressed, which is however concomitant with it: "The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, ." To dwell upon the external and literal sense of this proverb, will only bewilder the reader in the dubious turn of the expression; but how sublime, how profitable, is the sentiment, when it comes from the pen of the Psalmist, embellished with his usual perspicuity and animation? "He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who formed the eye, shall he not see  487 .?" The last quality that I shall mention as essential to a parable or proverb, is elegance; which is not inconsistent with brevity, or indeed with some degree of obscurity. I speak of elegance as it respects the sentiment, the imagery, and the diction, and of its union with all these we have already had sufficient proof in all the parables which have been quoted in the course of this Lecture. It may however be proper to remark in this place, that even those proverbs, which are the plainest, most obvious, and simple, which contain nothing remarkable either in sentiment or style, are not to be esteemed without their peculiar elegance, if they possess only brevity, and that neat, compact form, and roundness of period, which alone are sufficient to constitute a parable. Such is the maxim, quoted by David in the Sacred History, as an ancient proverb; "Wickedness will proceed from the wicked  488 ." Such is that of Solomon, "Hate stirreth up strifes; But love covereth all transgressions  489 ." And many others which might easily be produced from the same author. There is another Didactic work of Solomon, entitled Kohelet , (Ecclesiastes) or the Preacher; or rather perhaps Wisdom the Preacher, the general tenour and style of which is very different from the book of Proverbs, though there are many detached sentiments and proverbs interspersed. For the whole work is uniform, and confined to one subject, namely, the vanity of the world exemplified by the experience of Solomon, who is introduced in the character of a person investigating a very difficult question, examining the arguments on either side, and at length disengaging himself from an anxious and doubtful disputation. It would be very difficult to distinguish the parts and arrangement of this production; the order of the subject and the connexion of the arguments are involved in so much obscurity, that scarcely any two commentators have agreed concerning the plan of the work, and the accurate division of it into parts or sections. The truth is, the laws of methodical composition and arrangement were neither known by the Hebrews, nor regarded in their Didactic writings. They uniformly retained the old sententious manner, nor did they submit to method, even where the occasion appeared to demand it. The style of this work is, however, singular; the language is generally low, I might almost call it mean or vulgar; it is frequently loose, unconnected, approaching to the incorrectness of conversation; and possesses very little of the poetical character, even in the composition and structure of the periods: which peculiarity may possibly be accounted for from the nature of the subject. Contrary to the opinion of the Rabbies, Ecclesiastes has been classed among the poetical books; though if their authority and opinions were of any weight or importance, they might, perhaps, on this occasion, deserve some attention 490 . Some of the Psalms also belong properly to this class; the alphabetical, for instance, with some others. The alphabetical or acrostic form of composition has been more than once alluded to in the course of these Lectures. The chief commendation of these poems is, that they are excellently accommodated to ordinary use; that the sentiments are serious, devout, and practical; the language chaste and perspicuous; the composition neat, and regularly adapted to the sententious form. There are extant, besides these, two other considerable works of the Didactic kind, which the Hebrew poetry may legally claim, though they are only extant in Greek prose. I mean The Wisdom of the Son of Sirach, and that which is entitled The Wisdom of Solomon. The work of the Son of Sirach, translated from the Hebrew into Greek, by one of the descendants of the author, is altogether of the same kind with the Proverbs of Solomon; insomuch, that it originally bore the same title ( Mashalim ) as we learn from Jerome, who directly asserts, that he had seen the book in Hebrew  491 ; and I see no reason why his assertion should not relate to the original Hebrew copy, rather than to any Syriac version. However this may be, it is clear even from the Greek translation, which we have, that the book in every respect resembles the Proverbs of Solomon, as nearly as an imitation can resemble an original. There is a great similarity in the matter, the sentiments, and the diction; the complexion of the style, and the construction of the periods, are quite the same; so that I cannot entertain a doubt, that the author actually adopted the same mode of versification, whatever it was, if we can admit that any knowledge of the Hebrew metres was extant at the time when he is supposed to have written. For all that we are able to conjecture on this head we are indebted to the great fidelity of the translator, which is abundantly manifested in every part of the work. He seems indeed not at all to have affected the elegancies of the Greek language, but to have performed his duty with the most religious regard to the Hebrew idiom; he not only exhibits faithfully the sentiments, but seems even to have numbered the words, and exactly to have preserved their order; so that, were it literally and accurately to be re-translated, I have very little doubt that, for the most part, the original diction would be recovered. If any person will make the experiment on a small scale, he will readily discern the perfect coincidence of this composition with the most ancient specimens of the Didactic Poetry of the Hebrews; so exact indeed is the agreement both in form and character, that the reader might, without much difficulty, be persuaded, that he was perusing the compositions of another Solomon. This author is however an imitator chiefly of the former part of the book of Proverbs: for there is more connexion and order in the sentiments; the style is also more highly coloured, and abounds more in imagery and figures than the Didactic Poetry of the Hebrews in general requires. As an instance, I need only mention that admirable personification of Wisdom exhibited by him, in which he has so happily adopted the manner of his great predecessor  492 . The Wisdom of Solomon is also composed in imitation of that prince of didactic writers, but with a degree of success very unequal indeed to that of the Son of Sirach. It is not, like the book which bears his name, a translation from the Hebrew, but is evidently the performance of some Hellenistic Jew, and originally written in Greek. The style is very unequal; it is often pompous and turgid, as well as tedious and diffuse, and abounds in epithets, directly contrary to the practice of the Hebrews; it is however sometimes temperate, poetical and sublime. The construction is occasionally sententious, and tolerably accurate in that respect, so as to discover very plainly that the author had the old Hebrew poetry for his model, though he fell far short of its beauty and sublimity. The economy of the work is still more faulty; he continues the prayers of Solomon from the ninth chapter to the very end of the book; and they consequently take up more than one-half of the whole. But beside the tediousness of such an harangue, he indulges in too great a subtilty of disquisition upon abstruse subjects, and mingles many things very foreign to the nature of an address to the Deity: and after all, the subject itself is brought to no perfect conclusion. On these accounts I agree with those critics, who suppose this book to be a much more modern production than that of the Son of Sirach, and to have been composed in a less enlightened age. That I may not dismiss the subject without exhibiting a specimen of some complete poem of the kind, such as I have hitherto given, I shall add to this Lecture a translation of a part of Ecclesiasticus, namely, that elegant personification of Wisdom I lately mentioned; in which I have endeavoured as much as possible to preserve, or rather restore, the form and character of the original Hebrew  493 . "Wisdom shall praise her own spirit, And shall glory in the midst of her people: In the congregation of the Most High shall she open her mouth, And in the presence of his power shall she glory. I proceeded out of the mouth of the Most High; And as a mist I covered the earth. I dwelt above on high, And my throne was in the pillar of a cloud. I compassed the circuit of the heavens alone, And walked in the depth of the abyss. In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth, And in every people, and every nation I obtained a possession: With all these I sought rest, And in whose inheritance shall I abide? Then the Creator of all things commanded me, And he that created me fixed my tabernacle: And said, let thy dwelling be in Jacob, And in Israel thine inheritance. Before the world he created me, from the beginning; And I shall never cease. In the tabernacle of holiness I served before him; And so was I established in Sion. Thus in the beloved city he caused me to rest, And over Jerusalem was my power: I took root in an honourable people, In the portion of the inheritance of Jehovah . As a cedar in Lebanon was I exalted, And as a cypress on the mountains of Hermon. As a palm-tree in Gaddi was I exalted, And as plants of roses in Jericho: As a fair olive in a pleasant field, And as a plane-tree I was exalted above the waters; As cinnamon, and as a mass of ointment I yielded fragrance; And as choice myrrh I breathed forth a pleasant odour, As galbanum, and onyx, and storax, And as the vapour of frankincense in the tabernacle. I, as the turpentine-tree, sent out my branches, And my branches are the branches of glory and favour. I, as the vine, blossomed forth a pleasant smell, And my flowers are the embryoes of honour and wealth. Come unto me all ye that desire me, And with my productions be filled: For my remembrance is sweeter than honey, And my possession than the comb of the bees. They that eat me shall yet be hungry; And they that drink me shall yet be thirsty. He that obeyeth me shall not be ashamed, And those that act according to me shall not sin. All these are in the book of the covenant of God most high; The law which Moses commanded, An inheritance for the generations of Jacob. Wisdom filleth like Pishon, And like Hiddekel in the month Abib. She maketh the understanding to overflow like Euphrates; And as Jordan in the days of harvest. She sendeth forth instruction as the river  494 And as Gihon in the days of the vintage. The first man was not perfect in the knowledge of her, Neither shall the last search her out: For her thoughts are more extensive than the sea, And her counsels than the vast abyss. I came forth also as a brook from a river, And as a stream in Paradise welled from its fountain. I said I will water my garden, And I will abundantly water my furrow; And behold, my brook became a river, And my river a sea. For I will beam forth instruction as the morning, I will make it to shine afar off: For I will pour out doctrine as prophecy, And bequeath it to all generations for ever. Behold I have not laboured for myself alone, But for all who inquire after the truth  495 CHARACTERISTICS OF WHICH ARE SWEETNESS AND ELEGANCE. Lyric Poetry originated from the most jocund and pleasing affections of the human mind.---The most ancient species of poetry, and almost coeval with human nature itself.---Particularly cultivated by the Hebrews.---The manner, introduced by David, of singing their odes highly magnificent.--- The general character of this species of poetry: its principal distinctions.---The first character of the Ode, sweetness. ---What passions and affections it is intended to express: examples from the Psalms.---The cxxxiiid Psalm in English verse . THOSE compositions which were intended for music, whether vocal alone, or accompanied with instruments, obtained among the Hebrews the appellation of Shir , among the Greeks that of Od e ; and both these words have exactly the same power and signification. The Hebrew word, as well as the Greek, appears in course of time to have been appropriated to denote a particular form and species of poetry, with this difference however, that it is occasionally used with greater latitude. The ode is in its nature sufficiently expressive of its origin. It was the offspring of the most vivid, and the most agreeable passions of the mind, of love, joy, and admiration. If we consider man on his first creation, such as the Sacred Writings represent him; in perfect possession of reason and speech; neither ignorant of his own nor of the divine nature, but fully conscious of the goodness, majesty, and power of God; not an unobservant spectator of the beautiful fabric of the universe; is it not probable, that on the contemplation of these objects, his heart would glow with gratitude and love? And is it not probable, that the effect of such an emotion would be an effusion of praise to his Great Creator, accompanied with a suitable energy and exaltation of voice? Such indeed were the sensations experienced by the author of that most beautiful Psalm, in which the whole creation is invited to celebrate the glory of the most high God: "Praise Jehovah from the heavens; Praise him in the heights: Praise him all his angels; Praise him all his hosts  496 ." This hymn is, therefore, most elegantly imitated, and put into the mouth of Adam by our countryman Milton  497 , who is justly accounted the next in sublimity to those poets, who wrote under the influence of divine inspiration. Indeed we scarcely seem to conceive rightly of that original and perfect state of man, unless we assign him some of the aids of harmony and poetical expression, to enable him to testify in terms becoming the dignity of the subject, his devout affections towards his infinite Creator. Without carrying our researches, however, to objects so remote from human information, if we appeal only to the common testimony of history, we shall find that, among every people not utterly barbarous, the use of music and poetry in the celebration of their religious mysteries, has prevailed from the first periods of society. Of all that sacred melody, which Plato informs us was sometimes established by the solemn sanction of legal authority  498 , he assigns the first rank to that which assumed the form of addresses to the Deity, and was distinguished by the appellation of Hymns. In all the Latin poetry, there is nothing that can boast equal antiquity with the Salian poems of Numa, composed by that wise and learned monarch on the first institution of his religious rites, and sung by the Salii, whom Dionysius styles "the chorus of the Gods of War  499 ," with solemn dancing and other religious ceremonies. There is scarcely any necessity to mention, that the most ancient of all poems extant (those I mean of which the date is ascertained, and which deserve the name of poems) is the thanksgiving Ode of Moses on passing the Red Sea, the most perfect in its kind, and the true and genuine effusion of the joyful affections. Thus the origin of the ode may be traced into that of poetry itself, and appears to be coeval with the commencement of religion, or more properly the creation of man 500 . The Hebrews cultivated this kind of poetry above every other, and therefore may well be supposed to have been peculiarly excellent in it. It was usual in every period of that nation to celebrate in songs of joy their gratitude to God, their Saviour, for every fortunate event, and particularly for success in war. Hence the triumphal odes of Moses, of Deborah, of David. The schools of the prophets were also, in all probability, coeval with the republic; and were certainly antecedent to the monarchy by many years: there, as we have already seen, the youth, educated in the prophetic discipline, applied themselves, among other studies, particularly to sacred poetry, and celebrated the praises of Almighty God in Lyric compositions, accompanied with music. Under the government of David, however, the arts of music and poetry were in their most flourishing state. By him no less than four thousand singers or musicians were appointed from among the Levites  501 , under two hundred and eighty-eight principal singers, or leaders of the band, and distributed into twenty-four companies, who officiated weekly by rotation in the temple, and whose whole business was to perform the sacred hymns; the one part chanting or singing, and the other playing upon different instruments  502 . The chief of these were Asaph, Heman, and Iduthun, who also, as we may presume from the titles of the Psalms, were composers of hymns  503 . From so very splendid an establishment, so far surpassing every other appointment of the kind, some reasonable conjectures may be formed concerning the original dignity and grandeur of the Hebrew Ode. We must remember too, that we at present possess only some ruins as it were of that magnificent fabric, deprived of every ornament, except that splendour and elegance, which, notwithstanding the obscurity that antiquity has cast over them, still shine forth in the sentiments and language. Hence, in treating of the Hebrew ode, we must be content to omit entirely what relates to the sacred music, and the nature of the instruments which accompanied the vocal performance; though there is the utmost probability, that these circumstances were not without their influence, as far as respects the form and construction of the different species of ode. Our information upon these subjects is, indeed, so very scanty, that I esteem it safer to be silent altogether concerning them, than to imitate the example of some of the learned, who after saying much, have, in fact, said nothing. I shall therefore proceed to a brief inquiry into the general nature and properties of this species of poetry; and after that, we shall be better qualified to judge of those specimens which have been transmitted to us by the Hebrew writers. Of all the different forms of poetical composition, there is none more agreeable, harmonious, elegant, diversified and sublime than the ode; and these qualities are displayed in the order, sentiments, imagery, diction, and versification. The principal beauty of an ode consists in the order and arrangement of the subject; but this excellence, while it is easily felt, is difficult to be described, for there is this peculiarity attending it, that the form of the ode is by no means confined to any certain rule for the exact and accurate distribution of the parts. It is lively and unconstrained: when the subject is sublime, it is impetuous, bold, and sometimes might almost deserve the epithet licentious as to symmetry and method: but even in this case, and uniformly in every other, a certain facility and ease must pervade the whole, which may afford at least the appearance of unaffected elegance, and seem to prefer nature to art. This appearance is best preserved by an exordium plain, simple, and expressive; by a display and detail of incidents and sentiments rising delicately and artfully from each other, yet without any appearance of art; and by a conclusion not pointed or epigrammatic, but finishing by a gentle turn of the sentiment in a part where it is least expected, and sometimes as it were by chance  504 . Thus it is not the metre or versification which constitutes this species of composition; for unless all these circumstances be adverted to, it is plain that whatever be the merit of the production, it cannot with any propriety be termed an ode. Many of the odes of Horace are entirely in this form, as well as almost all of those few which our countryman Hannes has left behind him. There are two Lyric Poems in the Sylvae of Papinius Statius  505 , of which the versification is full, sonorous, and flowing; the sentiments elegant; the diction, if not highly polished, yet ardent and glowing; on the whole, however, the form, the grace, the express manner of the ode is wanting. The sentiments and imagery must be suitable to the nature of the subject and the composition, which is varied and unconfined by strict rule or method. On familiar subjects they will be sprightly, florid, and agreeable; on sublime topics, solemn, bold, and vivid; on every subject, highly elegant, expressive, and diversified. Imagery from natural objects is peculiarly adapted to the ode; historical common-places may also be admitted, as well as descriptions lively but short, and (when it rises to any uncommon strain of sublimity) frequent personifications. The diction must be choice and elegant, it must be also luminous, clear, and animated; it must possess some elegancies peculiar to itself, and be as distinct from the common language of poetry, as the form and fashion of the production is from the general cast of poetical composition. In this that happiness of expression, for which Horace is so justly celebrated, wholly consists. A sweetness and variety in the versification is indispensible, according to the nature of the language, or as the infinite diversity of subjects may require. It is much to be lamented, that in treating of the Hebrew ode, we must of necessity be silent concerning the numbers or versification, which (though we are almost totally ignorant of its nature and principles) we have the utmost reason to suppose was accommodated to the music, and agreeable to the genius of the language  506 . In every other respect, as the force and elegance of the language, the beauty and dignity of the sentiments and imagery, the different graces and excellencies of order and arrangement, I shall not hesitate to prefer the Hebrew writers to the Lyric poets of every other nation. But lest we should dubiously wander in so extensive a field, it will be proper to prescribe some kind of limit to our course, which may be conveniently done, by distributing all the diversities of this species of composition into three general classes. Of the first class the general characteristic will be sweetness, of the last sublimity; and between these we may introduce one of a middle nature, as partaking of the properties of both 507 . The qualities which may be accounted common to all the three classes, are variety and elegance. Although the Lyric Poetry of the Hebrews is always occupied upon serious subjects, nor ever descends to that levity which is admitted into that of other nations, the character of sweetness is by no means inconsistent with it. The sweetness of the Hebrew ode consists in the gentle and tender passions which it excites; in the gay and florid imagery, and in the chaste and unostentatious diction which it employs. The passions which it generally affects are those of love, tenderness, hope, cheerfulness, and pensive sorrow. In the sixty-third Psalm the royal Prophet, supposed to be then an exile in the wilderness, expresses most elegantly the sentiments of tenderness and love. The voice of grief and complaint is tempered with the consolations of hope in the eightieth Psalm: and the ninety-second consists wholly of joy, which is not the less fincere, because it is not excessive. The sweetness of all these in composition, sentiment, diction, and arrangement, has never been equalled by the finest productions of all the Heathen Muses and Graces united. Though none of the above are deficient in imagery, I must confess I have never met with any image so truly pleasing and delightful as the following description of the Deity in the character of a shepherd: "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want: In tender grass he giveth me to lie down; He guideth me to streams that gently flow  508 ." How graceful and animated is that rich and flourishing picture of nature, which is exhibited in the sixty-fifth Psalm. When the Prophet, with a fertility of expression correspondent to the subject, praises the beneficence of the Deity in watering the earth and making it fruitful. On a sublime subject also, but still one of the gay and agreeable kind, I mean the inauguration of Solomon, which is celebrated in the seventy-second Psalm, there is such variety and beauty of imagery, such a splendour of diction, such elegance in the composition, that I believe it will be impossible in the whole compass of literature, sacred or profane, to find such an union of sublimity with sweetness and grace. These few select examples of the elegant and beautiful in Lyric composition, I have pointed out for your more attentive consideration; and I am of opinion, that in all the treasures of the Muses you will seek in vain for models more perfect. I will add one other specimen, which, if I am not mistaken, is expressive of the true Lyric form and character; and compresses in a small compass all the merits and elegance incidental to that species of composition. It is, if I may be allowed to use the expression of a very polite writer, A drop from Helicon, a flower Cull'd from the Muse's favourite bower  509 . The Psalmist contemplating the harmony which pervaded the solemn assembly of the people, at the celebration of one of their festivals, expresses himself nearly as follows: "How blest the sight, the joy how sweet, When brothers join'd with brothers meet In bands of mutual love! Less sweet the liquid fragrance, shed On Aaron's consecrated head, Ran trickling from above: And reach'd his beard, and reach'd his vest: Less sweet the dews on Hermon's breast, Or Sion's hill descend: That hill has God with blessings crown'd, There promis'd grace that knows no bound, And life that knows no end  511 ." The Lyric Poetry of the intermediate or mixed style consists of an union of sweetness and sublimity.---The xcist and lxxxist Psalms explained and critically illustrated.---Of the digressions of the Hebrew poets, also of Pindar; not upon the same principle.---A criticism upon the lxxviith Psalm. ---The xixth Psalm in English verse . HAVING dismissed the subject of the more beautiful species of ode, in order to proceed by proper stages to what I deem the summit of excellence and sublimity in the Lyric Poetry of the Hebrews, it will be necessary to rest a while, and to bestow some little attention upon that middle style of composition, to which I adverted as constituting one of the grand divisions of this order of poems. This again may be considered as admitting of a subdivision, as including both those Lyric compositions, in which sweetness and sublimity are so uniformly blended, that every part of the poem may be said to partake equally of both; and those, in which these qualities separately occur in such a manner, that the complexion of the poem is altogether changeable and diversified. Of each species I shall endeavour to produce an example or two. The subject of the ninety-first Psalm is the security, the succes, and the rewards of piety. The exordium exhibits the pious man placing all his dependance upon Almighty God: "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High; Who lodgeth under the shadow of the Omnipotent; Who faith to Jehovah , thou art my hope and my fortress! My God, in whom I trust  512 :--- And immediately leaving the sentence unfinished, he apostrophizes to the same person, whom he had been describing: "He indeed shall deliver thee From the snare of the fowler, from the destroying pestilence." The imagery that follows is beautiful and diversified, and at the same time uncommonly solemn and sublime: "With his feathers will he cover thee, And under his wings shalt thou find protection: His truth shall be thy shield and thy defence. Thou shalt not fear from the terror by night; From the arrow that flieth by day; From the pestilence that walketh in darkness  513 ; From the destruction that wasteth at noon. A thousand shall fall at thy side; And ten thousand at thy right-hand: To thee it shall not approach." How excellent also are the succeeding images, the guard of angels, the treading under foot the fiercest and most formidable animals: and afterwards, that sudden but easy and elegant change of the persons  514 ? "Because he hath loved me, therefore will I deliver him: I will exalt him, for he hath known my name." If any reader will carefully weigh and consider the nature and dignity of this imagery, having due respect at the same time to the principles of the mystical allegory, I am persuaded he will agree with me, that something of a mystical design is concealed under the literal meaning of this Psalm. Without a question, the pious person  515 , the king, or high-priest perhaps, who in the literal sense is the principal character of the poem, is meant in reality to represent some greater and sublimer personage. But leaving this part of the subject to the investigation of the divine, I submit it to any critic of true taste and discernment, whether the third ode of the fourth book of Horace (the beauty of which has been justly celebrated, and which bears a great resemblance to that under our consideration) is not greatly excelled by the sacred poet, as well in grace and elegance, as in force and dignity  516 . The eighty-first Psalm will serve as another example upon this occasion, being pervaded by an exquisite union of sublimity and sweetness. It is an ode composed for the feast of Trumpets in the first new moon of the civil year 517 . The exordium contains an exhortation to celebrate the praises of the Almighty with music and song, and (as is frequent in these productions of the Hebrews) is replete with animation and joy, even to exultation: "Sing unto God our strength; A song of triumph to the God of Jacob." The different instruments of music are named, as is common in the Lyric compositions of all other nations: "Take the psaltery, bring hither the timbrel, The pleasant harp, with the lute." The trumpet is particularly alluded to, because the solemn use of it on their great festivals was prescribed by the Mosaic law. The commemoration of the giving of the law, associated with the sound of the trumpet (which was the signal of liberty)  518 introduces, in a manner spontaneously, the miseries of the Egyptian bondage, the recovery of their freedom, and the communication with God upon mount Sinai (the awfulness of which is expressed in a very few words, "the secret place of thunder") and finally the contention with their Creator at the waters of Meribah. The mention of Meribah introduces another idea, namely, the ingratitude and contumacy of the Israelites, who appear to have been ever unmindful of the favours and indulgence of their heavenly Benefactor. The remainder of the ode, therefore, contains an affectionate expostulation of God with his people, a confirmation of his former promises, and a tender complaint, that his favourable intentions towards them have been so long prevented by their disobedience. Thus the object and end of this poem appears to be an exhortation to obedience from the consideration of the paternal love, the beneficence, and the promises of the Deity; and we have seen with how much art, elegance, variety, and ingenuity, this is accomplished. In order to complete the beauty of this composition, the conclusion is replete with all the graces of sentiment, imagery, and diction. The sudden and frequent change of persons is remarkable; but it is by no means harsh or obscure. Some allowance is however to be made for the Hebrew idiom, as well as for the state of the author's mind: he is not under the influence of art but of nature; through the impetuosity of passion, therefore, his transitions are frequent from figure and allusion to plain language, and back again with a kind of desultory inconstancy. In the last Lecture I treated in general of the disposition and arrangement of Lyric composition, and endeavoured, in some degree, to define its usual symmetry and outline. But on abstruse and difficult subjects, example is of more avail than the utmost accuracy of description. To him, therefore, who wishes to form a correct idea of this kind of poem, I will venture to recommend the Psalm which we have just examined; not doubting, that if he can make himself master of its general character, genius, and arrangement, he will feel perfectly satisfied concerning the nature and form of a perfect ode. In both these specimens, the style and cadence of the whole poem flows in one equal and uniform tenour; but there are others, which are more changeable and diversified, more unequal both in style and sentiment. These, although they occasionally incline to the character of sweetness, and occasionally to that of sublimity, may nevertheless (though upon a different principle) be properly classed among the odes of this intermediate style. Such are those which, from a mild and gentle exordium, rise gradually to sublimity, both in the subject and sentiments; such also are those, which commence in a mournful strain, and conclude with exultation and triumph. Such, in fine, are all those in which the style or matter is in any respect diversified and unequal. This inequality of style is perfectly consistent with the nature of Lyric composition; for variety is one of the greatest ornaments, if not essentials, of the ode. Since, therefore, for the sake of variety, Lyric writers in particular are indulged in the liberty of frequent digressions; that boldness in thus diverging from the subject is not only excuseable, but on many occasions is really worthy of commendation. Possibly a brief inquiry into the nature of those liberties which the Hebrew poets have allowed themselves in this respect, or rather into the general method and pinciples of their Lyric compositions, will not be thought altogether unseasonable in this place. By far the greater part of the Lyric Poetry of the Hebrews, is occupied wholly in the celebration of the power and goodness of Almighty God, in extolling his kindness and beneficence to his chosen people, and in imploring his assistance and favour in time of adversity: in other words, the usual subjects of these odes are so connected with every part of the Sacred History, as to afford ample scope for those digressions which are most pleasing, and most congenial to this species of composition. Thus, whether the theme be gay or mournful; whether the events which they celebrate be prosperous or adverse; whether they return thanks to God their deliverer for assistance in trouble, or with the humility of suppliants acknowledge the justice of the divine correction; the memory of former times spontaneously occurs, and a variety of incidents and circumstances, of times, of seasons, of countries, of nations, all the miracles in Egypt, in the wilderness, in Judea, are presented to their recollection: and all these so naturally connect with the subject, that whatever of ornament is deduced from them, so far from appearing foreign to it, seems rather an essential part of the principal matter. It may, therefore, be with modesty asserted of the Hebrew ode, that from the nature of the subjects, which it usually embraces, it is possessed of so easy an access to some of the most elegant sources of poetical imagery, and has consequently so many opportunities for agreeable digression; that with unbounded freedom and uncommon variety, are united the most perfect order, and the most pleasing uniformity. The happy boldness of Pindar in his digressions is deservedly celebrated; but as he was very differently situated from those poets who are at present under our consideration, so the nature of his subject, and the principles of his composition, are altogether different from theirs; and a different reason is to be assigned for the liberties which he assumed in his Lyric productions. We are in no want of materials to enable us to form a perfect judgment of the genius of Pindar; there are about forty of his odes remaining, and the subject of them all is exactly similar. They are all composed in celebration of some victorious chief, whose praise is heightened and illustrated by the circumstances of his birth, ancestry, manners, or country. Since, therefore, this poet was professedly the herald of the Olympic conquerors, unless he had determined to assume great liberty in treating of those topics, and even on some occasions to have recourse to topics very foreign to the principal subject, his poems must have been little better than a stale and disgusting repetition. His apology, therefore, is necessity, and on this ground he has obtained not only pardon but commendation; and many things, which in another poet could neither be defended nor probably endured, in Pindar have been approved and extolled. Lest I should seem to assert rashly on this occasion, I will explain myself by an example. The third of the Pythian odes is inscribed to Hiero, at that time labouring under a grievous and chronical disease. The poet taking advantage of the opportunity to impart a degree of variety to his poem, introduces it with a solemn address, invoking the medical aid of Chiron or Æsculapius, if it be possible for them to revisit the earth. But surely, on such an occasion, it would be excuseable in no writer but Pindar to expend more than one hundred verses, that is, above half the poem, on the history of Æsculapius. Nor indeed could we easily pardon it in Pindar himself, but from the consideration that he had already written an ode (the fourth) in praise of the same Hiero, upon a victory obtained in the Olympic games. But we are willing to excuse the boldness of a poet, who, even with a degree of rash impetuosity, escapes from such narrow limits into a more spacious field. It is therefore no discommendation of the Hebrew poets to say, that in this respect they are materially different from Pindar; nor does it detract from the merit of Pindar to assert, that, from the more favourable circumstances of the Hebrews, their Lyric Poetry is more genuine and perfect. The seventy-seventh Psalm will afford some illustration of what has been remarked concerning the nature and economy of the Hebrew ode. This Psalm is composed in what I call the intermediate style, and is of that diversifed and unequal kind which ascends from a cool and temperate exordium to a high degree of sublimity. The Prophet, oppressed with a heavy weight of affliction, displays the extreme dejection and perturbation of his soul, and most elegantly and pathetically describes the conflicts and internal contests to which he is subjected, before he is enabled to rise from the depths of woe to any degree of hope or confidence. In the character of a suppliant he first pours forth his earnest prayers to the God of his hope: "I listed up my voice unto God and cried; I listed up my voice unto God, that he should hear me." But even prayers afford him no sufficient consolation. He next endeavours to mitigate his sorrow by the remembrance of former times; but this, on the contrary, only seems to exaggerate his sufferings, by the comparison of his present adversity with his former happiness, and extorts from him the following pathetic expostulation: "Will the Lord reject me for ever? And will he be reconciled no more? Is his mercy eternally ceased; Doth his promise fail from generation to generation? Hath God forgotten to be merciful? Or hath he in anger shut up his pity?" Again, recollecting the nature of the divine dispensations in chastising man, "the change of the right-hand of the Most High;" in other words, the different methods by which the Almighty seeks the salvation of his people, appearing frequently to frown upon and persecute those "in whom he delighteth:" reconsidering also the vast series of mercies which he had bestowed upon his chosen people; the miracles which he had wrought in their favour, in a word, the goodness, the holiness, the power of the great Ruler of the universe; with all the ardour of gratitude and affection, he bursts forth into a strain of praise and exultation. In this passage we are at a loss which to admire most, the ease and grace with which the digression is made, the choice of the incidents, the magnificence of the imagery, or the force and elegance of the diction. "Thy way, O God, is in holiness; What God is great as our God? Thou art the God that doest wonders; Thou hast made known thy strength among the nations: With thy arm hast thou redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. The waters saw thee, O God! The waters saw thee, and trembled; The depths also were troubled. The clouds overflowed with water; The skies sent forth thunder; Thine arrows also went abroad: The voice of thy thunder was in the atmosphere; Thy lightnings enlightened the world, The earth trembled, and was distrubed." The other example, to which I shall refer you on this occasion, is composed upon quite a different plan; for it declines gradually from an exordium uncommonly splendid and sublime, to a gentler and more moderate strain, to the softest expressions of piety and devotion. The whole composition abounds with great variety of both sentiment and imagery. You will, from these circumstances, almost conjecture that I am alluding to the nineteenth Psalm. The glory of God is demonstrated in his works both of nature and providence. By exhibiting it, however, in an entire state, though in modern verse, you will more readily perceive the order, method, and arrangement of this beautiful composition. 519 "God the heavens aloud proclaim Through their wide-extended frame, And the firmament each hour Speaks the wonders of his power: Day to the succeeding day Joys the notice to convey, And the nights, in ceaseless round, Each to each repeats the sound; Prompt, without or speech or tongue, In his praise to form the song. Pleas'd to hear their voice extend Far as to her utmost end; Earth the heaven-taught knowledge boasts Through her many-languag'd coasts. While the sun, above her head, Sees his tabernacle spread; And, from out his chamber bright, Like a bridegroom springs to sight: See him, with gigantic pace, Joyous run his destin'd race. Now, to farthest regions borne, Onward speed, and now return; And to all, with welcome ray, Life and genial warmth convey. Warmth and life each thankful heart Feels thy law, Great God! impart; Clear from every spot it shines, And the guilt-stain'd thought refines; Truth's firm base its same upholds, While it mysteries unfolds; Which the childlike mind explores, And to heavenly science soars. Prest with sorrows, doubts, and fears, What like this the spirit chears? What so perfect, what so pure? What to Reason's eye obscure Can such wond'rous light afford, As the dictates of thy word? Where thy fear its fruit matures, (Fruit that endless years endures) There the mind, to vice a foe, Pants thy blest decrees to know; And (its will to thine subdu'd) Owns them wise, and just, and good; Nor can gold such worth acquire From the sev'nth exploring fire; Nor the labour of the bees Can in sweetness vie with these: Taught by them, thy servant's breast Joys the blessings to attest, Heap'd on those, whose hearts sincere, Learn thy precepts to revere. Best Instructor, from thy ways, Who can tell how oft he strays? Purge me from the guilt that lies Wrapt within my heart's disguise; Let me thence, by thee renew'd, Each presumptous sin exclude: So my lot shall ne'er be join'd With the men whose impious mind, Fearless of thy just command, Braves the vengeance of thy hand. Let my tongue, from error free, Speak the words approv'd by thee; To thy all observing eyes Let my thoughts accepted rise: While I thus thy name adore, And thy healing grace implore, Blest Redeemer bow thine ear, God my strength, propitious hear!" The third species of the Hebrew Ode, the characteristic of which is sublimity.---This sublimity results from three sources.---From the general form and arrangement of the poem exemplified in the lth and xxivth Psalm.--- From the greatness of the sentiments and the force of the language.--- The Ode of Moses on passing the Red Sea explained and illustrated.---The brevity of the Hebrew style.---The xxix th Psalm in English verse . SUBLIMITY was mentioned as the characteristic of a third species of the Hebrew ode. But having already treated very copiously of the sublime in general, both as the effect of sentiment and expression, our present investigation must be confined to that which is peculiar to this species of poetry. Now the sublimity of Lyric compositions results either from the plan, the order and arrangement of the poem; or from those common sources which I formerly specified, the sentiments and the style; or, in some cases, from an union of all, when an aggregate perfection is produced from the beauty of the arrangement, the dignity of the sentiments, and the splendour of the diction. I shall endeavour to exhibit a few examples in each kind; and indeed this subject is every way deserving our attention, since it relates to what may be esteemed the perfection of the Hebrew poetry, for its chief commendation is sublimity, and its sublimest species is the ode. Let us therefore consider in the first place what degree of sublimity the mere form and disposition of a Lyric Poem can impart to a subject not in itself sublime. We have an example of this in the fiftieth Psalm; the subject of which is of the didactic kind, and belongs to the moral part of theology. It is at first serious and practical, with very little of sublimity or splendour: it sets forth, that the divine favour is not to be conciliated by sacrifices, or by any of the external rites and services of religion, but rather by sincere piety, and by the devout effusions of a grateful heart: and yet, that even these will not be accepted without the strictest attention to justice, and every practical virtue. It consists therefore of two parts: in the first the devout, but ignorant and superstitious worshipper is reproved; and in the second the hypocritical pretender to virtue and religion. Each part of the subject, if we regard the imagery and the diction only, is treated rather with variety and elegance, than with sublimity; but if the general effect, if the plot and machinery of the whole be considered, scarcely any thing can appear more truly magnificent. The great Author of nature, by a solemn decree, convokes the whole human race, to be witness of the judgment which he is about to execute upon his people; the august tribunal is established in Sion: " Jehovah , God of gods, Hath spoken, and hath summoned the earth, From the rising to the setting of the sun: From Sion, from the perfection of beauty, God hath shined." The majesty of God is depicted by imagery assumed from the descent upon mount Sinah, which, as I formerly observed, is one of the common-places that supply ornaments of this kind: "Our God shall come, and shall not be silent; A fire shall devour before him, And a mighty whirlwind shall surround him." The heavens and the earth are invoked as witnesses, which is a pompous form of expression common with the Hebrew writers  520 : "He shall call the heavens from on high; And the earth to the judgment of his people." At length the Almighty is personally introduced pronouncing his sentence, which constitutes the remainder of the ode; and the admirable sublimity and splendour of the exordium is continued through the whole. There is in Horace an ode upon a similar subject  521 , and it is not enough to say, that he has treated it in his usual manner, with elegance and variety, for he has done more than could be expected from a person unenlightened by divine truth, he has treated it with piety and solemnity. But that high degree of sublimity, to which the Psalmist rises upon such occasions, is only to be attained by the Hebrew Muse; for it is a truth universally acknowledged, that no religion whatever, no poetic history is provided with a store of imagery so striking and so magnificent, so capable of embellishing a scene, which may be justly accounted the most sublime that the human imagination is able to comprehend. The next example, which I shall produce, will be found in some measure different from the former, inasmuch as the subject itself is possessed of the highest dignity and splendour, though still no inconsiderable part of the sublimity is to be attributed to the general plan and arrangement of the poem. The induction of th ark of God to mount Sion by David, gave occasion to the twenty-fourth Psalm  522 . The removal of the ark was celebrated in a great assembly of the people, and with suitable splendour during every part of the ceremony. The Levites led the procession, accompanied by a great variety of vocal and instrumental music; and this Ode appears to have been sung to the people when they arrived at the summit of the mountain. The exordium is expressive of the supreme and infinite dominion of God, arising from the right of creation: "The earth is Jehovah's , and the fulness thereof; The world and all that inhabit therein. For upon the seas hath he founded it, And upon the floods hath he established it." How astonishing the favour and condescension! how extraordinary the testimony of his love, when he selected from his infinite dominion a peculiar seat, and a people for himself! What a copious return of gratitude, of holiness, of righteousness, and of all human virtues, does such an obligation demand! "Behold," says Moses, addressing the Israelites, "The heaven, and the heaven of heavens, is Jehovah's , thy God, the earth also, and all that it containeth. Only he had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and their posterity after them, and he chose you above all people as it is this day  523 ." Such is evidently the reasoning of David in the following passage, though the chain of argument is not quite so directly displayed: "Who shall ascend unto the mountain of Jehovah ; And who shall stand in the seat of his holiness? He whose hands are innocent, and whose heart is pure: Who hath not put his trust in vanity  524 , Nor sworn for the purpose of deceit. He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah , And righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation that seeketh him; That seeketh the face of the God of Jacob  525 ." Thus far is expressive, on the one hand, of the infinite goodness and condescension of God to the children of Israel; and on the other hand, of their indispensible obligation to piety and virtue; since he had deigned to make their nation the peculiar seat of his miraculous providence, and to honour them with his actual presence. We may now conceive the procession to have arrived at the gates of the tabernacle. While the ark is brought in, the Levites, divided into two choirs, sing alternately the remainder of the Psalm. Indeed, it is not impossible that this mode of singing was pursued through every part of the Ode; but towards the conclusion the fact will not admit of a doubt. On the whole, whether we regard the subject, the imagery, or style of this composition, it will be found to possess a certain simple and unaffected (and therefore admirable) sublimity: "Lift up your heads, O ye gates! And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors  526 And the King of Glory shall enter. Who is this King of Glory? Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors! And the King of Glory shall enter. Who is this King of Glory? You will easily perceive, that the beauty and sublimity observable in this Psalm are of such a peculiar kind as to be perfectly adapted to the subject and the occasion, and to that particular solemnity for which it was composed. You will perceive too, that unless we have some respect to these points, the principal force and elegance will be lost; and even the propriety of the sentiments, the splendour of the diction, the beauty and order of the arrangement, will be almost totally obscured. If such be the state of the case in this single instance, it is surely not unreasonable to conclude, that it is not the only one which stands in need of the light of history to cast a splendour on its beauties. It is surely not unreasonable to infer, that much of the harmony, propriety, and elegance of the sacred poetry must pass unperceived by us, who can only form distant conjectures of the general design, but are totally ignorant of the particular application  527 . Thus of necessity much of the delicacy of sentiment, much of the felicity of allusion, and the force of expression, must, by the hand of time, be cast into shade; or rather I should say, totally suppressed and extinguished. The attentive reader will, indeed, frequently feel a want of information, concerning the author, the age, and the occasion of a poem; still more frequently will he find occasion to lament his own ignorance with respect to many facts and circumstances closely connected with the principal subject, and on which, perhaps, its most striking ornaments depend. This we experience in some degree in the admirable poem of Deborah; and this I seem to experience in the sixty-eighth Psalm, though it appears to have some affinity with the subject of that which we have just examined, since it adopts, in the place of an exordium, that well-known form of expression which was commonly made use of on the removal of the ark  528 : "Let God arise; let his enemies be scattered; And let those that hate him flee from his presence." But almost every part of this most noble poem is involved in an impenetrable darkness. It would otherwise have afforded a singular example of the true sublime; the scattered rays of which, breaking forth with difficulty through the thick clouds that surround it, we yet behold with a mixture of admiration and pleasure  529 . The most perfect example that I know of the other species of the sublime ode, which I pointed out (that I mean which possesses a sublimity dependant wholly upon the greatness of the conceptions, and the dignity of the language, without any peculiar excellence in the form and arrangement) is the thanksgiving ode of Moses, composed after passing the Red Sea  530 . Through every part of this poem the most perfect plainness and simplicity is maintained; there is nothing artificial, nothing laboured, either in respect to method or invention. Every part of it breathes the spirit of nature and of passion: joy, admiration, and love, united with piety and devotion, burst forth spontaneously in their native colours. A miracle of the most interesting nature to the Israelites is displayed. The sea divides, and the waters are raised into vast heaps on either side, while they pass over; but their enemies, in attempting to pursue, are overwhelmed by the reflux of the waves. These circumstances are all expressed in language suitable to the emotions which they produced, abrupt, fervid, concise, animated, with a frequent repetition of the same sentiments: "I will sing to Jehovah , for he is very highly exalted; The horse and the rider he hath o'erwhelmed in the sea." This constitutes the proem of the ode, and is also repeated occasionally by the female part of the band in the manner of a modern chorus, being briefly expressive of the general subject. The same idea, however, occurs in several parts of the poem, with considerable variation in the language and figures: "The chariots of Pharoah and his forces he cast into the sea; And his chosen leaders were drowned in the Red Sea. The depths have covered them; They went down into the abyss as a stone." And again: "The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake; I will divide the spoil, my soul shall be satisfied  531 ; I will draw the sword, my hand shall destroy them. Thou didst blow with thy breath; the sea covered them: They sunk like lead in the great waters." Nor do even these repetitions satisfy the author: "Who is like unto thee among the gods, O Jehovah ! Who is like unto thee, glorious in sanctity! Fearful in praises, performing miracles! Thou extendedst thy right-hand, the earth swallowed them." In these examples is displayed all the genuine force of nature and passion, which the efforts of art will emulate in vain. Here we behold the passions struggling for vent, labouring with a copiousness of thought and a poverty of expression, and on that very account the more expressly displayed. To take a strict account of the sublimity of this ode, would be to repeat the whole. I will only remark one quality, which is indeed congenial to all the poetry of the Hebrews, but in this poem is more than usually predominant, I mean that brevity of diction which is so conducive to sublimity of style. Diffuse and exuberant expression generally detracts from the force of the sentiment; as in the human body, excessive corpulency is generally inconsistent with health and vigour. The Hebrews, if we contemplate any of their compositions as a whole, may be deemed full and copious; but if we consider only the constituent parts of any production, they will be found sparing in words, concise and energetic. They amplify by diversifying, by repeating, and sometimes by adding to the subject; therefore it happens, that it is frequently, on the whole, treated rather diffusely; but still every particular sentence is concise and nervous in itself. Thus it happens in general, that neither copiousness nor vigour is wanting. This brevity of style is in some measure to be attributed to the genius of the language, and in some measure to the nature of the Hebrew verse. The most literal versions therefore commonly fail in this respect, and consequently still less is to be expected from any poetical translations or imitations whatever. Most of those qualities and perfections, which have been the subject of this disquisition, will be found in a very high degree in the twenty-ninth Psalm. The supreme dominion of God, and the awfulness of his power, are demonstrated from the tremendous noise, and the astonishing force of the thunder, which the Hebrews, by a bold but very apt figure, denominate "the voice of the Most High." It is enough to say of it, that the sublimity of the matter is perfectly equalled by the unaffected energy of the style. "Sing, ye sons of might, O sing Praise to heaven's eternal king; Power and strength to him assign, And before his hallow'd shrine Yield the homage, that his name From a creature's lips may claim. Hark! his voice in thunder breaks; Hush'd to silence, while he speaks, Ocean's waves from pole to pole Hear the awful accents roll: See, as louder yet they rise, Echoing through the vaulted skies, Loftiest cedars lie o'erthrown, Cedars of steep Lebanon. See, uprooted from its seat, Trembling at the threat divine, Lebanon itself retreat; And Sirion haste its flight to join! See them like the heifer borne, Like the beast whose pointed horn Strikes with dread the sylvan train, Bound impetuous on the plain. Now the bursting clouds give way, And the vivid lightnings play; And the wilds by man untrod Hear, dismay'd, th' approaching God. Cades! o'er thy lonely waste, Oft the dreadful sounds have past: Oft his stroke the wood invades: Widow'd of their branchy shades Mightiest oaks its fury know  532 ; While the pregnant hind her throe Instant feels, and on the earth Trembling drops th' unfinish'd birth. Prostrate on the sacred floor Israel's sons his name adore. While his acts to every tongue Yields its argument of song. He the swelling surge commands; Fix'd his throne for ever stands; He his people shall increase, Arm with strength, and bless with peace." The sublime Ode, in which all the constituents of sublimity formerly specified are united.---The prophetic Ode of Moses, Deut . xxxii .---The triumphal Ode of Deborah; the Prayer of Habakkuk; the Fate of Tyranny, being a poetical imitation of the xivth chapter of Isaiah . BEFORE we conclude this disquisition concerning the Lyric Poetry of the Hebrews, it will be proper to produce a few specimens of that kind of ode, which derives sublimity from several united causes, from the diction, the sentiments, the form and conduct of the poem; and which accumulates, or in a manner condenses and combines all the beauties and elegancies of this style of composition. The poems to which I shall refer on this occasion, are too well known to require a minute explanation, and indeed almost too noble and perspicuous in themselves to admit of any illustration from criticism; it will therefore be sufficient to notice them in general terms, or, at most, briefly to recommend a few passages, which are perhaps so eminently beautiful as to deserve particular attention. The first instance I shall mention is that prophetic ode of Moses  533 , which contains a justification on the part of God against the Israelites, and an explanation of the nature and design of the divine judgments. The exordium is singularly magnificent; the plan and conduct of the poem is just, natural, and well accommodated to the subject, for it is almost in the order of an historical narration. It embraces a variety of the sublimest subjects and sentiments, it displays the truth and justice of God, his paternal love, and his unfailing tenderness to his chosen people; and on the other hand, their ungrateful and contumacious spirit. The ardour of the divine indignation, and the heavy denunciations of vengeance, are afterwards expressed in a remarkable personification, which is scarcely to be paralleled from all the choicest treasures of the Muses. The fervour of wrath is however tempered with the milder beams of lenity and mercy, and ends at last in promises and consolation. When I formerly treated of elevation of sentiment, of the impulse of the passions, of the force of imagery and diction, I could scarcely have avoided touching upon this poem, and drawing some of my examples from it  534 . Not to repeat these, or accumulate unnecessary matter, I will only add one remark, namely, that the subject and style of this poem bear so exact a resemblance to the prophetic as well as the Lyric compositions of the Hebrews, that it unites all the force, energy, and boldness of the latter, with the exquisite variety and grandeur of imagery so peculiar to the former  535 . Another specimen of the perfectly sublime Ode will be found in the triumphal Ode of Deborah  536 . This Poem consists of three parts: first, the exordium; next, a recital of the circumstances which preceded, and of those which accompanied the victory; lastly, a fuller description of the concluding event, the death of Sisera, and the disappointed hopes of his mother, which is embellished with all the choicest flowers of poetry. Of this latter part, I endeavoured to explain at large the principal beauties in a former lecture. About the middle of the poem, it must be confessed, some obscurities occur, and those not of a trivial nature, which impair the beauty of the composition; and what is worse, I fear they will scarcely admit of elucidation, unless we were possessed of some further historical lights. The exordium deserves a particular examination, as well for its native magnificence and sublimity, as because it will serve more completely to illustrate my remarks concerning the digressions of the Hebrew Ode. I observed, that the principal passages in the Sacred History, which in general constitute the materials of these digressions, are so connected with every subject of Sacred Poetry, that even in the most excentric excursions of the imagination, there is little danger of wandering from the main scope and design. The subject of this Ode is the triumph of the Israelites over their enemies through the divine assistance, and the establishment of their liberty. At the very opening of the poem this is proposed as the ground-work of it: and after inviting the kings and princes of the neighbouring nations to attend to this miracle of the divine goodness, the author proceeds to celebrate the praise of God, not commencing with the benefit so recently received, but with the prodigies formerly exhibited in Egypt: "O Jehovah , when thou wentest forth out of Seir, When thou proceededst from the plains of Edom; The earth was moved, the heavens dropped, The clouds also dropped water; The mountains melted from before the face of Jehovah , Sinah itself from before Jehovah , the God of Israel." The sudden introduction of such important incidents, breathes the free and fervid spirit of the Lyric Muse. There is however no defect in the connexion, nor does any degree of obscurity attend the comparison which is implied between that stupendous deliverance and the benefit so lately received. On the same principle the prayer of Habakkuk is constructed  537 ; and is a remarkable instance of that sublimity peculiar to the ode, and which is often the result of a bold but natural digression. The Prophet foreseeing the judgment of God, and the impending calamities, which were to be inflicted upon his nation by the hands of the Chaldeans, as well as the punishments, which the latter were themselves to undergo; partly struck with terror, partly cheered with hope, he beseeches Almighty God to hasten the redemption of his people: I have feared, O Jehovah , thy work. As the years  538 approach, thou hast shewn it: And in thy wrath hast remembered mercy." In this passage, the resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a similar deliverance through the power and assistance of God. With how much propriety, therefore, might the Prophet have continued his supplications to that all-powerful and all-merciful God; that, as he had formerly wrought so many miracles in favour of his people, he would afford them relief and consolation on the present occasion; and how efficacious a method would it have been, to confirm the fortitude of every pious person, to remind them, that he who had formerly manifested his infinite power in delivering the Israelites from their great afflictions, might, in proper time, employ the same means to rescue them from their present state of suffering? He however totally disregards the formality of this method, probably because he supposed all the above ideas would spontaneously occur to the reader; nor does he labour for access by slow and regular approaches to the sacred depository of the most splendid materials, but bursts into it at once, and by a sort of unexpected impulse: "God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran: His glory covered the heavens; And the earth was full of his praise." The Prophet, indeed, illustrates this subject throughout with equal magnificence; selecting from such an assemblage of miraculous incidents, the most noble and important, displaying them in the most splendid colours, and embellishing them with the sublimest imagery, figures, and diction, the dignity of which is so heightened and recommended by the superior elegance of the conclusion, that were it not for a few shades, which the hand of time has apparently cast over it in two or three passages, no composition of the kind would, I believe, appear more elegant or more perfect than this poem. I will add one remarkable example more of the perfectly sublime ode, which indeed it would be utterly unpardonable to overlook; I mean, the triumphal song of the Israelites on the destruction of Babylon. It is almost unnecessary to add, that it is in no respect unworthy of Isaiah, whom I cannot help esteeming the first of poets, as well for elegance as sublimity. Having formerly taken up a considerable portion of your time and attention in a minute investigation of its beauties, it is now presented in the modern form of a Lyric composition. "Oppression dies: the Tyrant falls: The golden City bows her walls! Jehovah breaks th' Avenger's rod. The Son of Wrath, whose ruthless hand Hurl'd Desolation o'er the land, Has run his raging race, has clos'd the scene of blood. Chiefs arm'd around behold their vanquish'd Lord; Nor spread the guardian shield, nor lift the loyal sword. He falls; and Earth again is free. Hark! at the call of Liberty, All Nature lifts the choral song. The Fir-trees, on the mountain's head, Rejoice thro' all their pomp of shade; The lordly Cedars nod on sacred Lebanon: Tyrant! they cry, since thy fell force is broke, Our proud heads pierce the skies, nor fear the woodman's stroke. Hell, from her gulph profound, Rouses at thine approach; and, all around, Her dreadful notes of preparation sound. See, at the awful call, Her shadowy Heroes all, Ev'n mighty Kings, the heirs of empire wide, Rising, with solemn state, and slow, From their sable thrones below, Meet, and insult thy pride. What, dost thou join our ghostly train, A flitting shadow light, and vain? Where is thy pomp, thy festive throng, Thy revel dance, and wanton song? Proud King! Corruption fastens on thy breast; And calls her crawling brood, and bids them share the feast. Oh Lucifer! thou radiant star; Son of the Morn; whose rosy car Flam'd foremost in the van of day: How art thou fall'n, thou King of Light! How fall'n from thy meridian height! Who said'st the distant poles shall hear me, and obey. High, o'er the stars, my sapphire throne shall glow, And, as Jehovah 's self, my voice the heav'ns shall bow. He spake, he died. Distain'd with gore, Beside yon yawning cavern hoar, See, where his livid corse is laid. The aged Pilgrim passing by, Surveys him long with dubious eye; And muses on his fate, and shakes his reverend head. Just heav'ns! is thus thy pride imperial gone? Is this poor heap of dust the King of Babylon? Is this the Man, whose nod Made the Earth tremble: whose terrific rod Levell'd her loftiest cities? Where He trod, Famine pursu'd, and frown'd; 'Till Nature groaning round, Saw her rich realms transform'd to deserts dry; While at his crouded prison's gate; Grasping the keys of Fate, Stood stern Captivity. Vain Man! behold thy righteous doom; Behold each neighb'ring monarch's tomb; The trophied arch, the breathing bust, The laurel shades their sacred dust; While thou, vile Out-cast, on this hostile plain, Moulder'st, a vulgar corse, among the vulgar slain. No trophied arch, no breathing bust, Shall dignify thy trampled dust: No laurel flourish o'er thy grave. For why, proud King, thy ruthless hand Hurl'd Desolation o'er the land, And crush'd the subject race, whom kings are born to save: Eternal Infamy shall blast thy name, And all thy sons shall share their impious Father's shame. Rise, purple Slaughter! furious rise; Unfold the terror of thine eyes; Dart thy vindictive shafts around: Let no strange land a shade afford, No conquer'd Nations call them Lord; Nor let their cities rise to curse the goodly ground. For thus Jehovah swears; no Name, no Son, No remnant, shall remain of haughty Babylon. Thus saith the righteous Lord: My Vengeance shall unsheath the flaming sword; O'er all thy realms my Fury shall be pour'd. Where yon proud city stood, I'll spread the stagnant flood; And there the Bittern in the sedge shall lurk, Moaning with sullen strain: While, sweeping o'er the plain, Destruction ends her work. Yes, on mine holy mountain's brow, I'll crush this proud Assyrian foe. Th' irrevocable word is spoke. From Judah's neck the galling yoke Spontaneous falls, she shines with wonted state; Thus by Myself I swear, and what I swear is Fate  539 ." Besides those poems which may be strictly termed odes, the general appellation, which in the Hebrew is equivalent to Canticle or Song, includes another species called by the Greeks, the Idyllium.---The reason of this name, and the definition of the poem to which it is appropriated. ---The historical Psalms in general belong properly to this class. ---The intercalary stanza and the nature of it. ---The elegant plan and arrangement of the hundred and seventh Psalm explained: also the ixth chapter of Isaiah, ver. 8. to chap . x. ver. 4. ---This passage a perfect specimen of the Idyllium: other examples of the Idyllium no less perfect as to style and form. ---The Hymn of Cleanthes the stoic commended. ---The cxxxixth Psalm in English verse . AMONGST those poems which by the Hebrews were adapted to music, and distinguished by the general appellation Shirim , there are some which differ in their nature from lyric poetry, strictly so called. It will therefore be more regular to class them with those compositions anciently termed Idylliums, the name and nature of which I shall endeavour to explain. Whether we are to attribute the invention of the name to the poets themselves, or to the grammarians who revised their works, is difficult to say; but we find some of the Greek poems distinguished by the title Eid e , which denotes a poem without any certain limitation as to form or subject. Even the odes of Pindar retain that appellation. But if there were any upon lighter subjects, or in a more humble strain, indeed in any respect of an inferior kind, and such as could not be classed under any of the common divisions, they were entitled Eidyllia . Thus the small poems of Theocritus, which consist chiefly of Bucolicks, intermingled with others of different kinds, are called Idylliums. In the same manner the Latins preferred the name of Eclogues , or poems selected from a number of others; and for a contrary and more modest reason, that of sylv ae (or woods ) was given to such verses as were hastily composed, and promiscuously thrown together, such as might afford matter for a more accurate revision or for a similar selection. But although the term Idyllium be a vague and general term, which denotes nothing certain relating to the nature of the poem, it still appears by use and custom to have obtained a certain and appropriated destination; and perhaps it may not be improperly defined, a poem of moderate length; of a uniform, middle style, chiefly distinguished for elegance and sweetness; regular and clear as to plot, conduct, and arrangement. There are many perfect examples of this kind of poem extant in the writings of the Hebrews; some of which, I presume, it will not be unpleasing singly to point out and explain. The first of these poems which attract our notice are the historical Psalms, in celebration of the power and the other attributes of the Deity, as instanced in the miracles which he performed in favour of his people. One of the principal of these, bearing the name of Asaph  540 , pursues the history of the Israelites from the time of their departure from Egypt to the reign of David, particularizing and illustrating all the leading events. The style is simple and uniform, but the structure is poetical, and the sentiments occasionally splendid. The historical, or rather chronological order, cannot be said to be exactly preserved throughout; for the minute detail of so protracted a series of events could scarcely fail to tire in a work of imagination. The Egyptian miracles are introduced in a very happy and elegant digression, and may be considered as forming a kind of episode. The same subject affords materials for two other Psalms, the hundred and fifth, and the hundred and sixth: the one including the history of Israel, from the call of Abraham to the Exodus; the other, from that period to the later ages of the commonwealth: both of them bear a strong resemblance to the seventy-eight, as well in the subject as in the style (except perhaps that the diction is rather of a more simple cast); the mixture of ease and grace, displayed in the exordium, is the same in all. These Psalms, both in plot and conduct, have a surprizing analogy to the Hymns of the Greeks. Indeed the Greek translators might very properly have given the title of Hymns to the book of Psalms, as that word agrees much more exactly with the Hebrew title Tehillim , than that which they have adopted. This species of poetry was very early in use among the Greeks, and was almost entirely appropriated to the celebration of their religious rites. The subjects in general were the origin of the Gods, the places of their birth, their atchievements, and the other circumstances of their history. Such are all the poems of this kind now extant in the Greek; such are the elegant hymns of Calimachus, as well as those which are attributed to Homer. The poem of Theocritus, entitled the and very elegant in its kind: nor is it improperly classed among the Idylliums, which may be said to include all of this species. But the true form and character of the Hymn is excellently expressed by the two choirs of Salii (or priests of war) in Virgil: "One choir of old, another of the young; To dance, and bear the burthen of the song; The lay records the labours and the praise, And all th' immortal acts of Hercules  541 ." Those ancient hymns, which are falsely attributed to Orpheus, are more properly initiatory Songs; for they contain "little more than invocations of the Gods, which were made use of by those who were initiated in the sacred mysteries of any of the Gods  542 ." Ovid, who was both an elegant and a learned poet, united the excellencies of both these species of Hymns: for the exordium of the Hymn to Bacchus contains the invocations of that God, or in other words, announces solemnly his name and titles; the remainder celebrates his perfections and atchievements  543 . There is yet another Psalm, which may be enumerated among those of the historical kind, namely, the hundred and thirty-sixth. It celebrates the praises of the Almighty, and proclaims his infinite power and goodness; beginning with the work of creation, and proceeding to the miracles of the Exodus, the principal of which are related almost in the historical order. The exordium commences with this well-known distich: "Glorify Jehovah , for he is good; For his mercy endureth for ever:" which, according to Ezra  544 , was commonly sung by alternate choirs. There is, however, one circumstance remarkable attending it, which is, that the latter line of the distich, being added by the second choir, and also subjoined to every verse (which is a singular case) forms a perpetual Epode. Hence the whole nature and form of the intercalary verse, or (burthen of the Song) may be collected: it expresses in a clear, concise, and simple manner, some particular sentiment, which seems to include virtually the general subject or design of the poem; and it is thrown in at proper intervals, according to the nature and arrangement of it, for the sake of impressing the subject more firmly upon the mind. That the intercalary verse is perfectly congenial to the Idyllium, is evident from the authority of Theocritus, Bion, Moschus, and even of Virgil. I shall add one or two examples from the Sacred Poetry, which will not lose in a comparison with the most perfect specimens in this department of poetry, which those excellent writers have bequeathed to posterity: and in order to illustrate as well the elegance of the poem in general, as the peculiar force and beauty of the intercalary verse, the order and conduct of the subject must be particularly explained. The hundred and seventh Psalm may undoubtedly be enumerated among the most elegant monuments of antiquity; and it is chiefly indebted for its elegance to the general plan and conduct of the poem. It celebrates the goodness and mercy of God towards mankind, as demonstrated in the immediate assistance and comfort which he affords, in the greatest calamities, to those who devoutly implore his aid. In the first place, to those who wander in the desert, and who encounter the horrors of famine; next, to those who are in bondage; to those who are afflicted with disease; and finally, to those who are tossed about upon the ocean. The prolixity of the argument is occasionally relieved by narration; and examples are superadded of the divine severity in punishing the wicked, as well as of his benignity to the devout and virtuous; and both the narrative and preceptive parts are recommended to the earnest contemplation of considerate minds. Thus the whole poem actually divides into five parts nearly equal; the four first of which conclude with an intercalary verse, expressive of the subject or design of the hymn: "Glorify Jehovah for his mercy, And for his wonders to the children of men." This distich also is occasionally diversified, and another sometimes annexed illustrative of the sentiment; "For he satisfieth the famished soul, And filleth the hungry with good." "For he hath broken the brazen gates, And the bolts of iron he hath cut in sunder." The sentiment of the Epode itself is sometimes repeated, only varied by different imagery: "Glorify Jehovah for his mercy, And for his wonders to the children of men: Let them also offer sacrifices of praise, And let them declare his works with melody." "Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people, And in the council of the elders let them celebrate him." In all these passages, the transition from the contemplation of their calamities, to that of their deliverance, which is made by the perpetual repetition of the same distich, is truly elegant: "Let them also cry unto Jehovah in their troubles; And from their afflictions he will deliver them:" This however does not appear in the least to partake of the nature of the intercalary verse. The latter part of the Psalm, which comprehends a vast variety of matter, concludes with two distichs expressive of a sentiment, grave, solemn, and practical, and in no respect unworthy the rest of the poem. There are many other examples to be found in the Psalms; but it must be confessed, few of them are equal, and none of them superior to this. I shall select another specimen from Isaiah; and the more willingly, because, in it, as in other passages of the same author, the common division into chapters has greatly obscured that most elegant writer, by absurdly breaking the unity of a very interesting poem, and connecting each part with matter which is totally foreign to the subject. If we unite the conclusion of the ninth chapter with the beginning of the tenth, we shall find a complete and connected prophecy against the kingdom of Israel or Samaria  545 . It is replete with terror and solemnity, and possesses a degree of force and sublimity to which the Idyllium seldom rises; though it preserves the form of the Idyllium so perfect and express, that it cannot with propriety be referred to any other class. The poem consists of four parts, each of which contains a denunciation of vengeance against the crimes of this rebellious people, vehemently accusing them of some atrocious offence, and distinctly marking out the particular punishment. In the first, the pride and ostentation of the Israelites is reproved; in the second, the obduracy of their spirit, and the general depravation of their morals; in the third, their audacious impiety, which rages like a flame, destroying and laying waste the nation; and lastly, their iniquity is set forth as demonstrated in their partial administration of justice, and their oppression of the poor. To each of these a specific punishment is annexed; and a clause, declaratory of a further reserve of the divine vengeance is added, which forms the Epode, and is admirably calculated to exaggerate the horror of the prediction: "For all this his anger is not turned away; But his hand is still stretched out." The examples which I have hitherto produced will, at first view, explain their own nature and kind; there are, however, others, and probably not a few, (in the book of Psalms particularly) which may equally be accounted of the Idyllium species. I have principally in contemplation those, in which some particular subject is treated in a more copious and regular manner, than is usual in compositions strictly lyric. Such is the hundred and fourth Psalm, which demonstrates the glory of the infinite Creator, from the wisdom, beauty, and variety of his works. The poet embellishes this noble subject with the clearest and most splendid colouring of language; and with imagery the most magnificent, lively, diversified, and pleasing, at the same time select, and happily adapted to the subject. There is nothing of the kind extant, indeed nothing can be conceived, more perfect than this Hymn, whether it be considered with respect to its intrinsic beauties, or as a model of that species of composition. Miraculous exertions of the divine power have something in them which at first strikes the inattentive mind with a strong sentiment of sublimity and awe: but the true subject of praise, the most worthy of God, and the best adapted to impress upon the heart of man a fervent and permanent sense of piety, is drawn from the contemplation of his power in the creation of this infinite All, his wisdom in arranging and adorning it, his providence in sustaining, and his mercy in the regulation of its minutest parts, and in ordering and directing the affairs of men. The Greek Hymns consisted chiefly of fables, and these fables regarded persons and events, which were neither laudable in themselves, nor greatly to be admired; indeed I do not recollect any that are extant of this sublime nature, except that of the famous stoic Cleanthes, which is inscribed to Jove, that is to God the creator, or as he expresses himself, "to the Eternal Mind, the Creator and Governor of Nature 546 ." It is doubtless a most noble monument of ancient wisdom, and replete with truths not less solid than magnificent. For the sentiments of the philosopher concerning the divine power, concerning the harmony of nature, and the supreme laws, concerning the folly and unhappiness of wicked men, who are unceasingly subject to the pain and perturbation of a troubled spirit; and above all, the ardent supplication for the divine assistance, in order to enable him to celebrate the praises of the omnipotent Deity in a suitable manner, and in a perpetual strain of praise and adoration; all of these breathe so true and unaffected a spirit of piety, that they seem in some measure to approach the excellence of the Sacred Poetry. The Hymn of David, which I have just mentioned, deservedly occupies the first place in this class of poems; that which comes nearest to it, as well in the conduct of the poem as in the beauty of the style, is another of the same author. It celebrates the omniscience of the Deity, and the incomparable art and design displayed in the formation of the human body; if it be excelled (as perhaps it is) by the former in the plan, disposition, and arrangement of the matter, it is however not in the least inferior in the dignity and elegance of the figures and imagery: "Thou, Lord, hast search'd me out, thine eyes Mark when I sit, and when I rise; By thee my future thoughts are read; Thou round my path, and round my bed, Attendest vigilant; each word, Ere yet I speak, by thee is heard. Life's maze, before my view outspread, Within thy presence rapt I tread, And touch'd with conscious horror stand Beneath the shadow of thy hand. How deep thy knowledge, Lord, how wide! Long to the fruitless talk applied, That mighty sea my thoughts explore, Nor reach its depth, nor find its shore. Where shall I shun thy wakeful eye, Or whither from thy spirit fly? Aloft to heaven my course I bear; In vain; for thou, my God, art there: If prone to hell my feet descend, Thou still my footsteps shalt attend: If now, on swiftest wings upborne, I seek the regions of the morn, Or haste me to the western steep, Where eve sits brooding o'er the deep; Thy hand the fugitive shall stay, And dictate to my steps their way. Perchance within its thickest veil The darkness shall my head conceal: But, instant, thou hast chas'd away The gloom, and round me pour'd the day. Darkness, great God! to thee there's none; Darkness and light to thee are one; Nor brighter shines, to thee display'd, The noon, than night's obscurest shade. My reins, my fabrick's ev'ry part, The wonders of thy plastic art Proclaim, and prompt my willing tongue To meditate the grateful song: With deepest awe my thoughts their frame Surveys--- "I tremble that I am." "While yet a stranger to the day Within the burthen'd womb I lay, My bones, familiar to thy view, By just degrees to firmness grew: Day to succeeding day consign'd Th' unfinish'd birth; thy mighty mind Each limb, each nerve, e'er yet they were, Contemplated, distinct, and clear; Those nerves thy curious finger spun, Those limbs it fashion'd one by one; And, as thy pen in fair design Trac'd on thy book each shadowy line, Thy handmaid Nature read them there, And made the growing work her care; Conform'd it to th' unerring plan, And gradual wrought me into man. With what delight, great God, I trace The acts of thy stupendous grace! To count them, were to count the sand That lies upon the sea-beat strand. When from my temples sleep retires, To thee my thankful heart aspires, And with thy sacred presence blest, Joys to receive the awful guest. Shall impious men thy will withstand, Nor feel the vengeance of thy hand? Hence, murth'rers, hence, nor near me stay; Ye sons of Violence, away! When lawless crouds, with insult vain, Thy works revile, thy name profane, Can I unmov'd those insults see, Nor hate the wretch that hateth thee? Indignant, in thy cause I join, And all thy foes, my God, are mine. Searcher of hearts, my thoughts review; With kind severity pursue Through each disguise thy servant's mind, Nor leave one stain of guilt behind. Guide through th' eternal path my feet, And bring me to thy blissful seat." The Platonic division of Poetry into the narrative, dramatic, and mixed kinds, of little use; but deserves to be noticed on this occasion, as leading to an accurate definition of Dramatic Poetry, and clearing up the ambiguity in which the term has been involved by the moderns.---Two species pointd out: the lesser, which possesses only the form of dialogue, without the personal intervention of the Poet; and the greater, which contains a plot or fable.--- There are extant some instances of the former in the writings of the Hebrews; but none of their productions seem to have the least title to the latter character, two perhaps excepted; the Song of Solomon, and the Book of Job.--- Inquiry, whether the Song of Solomon contain a complete plot or fable.---It is an Epithalamium: the characters which are represented in it: the Poem founded upon the nuptial rites of the Hebrews.---The opinion of Bossuet cited and explained; namely, that this Poem is a representation of the seven days of festival which succeeded the marriage, and consequently consists of seven parts or divisions.---This opinion the most favourable of all, to those who account this Poem a regular Drama: it however does not prove, that it contains a complete plot or fable.---Definition of a Dramatic Fable.---Nothing like it in the Song of Solomon: it is therefore not a perfect Drama, but is of the lesser class of Dramatic Poems.---The chorus of Virgins bears a great analogy to the chorus of the Greek Tragedies; but could not serve as a model for them . THE ancient critics following the authority of Plato  547 , have distributed all poetical compositions, according to their form or subject, into three classes, the narrative, the imitative or dramatic, and the mixed. This arrangement is, however, not of much use on the whole; it neither draws a perfect line of distinction between the different species of poems, nor serves to define or explain the nature and form of any. There is scarcely any species of poem perfectly simple in its nature, scarcely any which does not occasionally unite these different modes of expression. The Epic indeed may be said to exhibit almost invariably a narration of the mixed kind; and the Dramatic necessarily assumes the imitative form. But as other poems may adopt freely the mixed narration; so I do not see any just reason why they should be absolutely prohibited from assuming the Dramatic form. Custom, however, we find has so far prevailed, that although the style and manner does not seem necessarily appropriated to any particular subject whatever, the name at least of Dramatic has been generally received as distinguishing a particular species of poetry. The present object of inquiry is, therefore, what specimens of this species of composition are extant in the writings of the Hebrews: and in the very first stage of our investigation, some degree of caution will be required, lest the ambiguity of the term, as it has been used by the moderns, should mislead or perplex us. The term Dramatic Poetry, as I before observed, is now restricted to two particular species of composition, Tragedy and Comedy. It was originally, however, of much more extensive signification; it regarded simply the external form; it was properly applied to every poem composed in dialogue, provided that, throughout the whole, the conversation was carried on by the characters themselves, without the intervention of the Poet  548 This mode of composition is exemplified in several of the Bucolics of Theocritus and Virgil, in some of the Satires of Horace, and in two of his Odes. In order, therefore, to examine the subject more accurately, it will be proper to distinguish two species of Dramatic Poems; the lesser, in which, by means of dialogue or characters, the manners, passions, and actions of men, are imitated or delineated; and the greater, which contains, moreover, a plot or fable, that is, the representation of some incident or transaction of life, regular or complete, in which events succeed each other in a connected series, and which after various and interesting vicissitudes is wrought up to a perfect conclusion. This latter species includes both Tragedy and Comedy; and as the plot or fable distinguishes them from the inferior species of Dramatic Poetry, so the perfect form of dialogue serves to draw the line between them and the Epic. There are abundant examples of the former species of Dramatic Poetry manifestly extant in the writings of the Hebrews; and perhaps there are many others, which we have not discovered to be of this kind  549 . The sudden change of persons, when by the vehemence of passion the author is led, as it were insensibly, from the narration of an event to the imitation or acting of it, is frequent in the Hebrew poetry; but sometimes the genuine Dramatic, or Dialogue form, is quite apparent, and the passage will admit of no other explanation. The twenty-fourth Psalm is evidently of this kind, relating, as I formerly endeavoured to prove, to the transferring of the ark to Mount Sion; and the whole of the transaction is exhibited in a theatrical manner, though the dialogue is not fully obvious till towards the conclusion of the poem. That remarkable passage of Isaiah also, deserves notice on this occasion, in which the Messiah, coming to vengeance, is introduced conversing with a chorus as on a theatre: "Who is this, that cometh from Edom? With garments deeply dyed from Botsra? This, that is magnificent in his apparel; Marching on in the greatness of his strength? I, who publish righteousness, and am mighty to save. Wherefore is thine apparel red? And thy garments, as of one that treadeth the wine-vat: I have trodden the vat alone; And of the peoples there was not a man with me. And I trod them in mine anger; And I trampled them in mine indignation: And their life-blood was sprinkled upon my garments; And I have stained all mine apparel. For the day of vengeance was in my heart; And the year of my redeemed was come. And I looked, and there was no one to help; And I was astonished, that there was no one to uphold: Therefore mine own arm wrought salvation for me, And mine indignation itself sustained me. And I trod down the peoples in mine anger; And I crushed them in mine indignation; And I spilled their life-blood on the ground  550 ." The hundred and twenty-first Psalm is of the same kind; and as it is both concise and elegant, I shall quote it at large. The king, apparently going forth to battle, first approaches the ark of God upon Mount Sion, and humbly implores the Divine assistance, on which alone he professes to rest his confidence: "I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains, Whence cometh my succour. My succour is from Jehovah , Who made the heavens and the earth." The High-priest answers him from the Tabernacle: "He will not suffer thy foot to stumble; He that preserveth thee will not slumber; Behold, he will neither slumber nor sleep; He who preserveth Israel. The sun shall not injure thee by day, Nor the moon by night. He will preserve thy soul. From this time forth for ever and ever." Thus much will suffice for that inferior species of Dramatic Poetry, or rather that Dramatic form which may be assumed by any species of poem. The more perfect and regular Drama, that I mean which consists of a plot or fable, will demand a more elaborate investigation. There are only two poems extant among the writings of the Hebrews which can, on the present occasion, at all be brought into question, the Song of Solomon, and the book of Job; both eminent in the highest degree for elegance, sublimity, and I am sorry to add obscurity also. The almost infinite labours of the learned have left us but little new to say upon this subject; I shall, however, proceed to inquire, with some degree of minuteness, into the form and structure of each of these poems, and into the reasons which may be alledged in favour of their claim to the appellation of regular Dramas. The opinions of other critics shall not pass unregarded, if any remarks or even conjectures occur, which may be likely to throw any light upon the present subject, or to explain or illustrate their principal beauties. The Song of Songs (for so it is entitled either on account of the excellence of the subject, or of the composition) is an Epithalamium, or Nuptial Dialogue; or rather, if we may be allowed to give it a title more agreeable to the genius of the Hebrew, a Song of Loves 551 . It is expressive of the utmost fervour as well as the utmost delicacy of passion, it is instinct with all the spirit and all the sweetness of affection. The principal characters are Solomon himself and his bride, who are represented speaking both in dialogue, and in soliloquy when accidentally separated. Virgins also, the companions of the bride, are introduced, who seem to be constantly upon the stage, and bear a part in the dialogue: mention too is made of young men, friends of the bridegroom, but they are mute persons 552 . This is exactly conformable to the manners of the Hebrews, who had always a number of companions to the bridegroom, thirty of whom were present in honour of Sampson, at his nuptial feast  553 . In the New Testament, according to the Hebrew idiom, they are called, "children (or sons) of the bride-chamber 554 ," and "friends of the bridegroom  555 ;" there too we find mention of ten virgins, who went forth to meet the bridegroom, and conduct him home  556 557 : which circumstances, I think, indicate that this poem is founded upon the nuptial rites of the Hebrews, and is expressive of the forms or ceremonial of their marriages. In this opinion, indeed, the harmony  558 of commentators is not less remarkable, than their disagreement concerning the general economy and conduct of the work, and the order and arrangement of the several parts. The present object of inquiry, however, is only whether any plot or fable be contained or represented in this poem; and upon this point, the most probable opinion is that of the celebrated Bossuet  559 , a critic, whose profound learning will ever be acknowledged, and a scholar whose exquisite taste will ever be admired. I shall endeavour, as briefly as possible, to explain his sentiments concerning the form and conduct of this poem, whence we shall probably be enabled to decide in some measure concerning the equity of its claim to the title of a regular Drama. It is agreed on all parts, that the nuptial feast, as well as every other solemn rite among the Hebrews, was hebdomadal  560 . Of this circumstance M. Bossuet has availed himself in the analysation of the poem, and he accordingly divides the whole into seven parts, corresponding to the seven days of its supposed duration  561 . The vicissitudes of day and night are marked with some degree of distinctness; he therefore makes use of these as indexes, to point to the true division of the parts. The nuptial banquet being concluded, the bride is led in the evening to her future husband; and here commences the nuptial week; for the Hebrews, in their account of time, begin always at the evening  562 . The bridegroom, who is represented in the character of a shepherd, goes forth early in the morning to the accustomed occupations of a rural and pastoral life; the bride presently awaking, and impatient of his absence, breaks out into a soliloquy full of tenderness and anxiety, and this incident forms the exordium of the poem. The early departure of the bridegroom seems to be according to custom; hence that precaution so frequently and so anxiously repeated not to disturb his beloved: "I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes and the hinds of the field, That ye disturb not, neither awake The beloved, 'till herself be inclined  563 ." Nor less frequent is the following exclamation of the Virgins: "Who is she, rising up out of the desert! Who is she, that is seen like the morning  564 !" In these terms they seem to greet the bride when she first comes out of her chamber: and these several expressions have some allusion to the early time of the morning. The night is also sometimes mentioned in direct terms  565 , and sometimes it is indirectly denoted by circumstances  566 . If therefore any reader, admitting these indications of time, will carefully attend to them, he cannot, I think, but perceive, that the whole of the work consists of seven parts or divisions, each of which occupies the space of a day  567 . The same critic adds, that he can discover the last day to be clearly distinguished as the sabbath; for the bridegroom does not then, as usual, go forth to his rural employments, but proceeds from the marriage-chamber into public with his bride  568 Such are the sentiments of this learned person; to which I am inclined to accede, not as absolute demonstration, but as a very ingenious and probable conjecture upon an extremely obscure subject: I follow them therefore as a glimmering of light, which beams forth in the midst of darkness, where it would be almost unreasonable to hope for any clearer illumination. This opinion is the most favourable of all to those who account the Song of Solomon a regular Drama; for this arrangement seems to display, in some measure, the order and method of a theatrical representation. But if they make use of the term Dramatic according to the common acceptation of the word, this poem must be supposed to contain a fable, or entire and perfect plot or action, of a moderate extent, in which the incidents are all connected, and proceed regularly from one another, and which, after several vicissitudes, is brought to a perfect conclusion. But certainly the bare representation of a nuptial festival cannot in any respect answer to this definition. We are, it is true, very imperfectly instructed in the particular rites and ceremonies of the Hebrew marriages; but we have no reason to suppose, that in their common and usual form they were possessed of such variety and vicissitude of fortunes and events, as to afford materials for a regular plot or fable. The whole was one even tenour of joy and festivity. An unexpected incident might indeed sometimes occur to interrupt the usual order, and to produce such a change of fortune, as might afford a basis for a Dramatic story; and if any such incident is to be found in the poem at present under our consideration, it will establish its claim to that appellation. But the truth is, the keenest inspection of criticism can, throughout the whole, discover no such incident or circumstance; the state of affairs is uniformly the same from the beginning to the end; a few light fluctuations of passion excepted, such as the anxiety of absence, and the amenity and happiness which the lovers enjoy in each others presence. The bride laments the absence of her beloved  569 ; she seeks, she finds him, she brings him home; again he is lost, she seeks him again, but with different success; she complains, languishes, indites messages to be delivered to him, she indulges her passion in a full and animated description of his person. All this, however, bears no resemblance to a regular plot, nor affords the piece any fairer title to the appellation of a perfect Drama, than the Dramatic Eclogues of Theocritus and Virgil, in which the loves, the amusements, and the emulations of shepherds are depicted, and which no critic has ever classed with the regular fables of Euripides and Terence. Thus far therefore we may safely admit, that the Song of Solomon possesses indeed the Dramatic form, and therefore belongs properly to that inferior species, which was mentioned in the former part of this Lecture; but that it cannot, upon any fair grounds of reason, be accounted a regular Drama. There is however one circumstance in which this poem bears a very near affinity to the Greek Drama: the chorus of Virgins seems in every respect congenial to the tragic chorus of the Greeks. They are constantly present, and prepared to fulfill all the duties of advice and consolation: they converse frequently with the principal characters; they are questioned by them, and they return answers to their inquiries; they take part in the whole business of the poem, and I do not find that upon any occasion they quit the scene. Some of the learned have conjectured, that Theocritus, who was contemporary with the seventy Greek translators of the Scriptures, and lived with them in the court of Ptolemy Philadelphus, was not unacquainted with the beauties of this poem, and that he has almost literally introduced some passages from it into his elegant Idylliums  570 . It might also be suspected, that the Greek tragedians were indebted for their chorus to this poem of Solomon, were not the probabilities on the other side much greater, that the Greeks were made acquainted with it at too late a period; and were it not evident, that the chorus of the Greeks had a very different origin, were it not evident indeed that the chorus was not added to the fable, but the fable to the chorus  571 . The question debated, whether the Song of Solomon is to be taken in a literal or allegorical sense: the allegorical sense defended upon the grounds of the Parabolic style.---The nature and ground-work of this allegory explained.--- The fastidiousness of those critics reproved, who pretend to take offence at the freedom of some of those images which are found in the Sacred Writings; the nature of those images explained.---The allegorical interpretation confirmed by analogical arguments: not equally demonstrable from the internal structure of the work itself.---This allegory of the third or mystical species; the subject literally relating to the nuptials of Solomon.---Two cautions to be observed by commentators.---The style of the Poem pastoral: the characters are represented as pastoral; how agreeable this to the manners of the Hebrews.---The elegance of the topics descriptions, comparisons of this Poem: illustrated by examples . probable, among the great variety of opinions which have prevailed, concerning the conduct and economy of the Song of Solomon, a question next presents itself for our investigation, not less involved in doubt and obscurity, I mean the real nature and subject of the poem. Some are of opinion, that it is to be taken altogether in a literal sense, and others esteem it wholly allegorical. There is no less disagreement also among those who consider it as allegorical; some conceive it to be no more than a simple allegory, while others place it in that class which I have denominated mystical, that, namely, which is founded upon the basis of history. I would gladly, from the first, have considered this question as foreign to my undertaking, and would have avoided it as involved in the deepest obscurity, had I not, in the former part of these Lectures, been under the necessity of remarking the connexion between the different kinds of allegory and the principles of the Sacred Poetry; had I not also found it necessary to advert to all the peculiarities of the parabolic style, the most obvious property of which is to express by certain images, chiefly adopted from natural objects, the analogy and application of which is regularly presereved, those ideas and doctrines which are more remote from common apprehension. This I cannot help considering as a matter of the utmost importance, in enabling us to understand properly the poetry of the Hebrews; and upon this point much of the present argument will be found to depend. I shall on this, as well as upon the last occasion, proceed with that cautious reserve which I think prudent and necessary on so obscure a subject; and since certainty is not to be obtained, I shall content myself with proposing to your consideration what appears least improbable. In the first place then I confess, that by several reasons, by the general authority and consent of both the Jewish and Christian churches; and still more, by the nature and analogy of the parabolic style, I feel irresistibly inclined to that side of the question which considers this poem as an entire allegory. Those, indeed, who have considered it in a different light, and who have objected against the inconsistency and meanness of the imagery, seem to be but little acquainted with the genius of the parabolic diction; for the removal, therefore, of these difficulties, which I find have been the cause of offence to many persons, I shall beg leave to trespass upon your attention, while I explain somewhat more accurately, the nature of this allegory, and its analogy with other productions of the Hebrew poets. The narrowness and imbecillity of the human mind being such, as scarcely to comprehend or attain a clear idea of any part of the Divine nature by its utmost exertions; God has condescended, in a manner, to contract the infinity of his glory, and to exhibit it to our understandings under such imagery as our feeble optics are capable of contemplating. Thus the Almighty may be said to descend, as it were, in the Holy Scriptures, from the height of his majesty, to appear on earth in a human shape, with human senses and affections, in all respects resembling a mortal---"with human voice and human form." This kind of allegory is called anthropopathy, and occupies a considerable portion of theology, properly so called, that is, as delivered in the Holy Scriptures. The principal part of this imagery is derived from the passions; nor indeed is there any one affection or emotion of the human soul which is not, with all its circumstances, ascribed in direct terms, without any qualification whatever, to the supreme God; not excepting those in which human frailty and imperfection is most evidently displayed, anger and grief, hatred and revenge. That love also, and that of the tenderest kind, should bear a part in this Drama, is highly natural and perfectly consistent. Thus, not only the fondness of paternal affection is attributed to God, but also the force, the ardour, and the solicitude of conjugal attachment, with all the concomitant emotions, the anxiety, the tenderness, the jealousy incidental to this passion. After all, this figure is not in the least productive of obscurity; the nature of it is better understood than that of most others; and although it be exhibited in a variety of lights, it constantly preserves its native perspicuity. A peculiar people, of the posterity of Abraham, was selected by God from among the nations, and he ratified his choice by a solemn covenant. This covenant was founded upon reciprocal conditions; on the one part love, protection, and support; on the other faith, obedience, and worship pure and devout. This is that conjugal union between God and his church; that solemn compact so frequently celebrated by almost all the sacred writers under this image. It is indeed a remarkable instance of that species of metaphor which Aristotle calls analogical  572 ; that is, when in a proposition consisting of four ideas, the first bears the same relation to the second as the third does to the fourth, and the corresponding words may occasionally change their places without any injury to the sense. Thus in this form of expression God is supposed to bear exactly the same relation to the church as a husband to a wife; God is represented as the spouse of the church, and the church as the betrothed of God. Thus also, when the same figure is maintained with a different mode of expression, and connected with different circumstances, the relation is still the same: thus the piety of the people, their impiety, their idolatry, and rejection, stand in the same relation with respect to the sacred covenant; as chastity, modesty, immodesty, adultery, divorce, with respect to the marriage contract. And this notion is so very familiar and well understood in Scripture, that the word adultery (or whoredom) is commonly used to denote idolatrous worship, and so appropriated does it appear to this metaphorical purpose, that it very seldom occurs in its proper and literal sense. Let us only observe how freely the sacred poets employ this image, how they dwell upon it, in how many different forms they introduce it, and how little they seem to fear exhibiting it with all its circumstances. Concerning the reconciliation of the church to Almighty God, and its restoration to the divine favour, amongst many images of a similar nature, the elegant Isaiah introduces the following: "For thy husband is thy maker; And thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called  573 ." And in another passage in the form of a comparison: "For as a young man weddeth a virgin, So shall thy Restorer wed thee  574 : "And as the bridegroom rejoiceth in his bride, So shall thy God rejoice in thee  575 ." The same image a little diversified, and with greater freedom of expression, as better adapted to the display of indignation, is introduced by Jeremiah 576 , when he declaims against the defection of the Jews from the worship of the true God. Upon the same principle the former part of the prophecy of Hosea ought also to be explained; and whether that part of the prophecy be taken in the literal and historical sense, or whether it be esteemed altogether allegorical, still the nature and principles of this figure, which seems consecrated in some measure to this subject, will evidently appear. None of the Prophets, however, have applied the image with so much boldness and freedom as Ezekiel, an author of a most fervid imagination, who is little studious of elegance, or cautious of offending; insomuch, that I am under some apprehension of his incurring no inconsiderable share of censure from those over-delicate critics who have been emitted from the Gallic schools  577 His great freedom in the use of this image is particularly displayed in two parables  578 , in which he describes the ingratitude of the Jews and Israelites to their great Protector, and-their defection from the true worship under imagery assumed from the character of an adulterous wife, and the meretricious loves of two unchaste women. If these parables (which are put into the mouth of God himself with a direct allegorical application, and in which it must be confessed, that delicacy does not appear to be particularly studied) be well considered, I am persuaded, that the Song of Solomon (which is in every part chaste and elegant) will not appear unworthy of the divine sense in which it is usually taken, either in matter or style, or in any degree inferior either in gravity or purity to the other remains of the Sacred Poets. To these instances I may add the forty-fifth Psalm, which is a sacred Epithalamium, of the allegorical application of which, to the union between God and the church, I do not find that any doubt has hitherto been entertained; though many suspect it, and not without good reason, to have been produced upon the same occasion, and with the same relation to a real fact  579 as the Song of Solomon. Neither ought we to omit, that the writers of the New Testament  580 have freely admitted the same image in the same allegorical sense with their predecessors, and have finally consecrated it by their authority  581 . These reasons appear to me sufficient to remove those objections founded on the meanness of the imagery, which render many critics averse to the allegorical explanation of this poem. I shall not attempt to confirm this opinion by any internal evidence from the poem itself, as I do not scruple to confess myself deterred by the great difficulty of the undertaking. For though induced by the most ancient authority, and still more by the analogy of this with other similar allegories contained in the Hebrew writings, I am fully persuaded of the truth of what I have advanced; yet I am still apprehensive that it would be extremely difficult to establish the hypothesis by direct arguments from the internal structure of the work itself  582 . But if, after all, it be allowed that this work is of the allegorical kind, another question remains, namely, to which of the three classes of allegory already specified it properly belongs. The first of these, you will recollect, was the continued metaphor; the second the parable, strictly so called; and the third, the mystical allegory, which, under the veil of some historical fact, conceals a meaning more sacred and sublime. I must confess, that I am clearly of the same opinion with those who assign this production to the latter class of allegories; the reason of which will be evident, if it be admitted that there is any thing in the poem at all allegorical; since there can scarcely be any doubt that it relates in a literal sense to the nuptials of Solomon. Those also who are conversant with the writings of the Hebrew poets will easily perceive how agreeable the conduct of this poem is to the practice of those writers, who are fond of annexing a secret and solemn sense to the obvious meaning of their compositions, and of looking through the medium of human affairs to those which are celestial and divine. The subject of the Canticles appears to be the marriage feast of Solomon (who was both in name and in reality the Prince of Peace); his bride is also called Solomitis 583 , the same name with a feminine termination; though the latter Jews have strangely disguised and obscured it by a vicious pronunciation: for Solomon and Solomitis have evidently the same relation to each other, as the Latin names Caius and Caia. This circumstance of the names was not to be disregarded, since they seem to have a very strict connexion, and to afford a very distinct intimation of the latent meaning: for to what purpose innovate the usual practice of the Hebrews, by assigning to the wife of Solomon the same name, unless from a regard to the force and meaning of the word? Unless it was meant to indicate, that the name of Solomon himself was not without importance, not without some further aim than merely the distinction of the person? Who this wife of Solomon was, is not clearly ascertained: but some of the learned have conjectured, with an appearance of probability, that she was the daughter of Pharaoh, to whom Solomon was known to be particularly attached. May we not therefore, with some shadow of reason, suspect, that under the allegory of Solomon chusing a wife from the Egyptians, might be darkly typified that other Prince of Peace, who was to espouse a church, chosen from among the Gentiles  584 ? Concerning the explanation of this allegory, I will only add, that, in the first place, we ought to be cautious of carrying the figurative application too far, and of entering into a precise explication of every particular: as these minute investigations are seldom conducted with sufficient prudence not to offend the serious part of mankind, learned as well as unlearned. Again, I would advise, that this production be treated according to the established rules of this kind of allegory, fully and expressly delivered in the Sacred Writings, and that the author be permitted to be his own interpreter. In this respect the errors of critics and divines  585 have been as numerous as they have been pernicious. Not to mention other absurdities, they have taken the allegory not as denoting the universal state of the church, but the spiritual state of individuals; than which, nothing can be more inconsistent with the very nature and ground-work of the allegory itself, as well as with the general practice of the Hebrew poets on these occasions. It remains to offer a few remarks upon the style of this poem. I formerly intimated that it was of the pastoral kind; since the two principal personages are represented in the character of shepherds  586 . This circumstance is by no means incongruous to the manners of the Hebrews, whose principal occupation consisted in the care of cattle  587 ; nor did they consider this employment as beneath the dignity of the highest characters. Least of all, could it be supposed inconsistent with the character of Solomon  588 , whose father was raised from the sheep-fold to the throne of Israel. The pastoral life is not only most delightful in itself, but, from the particular circumstances and manners of the Hebrews, is possessed of a kind of dignity. In this poem it is adorned with all the choicest colouring of language, with all the elegance and variety of the most select imagery. "Every part of the Canticles," says a modern writer, "abounds in poetical beauties; the objects, which present themselves on every side, are the choicest plants, the most beautiful flowers, the most delicious fruits, the bloom and vigour of spring, the sweet verdure of the fields, flourishing and well-watered gardens, pleasant streams, and perrenial fountains. The other senses are represented as regaled with the most precious odours, natural and artificial; with the sweet singing of birds, and the soft voice of the turtle; with milk and honey, and the choicest of wine. To these enchantments are added all that is beautiful and graceful in the human form, the endearments, the caresses, the delicacy of love; if any object be introduced which seems not to harmonize with this delightful scene, such as the awful prospect of tremendous precipices, the wildness of the mountains, or the haunts of the lions; its effect is only to heighten by the contrast the beauty of the other objects, and to add the charms of variety to those of grace and elegance  589 ." In the following passage the force and splendour of description is united with all the softness and tenderness of passion: "Get thee up my companion, My lovely one, come away: For lo! the winter is past, The rain is over, is gone, The flowers are seen on the earth; The season of the song is come, And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land: The fig-tree puts forth its green figs, And the vine's tender grapes yield a fragrance: Arise, my companion, my fair one, and come  590 ." The following comparisons abound in sweetness and delicacy: "How sweet is thy love, O my sister, O spouse, How much better than wine is thy love, And the odour of thy perfumes than all spices! Thy lips, O spouse, distil honey from the comb, Honey and milk are under thy tongue, And the scent of thy garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon  591 ." There are some others which demand a more accurate investigation. "Thy hair is like a flock of goats, That browse upon Mount Gilead  592 ." The hair of the goats was soft, smooth, of a yellow cast, like that of the bride  593 ; her beautiful tresses are compared with the numerous flocks of goats which covered this flourishing mountain from the top to the bottom. "Thy teeth are like the shorn flock  594 Which have come up from the washing place, All of which have twins  595 , And none among them is bereaved." The evenness, whiteness, and unbroken order of the teeth, is admirably expressed. "Like the twice-dyed thread of crimson are thy lips, And thy language is sweet." That is, thin and ruby-coloured, such as add peculiar graces to the sweetness of the voice. "Like the slice of a pomegranate Are thy cheeks amidst thy tresses  596 ." Partly obscured, as it were, by her hair, and exhibiting a gentle blush of red from beneath the delicate shade, as the seeds of the pomegranate (the colour of which is white tinged with red) surrounded by the rind. "Thy neck is like the tower of David Built for an armoury  597 ; A thousand shields are hung up against it, All bucklers for the mighty." The neck is described as long, erect, slender, according to the nicest proportion; decorated with gold, gems, and large pearls. It is compared with some turret of the citadel of Sion, more lofty than the rest, remarkable for its elegance, and not less illustrious for its architecture than for the trophies with which it was adorned, being hung round with shields and other implements of war. "Thy two breasts are like two young kids, Twins of the gazal, that browse among the lilies  598 ." Delicate and smooth, standing equally prominent from the ivory bosom. The animal with which they are compared is an animal of exquisite beauty, and from that circumstance it derives its name in the Hebrew. Nothing can, I think, be imagined more truly elegant and poetical than all these passages, nothing more apt or expressive, than these comparisons. The discovery of these excellencies, however, only serves to increase our regret for the many beauties which we have lost, the perhaps superior graces, which extreme antiquity seems to have overcast with an impenetrable shade  599 . M. In order to criticise the book of Job with any degree of satisfaction to his auditors, the critic must explain his own sentiments concerning the work in general.---The book of Job a singular composition, and has little or no connexion with the affairs of the Hebrews.---The seat of the history is Idum aea; and the characters are evidently Idumaean, of the family of Abraham; the author appears to be an Idumaean, who spoke the Hebrew as his vernacular tongue.---Neither Elihu nor Moses, rather Job himself, or some contemporary. ---This appears to be the oldest book extant: founded upon true history, and contains no allegory.---Although extremely obscure, still the general subject and design are sufficiently evident.---A short and general analysis of the whole work; in which the obscurer passages are brought as little as possible in question.---The deductions from this disquisition -1. The subject of the controversy between Job and his friends .-2. The subject of the whole Poem .-3. Its end or purpose.---All questions not necessarily appertaining to this point to be avoided . SUCH a diversity of opinions has prevailed in the learned world concerning the nature and design of the Poem of Job, that the only point in which commentators seem to agree, is the extreme obscurity of the subject. To engage, therefore, in an undertaking on which so much erudition has been expended, to tread the same paths which so many have already traversed in vain, may seem to require some apology for the temerity, not to say the presumption of the attempt. Though I might alledge, that the authority of the most learned men is lessened in some measure by the discordance of their opinions; and that therefore the failure of others is the more readily to be excused; I will, however, make use of no such defence, but will entrench myself rather in the necessity and in the nature of my present undertaking. I pretend not to any new discoveries; I presume not to determine the subtile controversies of the learned; I scarcely venture to indulge the hope of being able to illustrate any obscurities. My sole intention is to collect, from such passages as appear the least intricate, the most probable conjectures: and what I conceive to have any tolerable foundation in fact, that I mean to propose, not as demonstration, but as opinion only. I proceed in this manner upon the principle, that, considering the great discordance of sentiments upon this subject, it would be impossible for any man to discourse with a sufficient degree of accuracy and perspicuity upon the structure and parts of this poem, unless he previously explained his own ideas concerning the scope and purport of the work in general. The book of Job appears to me to stand single and unparalleled in the Sacred Volume. It seems to have little connexion with the other writings of the Hebrews, and no relation whatever to the affairs of the Israelites. The scene is laid in Idum aea  600 ; the history of an inhabitant of that country is the basis of the narrative; the characters who speak are Idumaeans, or at least Arabians of the adjacent country, all originally of the race of Abraham. The language is pure Hebrew, although the author appears to be an Idumaean; for it is not improbable that all the posterity of Abraham, Israelites, Idumaeans, and Arabians, whether of the family of Keturah or Ishmael, spoke for a considerable length of time one common language. That the Idumaeans, however, and the Temanites in particular, were eminent for the reputation of wisdom, appears by the testimony of the prophets, Jeremiah and Obadiah  601 : Baruch also particularly mentions them amongst "the authors (or expounders) of fables, and searchers out of understanding  602 ." The learned are very much divided in their sentiments concerning the author of this book. Our Lightfoot conjectures, that it is the production of Elihu; and this conjecture seems at first sight rather countenanced by the exordium to the first speech of Elihu  603 , in which he seems to assume the character of the author, by continuing the narrative in his own person. That passage, however, which appears to interrupt the speech of Elihu, and to be a part of the narrative, is, I apprehend, nothing more than an apostrophe to Job, or possibly to himself; for it manifestly consists of two distichs, while, on the contrary, it is well known that all the narrative parts, all in which the author himself appears are certainly written in prose. Another opinion, which has been still more generally received, attributes the work to Moses. This conjecture, however, for I cannot dignify it with any higher appellation, will be found to rest altogether upon another, namely, that this poem was originally a consolatory address to the Israelites, and an allegorical representation of their situation: and I must confess, I can scarcely conceive any thing more futile than such an hypothesis, since it is impossible to trace, throughout the whole book, the slightest allusion to the manners, customs, ceremonies, or history of the Israelites. I will add, moreover, that the style of Job appears to me materially different from the poetical style of Moses; for it is much more compact, concise, or condensed, more accurate in the poetical conformation of the sentences: as may be observed also in the prophecies of Balaam, the Mesopotamian, a foreigner indeed with respect to the Israelites, but neither unacquainted with their language, nor with the worship of the true God. I confess myself therefore, on the whole, more inclined to favour the opinion of those who suppose Job himself, or some contemporary, to be the author of this poem: for that it is the most ancient of all the sacred books, is, I think, manifest, from the subject, the language, the general character, and even from the obscurity of the work  604 . Concerning the time also in which Job lived, although not directly specified, I see no great reason for doubt. The length of his life evinces that he was before Moses, and probably contemporary with the Patriarchs. Not however to dwell upon the innumerable hypotheses of the learned on this subject, I will only mention, that there is the utmost probabilty of his having lived prior to the promulgation of the law, from the nature of the sacrifice which he institutes conformably to the command of God, namely, seven oxen and seven rams; for it is plain from the example of Balaam, that a respect for that number prevailed in those countries, and at that period, from the traditional accounts which were still preserved among them of the seven days of creation  605 . The truth of the narrative would never, I am persuaded, have been called in question, but from the immoderate affection of some allegorizing mystics for their own fictions, which run to such excess, as to prevent them from acceding to any thing but what was visionary and typical. When I speak of the poem as founded in fact, I would be understood no further than concerns the general subject of the narrative, for I apprehend all the dialogue, and most likely some other parts, have partaken largely of the embellishments of poetry; but I cannot allow that this has by any means extended so far as to convert the whole into an allegory. Indeed I have not been able to trace any vestige of an allegorical meaning throughout the entire poem. And should even the exordium be suspected to be of this nature  606 , we must recollect, that the historical books are not destitute of similar narratives  607 . The exordium and conclusion I agree are distinct from the Poem itself, and stand in the place of an argument or illustration; that they are however coeval with the poetical part, and the work of the same author, is evident, since they are indispensibly necessary to the unravelling of the plot, which is not developed in the body of the poem. There are, it is true, phrases extant in the exordium, in which some critics have pretended to discover the hand of a later writer; the arguments, however, of these critics I cannot esteem of any great force or importance. That these points should be accounted of a very ambiguous nature, and should cause much embarrassment and controversy in the learned world, is nothing extraordinary; but that the main object and design of the poem should ever have been called in question, may justly excite our astonishment. For though many passages be confessedly obscure, though there be several which I fear no human skill will ever be able to unravel; and though the obscurity consist chiefly in the connexion of the incidents and the sentiments, it by no means necessarily follows, that the whole is involved in impenetrable darkness. The case indeed is far otherwise, for one and the same light, though at intervals overcast, shines on through the whole, and, like a conducting star, uniformly leads to the same point. If then any person will follow this guidance without perplexing himself with obscurities which he will occasionally meet, I have very little doubt but that he will clearly discern the end, the subject, the connexion, and arrangement of the whole work. It will, perhaps, be worth while to put to trial the efficacy of this maxim: let us, therefore, for the present, pass over those obscurities which might impede our progress; and, making the best use of those lights which are afforded by the more obvious passages, proceed with an attentive eye through the whole of the work, and observe whether something satisfactory is not to be discovered relating to the subject of the narrative, and the design and intent of the poem. The principal object held forth to our contemplation in this production is the example of a good man, eminent for his piety, and of approved integrity, suddenly precipitated from the very summit of prosperity into the lowest depths of misery and ruin: who having been first bereaved of his wealth, his possessions, and his children, is afterwards afflicted with the most excruciating anguish of a loathsome disease which entirely covers his body. He sustains all however with the mildest submission, and the most complete resignation to the will of Providence: "In all this," says the historian, "Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly  608 ." And after the second trial, "In all this did not Job sin with his lips  609 ." The author of the history remarks upon this circumstance a second time, in order to excite the observation of the reader, and to render him more attentive to what follows, which properly constitutes the true subject of the poem: namely, the conduct of Job with respect to his reverence for the Almighty, and the changes which accumulating misery might produce in his temper and behaviour. Accordingly we find that another still more exquisite trial of his patience yet awaits him, and which indeed, as the writer seems to intimate, he scarcely appears to have sustained with equal firmness, namely, the unjust suspicions, the bitter reproaches, and the violent altercations of his friends, who had visited him on the pretence of affording consolation. Here commences the plot or action of the Poem: for when, after a long silence of all parties, the grief of Job breaks forth into passionate exclamations, and a vehement execration on the day of his birth; the minds of his friends are suddenly exasperated, their intentions are changed, and their consolation, if indeed they originally intended any, is converted into contumely and reproaches. The first of these three singular comforters reproves his impatience; calls in question his integrity, by indirectly insinuating that God does not inflict such punishments upon the righteous; and finally, admonishes him, that the chastisement of God is not to be despised. The next of them, not less intemperate in his reproofs, takes it for granted, that the children of Job had only received the reward due to their offences; and with regard to himself, intimates, that if he be innocent, and will apply with proper humility to the divine mercy, he may be restored. The third upbraids him with arrogance, with vanity, and even with falsehood, because he has presumed to defend himself against the unjust accusations of his companions; and exhorts him to a sounder mode of reasoning and a more holy life. They all, with a manifest, though indirect allusion to Job, discourse very copiously concerning the divine judgments which are always openly displayed against the wicked, and of the certain destruction of hypocritical pretenders to virtue and religion. In reply to this, Job enumerates his sufferings, and complains bitterly of the inhumanity of his friends, and of the severity which he has experienced from the hand of God; he calls to witness both God and man, that he is unjustly oppressed; he intimates, that he is weak in comparison with God, that the contention is consequently unequal, and that be his cause ever so righteous he cannot hope to prevail. He expostulates with God himself still more vehemently, and with greater freedom, affirming, that he does not discriminate characters, but equally afflicts the just and the unjust. The expostulations of Job serve only to irritate still more the resentment of his pretended friends; they reproach him in severer terms with pride, impiety, passion, and madness: they repeat the same arguments respecting the justice of God, the punishment of the wicked, and their certain destruction after a short period of apparent prosperity. This sentiment they confidently pronounce to be confirmed both by their experience and by that of their fathers; and they maliciously exaggerate the ungrateful topic by the most splendid imagery and the most forcible language. On the part of Job, the general scope of the argument is much the same as before, but the expression is considerably heightened; it consists of appeals to the Almighty, asseverations of his own innocence, earnest expostulations, complaints of the cruelty of his friends, melancholy reflections on the vanity of human life, and upon his own severe misfortunes, ending in grief and desperation: he affirms, however, that he places his ultimate hope and confidence in God; and the more vehemently his adversaries urge, that the wicked only are objects of the divine wrath, and obnoxious to punishment, so much the more resolutely does Job assert their perpetual impunity, prosperity, and happiness even to the end of their existence  610 . The first of his opponents, Eliphaz, incensed by this assertion, descends directly to open crimination and contumely; he accuses the most upright of men of the most atrocious crimes, of injustice, rapine, and oppression; inveighs against him as an impious pretender to virtue and religion, and with a kind of sarcastic benevolence exhorts him to penitence. Vehemently affected with this reproof, Job, in a still more animated and confident strain, appeals to the tribunal of All-seeing Justice; and wishes it were only permitted him to plead his cause in the presence of God himself. He complains still more intemperately of the unequal treatment of Providence; exults in his own integrity, and then more tenaciously maintains his former opinion concerning the impunity of the wicked. To this another of the triumvirate, Bildad, replies, by a masterly, though concise dissertation on the majesty and sanctity of the Divine Being, indirectly rebuking the presumption of Job, who has dared to question his decrees. In reply to Bildad, Job demonstrates himself no less expert at wielding the weapons of satire and ridicule, than those of reason and argument; and reverting to a more serious tone, he displays the infinite power and wisdom of God more copiously, and more poetically than the former speaker. The third of the friends making no return, and the others remaining silent, Job at length opens the true sentiments of his heart concerning the fate of the wicked; he allows that their prosperity is unstable, and that they and their descendants shall at last experience on a sudden, that God is the avenger of iniquity. In all this, however, he contends that the divine counsels do not admit of human investigation; but that the chief wisdom of man consists in the fear of God. He beautifully descants upon his former prosperity; and exhibits a striking contrast between it and his present affliction and debasement. Lastly, in answer to the crimination of Eliphaz, and the implications of the others, he relates the principal transactions of his past life; he asserts his integrity as displayed in all the duties of life, and in the sight of God and man; and again appeals to the justice and omniscience of God in attestation of his veracity. If these circumstances be fairly collected from the general tenour and series of the work, as far as we are able to trace them through the plainer and more conspicuous passages, it will be no very difficult task to explain and define the subject of this part of the poem, which contains the dispute between Job and his friends. The argument seems chiefly to relate to the piety and integrity of Job, and turns upon this point, whether he, who by the Divine Providence and visitation is so severely punished and afflicted, ought to be accounted pious and innocent. This leads into a more extensive field of controversy, into a dispute indeed, which less admits of any definition or limit, concerning the nature of the divine counsels, in the dispensations of happiness and misery in this life. The antagonists of Job in this dispute observing him exposed to such severe visitations, conceiving that this affliction has not fallen upon him unmeritedly, accuse him of hypocrisy, and falsely ascribe to him the guilt of some atrocious but concealed offence. Job, on the contrary, conscious of no crime, and wounded by their unjust suspicions, defends his own innocence before God with rather more confidence and ardour than is commendable; and so strenuously contends for his own integrity, that he seems virtually to charge God himself with some degree of injustice. This state of the controversy is clearly explained by what follows: for when the three friends have ceased to dispute with Job, "because he seemeth just in his own eyes  611 ," that is, because he has uniformly contended, that there was no wickedness in himself which could call down the heavy vengeance of God; Elihu comes forward justly offended with both parties; with Job, because "he justified himself in preference to God  612 ," that is, because he defended so vehemently the justice of his own cause, that he seemed in some measure to arraign the justice of God; against the three friends, because, "though they were unable to answer Job, they ceased not to condemn him  613 :" that is, they concluded in their own minds, that Job was impious and wicked, while, nevertheless, they had nothing specific to object against his assertions of his own innocence, or upon which they might safely ground their accusation. The conduct of Elihu evidently corresponds with this state of the controversy: he professes, after a slight prefatory mention of himself, to reason with Job, unbiassed equally by favour or resentment. He therefore reproves Job from his own mouth, because he had attributed too much to himself; because he had affirmed himself to be altogether free from guilt and depravity; because he had presumed to contend with God, and had not scrupled to insinuate, that the Deity was hostile to him. He asserts, that it is not necessary for God to explain and develope his counsels to men; that he nevertheless takes many occasions of admonishing them, not only by visions and revelations, but even by the visitations of his Providence, by sending calamities and diseases upon them, to repress their arrogance and reform their obduracy. He next rebukes Job, because he had pronounced himself upright, and affirmed that God had acted inimically, if not unjustly towards him, which he proves to be no less improper than indecent. In the third place, he objects to Job, that from the miseries of the good, and the prosperity of the wicked, he has falsely and perversely concluded, that there was no advantage to be derived from the practice of virtue. On the contrary he affirms, that when the afflictions of the just continue, it is because they do not place a proper confidence in God, ask relief at his hands, patiently expect it, nor demean themselves before him with becoming humility and submission. This observation alone, he adds very properly, is at once a sufficient reproof of the contumacy of Job, and a full refutation of the unjust suspicions of his friends  614 . Lastly, he explains the purposes of the Deity in chastening men, which are in general to prove and to amend them, to repress their arrogance, to afford him an opportunity of exemplifying his justice upon the obstinate and rebellious, and of shewing favour to the humble and obedient. He supposes God to have acted in this manner towards Job; on that account he exhorts him to humble himself before his righteous Judge, to beware of appearing obstinate or contumacious in his sight, and of relapsing into a repetition of his sin. He intreats him, from the contemplation of the divine power and majesty to endeavour to retain a proper reverence for the Almighty. To these frequently intermitted and often repeated admonitions of Elihu, Job makes no return. The oration of God himself follows that of Elihu, in which disdaining to descend to any particular explication of his divine counsels, but instancing some of the stupendous effects of his infinite power, he insists upon the same topics which Elihu had before touched upon. In the first place, having reproved the temerity of Job, he convicts him of ignorance, in being unable to comprehend the works of his creation, which were obvious to every eye; the nature and structure of the earth, the sea, the light, and the animal kingdom. He then demonstrates his weakness, by challenging him to prove his own power by emulating any single exertion of the divine energy, and then referring him to one or two of the brute creation, with which he is unable to contend---how much less therefore with the omnipotent Creator and Lord of all things, who is or can be accountable to no being whatever  615 ? On this Job humbly submits to the will of Providence, acknowledges his own ignorance and imbecility, and "repents in dust and ashes." On a due consideration of all these circumstances, the principal object of the poem seems to be this third and last trial of Job, from the injustice and unkindness of his accusing friends. The consequence of which is, in the first place, the anger, indignation, and contumacy of Job, and afterwards his composure, submission, and penitence. The design of the poem is, therefore, to teach men, that having a due respect to the corruption, infirmity, and ignorance of human nature, as well as to the infinite wisdom and majesty of God, they are to reject all confidence in their own strength, in their own righteousness, and to preserve on all occasions an unwavering and unsullied faith, and to submit with becoming reverence to his decrees. I would wish it, however, to be carefully observed, that the subject of the dispute between Job and his friends differs from the subject of the poem in general: that the end of the poetical part is different from the design of the narrative at large. For although the design and subject of the poem be exactly as I have defined them, it may nevertheless be granted, that the whole history, taken together, contains an example of patience, together with its reward. This point not having been treated with sufficient distinctness by the learned, I cannot help esteeming it the principal cause of the perplexity in which the subject has been involved. I am not ignorant, that to those who enter upon this inquiry, some questions will occur, which appear to require a separate examination; since many of them, however, are chiefly connected with those passages which are acknowledged to be obscure, which have not yet been clearly explained, and which, whatever they may hereafter be found to import, are not likely to affect the truth of our conclusion, I have thought proper to omit them. Nor will I allow, that because many things yet remain ambiguous and perplexed, we are therefore to doubt of those which are more open and evident. In regard to certain more important doctrines, which some persons of distinguished learning have thought to be established by this extraordinary monument of ancient wisdom, as they either depend in a great degree on the obscure passages above- mentioned, or do not seem to contribute in the least to the main design of the Poem, nor to be consistent with the object of it, which I just now pointed out, I thought it still more unnecessary to introduce them in this disquisition. What I have advanced, I conceived fully adequate to the purpose of this undertaking, and a sufficient introduction to a critical examination of the composition and beauties of the poem. The Poem of Job commonly accounted Dramatic; and thought by many to be of the same kind with the Greek Tragedy: this opinion examined .--- A plot or fable essential to a regular drama; its definition and essential qualities according to Aristotle .--- Demonstrated, that the Poem of Job does not contain any plot: its form and design more fully explained .--- Compared with the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles; with the Oedipus Coloneus; and shewn to differ entirely from both in form and manner .--- It is nevertheless a most beautiful and perfect performance in its kind: it approaches very near the form of a perfect Drama; and, for regularity in form and arrangement, justly claims the first place among the poetical compositions of the Hebrews . WHEN I undertook the present investigation, my principal object was to enable us to form some definite opinion concerning the Poem of Job, and to assign it its proper place among the compositions of the Hebrew Poets. This will possibly appear to some a superfluous and idle undertaking, as the point seems long since to have been finally determined, the majority of the critics having decidedly adjudged it to belong to the dramatic class. Since, however, the term dramatic, as I formerly had reason to remark, is in itself extremely ambiguous, the present disquisition will not be confined within the limits of a single question; for the first object of inquiry will necessarily be, what idea is affixed to the appellation by those critics who term the book of Job a Dramatic Poem: and after we have determined this point (if it be possible to determine it, for they do not seem willing to be explicit) we may then with safety proceed to enquire whether, pursuant to that idea, the piece be justly entitled to this appellation. A poem is called dramatic, either in consequence of its form, the form I mean of a perfect dialogue, which is sustained entirely by the characters or personages without the intervention of the Poet; and this was the definition adopted by the ancient critics: or else, according to the more modern acceptation of the word, in consequence of a plot or fable being represented in it. If those who account the book of Job dramatic adhere to the former definition, I have little inclination to litigate the point; and indeed the object of the controversy would scarcely be worth the labour. Though a critic, if disposed to be scrupulously exact, might insist that the work, upon the whole, is by no means a perfect dialogue, but consists of a mixture of the narrative and colloquial style: for the historical part, which is all composed in the person of the writer himself, is certainly to be accounted a part of the work itself, considered as a whole. Since, however, on the other hand, the historical or narrative part is all evidently written in prose, and seems to me to be substituted merely in the place of an argument or comment, for the purpose of explaining the rest, and certainly does not constitute any part of the poem; since, moreover, those short sentences, which serve to introduce the different speeches, contain very little more than the names, I am willing to allow, that the structure or form of this poem is on the whole dramatic. But this concession will, I fear, scarcely satisfy the critics in question; for they speak of the regular order and conduct of the piece, and of the dramatic catastrophe; they assert, that the interposition of the Deity is a necessary part of the machinery of the fable; they even enumerate the acts and scenes, and use the very same language in all respects, as if they spoke of a Greek Tragedy; insomuch, that when they term the Poem of Job dramatic  616 , they seem to speak of that species of drama which was cultivated and improved in the theatre of Athens. It appears therefore a fair object of inquiry, whether the Poem of Job be possessed of the peculiar properties of the Greek drama, and may with reason and justice be classed with the theatrical productions of that people. We have already agreed, that the greater and more perfect Drama is peculiarly distinguished from the lesser and more common species, inasmuch as it retains not only the dramatic form, or the perfect dialogue, but also exhibits some entire action, fable, or plot. And this is perfectly agreeable to the definition of Aristotle; for although he points out many parts or constituents in the composition of a Tragedy, he assigns the first place to the plot or fable  617 . This he says is the beginning, this the end, this is the most important part, the very soul of a Tragedy, without which it is utterly undeserving of the name, and indeed cannot properly be said to exist. A plot or fable is the representation of an action or event, or of a series of events or incidents tending all to one point, which are detailed with a view to a particular object or conclusion. A Tragedy, says the same author, is not a representation of men, but of actions, a picture of life, of prosperity and adversity: in other words, the business of the poem is not merely to exhibit manners only, nor does the most perfect representation of manners constitute a Tragedy; for in reality a Tragedy may exist with little or no display of manners or character, its business is to exhibit life and action, or some regular train of actions and events, on which depends the felicity or infelicity of the persons concerned. For human happiness or prosperity consists in action; and action is not a quality, but is the end of man. According to our manners we are denominated good or bad, but we are happy or unhappy, prosperous or unsuccessful, according to actions or events. Poets therefore do not form a plot or action merely for the sake of imitating manners or character; but manners and character are added to the plot, and for the sake of it are chiefly attended to. Thus far he has accurately drawn the line between the representation of action and that of manners. He adds, moreover, that unity is essential to a regular plot or action, and that it must be complete in itself, and of a proper length  618 . But to comprehend more perfectly the nature of a plot or fable, it must be observed, that there are two principal species: for they are either complex or simple  619 ; the former contains some unexpected vicissitude of fortune, such as the recognition of a person at first unknown, the recovery of a lost child, or a sudden change in the situation of the parties, or perhaps both; the latter contains nothing of the kind, but proceeds in one uniform and equal tenour. In every plot or fable, however, be it ever so simple, and though it contain nothing of the wonderful or unexpected, there is always a perplexity or embarrassment, as also a regular solution or catastrophe  620 ; the latter must proceed from the former, and indeed must depend upon it; which cannot be the case, unless there be a certain order or connexion in the incidents and events which inclines them towards the same end, and combines them all in one termination. On fairly considering these circumstances, I have no hesitation in affirming, that the Poem of Job contains no plot or action whatever, not even of the most simple kind; it uniformly exhibits one constant state of things, not the smallest change of fortune taking place from the beginning to the end; and it contains merely a representation of those manners, passions, and sentiments, which might actually be expected in such a situation. Job is represented as reduced from the summit of human prosperity, to a condition the most miserable and afflicted: and the sentiments of both Job and his friends are exactly such as the occasion dictates. For here a new temptation falls upon him, by which the constancy of Job is put to the severest trial; and this circumstance it is that constitutes the principal subject of the Poem. Job had, we find, endured the most grievous calamities, the loss of his wealth, the deprivation of his children, and the miserable union of poverty and disease, with so much fortitude and with so just a confidence in his own integrity, that nothing could be extorted from him in the least inconsistent with the strictest reverence for the Divine Being; he is now put to the proof, whether, after enduring all this with firmness and resignation, he can with equal patience endure to have his innocence and virtue (in which perhaps he had placed too much confidence) indirectly questioned, and even in plain terms arraigned. Job now sinking under the weight of his misery, laments his condition with more vehemence than before. His friends reprove his impatience, and drop some dark insinuations to the apparent disparagement of his virtue and integrity, by entering into very copious declamations concerning the justice of God in proportioning his visitations to the crimes of men. Job is still more violently agitated; and his friends accuse him with less reserve. He appeals to God, and expostulates with some degree of freedom. They urge and press him in the very heat of his passion; and, by still more malignant accusations, excite his indignation and his confidence, which were already too vehement. Elihu interposes as an arbiter of the controversy; he reproves the severe spirit of the friends, as well as the presumption of Job, who trusted too much in his own righteousness. Job receives his admonitions with mildness and temper, and being rendered more sedate by his expostulation, makes no reply, though the other appears frequently to expect it. When the Almighty, however, condescends to set before him his rashness, frailty, and ignorance, he submits in perfect humility, and with sincere repentance. Here the temptation of Job concludes, in the course of which there was great reason to apprehend he would be totally vanquished: at the same time the Poem necessarily terminates, the state of things still remaining without any change or vicissitude whatever. The Poem indeed contains a great variety of sentiment, excellent representations of manners and character, remarkable efforts of passion, much important controversy; but no change of fortune, no novelty of incident, no plot, no action. If indeed we rightly consider, we shall, I dare believe, find that the very nature of the subject excludes even the possibility of a plot or action. From that state of settled and unvarying misery in which Job is involved, arises the doubt of his integrity, and those insinuations and criminations which serve to exasperate him, and by which he is stimulated to expostulate with God, and to glory in his own righteousness. It was proper, therefore, that by a continuance of the same state and condition, he should be recalled to and humble spirit, and to a proper reverence for the Almighty Providence. For it would have been altogether contrary to what is called poetical justice, if he had been restored to prosperity previous to his submission and penitence. The repentance of Job, however, we find concludes the Poem. Nor was it at all necessary, that the question concerning the divine justice should be resolved in the body of the work, either by the fortunate issue of the affairs of Job, or even by the explication of the divine intentions: this, in fact, was not the primary object, nor does it at all constitute the subject of the Poem; but is subservient, or in a manner an appendage to it. The disputation which takes place upon this topic, is no more than an instrument of temptation, and is introduced in order to explain the inmost sentiments of Job, and to lay open the latent pride that existed in his soul. The Almighty, therefore, when he addresses Job, pays little regard to this point; nor indeed was it necessary, for neither the nature nor the object of the Poem required a defence of the Divine Providence, but merely a reprehension of the over-confidence of Job. If indeed we suppose any change to have taken place in the state of affairs, the nature and subject of the Poem will also be changed. If we connect with the poetical part either the former or the latter part of the history, or both, the subject will then be the display of a perfect example of patience in enduring the severest outward calamities, and at length receiving an ample reward at the hands of the Almighty: from this, however, the universal tenour of the Poem will be found greatly to differ. It will be found to exhibit rather the impatience of Job in bearing the reproaches and abuse of his pretended friends: and this appears to lead to the true object of the Poem; for Job is irritated, he indulges his passion, he speaks too confidently of his own righteousness, and in too irreverend a style concerning the justice of God; in the end, he is converted by the admonitions of Elihu, and the reproofs of his omnipotent Creator. The true object of the Poem appears therefore to be, to demonstrate the necessity of humility, of trust in God, and of the profoundest reverence for the divine decrees, even in the holiest and most exalted characters. Should it be objected, that I have contended with a scrupulous perverseness concerning the meaning of a word; and should it after all be affirmed, that this very temptation of Job, this dispute itself possesses in some degree the form or appearance of an action: I am content to submit the trial to another issue, and to be judged by a fair investigation of the practice of the Greek Poets upon similar occasions. There is no necessity to remind this assembly, with how much art and design the fable or plot of the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles appears to have been constructed; with what powers of imagination and judgment the process of the drama is conducted; and in what manner, by a regular succession of events, arising naturally from each other, the horrid secret is developed, which as soon as disclosed precipitates the hero of the Tragedy from the summit of human happiness into the lowest depths of misery and ruin. Let us only suppose Sophocles to have treated the same subject in a different manner, and to have formed a poem on that part of the story alone which is comprized in the last act. Here Oedipus would be indeed exhibited as an object of the most tender compassion; here would be a spacious field for the display of the most interesting and tragical affections: the fatal catastrophe would be deplored; the blindness, disgrace, exile of the hero, would enhance the distress of the scene; and to the bitterness of present calamity would be added the still more bitter remembrance of the past. The poet might copiously display the sorrow and commiseration of his daughters, his detestation of himself, and of all that belong to him, and more copiously, of those who had preserved him when exposed, who had supported and educated him: all these topics the Poet has slightly touched upon in these lines, O curst Cithaeron! why didst thou receive me? Or when thou didst, how could'st thou not destroy me? The succeeding passages are also extremely pathetic. These would easily admit of amplification, and, when the ardour of grief was a little abated, he might have added his vindication of himself, his asseverations of his innocence, his plea of ignorance, and fatal necessity, and his impassioned exclamations against Fortune and the Gods. From all this might be constructed a Poem, great, splendid, copious, diversified; and the subject would also furnish a topic of disputation not unlike that of Job. It might also assume in some measure the dramatic form; the same characters that appear in the Tragedy might be introduced; it might possess the exact proportions and all the requisites of a drama, fable alone excepted, which indeed constitutes the very essence of a Dramatic Poem, and without which all other qualities are of no avail: for the Greeks would have called such a production a Monody, or Elegiac Dialogue, or any thing but a Tragedy. This opinion receives still further confirmation from the example and authority of Sophocles himself in another instance. For when he again introduces the same Oedipus upon the stage in another Tragedy, though the ground-work of the piece be nearly that which we have been describing, the conduct of it is totally different. This piece is called Oedipus Coloneus; the plot or fable is quite simple, on which account it is a fairer object of comparison with the Poem of Job than any the plot of which is more complex. Oedipus is introduced blind, exiled, and oppressed with misery: none of those circumstances above-mentioned have escaped the Poet; such as the lamentation of his misery, the passionate exclamations against Fate and the Gods, and the vindication of his innocence. These, however, do not form the basis of the Poem; they are introduced merely as circumstances, which afford matter of amplification, and which seem to flow from that elegant plot or action he has invented. Oedipus, led by his daughter, arrives at Colonus, there to die and be interred according to the admonition of the Oracle; for upon these circumstances the victory of the Athenians over the Thebans was made to depend. The place being accounted sacred, the Athenians are unwilling to receive him; but Theseus affords him refuge and protection. Another of his daughters is introduced, who informs him of the discord between her brothers, also that Creon is coming, with an intention of bringing him back to his own country in pursuance of a decree of the Thebans. After this Creon arrives; he endeavours to persuade Oedipus to return to Thebes; and on his refusal, attempts to make use of violence. Theseus protects Oedipus: and in the mean time Polynices arrives, with a view of bringing over his father to his party in the war against the Thebans: this being the only condition on which he was to hope for victory. Oedipus refuses, and execrates his son in the severest terms: in conclusion, the answer of the Oracle being communicated to Theseus, Oedipus dies, and is secretly buried there. In this manner is constructed a regular, perfect, and important action or plot; all the parts of which are connected together in one design, and tend exactly to the same conclusion, and in which are involved the fates of both Thebes and Athens. The manners, passions, characters, and sentiments, serve to adorn, but not to support the fable. Without any striking representation of these, the plot or action would still remain, and would of itself sustain the Tragedy; but if the action be removed, though all the rest remain, it is evident that the Tragedy is totally annihilated. From these observations it will, I think, be evident, that the Poem of Job cannot properly be brought into comparison with either Oedipus of Sophocles, or with any other of the Greek Tragedies. It will be evident, I think, that this Poem ought not to be accounted of the same kind; nor can possibly be classed with them, unless the whole nature and form of either the Greek or the Hebrew Poem be changed; or unless the plot or action be taken from the one, or added to the other: for without this great essential no Poem can indeed be accounted a perfect drama. But though I have urged thus much against its claim to that title, let it not be understood that I wish to derogate from its merits. That censure will rather apply to those who, by criticising it according to foreign and improper rules, would make that composition appear lame and imperfect, which on the contrary is in its kind most beautiful and perfect. If indeed the extreme antiquity of this Poem, the obscurity and the difficulty that necessarily ensue from that circumstance be considered; and if allowance be made for the total want of plot and action, we shall have cause to wonder at the elegance and interest which we find in its form, conduct, and economy. The arrangement is perfectly regular, and every part is admirably adapted to its end and design. The antiquary or the critic, who has been at the pains to trace the history of the Grecian drama from its first weak and imperfect efforts, and has carefully observed its tardy progress to perfection  621 , will scarcely, I think, without astonishment contemplate a Poem produced so many ages before, so elegant in its design, so regular in its structure, so animated, so affecting, so near to the true dramatic model: while, on the contrary, the united wisdom of Greece, after ages of study, was not able to produce any thing approaching to perfection in this walk of poetry before the time of Æschylus. But however this be---whatever rank may be assigned to Job, in a comparison with the Poets of Greece, to whom we must at least allow the merit of art and method; amongst the Hebrews, it must certainly be allowed, in this respect, to be unrivalled. It is of little consequence whether it be esteemed a didactic or an ethic, a pathetic or dramatic Poem; only let it be assigned a distinct and conspicuous station in the highest rank of the Hebrew Poetry. Though the Poem of Job do not contain a plot or fable, it possesses, nevertheless, some things in common with the perfect drama .--- Manners or character.---The manners of Job; to be distinguished from the passions or emotions.---The opinion of Aristotle, that the character of extreme virtue is not proper for Tragedy, demonstrated to be neither applicable to Job, nor true with respect to Tragedy in general. ---The design of the Poem.---The manners of the three friends: the gradations of passion more strongly marked in them than the diversity of manners.---Elihu.---The expostulation of God himself .--- Sentiments ; expressive of things and of manners; the latter already noticed; the former consist partly of passion, partly of description: two examples of the softer passions: examples of description.--- The Style of this Poem uncommonly elegant and sublime; and the poetic conformation of the sentences extremely correct. ---Peroration, recommending the study of Hebrew literature  . WHEN I contended that the Poem of Job ought not to be accounted a true and regular drama, such as are the Tragedies of the Greeks, I was far from insinuating, that it did not possess the dramatic form. I not only allowed, that in its general conduct and economy it exhibited a similitude, an anticipation as it were of genuine Tragedy; but that it contained also all the principal requisites of a dramatic Poem, fable alone excepted: of these the first and most important is, the imitation of manners or character. The manners are what serve to mark or discriminate the different persons, who take a part in the action of the Poem, to declare and express each character's peculiar mode of speaking, thinking, and acting; and compose as it were the intellectual image of the man. The principal personage in this Poem is Job, and in his character is meant to be exhibited (as far as is consistent with human infirmity) an example of perfect virtue. This is intimated in the argument or introduction, but is still more eminently displayed by his own actions and sentiments. He is holy, devout, and most piously and reverently impressed with the sacred awe of his divine Creator; he is also upright, and conscious of his own integrity; he is patient of evil, and yet very remote from that insensibility or rather stupidity to which the Stoic school pretended. Oppressed therefore with unparalleled misfortunes, he laments his misery, and even wishes a release by death; in other words, he obeys, and gives place to the dictates of nature: irritated, however, by the unjust insinuations, and the severe reproaches of his pretended friends, he is more vehemently exasperated, and the too great confidence in his own righteousness leads him to expostulate with God in terms scarcely consistent with piety and strict decorum. It must be observed, that the first speech of Job, though it burst forth with all the vehemence of passion, consists wholly of complaint, "the words and sentiments of a despairing person, empty as the wind  622 ;" which is indeed the apology that he immediately makes for his conduct; intimating, that he is far from presuming to plead with God, far from daring to call in question the divine decrees, or even to mention his own innocence in the presence of his all-just Creator: nor I do see any good reason for the censure which has been passed by some commentators upon this passage. The Poet seems, with great judgment and ingenuity, to have performed in this what the nature of his work required. He has depicted the affliction and anguish of Job, as flowing from his wounded heart in a manner so agreeable to human nature (and certainly so far venial) that it may be truly said, "in all this Job sinned not with his lips." It is, nevertheless, embellished by such affecting imagery, and inspired with such a warmth and force of sentiment, that we find it afforded ample scope for calumny; nor did the unkind witnesses of his sufferings permit so fair an opportunity to escape. The occasion is eagerly embraced by Eliphaz, to rebuke the impatience of Job; and, not satisfied with this, he proceeds to accuse him in direct terms of wanting fortitude, and obliquely to insinuate something of a deeper dye. Though deeply hurt with the coarse reproaches of Eliphaz, still, however, when Job afterwards complains of the severity of God, he cautiously refrains from violent expostulations with his Creator, and contented with the simple expression of affliction, he humbly confesses himself a sinner  623 . Hence, I think, it is evident, that those vehement and perverse attestations of his innocence, those murmurs against the divine Providence, which his tottering virtue afterwards permits, are to be considered merely as the consequences of momentary passion, and not as the ordinary effects of his settled character or manners. They prove him at the very worst not an irreligious man, but a man possessed of integrity, and too confident of it; a man oppressed with almost every imaginable evil, both corporal and mental, and hurried beyond the limits of virtue by the strong influence of pain and affliction. When, on the contrary, his importunate visitors abandon by silence the cause which they had so wantonly and so maliciously maintained; and cease unjustly to load him with unmerited criminations; though he defends his argument with scarcely less obstinacy; yet the vehemence of his grief appears gradually to subside, he returns to himself, and explain his sentiments with more candour and sedateness: and however we may blame him for assuming rather too much of arrogance in his appeals to the Almighty, certainly his defence against the accusations of Eliphaz, is no more than the occasion will strictly justify. Observe, in the first place, how admirably the confidence and perseverance of Job is displayed in replying to the slander of his false friends: "As God liveth, who hath removed my judgment; Nay, as the Almighty liveth, who hath embittered my soul; Verily as long as I have life in me, And the breath of God is in my nostrils; My lips shall not speak perversity, Neither shall my tongue whisper prevarication. God forbid that I should declare you righteous! Till I expire I will not remove my integrity from me. I have fortified myself in my righteousness, And I will not give up my station; My heart shall not upbraid me as long as I live. May mine enemy be as the impious man, And he that riseth up against me as the wicked  624 ." But how magnificent, how noble, how inviting and beautiful is that image of virtue, in which he delineates his past life! What dignity and authority does he seem to possess! "If I came out to the gate, nigh the place of public resort, If I took up my seat in the street; The young men saw me, and they hid themselves; Nay, the very old men rose up and stood  625 . The princes refrained talking, Nay, they laid their hands on their mouths. The nobles held their peace, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth  626 ." What liberality! what a promptitude in benificence! "Because the ear heard, therefore it blessed me; The eye also saw, therefore it bare testimony for me. That I delivered the poor who cried, The orphan also, and him who had no helper. The blessing of him who was ready to perish came upon me, And I caused the heart of the widow to sing for joy  627 ." What sanctity, what integrity in a judicial capacity! "I put on righteousness, and it clothed me like a robe; My justice also was a diadem. I was a father to the poor, And the controversy which I knew not, I searched it out. Then brake I the grinders of the oppressor, And I plucked the prey out of his teeth  628 ." But what can be more engaging than the purity of his devotion, and his reverence for the Supreme Being, founded upon the best and most philosophical principles? Besides that through the whole there runs a strain of the most amiable tenderness and humanity: "For what is the portion which God distributeth from above, And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high? Is it not destruction to the wicked, And banishment  629 from their country to the doers of iniquity? Doth he not see my ways? And numbereth he not all my steps? If I should despise the cause of my servant, Or my maid, when they had a controversy with me, What then should I do when God ariseth, And when he visiteth, what answer could I make him? Did not he who formed me in the belly form him, And did not One fashion us in the womb 630 ?" Aristotle has remarked, that the example of a singularly good man falling from prosperous circumstances into misfortune, is by no means a proper subject for a Tragedy  631 ; since it is offensive and indecent rather than piteous or terrible  632 . This remark, though consistent enough with the Greek drama, and with the sentiments and manners of the Heathens, is scarcely applicable to our Tragedy, and still less to the Poem of Job. "Pity," says the same author on another occasion, "is excited when adversity falls upon those who are undeserving of it." Great virtue therefore plunged into great misfortunes, so far from being an unsuitable subject, ought to be the most direct and proper means of moving compassion. "Terror is excited by a representation of the misery of such persons as bear the nearest resemblance to ourselves:" the misfortunes therefore of those, who are vicious in an extreme, are not much calculated to excite terror; but this is by no means the case with regard to the misery of such as are eminently good; for if we fear for ourselves when we see moderate virtue in affliction, much more, surely, when a superior degree of it is in that state  633 . It appears to me, therefore, that Aristotle was not of opinion, that the example of a very good man in extreme affliction is ill calculated to excite either pity or terror; but rather it is a spectacle likely to prove injurious to the cause of virtue, and therefore disgusting and detestable, and consequently unfit to be produced upon the stage. This opinion of the philosopher seems to result from an unjust and visionary estimation of human virtue, to repress which appears to have been the very design and object of the book of Job. The character of Job indeed, though approaching so near to the perfection of virtue, seems, notwithstanding, to have a considerable alloy of human infirmity, so as neither to want probability, nor to lose its effect in exciting terror. For if it be extreme wickedness in the most upright of men, when oppressed with the severest misery, to murmur at all against the divine justice, who then shall stand before God? Who shall expect to pass through the pilgrimage of life without his portion of evil and of sin? The end of the Poem is moreover by no means ill calculated to excite terror; since this moral is particularly inculcated in it, "Be not high-minded, but fear:" and Job himself sets before us, what impression the example of his misfortunes ought to make upon our minds in this respect: "The upright will be astonished at this, Then the innocent will surely rise up against the profligate; The righteous man will also hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands will gather strength 634 ." The three friends are exactly such characters as the nature of the Poem required. They are severe, irritable, malignant censors, readily and with apparent satisfaction deviating from the purpose of consolation into reproof and contumely. Even from the very first they manifest this evil propensity, and indicate what is to be expected from them. The first of them, indeed, in the opening of his harangue, assumes an air of candour: "Wouldst thou take it unkindly that one should essay to speak to thee  635 ?" Indignation is, however, instantly predominant: "But a few words who can forbear?" The second flames forth at once: "How long wilt thou trifle in this manner? How long shall the words of thy mouth be as a mighty wind  636 ?" But remark the third: "Shall not the master of words be answered? Or shall a man be acquitted for his fine speeches? Shall thy prevarications make men silent; Shalt thou even scoff, and there be no one to make thee ashamed  637 ?" They are represented as illiberal, contentious; inclined to torture every thing to the worst of purposes: "Doth God pervert judgment? Doth the Almighty pervert justice  638 ?" Where observe, Job has not as yet uttered an intemperate expression in disparagement of the divine justice. "Nay, thou castest off fear, And thou restrainest prayer before God  639 :" Such is the invective of the other of them. They are also proud, contemptuous, and arrogate too much to their own wisdom: "Why are we accounted as beasts; Why are we vile in your eyes? Let him tear himself in his fury; What, shall the earth be forsaken for thee  640 ? "What though Mahammed were dead? His Imauns (or ministers) conducted the affairs of the nation. The universe shall not fall for his sake. The world does not subsist for one man alone. Nay, this very phrase is still in use among the Arabic writers, [Hebrew text]  641 "the earth is desolate."     Gol . Col. 1570. H. "Or shall the rock be outrooted from its place? Rather let the light of the wicked be extinguished ." Nor is Zophar, who takes up the subject after Bildad, more modest: "Verily the impulse of my thoughts incite me to reply, Even because there is some resentment within me: I hear the ignominious reproof that is aimed at me, And the spirit within me compels me to answer  642 ." The conduct of all these malicious censors is much the same through the whole piece. Eliphaz indeed, who begins in the mildest terms, descends afterwards to the severest reproaches; and he directly charges Job with the most atrocious offences: from which intemperance of language, it must be confessed, the others refrain. Bildad, not to be silent, repeats in a brief and florid manner the subject, which had already been twice treated of by the others, namely, the majesty and holiness of God; and Zophar, withdrawing from the contest, deserts entirely the cause of his companion, and leaves the field to Job. The business of defamation indeed seems, with great propriety, committed to three persons. It would have been too confined and trivial in the hands of one; and, amongst a croud of accusers, too confused and clamorous. There appears, however, but little difference in the manners of the three friends; for in them the poet has rather studied to display the progress of the passions, than any diversity of character. But though the nice and fastidious criticism of the moderns demand variety in this respect, the simplicity of infant Poetry will be excused by every person of real judgment; and I think this deficiency (if such it may be called) is amply compensated by the gravity and importance of the subject and sentiments. The lenity and moderation of Elihu serves as a beautiful contrast to the intemperance and asperity of the other three. He is pious, mild, and equitable; equally free from adulation and severity; and endued with singular wisdom, which he attributes entirely to the inspiration of God: and his modesty, moderation, and wisdom, are the more entitled to commendation when we consider his unripe youth. As the characters of his detractors were in all respects calculated to inflame the mind of Job; that of this arbitrator is admirably adapted to sooth and compose it: to this point the whole drift of the argument tends, and on this the very purport of it seems to depend. The interposition of the Deity, and its connexion with the general design of the Poem, I have formerly noticed. I will only add, that although some critics have really thought the whole address inconsistent, and foreign to the subject, no man has ever accounted it in any respect unworthy of that supreme Majesty to which it is ascribed. Another circumstance deserving particular attention in a Poem of this kind, is the sentiment; which must be agreeable to the subject, and embellished with proper expression. It is by Aristotle enumerated among the essentials of a Dramatic Poem; not indeed as peculiar to that species of Poetry alone, but as common, and of the greatest importance to all. Manners or character are essential only to that poetry in which living persons are introduced; and all such Poems must afford an exact representation of human manners: but sentiment is essential to every Poem, indeed to every composition whatever. It respects both persons and things; as far as it regards persons, it is particularly concerned in the delineation of the manners and passions: and those instances to which I have just been adverting, are sentiments expressive of manners. Those which relate to the delineation of the passions, and to the description of other objects, yet remain unnoticed in this Lecture. As I formerly, however, treated of these subjects in general, I could scarcely avoid producing some examples from this Poem; for in demonstrating the power of the poetic diction in exciting the passions, I could not possibly deduce my instances from a better source  643 . On the present occasion, therefore, I shall study brevity, and avoid as much as possible the tediousness of repetition. The Poem of Job abounds chiefly in the more vehement passions, grief and anger, indignation and violent contention. It is adapted in every respect to the incitement of terror; and, as the specimens already quoted will sufficiently prove, is universally animated with the true spirit of sublimity. It is however not wanting in the gentler affections; the following complaints, for instance, are replete with an affecting spirit of melancholy: "Man, the offspring of a woman, Is of few days, and full of inquietude; He springeth up, and is cut off like a flower; He fleeteth like a shadow, and doth not abide: Upon such a creature dost thou open thine eyes? And wilt thou bring even me into judgment with Thee? Turn thy look from him, that he may have some respite, Till he shall, like a hireling, have completed  644 his day  645 ." The whole passage abounds with the most beautiful imagery, and is a most perfect specimen of the Elegiac. His grief afterwards becomes more fervent; but is at the same time soft and querimonious. "How long will ye vex my soul, And tire me with vain harangues? These ten times have ye loaded me with reproaches, Are ye not ashamed that ye are so obstinate against me  646 ? Pity me, O pity me, ye are my friends, For the hand of God hath smitten me. Why will you be my persecutors as well as God, And therefore will ye not be satisfied with my flesh  647 ?" That self-indulgence which is so natural to the passion of Hope; its ingenuity in drawing pictures of future felicity; its credulity in cherishing these ideas, and the gaiety and elevation of mind with which it describes them, are finely expressed by Job in the passage immediately following the relation of his past life: "Therefore I said I shall die in my nest; I shall multiply my days like the sand: My root was spread abroad nigh the waters, And the dew lay all night on my branches: My glory was fresh within me, And my bow gained strength in my hand. They hearkned to me, nay they waited for me; They were silent also, they approved my counsel. After I had spoken they replied not; For my words dropped upon them: They waited also for me as the rain; And their mouths were open as for the latter rain  648 ." To this part of the subject, which relates to the delineation of the passions, may be referred those delicate touches which animate almost every description, and which are drawn from the most intimate knowledge of the genuine emotions of the human soul. I shall content myself with one example out of the many which the compass of the work affords. It is exactly copied from Nature; for when events take place according to our ardent wishes, but quite contrary to our expectations, we have the utmost difficulty to believe them real. Job thus expresses himself respecting God: "If I called upon him and he should answer me, Yet could I scarcely believe that he had heard my voice  649 ." This is admirably expressive both of the majesty of God, and of the severity which he exercised towards Job; it is also no less descriptive of the humiliation and despair of the sufferer. "If I were merry with them they would not believe it  650 :" says Job of his dependants; in which is expressed his own dignity and gravity united with urbanity, and at the same time their unviolated attachment to him. Thus too, by the same circumstance is depicted both the ardour and alacrity of the war-horse, and his eagerness for the battle: "For eagerness and fury he devoureth the very ground, He believeth it not when he heareth the trumpet. When the trumpet soundeth, he saith, ahah! Yea he scenteth the battle from afar, The thunder of the chieftains and their shouts  651 ." This passage, which has indeed always attracted general admiration, will also serve to exemplify the excellence of the descriptive parts of this poem: and from the same circumstance we may fairly conjecture, that the pictures, which are exhibited in other parts of the work, would appear no less striking resemblances of the realities, were we equally well acquainted with the originals. To judge rightly of a description, we ought to have as clear and distinct ideas of the thing itself as the author. The idea of thunder is familiar to all mankind; observe, therefore, how it is depicted by Elihu: "At this my heart trembleth, And is ready to bound from its place. Hearken attentively, and tremble at his voice; Even at the sound that goeth out of his mouth. Its flash is beneath the whole heavens, And its blaze to the ends of the earth. After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty: He deceiveth them not when his voice is heard 652 . It would be superfluous to insist any longer on a minute detail, since the most splendid examples of every beauty and elegance of sentiment, of imagery, and of diction, meet the eye of the attentive reader in every part of the Poem. Let it suffice to say, that the dignity of the style is answerable to that of the subject; its force and energy to the greatness of those passions which it describes: and as this production excels all the other remains of the Hebrew Poetry in economy and arrangement, so it yields to none in sublimity of style, and in every grace and excellence of composition. Among the principal of these may be accounted the accurate and perfectly poetical conformation of the sentences, which is indeed generally most observable in the most ancient of the poetical compositions of the Hebrews. Here, however, as is natural and proper in a poem of so great length and sublimity, the writer's skill is displayed in the proper adjustment of the period, and in the accurate distribution of the members, rather than in the antithesis of words, or in any laboured adaptation of the parallelisms. in my investigation of the nature of the Hebrew Poetry, it is time that my present undertaking should draw towards a conclusion. If in the prosecution of my design, I have by my industry been able to accomplish any thing that may be deemed satisfactory, it is but common justice to attribute the greatest part of my success to you, Gentlemen, who have condescended to look with a propitious eye upon my endeavours, and to invigorate my application by your attention and partiality. When, indeed, I first meditated this system of instruction, I foresaw, as well from the native sublimity and obscurity of the subject, as from the extreme antiquity of the Hebrew writings, much subtile investigation, much difficult explication, much doubtful assertion, and dangerous error. I foresaw too, and daily experience confirmed my apprehensions, that in this maze of science, the vestiges and the documents of the learned would be frequently found but imperfect guides. That my courage did not utterly forsake me in the course of my undertaking, is to be attributed entirely to the favour and encouragement which I received from you. I had the satisfaction to find my plan meet with the approbation of some of the greatest and most eminent characters in the learned world, as being neither inconsistent with the design of this institution, the dignity of this University, nor the profit and utility of the students. I had often the singular pleasure of seeing, among my auditors, many persons, to whom it would better become me to apply for instruction in this and in every other branch of literature; and the young men, for whose benefit this institution was established, I have found ever diligent and constant in their attendance: all which testimonies of your favour, unless I accounted as obligations, I should think either too arrogantly of myself, or too disrespectfully of you. To all of you, therefore, I feel, and shall for ever feel myself obliged: the remembrance of your kindness will, in every vicissitude of my condition, be pleasing to me; nor is there any danger of my suffering that to escape my memory, which I must ever esteem the great ornament of my life. But to return to a point which is of more importance, and which has indeed been the principal object of all my endeavours. I should now think myself called upon, in the last place, to exhort this assembly of accomplished youths to an assiduous application to these studies; but that I confess I think you rather demand commendation than advice. For the Hebrew language, which was for a series of years in a manner obsolete and neglected, has been lately cultivated by you with such attention and application, and has obtained so respectable a place among the other branches of erudition, that it seems, through your means, to have recovered, after a tedious exile, all its former dignity and importance. Proceed, therefore, in the same career with the same ardour and success, and consider it as a work worthy of your utmost exertions to illustrate and cultivate this department of literature. You will find it no less elegant and agreeable, than useful and instructive; abounding in information no less curious for its extent and variety, than for its great importance and venerable sanctity; deserving the attention of every liberal mind; essential to all who would be proficients in theology: a branch of literature, in a word, which will confer credit upon yourselves, will be an honour to the university, and an advantage to the church. I congratulate you, Gentlemen, on having an Instructor  653 , who, from his authority, example, assiduity, and information, will be found in no respect wanting to your profit and accommodation: a Gentleman no less eminent for his abilities and profound erudition, than for the candour, urbanity, and gentleness of his manners. He will unfold to you the inexhaustible treasures of Oriental literature, he will open to your view an unbounded field of science and of fame. It is sufficient for me to have discovered to you a few of the more delightful retreats of this paradice: and could I flatter myself that my endeavours have been so fortunate as to allure or excite any to these studies, or even to stimulate and keep alive your attention to this department of literature, I should think that I had received the most honourable, the most grateful reward of my labours. IT is well known, that an hypothesis was invented by the late Bishop Hare concerning the Hebrew metres; and the arguments, which he had advanced in its favour, appeared so conclusive to some persons of great erudition, as to persuade them, that the learned prelate had fortunately revived the knowledge of the true Hebrew versification, after an oblivion of more than two thousand years; and that he had established his opinion by such irresistible proofs, as to place it beyond the utmost efforts of controversy. Whoever, indeed, encounters it in such a manner, as only to call in question some particular part, to intimate only an occasional scruple, or to attack but one or two of his arguments, will, doubtless, "attempt in vain  654 to root out of their minds an opinion which has been so deeply implanted and established by the authority of so great a man: much less will any person obtain credit who shall affirm, that he has discovered what was not discovered by the learned Prelate, unless by the strongest arguments he not only overthrows the hypothesis which he rejects, but confirms his own. Avoiding therefore every subterfuge, I shall come immediately to the point, and demonstrate by the clearest and most decisive instances, which is the only method of extorting assent from the incredulous, that I have actually discovered the nature and principles of this poetry," and those directly contrary to the system which he has adopted. I shall, on this occasion, make use of the same example that Bishop Hare himself has chosen; which, when properly considered, will, I think, sufficiently explain and prove my opinion; and at the same time effectually overturn his hypothesis. 655 1\. od eh javoh becol lebab, 2\. befod jesarim veYedah. 3\. gedolim maYase javoh,  656 4\. derusim lecol chepzehem. 5\. hod vehadar poYalo,  657 6\. vezidkatho Yomedeth laYad. 7\. zecer Yasah leniphlothav;  658 8\. chanun verachum javoh. 9\. tereph nathan lireav,  659 10\. jizcor leYolam beritho. 11\. coach maYasav higid leYamo,  660 12\. latheth lahem nachalath goim. 13\. maYase jadav emeth umispat;  661 14\. neemanim col pikduav: 15\. semucim laYad leYolam,  662 16\.

From this alphabetic Psalm, which is divided into its proper verses according to the initial letters, and restored to its proper numbers without any violation of the text, without even any change of the Masoretic vowels (except that with Bishop Hare, I read javoh ) the canons of the Hebrew metre are to be collected and established. I.  666 In the first place then, in the Hebrew Poetry the feet are not all dissyllables: for in verse 3, 11, 16.---l im maYa---coach  667 ---im be---are Dactyls; in verse 13, 14, maYafe, neema\---are Anapaests: contrary to the first canon of Bishop Hare. II. Attention must always be paid to the quantity of the syllables, for the same word, as often as it occurs, is always of the same quantity; for instance, javoh, lecol, are constantly Iambics, laYad is always a Trochaic, maYase an Anapaest; leYolam is uniformly an Amphimaser: beritho, Yomedeth, is an Amphibrachis: contrary to the second canon of Bishop Hare. III. The verses are either Trochaic, which admit a Dactyl; or Iambic, which admit an Anapaest; but it by no means follows, that a verse is either the one or the other, from its consisting of an even or odd number of syllables. Those indeed which consist of an even number of syllables, are, for the most part, Iambic, as verse 1, 2, 7, 13, 14, 15, 20; but they are also sometimes Trochaic, as verse 3, 4, 10, 18, 21; and those which consist of an odd number of syllables are mostly Trochaic, as verse 5, 8, 9, 11, 16, 19; they are however sometimes Iambic, as verse 6, 12, 17, 22: contrary to the third and fourth canon. IV. The verses of the same period are of different kinds, period iii, iv, vi, viii, ix, x, xi. a few only excepted, as period i, ii, v, vii: and those which are of the same kind seldom agree in the number of syllables and feet: for instance, in period ii, and v. the first verse is a Trochaic Dimeter Catalectic, the second a Trochaic Dimeter Acatalectic; in period vii. the first is an Iambic Dimeter Hypercatalectic, the second an Iambic Dimeter Catalectic: the only instance of verses agreeing in kind, agreeing also in syllables and feet is in period i. and those are Iambics: and this is contrary to the sixth, seventh, and eighth canons. V. All the periods consist of only two verses; for properly koph and resh constitute the penultimate, and shin and tau the ultimate period; as also appeared to the learned Cappell : this is contrary to the fifth canon. VI. Each verse has one particular sense: contrary to the ninth canon. "That what I have advanced as true and indisputable, is most true, appears from the examples which I have adduced; and whoever reads attentively the book of Psalms, will find similar instances in almost every page  668 ." Since this is the case, since I have deduced happily the abstruse principles of the Hebrew metre from this Psalm, or rather explained clearly such as readily presented themselves, and have reduced them to an art easy, perfect, and consistent; depending upon principles certain and self-evident: but not taking those liberties in which Bishop Hare has prolixly indulged himself, so as to make the same word sometimes Trochaic, sometimes Iambic, sometimes a Dissyllable, and sometimes a Trisyllable; I may reasonably indulge myself in the hope, that the candid reader will prefer my hypothesis to that of Bishop Hare. This at least I trust I may expect, that he will treat them upon equal terms, and allow to each the same authority, that is --- NONE AT ALL. In the same manner every hypothesis, which pretends to define the laws of Hebrew metre, and to prescribe the numbers, the feet, the scanning of the lines, may, I think, be easily overset: for to that hypothesis another directly contrary, yet confirmed by arguments equally forcible, may, I am persuaded, be successfully opposed. With regard to the opinion of those who suppose the whole art of Hebrew metre to consist in a similarity of termination to each verse; though it has acquired some popularity and authority in the learned world, I think it by far the most ill-founded of all; and I think its absurdity so obvious, that with the utmost ease it may be detected. Since the endings of the verses are defined in some of the alphabetical Poems, and since it is manifest, that in these the verses do not end alike, that no art or attention has been bestowed upon that point, it follows of course that the art of Hebrew versification does not consist in making verses with similar endings.
