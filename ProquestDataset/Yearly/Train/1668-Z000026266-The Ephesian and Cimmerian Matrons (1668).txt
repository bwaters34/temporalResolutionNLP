 Noble Sir , little power I have to obey, even the strongest inclinations of my own Genius, when your commands have once told me, I must apply my self to complaisance with Yours; I have strugled hard to master my natural aversion to Writing, and for a day or two taken up my long discontinued Pen; choosing for my Argument, a short Story , such, Whose Truth might supply the barenness of my Invention , and whose pleasantness renders both the harshness of my style , and the morosity of my humour , the less offensive. It concerns a beautiful and good natured Creature , whose Adventures have been thought so memorable, that time it self hath not been able to sink them in that Abyss of oblivion, in which, many potent Monarchs have been swallowed up; nor have many great Scholars, and eminent Wits, thought it beneath the dignity of their Pens, to transmit the memory of them to posterity. I cannot tell you the Womans name; my Authors having been in that point unanimously silent; but you may call her, if you please, the Wandring Greek : for, she hath visited more Countries , than Queen Christina , (who, though now naturalized a Roman , doth yet retain much of the Goth and Vandal ) and is perfect in more Languages . After I had seen her in the Greek, Roman, German and French habits, and observed such a natural comeliness, as made her appear lovely and pleasant in each dress, that ingenious Foreigners had clad her in; and been assured by some of them, that even Princes had sometimes made her a Favourite: I had a humour also to put her into our English garb, that you might be acquainted with her, and judge, whether that be not as becomming and graceful as any of the rest. If I have set her forth in an equipage somewhat too grave and solemn , according to the fashion of my own phansie, which is most delighted with sad colours, and plain useful garments; so that she may now seem the Mistress rather of a Philosopher than of a Courtier: it was, because I would not have her appear altogether a stranger, and ignorant of the mode of the time, wherein the greatest levity and licenciousness , is commonly wrapt up in the most austere looks , and sober formality of dress; and Lasciviousness generally usurps the long veil of Modesty . I have not furnished her with Jewels , and made her shine with gaudy Ornaments, both because I had none of my own, and because I think them fit only for such, who wanting native Beauty enough to fill the beholders sight, avert him from discerning their defects, by catching his eyes with the lustre of Pearl, Diamonds and Rubies; whereas this our Matron is so largely beholding to the bounty of Nature , that she scorns the mean charity of Art; and you may as soon perswade her to turn Adamite , as to make use of precious Stones . Yet I'le promise you, her Linnen is fine , clean, and white, though plain and unstarched. And because she is a Mourner, I have accoutred her in a sable Veil: which she puls down, as often as she hath occasion to hide her blushes; and turns up again, when she is pleased to be more free, and discover the charms of her smiles. Nor can I tell you precisely her Age , though I guess it to be near upon that of the Roman Empire , which is, by some hundreds of years, elder than the Wandring Jew . But, let not that discourage you; for she is yet youthful, sprightly, and gamesome, and hath not a wrinckle in her face; insomuch, that a Gentleman, who surprized me, with her in my company, would not be perswaded but she was my daughter. Besides, what is immortal (as she seems to be) must, you know, be ever young and flourishing. As for her Religion, I confess also, I can give you no certain account of it, because (contrary to the custom of most of her sex) she is very reserved in that particular. Yet, if I may have the liberty of conjecturing from some Actions of hers, I should take her to be of old Epicurius's Faith, following the simple dictates of mother-Nature, and living by the plain rule of her own Inclinations; as holding it a contradiction, to be born under one Law, and to another bound : or else a Sister of the family of Love, which scruples at no freedom with a sanctified Brother, and justifies her familiarity with fervency of Zeal, and suggestions of the spirit . Do not you therefore conceive her to be a Vestal, or one that resolves to pervert the purpose of Nature, and hath abjured the end of her Creation; albeit you see her in a Vault, in a lamenting posture, and with a small Taper burning by her: For really, she is a Cyprian Nun, consecrated to the Goddess of Pleasure, inflamed with zeal of Priapus : She is furnished with an Altar, with Incense, and with Fire too, and wants only a Priest to come and animate her Sacrifice. For her Humour , you will find her in all things a perfect Woman, a little subject to changes, seldom out of extreams; weeping and smiling in a breath, leaping at once out of a Charnel-house into a Nuptial-bed; soon quitting a violent grief for a good Husband lately deceased, for to solace in the embraces of a new Love; this moment, in the bottom of despair, and the next in the height of fruition; now endeavouring to destroy her self, and anon, doing her devoir to procreate another, and give Being to posterity; too wise to refuse a good proffer, or neglect a fair opportunity; highly sweet and obliging upon occasion, even to a stranger, and at first enterview, full of frankness and endearments, where she affects; forward to excuse and palliate the errors of her friend, and admirably witty, in projecting a way to avert suddain danger threatning him. And what would you more from a Woman? Notwithstanding all these excellent qualities, let me not only desire, but also conjure you, to imprison her in your private Cabinet, so that she may be seen by no eyes but your own. Not that you need be jealous of either her chastity or reputation; for, the one is proof against the corruptions even of Peter Arentine himself, if he were alive and conversant with her; and she hath cunning enough of her own to preserve the other: but, for fear she meet with affronts from the Ladies, who will never be reconciled to a Woman that is so weak, as to betray the frailties, and lay open the secrets of her own Sex. Besides that, she is a professed Enemy to their own darling, Platonick-Love; and ingeniously confesseth, she knows no flames, but such as arise from the difference of Sex, and are kindled in the blood, and other luxuriant humours of the body: and that her Amours always tend to the propagation of somewhat more Material, than the simple Ideas of vertue, of which our Philosophical Ladies so much talk. Which heretical doctrine, if they once hear her preach, 'tis not all the Armies in the world shall protect her from suffring the fate of Orpheus; nor shall you, Sir, with all your good language, and other ingratiating Arts, be able to vindicate her cause, or secure your self from the hateful brand of a Woman-hater . As therefore you value this Ephesian's free conversation, or the favour of Ladies, be sure you keep her to your self; but, if you will needs shew your self to be of the number of those open-breasted men, who think no pleasure compleat, until they have boasted of it; yet, at least, be so just to the sacred Laws of friendship, as never to reveal who brought her into England, only for your private recreation; and then leave her adversaries to consult their grand Oracle Lilly, how to find out, Most honoured Sir, Your most Humble Servant. the admiring Youths of that populous and wealthy City, and sought in marriage by many, whose ample Fortunes encouraged them to hope for success, answerable to their desires, (which could not be but just and commendable, since fixed upon an Object, whom an incomparable Beauty, an ingenious Soul, vertuous Education, and that usual attendant of all these, an honourable Fame, had conspired to make an extraordinary Person) This Virgin , I say, was at length espoused to a young Gentleman , in whom nothing was wanting that could be required, to make him accomplisht and amiable, especially in her eye, who loved him with equal ardours; and thought of no felicity, but in his mutual affections and society. So that all men (his envious Rivals only excepted) expected the perfection of mortal happiness to arise from so rare a union. But, observe unconstancy of human felicity ; This pair of Turtles had not long enjoyed the pleasures of each others conversation, when Fate (seldom long propitious to Lovers) steps in, and divides them, by the eternal divorce of death; translating the Husband into a state of more durable delights, and leaving the poor widdowed Lady in the arms of a distracting grief, too excessive to fall under the description of the most tragical Pen; and indeed so violent, as would soon have sufficed to the destruction of so delicate and tender a Nature, as hers was, had not her resolution to see her dearest All (so she called him) laid into his Tomb, with such Funeral Pomp, and solemn Obsequies, as were agreeable both to his quality, and her sorrow; somewhat conduced to her preservation. Which yet was but an accidental preservative, and such, whose effect she could not directly aim at; all the faculties of her wounded soul being wholly taken up with the image of her loss; and excluding all light of comfort, but those weak and faint glimpses that arose in her darksome imagination, from her hopes to make haste and overtake him, who was gone before. But alas! I speak much to the diminution of her fidelity, when I call them Hopes ; they were advanced to full Resolutions , and those made unalterable, by the sanction of a solemn vow , to outdo the malice of death; and by a speedy re-union of her spirit with his, in the Elyzium , to regain that content in the other World, which the cruelty of the gods had ravisht from her in this. And according to this too rigorous Vow, she refuseth all nourishment, admitting nothing into her mouth but the cold air, and tears uncessantly distilling from her once bright and sparkling, but now dim and blubber'd eyes; and this, notwithstanding the importunities of her Parents and Friends on one side, and the necessities of Nature on the other, urging her to commiserate and relieve her self. In this sad condition she continued three whole days and nights, abhorring all objects but what her grief presented, and keeping her confused remembrance perpetually upon the Rack, to afford her the images of her past felicities, that might aggravate the resentments of her present misery: Which yet being (as she thought) insufficient to exalt her sorrows to the height of destroying her, she privately conveys her self into the Vault, where the remains of her Husband had been newly laid, and there sits down upon the damp earth, with her eyes fixt upon his Coffin, lest her thoughts might chance to wander from their proper object.  It was great wonder that Nature Might suffer any creature. To have such sorowe, and she not ded; Full piteous pale, and nothing red. She said a lay, a maner songe; Without note, withouten song; And was this, for full well I can Reherse it, right thus it began. I have of sorrow so great wone, That joy get I never none; Nowe that I se my Husband bright, Whiche I have loved with all my might, Is fro me deed, and is agone. And thus in sorowe left me alone, Alas Dethe, what yeleth the, That thou noldest have taken me? This (you'l say) was a rare demonstration of a Woman's constancy , and ought not to be past over without admiration, and an acknowledgement, that this vertuous Matron well deserved to wear a Garland, in that Troop of Heroical Wives , who scorning to survive their better part, their Husbands, are honoured by posterity, as examples of singular faith, and conjugal amity. And I shall also ingenuously confess, that her love must needs be great, which transported her to so generous a pitch of sorrow, and bravery of resolution, I presume moreover, that your pity is already risen to that height, that are concerned in her danger; and that you would most gladly run into the Vault, to save her from a death so cruel, so iminent. But alas, she is resolved upon it, and your humanity would but degenerate into a prolongation of her afflictions. For, in life she knew no content, but in the society of her Love, whose mortal part was now in the cold fetters of an everlasting sleep; and therefore remains holy uncapable of any the least consolation, unless from this, that she may be hastned in her journey, to meet and embrace his beloved Ghost. If therefore your commiseration will do any thing towards her comfort and repose, pray exercise it in killing her, and let the kindness of your sword suddainly prevent the lingring tortures of her famine and laments. But I know you are too good-natured to have her die; and but to suppose her after all this, capable of being reconciled to life, were the only way to make her and her whole Sex hate you. What then is to be done in order to her Rescue? Why, have but patience a little, and you shall see how miraculously Fortune hath contrived to gratifie you and other her friends, in her preservation. It hapned, that on the very same day her Husbands funeral rites were solemnized, and his Corps set into the Vault amongst his Ancestors, there was a notorious malefactor executed, and his body left upon the Gibbet; the better to strike terror into others, and by the example of his infamous punishment, to raise in the hearts of all the spectators, a due abomination of the like crimes. And lest any of the Villain's relations or confederates, should take down the mangled Carcass, and convey it away to burial privily in the night; Proclamation was made to the contrary, at command of the Magistrate; and a guard of Soldiers consigned to watch it, with the penalty of no less than death to such of them, as should through carelesness, drousieness, or absence, be failing in that their duty. Now night being come, the Soldiers thinking one was enough to attend that easie charge, fall to casting lots among themselves, who should undertake it; and the lot falling upon one, of whose vigilancy the rest had no reason to doubt, they all withdrew themselves into a Tavern neer at hand, the better to secure themselves from the cold, and rawness of the night, leaving that one to perform the Duty. They were no sooner gone, when this Sentinel also, feeling himself pinched by the cold, and confident none would hazard so dear a thing as life, in stealing away the torn carcass of a Rogue, bethinks himself of shelter and rest: and remembring there was a certain spacious arched Vault (the very same our Mourner had obscured her self in) under-neath the Temple, over against which the Gibbet was erected; he retires into it, conducted thither, doubtless, by the invisible hand of his good Angel. Being entred into the mouth of the Vault, his eyes were instantly saluted with the beams of a small and weak light, that shone from the farthest end of it; at sight whereof he was surprized with a suddain fit of horrour, which lessening by degrees, (as all terrible objects are greatest, at first glance of the eye upon them) his curiosity soon got the upper hand of his fear, and carrieth him nearer and nearer, till at length by the help of that glimmering Taper, which yet had not wholly overcome the gloomy darkness of that dismal place, he could perceive something resembling a Woman , in a mournful dress, but with a countenance far more mournful, sitting on the ground, with arms enfolded in the posture of extream sorrow, and her head carelesly drooping, as if it were desirous and ready to fall upon the Coffin placed at her feet. Having a while stood wondring at this strange and doleful spectacle, and considering with himself, that it could not be a meer Apparition; all those stories of Ghosts, Spectres, and Devils in humane shape, being but the politick Fictions of Rulers and Priests, to keep the vulgar honest in the dark, and by fear to deter such from vice, who would not pursue vertue meerly for love of it: he banisheth all apprehensions of terrour, and boldly advanceth to the Taper. The impediment of distance, which before permitted him but an obscure and imperfect sight of what his wonder had directed him unto, now removed; the soldier takes a full view of the distressed Lady, and soon finds his Sense had not been deluded by a phantasm, and that she was a real woman, as at first glance he had apprehended her to be. Nor could the Ecclipse of her sorrow and dejection hinder, but he might easily discern a certain charming lustre irradiating the rare features of her face, together with an awful and majestick sweetness, such as is wont to strike respect and secret adoration into the hearts of the beholders; and being the separable adjunct of singular beauty, cannot be concealed by the most altering disguise of the extreamest passion. Here the Divinity of her form surprizing his Soul, on one side; and the prodigious equipage he saw her in distracting it, on the other: the man was overwhelmed with amazement, and wanted not much of becoming a statue. But, the light of his reason by little and little breaking through those clouds, and dispersing them, he resumes his courage and resolves to speak to her. Which as he was about to do, it chanced, that lifting up her wearied head, and opening the curtains of her eyes, (which till then had remained let down) to give them some ease by change of posture, she percived a Man or Ghost (for as yet she could not distinguish) standing before her.  For her sorowe, and holy thought Made her that, she herde him nought. For she had welnye lost her mind, Though Pan, that men clepeth god of kind, Were for her sorowes never so wrothe. But at the last, to sain right sothe, She was ware of him, how he stood, Before her, and did of his hood, And had ygret her, as best he coude, Debonairely, and nothing loude. As Reverend Chaucer in his Dream: She startled a little at the unexpected sight, but being wholly intent upon her sorrow, and strongly possessed with a conceit, that the worst of evils that her nature was capable of, had already befallen her; that if he were a Ghost , he could have no other errand to her, but to invite and hasten her to the place, whither her dearest Mate was gone before; and if a Man , he could not be so void of humanity, as to disturb the quiet of her innocent grief. These reflections (I say) quickly recomposed her, so that she was able to demand an account of him of his being there. Which she did in this manner. "Friend, said she, (and certainly, whatsoe're you are, you can be no other to me, who can have no enemy but life) would you any thing with me? If so, pray speak it freely; I am not afraid to hear the worst tidings you can bring. Fate hath shot the most bloody and mortal of all its Arrows into me already, and all that are to follow will be but favours. My misery, though great, hath yet this comfort annexed to it, that it cannot possibly be greater. Lo, here, (pointing to the Coffin) here lies my Heart, dead and cold as marble; and if I seem to be alive, it is only because the soul of sorrow annimates me a while, till I have prepared my self to descend a fitting Shade, to attend his, who by this time expects me. But if only Chance hath brought you hither, why do you not be gone? What wrong have I ever done you, that should make you thus envy me the peace of this solitary room, a place sacred, and pecular only to the dead? And (you know) that for any, but Mourners, to intrude into their Dormitories, is a prophanation not easily expiated. Pray therefore, before you become further guilty, depart, and leave me to accomplish that sacrifice, my Fidelity and Vow oblige me to offer in this place." To this (delivered with something of anger, and as much vehemence, as the weakness of her half-starved body would permit) the Souldier modestly returns: "That no design at least, concerning her, but meer adventure, had led him into that place, where he conceived nothing but horrour and unwholesome damps had resided; That the sight of a woman there, at that dead time of the night, alone, and in that strange posture too, was sufficient to excuse his admiration, and that to excuse his curiosity, for the satisfaction of which he had approach'd her. That if therein he had, contrary to his intent, been an occasion of disturbance to her, in the performance of those dismal Rites, her afflicted imagination had caused her to please her self withal, (what they were, he knew not) he was ready to aske her pardon for that his misfortune. And as for any offense to the Manes of those, whose bodies were there deposited, he conceived himself wholly innocent, as comming thither with no such black purpose, as to dislodge their Reliques, or violate their Sepulchres. Lastly, that if his presence were ungrateful to her, (to whom he heartily wished a serenity of mind, equal to the sweetness of her person) he was ready to depart, notwithstanding the tenderness of his disposition made him have some sympathy in her afflictions, and urged him to offer her that succour, which he was able to afford. Which yet, he confessed, could not be great, considering the vast disparity betwixt the meanness of his condition, and rudeness of education, on his part; and the wise counsel, and consolatory arguments he found requisite, on hers. However, if his diligence, yea, if his life, might be any way serviceable to her, she should freely command him. And having said thus, he remained silent."  Lo how goodly spake this Knight, As if it had be another wight, And made it neither tough ne queint. Here the Lady somewhat touched with the great humanity and gentleness of the Man, whom by his Arms she perceived to be a Soldier, and so had admitted some apprehensions of a return more rough and agreeable to the manners of those of his profession and ranck, was offering to rise up, and dismiss him with thanks due to his civility; when her macerated and languishing body, and her exhausted spirits failing to be obedient to her soul, she sunk down in a swoon, and lay speechless and enervated, cross her Husbands Coffin. Which the honest Fellow perceiving, and fearing she had expired her very soul, in that last great sigh that brake from her breast, at the instant of her fall; he was not a little astonished: but yet he had so much reason left, as hastned him to endeavour her recovery, by taking her up in his arms, gently reclining her head, and pouring a little Wine into her mouth, from a Bottle he had brought with him, wherewith to fortifie himself against the cold and moystness of the weather. This so repaired her defect of spirits, that her heart and arteries renewing their intermitted pulses, she soon came to her self again; but so imperfectly, that though her vitall Organs seemed to perform their offices aright, yet those of voluntary motion wholly failed in theirs. Which the Souldier observing, and concluding with himself; that the virtue of that cordial, which infused into her in a small quantity, had so happily begun his cure, if administred in a greater dose, would not fail to finish it; he set the bottle a second time to her mouth and forced her to take in a large draught. The Wine, by reason of its sublety, soon dispersing through her whole body, and recruiting her spirits, (consumed by immoderate grief, and long abstinence) wrought so powerfully upon her, that she now feels her self not only revived, but in some measure also comforted within her, (O! who can sufficiently admire the excellency of this divine Liquor?) and her faculty of moving her self restored; so that, erecting her self upon her legs, she turned to her Physitian, and disposing her eyes and countenance into such an aspect of gentleness and sweetness, as intimated to him, she had no ill resentments of the good offices his charity had done her; without other expression of thankfulness, she sat down to repose her self upon the Coffin, the unfrequented place affording no other seat. The Man encouraged by the happy success of his assistance, and discreetly taking the opportunity of that calm, which he discerned the Wine had brought upon both her mind  & spirits, began with gentle reasons (for Rhetorical arguments he had none) to make her sensible of the extream need she was in of some speedy corporal refection : And not being so ceremonious, as to stay and expect her answer, he instantly opens his Knapsack, and produceth such cold and homely Viands, as he, in cleanly manner had laid therein, for his own provision: These he tenders to her, in the most humble and decent posture, the incommodities of the time and place would admit of intreating her, in commiseration of her self, to second the good effect of the Wine, with a bit or two of solid meat; and to dispense with the coorseness both of his diet and service, her safety depending chiefly upon a speedy refreshment, and at the present he was destitute of better accommodation. Now, whether we ought to ascribe it to the sole hand of Fate , which laughs at the vanity of mens resolutions, and by turning our hearts like rivers of water, delights to convince us, How little that power is, we arrogant Mortals think we have over our selves . Or, to the benigne and sweetning efficacy of the Wine , which (doubtless) is the most soveraign and present Antidote in Nature against excess of sorrow: Or, to the force of the Souldiers Perswasions , which, though not delivered with the advantage of smooth and courtly language, appear to have been strong and prevalent: Or, to the secret strokes of Love , (as Philosophers call them) which being observed alwaies to wound deepest upon the sodain, and as often in the depth of adversity, as in the height of ease and prosperity, might (for ought we know) be, by the wanton god , inflicted upon the Ladie's heart, and so wonderfully recompose all the confusions and disorders of her soul, as at that very instant to tune all her faculties once more to the key of the most sweet and harmonious of all our affections. I say, to which of all these probable causes, (or to the conspiracie of them all together) the Miracle is to be imputed, I confess, I cannot determine; and therefore willingly resigne that nice enquiry to those Sages, who pretend to understand the secrets of Women's hearts. But, so it fell out, that our Matron being now able to command a Truce to her sorrow, cheerfully addressed her self to the victuals set before her, and did eat moderately thereof: in the quiet and pleasantness of her looks, sweetly betraying that inward agreableness and delight Nature became sensible of, in that supply which had been too long denyed her. This our Man of War , (who, it seems by the story, was no fool) perceiving, and understanding withall, that some seasonable relief from reason and wise counsel was as requisite, to the re-composure of her disordered mind, as his meat and drink had been, to the instauration of her infeebled body; he bethought himself what to say, that might conduce to the mitigation of her violent sorrow. And, though he were no Philosopher, nor Orator, his head not being altogether so well furnished with arguments of consolation, as his Scrip and Bottle had been with Provision; yet he had so competent a share of the light of Nature, (which, as many wise men hold, shineth alwaies clearest in the darkness of necessity, and sudden occasions) as directed him bluntly to tell her, That albeit moderate humiliation of the body, and contristation of spirit, upon the decease of dear friends and relations, were not to be disallowed, as being the effects of that love and respect we bore them in our lives and pregnant testimonies of natural affection, without which, Man degenerateth into the savageness of beasts: yet an intemperate sorrow, and afflicting our selves beyond measure, was not only unreasonable, but also unnatural; unreasonable, in that it doth as little avail to the good or benefit of the dead, as to the recalling them to life again; they being in a state, which admits of no commerce with, or concernment for the survivors. Unnatural, in that it impaireth the health of the body, and beclouds the brightness of the understanding, both which are the chiefest treasures of our lives, and every man is bound by the Law of Nature, to endeavour their preservation, as much as in him lies. He added, That if she had suffered her passion to transport her to any such extravagance, as an intent to destroy her self, (as she had seemed to intimate, both by her expressions and deportment in that place, which of it self appeared a fit Scene whereon to act such a Tragedy) she ought with the soonest to retract it. For the greatest crime man could commit, was Murder; and of all Murders, the most detestable was self-Homicide , which the Creator did so abominate, as that he Had engraven upon our very Nature, the Law of Self-preservation , as if on purpose to prevent it. And should Heaven be so mercifull, as to forgive it, (which was dangerous to presume) yet certainly the Ghost of her Husband would not; since, if he loved her while alive, he could not be pleased with any violence she should offer to her self, but would rather abhor the society of so great a Criminal, among the Shades; at least, if Souls departed hence have any sense or cognizance of the actions of Mortals upon Earth. The pious Matron hearing this, could not refrain from interrupting her counsellor, but replied; That she must acknowledge the truth and weight of his discourses; but yet, (and then she sighed) she had lost such a Jewel of a Husband, as never woman lost. And therefore, if her grief were violent and invincible, she deserved rather pity and excuse, than reprehension and condemnation, both from gods and men. And more she would have said, but that a fresh flood of tears running down her cheeks, robbed her lips of the freedom of their motion. The Souldier seeing this, and fearing a relapse, had immediate recourse to the Antidote of the Bottle , of whose cordial juice he had so admirable experience: and without more ado, he holds up her head with one hand, while with the other he drencheth her with a round dose of the remaning liquor: And she had no sooner felt the warmth and vigour of it in her stomach, but the fountains of her tears were instantly sealed up, her forehead smoothed, and all her face reduced to its native sweetness: Nay more, this last draught wrought so divinely, that her mind also seemed perfectly restored to its antient mildness and tranquility, and she became the most affable, compleasant, and chearfull creature in the world, indeed as if a new Soul had been infused into her. This great change considered, who can but fall into a rapture, in thinking of the virtue of Wine, or forbear to repeat father Sancho's prayer, that Providence would never suffer him to want good store of that celestial Nectar . But, our argument is yet sad, and it imports us to be more serious. For, Here some witty Disciple of Epicurus (arresting us in the middle of our Narration) may take advantage to disparage the excellency and immortallity of that noble essence, the reasonable Soul of man; and from the example of the soveraign operation of the Wine upon this deplorable Lady, thus argue against it. If our inclinations and wills be so neerly dependent upon the humours and temperament of our bodies, as to be, in a manner, the pure and natural consequents or results from them; and that our humours and temperament be so easily and soon variable, according to the various qualities of meats and drinks received into our stomachs; both which seem verified in the instance of this Ephesian Woman, who by the generous quality of the Wine, and nutritive juice of the Meat, was, as it were, in a moment altered in her whole frame; of a highly discontented and desperate wretch, becomming a quiet, tractable, and good humour'd creature, quitting her morosity and contumacy in a murderous resolution, for frank affability, yieldingness, and alacrity; Why should not men believe, with his Master Epicurus , that the Soul is nothing else but a certain composition or contexture of subtle Atoms , in such manner figured and disposed, and natively endowed with such activity, as to animate the body, and actuate all the members and organs of it; or, with Galen , that the Soul is but the Harmony of Elements , concurring in the composition of the body, at first, and in the same tenour continued afterward during life, by supplies of the most subtle and refined parts of our nourishment? Especially, if they reflect upon the admirable effects of Wine, which hath the power to alter, not only the temperament of the body, but even that of the mind also; subduing the most refractory and unbridled of all our passions, and raising up others as violent in their room; in a word, so forcibly turning the needle of our affections and inclinations from one extreme to another, and hurring them from point to point round the whole Compass, as if it were it self a soul; at least, as it if had the soveraignty over the best of souls. Now if any such weak and prevaricating Epicurean shall cast this stumbling- block in our way; though we are loth to leave the Lady, now she is in so good a humour, yet the honour we owe to that divine substance , which he endeavours thus vilely to abase, obligeth us to digress a while, and vouchsafe him a short refutation. Let him know therefore, that every individual man hath two distinct Souls, the one Rational , or Intellectual , and Incorruptible , as being of divine Original, the breath of the Creator : The other only Sensitive , produced from the wombs of Elements ; common also to brute Animals, and therefore capable of dissolution. This latter Soul, (or, more properly, Spirit ) is the common Vinculum , Cement, or Tye, betwixt the celestial and incorporeal nature, of the reasonable Soul, and the terrestriall and corporeal nature of the Body: It is also the immediate organ or instrument, by which the nobler Soul informeth and acteth in the organs of the Body. Now, though we deny not, but the rational Soul, in respect of this her alliance with the Body, is in some degree subject to the Laws of Matter; and consequently, that the humours and temperament of the Body, have some influence or power to alter and work upon the mind, especially in weak-minded persons, who make no use of the arms of their reason, to encounter and subdue the insurrections and assaults of sensual appetites: Yet cannot we grant, that the impressions which the body makes upon the mind are such, as suffice to question either the Immortality, or derogate from the Soveraignty of the Soul over the Body. Not the Immortality of it; because, as an Infant in the Mothers womb, though sympathising with the Mother in all distempers, accidents, and symptoms that befall her, during the time of the Child's connexion to her body; is yet capable of being, in his due season, separated from her, and emancipated from his first state of compatibility into another of single subsistence; So the Rational Soul, though, during its connexion to the Body, subject to all affections and sufferings thereof, is yet nevertheless capable of being separated, in due season, from the Body, and surviving it to eternity, in a state of simplicity and incompatibility. Nor the Soveraignty of it over the Body; because, as a Monarch, notwithstanding he hath soveraign and absolute power over his Subjects, may sometimes be inclined by the sway of his servants; and yet without either subjection of his Person, or diminution of his power: So the Soul, though sometimes the affections of its subject, the Body, may incline or dispose it to assent and compliance: yet doth not that detract from either the excellency of its nature, or the absoluteness of its dominion over the Body. Besides, all those mutations of the affections, that arise from the variety of humours, and temperament of the Body, whether caused by Diet, Wine, or otherwise, are most unduely imputed to the Mind , or reasonable Soul it self, whose essence being simple, severeth it from all essential mutations; and indeed, extend no farther, than the Sensitive or the Brain, which is its principal organ: So that as it doth not derogate from the skill and ability of an excellent Musitian, that he cannot make good Musick upon an ill and untuneable Instrument; so likewise doth it not from the dignity of the Soul, that it cannot maintain the harmony of its Government, where the Brain is out of tune. And this we think sufficient to evince that the mutual league or alliance betwixt the Body and Mind is not so inseparable, but the Mind may both continue its Soveraignty, while that league continueth; and also continue its Being, after the same league is dissolved by death. But if the Adversary shall further urge us to informe him, What kind of substance we then conceive the Soul to be, we shall ingeniously confess, We do not understand it. Nor are we ashamed of that ignorance, forasmuch as the knowledge thereof is to be fetched, not from Reason or Philosophy, but from Revelation Divine . For, seeing the substance of the Soul was not deduced or extracted in its creation, from Matter, or Elements, as is manifest even from the transcendency of its functions and operations: certainly it follows, that the Laws of Matter or Elements, can in no wise comprehend its nature, or lead to the knowledge of its substance: but leaving Philosophy to its proper objects, we must expect it from the inspiration of the same Divinity, from whence the substance of it was originally derived. But inspirations Divine being very rare, our best way will be to suspend such subtle and Metaphysical Enquiries, till death; which will soon satisfie them, and all other difficulties of that nature. In the mean time, we beg excuse for thus long digressing into so grave and unsutable a Speculation, (which yet we could not well avoid) from our Story, and for holding you upon the rack of suspense, while your good nature makes you impatient till you are assured of the Ladie's perfect recovery. Returning to our Matron , I find my self surprised with more of wonder and amazement, than the Souldier was when he first beheld her. Methinks I perceive certain symptoms in her, which signifie not only a change of humour, but even a perfect metamorphosis of her person also; and so strangely is she altered, that did not the continuance of her mourning habit (and yet she hath dropt her Veil) together with the circumstances of time and place, assure me to the contrary; seriously I should not easily be perswaded that she is the same woman. She appears now to have so little of the sorrowful Widow in her, that if I might have the liberty Physiognomists take, of divining by outward signes, I should take her for the most pleased and happy Bride in the world. Her forehead seems not only smoothed, but dilated also to a more graceful largeness, and over-cast with a delicate sanguine Dye. Her eyes sparkling again with luster, yet little more then half open, with their amiable whites turned somewhat upward, unsteady, bedewed with a Ruby moisture,  & by stealth casting certain languishing glances (such as are observed only in persons dying, and Lovers in the extasie of delight) upon the Souldier. Her lips swelling with a delicious vermillion tincture, and gently trembling; yet still preserving the decorum and sweetness of her mouth. Her cheeks overflowing with pleasing blushes. Her head a little declining, as when Modesty hath a secret conflict with Desire. She is in a kind of gentle disquiet , such as accompanieth the impatience of the soul, when it is eager and restless in pursuit of the object, whereon it hath fixed its chief felicity. A temperate and Balmy sweat , extilling from the pores of her snow-white skin, helps to increase the kindly warmth of it, arising, doubtless, from a great agitation of her spirits within, and an effusion of them upon the outward parts, together with the vapours of her purest bloud. In a word, I discern in her a concourse of all those signes, which, as natural and inseparable characters, are proper to great joy and pleasure . What therefore should I think? To imagine that she, a woman of exemplary constancy, of chastity more cold and severe than the Goddess her self, who is said to be guardian of it; of sorrow (as your self can witness) almost unparallel'd and invincible; whose tears are yet scarcely dry, still sitting in a damp and horrid Charnel-house, at the dead time of the night, and upon the Coffin of her Dearest All : To imagine (I say) that this Woman should be so soon ingulphed in the delightful transports of a new Love , and that with a Fellow so much a Stranger, so much her Inferiour: This certainly is not only highly improbable, but unpardonably scandalous; and he, doubtless, would have no easie task to secure himself, from being torn in pieces by those of her Sex, who should dare to entertain a thought so much conducing to their disparagement. On the other side, the causes of suspicion are strong and manifest; for, if it be true, (as certainly it is) that Nature, not contented only to have given Man a tongue, wherewith to express his thoughts, hath also imprinted on his countenance the images of his most secret passions and intentions; and that upon this ground Philosophers have built that most excellent of all Arts, the Art of Knowing-Man , (the principal part of civil prudence) which teacheth how to dive into the most secret recesses, and hidden conceptions of the mind, only by observing the Figures and Characters that her inward motions draw upon the forehead, eyes and other parts of the face: I say, if this be true, we have good reason to suspect, that our Matron hath newly felt the power of Love's inevitable Dart, and she now burns as extreamly in the flames of amorous desires of the Soldier, as she was lately frozen in the ice of sorrow for her Husband. Her looks and gestures betray her, and all the Airs of high Content and Pleasure appearing in her face, will no longer permit me to doubt, but she hath lately tasted, and more then tasted, of that delight, which Lovers are sensible of in the act of Fruition, and which being it self a kind of Extasy , cannot be described, so as to be understood by any but such as feel it, nor those, but when they feel it. Nor need you longer remain in suspence: for, behold, she now throws her self into the Soldiers Arms, she embraceth him, she kisseth him, and with that violence, that greediness, as if she were unsatisfied with the bare touches of his lips, and longed to leave the impression of hers upon them. Nay, she takes no care to shut them, as if that negligent posture were more natural to the freedom of her kindness; or, as if she were in more readiness to receive that soul, she would have him breath into her. Nor doth any thing make her take off her mouth from his, but the impatience to have her eyes so long empty of the images of his form; and when she hath feasted that sense, with giving and receiving some fixt amorous looks, (for now they are no longer oblique glances) she instantly returns again to her banquet of kisses, as if the pleasures of her Eye , though high and ravishing among mutual Lovers, were yet inferior to those of the Touch ; or, as if the pleasures which each of these excellent senses doth affect the soul with, in such cases, were so great and violent, as that she is not capable of being intent upon both at once, but is forced to apply her self one while to one alone, another while to another, lest being distracted betwixt them, she might lose any whit of what her passion tells her, is requisite to consummate the fruition she aims at. In a word, (for we are fallen upon a Subject, whose nature is not to admit of much discourse) there is nothing of liberty, nothing of dalliance, nothing of caresses and indearment, which this sportful Lady doth not use, both to make her self grateful and charming to her new Gallant , and to enkindle fresh ardors in him. So that if what we see be not Venus her self, sporting with her beloved Mars ; yet, doubtless, it is one of her own daughters, in the heighth of solace with one of his sons. But, here Modesty commands us to turn our backs upon this pleasant couple; for, I perceive, he hath not yet exhausted all his Amunition, and that, grown more sensible of the Magique of her wanton incitements, he is arming himself for a second encounter, and stands ready to do that Act , which, though the most pleasant and entrancing of all others; cannot yet be, with good manners, named, much less lookt upon in the doing, by strangers. And you, as well as my self, know, how implacably angry the Cyprian goddess useth to be, with such immodest curiosities, as dare to prye into the Mysteries of her sacrifices, which she hath therefore commanded to be offered in the dark, and only by Couples. Let us, therefore, seasonably avert our yet innocent Eyes, and leave these her new Votaries quietly to finish those Cytherean Rites they are going about: especially since their Zeal is so fervent, as not to scruple at the nicety of making the Dead Husband's Coffin, the Altar, whereon to kindle and exhale the incense they have brought. And while they are busie at their silent devotions, let us have recourse to the Oracle of Reason, and there consult about the powerful Cause of this great and admirable Change in our Matron , who (you see) is no longer either Mourner, or Widow. ¶ To charge this suddain and prodigious Metamorphosis, upon the inherent Mutability and Levity of Womans Nature ; though it may have somewhat of Philosophy in it, yet cannot have much of wisdom; as importing more Reason, than Safety. For, albeit, it be well known, that the softness and tenderness of their Constitution is such, as renders them like wax, capable of any impressions, and especially such as correspond with those their inclinations, that Nature hath implanted in them as goads to drive them on toward that principal End, for which it hath made them: yet, who is so rashly prodigal of his life, as to incense that Revengeful sex, by calling in question that Constancy in affection, which every Woman so much boasteth of, and is ready to defend even with her blood, and whereof every day produceth so many notable Examples? For my part, truly, notwithstanding I was never so happy, as to be much in the Favour of Ladies; yet will not the honour I bear them, permit me willingly to incurre their displeasure, especially by asserting so scandalous an Heresie: nor will I omit any opportunity to demonstrate, that the services I desire to do them, are such as hold exact proportion with the strongest of their Inclinations, and the highest of their Perfections. There is not an Attribute their Excellencies challenge even in their own opinion, (which all allow to be favourable enough,) but I am ready to give it them: nor can I doubt the verity and weight of any thing they say, but admire and believe them as Oracles. My Ears cannot so soon drink in their promises, as my Faith swallows them down, for Sacramental and inviolable obligations. If I hear any Lady but say, (though she use no protestations) that she either hath been, or will be constant and firm to her Servant; I am ready instantly to believe and swear, the Heavens themselves even in their substance are more subject to Alteration, that Nature her self can sooner change her Course, her Laws, and run into the confusion of her primitive Chaos; than she be removed from the Object, upon which she hath placed her Love. When any Widow sighs and weeps at the funeral of her Husband; I compassionate the Reality and Profoundness of her Grief, am afraid she should despair, and destroy her self; and I sooner expect to see her Husband revived, than her to entertain any the least thought of admitting another into her bed. If I but hear the sad story of some young Virgin deprived of her first Love; I cannot forbear to beat my breast, and cry out, Ah! what pity it is, so fair a Flower should be lost to all Mankind, and wither for want of a hand to gather it? For, certainly, she poor Soul, devoting the disconsolate remainder of her days to solitude and Fidelity, will never be brought to listen after another for a Bridegroom; no, without doubt she will live and die a pure Virgin, and all the hopes she hath, are to contemplate the honours reserved in the Elizium, for such Maids as continue true to their departed Sweet-hearts; Nor are your Venetian-locks half so good security of her Chastity, as the memory of the vows she made to the Person, to whom she once gave her Heart. Moreover, when I read those witty and elegant Writers, who have exercised their Pens in illustrating Femal Glories , in erecting Galleries of Heroical Women , and collecting Examples of their Constancy, Conjugal Love, and other Virtues ; O! how am I delighted, how am I enflamed with Emulation of that honour and esteem those Authors have purchased to themselves thereby! And, had my Stars been so propitious and bountiful to my Nativity, as to have inspired me with a competent portion of Wit, I should not have conceived any Argument either so worthy in it self, or so agreeable to my Genius , as the Commendation of Ladies . And I shall not stick to confess to you, as my Friend, that once I had a design in my head, to have compiled a History of the Lives of Constant Wives and Mistresses : nor did any thing hinder my proceeding in that work, but the discouragement I received from the vast Multitude of them; I foresaw my whole Life would be too short but only to enumerate them, much more to give each one her due praises. So that you may well perceive, how irreconcileable an Antipathy I have to any such opinion, as derogates from the Honour due to the Immutability of that delicate and sweet Sex, which the kindness of Nature made for our Comfort, solace, and delight, and without the assistance of which we should fall short of doing that most excellent Act, which witnesseth the perfection of our Being, which makes us immortal in spite of Death, and brings us to some resemblance of the Divine original of all things. Let us, therefore, search for some other Cause (besides the Levity of Womans nature) to salve the adventure that hath befallen our Ephesian Matron . To impute it to the force of the Wine the Souldier gave her, is to passby the Grand and Principal Agent, and rest in what was but an Accessory at most; to lay the whole weight of the wonder upon what seems to have had no more than a finger in it. For, first the Quantity she drank, though sufficient to renovate her spirits, cherish her vital warmth, and quicken the motion of her well-nigh congealed blood; was yet too little to intoxicate her brain, and enflame her to the height of desires so inconsistent, so repugnant to the frigid temper and low condition it found her in. And, as to the Quality of it; though good Wine be the Milk of Venus , and as subtle and powerful a betrayer of Chastity, as a Nurse or Midwife, as Night, as Opportunity, yea as Gold it self, (which the Antients intimated in placing the Chappel of Venus behind the Temple of Bacchus ; and Aristotle , in that speaking of Wine and Drunkenness in his third Problem , he toucheth upon Venery in his fourth: And is a chief reason why the Rhenish-wine Houses are so much frequented by our Gallants.) Yet doth it seldome work that effect, but where it meets with bodies predisposed to admit and concurre with its sprightly and heightning influence. For, as all Natural Agents have their power and energy limited by the capacity of the Patients, upon which they operate; so in particular, Wine is not so universal an inspirer of Amorous and hot inclinations, as not sometimes to meet with resistence and suppression, in persons of cold Temperaments, or chast Resolutions. And, therefore, whensoever it heateth and irritateth to Courtship, it doth no more than add some sparks to that inward Fire, which, however cunningly raked up in the ashes of apparent Modesty, was yet scorching before, and wanted not much of breaking forth into a furious Flame. So that our Matron having not enlarged her draughts beyond the bounds of temperance and sobriety; and being by her long fasting, sorrow, and remaining in the cold, (all which are profest and irreconcilable Enemies to Venus ,) so debilitated, that we ought not to believe she had much of that fewell in her veins, which the spirits of Wine enkindle, when it produceth that burning Appetite we are speaking of: It cannot consist with reason to aggravate her facility, by transferring it wholly upon the innocent means of her refreshment and recovery. To what then may this extraordinary accident be referred? Why, in my judgment, to nothing so favorably and probably, as to the Author of so many wonderfull adventures, Love . For, though I will not undertake to explain the mysterious nature of this Passion, which all are subject to, and none clearly understand; and think it as well defined by him, who said, It is I know not what, which came in I know not whence, and went away I know not how ; as by Socrates , who called it the Desire of Beauty ; or, even by St. Thomas himself, who affirmed it to be, A complacency of the Appetite in the thing which is lovely: Yet thus much I have learned from dear experience, that it is an imperious Passion, which, once entred upon the borders of the mind, instantly becomes a Tyrant, over-running all the faculties, subverting the Laws and government of Reason, and demolishing all the Fortresses, that either Wisdom or Modesty can raise against it. It is a kind of Magick , against which Nature hath given us no power of resistence; for insinuating insensibly into the Soul, like a mask't enemy, it suddenly surpriseth and takes possession of all the strengths of it, and like a subtle poyson, discovers not its entrance, till it be secure of conquest. It proclaims war, and triumphs at once. It betrayeth us with secret complacency, and then hurrieth us toward ruine, which is the more inevitable, because we admit and suffer it with delight. Like the venomous Spiders of Calabria , it destroys us with tickling, and making us dance. While we take it for a sweet and charming harmony, it seduceth us to great and dangerous disorders. It scorneth the prevention of Prudence, and slighteth the prepossession of Grief. It grows more violent by opposition; Counsels do but heighten its fury, and dangers and difficulties, like water poured upon wild- fire, encrease the flames of it; and prohibition provokes it. Being once in love, we believe our desires cannot be noble, untill they are extream; nor generous, unless they be rash. The greatest, the wisest, the most resolved spirits, have felt the force of it; nor is Ambition it self (esteemed Lord Paramount of all the Passions) able to contest with it, for absolute dominion over the soul. For an example of Wisdom , reflect on Solomon , who laid-by all his divine Precepts, and gave himself over to dotage upon Pharaoh's fair daughter: and upon Appius Claudius , Decemvir of Rome , a Law-giver, and most austere man, who yet was transported to a mad degree of love. For one of Ambition , we have Marcus Antonius , half-partner of the great Empire, who in the Zenith of all his power and greatness, found the power of Cleopatra's beauty strong enough to make him her willing captive. And for Resolution , we have the memorable confession of Lais , That she had more Philosophers , and those Stoicks too, her servants, than men of any other sort. Divine Plato (you may remember) confesses himself so passionately in love with his Archianassa , that forgetting his doctrine of Idea's , he knew none but that of her face: and the grave Stagirite sacrificed to his Herpelis , as to Ceres . But what need we these examples, to assure the tyranny of Love over even Heroical Minds, when the frequency of it hath given occasion to men to call it the Heroicall Passion: And when the antient Poets meant no other thing, by their fictions of the Amours of Jupiter and other Deities , but this, that Love mastereth the greatest and wisest men in the world . This considered, what wonder is it, if our Matron, a weak and frail Creature, being shot at by the winged Archer (whose Arrows have this Faculty, that they cure the Ulcers of sorrow in a moment) and pierced to the quick, soon yielded up her self to be led captive among those many millions that attend his triumphant Chariot? So that if this new Affection of hers be a Fault, certainly it is such a one as was not in her power to avoid; and all who understand the force of such secret flames, as we may believe she felt, will easily excuse. Nor ought you to blame her for the Haste she made in the payment of that Homage, which all women owe, and first or last must pay to the Inspirer of such desires; since you know not what strong and pressing Arguments, and Motives the adventurous Souldier used to induce her to that dispatch:  For the Souldier hath ikneled so And told her all his love, and all his wo, And sworn so depe to her to be true, For well or wo, and change for no newe; And as a false Lover so well can plain, The selie Matron rewed on his pain; And toke him for husbond, and became his wife For evermore, while that hem last life. and since the wisest Women commonly esteem those servants most valiant and worthy their favours, who are quickest in obtaining them: qui timid e rogat, docet negare . I am not ignorant, there are a sort of Heretiques in Love, who prize no pleasures that come easily; and think it below their Courage to engarrison that Fort, whose Gates are thrown open at first summons: as if Delight were the more grateful and transcendent for being difficult and tedious in acquisition. But, our Matron was none of these. She was too Wise, too Masculine, to insist upon the nicety of a long Courtship, and thought not the way to oblige, was by delay. No, finding her defences weak, and the Besieger strong; she conceived she might make the better conditions, by how much the sooner she surrendred. Besides, Fortune had fairly given her an opportunity; and Prudence would not permit her to neglect it. There have been many memorable adventures in the World, in which, Time it self hath had a principal hand: and there are certain Fortunate and Critical Minutes wherein many things are to be effected, that ever after are impossible. Why then should this Woman be accused of extream Levity , only for taking occasion by the Foretop , and, at first Encontre, making sure of what, perhaps, she otherways might have lost. When you are Hungry, and have good Meat before you; will you account it kindness in your Host, to detain you from eating, with tedious Ceremonies, and long impertinent discourses, till the dishes are grown cold and unsavory? What reason is there, then, that any one should think it so hainous an offence against the modesty of Woman-hood, that our Matron addressed her self to the satisfaction of an appetite as Natural, (and many times as impatient of delay) as Hunger, as soon as fortune had proffered her the means wherewithal to do it? For my part, seriously (think others what they please) though I will not justifie the Act she did, yet I do not judge it to be the worse, because done so soon . But, you (perhaps) may think, that I have cloathed the deformity of this Womans fact, in too favourable and plausible a dress of Phrase; making that Noble and Heroique passion, Love, to be the Cause of her so easie prostitution, which was, indeed, the meer and proper effect of a Carnal Appetite, or base and unbrideled Lust . To this, therefore, I say; that notwithstanding the nice distinction, which Flattery hath imagined, betwixt Love and Lust ; as if one were the genuine offspring of the Mind alone; the other the spurious issue of the Body, which never intruded her self into the society of her Sister, without debauching and dishonouring her Virgin and immaculate Nature: yet those unprejudicate Enquirers, who have searched deep enough into the Origine and essence of that desire of Conjunction in persons of different Sexes, or the Appetite of Male and Female each to other, which is generally understood to be Love , (for, we are not now upon the consideration of Amity , or Friendship ) will not be easily perswaded, that there is any so great dissimilitude or Disparity betwixt them, as that they may not be deduced from one and the same principle, at least, that they can be divided. This, I presume, will be somewhat distasteful to the pure and refined Disciples of the Platonique sect, who profess to be ennamoured only on the beauties of the Soul , wholly rejecting all respects of flesh and blood, and entirely devoting their Courtship to contemplate, and entranse themselves in admiration of the lovely Idea's of Virtue : nor will the Ladies (made, doubtless of a mold much finer and less sulphureous, than other courser Mortals are,) be well pleased to hear their sweet and cleanly Flames should be aspersed with the mixture of gross and sooty Exhalations, such as arise from ardors of the Body. And, therefore, Truth it self, (which I prefer to all other interests) engageth me to assert this my opinion, and make it appear, that though it be a Paradox , yet it is highly Reasonable . Which that I may do, I aske leave to present you a Picture of Love in little , not copied from the descriptions of other mens Phansies, but drawn to the life from the very original of Nature, and (if I am not much mistaken) so full of true resemblances, that who so shall attentively contemplate the same, will, I doubt not, esteem it as a piece, not altogether unworthy to be preserved in the Cabinet of their Memory. , is Good , either Real, or only Apparent; and the Reason is, because the Object, in which this Good is perceived or apprehended, is conducible to the perfection of that thing; whose the Appetite is, or which desireth it. For, Appetite or desire always presupposeth in the thing desiring, a want or Need of the thing desired; and what is in want cannot be perfect, without receiving what it doth want So that the Agreeableness , or Profitableness , or Good , which is betwixt the Nature of the thing wanted, or desired, and the perfection requisite in the Nature of the thing wanting or desiring; is the Cause why it is desired, or loved; and also the ground of that Pleasure or Delight, which is perceived in the obtaining or Fruition of it. And this, certainly, is the Foundation of all the Inclinations, that are to be found in Nature; and of the Love we have for all that is truly, or seemingly Good for us. I say, Good for us; because there is no such thing in the World, as Good Absolute ; nor do we account any thing Good, but with Respect to our selves. Now, forasmuch as the agreeableness in the object, to the nature of the thing desiring it, is the cause both of the Appetite's being particularly determined to it, as that which serveth to its perfection (which consisteth only in the advancement of its Power into Act,) and also of that Pleasure which attends the attainment of it: it cannot be denied, but the Appetite is accompanied or rather ushered by a Faculty of Knowing or discerning that Agreeableness, wheresoever it meeteth with it among objects, and that directeth the Appetite therunto; since, what is not known to be Agreeable, cannot be desired. And since those inward Motions, which men call Love and Pleasure , are but the results of such Conceptions, as are formed in the Imagination and Understanding, after the Appetite hath been excited by the Good or Convenience of the thing proposed to it; There must be therefore a faculty of knowing what is Convenient, what not. And since to know a thing, is to have a Conception, or Notion of it, correspondent to its Nature , which declareth or manifesteth its self only by its Qualities and Proprieties: those Qualities are the Signs or Marks , by which the Faculty Cognitive is enabled to judge of its Good, or Evil, and accordingly represent it to the Appetite , to be embraced or rejected. And this, as it is the reason why Nature furnished all Animals with senses, and Man, with both sense and Reason, by which, the Marks or Signs of Convenience in objects, may be perceived, and so the Nature of the thing, in which they appear, be made known to the Faculty, whose Function it is to judge of them: So is it likewise of this, that whatsoever the senses (the observers of the marks of Good and Evil) represent to the Imagination (which formeth Conceptions of them accordingly) for Good, Profitable, or Agreeable, is accounted Good, or Fair, or Beautiful, and afterward desired or pursued by the Appetite. This considered, the rule of pure Consequence teacheth, that the reason why Corporal Beauty so delighteth the senses, and ravisheth the soul, is only because it is a Mark or Sign of that interior power or agreeableness, which is in the subject to which it adhereth, and which our Appetite wanteth, in order to its attainment of that perfection, which is required to its nature. So that, in this Sense, we cannot much find fault with his definition of Beauty , who called it the splendor of Goodness ; nor condemn his of Love , who termed it Need , or want. And this we conceive sufficient to adumbrate the Nature of Love in General . all the Powers or Faculties, which together with their respective Appetites, compleat the Nature of Man, were conferred upon him for one of these two ends; either for the well-being and conservation of him in his single and Individual person; or for the conservation of him in specie , or in his kind. Those which conduce to the well-being and conservation of him in his Person, are the Faculties of Understanding or Reasoning , of Imagination , of Memory , of Voluntary Motion , of Life , and of Nutrition ; And that which continueth him in his Kind, is the Faculty of Generation , or Procreation , by which he begets his like. Now this Power-Generative , (for the rest belong not to our present Theme) being not wholly in the Male, nor wholly in the Female, but divided betwixt them, the Active part being the propriety of the Male, and the Passive of the Female; so that the Conjunction of both Sexes is necessary to the perfection of this Power, which consisteth in the actual production of their like: it is not to be doubted, but the Appetite belonging to this Power, and by which both Male and Female are solicited, and as it were, impelled to the Act of Generation, to which this Faculty tendeth, is accompanied with a certain Knowledge of the Goodness or Fitness in the object, upon which it is to operate, in order to the attainment of its perfection. And this Goodness or Fitness, being not otherwise to be known but by the outward Marks, or signs of it appearing in Male and Female, is no sooner discovered to the senses and Imagination, but the Appetite attending that knowledge, is excited and set on work to Love and pursue that object, in which that Fitness doth appear. To speak more plainly; the Goodness or Fitness to Generation in the Male, being nothing but the due Constitution of him in all those Organs or Instruments, which Nature hath ordained for the performance of that Function, on his part; and likewise the Fitness in the Female, being the due Constitution, of the Instruments, provided by Nature for the execution of that passive power, which is on hers; and the Marks, by which that Fitness makes it self known, being the shape and form of the body, and all its parts peculiar to each sex: hence it unavoidably follows, that the Male-Beauty is only the mark of the good Constitution for the Active power in Generation; as the Female-Beauty is only the mark of the Passive ; and that the Desire or Appetite, which ariseth upon the discovery of those signs, and solliciteth either Male or Female to the Act of Conjunction, in order to the performance of the Function proper to the power Generative, is that passion we call Love of a different sex . For, the desire, which carrieth toward the end, must be introduced by a knowledge of the Fitness of the means tending thereto; and that Fitness consisting in the due Constitution of all parts or organs requisite to the attainment of the end, and discovering it self only by the outward Pulchritude of the body, peculiar to each sex: it cannot be denyed, but that Fitness is the only Motive to the Appetite; nor that the Desire arising upon the Knowledge of that Fitness, is the Love , and the only Love that can be betwixt Male and Female, as Male and Female. the Appetite of Procreation Indefinite, there is yet another Love, in which the same Appetite, though respecting diversity of sex, is yet determined to some one particular Person ; and such as are in this Passion, are properly said to be in Love . Now the Question doth concern, not the General Love betwixt Male and Female, but this Particular or Determined Love: since this seems to be that, which Ladys mean, when they distinguish Love from Lust . Concerning this Personal Love , therefore, I say; that forasmuch as it cannot be without diversity of Sex, and tendeth as violently, (it not more) to the same end, as the general or indefinite Love doth, viz. to the Act of Procreation; and in both those respects doth participate of that sensual pleasure, which accompanieth the indifferent Love: it follows, that Love of the Sex, and Love of some one person of that Sex, make but one and the same affection or Passion in Nature . Nor is there indeed, any other cause that makes this Love quit its indifferency to all of that divers Sex, and fix only upon some one single person, but only this; that the person Loving, (or rather in Love) apprehending that the Marks or Signs of the power Generative are more conspicuous in the person loved, than in any other of that Sex; thereupon imagineth, that the Fruition of that person, (that is, the doing that Act, which is necessary to continuation of the kind, with that person) will better conduce to the satisfaction of the Appetite to Generation, than the doing of it with any other. So that this Opinion or Imagination in the person loving, is the cause why the person loved, is courted and pursued with that violence of desire, which always agitateth and disquieteth those that are in Love. And hence it comes, that comely and proper men (as they call them) such as are of good complexions, and well proportioned bodies, are generally in great reputation with Women: and fair and Beautiful Women, in as high esteem and honour with Men. For, it being a certain rule in Nature, that all inward powers are more or less perfect, according to the more or less exact temperament and structure of the parts of the body, upon which they depend; and that the exact shape and constitution of the body and all its parts, are marks of the perfection of the same powers: where the senses discover the Marks in a more eminent measure, there the soul concludeth to find the Powers themselves also in as eminent a degree; and thereupon loves and pursues with proportionate ardency, the person in whom they appear to be. For particular instance; Comliness and Strength of body in a Man, being signs of the goodness of the power Generative; Women no sooner perceive those signs, but well understanding what they signifie, they cannot chuse but have a greater liking, esteem and inclination for such men, in whom they appear, than for others, in whom they do not appear, at least so conspicuously. On the other side, sweetness of complexon, justness of stature, and all that is comprized in the word Beauty , being the Character which Nature hath imprinted upon a Woman, by which we may judge of the Goodness of the passive power in Generation, in such a Woman; no sooner is this Character discerned by the eyes of men, but they instantly know what it imports, and thereupon honour and love those Women, in whom that Mark is seen more than others, in whom it doth not shew it self, in so full a measure. To confirm the Truth of this, besides the Natural Reasons here alledged, we have also the suffrage of Experience . For, what woman was ever in love with an Eunuch , though otherwise exceedingly handsome? Nay, what Woman is there, that doth not secretly despise any man, of whose insufficiency (whether Native, or by Misfortune) in the power of Generation, she hath had any the least notice? on the otherside, what Man hath ever continued his passion for a Woman, after he hath been once convinced of her impotency to club with him in the Act of procreation, though she were, in all other things, the most beautiful of her Sex? Which considered; I confess, I find my self a little inclined to suspect, that few wives who have no Children by their Husbands, love them half so well as they pretend: and that as few Husbands abstain from breach of wedlock, who have reason to complain of the Barrenness of their Wives. For, though Discretion may make them secret and close in their amorous stealths, yet (without the restraint of great virtue) desire of Issue, and experiment of their Abilities, will go neer to make them affect change. Now, after all this, I hope it will be no longer a Paradox, that the indefinite desire of different Sex (which is generally called Lust) and desire of some one particular person of that different Sex (which is generally called Love,) are one and the same Appetite to the Act of Procreation. Nevertheless that I may not seem either ignorant of what hath given occasion to men to imagine a real difference betwixt them, or willing to innovate a vulgar phrase, by which they express their different sentiments; I shall not omit to observe, that when we Condemn this Appetite, we give it the disparageing name of Lust ; and when we Approve it, we cloath it in the neater word, Love : so that Lust and Love, nevertheless, are no more but divers Terms, by which we express the divers Conceptions we have of one and the same Passion. Nor will it be a whit to my disadvantage, if I add also; that the desire of different Sex in general, is not accompanied with that Delight of the Mind , as the Determined or personal Love is; since, in the Former, men seek only to please themselves, whereas in the Latter, they seek to please the Woman, whom they love, as much as, if not more than themselves; and by how much more they find themselves able to please their Mistresses, by so much the more are they Delighted themselves. For, this Delight is not sensual, as being that Pleasure or joy of the Mind, which consisteth in the opinion we have of our own Power or Ability to please another, especially, the Person whom we love; and therefore an effect rather of Charity (which is a Desire to assist another in obtaining what he wanteth, or is pleased with when he hath it) than of this Love betwixt Male and Female, of which I now discourse: and so hinders not, Love and Lust to be still one and the same thing, as I have proved it to be. such profess, who distinguish themselves from the herd of sensual Inamorato's, by the title of Platoniques : which that we may do impartially, it is requisite we enquire first into the Original , and then the Truth of the Opinion, (which they in profession at least) hold. Plato , in his Dialogue intituled Convivium , or, The Banquet (the Argument whereof is Honorable Love ) bringeth in Socrates , a wise, grave, and continent Philosopher, taking high delight in the society of Alcibiades , a beautiful Youth; and loving him passionately, though virtuously, not for any sensual respect, but only to impregnate him with that Knowledge and those Virtues, with which his own Mind was pregnant, and which he perceived Alcibiades was capable of, and which he desired to infuse into him by continual instructions and example. And the sum of Plato's Opinion concerning this kind of Love, is this. That a Man, whose Mind is full of Wisdom and other Virtues, is naturally inclined to seek out, and dearly affect some beautifull person, of age and capacity to conceive, in whom he may by frequent instructions and familiar wayes of insinuation, beget or produce the like Wisdome and Virtues: and that the delight he receives therein is very great, as the Motive to it is very honorable. And this is the Idea of true Platonick Love. Now, as for the Truth of this opinion; though it be honourable to instruct the ignorant, and sow the seeds of virtue in the minds of such as though fertil in capacity, were yet actually barren of them before; and though it be a high delight of the Mind to propagate knowledge, and make the wisdom of others derive it self from the bounty of ours: yet am I not convinced, either that there is any such strong natural inclination generally in wise and virtuous persons, to seek and court the ignorant and prone to vice, that they may instruct and make them like themselves; because Experience assureth that few Learned and Prudent men are so easily Communicative, as Plato represents Socrates to have been, at least, out of meer Natural inclination; or that they select none but beautiful and youthful persons to become their Schollars, since Beauty of the body is not always a certain mark of singular Capacity in the Mind to Science and Virtue; and there have been many eminent in both, who yet were not adorned with Corporal comeliness. In this particular, therefore, I am inclined to be of Lucian's belief, who, though a great admirer of generous Friendship as his excellent discourse, Intituled ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/PHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  sufficiently witnesseth; doth yet suspect the honesty of this Platonique Love , in his ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ' ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , where he saith plainly, Animi amorem quendam cominiscuntur; & cum corporis pulchritudinem vereantur amare, virtutis sese vocant amatores . But, granting the opinion to be wholly true, as Plato delivers it; yet that Inclination, of Desire to eradicate Ignorance and Vice, and plant Wisdom and virtue in the Mind of another, is, indeed, nothing but Charity (which is a generous passion, by which we are willing and desirous to assist and advance others, as well as our selves) and hath nothing in it of that Sexual Love , of which we have now discoursed. Again, if Socrates's honourable Love, be the same with our Charity (as evidently it is) why should it not be more honourable Love, or greater Charity, to endeavour to give perfections of the Mind, to such as are deficient in those of the body; than to give them to those, who seem so much the less to desire or value their inward beauties, by how much the more they possess of the outward; since Want is always the measure of Charity? Furthermore, though Socrates might be continent ; it follows not, that therefore all were so, who afterward adhered to this opinion: witness the P aedagogue in Petronius Arbiter , and many others, whose stories Modesty will not suffer me to relate. Once more; Were all Plato's Disciples in this particular, Continent; yet it is not necessary their Love should be therefore Pure , or void of all sensual respects: because (as the greatest Philosopher of our age hath excellently observed) The Continent have the passion they contain, as much, and more than they that satiate the Appetite . But leaving Plato's opinion, let us see how the Love which our Modern Platoniques pretend to be justifiable thereby, do agree therewith. First, our Platoniques are generally of different sexes ; whereas Socrates and his Darling, Alcibiades , were both Masculine. Secondly, ours are commonly both Young , and in the Canicular or scorching years of life: but Socrates was Ancient , and superannuated for the incitements of wanton desires. Thirdly, Ours are generally far short of that Wisdome and those Virtues, that are requisite to engender the like Excellencies in others. Again, Ours pretend to love, because they would Learn , not Teach, and the Male Platonique (forsooth) is ever admiring and extolling the content he takes in contemplating the Idea's of those rare Virtues, which he discovers daily in the Female while she (good modest Soul) is as much transported with those perfections of Mind, she discerns in Him: when indeed, those Virtues and Excellences are kept so close, that no person else can perceive any such in either of them. Lastly, Ours, (especially the Women) are for the most part Married to others, and so ought to propagate Virtue, (if they have so much as to spare) rather in their Husbands and children, than in Strangers: but, alas! those Relations are despised, in comparison of the Noble Lover ; who alone deserves to be made wiser and better. I could reckon up many other Differences more, but these are enough to let you see, what vast disparity is betwixt the Platonique Love of the Ancients, and that of Modern Puritan Lovers; and how little reason they have to usurp either the Example of Socrates , or authority of Plato , for their patronage, I hope, therefore, the wise and virtuous will not be offended, if I take leave (without prejudice to that noble Amity, called Friendship) to suspect that this Platonique Passion is but an honourable pretence to conceal a sensual Appetite, and is (in plain truth) Cousin German at least to that Love, which made our Ephesian Matron so gentle and obliging to the Souldier. To whom I think we may now return, without disturbing him in those pleasures, we saw him addressing himself to reap, in the bosome of his new Mistress, when we left them to their mutual solace. ¶. See the vicisitudes of contrary Passions , which keep their turns in agitating and perplexing the unsettled mind of Man! See the Unconstancy of Fortune , which now frowns and turns her back upon the same person, whom but an hour since she seemed to court, and indulge with the choicest of her favours! Or, see rather the method of Fate , which entertaineth us with such a mixture of Sweet and Bitter, as that no Pleasure is sincere; which (like Physicians) hath few Cordials without some Poyson in them; and which seldome feasteth us, without obliging us to tast of some dish of the second Course, that makes us, with nauseousness and regrete, soon disgorge the delicious morsels of the first. For, Returning to the Souldier , whom not many minutes since, we left in a condition of so much joy and pleasure, that C aesar himself, had he beheld him, could not have forborn to envy his felicity, and wish himself in his place; we find a greater change in him, than he had lately wrought in the despairing Matron; and perceive him striving more to destroy himself than he had before to preserve Her. Fear, Anger, Rage , and Despair , have conspired to distract him. One while he casteth up his eyes, that flame with fury; beats his breast; tears his hair; stampeth upon the ground; and useth all the gesture of a man transported to perfect madness with sudden and violent passion. Another while, he stands unmoved, silent, and with eyes fixt upon the earth; as if he were consulting the infernal spirits, what to do with himself. Then suddenly starting, he rouls about his sparkling eyes, lifts up his head, sighs as if he would crack the Fibres of his heart, and breaks forth into short and incoherent, but desperate ejaculations. He exclaims even against Heaven ; he defies Fate to make him more miserable; he reproaches Fortune with her giddiness; he curses the malevolence of his Stars , and renounces Providence . Now he condemns himself for negligence; then he reflects upon the innocent Woman , as the unhappy occasion of his wretchedness; and thinking that then he had lighted upon the true and chief cause of his Calamity, he falls to imprecate all the plagues and dire mischiefs in nature upon the heads of her whole Sex and vomits out these blasphemies against them. "Ah Woman, woman (saith he) why did Nature make you, unless, repenting the perfection she had given to Man, she found out you to lessen it again? For, Man who otherwise would be more than half- Divine ; only by being obnoxious to the corrupt temptations of Woman, is made less then half- Human . What misery ever befell him, in which Woman had not a hand? What crime did he ever commit; to which she did not incite him? What Tragedy hath at any time been acted in the Theatre of the world, in which a Woman had not her part? What war, What desolation, What ruine hath not found its beginning in that mischievous Sex? How many mighty Nations, flourishing Kingdoms, prosperous Common-wealths, populous Cities, and noble Families, have owed their destruction, to either the Malice or Pride, or Lust of Woman? What are you Women, but the poyson of Man's Innocence and Peace, which Nature hath gilded over with a splendid out-side, that we might swallow it down with the less suspicion? All your beauties, all your charms are but like the apples of Sodom , which have fair and inviting rinds, and yet within are nothing but stinking dust; you are the true Sirens , that enchant us with the melody of your voyce, and then hold us captives in the chains of beastial slavery. You are the true Hiena's , that allure us with the fairness of your skins; and when folly hath brought us within your reach, you leap upon us and devour us. You are the traiters to Wisdom; the impediment to Industry; the obstacles to honour; the softners of courage; the perturbers of tranquility; the clogs to virtue, and goads that drive us to all Vice, Impiety and Ruine. You are the Fools Paradise, the Wisemans Plague, and the grand Error of Nature. What shall I say? I want words to express your pravity; as I did my Reason when I set my foot into this unlucky, this fatal place."  Detestor omnes, horreo, fugeo, execror. Sit ratio, sit natura, sit dirus furor; Odisse placuit. Having thus belched out this invective against poor innocent Women (who deserved much better language at his hands) his wild imagination, (which catcheth at any thing) wheels about, and he thus vomits the remainder of his Choller upon himself. "What damned Spirit was it that conducted me into this Charnel-house, and made me quit my duty? Where was the care and Vigilancy of my Good Angel, when he left me to be seduced into this dismal Vault? Would I had fallen into a den of Lyons and Tygers, when I lighted upon this Woman here: then had I dyed innocent, and without dishonour; whereas now I have contracted a guilt, whose punishment is an infamous death, and that inevitable, unless I prevent the stroke of Justice, and become my own Executioner. Which being the only refuge my Disaster hath left me; why am I thus slow in addressing my self unto it? why do I waste that time, in weak and fruitless complaints, which I ought to imploy in delivering my self from the extreamity of my misfortune, that is yet to come? Dye I must by sentence of the Magistrate; why then should I defer to fall by my own hand? To vindicate ones self from extream, and otherwise inevitable Calamity, by Sui-cide is not (certainly) a Crime, but an act of Heroique Fortitude. I am resolved therefore, my sword shall prevent the ignominy of the Gallows, and by forcing open the Gates of death, I will stop up the way to publique shame."  Caecus est ignis stimulatus ira Nec Regi curat, patiturve fraenos: Haud timet mortem; cupit ire in ipsos obvius enses. Here, he puts a period to his desperate Harangue, and hasting to put one to his life also, he suddainly unsheath's his sword; and beginning to set the Hilt of it upon the ground, that he may cast himself upon the point, he is most seasonably prevented by the pious Matron . Who being all this while ignorant of the Cause of his Fury, had been wholly possessed with amazement at the extravagant effects of it; so that she minded not a word of all those bitter reproaches he had cast forth against her whole Sex; but quickly rowsed out of the stupifying fit of wonder, wherewith she had been invaded, by seeing him draw his sword; she throws her self into his arms, and partly by grasping his hands, partly by the charms of her kisses, tears, and entreaties, she so far becalms his rage, as that he seems not unwilling to prorogue at least the execution of that self-assasination, he intended, until he had convinced her of the necessity of it. "He tells her therefore, in short, that the body of a certain notorious villain, which he had been appointed to guard, was taken down from the Gibbet, and convey'd away; that the penalty of the like death, denounced by the Governour against him and his fellows (who had transferred the whole charge upon his care and vigilancy) was certain and inevitable, unless he killed himselfe, by way of prevention; that if she could have any sentiments of kindness for so unfortunate a wretch, as this sad Accident had made him; there was now no way left for her to express them, but by permitting him quietly to avert the infamy of a publique Execution, by a private with-drawing himself into the other world; and that it was some content to him, in this his Agony, that he should leave his body to be dissolved into the same dust with that of her former Lover, of whose singular Worth, Fame hath diffused so honourable a report." And having thus hastily delivered to her the Cause of his desperate Resolution, he begins again to free his hands of the encumbrance of hers, that he may speedily effect it. But, good and tender hearted Creature ! her Affection was too great, to suffer her to yield to any thing conducing to his death; and the more he strives to disingage her breast from his, the closer she clings to him; vowing withal, "That if he wounded himself, it should be by forcing the sword first through her body. To which she added, that she would not live to be so miserable, as to lose so dear a person so soon, and in the same place, where she had been so happy to find him unexpectedly; that, very Gratitude forbad her to consent to the taking away his life, who had lately and miraculously preserved hers, and (as she had some reason to believe) infused a new life into her; that it would be less affliction to her, to die before him, than to survive and behold at once the dead bodies of Two persons, each of which she had loved infinitely above her own life; and that the death so much dreaded from from the Hangman, was not so unavoidable, as his Fears had made him imagine, but there were other ways of evasion, besides self-murder, and would he but follow her advice, she doubted not to put him upon such a course, as should procure both his own security and her content." The Soldier , more effectually wrought upon by this last clause, than by all else she had said; and remembring the old saying, that Women are always more subtle and ingenious at Evasions, in suddain Exigenses, than men : he easily promiseth (as who would not in his case?) to listen to her Counsel, and pursue it also, if it appeared reasonable. "Well then, saith this Good-Woman ; since the body of the best and greatest of mortals, is but a lump of Clay, after the departure of the soul, which gave it life, sense, and motion; that all Relations are extinguished in Death, all Piety is determined in the Grave; and that it is but Charity to use the reliques of the Dead, in case of necessity, to preserve the Living: why should not I dispense with the Formality of posthume Respects to the putrifying Corps of my deceased Husband, and make use of it for the preservation of my living Friend, with whose life my own is inseparably bound up, and whose danger, therefore is equally mine? Come, therefore, my Dear, and let us take my Husbands body out of his Coffin and place it upon the Gibbet, in the room of the Malefactor, which you say hath been stoln away. Death (you know) doth so change  & disfigure the Countenance, as to disguise it from the knowledge of even the most familiar Acquaintance. Who then can distinguish this his naked body from the other? Besides, we will besmear his face with blood and dirt, and rather than fail in any part of resemblance, break his Arms and Legs, and make the same wounds in him, the Executioner did in the Rogue's: so that his neerest Relations shall not be able to find a difference, much less shall strangers, who come to gaze upon such horrid spectacles, out of a savage Curiosity, and commonly stand aloof off." Here I cannot but cry out with Father, Chaucer , in his Ballad of the praise of Women .  Lo what gentillesse these women have, If we could knowe it for our rudeness. How busie thei be us to keepe and save Both in heale, and also in sickness, And alwaie right sorie for our distress. In every maner thus shewe thei routh, Tthat in hem is all goodness and trouth. For of all creatures that ever were get and born, This wote ye well, a woman was the best. By her was recovered the bliss that we had lorne: And through the woman we shall come to rest, And been isaved, if that our self lest. Wherefore me thinketh, if that we had grace, We oughten honour women in every place. The Souldier quickly approves the Woman's project, how to excuse him; and having no time (for, now day was approaching) to insist upon acknowledgement either of her great Love, or of the felicity of her Wit: he joyns his strength with hers, and removes the Husband's Corps out of the Vault to the Gibbet, whereon he placeth it, in the same posture, he had left the villains, omitting no part of those resemblances she had suggested, as requisite to delude the spectators. Which done, He and his incomparable Mistress secretly retire to his obscure lodging, there to consult further, not only of their present safety, but also how they might continue that mutual happiness, which Fortune had so unexpectedly begun betwixt them. And while they are there deliberating, give me leave to deliver my self of a certain Conceipt I have in my head, which is, that the witty invention this Matron lighted upon, on the suddain, and in desperate extremity, was that which gave the first occasion to this Proverb, A Womans wit is always best at a dead lift .
