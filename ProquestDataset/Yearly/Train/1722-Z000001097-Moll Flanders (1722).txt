 But as this Work is chiefly recommended to those who know how to read it, and how to make the good Uses of it, which the Story all along recommends to them; so it is to be hop'd that such Readers will be much more pleas'd with the Moral, than the Fable, with the Application than with the Relation, and with the end of the Writer than with the Life of the Person written of. There is in this Story abundance of delightful Incidents, and all of them usefully apply'd. There is an agreeable turn Artfully given them in the relating, that naturally Instructs the Reader, either one way, or another. The first part of her lew'd Life with the young Gentleman at Colchester, has so many happy Turns given it to expose the Crime, and warn all whose Circumstances are adapted to it, of the ruinous End of such things, and the foolish Thoughtless and abhor'd Conduct of both the Parties, that it abundantly attones for all the lively Description she gives of her Folly and Wickedness. The Repentance of her Lover at the Bath, and how brought by the just alarm of his Fit of Sickness to abandon her; the just Caution given there against even the lawful Intimacies of the dearest Friends, and how unable they are to preserve the most solemn Resolutions of Virtue without divine Assistance; these are Parts, which to a just Discernment will appear to have more real Beauty in them, than all the amorous Chain of Story, which introduces it. In a Word, as the whole Relation is carefully garbled of all the Levity and Looseness that was in it? So it is applied, and with the utmost care to vertuous and religious Uses. None can without being guilty of manifest Injustice, cast any Reproach upon it, or upon our Design in publishing it. The Advocates for the Stage, have in all Ages made this the great Argument to perswade People that their Plays are useful, and that they ought to be allow'd in the most civiliz'd, and in the most religious Government; namely, that they are apply'd to vertuous Purposes, and that by the most lively Representations, they fail not to recommend Virtue, and generous Principles, and to discourage and expose all sorts of Vice and Corruption of Manners; and were it true that they did so, and that they constantly adhered to that Rule, as the Test of their acting on the Theatre, much might be said in their Favour. Throughout the infinite variety of this Book, this Fundamental is most strictly adhered to; there is not a wicked Action in any Part of it, but it first or last readened Unhappy and Unfortunate: There is not a superlative Villian brought upon the Stage, but either he is brought to an unhappy End, or brought to be a Penitent: There is not an ill thing mention'd, but it is condemn'd, even in the Relation, nor a vertuous just thing, but it carries it's Praise along with it: What can more exactly answer the Rule laid down, to recommend, even those Representations of things which have so many other just Objections lying against them? Namely, of Example, of bad Company, obscene language, and the like. Upon this Foundation this Book is recommended to the Reader, as a Work from every part of which something may be learned, and some just and religious Inference is drawn by which the Reader will have something of Instruction, if he pleases to make use of it. All the Explois of this Lady of Fame, in her Depredations upon Mankind stand as so many warnings to honest People to beware of 'em, intimating to 'em by what Methods innocent People are drawn in, plunder'd and rob'd, and by Consequence how to avoid them.  Her robing a little Child, dress'd fine by the Vanity of the Mother, to go to the Dancing School, is a good Memento to such People hereafter; as is likewise her picking the Gold-Watch from the young Ladies side in the Park. Her getting a parcel from a hair-brain'd Wench at the Coaches in St. John's \- street ; her Booty at the Fire, and also at Harwich ; all give us excellent Warning in such Cases to be more present to ourselves in sudden Surprizes of every Sort. Her application to a sober Life, and industrious Management at last in Virginia, with her Transported Spouse, is a Story fruitful of Instruction, to all the unfortunate Creatures who are oblig'd to seek their Re-establishment abroad; whether by the Misery of Transportation, or other Disaster; letting them know that Diligence and Application have their due Encouragement, even in the remotest part of the World, and that no Case can be so low, so despicable, or so empty of Prospect, but that an unwearied Industry will go a great way to deliver us from it, will in time raise the meanest Creature to appear again in the World, and give him a new Cast for his Life. These are a few of the serious Inferences which we are led by the Hand to in this Book, and these are fully sufficient to Justify any Man in recommending it to the World, and much more to Justify the Publication of it. There are two of the most beautiful Parts still behind, which this Story gives some Idea of, and lets us into the Parts of them, but they are either of them too long to be brought into the same Volume; and indeed are, as I may call them, whole Volumes of themselves, viz.  The Life of her Governess as she calls her, who had ran thro', it seems in a few Years all the eminent degrees of a Gentlewoman, a Whore, and a Bawd; a Midwife, and a Midwife keeper, as they are call'd, a Pawn-broker, a Child- taker, a Receiver of Thieves, and of stolen Goods; and in a Word, herself a Thief, a Breeder up of Thieves, and the like, and yet at last a Penitent. The second is the Life of her Transported Husband, a Highway-man; who it seems liv'd a twelve Years Life of successful Villany upon the Road, and even at last came off so well, as to be a Voluntier Transport, not a Convict; and in whose Life there is an incredible Variety. But as I said, these are things too long to bring in here so neither can I make a Promise of their coming out by themselves. We cannot say indeed, that his History is carried on quite to the End of the Life of this famous Moll Flanders, for no Body can write their own Life to the full End of it, unless they can write it after they are dead; but her Husband's Life being written by a third Hand, gives a full Account of them both, how long they liv'd together in that Country, and how they came both to England again, after about eight Years, in which time they were grown very Rich, and where she liv'd it seems, to be very old; but was not so extraordinary a Penitent, as she was at first; it seems only that indeed she always spoke with abbhorence of her former Life, and of every Part of it. In her last Scene at Maryland, and Virginia, many pleasant things happen'd, which makes that part of her Life very agreeable, but they are not told with the same Elegancy as those accounted for by herself; so it is still to the more Advantage that we break off here. and in the Old-Bailey, and there are some things of such Consequence still depending there, relating to my particular Conduct, that it is not to expected I should set my Name, or the Account of my Family to this Work; perhaps, after my Death it may be better known, at present it would not be proper, no, not tho' a general Pardon should be issued, even without Exceptions of Persons or Crimes. of the Way of doing me Harm, having gone out of the World by the Steps, and the String; as I often expected to go, knew me by the Name of Moll Flanders ; so you may give me leave to go under that Name till I dare own who I have been, as well as who I am. France, or where else, I know not, they have an Order from the King, that when any Criminal is condemn'd, either to Dye, or to the Gallies, or to be Transported, if they leave any Children, as such are generally unprovided for, by the Forfeiture of their Parents. so they are immediately taken into the Care of the Government, and put into an Hospital call'd the House of Orphans, where they are Bred up, Cloath'd, Fed, Taught, and when fit to go out, are placed to Trades, or to Services, so as to be well able to provide for themselves by an honest industrious Behaviour. desolate Girl without Friends, without Cloaths, without Help or Helper, as was my Fate; and by which, I was not only expos'd to very great Distresses, even before I was capable, either of understanding my Case, or how to amend it, but brought into a Course of Life, scandalous in itself, and which in its ordinary Course, tended to the swift Destruction both of Soul and Body. petty Theft, scarce worth naming, viz. borrowing three Pieces of fine Holland, of a certain Draper in Cheap-side: The Circumstances are too long to repeat, and I have heard them related so many Ways, that I can scarce tell which is the right Account. and being found quick with Child, she was respited for about Seven Months; after which she was call'd down, as they term it, to her former Judgment, but obtain'd the Favour afterward of being Transported to the Plantations, and left me about Half a Year old; and in bad Hands you may be sure. my self, but by hearsay; 'tis enough to mention, that as I was born in such an unhappy Place, I had no Parish to have Recourse to for my Nourishment in my Infancy, nor can I give the least Account how I was kept alive; other, than that, as I have been told, some Relation of my Mother took me away, but at whose Expence, or by whose Direction I know nothing at all of it. was that I had wander'd among a Crew of those People they call Gypsies, or Egyptians ; but I believe it was but a little while that I had been among them, for I had not had my Skin discoloured, as they do to all Children they carry about with them, nor can I tell how I came among them, or how I got from them. Notion in my Head, that I left them there, (that is, that I hid my self and would not go any farther with them) but I am not able to be particular in that Account; only this I remember, that being taken up by some of the Parish Officers of Colchester, I gave an Account, that I came into the Town with the Gypsies, but that I would not go any farther with them, and that so they had left me, but whither they were gone that I knew not, for tho' they sent round the Country to enquire after them, it seems, they could not be found. upon this, or that Part of the Town by Law; yet as my Case came to be known, and that I was too young to do any Work, being not above three Years old, Compassion mov'd the Magistrates of the Town to take Care of me, and I became one of their own as much as if I had been born in the Place. as they call it, to a Woman who was indeed Poor, but had been in better Circumstances, and who got a little Livelihood by taking such as I was suppos'd to be; and keeping them with all Necessaries, till they were at a certain Age, in which it might be suppos'd they might go to Service, or get their own Bread. Read and to Work; and having, I say, liv'd before that in good Fashion, she bred up the Children with a great deal of Art, as well as with a great deal of Care. being herself a very sober pious Woman. (2.) Very Housewifely and Clean, and, (3.) Yery Mannerly, and with good Behaviour: So that excepting a plain Diet, course Logding, and mean Cloaths, we were brought up as Mannerly, as if we had been at the Dancing School. News, that the Magistrates (as I think they call'd them) had ordered that I should go to Service; I was able to do but very little where ever I was to go, except it was to run of Errands, and be a Drudge to some Cook-Maid, and this they told me of often, which put me into a great Fright; for I had a thorough Aversion to going to Service, as they call'd it, tho' I was so young; and I told my Nurse, that I believ'd I could get my Living without going to Service if she pleased to let me, for she had Taught me to Work with my Needle, and Spin Worsted, which is the chief Trade of that City, and I told her that if she would keep me, I would Work for her, and I would Work very hard. nothing but Work and Cry all Day, which grieved the good kind Woman so much, that at last she began to be concern'd for me, for she lov'd me very well. were at Work, she sat down just over against me, not in her usual Place as Mistress, but as if she had set herself on purpose to observe me, and see me Work: I was doing something she had set me to, as I remember it was Marking some Shirts, which she had taken to Make, and after a while she began to Talk to me: Thou foolish Child, says she, thou art always Crying, (for I was Crying then) Prithee, What do'st Cry for? because they will take me away, says I, and put me to Service, and I can't work House-Work; well Child, says she, but tho' you can't work House-Work you will learn it in time, and they won't put you to hard Things at first; yes they will, says I, and if I can't do it, they will Beat me, and the Maids will Beat me to make me do great Work, and I am but a little Girl, and I can't do it, and then I cry'd again, till I could not speak any more. Service yet, so she bid me not Cry, and she would speak to Mr. Mayor, and I should not go to Service till I was bigger. such a frightful Thing to me, that if she had assured me I should not have gone till I was 20 Years Old, it would have been the same to me, I should have cry'd all the time, with the very Apprehension of its being to be so at last. and what would you have says she, don't I tell you that you shall not go to Service till you are bigger? Ay, says I, but then I must go at last, why, what, said she is the Girl Mad? what would you be a Gentlewoman? Yes says I, and cry'd heartily till I roar'd out again. would: Well, Madam, Forsooth, says she, Gibing at me, you would be a Gentlewoman, and how will you come to be a Gentlewoman? What will you do it by your Fingers Ends? thee? said in such a poor Petitioning Tone, that it made the poor Woman's Heart yearn to me, as she told me afterwards. must buy the little Gentlewoman Cloaths, says she, and smil'd all the while at me. Victuals. live with you. much like a Child, you may be sure, and still I cry'd heartily. was joined with so much Innocence, and so much Passion, That in short, it set the good Motherly Creature a weeping too, and at last she cry'd as fast as I did, and then took me, and lead me out of the Teaching Room; Come, says she, you shan't go to Service, you shall live with me, and this pacify'd me for the present. Nurse told Mr. Mayor the whole Tale: He was so pleased with it, that he would call his Lady, and his Two Daughters to hear it, and it made Mirth enough among them, you may be sure. and her Two Daughters to the House to see my old Nurse, and to see her School and the Children: When they had look'd about them a little: Well Mrs. ---, says the Mayoress to my Nurse; and pray which is the little Lass that is to be a Gentlewoman? I heard her, and I was terrible frighted, tho' I did not know why neither; but Mrs. Mayoress comes up to me, Well Miss, says she, And what are you at Work upon?  The Word Miss was a Language that had hardly been heard of in our School, and I wonder'd what sad Name it was she call'd me; However, I stood up, made a Court'sy, and she took my Work out of my Hand, look'd on it, and said it was very well; then she look'd upon one of my Hands, nay, she may come to be a Gentlewoman, says she, for ought I know; she has a Lady's Hand, I assure you: This pleased me mightily, but Mrs. Mayoress did not stop there, but put her Hand in her Pocket, gave me a Shilling, and bid me mind my Work, and learn to Work well, and I might be a Gentlewoman for ought she knew. them, did not understand me at all, for they meant one Sort of thing by the Word Gentlewoman, and I meant quite another: for alas, all I understood by being a Gentlewoman, was to be able to Work for my self, and get enough to keep me without going to Service, whereas they meant to live Great and High, and I know not what. call'd for the Gentlewoman too, and they talk'd a long while to me, and I answered them in my Innocent way; but always if they ask'd me whether I resolv'd to be a Gentlewoman, I answer'd, Yes: At last they ask'd me, what a Gentlewoman was? that puzzel'd me much; however, I explain'd my self negatively, that it was one that did not go to Service, to do House-Work; they were mightily pleased, and lik'd my little Prattle to them, which it seems was agreeable enough to them, and they gave me Money too. told her, she should have all I got when I was a Gentlewoman, as well as now; by this and some other of my talk, my old Tuteress began to understand what I meant by being a Gentlewoman; and that it was no more, than to be able to get my Bread by my own Work, and at last, she ask'd me whether it was not so. Gentlewoman; for, says I, there is such a one, naming a Woman that mended Lace, and wash'd the Ladies Lac'd-heads, she, says I, is a Gentlewoman, and they call her Madam. that, for she is a Person of ill Fame, and has had two Bastards. call her Madam, and she does not go to Service nor do House-Work, and therefore I insisted, that she was a Gentlewoman, and I would be such a Gentlewoman as that. it, and every now and then Mr. Mayor's Daughters would come and see me, and ask where the little Gentlewoman was, which made me not a little Proud of my self besides. I was often visited by these young Ladies, and sometimes they brought others with them; so that I was known by it, almost all over the Town. was mighty Grave, very Mannerly, and as I had often heard the Ladies say I was Prety, and would be very Handsome, you may be sure it made me not a little Proud: However, that Pride had no ill Effect upon me yet, only as they often gave me Money, and I gave it my old Nurse, she, honest Woman, was so just as to lay it out again for me, and gave me Head-Dresses, and Linnen, and Gloves, and I went very Neat, for if I had Rags on, I would always be Clean, or else I would dabble them in Water my self; but I say, my good Nurse, when I had Money given me, very honestly laid it out for me, and would always tell the Ladies this, or that, was bought with their Money; and this made them give me more, till at last, I was indeed call'd upon by the Magistrates to go out to Service; but then I was become so good a Workwoman my self, and the Ladies were so kind to me, that I was past it; for I could Earn as much for my Nurse as was enough to keep me; so she told them, that if they would give her leave, she would keep the Gentlewoman as she call'd me, to be her Assistant, and teach the Children, which I was very well able to do; for I was very nimble at my Work, tho' I was yet very young. that I was no more maintain'd by the Town as before, they gave me Money oftener; and as I grew up, they brought me Work to do for them; such as Linnen to Make, Laces to Mend, and Heads to Dress up, and not only paid me for doing them, but even taught me how to do them; so that I was a Gentlewoman indeed, as I understood that Word; for before I was Twelve Years old, I not only found my self Cloaths, and paid my Nurse for my keeping, but got Money in my Pocket too. Childrens; some Stockings, some Petticoats, some Gowns, some one thing, some another, and these my old Woman managed for me like a Mother, and kept them for me, obliged me to mend them, and turn them to the best Advantage, for she was a rare House-Wife. Home to her House, for a Month, she said, to be among her Daughters. unless she resolv'd to keep me for good and all, she would do the little Gentlewoman more harm than good; Well, says the Lady, that's true, I'll only take her Home for a Week then, that I may see how my Daughters and she agree, and how I like her Temper, and then I'll tell you more; and in the mean time, if nay Body comes to see her as they used to do, you may only tell them, you have sent her out to my House. was so pleased there with the young Ladies, and they so pleased with me, that I had enough to do to come away, and they were as unwilling to part with me. Woman, and began now to be very helpful to her; for I was almost fourteen Years old, was tall of my Age, and look'd a little Womanish; but I had such a taste of Genteel living at the Lady's House, that I was not so easy in my old Quarters as I us'd to be, and I thought it was fine to be a Gentlewoman indeed, for I had quite other Notions of a Gentlewoman now, than I had before; and as I thought that it was fine to be a Gentlewoman, so I lov'd to be among Gentlewomen, and therefore I long'd to be there again. Mother I ought to call her, fell Sick and Dy'd; I was then in a sad Condition indeed, for as there is no great Bustle in putting an End to a poor Body's Family, when once they are carried to the Grave; so the poor good Woman being Buried, the Parish Children were immediately remov'd by the Church-Wardens; the School was at an End, and the Day-Children of it had no more to do but just stay at Home, till they were sent some where else; as for what she left, a Daughter, a married Woman, came and swept it all away, and removing the Goods, they had no more to say to me than to Jest with me, and tell me, that the little Gentlewoman might set up for her self, if she pleased. as it were, turn'd out of Doors to the wide World, and that which was still worse, the old honest Woman had two and Twenty Shillings of mine in her Hand, which was all the Estate the little Gentlewoman had in the World; and when I ask'd the Daughter for it, she huft me, and told me, she had nothing to do with it. lay in such a Place, that it was the Child's Money, and had call'd once or twice for me to give it me, but I was unhappily out of the way, and when I came back she was past being in a Condition to speak of it: However, the Daughter was so Honest afterwards, as to give it me, tho' at first she us'd me Cruely about it. turn'd into the wide World; for the Daughter remov'd all the Goods, and I had not so much as a Lodging to go to, or a bit of Bread to Eat: But it seems some of the Neighbours took so much Compassion of me, as to acquaint the Lady in whose Family I had been; and immediately she sent her Maid to fetch me; and away I went with them Bag and Baggage, and with a glad Heart you may be sure: The fright of my Condition had made such an Impression upon me, that I did not want now to be a Gentlewoman, but was very willing to be a Servant, and that any kind of Servant they thought fit to have me be. generous, for she exceeded the good Woman I was with before in every Thing, as in Estate; I say, in every Thing except Honesty; and for that, tho' this was a Lady most exactly Just, yet I must not forget to say on all Occasions, that the first, tho' Poor, was as uprightly Honest as it was possible. the first Lady, that is to say, the Mayoress that was, sent her Daughters to take care of me; and another Family which had taken Notice of me when I was the little Gentlewoman, sent for me after her, so that I was mightily made of; nay, and they were not a little Angry, especially the Mayoress, that her Friend had taken me away from her; for as she said, I was hers by Right, she having been the first that took any Notice of me; but they that had me, would not part with me; and as for me I could not be better than where I was. all the Advantages for my Education, that could be imagined; the Lady had Masters home to teach her Daughters to Dance, and to speak French, and to Write, and others to teach them Musick; and as I was always with them, I learn'd as fast as they; and tho' the Masters were not appointed to teach me, yet I learn'd by Imitation and Enquiry, all that they learn'd by Instruction and Direction. So that in short, I learned to Dance, and speak French as well any of them, and to Sing much better, for I had a better Voice than any of them; I could not so readily come at playing the Harpsicord or Spinnet, because I had no Instrument of my own to Practise on, and could only come at theirs in the intervals when they left it; but yet I learned tollerably well, and the young Ladies at length got two Instruments, that is to say, a Harpsicord and a Spinnet too, and then they Taught me themselves; but as to Dancing they could hardly help my learning Country Dances, because they always wanted me to make up even Number; and on the other Hand, they were as heartily willing to learn me every thing that they had been Taught themselves, as I could be to take the Learning. I could have had, if I had been as much a Gentlewoman as they were, with whom I liv'd; and in some things I had the Advantage of my Ladies, tho' they were my Superiors, Viz. that mine were all the Gifts of Nature, and which all their Fortunes could not furnish. First, I was apparently Handsomer than any of them. Secondly, I was better shap'd, and Thirdly, I Sung better, by which I mean, I had a better Voice; in all which you will, I hope, allow me to say, I do not speak my own Conceit, but the Opinion of all that knew the Family. taken for very Handsome, or if you please for a great Beauty, I very well knew it, and had as good an Opinion of my self, as any Body else could have of me, and particularly I loved to hear any Body speak of it, which happened often, and was a great Satisfaction to me. Part of my Life, I not only had the Reputation of living in a very good Family, and a Family Noted and Respected every where for Vertue and Sobriety, and for every valluable Thing; but I had the Character too of a very sober, modest, and vertuous young Woman, and such I had always been; neither had I yet any Occasion to think of any thing else, or to know what a Temptation to Wickedness meant. Cause of it. The Lady in the House where I was, had two Sons, young Gentlemen of Extraordinary Parts and Behaviour; and it was my Misfortune to be very well with them both, but they managed themselves with me in a quite different Manner. tho' he had Levity enough to do an ill-natur'd thing, yet had too much Judgment of things to pay too dear for his Pleasures; he began with that unhappy Snare to all Women, Viz. taking Notice upon all Occasions how pretty I was, as he call'd it, how agreeable, how well Carriaged, and the like; and this he contriv'd so subtilly, as if he had known as well how to catch a Woman in his Net, as a Patridge when he went a Setting; for he would contrive to be talking this to his Sisters when tho' I was not by, yet when he knew I was not so far off, but that I should be sure to hear him: His Sisters would return softly to him, hush Brother, she will hear you, she is but in the next Room; then he would put it of, and talk softlier as if he had not known it, and begin to acknowledge he was Wrong; and then as if he had forgot himself, he would speak aloud again, and I that was so well pleased to hear it, was sure to Listen for it upon all Occasions. to lay it in my Way, he play'd an open Game; and one Day going by his Sister's Chamber when I was there, he comes in with an Air of Gaity, O! Mrs. Betty, said he to me, How do you do Mrs. Betty? don't your Cheeks burn Mr. Betty? I made a Court'sy, and blush'd, but said nothing; What makes you talk so Brother, says the Lady ; Why, says he, we have been talking of her below Stairs this half Hour; Well, says his Sister, you can say no Harm of her, that I am sure, so 'tis no matter what you have been talking about; nay, says he, 'tis so far from talking Harm of her, that we have been talking a great deal of good, and a great many fine Things have been said of Mrs Betty, I assure you; and particularly, that she is the Handsomest young Woman in Colchester, and, in short, they begin to Toast her Health in the Town. but she had as good want every Thing, for the Market is against our Sex just now; and if a young Woman has Beauty, Birth, Breeding, Wit, Sense, Manners, Modesty, and all to an Extream; yet if she has not Money, she's no Body, she had as good want them all; nothing but Money now recommends a Woman; the Men play the Game all into their own Hands. am an Exception to your Rule: I assure you, if I find a Woman so Accomplish'd as you Talk of, I won't trouble my self about the Money. O, says the Sister, but you will take Care not to Fancy one then without the Money. the Fortune? you are none of them that want a Fortune, what ever else you want. I have the Money and want the Beauty; but as Times go now, the first will do, so I have the better of my Neighbours. you; for Beauty will steal a Husband sometimes in spight of Money; and when the Maid chances to be Handsomer than the Mistress, she oftentimes makes as good a Market, and rides in a Coach before her. but that I heard all their Discourse, in which I heard abundance of fine things said of me self, which prompted my Vanity, but, as I soon found, was not the way to encrease my Interest in the Family, for the Sister and the younger Brother fell grieveously out about it; and as he said some very disobliging things to her, upon my Account, so I could easily see that she resented them, by her future Conduct to me, which indeed was very unjust; for I had never had the least thought of what she suspected, as to her younger Brother: Indeed the elder Brother in his distant remote Way had said a great many things as in Jest, which I had the Folly to believe were in Earnest, or to flatter my self with the Hopes of what I ought to have suppos'd he never intended. his Sister us'd to sit, and work as he often us'd to do; and calling to them before he came in, as was his way too, I being there alone, step'd to the Door and said, Sir, the Ladies are not here, they are walk'd down the Garden; as I step'd forward to say this, he was just got to the Door, and clasping me in his Arms, as if it had been by Chance, O! Mrs Betty, says he, are you here? that's better still, I want to speak with you, more than I do with them, and then having me in his Arms he kiss'd me three or four times. me fast, and still kiss'd me, till he was out of Breath, and sitting down, says he, dear Betty, I am in Love with you. Heart, and put me into Disorder enough: He repeated it afterwards several times, that he was in Love with me, and my Heart spoke as plain as a Voice, that I lik'd it; nay whenever he said, I am in Love with you, my Blushes plainly reply'd, wou'd you were, Sir.  However nothing else pass'd at that time; it was but a Surprize, and I soon recover'd my self.  He had stay'd longer with me, but he happen'd to look out at the Window and see his Sisters coming up the Garden, so he took his Leave, kiss'd me again, told me he was very serious, and I should hear more of him very quickly, and away he went infinitely pleas'd, and had there not been one Misfortune in it, I had been in the Right, but the Mistake lay here, that Mrs. Betty was in Earnest, and the Gentleman was not. not my self, to have such a Gentleman talk to me of being in Love with me, and of my being such a charming Creature, as he told me I was, these were things I knew not how to bear, my Vanity was elevated to the last Degree: It is true, I had my Head full of Pride, but knowing nothing of the Wickedness of the times, I had not one Thought of my Virtue about me; and had my young Master offer'd it at first Sight, he might have taken any Liberty he thought fit with me; but he did not see his Advantage, which was my Happiness for that time. in the same Posture, indeed it had more of Design in it on his Part, tho' not on my Part; it was thus, The young Ladies were gone a Visiting with their Mother; his Brother was out of Town, and as for his Father he had been at London for a Week before; he had so well watch'd me, that he knew where I was, tho' I did not so much as know that he was in the House, and he briskly comes up the Stairs, and seeing me at Work, comes into the Room to me directly, and began just as he did before, with taking me in his Arms, and kissing me for almost a quarter of an Hour together. Body in the House but the Maid below Stairs, he was it may be the ruder: In short, he began to be in Earnest with me indeed; perhaps he found me a little too easy, for I made no resistance to him while he only held me in his Arms and kiss'd me; indeed I was too well pleased with it, to resist him much. me a great while; he said, he was charm'd with me, and that he could not rest till he had told me how he was in Love with me, and if I could Love him again, and would make him happy, I should be the saving of his Life; and many such fine Things. I said little to him again, but easily discovered that I was a Fool, and that I did not in the least perceive what he meant. him; and by and by taking his Advantage, he threw me down upon the Bed, and kiss'd me there most Violently; but to give him his Due, offered no manner of Rudness to me, only kiss'd me a great while; after this he thought he had heard some Body come up Stairs, so he got off from the Bed, lifted me up, professing a great deal of Love for me, but told me it was all an honest Affection, and that he meant no ill to me, and with that put five Guineas into my Hand, and went down Stairs. began to be so elevated, that I scarce knew the Ground I stood on: I am the more particular in this, that if it comes to be read by any innocent young Body, they may learn from it to guard themselves against the Mischiefs which attend an early Knowledge of their own Beauty; if a young Woman once thinks herself Handsome, she never doubts the Truth of any Man that tells her he is in Love with her; for if she believes herself Charming enough to captivate him, 'tis natural to expect the Effects of it. and as if he had found that he had an Opportunity, and was sorry he did not take hold of it, he comes up again in about half an Hour, and falls to work with me again just as he did before, only with a little less Introduction. Mrs. Betty, said he, I fancy'd before, some Body was coming up Stairs, but it was not so; However, adds he, if they find me in the Room with you, they shan't catch me a kissing of you. I told him I did not know who should be coming up Stairs for I believ'd there was no Body in the House, but the Cook, and the other Maid, and they never came up those Stairs; well, my Dear, says he, 'Tis good to be sure however, and so he sits down and we began to talk; and now, tho' I was still on fire with his first Visit, and said little, he did as it were put Words in my Mouth, telling me how passionately he lov'd me, and that tho' he could not till he came to his Estate, yet he was resolv'd to make me happy then, and himself too; that is to say, to marry me, and abundance of such things, which I poor Fool did not understand the drift off, but acted as if there was no kind of Love, but that which tended to Matrimony; and if he had spoken of that I had no Room, as well as no Power, to have said No; but we were not come to that length yet. Kisses, threw me upon the Bed again; but then he went further with me than Decency permits me to mention, nor had it been in my Power to have deny'd him at that Moment, had he offered much more than he did. they call the last Favour, which, to do him Justice, he did not attempt; and he made that Self-denial of his a Plea for all his Fredooms with me upon other Occasions after this: When this was over, he stay'd but a little while, but he put almost a Handful of Gold in my Hand, and left me a thousand Protestations of his Passion for me, and of his loving me above all the Women in the World. very little solid Reflections: I had a most unbounded Stock of Vanity and Pride, and but a very little Stock of Virtue: I did indeed cast sometimes with my self what my young Master aim'd at, but thought of nothing but the fine Words and the Gold; whether he intended to marry me, or not, seem'd a Matter of no great Consequence to me; nor did I so much as think of making any Capitulation for my self, 'till he made a kind of formal Proposal to me, as you shall hear presently. Memento to all young Women, whose Vanity prevail over their Virtue: Nothing was ever so stupid on both Sides, had I acted as became me, and resisted as Virtue and Honour requir'd, he had either desisted his Attacks, finding no room to expect the end of his Design, or had made fair and honourable Proposals of Marriage; in which Case, whoever blam'd him, no Body could have blam'd me.  In short, if he had known me, and how easy the Trifle he aim'd at, was to be had, he would have troubled his Head no farther, but have given me four or five Guineas, and have lain with me the next time he had come at me: On the other Hand, if I had known his Thoughts, and how hard he supposed I would be to be gain'd, I might have made my own Terms, and if I had not capitulated for an immediate Marriage, I might for a Maintainance till Marriage, and might have had what I would; for he was Rich to Excess, besides what he had in Expectation; but I had wholly abandoned all such Thoughts, and was taken up only with the Pride of my Beauty, and of being belov'd by such a Gentleman; as for the Gold I spent whole Hours in loooking upon it; I told the Guineas over a Thousand times a Day: Never poor vain Creature was so wrapt up with every Part of the Story, as I was, not considering what was before me, and how near my Ruin was at the Door; and indeed I think, I rather wish'd for that Ruin, than studied to avoid it. room to any in the Family to imagine that I had the least Correspondence with him; I scarce ever look'd towards him in publice, or answer'd if he spoke to me, when but for all that, we had every now and then a little Encounter, where we had room for a Word or two, and now and then a Kiss, but no fair Opportunity for the Mischief intended; and especially considering that he made more Circumlocution, than he had occasion for, and the Work appearing Difficult to him, he really made it so. Opportunity for the Wickedness he invites to: It was one Evening that I was in the Garden, with his two younger Sisters, and himself, when he found Means to convey a Note into my Hand, by which he told me that he would to Morrow desire me publickly to go of an Errand for him, and that I should see him somewhere by the Way. all by, Mrs. Betty, I must ask a Favour of you: What's that, says the Second Sister ; nay Sister, says he, very gravely If you can't spare Mrs. Betty to Day, any other time will do ; Yes, they said, they could spare her well enough, and the Sister beg'd Pardon for asking; Well, but says the eldest Sister, you must tell Mrs. Betty what it is; if it be any private Business that we must not hear, you may call her out, there she is: Why Sister, says the Gentleman very gravely, What do you mean? I only desire her to go into the High-street, (and then he pulls out a Turn-over) to such a Shop, and then he tells them a long Story of two fine Neckcloths he had bid Money for, and he wanted to have me go and make an Errand to buy a Neck to that Turn-over that he showed, and if they would take my Money for the Neckcloths to bid a Shilling more, and haggle with them; and then he made more Errands, and so continued to have such petty Business to do, that I should be sure to stay a good while. was going to make to a Family they all knew, and where was to be such and such Gentlemen, and very formally ask'd his Sisters to go with him, and they as formally excus'd themselves, because of Company that they had Notice was to come and Visit them that Afternoon, all which by the way he had contriv'd on purpose. H---'s Coach stop'd at the Door; so he runs down, and comes up again immediately, Alas! says he aloud, There's all my Mirth spoil'd at once, Sir W--- has sent his Coach for me, and desires to speak with me. It seems this Sir W--- was a Gentleman, who liv'd about three Miles off, to whom he had spoke on purpose to lend him his Charriot for a Particular Occasion, and had appointed it to call for him, as it did, about three a Clock. to go to the other Place to make his Excuse, that was to say, he made an Excuse to send his Man away, he prepares to go into the Coach: As he was going, he stop'd a while, and speaks mightily earnestly to me about his Business, and finds an Opportunity to say very softly, Come away my dear as soon as ever you can. I said nothing, but made a Court'sy, as if I had done so to what he said in Publick; in about a Quarter of an Hour I went out too, I had no Dress, other than before, except that I had a Hood, a Mask, a Fan, and a pair of Gloves in my Pocket; so that there was not the least Suspicion in the House: He waited for me in a back Lane, which he knew I must pass by, and the Coachman knew whither to go, which was to a certain Place, call'd Mile- End, where lived a Confident of his, where we went in, and where was all the Convenience in the World to be as wicked as we pleas'd. me, he did not bring me there to betray me; that his Passion for me, would not suffer him to abuse me; that he resolved to marry me as soon as he came to his Estate; that in the mean time, if I would grant his Request, he would maintain me very Honourably, and made me a thousand Protestations of his Sincerity, and of his Affection to me; and that he would never abandon me, and, as I may say, made a thousand more Preambles than he need to have done. the Sincerity of his Love to me, after so many Protestations, But--- and there I stop'd, as if I left him to guess the rest; But what, my Dear, says he, I guess what you mean, what if you should be with Child, is not that it?  Why then, says he, I ll take care of you, and provide for you, and the Child too, and that you may see I am not in Jest, says he, here's an Earnest for you, and with that he pulls out a Silk Purse with an Hundred Guineas in it, and gave it me; and I'll give you such another, says he, every Year till I marry you. his Proposal together, so that I could not say a Word, and he easily perceiv'd it; so putting the Purse into my Bosom, I made no more Resistance to him, but let him do just what he pleas'd, and as often as he pleas'd; and thus I finish'd my own Destruction at once, for from this Day, being forsaken of my Virtue, and my Modesty, I had nothing of Value left to recommend me, either to God's Blessing, or Man's Assistance. directed me to, and was at Home before any Body thought me long; as for my Gentleman, he staid out till late at Night, and there was not the least Suspicion in the Family, either on his Account or on mine. especially at Home when his Mother and the young Ladies went Abroad a Visiting, which he watch'd so narrowly, as never to miss; knowing always before-hand when they went out, and than fail'd not to catch me all alone, and securely enough; so that we took our fill of our wicked Pleasures for near half a Year; and yet, which was the most to my Satisfaction, I was not with Child. made some mention in the beginning of the Story, falls to work with me; and he finding me alone in the Garden one Evening, begins a Story of the same Kind to me, made good honest Professions of being in Love with me; and in short, proposes Fairly and Honourably to marry me. never known to me; I resisted the Proposal with Obstinacy, and began to arm my self with Arguments: I laid before him the Inequallity of the Match, the Treatment I should meet with in the Family, the Ingratitude it would be to his good Father and Mother, who had taken me into their House upon such generous Principles, and when I was in such a low Condition; and in short, I said every thing to disswade him that I could imagine, except telling him the Truth, which wou'd indeed have put an End to it all, but that I durst not think of mentioning. me to my Shifts; for this young Gentleman as he was plain and honest, so he pretended to nothing but what was so too; and knowing his own Innocence, he was not so careful to make his having a Kindness for Mrs. Betty a Secret in the House, as his Brother was; and tho' he did not let them know that he had talk'd to me about it, yet he said enough to let his Sisters perceive he lov'd me, and his Mother saw it too, which tho' they took no Notice of to me, yet they did to him, and immediately I found their Carriage to me alter'd more than ever before. to see their Carriage was alter'd, and that it grew worse and worse every Day, 'till at last I got Information that I should in a very little while be desired to remove. provided for; and especially considering that I had Reason every Day to expect I should be with Child, and that then I should be obliged to remove without any Pretences for it. that the Kindness he had for me had got Vent in the Family; he did not charge me with it, he said, for he knew well enough which way it came out; he told me his way of Talking had been the Occasion of it, for that he did not make his Respect for me so much a Secret as he might have done, and the Reason was, that he was at a Point, that if I would consent to have him, he would tell them all openly that he lov'd me, and that he intended to marry me: That it was true, his Father and Mother might resent it, and be unkind, but he was now in a Way to live, being bred to the Law, and he did not fear Maintaining me, and that in short, as he believ'd I would not be asham'd of him, so he was resolv'd not to be ashamed of me, and that he scorn'd to be afraid to own me now, who he resolv'd to own after I was his Wife, and therefore I had nothing to do but to give him my Hand, and he would answer for all the rest. Easiness with the eldest Brother, not from any Reflection of Conscience, for I was a stranger to those things, but I could not think of being a Whore to one Brother, and a Wife to the other; it came also into my Thoughts, that the first Brother had promis'd to make me his Wife when he came to his Estate; but I presently remember'd, what I had often thought of, that he had never spoken a Word of having me for a Wife, after he had Conquer'd me for a Mistress; and indeed till now, tho' I said I thought of it often, yet it gave no Disturbance at all, for as he did not seem in the least to lessen his Affection to me, so neither did he lessen his Bounty, tho' he had the Discretion himself to desire me not to lay out a Penny in Cloaths, or to make the least show extraordinary, because it would necessarily give Jealousy in the Family since every Body knew I could come at such things no manner of ordinary Way, but by some private Friendship, which they would presently have suspected. was this, the younger Brother not only laid close Siege to me, but suffered it to be seen; he would come into his Sister's Room, and his Mother's Room, and sit down, and talk a Thousand kind Things to me, even before their Faces; so that the whole House talk'd of it, and his Mother reprov'd him for it, and their Carriage to me appeared quite altered: In short, his Mother had let fall some Speeches, as if she intended to put me out of the Family, that is in English, to turn me out of Doors. Now, I was sure this could not be a Secret to his Brother, only that he might think, as indeed no Body else yet did, that the youngest Brother had made any Proposal to me about it; but as I easily could see that it would go farther, so I saw likewise there was an absolute Necessity to speak of it to him, or that he would speak of it to me, but knew not whether I should break it to him, or let it alone till he should break it to me. seriously, and never till now, I resolv'd to tell him of it first, and it was not long before I had an Opportunity, for the very next Day his Brother went to London upon some Business, and the Family being out a Visiting, just as it happened before, and as indeed was often the Case, he came according to his Custom to spend an Hour or Two with Mrs. Betty. in my Countenance, that I was not so free and pleasant with him, as I used to be, and particularly, that I had been a Crying; he was not long before he took Notice of it, and ask'd me in very kind Terms what was the Matter, and if any thing troubled me: I would have put it off if I could, but it was not to be conceal'd; so after suffering many Importunities to draw that out of me, which I long'd as much as possible to disclose, I told him that it was true, something did trouble me, and something of such a Nature, that I could hardly conceal from him, and yet that I could not tell how to tell him of it neither; that it was a thing that not only surpriz'd me, but greatly perplext me, and that I knew not what Course to take, unless he would direct me: He told me with great Tenderness, that let it be what it would, I should not let it trouble me, for he would protect me from all the World. some secret Information of our Correspondence; for that it was easy to see that their Conduct was very much chang'd towards me, and that now it was come to pass, that they frequently found Fault with me, and sometimes fell quite out with me, tho' I never gave them the least Occasion: That whereas, I us'd always to lye with the Eldest Sister I was lately put to lye by my self, or with one of the Maids; and that I had over-heard them several times talking very unkindly about me; but that which confirm'd it all was, that one of the Servants had told me that she had heard I was to be turn'd out, and that it was not safe for the Family, that I should be any longer in the House. light of it, when he must need know, that if there was any Discovery, I was undone, and that it would hurt him, tho' not Ruin him, as it would me: I upbraided him, that he was like the rest of his Sex, that when they had the Character of a Woman at their Mercy, often times made it their Jest, and at least look'd upon it as a Trifle, and counted the Ruin of those they had had their Will of, as a thing of no Value. me, he was sorry I should have such a thought of him; that he had never given me the least Occasion for it, but had been as tender of my Reputation, as he could be of his own; that he was sure our Correspondence had been managed with so much Address, that not one Creature in the Family had so much as a Suspicion of it; that if he smil'd when I told him my Thoughts, it was at the Assurance he lately receiv'd, that our understanding one another, was not so much as guess'd at, and that when he had told me, how much Reason he had to be Easy, I should smile as he did, for he was very certain, it would give me a full Satisfaction. Satisfaction, that I am to be turn'd out of Doors; for if our Correspondence is not discover'd, I know not what else I have done to change the Faces of the whole Family to me, who formerly used me with so much Tenderness, as if I had been one of their own Children. true, but that they have the least Suspicion of the Case as it is, and as it respects you and I, is so far from being true, that they suspect my Brother Robin, and, in short, they are fully perswaded he makes Love to you: Nay, the Fool has put it into their Heads too himself, for he is continually Bantring them about it, and making a Jest of himself; I confess I think he is wrong to do so, because he cannot but see it Vexes them, and makes them unkind to you; but 'tis a Satisfaction to me, because of the Assurance it gives me, that they do not suspect me in the least, and I hope this will be, to your Satisfaction too. is this the chief Thing that troubles me, tho' I have been concern'd about that too; What is it then, says he? With which, I fell into Tears, and could say nothing to him at all: He strove to pacifie me all he could, but began at last to be very pressing upon me, to tell what it was, at last I answer'd, that I thought I ought to tell him too, and that he had some right to know it, besides, that I wanted his Direction in the Case, for I was in such Perplexity, that I knew not what Course to take, and then I related the whole Affair to him: I told him, how imprudently his Brother had manag'd himself, in making himself so Publick; for that if he had kept it a Secret, I could but have denied him Positively, without giving any Reason for it, and he would in Time have ceas'd his Sollicitations; but that he had the Vanity, first, to depend upon it that I would not deny him, and then had taken the Freedom to tell his Design to the whole House. I told him, how far I had resisted him, and how sincere and honourable his Offers were; but says I, my Case will be doubly hard; for as they carry it Ill to me now, because he desires to have me, they'll carry it worse when they shall find I have deny'd him; and they will presently say, there's something else in it, and that I am marry'd already to somebody else, or that I would never refuse a Match so much above me as this was. critical Point indeed for me to manage, and he did not see which way I should get out of it; but he would consider of it, and let me know next time we met, what Resolution he was come to about it; and in the mean time, desir'd I would not give my Consent to his Brother, nor yet give him a flat Denial, but that I would hold him in Suspence a while. him, he knew very well, I had no Consent to give; that he had ingag'd himself to marry me, and that I was thereby ingag'd to him; that he had all along told me, I was his Wife, and I look'd upon my self as effectually so, as if the Ceremony had pass'd; and that it was from his own Mouth that I did so, he having all along persuaded me to call my self his Wife. Husband, I'll be as good as a Husband to you, and do not let those things trouble you now, but let me look a little farther into this Affair, and I shall be able to say more next time we meet. Thoughtful, and that tho' he was very kind to me, and kiss'd me a thousand Times, and more I believe, and gave me Money too, yet he offer'd no more all the while we were together, which was above two Hours, and which I much wonder'd at, considering how it us'd to be, and what Opportunity we had. two Days more, before he got an Opportunity to talk with him; but then getting him by himself, he talk'd very close to him about it; and the same Evening found Means (for we had a long Conference together) to repeat all their Discourse to me, which as near as I can remember, was to the purpose following. He told him he heard strange News of him since he went, ( viz. ) that he made Love to Mrs. Betty: Well, says his Brother, a little angrily, And what then? What has any body to do with that?  Nay, says his Brother, don't be angry Robin, I don't pretend to have any thing to do with it; but I find they do concern themselves about it, and that they have used the poor Girl Ill about it, which I should take as done to my self; Who do you mean by THEY? says Robin, I mean my Mother, and the Girls, says the elder Brother. the Girl? Why then, says Robin, I will be free with you, I do Love her above all the Women in the World, and I will have her, let them say and do what they will, I believe the Girl will not deny me. rational to think I would not deny him, yet I knew in my own Conscience, I must and I saw my Ruin in my being oblig'd to do so; but I knew it was my business to Talk otherwise then, so I interrupted him in his Story thus: Ay! said I, does he think I cannot deny him? but he shall find I can deny him for all that. Well my dear, says he, but let me give you the whole Story as it went on between us, and then say what you will. She has nothing, and you may have several Ladies with good Fortunes: 'Tis no matter for that, said Robin, I Love the Girl; and I will never please my Pocket in Marrying, and not please my Fancy; and so my Dear, adds he, there is no opposing him. had not learnt it before; if the best Lord in the Land offer'd me Marriage now, I could very chearfully say NO to him. said before, he will ask you many Questions about it, and all the House will wonder what the meaning of it should be. one Clap, by telling him and them too, that I am Married already to his elder Brother. he could not hide the disorder it put him into; however, he return'd, Why tho' that may be true in some Sense, yet I suppose you are but in Jest, when you talk of giving such an Answer as that, it may not be convenient on many Accounts. out, without your Consent. against a Match, which would be apparently so much to your Advantage? Why says I, should I be at a loss? First I am not oblig'd to give them any Reason, on the other hand, I may tell them, I am Married already, and stop there, and that will be a full Stop too to him, for he can have no Reason to ask one Question after it. deny them possitively, they will be disoblig'd at you, and Suspicious besides. enough before, as I told you, and acquainted you with the Circumstances, that I might have your Advice. sure, and tho' the Advice has many Mortifications in it to me, and may at first seem Strange to you, yet all Things consider'd, I see no better way for you, than to let him go on; and if you find him hearty and in Earnest, Marry him. Death, was at the very point of sinking down out of the Chair I sat in: When giving a start, my Dear, says he aloud, What's the matter with you?  Where are you a going? and a great many such Things; and with joging and calling to me, fetch'd me a little to my self, tho' it was a good while before I fully recover'd my Senses, and was not able to speak for several Minutes. have you consider seriously of it? you may see plainly how the Family stand in this Case, and they would be stark Mad if it was my Case, as it is my Brother's, and for ought I see, it would be my Ruin and yours too. to be shaken by the dislike of the Family? Did I not always object that to you, and you made a light thing of it, as what you were above, and would not Value; and is it come to this now? Is this your Faith and Honour, your Love, and the Solidity of your Promises? not sparing of them at all; but he reply'd at last, My Dear, I have not broken one Promise with you yet; I did tell you I would Marry you when I was come to my Estate; but you see my Father is a hail healthy Man, and may live these thirty Years still, and not be Older than several are round us in the Town; and you never propos'd my Marrying you sooner, because you know it might be my Ruin; and as to the rest, I have not fail'd you in any thing. me to such a horrid stop, as leaving you, since you have not left me? Will you allow no Affection, no Love on my Side, where there has been so much on your Side? Have I made you no Returns? Have I given no Testimony of my Sincerity, and of my Passion? Are the Sacrifices I have made of Honour and Modesty to you, no Proof of my being ty'd to you in Bonds too strong to be broken? safe Station, and appear with Honour, and the Remembrance of what we have done, may be wrapt up in an eternal Silence, as if it had never happen'd; you shall always have my sincere Affection, only then it shall be Honest, and perfectly Just to my Brother, you shall be my Dear Sister, as now you are my Dear---and there he stop'd. said it; but I understand you: However, I desire you to remember the long Discourses you have had with me, and the many Hour's pains you have taken to perswade me to believe my self an honest Woman; that I was your Wife intentionally, and that it was as effectual a Marriage that had pass'd between us, as if we had been publickly Wedded by the Parson of the Parish; you know these have been your own Words to me. follows; he stood stock still for a while, and said nothing and I went on thus; you cannot, says I, without the highest injustice believe that I yielded upon all these Perswasions without a Love not to be questioned, not to be shaken again by any thing that could happen afterward: If you have such dishonourable Thoughts of me, I must ask you what Foundation have I given for such a Suggestion. been perswaded to believe that I am really your Wife, shall I now give the Lye to all those Arguments, and call my self your Whore, or Mistress, which is the same thing? And will you Transfer me to your Brother? Can you Transfer my Affection? Can you bid me cease loving you, and bid me love him? Is it in my Power think you, to make such a Change at Demand?  No Sir, said I, depend upon it 'tis impossible, and whatever the Change of your Side may be, I will ever be true; and I had much rather, since it is come that unhappy Length, be your Whore than your Brother's Wife. Discourse, and told me that he stood where he did before; that he had not been Unfaithful to me in any one Promise he had ever mad yet, but that there were so many terrible things presented themselves to his View in the Affair before me, that he had thought of the other as a Remedy, only that he thought this would not be an entire parting us, but we might love as Friends all our Days, and perhaps with more Satisfaction than we should inthe Station we were now in: That he durst say, I could not apprehend anything from him, as to betraying a Secret, which could not but be the Destruction of us both if it came out: That he had but one Question to ask of me, that could lye in the way of it, and if that Question was answer'd, he could not but think still it was the only Step I could take. As to that, I told him, he need not be concern'd about it, for I was not with Child; why then my Dear, says he, we have no time to Talk farther now; Consider of it, I cannot but be of the Opinion still, that it will be the best Course you can take; and with this, he took his Leave, and the more hastily too, his Mother and Sister's Ringing at the Gate, just at the Moment he had risen up to go. the next Day, and all the rest of the Week, but he had no Opportunity to come at me all that Week, till the Sunday after, when I being indispos'd did not go to Church, and he making some Excuse stay'd at Home. same Arguments all over again; at last, I ask'd him warmly, what Opinion he must have of my Modesty, that he could suppose, I should so much as entertain a thought of lying with two Brothers?  And assur'd him it could never be: I added, if he was to tell me that he would never see me more, than, which nothing but Death could be more Terrible, yet I could never entertain a Thought so Dishonourable to my self, and so Base to him; and therefore, I entreated him if he had one Grain of Respect or Affection left for me, that he would speak no more of it to me, or that he would pull his Sword out and Kill me. He appear'd surpriz'd at my Obstinacy, as he call'd it, told me I was unkind to my self, and unkind to him in it; that it was a Crisis unlook'd for upon us both, but that he did not see any other way to save us both from Ruin, and therefore he thought it the more Unkind; but that if he must say no more of it to me, he added with an unusual Coldness, that he did not know any thing else we had to talk of; and so he rose up to take his leave; I rose up too, as if with the same indifference, but when he came to give me as it were a parting Kiss, I burst out into such a Passion of Crying, that tho' I would have spoke, I could not, and only pressing his Hand, seem'd to give him the Adieu, but cry'd vehemently. many kind things to me, but still urg'd the necessity of what he had proposed; all the while insisting, that if I did refuse, he would notwithstanding provide for me; but letting me plainly see, that he would decline me in the main Point; nay, even as a Mistress; making it a point of Honour not to lye with the Woman, that for ought he knew, might one time or other come to be his Brother's Wife. loss of his Person, whom indeed I lov'd to Distraction; and the loss of all the Expectations I had, and which I always built my Hopes upon of having him one Day for my Husband: These things oppress'd my Mind so much, that in short, the agonies of my Mind, threw me into a high Fever, and long it was, that none in the Family expected my Life. near me, as the fear, that when I was light Headed, I should say something or other to his Prejudice; I was distress'd in my Mind also to see him, and so he was to see me, for he really lov'd me most passionately; but it could not be; there was not the least Room to desire it on one side, or other. Fever abated in three Weeks, yet it several times return'd; and the Physicians said two or three times, they could do no more for me, but that they must leave Nature and the Distemper to fight it out: After the end of five Weeks I grew better, but was so weak, so alter'd, and recover'd so slowly, that the Physicians apprehended I should go into a Consumption; and which vex'd me most, they gave their Opinion, that my Mind was oppress'd, that something troubl'd me, and in short, that I was In Love; upon this, the whole House set upon me to press me to tell, whether I was in Love or not, and with who? but as I well might, I deny'd my being in Love at all. like to put the whole Family in an Uproar, they happen'd to be all at Tabe, but the Father; as for me I was Ill, and in my Chamber: At the beginning of the Talk, the old Gentlewoman who had sent me somewhat to Eat, bid her Maid go up, and ask me if I would have any more; but the Maid brought down Word, I had not Eaten half what she had sent me already.  Alas, says the old Lady, that poor Girl: I am afraid she will never be well.  Well! says the elder Brother, How should Mrs. Betty be well, they say she is in Love? I believe nothing of it says the old Gentleman. I don't know says the eldest Sister, what to say to it, they have made such a rout about her being so Handsome, and so Charming, and I know not what, and that in her hearing too, that has turn'd the Creatures Head I believe, and who knows what possessions may follow such doings? for my Part I don't know what to make of it. Brother. Ay, and a great deal Handsomer than you Sister, says Robin, and that's your Mortification. Well, well, that is not the Question, says his Sister, the Girl is well enough, and she knows it, she need not be told of it to make her Vain. being in Love; may be she is in Love with herself, it seems my Sisters think so. her Pain. What d' ye mean by that Son? says the old Lady, how can you talk so? Why Madam, says Robin again, very honestly, do you think I'd let the poor Girl die for Love, and of one too that is so near at hand to be had. Fye Brother, says the second Sister, how can you talk so? Would you take a Creature that has not a Groat in the World? Prithee Child, says Robin, Beauty's a Portion, and good Humour with it, is a double Portion; I wish thou hadst half her Stock of both for thy Portion: So there was her Mouth stop'd. is; I wonder he has not broke his Mind to Betty, I warrant she won't say NO. They that yield when they are ask'd, says Robin, are one step before them that were never ask'd to yield, and two Steps before them that yield before they are ask'd: And that's an Answer to you Sister. and laid, things were come to that pass, that it was time the Wench, meaning me, was out of the Family; and but that she was not fit to be turn'd out, she hop'd her Father and Mother would consider of it, as soon as she could be remov'd. Robin reply'd, That was for the Master and Mistress of the Family, who were not to be taught by One, that had so little Judgment as his eldest Sister. Banter'd, but poor Betty lost Ground by it extreamly in the Family: I heard of it, and cry'd heartily, and the old Lady came up to me, some body having told her that I was so much concern'd about it: I complain'd to her, that it was very hard the Doctors should pass such a Censure upon me, for which they had no Ground; and that it was still harder, considering the Circumstances I was under in the Family; that I hop'd I had done nothing to lessen her Esteem for me, or given any occasion for the Bickering between her Sons and Daughters; and I had more need to think of a Coffin, than of being in Love, and beg'd she would not letme suffer in her Opinion for an body's Mistakes, but my own. had been such a Clamour among them, and that her younger Son talk'd after such a rattling way as he did; she desir'd I would be so Faithful to her, as to Answer her but one Question sincerely; I told her I would, and with the utmost Plainess and Sincerity: Why then the Question was, Whether there was any thing between her Son Robert and me?  I told her with all the Protestations of Sincerity that I was able to make, and as I might well do, that there was not, nor ever had been; I told her, that Mr. Robert had rattled and jested, as she knew it was his way, and that I took it always as I suppos'd he meant it, to be a wild airy way of Discourse that had no Signification in it: And assured her, that there was not the least tittle of what she understood by it between us; and that those who had Suggested it, had done me a great deal of Wrong, and Mr. Robert no Service at all. and bid me take care of my Health, and want for nothing, and so took her leave: But when she came down, she found the Brother and all his Sisters together by the Ears; they were angry even to Passion, at his upbraiding them with their being Homely, and having never had any Sweet hearts, never having been ask'd the Question, their being so forward as almost to ask first, and the like: He rallied them with Mrs. Betty; how Pretty, how good Humour'd, how she Sung better than they did, and Danc'd better and how much Handsomer she was; and in doing this, he ommitted no Ill natur'd Thing that could vex them. The old Lady came down in the height of it, and to stop it, told them the Discourse she had had with me, and how I answer'd, that there was nothing between Mr. Robert and I. us, we should be closer together than we are: I told her I Lov'd her hugely, says he, but I could never made the Jade believe I was in Earnest; I do not know how you should, says his Mother, no body in their Senses could believe you were in Earnest, to Talk so to a poor Girl, whose Circumstances you know so well. believe you were in Earnest, what must we believe about it? for you ramble so in your Discourse, that no body knows whether you are in Earnest or in Jest: But as I find the Girl by your own Confession has answer'd truly, I wish you would do so too, and tell me seriously, so that I may depend upon it; Is there any thing in it or no? Are you in Earnest or no?  Are you Distracted indeed, or are you not?  'Tis a weighty Question, I wish you would make us easy about it. any more Lyes about it, I am in Earnest, as much as a Man is, that's going to be Hang'd. If Mrs. Betty would say she Lov'd me, and that she would Marry me, I'd have her to morrow Morning fasting; and say, To have, and to hold, instead of eating my Breakfast. very mournful Tone, as one greatly concern'd at it. I hope not Madam, says Robin, no Man is lost, when a good Wife has found him. Why but Child, says the old Lady, she is a Beggar. Why then Madam, she has the more need of Charity says Robin; I'll take her off the hands of the Parish, and she and I'll Beg together. Its bad Jesting with such things, says the Mother. I don't Jest Madam, says Robin: We'll come and beg your Pardon, Madam; and your Blessing Madam, and my Father's. This is all out of the way Son, says the Mother, if you are in Earnest you are Undone. I am afraid not, says he, for I am really afraid she won't have me, after all my Sisters huffing, I believe I shall never be able to persuade her to it. no Fool, says the youngest Sister, do you think she has learn'd to say NO, any more than other People? No, Mrs. Mirth-Wit, says Robin, Mrs. Betty's no Fool, but Mrs. Betty may be engaged some other way, And what then? Nay, say the eldest Sister, we can say nothing to that, Who must it be to then? She is never out of the Doors, it must be between you. I have nothing to say to that, says Robin, I have been examined enough there's my Brother, if it must be between us, go to work with him. he concluded that Robin had discover'd something: However, he kept himself from appearing disturb'd; Prithee, says he, Don't go to sham your Stories off upon me, I tell you, I deal in no such Ware, I have nothing to say to no Mrs. Betty's in the Parish; and with that he rose up and brush'd off.  No, says the eldest Sister, I dare answer for my Brother, he knows the World better. confounded: He concluded his Brother had made a full Discovery, and he began to doubt, whether I had been concern'd in it, or not; but with all his Management, he could not bring it about to get at me; at last he was so perplex'd, that he was quite Desperate, and resolv'd he would see me whatever came of it: In order to this, he contriv'd it so, that one Day after Dinner, watching his eldest Sister, till he could see her go up Stairs, he runs after her, Hark ye Sister, say he, Where is this sick Woman? may not a Body see her? Yes, says the Sister, I believe you may, but let me go in first a little, and I'll tell you; so she run up to the Door, and gave me Notice, and presently call'd to him again: Brother, says she, you may come in if you please; so in he came, just in the same kind of Rant: Well, says he, at the Door, as he came in. Where's this sick Body that's in Love? How do ye do Mrs. Betty, I would have got up out of my Chair, but was so weak I could not for a good while; and he saw it and his Sister too, and she said, Come do not strive to stand up, my Brother desires no Ceremony, especially, now you are so Weak. No no, Mrs. Betty, Pray sit still, says he, and so sits himself down in a Chair over against me, and appear'd as if he was mighty Merry. one thing, sometimes another, on purpose to amuse her, and every now and then would turn it upon the old Story: Poor Mrs. Betty, says he, It is a sad thing to be in Love, why it has reduced you sadly; at last I spoke a little, I am glad to see you so merry, Sir, says I, but I think the Doctor might have found something better to do, than to make his Game of his Patients: If I had been Ill of no other Distemper, I know the Proverb too well to have let him come to me: What Proverb, says he? What,  'Where Love is the Case, 'The Doctor's an Ass. I think the Effect has prov'd it to be Love; for it seems the Doctor has done you little Service, you mend very slowly, they say, I doubt there's somewhat in it Mrs. Betty, I doubt you are sick of the Incurables, I smil'd and said, No, indeed Sir, that's none of my Distemper. little; by and by he ask'd me to sing them a Song; at which I smil'd, and said, my singing Days were over: At last he ask'd me, if he should Play upon his Flute to me; his Sister said she believ'd my Head could not bear it; I bow'd and said, Pray Madam do not hinder it, I love the Flute very much; then his Sister said, well do then Brother; with that he pull'd out the Key of his Closet, Dear Sister, says he, I am very Lazy, do step and fetch my Flute, it lies in such a Drawer, naming a Place where he was sure it was not, that she might be a little while a looking for it. his Brother had about me, and his concern about it, which was the Reason of his contriving this Visit.  I assured him, I had never opened my Mouth, either to his Brother, or to any Body else: I told him the dreadful Exigence I was in; that my Love to him, and his offering to have me forget that Affection, and remove it to another, had thrown me down; and that I had a Thousand times wish'd I might Dye, rather than Recover, and to have the same Circumstaces to struggle with as I had before: I added, that I foresaw, that as soon as I was well, I must quit the Family, and that as for marrying his Brother, I abhor'd the thoughts of it, after what had been my Case with him, and that he might depend upon it, I would never see his Brother again upon that Subject: That if he would break all his Vows and Oaths, and Engagements with me, be that between his Conscience and himself: But he should never be able to say, that I who he had perswaded to call my self his Wife, and who had given him the Liberty to use me as a Wife, was not as Faithful to him as a Wife ought to be, whatever he might be to me. perswaded, and was a going to say more, but he heard his Sister a coming, and so did I; and yet I forced out these few Words as a reply, That I could never be perswaded to Love one Brother, and Marry the other: He shook his Head and said, Then I am ruin'd, meaning himself; and that Moment his Sister enter'd the Room, and told him she could not find the Flute: Well says he merrily, This Laziness won't do, so he gets up and goes himself to look for it, but comes back without it too, not but that he could have found it, but he had no mind to Play; and besides, the Errand he sent his Sister on was answer'd another way; for he only wanted to speak to me, which he had done, tho' not much to his Satisfaction. in Freedom, and with such an honest Plainess, as I have related; and tho' it did not at all work the way I desired, that is to say, to oblige the Person to me the more; yet it took from him all Possibility of quitting me, but by a down right breach of Honour, and giving up all the Faith of a Gentleman which he had so often engaged by, never to abandon me, but to make me his Wife as soon as he came to his Estate. began to grow well; but I continued Melancholly and Retir'd, which amaz'd the whole Family, except he that knew the Reason of it; yet it was a great while before he took any Notice of it, and I, as backward to speak as he, carried as respectfully to him, but never offer'd to speak a Word that was Particular of any kind whatsoever; and this continued for Sixteen or Seventeen Weeks; so that as I expected every Day to be dismiss'd the Family, on Account of what Distaste they had taken another way, in which I had no Guilt, I expected to hear no more of this Gentleman, after all his solemn Vows, but to be ruin'd and abandon'd. talking seriously with the old Lady one Day, about my own Circumstances, and how my Distemper had left a Heaviness upon my Spirits: The old Lady said, I am afraid Betty, what I have said to you about my Son, has had some Influence upon you, and that you are Melancholly on his Account; Pray will you let me know how the Matter stands with you both? If it may not be improper, for as for Robin, he does nothing but Rally and Banter when I speak of it to him: Why truly Madam, said I, that Matter stands as I wish it did not, and I shall be very Sincere with you in it, whatever befalls me.  Mr. Robert has several times propos'd Marriage to me, which is what I had no Reason to expect, my poor Circumstances consider'd; but I have always resisted him, and that perhaps in Terms more possitive than became me, considering the Regard that I ought to have for every Branch of your Family: But, said I, Madam, I could never so far forget my Obligations to you, and all your House, to offer to Consent to a Thing which I knew must needs be Disobliging to you, and have possitively told him, that I would never entertain a Thought of that kind, unless I had your Consent, and his Father's also, to whom I was bound by so many invincible Obligations. much Juster to us than we have been to you; for we have all look'd upon you as a kind of a Snare to my Son; and I had a Proposal to make you, for your Removing for fear of it; but I had not yet mention'd it to you, because I was afraid of grieving you too much, least it should throw you down again, for we have a Respect for you still, tho' not so much as to have it be the Ruin of my Son; but if it be as you say, we have all wrong'd you very much. himself, if he will do me any Justice, he must tell you the Story just as I have told it. just as I had told it her, and they were surpris'd at it, you may be sure, as I believ'd they would be; one said she could never have thought it, another said Robin was a Fool; a Third said, she would not believe a Word of it, and she would warrant that Robin would tell the Story another way; but the old Lady who was resolv'd to go to the bottom of it, before I could have the least Opportunity of acquainting her Son with what had pass'd, resolv'd too, that she would talk with her Son immediately, and to that purpose sent for him, for he was gone but to a Lawyer's House in the Town, and upon her sending he returned immediately. says the old Lady, I must have some talk with you; with all my Heart, Madam, says Robin, looking very Merry, I hope it is about a good Wife, for I am at a great Loss in that Affair: How can that be, says his Mother, did not you say you resolv'd to have Mrs. Betty? Ay, Madam, says Robin, but there is one that has forbid the Banns: Forbid the Banns, who can that be? Even Mrs. Betty herself, says Robin. How so, says his Mother, have you ask'd her the Question then? Yes indeed Madam, says Robin, I have attack'd her in Form five times since she was Sick, and am beaten off; the Jade is so stout, she won't Capitulate, nor Yield upon any Terms, except such as I can't effectually grant: Explain your self, says the Mother, for I am surpris'd, I do not understand you, I hope you are not in Earnest. self; she won't have me, she says, is not that plain enough? I think 'tis plain, and pretty rough too; Well, but, says the Mother, you talk of Conditions, that you cannot grant, what does she want a Settlement? Her Joynter ought to be according to her Portion; what does she bring? Nay, as to Fortune, says Robin, she is rich enough; I am satisfied in that Point; but 'tis I that am not able to come up to her Terms, and she is possitive she will not have me without. to be serious with him, he will never give a direct Answer to any thing; you had better let him alone, and talk no more of it, you know how to dispose of her out of his way, Robin was a little warm'd with his Sister's Rudeness, but he was even with her presently, there are two sorts of People, Madam, says he, turning to his Mother, that there is no contending with, that is a wise Body and a Fool, 'tis a little hard I should engage with both of them together. Brother's Opinion, that he should make us believe, he has seriously ask'd Mrs. Betty to marry him, and she has refus'd him. Answer, and Answer not, says Solomon, reply'd her Brother: When your Brother had said that he had ask'd her no less than five Times, and that she possitively denied him, methinks a younger Sister need not question the Truth of it, when her Mother did not: My Mother you see did not understand it, says the Second Sister: Ther's some Difference, says Robin, between desiring me to explain it, and telling me she did not believe it. Mystery of it, What were these hard Conditions? Yes Madam, says Robin, I had done it before now, if the Teazers here had not worried me by way of Interruption: The Conditions are, that I bring my Father and you to Consent to it, and without that, she protests she will never see me more upon that Head; and the Conditions, as I said, I suppose I shall never be able to Grant; I hope my warm Sisters will be answer'd now, and blush a little. of what I had said to her; as to the Daughters they stood Mute a great while; but the Mother said with some Passion, Well I heard this before, but I could not believe it, but if it is so, then we have all done Betty wrong, and she had behav'd better than I expected; Nay, says the eldest Sister, if it is so, she has acted Handsomely indeed: I confess, says the Mother, it was none of her Fault, if he was enough Fool to take a Fancy to her; but to give such an Answer to him, shews more Respect to us, than I can tell how to express; I shall value the Girl the better for it, as long as I know her.  But I shall not, says Robin, unless you will give your Consent: I'll consider of that a while, says the Mother, I assure you, if there were not some other Objections, this Conduct of hers would go a great way to bring me to Consent: I wish it would go quite thro' with it, says Robin; if you had as much thought about making me easy, as you have about making me Rich, you would soon Consent to it. fain have her? Really Madam, says Robin, I think 'tis hard you should question me again upon that Head: I won't say that I will have her, how can I resolve that Point, when you see I cannot have her without your Consent; but this I will say, I am Earnest, that I will never have any Body else, if I can help it; Betty or no Body is the Word, and the Question which of the Two shall be in your Breast to decide Madam, provided only, That my good humour'd Sisters here, may have no Vote in it. press'd her Home in it: On the other hand, she advised with the Eldest Son, and he used all the Arguments in the World to perswade her to Consent; alledging his Brother's Passionate Love for me, and my generous Regard to the Family, in refusing my own Advantages upon such a nice Point of Honour, and a Thousand such Things: And as to the Father, he was a Man in a hurry of publick Affairs, and getting Money, seldom at Home, thoughtful of the main Chance, but left all those things to his Wife. broke out: It was not so Difficult, or so Dangerous, for the Elder Brother, who no Body suspected of any thing, to have a freer Access than before: Nay, the Mother, which was just as he wished, Propos'd it to him to talk with Mrs. Betty; it may be Son, said she, you may see farther into the Thing than I; and see if she has been so Possitive as Robin says she has been, or no.  This was as well as he could wish, and he as it were yielding to talk with me at his Mother's Request, she brought me to him into her own Chamber; told me her Son had some Business with me at her Request, and then she left us together, and he shut the Door after her. but told me it was now come to that Crisis, that I should make my self Happy or Miserable, as long as I liv'd: That if I could not comply to his Desire, we should be both Ruin'd: Then he told me the whole Story between Robin as he call'd him, and his Mother, and his Sisters, and himself, as above: And now dear Child, says he, consider what it will be to marry a Gentleman of a good Family, in good Circumstances, and with the Consent of the whole House, and to enjoy all that the World can give you; And what on the other hand, to be sunk into the dark Circumstances of a Woman that has lost her Reputation; and that tho' I shall be a private Friend to you while I live, yet as I shall be suspected always, so you will be afraid to see me, and I shall be afraid to own you. between us Child, so long as we both agree to do so, may be buried and forgotten: I shall always be your sincere Friend, without any Inclination to nearer Intimacy, when you become my Sister; and we shall have all the honest part of Conversation without any Reproaches between us, of having done amiss: I beg of you to consider it, and do not stand in the way of your own Safety and Prosperity; and to satisfy you that I am Sincere, added he, I here offer you Five Hundred Pounds to make you some amends for the Freedoms I have taken with you, which we shall look upon as some of the Follies of our Lives, which 'tis hoped we may repent of. express, that you may suppose as he held me above an Hour and Half in that Discourse, so he answer'd all my Objections, and fortified his Discourse with all the Arguments that humane Wit and Art could devise. me, so as to give me any thought of the Matter, till he told me at last very plainly, that if I refus'd, he was sorry to add, that he could never go on with me in that Station as we stood before; that tho' he lov'd me as well as ever, and that I was as agreeable to him; yet the Sense of Virtue had not so far forsaken him as to suffer him to lye with a Woman that his Brother courted to make his Wife; that if he took his Leave of me, with a denial from me in this Affair, whatever he might do for me in the Point of Support, grounded on his first Engagement of maintaining me, yet he would not have me be surpris'd, that he was obliged to tell me, he could not allow himself to see me any more; and that indeed I could not expect it of him. had much ado, to avoid sinking down, for indeed I lov'd him to an Extravagance, not easy to imagine; but he perceiv'd my Disorder, and entreated me to consider seriously of it, assured me that it was the only way to preserve our mutual Affection; that in this Station we might love as Friends, with the utmost Passion, and with a love of Relation untainted, free from our own just Reproaches, and free from other Peoples Suspicions: That he should ever acknowledge his happiness owing to me; that he would be Debtor to me as long as he liv'd, and would be paying that Debt as long as he had Breath: Thus he wrought me up, in short, to a kind of Hesitation in the Matter; having the Dangers on one Side represented in lively Figures, and indeed heightn'd by my Imagination of being turn'd out to the wide World, a meer Cast-off Whore, for it was no less, and perhaps expos'd as such; with little to provide for myself; with no Friend, no Acquaintance in the whole World, out of that Town, and there I could not pretend to stay; all this terrify'd me to the last Degree, and he took care upon all Occasions to lay it home to me, in the worst Colours; on the other hand, he fail'd not to set forth the easy prosperous Life, which I was going to live. Engagements, with telling me the Necessity that was before us of taking other Measures now; and as to his Promises of Marriage, the Nature of things, he said, had put an End to that, by the Probability of my being his Brother's Wife, before the time to which his Promises all referr'd. all my Arguments, and I began to see a Danger that I was in, which I had not considered of before, and that was of being drop'd by both of them, and left alone in the World to shift for my self. with so much Reluctance, that it was easy to see I should go to Church, like a Bear to the Stake; I had some little Apprehensions about me too, least my new Spouse who by the way, I had not the least Affection for, should be Skilful enough to Challenge me on another Account, upon our first coming to Bed together; but whether he did it with design or not, I know not; but his elder Brother took care to make him very much Fuddled before he went to Bed so that I had the Satisfaction of a drunken Bedfellow the first Night: How he did it I know not, but I concluded that he certainly contriv'd it, that his Brother might be able to make no Judgment of the difference between a Maid and a married Woman, nor did he ever entertain any Notions of it, or disturb his Thoughts about it. having thus managed me, his next Business was to manage his Mother, and he never left till he had brought her to acquiesce, and be passive even without acquainting the Father, other than by Post Letters: So that she consented to our Marrying privately, leaving her to manage the Father afterwards. done him, and how he had brought his Mother to Consent, which tho' True, was not indeed done to serve him, but to serve himself; but thus diligently did he cheat him, and had the Thanks of a faithful Friend for shifting off his Whore into his Brother's Arms for a Wife. So naturally do Men give up Honour and Justice, and even Christianity to secure themselves. having got his Mother's Consent, as above, came big with the News to me, and told me the whole Story of it, with a Sincerity so visible, that I must confess it griev'd me, that I must be the Instrument to abuse so honest a Gentleman; but there was no Remedy, he would have me, and I was not oblig'd to tell him, that I was his Brother's Whore, tho' I had no other way to put him off; so I came gradually into it, and behold we were married. could have happen'd more suitable to my Circumstances than that, as above, my Husband was so Fuddled when he came to Bed, that he could not remember in the Morning, whether he had had any Conversation with me or no, and I was obliged to tell him he had, tho' in reallity he had not, that I might be sure he could make no enquiry about any thing else. Particulars of the Family, or of my self, for the five Years that I liv'd with this Husband, only to observe that I had two Children by him, and that at the end of the five Years he died: He had been really a very good Husband to me, and we liv'd very agreeably together; but as he had not received much from them, and had in the little time he liv'd acquir'd no great Matters, so my Circumstances were not great, nor was I much mended by the Match: Indeed I had preserv'd the elder Brother's Bonds to me, to pay me 500 l. which he offered me for my Consent to marry his Brother; and this with what I had saved of the Money he formerly gave me, and about as much more by my Husband, left me a Widow with about 1200 l. in my Pocket. Father and Mother, and that was all they got by Mrs. Betty. I say, that I ever lov'd him as I ought to have done, or was suitable to the good Usage I had from him, for he was a tender, kind, good humour'd Man as any Woman could desire; but his Brother being so always in my Sight at least while we were in the Country, was a continual Snare to me; and I never was in Bed with my Husband, but I wish'd my self in the Arms of his Brother; and tho' his Brother never offer'd me the least Kindness that way, after our Marriage, but carried it just as a Brother ought to do; yet it was impossible for me to do so to him: In short, I committed Adultery and Incence with him every Day in my Desires, which without doubt, was as effectually Criminal. remov'd to London, were written to by the old Lady to come and be at the Wedding; my Husband went, but I pretended Indisposition, so I staid behind; for in short, I could not bear the sight of his being given to another Woman, tho' I knew I was never to have him my self. handsome, as every Body said of me, and I assure you I thought my self so, and with a tolerable Fortune in my Pocket, I put no finall Value upon my self: I was courted by several very considerable Tradesmen, and particularly very warmly by one, a Linnen-Draper, at whose House after my Husband's Death I took a Lodging, his Sister being my Acquaintance; here I had all the Liberty, and Opportunity to be Gay, and appear in Company that I could desire my Landlord's Sister being one of the Madest, Gayest things alive, and not so much Mistress of her Vertue, as I thought at first she had been: She brought me into a World of wild Company, and even brought home several Persons, such as she lik'd well enough to Gratify, to see her pretty Widow: Now as Fame and Fools make an Assembly, I was here wonderfully caress'd; and abundance of Admirers, and such as call'd themselves Lovers; but I found not one fair Proposal among them all; as for their common Design, that I understood too well to be drawn into any more Snares of that Kind: The case was alter'd with me, I had Money in my Pocket, and had nothing to say to them: I had been trick'd once by that Cheat call'd Love, but the Game was over, I was resolv'd now to be married or nothing, and to be well married or not at all. entertain'd with such, as I was also with others; but I found by just Observation, that the brightest Men came upon the dullest Errand, that is to say, the dullest, as to what I aim'd at; on the other hand, those who came with the best Proposals were the dullest and most disagreeable Part of the World: I was not averse to a Tradesman, but then I would have a Tradesman, Forsooth, that was something of a Gentleman too; that when my Husband had a mind to carry me to the Court, or to the Play, he might become a Sword, and look as like a Gentleman, as another Man; and not like one that had the mark of his Apron-strings upon his Coat, or the mark of his Hat upon his Perriwig; that should look as if he was set on to his Sword, when his Sword was put on to him, and that carried his Trade in his Countenance. call'd, a Gentleman-Tradesman, and as a just Plague upon my Folly, I was catch'd in the very Snare, which, as I might say, I laid for my self. with her Brother; yet when they came to the Point, it was it seems for a Mistress, and I kept true to this Notion, that a Woman should never be kept for a Mistress, that had Money to make her self a Wife. tho' as it prov'd. Brother, than have sold my self as I did to a Tradesman, that was Rake, Gentleman, Shop keeper, and Beggar all together. grossest Manner that ever Woman did; for my new Husband coming to a lump of Money at once, fell into such a Profusion of Expence, that all I had, and all he had would not have held it out above one Year. that, was, that I had the Pleasure of seeing a great deal of my Money spent upon my self: Come, my Dear, says he to me one Day, shall we go and take a turn into the Country for a Week? Ay my Dear, says I, Whither would you go? I care not whither, says he, but I have a mind to look like Quality for a Week, we'll go to Oxford, says he: How says I, shall we go, I am no Horse- Woman, and 'tis too far for a Coach: Too far, says he, no Place is too far for a Coach and Six: If I carry you out, you shall Travel like a Dutchess: Hum, says I, my Dear 'tis a Frolick, but if you have a mind to it I don't care? well the time was appointed, we had a Rich Coach, very good Horses, a Coachman, Postillion, and two Footmen in very good Liveries; a Gentleman on Horseback, and a Page with a Feather in his Hat upon another Horse; the Servants all call'd him my Lord, and I was her Honour, the Countess, and thus we travel'd to Oxford, and a pleasant Journey we had; for give him his due, not a Beggar alive knew better how to be a Lord than my Husband: We saw all the Rarities at Oxford, talk'd with two or three Fellows of Colleges, about putting a Nephew, that was left to his Lordship's Care to the University, and of their being his Tutors; we diverted our selves with bantering several other poor Scholars, with hopes of being at least his Lordship's Chaplain and putting on a Scarf; and thus having liv'd like Quality indeed, as to Expence; we went away for Northampton, and in a Word, in about Twelve Days ramble came Home again, to the Tune of about 93 l. Expence. valued nothing of Expence; as his History you may be sure has very little weight in it, 'tis enough to tell you, that in about two Years and a Quarter he Broke, got into a Spunging-House, being arrested in an Action too heavy for him to give Bail to, so he sent for me to come to him. was going to Wreck, and had been taking care to reserve something if I could or my self: But when he sent for me, he behav'd much better than I expected: He told me plainly, he had plaid the Fool and suffer'd himself to be surpriz'd which he might have prevented? that now he foresaw he could not stand it, and therefore he would have me go Home, and in the Night take away every thing I had in the House of any Value and secure it; and after that, he told me, that if I could get away 100 l. or 200 l. in Goods out of the Shop, I should do it, only, says he, let me know nothing of it, neither what you take, or whither you carry it, for as for me, says he, I am resolv'd to get out of this House and be gone; and if you never hear of me more, My Dear, says he, I wish you well; I am only sorry for the Injury I have done you: He said some very handsome Things to me indeed at Parting; for I told you he was a Gentleman, and that was all the Benefit I had of his being so; that he used me very handsomely, even to the last, only spent all I had, and left me to Rob the Creditors for something to subsist on. my leave of him I never saw him more; for he found means to break out of the the Bailiff's House that Night, or the next: How I knew not, for I could come at no Knowledge of any thing, more than this, that he came Home about three a Clock in the Morning, caus'd the rest of his Goods to be remov'd into the Mint, and the Shop to be shut up; and having rais'd what Money he could, he got over to France, from whence I had one or two Letters from him, and no more. Instructions as above, and I having made the best of my Time; I had no more Business back again at the House, not knowing but I might have been stop'd there by the Creditors; for a Commission of Bankrupt, being soon after lssued; they might have stop'd me by Orders from the Commissioners: But my Husband having desperately got out from the Bailiff's by letting himself down from almost the top of the House, to the top of another Building, and leaping from thence, which was almost two Stories, and which was enough indeed to have broken his Neck: He came home and got away his Goods, before the Creditors could come to Seize, that is to say, before they could get out the Commission, and be ready to send their Officers to take Possession. Gentleman, that in the first Letter he wrote me, he let me know where he had Pawn'd 20 Pieces of fine Holland for 30 l. which were worth above 90 l. and enclos'd me the Token, for the taking them up, paying the Money, which I did, and made in time above 100 l. of them, having Leisure to cut them, and sell them to private Families, as opportunity offer'd. casting things up, my Case was very much alter'd, and my Fortune much lessen'd; for including the Hollands, and a parcel of fine Muslins, which I carry'd off before, and some Plate, and other things; I found I could hardly muster up 500 l. and my Condition was very odd, for tho' I had no Child, ( I had had one by my Gentleman Draper, but it was buried, ) yet I was a Widow bewitch'd, I had a Husband, and no Husband, and I could not pretend to Marry again, though I knew well enough my Husband would never see England any more, if he liv'd fifty Years: Thus I say, I was limited from Marriage, what Offer soever might be made me; and I had not one Friend to advise with, in the Condition I was in, at least not one who I could Trust the Secret of my Circumstances to, for if the Commissioners were to have been inform'd where I was, I should have been fetch'd up, and all I had sav'd be taken away. Knowledge, and go by another Name: This I did effectually, for I went into the Mint too, took Lodgings in a very private Place, dress'd me up in the Habit of a Widow, and call'd my self Mrs. Flanders. nothing of me, yet I soon got a great deal of Company about me; and whether it be that Women are scarce among the People that generally are to be found there; or that some Consolation in the Miseries of that Place, are more requisite than on other Occasions, I soon found that an agreable Woman was exceedingly valuable among the Sons of Affliction there; and that those that cou'd not pay Half a Crown in the Pound to their Creditors, and run in Debt at the Sign of the Bull for their Dinners, would yet find Money for a Supper, if they lik'd the Woman. Mistress, that lov'd his Company, but would not admit him farther, to have the Scandal of a Whore, without the Joy; and upon this score tir'd with the Place, and with the Company too, I began to think of Removing. most perplex'd Circumstances, who were reduc'd some Degrees below being ruin'd, whose Families were Objects of their own Terror and other Peoples Charity; yet while a Penny lasted, nay, even beyond it, endeavouring to drown their Sorrow in their Wickedness; heaping up more Guilt upon themselves, labouring to forget former things, which now it was the proper time to remember, making more Work for Repentance, and Sinning on, as a Remedy for Sin past. me; there was something horrid and absurd in their way of Sinning, for it was all a force even upon themselves; they did not only act against Conscience, but against Nature, and nothing was more easy than to see how Sighs would interrupt their Songs, and paleness and anguish sit upon their Brows, in spight of the forc'd Smiles they put on; nay, sometimes it would break out at their very Mouths, when they had parted with their Money for a lewd Treat, or a wicked Embrace; I have heard them, turning about, fetch a deep Sigh, and cry what a Dog am I! Well Betty, my Dear, I'll drink thy Health tho', meaning the Honest Wife, that perhaps had not a Half Crown for herself, and three or four Children: The next Morning they were at their Penitentials again, and perhaps the poor weeping Wife comes over to him, either brings him some Account of what his Creditors are doing, and how she and the Children are turn'd out of Doors, or some other dreadful News; and this adds to his self Reproaches; but when he has thought and por'd on it till he is almost Mad, having no Principles to support him, nothing within him or above him, to Comfort him; but finding it all Darkness on every Side, he flies to the same Relief again. viz. to drink it away, debauch it away, and falling into Company of Men in just the same Condition with himself, he repeats the Crime, and thus he goes every Day one Step onward of his way to Destruction. I began to consider here very seriously what I had to do; how things stood with me, and what Course I ought to take: I knew I had no Friends no not one Friend, or Relation in the World; and that little I had left apparently wasted which when it was gone, I saw nothing but Misery and Starving was before me: Upon these Considerations, I say, and fill'd with Horror at the Place I was in, I resolv'd to be gone. Widow too like me, but in better Circumstances; her Husband had been a Captain of a Ship, and having had the Misfortune to be Cast away coming Home from the West Indies, was so reduc'd by the Loss, that tho' he had saved his Life then, it broke his Heart, and kill'd him afterwards, and his Widow being persued by the Creditors was forc'd to take Shelter in the Mint: She soon made things up with the help of Friends, and was at Liberty again; and finding that I rather was there to be conceal'd, than by any particular Prosecutions, and finding also that I agreed with her, or rather she with me in a just Abhorrence of the Place, and of the Company; she invited me to go home with her, till I could put my self in some posture of settling in the World to my Mind; withal telling me, that it was Ten to One, but some good Captain of a Ship might take a Fancy to me, and Court me, in that part of the Town where she liv'd. Year, and should have been longer, but in that interval what she propos'd to me happen'd to herself, and she marry'd very much to her Advantage; but whose Fortune soever was upon the Increase, mine seem'd to be upon the Wane, and I found nothing present, except two or three Boatswains, or such Fellows, but as for the Commanders they were generally of two Sorts.  1\. Such as having good Business, that is to say, a good Ship, resolv'd not to Marry, but with Advantage. 2\. Such as being out of Employ, wanted a Wife to help them to a Ship I mean. (1.) A Wife, who having some Money could enable them to hold a good part of a Ship themselves, so to encourage Owners to come in; Or (2.) A Wife, who if she had not Money, had Friends who were concern'd in Shiping, and so could help to put the young Man into a good Ship, and neither of these was my Case; so I look'd like one that was to lie on Hand. Things was altered, as to Matrimony, that Marriages were here the Consequences of politick Schemes, for forming Interests, carrying on Business, and that Sense, good Humour, good Behaviour, Education, Vertue, Piety or any other Qualification, whether of Body or Mind, had no power to recommend: That Money only made a Woman agreeable: That Men chose Mistresses indeed by the gust of their Affection, and it was requisite for a Whore to be Handsome, well shap'd, have a good Mein, and a graceful Behaviour; but that for a Wife, no Deformity would shock the Fancy no ill Qualities the Judgment; the Money was the thing; the Portion was neither crooked, or Monstrous, but the Money was always agreeable, whatever the Wife was. Mens side, I found the Women had lost the Privilege of saying No; that it was a Favour now for a Woman to have The Question ask'd, and if any young Lady had so much Arrogance as to Counterfeit a Negative, she never had the Opportunity of denying twice; much less of Recovering that false Step, and accepting what she had seem'd to decline: The Men had such Choice every where, that the Case of the Women was very unhappy; for they seem'd to Ply at every Door, and if the Man was by great Chance refus'd at one House, he was sure to be receiv'd at the next. out, and to go a Fortune-Hunting, as they call it, when they had really no Fortune themselves to demand it, or Merit or deserve it; and they carry'd it so high, that a Woman was scarce allow'd to enquire after the Character or Estate, of the Person that pretended to her: This, I had an Example of, in a young Lady at the next House to me, and with whom I had contracted an Intimacy; she was Courted by a young Captain, and tho' she had near 2000 l. to her Fortune, she did but enquire of some of his Neighbours about his Character, his Morals, or Substance; and he took Occasion at the next Visit to let her know, truly, that he took it very ill, and that he should not give her the Trouble of his Visits any more: I heard of it, and I had begun my Acquaintance with her, I went to see her upon it: She enter'd into a close Conversation with me about it, and unbosom'd herself very freely; I perceiv'd presently that tho' she thought herself very ill us'd, yet she had no power to resent it; that she was exceedingly piqu'd she had lost him, and particularly that another of less Fortune had gain'd him. her, that as low as I was in the World, I would have despis'd a Man that should think I ought to take him upon his own Recommendation only; also I told her, that as she had a good Fortune, she had no need to stoop to the Disaster of the Times; that it was enough, that the Men could insult us that had but little Money, but if she suffer'd such an Affront to pass upon her without resenting it, she would be render'd low-priz'd upon all Occasions, that a Woman can never want an Opportunity to be reveng'd of a Man that has us'd her ill, and that there were ways enough to humble such a Fellow as that, or else certainly Women were the most unhappy Creatures in the World. She was very well pleas'd with the Discourse, and told me seriously that she would be very glad to make him sensible of her resentment, and either to bring him on again, or have the Satisfaction of her Revenge being as publick as possible. I told her, that if she would take my Advice, I would tell her how she should obtain her Wishes in both those things; and that I would engage I would bring the Man to her Door again, and make him beg to be let in: She smil'd at that, and soon let me see, that if he came to her Door, her resentment was not so great, to let him stand long there. her, that the first thing she ought to do, was a piece of Justice to herself; namely, that whereas he had reported among the Ladies, that he had left her, and pretended to give the Advantage of the Negative to himself, she should take care to have it well spread among the Women, which she could not fail of an Opportunity to do, that she had enquired into his Circumstances, and found he was not the Man he pretended to be: Let them be told too Madam, said I, that you found that he was not the Man you expected, and that you thought it was not safe to meddle with him, that you heard he was of an ill Temper, and that he boasted how he had us'd the Women ill upon many Occasions, and that particularly he was debauch'd in his Morals, & c. The last of which indeed had some Truth in it; but I did not find that she seem'd to like him much the worse for that part. She came most readily into all this, and immediately she went to Work to find Instruments, she had very little difficulty in the Search; for telling her Story in general to a Couple of her Gossips, it was the Chat of the Tea Table all over that part of the Town, and I met with it where ever I visited: Also, as it was known that I was acquainted with the young Lady her self, my Opinion was ask'd very often, and I confirm'd it with all the necessary Aggravations, and set out his Character in the blackest Colours; and as a piece of secret Intelligence, I added, what the Gossips knew nothing of, viz. That I had heard he was in very bad Circumstances; that he was under a necessity of a Fortune to support his Interest with the Owners of the Ship he Commanded: That his own Part was not paid for, and if it was not paid quickly his Owners would put him out of the Ship, and his Chief Mate was likely to Command it, who offer'd to buy that Part which the Captain had promis'd to take. I added, for I was heartily piqu'd at the Rogue, as I call'd him, that I had heard a Rumour too, that he had a Wife alive at Plymouth, and another in the West Indies, a thing which they all knew was not very uncommon for such kind of Gentlemen. next Door, who had a Father and Mother that Govern'd both her, and her Fortune, was shut up, and her Father forbid him the House: Also in one Place more the Woman had the Courage, however strange it was, to say No; and he could try no where but he was Reproached with his Pride, and that he pretended not to give the Women leave to enquire into his Character, and the like. Women on that side the Water alarm'd, he went over to Ratcliff and got access to some of the Ladies there; but tho' the young Women there too, were according to the Fate of the Day, pretty willing to be ask'd, yet such was his ill luck, that his Character follow'd him over the Water; so that tho' he might have had Wives enough, yet it did not happen among the Women that had good Fortunes, which was what he wanted. for she got a young Gentleman, who was a Relation, to come and visit her two or three times a Week in a very fine Chariot and good Liveries, and her two Agents and I also, presently spread a Report all over, that this Gentleman came to Court her; that he was a Gentleman of a Thousand Pounds a Year, and that he was fallen in Love with her, and that she was going to her Aunt's in the City, because it was inconvenient for the Gentleman to come to her with his Coach to Rotherhith, the Streets being so narrow and difficult. was ready to hang himself; he tried all the ways possible to come at her again, and wrote the most passionate Letters to her in the World, and in short, by great Application, obtained leave to wait on her again, as he said, only to clear his Reputation. wonder'd what he took her to be, that she should admit any Man to a Treaty of so much Consequence, as that of Marriage, without enquiring into his Circumstances; that if he thought she was to be huff'd into Wedlock, and that she was in the same Circumstances which her Neighbours might be in, viz. to take up with the first good Christian that came, he was mistaken; that in a word his Character was really bad, or he was very ill beholden to his Neighbours; and that unless he could clear up some Points, in which she had justly been prejudiced, she had no more to say to him, but give him the Satisfaction of knowing, that she was not afraid to say NO, either to him, or any Man else. Moans, of his Character; his not having paid for the Part he pretended to own of the Ship he Commanded; of the Resolution of his Owners to put him out of the Command, and to put his Mate in his stead; and of the Scandal rais'd on his Morals; his having been reproach'd with such and such Women, and his having a Wife at Plymouth, and another in the West-Indies, and the like; and she ask'd him whether she had not good Reason, if these things were not clear'd up, to refuse him, and to insist upon having Satisfaction in Points so significant as they were? she began to believe that all was true, by his Disorder, tho' she knew that she had been the Raiser of these Reports herself. humble, modest, and importunate Man alive in his Courtship. or ought to bear such Treatment, and if he did not see that she did not want those who thought it worth their while to come farther to her than he did, meaning the Gentleman who she had brought to visit her by way of sham. satisfy her, as well of his Circumstances, as of his Behaviour.  He brought her undeniable Evidence of his having paid for his part of the Ship; he brought her Certificates from his Owners, that the Report of their intending to remove him from the Command of the Ship, was false and groundless; in short, he was quite the reverse of what he was before. the Affair of Marriage, upon the Supposition of there being such a Choice to be had, and of the Women being so easy, it was only owing to this, that the Women wanted Courage to maintain their Ground, and that according to my Lord Rochester  'A Woman's ne'er so ruin'd but she can 'Revenge herself on her Undoer, Man. resolv'd to have him, and that indeed having him was the main bent of her Design, yet she made his obtaining her be TOHIM the most difficult thing in the World; and this she did, not by a haughty reserv'd Carriage, but by a just Policy, playing back upon him his own Game; for as he pretended by a kind of lofty Carriage, to place himself above the occasion of a Character, she broke with him upon that Subject, and at the same time that she made him submit to all possible enquiry after his Affairs, she apparently shut the Door against his looking into her own. told him plainly, that as he knew her Circumstances, it was but just she should know his; and tho' at the same time he had only known her Circumstances by common Fame, yet he had made so many Protestations of his Passion for her, that he could ask no more but her Hand to his grand Request, and the like ramble according to the Custom of Lovers: In short, he left himself no room ask any more Questions about her Estate, and she took the Advantage of it; for she placed part of her Fortune so in Trustees, without letting him know any thing of it, that it was quite out of his Reach, and made him be very well contented with the rest. 1400 l. in Money, which she gave him, and the other, after some time, she brought to light, as a Perquisite to herself, which he was to accept as a mighty Favour, seeing though it was not to be his, it might ease him in the Article of her Particular Expences; and I must add, that by this Conduct, the Gentleman himself became not only more humble in his Applications to her to obtain her, but also was much the more an obliging Husband when he had her: I cannot but remind the Ladies how much they place themselves below the common Station of a Wife, which if I may be allow'd not to be Partial is low enough already; I say, they place themselves below their common Station, and prepare their own Mortifications, by their submitting so to be insulted by the Men before-hand, which I confess I see no Necessity of. Advantage is not so much on the other Side, as the Men think it is; and that tho' it may be true, the Men have but too much Choice among us; and that some Women may be found, who will Dishonour themselves, be Cheap, and too Easy to come at; yet if they will have Women worth having, they may find them as uncomeatable as ever; and that those that are otherwise have often such Deficiencies, when had, as rather recommend the Ladies that are difficult, than encourage the Men to go on with their easy Courtship, and expect Wives equally valuable that will come at first Call. keeping their Ground, and letting their pretended Lovers see they can Resent being slighted, and that they are not afraid of saying NO. They insult us mightily, with telling us of the Number of Women; that the Wars and the Sea, and Trade, and other Incidents have carried the Men so much away, that there is no Proportion between the Numbers of the Sexes; but I am far from granting that the Number of the Women is so great; or the Number of the Men so small; but if they will have me tell the Truth, the Disadvantage of the Women is a terrible Scandal upon the Men, and it lies here only; Namely, that the Age is so wicked, and the Sex so Debauch'd, that in short the Number of such Men, as an honest Woman ought to meddle with, is small indeed; and it is but here and there that a Man is to be found who is fit for an honest Woman to venture upon. Women ought to be the more Nice; for how do we know the just Character of the Man that makes the Offer? To say that the Woman should be the more easy on this Occasion, is to say, we should be the forwarder to venture, because of the greatness of the Danger, which is very absurd. wary, and backward by how much the hazard of being betray'd is the greater, and would the Ladies act the wary Part, they would discover every Cheat that offer'd; for, in short, the Lives of very few Men now a Days will bear a Character; and if the Ladies do but make a little Enquiry, they would soon be able to distinguish the Men, and deliver themselves: As for Women that do not think their own Safety worth their own Thought, that impatient of their present State run into Matrimony, as a Horse rushes into the Battle; I can say nothing to them but this, that they are a Sort of Ladies that are to be pray'd for among the rest of distemper'd People, and they look like People that venture their Estates in a Lottery where there is a Hundred Thousand Blanks to one Prize. herself at the first Attack, or for not accepting his Proposal without enquiring into his Person or Character; on the contrary, he must think her the weakest of all Creatures as the Rate of Men now goes: In short, he must have a very contemptible Opinion of her Capacities, that having but one Cast for her Life, shall cast that Life away at once, and make Matrimony like Death, be a Leap in the Dark. Particular, which is the same thing in which of all the Parts of Life, I think at this time we suffer most in: 'Tis nothing but lack of Courage, the fear of not being married at all, and of that frightful State of Life, call'd an old Maid. This, I say, is the Wowan's Snare; but would the Ladies once but get above that Fear, and manage rightly, they would more certainly avoid it by standing their Ground, in a Case so absolutely necessary to their Felicity, than by exposing themselves as they do; and if they did not marry so soon they would make themselves amends by marrying safer; she is always married too soon, who gets a bad Husband, and she is never married too late, who gets a good one: In a Word there is'no Woman, Deformity, or lost Reputation excepted, but if she manages well may be married safely one time or other; but if she precipitates herself, it is ten Thousand to one but she is undone. there was at this time no little Nicety.  The Circumstances I was in, made the Offer of a good Husband, the most necessary thing in the World to me; but I found soon that to be made Cheap and Easy, was not the way: It soon began to be found that the Widow had no Fortune, and to say this, was to say all that was Ill of me: Being well Bred, Handsome, Witty, Modest and Agreeable; all which I had allow'd to my Character, whether justly, or no, is not to the Purpose: I say, all these would not do without the Dross. In short, the Widow they said had no Money! a new Appearance in some other Place, and even to pass by another Name if I found Occasion. had so faithfully served in her Case with the Captain; and who was as ready to serve me in the same kind as I could desire: I made no scruple to lay my Circumstances open to her, my Stock was but low, for I had made but about 540 l. at the Close of my last Affair, and I had wasted some of that: However, I had about 460 l. left, a great many very rich Cloths, a Gold Watch, and some Jewels, tho' of no extraordinary Value, and about 30 or 40 l. left in Linnen not dispos'd of. Service I had done her in the Affair above, that she was not only a steddy Friend to me, but knowing my Circumstances, she frequently made me Presents as Money came into her Hands; such as fully amounted to a Maintainance; so that I spent none of my own; and at last she made this unhappy Proposal to me, viz. that as we had observ'd, as above, how the Men made no scruple to set themselves out as Persons meriting a Woman of Fortune of their own; it was but just to deal with them in their own way, and if it was possible to deceive the Deceiver. I would be rul'd by her I should certainly get a Husband of Fortune, without leaving him any room to Reproach me with want of my own: I told her that I would give up my self wholly to her Directions, and that I would have neither Tongue to speak, or Feet to step in that Affair, but as she should direct me; depending that she would Extricate one out of every Difficulty that she brought me into, which she said she would answer for. Relation's House of hers in the Country, where she directed me; and where she brought her Husband to visit me, and calling me Cousin, she work'd Matters so about, that her Husband and she together invited me most passionately to come to Town and with them, for they now liv'd in a quite different Place from where they were before. In the next Place she tells her Husband that I had at least 1500 l. Fortune, and that I was like to have a great deal more. was but to sit still and wait the Event, for it presently went all over the Neighbourhood that the young Widow at Captain ---'s was a Fortune, that she had at least 1500 l and perhaps a great deal more, and that the Captain said so, and if the the Captain was ask'd at any time about me, he made no scruple to affirm, tho' he knew not one Word of the Matter, other than that his Wife had told him so; and in this he thought no Harm, for he really believ'd it to be so.  With the Reputation of this Fortune, I presently found my self bless'd with Admirers enough, and that I had my Choice of Men, as they said they were, which by the way confirms what I was saying before: This being my Case, I who had a subtil Game to Play, had nothing now to do but to single out from them all, the properest Man that might be for my Purpose; that is to say, the Man who was most likely to depend upon the hear say of Fortune, and not enquire too far into the Particulars; and unless I did this, I did nothing, for my Case would not bear much Enquiry. way of courting me; I had let him run on with his Protestations that he lov'd me above all the World; that if I would make him happy, that was enough; all which I knew was upon Supposition that I was very Rich, tho' I never told him a Word of it my self. consisted my Safety, for if he baulk'd, I knew I was undone, as surely as he was undone if he took me; and if I did not make some scruple about his Fortune, it was the way to lead him to raise some about mine; and first therefore, I pretend on all Occasions to doubt his Sincerity, and told him perhaps he only courted me for my Fortune; he stop'd my Mouth in that Part, with the Thunder of his Protestations as above, but still I pretended to doubt. the Sash in my Chamber this Line,  You I Love, and you alone. I read it and ask'd him to lend me the Ring, with which I wrote under it thus,  And so in Love says every one. He takes his Ring again, and writes another Line thus,  Virtue alone is an Estate. I borrowed it again and I wrote under it,  But Money's Virtue, Gold is Fate. He colour'd as red as Fire to see me turn so quick upon him, and in a kind of Rage told me he would Conquer me, and wrote again thus,  I scorn your Gold, and yet I Love, I ventur'd all upon the last cast of Poetry, as you'll see, for I wrote boldly under his last.  I'm Poor: Let's see how kind you'll prove. This was a sad Truth to me, whether he believ'd me or no I could not tell; I supposed then that he did not. However he flew to me, took me in his Arms, and kissing me very eagerly, and with the greatest Passion imaginable, he held me fast till he call'd for a Pen and Ink, and told me, he could not wait the tedious writing on a Glass, but pulling out a piece of Paper he began and wrote again,  Be mine with all your Poverty. I took his Pen and follow'd immediately thus,  Yet secretly you hope I Lye. He told me that was unkind, because it was not just, and that I put him upon contradicting me, which did not consist with good Manners, and therefore since I had insensibly drawn him into this Poetical scribble, he beg'd I would not oblige him to break it off, so he writes again,  Let Love alone be our Debate. I wrote again,  She loves enough that does not hate. This he took for a favour, and so laid down the Cudgels, that is to say the Pen; I say, he took it for a Favour, and a mighty one it was, if he had known all: However he took it as I meant it, that is, to let him think I was inclin'd to go on with him, as indeed I had Reason to do, for he was the best humour'd merry sort of a Fellow that I ever met with; and I often reflected how doubly criminal it was to deceive such a Man; but that Necessity, which press'd me to a Settlement suitable to my Condition, was my Authority for it, and certainly his Affection to me, and the Goodness of his Temper, however they might argue against using him ill, yet they strongly argued to me, that he would better take the Disappointment, than some fiery temper'd Wretch, who might have nothing to recommend him but those Passions which would serve only to make a Woman miserable. Poverty, yet when he found it to be true, he had fore closed all manner of Objection, seeing whether he was in jest or in earnest, he had declar'd he took me without any Regard to my Portion, and whether I was in jest or in earnest, I had declar'd my self to be very Poor, so that in a Word, I had him fast both ways; and tho' he might say afterwards he was cheated, yet he could never say that I had cheated him. losing him, I play'd the indifferent Part with him longer than Prudence might otherwise have dictated to me: But I consider'd how much this Caution and Indifference would give me the Advantage over him, when I should come to own my Circumstances to him; and I managed it the more warily, because I found he infer'd from thence, that I either had the more Money, or the more Judgment, and would not venture at all. the Compliment of a Lover from him, namely, that he would take me without enquiring into my Fortune, and I would make him a suitable Return in this, viz. that I would make as little enquiry into his as consisted with Reason, but I hoped he would allow me to ask some Questions, which he should answer or not as he thought fit; one of these Questions related to our manner of Living, and the Place where, because I had heard he had a great Plantation in Virginia, and I told him I did not care to be Transported. and to tell me in a frank open way, all his Circumstances, by which I found he was very well to pass in the World; but that great part of his Estate consisted of three Plantations, which he had in Virginia, which brought him in a very good Income of about 300 l. a Year; but that if he was to live upon them, would bring him in four times as much; very well, thought I, you shall carry me thither then as soon as you please, tho' I won't tell you so before hand. found he would do any thing I desired, so I turn'd my Tale; I told him I had good Reason not to desire to go there to live, because if his Plantations were worth so much there, I had not a Fortune suitable to a Gentleman of 1200 l. a Year as he said his Estate would be. beginning he would not, and he would be as good as his Word; but whatever it was, he assured me he would never desire me to go to Virginia with him, or go thither himself without me, unless I made it my Choice. happen'd more perfectly agreeable; I carried it on as far as this with a sort of Indifferency, that he often wonder'd at, and I mention it the rather to intimate again to the Ladies that nothing but want of Courage for such an Indifferency, makes our Sex so cheap, and prepares them to be ill us'd as they are; would they venture the Loss of a pretending Fop now and then who carries it high upon the point of his own Merit, they would certainly be slighted less, and courted more; had I discovered really what my great Fortune was, and that in all I had not full 500 l. when he expected 1500 l. yet I book'd him so fast, and play'd him so long that I was satisfied he would have had me in my worst Circumstances; and indeed it was less a Surprize to him when he learnt the Truth than it would have been, because having not the least Blame to lay on me, who had carried it with an Air of Indifference to the last, he could not say one Word, except that indeed he thought it had been more but that if it had been less, he did not repent his Bargain; only that he should not be able to maintain me so well as he intended, you, as to the Man; for he was the best humour'd Man that ever Woman had but his Cirstumstances were not so good as I imagined, as on the other hand he had not better'd himself so much as he expected. Stock I had, and to let him see it was no more; but there was a Necessity for it, so I took my Opportunity one Day when we were alone, to enter into a short Dialogue with him about it. My Dear, said I, we have been married a Fortnight, is it not time to let you know whether you have got a Wife with something or with nothing? Your own time for that my Dear, says he, I am satisfied I have got the Wife I love; I have not troubled you much, says he, with my Enquiry after it. scarce know how to mannage. What's that my Dear, says he?  Why, says I, 'tis a little hard upon me, and 'tis harder upon you; I am told that Captain ---, (meaning my Friend's Husband) has told you I had a great deal more than ever I pretended to have, and I am sure I never employ'd him to do so. have not so much, that may lye at his Door, but you never told me what you had, so I have no Reason to blame you if you have nothing at all. little a double Afflicton to me. your Affliction is not caus'd for fear I should be unkind to you, for want of a Portion; No, no, if you have nothing tell me plainly, I may perhaps tell the Captain he has cheated me, but I can never say you have, for did not you give it under your Hand that you was Poor, and so I ought to expect you to be. you before Marriage, if I deceive you since, 'tis ne'er the worse; that I am Poor, 'tis too true, but not so Poor as to have nothing neither; so I pull'd out some Bank Bills, and gave him about a Hundred and Sixty Pounds, there is something my Dear, says I, and not quite all neither. that the Money, tho' the Sum was small in it self, was doubly welcome; he own'd it was more than he look'd for, and that he did not question by my Discouse to him, but that my fine Cloaths, Gold Watch, and a Diamond Ring or two had been all my Fortune. having been abroad that Day and as if I had been to fetch it, I brought him a Hundred Pounds more home in Gold, and told him there was a little more Portion for him; and in short, in about a Week more I brought him 180 l. more, and about 60 l. in Linnen, which I made him believe I had been obliged to take with the 100 l. which I gave him in Gold, as a Composition for a Debt of 600 l. being little more than five Shillings in the Pound, and over-valued too. have given you my whole Fortune; I added, that if the Person who had my 600 l. had not abus'd me, I had been worth a Thousand Pound to him, but that as it was, I had been faithful, and reserv'd nothing to my self, but if it had been more he should have had it. been in a terrible Fright least it had been nothing at all, that he accepted it very thankfully: And thus I got over the Fraud of passing for a Fortune without Money, and cheating a Man into Marrying me on pretence of it; which, by the way, I take to be one of the most dangerous Steps a Woman can take, and in which she runs the most hazzards of being ill used afterwards. was no Fool; and finding his Income not suited to the manner of Living which he had intended, if I had brought him what he expected, and being under a Disappointment in his return of his Plantations in Virginia, he discovered many times his Inclination of going over to Virginia, to live upon his own; and often would be magnifying the way of living there, how Cheap, how Plentiful, how Pleasant, and the like. plainly one Morning, and told him that I did so; that I found his Estate turn'd to no Account at this Distance, compar'd to what it would do if he liv'd upon the Spot, and that I found he had a mind to go and live there; that I was sensible he had been disappointed in a Wife, and that finding his Expectations not answered that way, I could do no less, to make him amends, than tell him, that I was very willing to go to Virginia with him and live there. Proposal to him: He told me that tho' he was disappointed in his Expectations of a Fortune, he was not disappointed in a Wife, and that I was all to him that a Wife could be, but that this Offer was so kind, that is was more than he could express. good House there well furnish'd, that his Mother liv'd in it, and one Sister, which was all the Relations he had; that as soon as he came there, they would remove to another House which was her own for Life, and his after her Decease; so that I should have all the House to my self; and I found it all exactly as he said. Furniture for our House, with Stores of Linnen and other Necessaries, and a good Cargoe for Sale, and away we went. Dangers, is out of my way, I kept no Journal, neither did my Husband; all that I can say is, that after a terrible Passage, frighted twice with dreadful Storms, and once with what was still more terrible, I mean, a Pyrate, who came on board and took away almost all our Provivisions; and, which would have been beyond all to me, they had once taken my Husband, but by Intreaties were prevail'd with to leave him: I say, after all these terrible Things, we arriv'd in York River in Virginia and coming to our Plantation, we were received with all the Tenderness and Affection (by my Husband's Mother) that could be express'd. in the House, for she was too kind a Mother to be parted with; my Husband likewise continued the same at first, and I thought my self the happiest Creature alive; when an odd and surprizing Event put an end to all that Felicity in a Moment, and rendred my Condition the most uncomfortable in the World. so, for her Son was above Thirty: I say, she was very pleasant good Company and us'd to entertain me in Particular, with abundance of Stories to divert me, as well of the Country we were in as of the People. of that Colony came thither in very indifferent Cirumstances from England; that, generally speaking, they were of two Sorts, either (1.) such as were brought over by Masters of Ships to be sold as Servants; or (2.) such as are Transported after having been found guilty of Crimes punishable with Death. them, and they work together in the Field till their time is out; when 'tis expir'd, said she, they have Encouragement given them to Plant for themselves; for they have a certain Number of Acres of Land allotted them by the Country, and they go to work to clear and cure the Land and then to Plant it with Tobacco and Corn for their own Use; and as the Merchants will trust them with Tools, and Necessaries, upon the Credit of their Crop before it is grown, so they again Plant every Year a little more than the Year before, and so buy whatever they want with the Crop that is before them.  Hence Child, says she, many a Newgate-Bird becomes a great Man, and we have, continued she, several Justices of the Peace, Officers of the Train'd Bands and Magistrates of the Towns they live in, that have been burnt in the Hand. interruped her, and with a great deal of good humour'd Confidence she told me, she was one of the second sort of Inhabitants herself; that she came away openly having ventur'd too far in a Particular Case, so that she was become a Criminal, and here's the Mark of it Child says she, and shewed me a very fine white Arm and Hand, but branded in the in-side of the Hand, as in such Cases it must be. not think such a thing strange, Daughter, for some of the best Men in the Country are burnt in the Hand, and they are not asham'd to own it; there's Major ---, says she, he was an Eminent Pick pocket; there's Justice Ba--- r, was a Shoplifter, and both of them were burnt in the Hand, and I could name you several such as they are. gave me of the like, after some time as she was telling some Stories of one that was Transported but a few Weeks ago, I began in an intimate kind of way, to ask her to tell me something of her own Story, which she did with the utmost Plainness and Sincerity; how she had fallen into very ill Company in London in her young Days, oocasion'd by her Mother sending her frequently to carry Victuals to a Kinswoman of hers who was a Prisoner in Newgate, in a miserable starving Condition, who was afterwards Condemn'd to dye, but having got Respit by pleading her Belly, perish'd afterwards in the Prison. that dreadful Place, and Child, says my Mother, perhaps you may know little of it, or it may be have heard nothing about it; but depend upon it, says she, we all know here, that there are more Thieves and Rogues made by that one Prison of Newgate, than by all the Clubs and Societies of Villains in the Nation, 'tis that cursed Place, says my Mother, that half Peoples this Colony. Manner, that I began to be very uneasy, but coming to one Particular that requir'd telling her Name I thought I should have sunk down in the Place; she perceiv'd I was out of order, and ask'd me if I was not well and what ail'd me? I told her I was so affected with the melancholly Story she had told, that it had overcome me, and I beg'd of her to talk no more of it: Why my Dear, says she very kindly, what need these things trouble you? These Passages were long before your time, and they give me no Trouble at all now, nay, I look back on them with a Particular Satisfaction, as they have been a Means to bring me to this Place? Then she went on to tell me how she fell into a good Family, where behaving herself well, and her Mistress dying, her Master married her by whom she had my Husband and his Sister, and that by her Diligence and good Management after her Husband's Death, she had improved the Plantations to such a degree as they then were, so that most of the Estate was of her getting, not of her Husband's, for she had been a Widow upwards of Sixteen Years. much to retire and give vent to my Passions, and let any one judge what must be the Anguish of my Mind, when I came to reflect, that this was certainly no more or less than my own Mother, and that I had now had two Children, and was big with another by my own Brother, and lay with him still every Night. never been told me, all had been well; it had been no Crime to have lain with my Husband, if I had known nothing of it. reveal it, I could not find would be to any Purpose, and yet to conceal it would be next to impossible; nay, I did not doubt but I should talk in my Sleep, and tell my Husband of it whether I would or no: If I discover'd it, the least thing I could expect was to lose my Husband, for he was too nice and too honest a Man to have continu'd my Husband after he had known I had been his Sister, so that I was perplex'd to the last Degree. was away from my Native Country at a Distance prodigious, and the return to me unpassable; I liv'd very well, but in a Circumstance unsufferable in itself; if I had discover'd my self to my Mother, it might be difficult to convince her of the Particulars, and I had no way to prove them: On the otherhand, if she had question'd or doubted me, I had been undone, for the bare Suggestion would have immediately separated me from my Husband, without gaining my Mother or him, so that between the Surprize on one hand, and the Uncertainty on the other, I had been sure to be undone. open avowed Incest and Whoredom, and all under the appearance of an honest Wife; and tho' I was not much touched with the Crime of it, yet the Action had something in it shocking to Nature and made my Husband even nauseous to me. However, upon the most sedate Consideration, I resolv'd, that it was absolutely necessary to conceal it all, and not make the least Discovery of it either to Mother or Husband; and thus I liv'd with the greatest Pressure imaginable for three Years more. her former Adventures which however were no ways pleasant to me; for by it tho' she did not tell it me in plain Terms yet I could understand, joyn'd with what I heard my self, of my first Tutors that in her younger Days she had been Whore and Thief; but I verily believe she had liv'd to repent sincerly of both, and that she was then a very Pious, Sober and Religious Woman. life was very uneasy to me; for I liv'd, as I have said, but in the worst sort of Whoredom, and as I could expect no good of it, so really no good Issue came of it, and all my seeming Prosperity wore off and ended in Misery and Destruction. It was some time indeed before it came to this, for every thing went wrong with us afterwards, and that which was worse, my Husband grew strangely alter'd, forward, jealous and unkind, and I was as impatient of bearing his Carriage, as the Carriage was unreasonable and unjust: These things proceeded so far, and we came at last to be in such ill Terms with one another that I claim'd a Promise of him which he enter'd willingly into with me, when I consented to come from England with him, viz. that if I did not like to live there, I should come away to England again when I pleas'd, giving him a Year's warning to settle his Affairs. I say, I now claim'd this Promise of him, and I must confess I did it not in the most obliging Terms that could be neither; but I insisted that he treated me ill, that I was remote from my Friends, and could do my self no Justice, and that he was Jealous without Cause, my Conversation having been unblameable, and he having no Pretence for it, and that to remove to England, would take away all Occasion from him. Point, either to keep his Word with me, or to break it; and this, notwithstanding he used all the Skill he was Master of, and employ'd his Mother and other Agents to prevail with me to alter my Resolutions; indeed the bottom of the thing lay at my Heart, and that made all his Endeavours fruitless, for my Heart was alienated from him. I loath'd the Thoughts of Bedding with him, and used a Thousand Pretences of Illness and Humour to prevent his touching me, fearing nothing more than to be with Child again, which to be sure would have prevented, or at least delay'd my going over to England. fatal Resolution, that in short I should not go to England; that tho' he had promis'd me, yet it was an unreasonable thing, that it would be ruinous to his Affairs, would unhinge his whole Family, and be next to an Undoing him in the World; that therefore I ought not to desire it of him, and that no Wife in the World that valued her Family and her Husband's Prosperity, would insist upon such a thing. Husband as he really was, a diligent careful Man, in the main, and that he knew nothing of the dreadful Circumstances that he was in, I could not but confess to myself, that my Proposal was very unreasonable, and what no Wife that had the good of her Family at Heart wou'd have desir'd. a Husband, but as a near Relation, the Son of my own Mother, and I resolv'd some how or other to be clear of him, but which way I did not know. thing, it is impossible to turn us from our Resolutions: In short, I never ceas'd poring upon the Means to bring to pass my Voyage, and came that length with my Husband at last, as to propose going without him: This provok'd him to the last degree, and he call'd me not only an unkind Wife, but an unnatural Mother and ask'd me how I could entertain such a Thought without Horror, as that of leaving my two Children (for one was dead) without a Mother, and never to see them more. It was true, had things been right, I should not have done it, but now, it was my real desire never to see them, or him either any more; and as to the Charge of unnatural I could easily answer it to my self, while I knew that the whole Relation was unnatural in the highest degree. go with me, or let me go without him, and it was out of my Power to stir without his Consent, as any one that is acquainted with the Constitution of that Country knows very well. dangerous Height, for as I was quite estrang'd from him in Affection, so I took no heed to my Words, but sometimes gave him Language that was provoking: In short, I strove all I could to bring him to a parting with me, which was what above all things I desir'd most. I refus'd to Bed with him, and carrying on the Breach upon all occasions to extremity, he told me once he thought I was Mad, and if I did not alter my Conduct, he would put me under Cure; that is to say, into a Mad house: I told him he should find I was far enough from Mad, and that it was not in his power, or any other Villians to Murther me; I confess at the same time I was heartily frighted at his Thoughts of putting me into a Mad- House, which would at once have destroy'd all the possibility of bringing the Truth out; for that then, no one would have given Credit to a word of it. open my whole Case; but which way to do it, or to whom, was an inextricable Difficulty; when another Quarrel with my Husband happen'd, which came up to such an Extream as almost push'd me on to tell it him all to his Face; but tho' I kept it in so as not to come to the particulars, I spoke so much as put him into the utmost Confusion, and in the End brought out the whole Story. England; I defended it, and one hard Word bringing on another, as is usual in all Family Strife, he told me, I did not treat him as if he was my Husband, or talk of my Children, as if I was a Mother; and in short, that I did not deserve to be us'd as a Wife: That he had us'd all the fair Means possible with me; that he had argu'd with all the kindness and calmness, that a Husband or a Christian ought to do, and that I made him such a vile return, that I treated him rather like a Dog than a Man, and rather like the most contemptible Stranger than a Husband: That he was very loth to use Violence with me, but that, in short, he saw a Necessity of it now, and that for the future he should be oblig'd to take such Measures as should reduce me to my Duty. provok'd; I told him for his fair means and his foul they were equally contemn'd by me; that for my going to England, I was resolv'd on it, come what would; and that as to treating him not like a Husband, and not showing my self a Mother to my Children, there might be something more in it than he understood at present but I thought fit to tell him thus much, that he neither was my lawful Husband, nor they lawful Children, and that I had reason to regard neither of them more than I did. Death, and stood mute as one Thunder struck, and once or twice I thought he would have fainted; in short, it put him in a Fit something like an Apoplex; he trembl'd, a Sweat or Dew ran off his Face, and yet he was cold as a Clod, so that I was forced to fetch something to keep Life in him; when he recover'd of that, he grew sick and vomited, and in a little after was put to Bed, and the next Morning was in a violent Fever. came to be a little better, he told me, I had given him a mortal Wound with my Tongue, and he had only one thing to ask before he desir'd an Explanation; I interrupted him, and told him I was sorry I had gone so far, since I saw what disorder it put him into, but I desir'd him not to talk to me of Explanations, for that would but make things worse. bearing; for now he began to suspect that there was some Mystery yet unfolded, but could not make the least guess at it; all that run in his Brain was, that I had another Husband alive, but I assur'd him, there was not the least of that in it; indeed as to my other Husband he was effectually dead to me, and had told me I should look on him as such, so I had not the least uneasiness on that score. Husband himself gave me an Opportunity to ease my self of the Secret much to my Satisfaction; he had laboured with me three or four Weeks, but to no purpose, only to tell him, whether I had spoken those Words only to put him in a Passion, or whether there was any thing of Truth in the bottom of them: But I continued inflexible, and would explain nothing, unless he would first consent to my going to England, which he would never do, he said, while he liv'd; on the other hand I said it was in my power to make him willing when I pleas'd, Nay, to make him entreat me to go; and this increas'd his Curiosity, and made him importunate to the highest Degree. get it out of me, and she us'd her utmost Skill indeed; but I put her to a full stop at once, by telling her that the Mystery of the whole, Matter lay in herself; that it was my Respect to her had made me conceal it, and that, in short, I could go no farther, and therefore conjur'd her not to insist upon it. to think; but laying aside the Supposition as a Policy of mine, continued her Importunity on account of her Son, and if possible to make up the Breach between us two; as to that, I told her, that it was indeed a good Design in her, but that it was impossible to be done; and that if I should reveal to her the Truth of what she desir'd she would grant it to be impossible, and cease to desire it: At last I seem'd to be prevail'd on by her Importunity, and told her I dare trust her with a Secret of the greatest Importance, and she would soon see that this was so, and that I would consent to lodge it in her Breast, if she would engage solemnly not to acquaint her Son with it without my Consent. Secret she agreed to that too, and after a great many other Preliminaries, I began and told her the whole Story: First I told her how much she was concern'd in all the unhappy Breach which had happen'd between her Son and me, by telling me her own Story, and her London Name; and that the Surprize she see I was in, was upon that Occasion: Then I told her my own Story and my Name, and assur'd her by such other Tokens, as she could not deny, that I was no other, nor more or less than her own Child her Daughter born of her Body in Newgate; the same that had sav'd her from the Gallows by being in her Belly, and that she left in such and such Hands when she was Transported. inclin'd to believe the Story, or to remember the Particulars; for she immediately foresaw the Confusion that must follow in the Family upon it; but every thing concurr'd so exactly with the Stories she had told me of her self, and which, if she had not told me, she would perhaps have been content to have denied, that she had stop'd her own Mouth, and she had nothing to do but take me about the Neck and kiss me, and cry most vehemently over me, without speaking one word for a long time together; at last she broke out, Unhappy Child! says she, What miserable Chance could bring thee hither? and in the Arms of my Son too! Dreadful Girl! says she; why we are all undone! Married to thy own Brother! Three Children, and two alive, all of the same Flesh and Blood! MySon and my Daughter lying together as Husband and Wife! All Confusion and Distraction, miserable Family! What will become of us? What is to be said? What is to be done? And thus she run on a great while, nor had I any Power to speak, or if I had, did I know what to say, for every Word wounded me to the Soul: With this kind of Amazement we parted for the first time, tho' my Mother was more surpriz'd than I was, because it was more News to her than to me: However, she promis'd again, that she could say nothing of it to her Son, till we had talk'd of it again. the same Subject; when, as if she had been willing to forget the Story she had told me of herself, or to suppose that I had forgot some of the Particulars, she began to tell them with Alterations and Omissions; but I refresh'd her Memory, in many things which I supposed she had forgot and then came in so opportunely with the whole History, that it was impossible for her to go from it; and then she fell into her Rhapsodies again, and Exclamations at the Severity of her Misfortunes: When these things were a little over with her, we fell into a close Debate about what should be first done before we gave an account of the matter to my Husband, But to what purpose could be all our Consultations? we could neither of us see our way thro' it, or how it could be safe to open such a Scene to him; it was impossiblen to make any judgment, or give any guess at what Temper he would receive it in, or what Measure he would take upon it; and if he should have so little Government of himself, as to make it publick, we easily foresaw that it would be the ruin of the whole Family, and if at last he should take the Advantage the Law would give him, he might put me away with Disdain, and leave me to sue for the little Portion that I had, and perhaps waste it all in the Suit, and then be a Beggar; and thus I, should see him perhaps in the Arms of another Wife in a few Months, and be my self the most miserable Creature alive. what to do; after some time, we came to more sober Resolutions, but then it was with this Misfortune too, that my Mother's Opinion and mine were quite differen t from one another, and indeed inconsistent with one another; for my Mother's Opinion was, that I should bury the whole thing entirely, and continue to live with him as my Husband, till some other Event should make the Discovery of it more convenient; and that in the mean time she would endeavour to reconcile us together again, and restore our mutual Comfort and Family Peace; that we might lie as we us'd to do together, and so let the whole matter remain a Secret as close as Death; for Child, says she, we are both undone if it comes out. and to leave me what she could at her Death, secur'd for me separately from my Husband, so that if it should come out afterwards, I should be able to stand on my own Feet, and procure Justice too from him. kind in my Mother, but my Thoughts run quite another way. it was, I told her it was impossible; and I ask'd her how she could think I cou'd bear the Thoughts of lying with my own Brother? In the next place I told her, that her being alive was the only support of the Discovery, and that while she own'd me for her Child, and saw reason to be satisfied that I was so, no body else would doubt it; but that if she should die before the Discovery, I should be taken for an impudent Creature that had forg'd such a thing to go away from my Husband, or should be counted Craz'd and Distracted: Then I told her how he had threaten'd already to put me into a Mad-house, and what Concern I had been in about it, and how that was the thing that drove me to the Necessity of discovering it to her as I had done. was able to make in the Case, come to this Resolution, which I hop'd she would like, as a Medium between both, viz. That she should use her endeavours with her Son to give me leave to go for England, as I had desired, and to furnish me with a sufficient Sum of Money, either in Goods along with me, or in Bills for my Support there, all along suggesting, that he might one time or other think it proper to come over to me. him gradually, and as her own Discretion should guide; so that he might not be surpriz'd with it, and fly out into any Passions and Excesses; and that she should concern herself to prevent his slighting the Children, or marrying again, unless he had a certain account of my being Dead. him in the Consequence of these Things; indeed I mortally hated him as a Husband, and it was impossible to remove that riveted Aversion I had to him; at the same time, it being an unlawful incestuous Living, added to that Aversion, and every thing added to make Cohabiting with him the most nauseous thing to me in the World; and I think verily it was come to such a height, that I could almost as willingly have embrac'd a Dog, as have let him offer any thing of that kind to me, for which Reason I could not bear the Thoughts of coming between the Sheets with him; I cannot say that I was right in carrying it such a length, while at the same time I did not resolve to discover the thing to him; but I am giving an account of what was, not of what ought or ought not to be. a long time, and it was impossible to reconcile our Judgments; many Disputes we had about it, but we could never either of us yield our own, or bring over the other. upon its being impossible to bring him to consent to my going to England; and in this uncertainty we continued, not differing so as to quarrel or any thing like it; but so as not to be able to resolve what we should do to make up that terrible Breach. Resolution, viz. That in short, I would tell him of it my self; my Mother was frighted to the last degree at the very Thoughts of it; but I bid her be easy, told her I would do it gradually and softly, and with all the Art and good Humour I was Mistress of, and time it also as well as I could taking him in good Humour too: I told her, I did not question but if I cou'd be Hypocrite enough to feign more Affection to him than I really had. I should succeed in all my Design, and we might part by Consent, and with a good Agreement, for I might love him well enough for a Brother tho' I could not for a Husband. meaning of that dreadful Expression of mine, as he call'd it, which I mention'd before; namely, That I was not his lawful Wife nor my Children his legal Children: My Mother put him off, told him she could bring me to no Explanations, but found there was something that disturb'd me very much, and she hop'd she should get it out of me in time, and in the mean time recommended to him earnestly to use me more tenderly, and win me with his usual good Carriage; told him of his terrifying and affrighting me with his Threats of sending me to a Mad-house, and the like, and advis'd him not to make a Woman Desperate on any account whatever. lov'd me as well as ever and that he had no such design as that of sending me to a Mad-house, whatever he might say in his passion; also he desir'd my Mother to use the same Perswasions to me too, and we might live together as we us'd to do. immediately alter'd, and he was quite another Man to me; nothing could be kinder and more obliging than he was to me upon all Occasions; and I could do no less than make some return to it, which I did as well as I could, but it was but in an awkard manner at best, for no thing was more frightful to me than his Caresses, and the Apprehensions of being with Child again by him, was ready to throw me into Fits; and this made me see that there was an absolute necessity of breaking the Case to him without any more delay, which however I did with all the Caution and Reserve imaginable. live a new kind of Life with one another; and could I have satisfied my self to have gone on with it, I believe it might have continued as long as we had continu'd alive together. One Evening as we were sitting and talking together under a litting Auning, which serv'd as an Arbour at the Entrance into the Garden he was in a very pleasant agreeable Humour, and said abundance of kind things to me, relating to the Pleasure of our present good Agreement, and the Disorders of our past Breach, and what a Satisfaction it was to him, that we had room to hope we should never have any more of it. be more delighted than I was, in the good Agreement we had always kept up, or more afflicted with the Breach of it, but I was sorry to tell him that there was an unhappy Circumstance in our Case, which lay too close to my Heart, and which I knew not how to break to him, that rendred my part of it very miserable, and took from me all the Comfort of the rest. to do it, that while it was conceal'd from him, I alone was unhappy, but if he knew it also, we should be both so; and that therefore to keep him in the dark about it was the kindest thing that I could do, and it was on that account alone that I kept a Secret from him, the very keeping of which I thought would first or last be my Destruction. importunity which he used with me to discover it to him: He told me I could not be call'd kind to him, nay, I could not be faithful to him, if I conceal'd it from him; I told him I thought so too, and yet I could not do it. He went back to what I had said before to him, and told me he hoped it did not relate to what I had said in my Passion; and that he had resolv'd to forget all that, as the Effect of a rash provok'd Spirit; I told him I wish'd I could forget it all too, but that it was not to be done, the Impression was too deep, and it was impossible. that therefore he would importune me no more about it, resolving to acquiesce in whatever I did or said; only begg'd I would then agree, that whatever it was, it should no more interrupt our Quiet and our mutual Kindness. wanted his farther importunities, that I might be prevail'd with to bring out that which indeed was like Death to me to conceal; so I answer'd him plainly, that I could not say I was glad not to be importuned, tho' I could not tell how to comply; but come, my Dear, said I, what Conditions will you make with me upon the opening this Affair to you? me; well, said I, come give it me under your Hand, that if you do not find I am in any Fault, or that I am willingly concern'd in the Causes of the Misfortunes that is to follow, you will not blame me, use me the worse, do me any Injury, or make me be the Sufferer for that which is not my fault. you for that which is not your fault; give me a Pen and Ink, says he, so I ran in and fetch'd Pen, Ink and Paper, and he wrote the Condition down in the very Words I had proposed it, and sign'd it with his Name; well, says he what is next, my Dear? Why, says I, the next is that you will not blame me for not discovering the Secret to you before I knew it. Very just again, says he, with all my Heart; so he wrote down that also and sign'd it. you, and that is, that as there is no body concern'd in it but you and I, you shall not discover it to any Person in the World, except your own Mother; and that in all the Measures you shall take upon the Discovery, as I am equally concern'd in it with you. tho' as Innocent as your self, you shall do nothing in a Passion, nothing to my Prejudice, or to your Mother's Prejudice, without my Knowledge and Consent. them over and over before he sign'd them, hesitating at them several times, and repeating them; my Mother's Prejudice! and your Prejudice! What mysterious thing can this be? however, at last he signed it. are to bear the most unxpected and surprizing thing that perhaps ever befel any Family in the World, I beg you to promise me you will receive it with Composure and a Presence of Mind suitable to a Man of Sense. suspence, for you terrify me with all these Preliminaries. was not your lawful Wife, and that our Children were not legal Children, so I must let you know now in calmness, and in kindness, but with Affliction enough, that I am your own Sister, and you my own Brother, and that we are both the Children of our Mother now alive, and in the House, who is convinc'd of the Truth of it, in a manner not to be denied or contradicted. and receive it with Presence of Mind; for who cou'd have said more to prepare you for it, than I have done? However I call'd a Servant, and got him a little Glass of Rum, which is the usual Dram of the Country, for he was just fainting away. sure requires a long Explanation, and therefore have Patience and compose your Mind to hear it out, and I'll make it as short as I can, and with this, I told him what I thought was needful of the Fact, and particularly how my Mother came to discover it to me, as above; and now my Dear, says I, you will see Reason for my Capitulations, and that I neither have been the Cause of this Matter, nor could be so, and that I could know nothing of it before now. me; however, I know a Remedy for it all, and a Remedy that shall put an End to all your Difficulties, without your going to England. That would be strange, said I, as all the rest; No, No, says he I'll make it easy, there's no Body in the way of it all, but my self: He look'd a little disorder'd, when he said this, but I did not apprehend any thing from it at that time, believing, as it us'd to be said, that they who do those things never talk of them; or that they who talk of such things never do them. Pensive and Melancholly; and in a Word, as I thought a little Distemper'd in his Head: I endeavour'd to talk him into Temper, and into a kind of Scheme for our Government in the Affair, and sometimes he would be well, and talk with some Courage about it; but the Weight of it lay too heavy upon his Thoughts, and went so far that he made two Attempts upon himself, and in one of them had actually strangled himself, and had not his Mother come into the Room in the very Moment, he had died; but with the help of a Negro Servant, she cut him down and recover'd him. revive that Affection, which at first I really had for him, and I endeavour'd sincerely, by all the kind Carriage I could, to make up the Breach; but in short it had gotten too great a Head, it prey'd upon his Spirits, and it threw him into a ling'ring Consumption, tho' it happen'd not to be Mortal. In this Distress I did not know what to do, as his Life was apparently declining, and I might perhaps have Marry'd again there, very much to my Advantage, it had been my Business to have staid in the Country; but my Mind was restless too, I hanker'd after coming to England, and nothing would satisfy me without it. decaying, as I observ'd, was at last prevail'd with, and so my Fate pushing me on, the way was made clear for me and my Mother concurring, I obtain'd a very good Cargo for my coming to England. that after I arriv'd, he should pretend to have an Account that I was dead in England, and so might Marry again when he wou'd; he promis'd, and engag'd to me, to Correspond with me as a Sister, and to Assist and Support me as long as I liv'd and that if he dy'd before me, he would leave sufficient to his Mother to take Care of me still, in the Name of a Sister, and he was in some respect just to this; but it was so oddly mannag'd that I felt the Disappointments very sensibly afterwards, as you shall hear in its time. Country, and now a new Scene of Misfortunes attended me, which perhaps few Women have gone thro the like. England, and where we arriv'd in two and thirty Days, but were then ruffled with two or three Storms, one of which drove us away to the Coast of Ireland, and we put in at Kinsale: We remaind there about thirteen Days got some Refreshment on Shore, and put to Sea again, tho' we met with very bad Weather again in which the Ship sprung her Main mast, as they call'd it: But we got at last into Milford Haven in Wales, where tho it was remote from our Port, yet having my Foot safe upon the firm Ground of the Isle of Britain, I resolv'd to venture it no more upon the Waters, which had been so terrible to me; so getting my Cloaths and Money on Shore with my Bills of Loading, and other Papers, I resolv'd to come for London, and leave the Ship to get to her Port as she could; the Port whither she was bound, was to Bristol, where my Brother's chief Correspondent liv'd. after, that the Ship was arriv'd at Bristol, but at the same time had the Misfortune to know that by the violent Weather she had been in, and the breaking of her Main-mast, she had great Damage on Board, and that a great part of her Cargoe was spoil'd. had; I was come away with a kind of final Farewel; what I brought with me, was indeed considerable, had it come safe, and by the help of it, I might have married again tollerably well; but as it was, I was reduc'd to between two or three Hundred Pounds in the whole, and this without any hope of Recruit. I was entirely without Friends, nay, even so much as without Acquaintances, for I found it was absolutely necessary not to revive former Acquaintance; and as for my subtle Friend that set me up formerly for a Fortune, she was dead and her Husband also. Journey to Bristol, and during my Attendance upon that Affair, I took the Diversion of going to the Bath, for as I was still far from being old, so my Humour, which was always Gay, continu'd so to an Extream; and being now, as it were, a Woman of Fortune, tho' I was a Woman without a Fortune, I expected something, or other might happen in the way, that might mend my Circumstances, as had been my Case before. I went thither indeed in the View of taking what might offer; but I must do my self Justice, as to protest I meant nothing but in an honest way, nor had any Thoughts about me at first that look'd the way, which afterwards I suffered them to be guided. contracted some unhappy Acquaintance, which rather prompted the Follies I fell afterwards into, than fortify'd me against them.  I liv'd pleasantly enough, kept good Company, that is to say, gay fine Company; but had the Discouragement to find this way of Living sunk me exceedingly, and that as I had no settled Income so spending upon the main Stock, was but a certain kind of bleeding to Death; and this gave me many sad Reflections: However I shook them off and still flatter'd my self that something or other might offer for my Advantage. I had set my self tollerably up, some honest Sea Captain or other might have talk'd with me upon the honourable Terms of Matrimony; but I was at the Bath, where Men find a Mistress sometimes, but very rarely look for a Wife: and Consequently all the Particular Acquaintances a Woman can expect there, must have some Tendency that way. Acquaintance with a Gentleman, who came to the Bath for his Diversion, yet I had enter'd into no felonious Treaty: I had resisted some Casual Offers of Gallantry, and had manag'd that way well enough; I was not wicked enough to come into the Crime for the meer Vice of it, and I had no extraordinary Offers that tempted me with the main thing which I wanted. Acquaintance with a Woman in whose House I lodg'd, who tho' she did not keep an ill House, yet had none of the best Principles in her self: I had on all Occasions behav'd my self so well as not to get the least Slur upon my Reputation, and all the Men that I had convers'd with, were of so good Reputation that I had not gotten the least Reflection, by conversing with them; nor did any of them seem to think there was room for a wicked Correspondence, if they had offered it; yet there was one Gentleman, as above, who always singled me out for the Diversion of my Company, as he call'd it, which, as he was pleased to say, was very agreeable to him, but at that time there was no more in it. for tho' I went to Bristol sometimes for the disposing my Effects, and for Recruits of Money, yet I chose to come back to the Bath for my Residence, because being on good Terms with the Woman, in whose House I lodg'd in the Summer, I found that during the Winter I liv'd rather cheaper there than I could do any where else; here, I say, I pass'd the Winter as heavily as I had pass'd the Autumn chearfully; but having contracted a nearer Intimacy with the said Woman, in whose House I lodg'd, I could not avoid communicating something of what lay hardest upon my Mind, and particularly the narrowness of my Circumstances: I told her also that I had a Mother and a Brother in Virginia in good Circumstances, and as I had really written back to my Mother in particular to represent my Condition, and the great Loss I had receiv'd, so I did not fail to let my new Friend know, that I expected a Supply from thence, and so indeed I did; and as the Ships went from Bristol, to York-River in Virginia, and back again generally in less time than from London, and that my Brother corresponded chiefly at Bristol, I thought it was much better for me to wait here for my Returns, than to go to London. so very kind, as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low a Price during the Winter, that she convinc'd me she got nothing by me; and as for Lodging, during the Winter, I paid nothing at all. could, and I lodg'd with her for a time, till it was found necessary to do otherwise; she had some Persons of Character that frequently lodg'd in her House, and in particular the Gentleman who, as I said, singled me out for his Companion in the Winter before; and he came down again with another Gentleman in his Company and two Servants, and lodg'd in the same House: I suspected that my Landlady had invited him thither, letting him know that I was still with her, but she deny'd it. peculiar Confidence; he was a compleat Gentleman, that must be confess'd, and his Company was agreeable to me, as mine, if I might believe him, was to him; he made no Professions to me, but of an extraordinary Respect, and he had such an Opinion of my Virtue, that, as he often profess'd, he believ'd if he should offer any thing else, I should reject him with Contempt; he soon understood from me that I was a Widow, that I had arriv'd at Bristol from Virginia by the last Ships; and that I waited at the Bath till the next Virginia Fleet should arrive, by which I expected considerable Effects; I understood by him, that he had a Wife, but that the Lady was distemper'd in her Head, and was under the Conduct of her own Relations, which he consented to to avoid any Reflection that might be cast upon him for mismanaging her Cure; and in the mean time he came to the Bath to divert his Thoughts under such a melancholly Circumstance. Occasions, gave me an advantageous Character of him, as of a Man of Honour and of Virtue, as well as of a great Estate; and indeed I had Reason to say so of him too, for tho' we lodg'd both on a Floor, and he had frequently come into my Chamber, even when I was in Bed, and I also into his, yet he never offered any thing to me farther than a Kiss, or so much as solicited me to any thing till long after, as you shall hear. again used to tell me, she believ'd it was so from the Beginning; however she used to tell me that she thought I ought to expect some Gratifications from him for my Company, for indeed he did as it were engross me. I told her, I had not given him the least Occasion to think I wanted it, or that I would accept of it from him; She told me, she would take that part upon her, and she manag'd it so dextrously, that the first time we were together alone, after she had talk'd with him, he began to enquire a little into my Circumstances, as how I had subsisted my self since I came on shore, and whether I did not want Money?  I stood off very boldly, I told him that tho' my Cargoe of Tobacco was damag'd, yet that it was not quite lost; that the Merchat that I had been consign'd to had so honestly managed for me that I had not wanted, and that I hop'd, with frugal Management, I should make it hold out till more would come, which I expected by the next Fleet; that in the mean time I had retrench'd my Expences and whereas I kept a Maid last Season, now I liv'd without; and whereas I had a Chamber and a Dining Room then on the first Floor, I now had but one Room two Pair of Stairs, and the like; but I live, said I, as well satisfy'd now as then; adding, that his Company had made me live much more chearfully than otherwise I should have done, for which I was much oblig'd to him; and so I put off all room for any Offer at the present: It was not long before he attack'd me again, and told me he found that I was backward to trust him with the Secret of my Circumstances, which he was sorry for; assuring me that he enquir'd into it with no design to satisfy his own Curiosity, but meerly to assist me if there was any Occasion; but since I would not own my self to stand in need of any Assistance, he had but one thing more to desire of me, and that was, that I would promise him that when I was any way streighten'd, I would frankly tell him of it, and that I would make use of him with the same Freedom that he made the Offer; adding, that I should always find I had a true Friend, tho' perhaps I was afraid to trust him. to let him know, that I had a due Sense of his Kindness; and indeed from that time, I did not appear so much reserv'd to him as I had done before, tho' still within the Bounds of the strictest Virtue on both sides; but how free soever our Conversation was, I could not arrive to that Freedom which he desir'd, viz. to tell him I wanted Money, tho' I was secretly very glad of his Offer. my Landlady, a cunning Creature, who had often press'd me to it, but found that I could not do it, makes a Story of her own inventing, and comes in bluntly to me when we were together, O! Widow, says she, I have bad News to tell you this Morning: What is that, said I, is the Virginia Ships taken by the French? for that was my Fear. No, no, says she, but the Man you sent to Bristol Yesterday for Money is come back, and says he has brought none. prompting him, which he did not want, and I saw that I should lose nothing by being backward, so took her up short; I can't imagine why he should say so, said I, for I assure you he brought me all the Money I sent him for, and here it is, said I, (pulling out my Purse with about 12 Guineas in it) and added, I intend you shall have most of it by and by. taking it as I fancy'd he would, as something forward of her; but when he saw me give such an Answer, he came immediately to himself: The next Morning we talk'd of it again, when I found he was fully satisfied; and smiling said, he hop'd I would not want Money, and not tell him of it, and that I had promis'd him otherwise: I told him I had been very much dissatisfied at my Landlady's talking so publickly the Day before of what she had nothing to do with; but I suppos'd she wanted what I ow'd her, which was about Eight Guineas, which I had resolv'd to give her, and had given it her the same Night. and it went off into some other Discourse at that time; but the next Morning he having heard me up before him, he call'd to me, and I answer'd; he ask'd me to come into his Chamber; he was in Bed when I came in, and he made me come and sit down on his Bed side for he said he had something to say to me. After some very kind Expressions, he ask'd me, if I would be very honest to him, and give a sincere Answer to one thing he would desire of me: After some little Cavil with him at the word Sincere, and asking him if I had ever given him any Answers which were not Sincere, I promis'd him I would; why then his Request was, he said, to let him see my Purse; I immediately put my Hand into my Pocket, and laughing at him, pull'd it out, and there was in it three Guineas and a Half; then he ask'd me, if there was all the Money I had? I told him no, laughing again, not by a great deal. Money I had, every Farthing: I told him I would, and I went into my Chamber, and fetch'd him a little private Drawer, where I had about six Guineas more, and some Silver, and threw it all down upon the Bed, and told him there was all my Wealth, honestly to a Shilling: He look'd a little at it, but did not tell it, and huddled it all into the Drawer again, and then reaching his Pocket, pull'd out a Key, and bad me open a little Walnut-tree Box he had upon the Table, and bring him such a Drawer, which I did; in this Drawer, there was a great deal of Money in Gold, I believe near 200 Guineas, but I knew not how much: He took the Drawer, and taking me by the Hand, made me put it in, and take a whole Handful; I was backward at that, but he held my Hand hard in his Hand, and put it into the Drawer, and made me take out as many Guineas almost as I could well take up at once. Drawer, and pour'd out all my own Money among his, and bad me get me gone, and carry it all into my own Chamber. it, and to show the Temper with which we convers'd: It was not long after this, but he began every Day to find Fault with my Cloaths, with my Laces, and Head dresses; and in a Word, press'd me to buy better, which by the way I was willing enough to do, tho' I did not seem to be so; I lov'd nothing in the World better than fine Cloaths, but I told him I must Housewife the Money he had lent me, or else I should not be able to pay him again.  He then told me in a few Words, that as he had a sincere Respect for me, and knew my Circumstances, he had not lent me that Money, but given it me, and that he thought I had merited it from him, by giving him my Company so intirely as I had done: After this, he made me take a Maid, and keep House, and his Friend being gone, he obliged me to dyet him, which I did very willingly, believing, as it appear'd, that I should lose nothing by it, nor did the Woman of the House fail to find her Account in it too. away at the Bath, he talk'd of going away, and fain he would have me to go to London with him. I was not very easy in that Proposal, not knowing what Posture I was to live in there, or how he might use me: But while this was in Debate, he fell very Sick; he had gone out to a Place in Somersetshire, call'd Shepton, and was there taken very ill, and so ill that he could not Travel, so he sent his Man back to the Bath, to beg me that I would hire a Coach and come over to him: Before he went, he had left his Money and other things of Value with me and what to do with them I did not know, but I secur'd them as well as I could, and lock'd up the Lodgings and went to him, where I found him very ill indeed, so I perswaded him to be carryed in a Litter to Bath, where was more Help and better Advice to be had. Miles, as I remember; here he continued very ill of a Fever, and kept his Bed five Weeks, all which time I nurs'd him and tended him as carefully as if I had been his Wife; indeed if I had been his Wife I could not have done more; I sat up with him so much and so often, that at last indeed he would not let me sit up any longer, and then I got a Pallet Bed into his Room, and lay in it just at his Bed's Feet. Apprehensions of losing such a Friend as he was, and was like to be to me, and I us'd to sit and cry by him many Hours together: At last he grew better, and gave hopes that he would recover, as indeed he did, tho' very slowly. I should not be backward to disclose it, as it is apparent I have done in other Cases; but I affirm, through all this Conversation, abating the coming into the Chamber when I or he was in Bed and the necessary Offices of attending him Night and Day, when he was Sick, there had not pass'd the least immodest.

O! that it had been so to the last. remov'd my Palet Bed, but he would not let me, till he was able to venture himself without any Body to sit up with him, when I remov'd to my own Chamber. when he grew well he made me a Present of Fifty Guineas for my Care, and, as he call'd it, hazarding my Life to save his. me, but with the utmost reserve for my Virtue, and his own: I told him I was fully satisfy'd of it; he carried it that length that he protested to me, that if he was naked in Bed with me, he would as sacredly preserve my Virtue, as he would defend it, if I was assaulted by a Ravisher; I believ'd him, and told him I did so; but this did not satisfy him, he would, he said, wait for some Opportunity to give me an undoubted Testimony of it. to Bristol, upon which he hir'd me a Coach, and would go with me; and now indeed our Intimacy increas'd: From Bristol he carry'd me to Gloucester, which was meerly a Journey of Pleasure to take the Air; and here it was our hap to have no Lodgings in the Inn but in one large Chamber with two Beds in it: The Master of the House going with us to show his Rooms, and coming into that Room, said very frankly to him, Sir, It is none of my Business to enquire whether the Lady be your Spouse or no, but if not, you may lye as honestly in these two Beds as if you were in two Chambers, and with that he pulls a great Curtain which drew quite cross the Room, and effectually divided the Beds; well, says my Friend, very readily, these Beds will do, and as for the rest, we are too near a Kin to lye together, tho' we may lodge near one another; and this put an honest Face on the thing too.  When we came to go to Bed, he decently went out of the Room till I was in Bed, and then went to Bed in the other Bed, but lay there talking to me a great while. with me, and not offer me the least Injury, he starts out of his Bed, and now my Dear, says he, you shall see how just I will be to you, and that I can keep my Word, and away he comes to my Bed. much, if he had not made those Promises at all; so after a little struggle, I lay still and let him come to Bed; when he was there he took me in his Arms, and so I lay all Night with him, but he had no more to do with me, or offer'd any thing to me, other than embracing me, as I say, in his Arms, no not the whole Night, but rose up and dress'd him in the Morning, and left me as innocent for him as I was the Day I was born. know how the Laws of Nature Work; for he was a vigorous brisk Person; nor did he act thus on a Principle of Religion at all, but of meer Affection; insisting on it, that tho' I was to him the most agreeable Woman in the World, yet because he lov'd me he could not injure me. it was perfectly amazing. We travell'd the rest of the Journey as we did before, and came back to the Bath, where, as he had Opportunity to come to me when he would, he often repeated the same Moderation, and I frequently lay with him, and altho' all the Familiarities of Man and Wife were common to us, yet he never once offered to go any farther, and he valu'd himself much upon it; I do not say, that I was so wholly pleas'd with it as he thought I was; for I own I was much wickeder than he. times to London in that time, and once he continu'd there four Months, but to do him Justice, he always supply'd me with Money to subsist on very Handsomely. Men say, it is ill venturing too near the brink of a Command, so we found it; and here again I must do him the Justice, to own that the first Breach was not on his Part: It was one Night that we were in Bed together warm and merry, and having drank, I think, a little more both of us, than usual. tho' not in the least to disorder us, when after some other Follies which I cannot Name, and being clasp'd close in his Arms, I told him, ( I repeat it with shame and horror of Soul ) that I could find in my Heart to discharge him of his Engagement for one Night and no more. him; neither indeed had I any mind to resist him any more. Friend, for that unmusical harsh sounding Title of Whore.  In the Morning we were both at our Penitentials, I cried very heartily, he express'd himself very sorry; but that was all either of us could do at that time, and the way being thus clear'd, and the Bars of Virtue and Conscience thus remov'd, we had the less to struggle with. rest of that Week, I look'd on him with Blushes; and every now and then started that melancholly Objection, What if I should be with Child now? What will become of me then? He encouraged me by telling me that as long as I was true to him, he would be so to me; and since it was gone such a length (which indeed he never intended) yet if I was with Child, he would take care of that and me too: This harden'd us both; I assured him if I was with Child, I would die for want of a Midwife rather than name him as the Father of it; and he assured me, I should never want if I should be with Child: These mutual Assurances harden'd us in the thing, and after this we repeated the Crime as often as we pleased, till at length, as I fear'd, so it came to pass, and I was indeed with Child. think of taking Measures for the managing it, and I propos'd trusting the Secret to my Landlady, and asking her Advice, which he agreed to: My Landlady a Woman (as I found) us'd to such things, made light of it; she said, she knew it would come to that at last, and made us very merry about it: As I said above, we found her an experienced old Lady at such Work; she undertook every thing, engag'd to procure a Midwife and a Nurse, to satisfy all Enquiries, and bring us off with Reputation, and she did so very dexterously indeed. or make as if he did so; when he was gone, she acquainted the Parish Officers that there was a Lady ready to lye in at her House, but that she knew her Husband very well, and gave them, as she pretended, an account of his Name, which she call'd Sir Walter Cleave; telling them, he was a worthy Gentleman, and that he would answer for all Enquiries, and the like: This satisfied the Parish Officers presently, and I lay Inn in as much Credit as I could have done if I had really been my Lady Cleave; and was assisted in my Travail by three or four of the best Citizens Wives of Bath, which however made me a little the more Expensive to him; I often expressed my concern to him about that part, but he bid me not be concerned at it. Expences of my lying Inn, I had every thing very handsome about me; but did not affect to be so Gay or Extravagant neither; besides knowing the World, as I had done, and that such kind of things do not often last long, I took care to lay up as much Money as I could for a wet Day, as I call'd it; making him believe it was all spent upon the extraordinary Appearance of things in my lying Inn. lying Inn 200 Guineas by me, including also what was left of my own. and when he heard of it, he wrote me a very kind obliging Letter about it, and then told me, he thought it would look better for me to come away for London as soon I was up and well, that he had provided Apartments for me at Hamersmith, as if I came only from London, and that after a while I should go back to the Bath, and he would go with me. Child and a Wet-Nurse to tend and suckle it, and a Maid Servant with me, away I went for London. the Servant and the Child in the hir'd Coach, and so he brought me to my new Lodgings at Hamersmith; with which I had abundance of Reason to be very well pleas'd, for they were very handsome Rooms. wanted nothing but to be a Wife, which however could not be in this Case, and therefore on all Occasions I studied to save what I could, as I said above, against the time of Scarcity; knowing well enough that such things as these do not always continue, that Men that keep Mistresses often change them, grow weary of them, or Jealous of them, or something or other; and sometimes the Ladies that are thus well us'd, are not careful by a prudent Conduct to preserve the Esteem of their Persons, or the nice Article of their Fidelity, and then they are justly cast off with Contempt. I had no manner of Acquaintance, so no Temptation to look any farther; I kept no Company but in the Family where I lodg'd, and with a Clergyman's Lady at next Door; so that when he was absent I visited no Body, nor did he ever find me out of my Chamber or Parlour whenever he came down; if I went any where to take the Air it was always with him. most undesigned thing in the World; he often protested to me that when he became first acquainted with me, and even to the very Night when we first broke in upon our Rules he never had the least Design of lying with me; that he always had a sincere Affection for me but not the least real Inclination to do what he had done; I assured him I never suspected him, that if I had, I should not so easily have yielded to the Freedoms which brought it on; but was all a Surprize, and was owing to our having yielded too far to our mutual Inclinations that Night; and indeed I have often observ'd since, and leave it as a Caution to the Readers of this Story, that we ought to be cautious of gratifying our Inclinations in loose and lew'd Freedoms, least we find our Resolutions of Virtue fail us in the Juncture when their Assistance should be most necessary. resolv'd to let him lye with me, if he offered it; but it was because I wanted his Help, and knew of no other way of securing him: But when we were that Night together, and, as I have said, had gone such a length, I found my Weakness, the Inclinations was not to be resisted, but I was obliged to yield up all even before he ask'd it. did he ever express the least dislike of my Conduct on any other Occasion, but always protested he was as much delighted with my Company as he was the first Hour we came together. but the Reflections of Conscience oftentimes snatch a Man, especially a Man of Sense, from the Arms of a Mistress, as it did him at last, tho' on another Occasion. Conscience for the Life I led, and that even in the greatest height of the Satisfaction I ever took, yet I had the terrible prospect of Poverty and Starving, which lay on me as a frightful Spectre, so that there was no looking behind me: But as Poverty brought me into it, so fear of Poverty kept me in it, and I frequently resolv'd to leave it quite off, if I could but come to lay up Money enough to maintain me: But these were Thoughts of no weight, and whenever he came to me they vanish'd; for his Company was so Delightful, that there was no being Melancholly when he was there, the Reflections were all the Subject of those Hours when I was alone. brought him three Children, but only the first of them liv'd; and tho' I remov'd twice in that Six Years, yet I came back the Sixth Year to my first Lodgings at Hamersmith: Here it was that I was one Morning surpris'd with a kind but melancholly Letter from my Gentleman; intimating, that he was very ill, and was afraid he should have another Fit of Sickness, but that his Wife's Relations being in the House with him, it would not be practicable to have me with him, which however he express'd his great Dissatisfaction in, and that he wish'd I could be allow'd to tend and Nurse him as I did before. how it was with him; I waited a Fortnight or thereabouts, and heard nothing, which surpriz'd me, and I began to be very uneasy indeed; I think, I may say, that for the next Fornight I was near to distracted: It was my particular Difficulty, that I did not know directly where he was; for I understood at first he was in the Lodgings of his Wife's Mother; but having remov'd my self to London, I soon found, by the help of the Direction I had for writing my Letters to him, how to enquire after him, and there I found that he was at a House in Bloomsbury, whither he had remov'd his whole Family; and that his Wife, and Wife's Mother were, in the same House, tho' the Wife was not suffered to know that she was in the same House with her Husband. me almost at the last Extremity too, to have a true Account: One Night I had the Curiosity to disguise my self like a Servant Maid in a round Cap and Straw Hat, and went to the Door, as sent by a Lady of his Neighbourhood, where he liv'd before, and giving Master and Mistress's Service, I said I was sent to know how Mr. --- did, and how he had rested that Night, in delivering this Message I got the Opportunity I desir'd, for speaking with one of the Maids, I held a long Gossips Tale with her, and had all the Particulars of his Illness, which I found was a Pluresy, attended with a Cough and Fever; she told me also who was in the House, and how his Wife was, who, by her Relation, they were in some hopes might recover her Understanding; but as to the Gentleman himself, the Doctors said there was very little hopes of him, that in the Morning they thought he had been dying, and that he was but little better then, for they did not expect that he could live over the next Night. Prosperity, and to see that it was well I had plaid the good Housewife, and sav'd something while he was alive, for now I had no view of my own Living before me. above five Years old, and no Provision made for it, at least that I knew of; with these Considerations, and a sad Heart, I went home that Evening, and began to cast with my self how I should live, and in what manner to bestow my self, for the residue of my Life. was become of him; and not venturing to go my self, I sent several sham Messengers, till after a Fortnights waiting longer, I found that there was hopes of his Life, tho' he was still very ill; then I abated my sending to the House, and in some time after I learnt in the Neighbourhood that he was about House, and then that he was Abroad again. comfort my self with my Circumstances, being, as I thought, recovered; I waited a Week, and two Weeks, and with much surprize near two Months and heard nothing, but that being recovered he was gone into the Country for the Air, after his Distemper; after this it was yet two Months more, and then I understood he was come to his City-House again, but still I heard nothing from him. found two or three of them had been call'd for, but not the rest: I wrote again in a more pressing manner than ever, and in one of them let him know, that I must be forc'd to wait on him my self, representing my Circumstances, the Rent of Lodgings to pay, and the Provision for the Child wanting, and my own deplorable Condition, destitute of Subsistance after his most solemn Engagement, to take Care of, and provide for me; I took a Copy of this Letter, and finding it lay at the House, near a Month, and was not call'd for, I found Means to have the Copy of it, put into his Hands at a Coffee House, where I had found he had us'd to go. abandon'd, yet I found he had sent a Letter to me some time before, desiring me to go down to the Bath again; its Contents I shall come to presently. is look'd on with different Countenances, and seen with other Eyes then we saw them with before: My Lover had been at the Gates of Death, and at the very brink of Eternity, and it seems struck with a due Remorse, and with sad Reflections upon his past Life of Gallantry and Levity; and among the rest, his criminal Correspondence with me, which was indeed neither more or less than a long continu'd Life of Adultery, had represented it self as it really was, not as it had been formerly thought by him to be, and he look'd upon it now with a just Abhorence. such Cases of Pleasure, that whenever sincere Repentance succeeds such a Crime as this, there never fails to attend a Hatred of the Object; and the more the Affection might seem to be before, the Hatred will be more in Proportion: It will always be so, indeed it cannot be otherwise; for there cannot be a true and sincere Abhorence of the Offence, and the Love to the Cause of it remain; there will with an Abhorence of the Sin be found a Detestation of the fellow Sinner; you can expect no other. him from carrying it on to any Extream; but the short History of his Part in this Affair was thus; he perceived by my last Letter, and by the rest, which he went for after, that I was not gone to the Bath, and that his first Letter had not come to my Hand, upon which he writes me this following:  Madam, your Hand, I give you my Word it was deliver'd at your Lodgings, and to the Hands of your Maid. I need not acquaint you with what has been my Condition for some time past; and how having been at the Edge of the Grave, I am by the unexpected and undeserved Mercy of Heaven restor'd again: In the Condition I have been in, it cannot be strange to you that our unhappy Correspondence has not been the least of the Burthens which lay upon my Conscience; I need say no more, those things that must be repented of, must be also reform'd. I wish you would think of going back to the Bath, I enclose you here a Bill for 50 l. for clearing your self at your Lodgings, and carrying you down, and hope it will be no Surprize to you to add, that on this Account only, and not for any Offence given me on your side, I can SEE YOU NO MORE; I will take due care of the Child, leave him where he is, or take him with you, as you please; I wish you the like Reflections, and that they may be to your Advantage, I am, &c.  of my own Conscience were such as I cannot express, for I was not blind to my own Crime; and I reflected that I might with less Offence have continued with my Brother, since there was no Crime in our Marriage on that Score, neither of us knowing it. Wife to Mr. --- the Linnen-Draper, who tho' he had left me by the Necessity of his Circumstances, had no Power to discharge me from the Marriage Contract which was between us, or to give me a legal liberty to marry again; so that I had been no less than a Whore and an Adultress all this while: I then reproach'd my self with the Liberties I had taken, and how I had been a Snare to this Gentleman, and that indeed I was principal in the Crime; that now he was mercifully snatch'd out of the Gulph by a convincing Work upon his Mind, but that I was left as if I was abandon'd by Heaven to a continuing in my Wickedness. and did not go down to the Bath, having no Inclination to be with the Woman who I was with before, least; as I thought, she should prompt me to some wicked Course of Life again, as she had done; and besides, I was loth she should know I was cast off as above. part with the Child, and yet when I consider'd the Danger of being one time or other left with him to keep without being able to support him, I then resolv'd to leave him; but then I concluded to be near him my self too, that I might have the Satisfaction of seeing him, without the Care of providing for him. So I sent my Gentleman a short Letter that I had obey'd his Orders in all things, but that of going back to the Bath, that however parting from him was a Wound to me that I could never recover, yet that I was fully satisfied his Reflections were just, and would be very far from desiring to obstruct his Reformation. told him that those unhappy Distresses which first mov'd him to a generous Friendship for me, would, I hope, move him to a little Concern for me now; tho' the Criminal part of our Correspondence, which I believed neither of us intended to fall into at that time, was broken off; that I desir'd to repent as sincerely as he had done, but intreated him to put me in some Condition, that I might not be expos'd to Temptations from the frightful prospect of Poverty and Distress; and if he had the least Apprehensions of my being troublesome to him, I beg'd he would put me in a Posture to go back to my Mother in Virginia, from whence he knew I came, and that would put an end to all his Fears on that account; I concluded, that if he would send me 50 l. more to facilitate my going away, I would send him back a general Release, and would promise never to disturb him more with any Importunities; unless it were to hear of the well-doing of the Child who, if I found my Mother living, and my Circumstances able, I would send for and take him also off of his Hands. to Virginia, as the Account of my former Affairs there may convince any Body of; but the Business was to get this last Fifty Pounds of him, if possible, knowing well enough it would be the last Penny I was ever to expect. never troubling him any more, prevail'd effectually, and he sent me a Bill for the Money by a Person who brought with him a general Release for me to sign, and which I frankly sign'd; and thus, tho' full sore against my will, a final End was put to this Affair. Freedoms between Persons stated as we were, upon the pretence of innocent Intentions, Love of Friendship, and the like; for the Flesh has generally so great a share in those Friendships, that it is great odds, but Inclination prevails at last over the most solemn Resolutions; and that Vice breaks in at the Breaches of Decency, which really innocent Friendship ought to preserve with the greatest strictness; but I leave the Readers of these things to their own just Reflections, which they will be more able to make effectual than I, who so soon forgot my self, and am therefore but a very indifferent Monitor. all the Obligations either of Wedlock or Mistresship in the World; except my Husband the Linnen Draper, who I having not now heard from in almost Fifteen Years, no Body could blame me for thinking myself entirely from; seeing also he had at his going away told me, that if I did not hear frequently from him, I should conclude he was dead, and I might freely marry again to whom I pleas'd. Importunity, and with the Intercession of my Mother too, had a second return of some Goods from my Brother, as I now call him, in Virginia, to make up the Damage of the Cargo I brought away with me, and this too was upon the Condition of my sealing a general Release to him, which though I thought hard, but yet I was oblig'd to promise. I manag'd so well in this case, that I got my Goods away before the Release was sign'd, and then I always found something or other to say to evade the thing and to put off the signing it all; till at length I pretended I must write to my Brother, before I could do it. strength to amount, put all together, to about 400 l. so that with that I had above 450 l. I had sav'd 100 l. more, but I met with a Disaster with that, which was this; that a Goldsmith in whose Hands I had trusted it, broke, so I lost 70 l. of my Money, the Man's Composition not making above 30 l. out of his 100 l. I had a little Plate, but not much, and was well enough stock'd with Cloaths and Linnen. that I was not now the same Woman as when I liv'd at Rotherhith; for first of all I was near 20 Years older, and did not look the better for my Age, nor for my Rambles to Virginia and back again; and tho' I omitted nothing that might set me out to Advantage, except Painting, for that I never stoop'd to, yet there would always be some difference seen between Five and Twenty and Two and Forty. consider very seriously what I should do, but nothing offer'd; I took care to make the World take me for something more than I was, and had it given out that I was a Fortune, and that my Estate was in my own Hands, the last of which was very true, the first of it was as above: I had no Acquaintance, which was one of my worst Misfortunes, and the Consequence of that was, I had no Adviser, and above all, I had no Body to whom I could in confidence commit the Secret of my Circumstances to; and I found by Experience, that to be Friendless is the worst Condition, next to being in want, that a Woman can be reduc'd to: I say a Woman, because 'tis evident Men can be their own Advisers, and their own Directors, and know how to work themselves out of Difficulties and into Business better than Women; but if a Woman has no Friend to Communicate her Affairs to, and to advise and assist her, 'tis ten to one but she is undone; nay, and the more Money she has, the more Danger she is in of being wrong'd and deceiv'd; and this was my Case in the Affair of the Hundred Pound which I left in the Hand of the Goldsmith, as above, whose Credit, it seems, was upon the Ebb before, but I that had no Body to consult with, knew nothing of it, and so lost my Money. Bag of Money, or a Jewel dropt on the Highway. which is a Prey to the next Comer; if a Man of Virtue and upright Principles happens to find it, he will have it cried, and the Owner may come to hear of it again; but how many times shall such a thing fall into Hands that will make no scruple of seizing it for their own, to once that it shall come into good Hands. had no Help, no Assistance, no Guide for my Conduct. I knew what I aim'd at, and what I wanted, but knew nothing how to pursue the End by direct means; I wanted to be plac'd in a settled State of Living, and had I happen'd to meet with a sober good Husband, I should have been as true a Wife to him as Virtue it self could have form'd: If I had been otherwise, the Vice came in always at the Door of Necessity, not at the Door of Inclination; and I understood too well, by the want of it, what the Value of a settl'd Life was, to do any thing to forfeit the felicity of it; nay, I should have made the better Wife for all the Difficulties I had pass'd thro', by a great deal; not did I in any of the Times that I had been a Wife, give my Husbands the least uneasiness on account of my Behaviour. liv'd regularly, and with as much frugality as became my Circumstances, but nothing offer'd; nothing presented, and the main Stock wasted apace; what to do I knew not, the Terror of approaching Poverty lay hard upon my Spirits: I had some Money, but where to place it I knew not, nor would the Interest of it maintain me, at least not in London. North Country Gentlewoman, and nothing was more frequent in her Discourse, than her account of the cheapness of Provisions, and the easy way of living in her County; how plentiful and how cheap every thing was, what good Company they kept, and the like; till at last I told her she almost tempted me to go and live in her County; for I that was a Widow, tho' I had sufficient to live on, yet had no way of increasing it, and that London was an extravagant Place; that I found I could not live here under a Hundred Pound a Year, unless I kept no Company, no Servant, made no Appearance, and buried my self in Privacy, as if I was oblig'd to it by Necessity. else was, that I was a great Fortune, or at least that I had Three or Four Thousand Pounds, if not more, and all in my own Hands; and she was mighty sweet upon me when she thought me inclin'd in the least to go into her Country; she said she had a Sister liv'd near Liverpool, that her Brother was a considerable Gentleman there, and had a great Estate also in Ireland; that she wou'd go down there in about two Months, and if I would give her my Company thither, I should be as welcome as her self for a Month or more as I pleas'd, till I should see how I lik'd the Country; and if I thought fit to live there, she would undertake they would take care, tho' they did not entertain Lodgers themselves, they would recommend me to some agreable Family, where I should be plac'd to my content. so many Snares, and taken so many weary steps to catch a poor desolate Creature that was good for little when it was caught; and indeed I, whose Case was almost desperate, and thought I cou'd not be much worse, was not very anxious about what might befall me, provided they did me no personal Injury; so I suffered my self, tho not without a great deal of Invitation, and great Professions of sincere Friendship and real Kindess, I say, I suffer'd my self to be prevail'd upon to go with her, and accordingly I put my self in a Posture for a Journey, tho' I did not absolutely know whither I was to go. was all in Money, except as before, a little Plate. some Linnen, and my Cloaths as for Houshold stuff I had little or none, for I had liv'd always in Lodgings; but I had not one Friend in the World with whom to trust that little I had, or to direct me how to dispose of it; I thought of the Bank, and of the other Companies in London, but I had no Friend to commit the Management of it to, and to keep and carry about me Bank Bills, Talleys, Orders, and such things, I look'd upon as unsafe; that if they were lost my Money was lost, and then I was undone; and on the other hand I might be robb'd, and perhaps murder'd in a strange place for them; and what to do I knew not. where I had often been to receive the Interest of some Bills I had, and where I had found the Clark, to whom I apply'd my self, very Honest to me, and particularly so fair one time, that when I had miss-told my Money, and taken less than my due, and was coming away, he set me to rights and gave me the rest, which he might have put into his own Pocket. who was a poor friendless Widow, and knew not what to do: He told me, if I desir'd his Opinion of any thing within the reach of his Business, he would do his Endeavour that I should not be wrong'd, but that he would also help me to a good sober Person of his Acquaintance, who was a Clark in such Business too, tho' not in their House, whose Judgment was good, and whose Honesty I might depend upon; for, added he, I will answer for him, and for every step he takes; if he wrongs you, Madam, of one Farthing, it shall lye at my door; and he delights to assist People in such Cases, he does it as an act of Charity. him, I had rather have depended upon him, because I had found him Honest, but if that cou'd not be, I would take his Recommendation sooner than any ones else; I dare say, Madam, says he, that you will be as well satisfied with my Friend as with me, and he is thoroughly able to assist you, which I am not; it seems he had his Hands full of the Business of the Bank, and had engag'd to meddle with no other Business than that of his Office: He added, that his Friend should take nothing of me for his Advice or Assistance, and this indeed encourag'd me. and his Friend; as soon as I saw his Friend, and he began but to talk of the Affair, I was fully satisfied I had a very honest Man to deal with, his Countenance spoke it, and his Character, as I heard afterwards, was every where so good, that I had no room for any more doubts upon me. appointed me to come the next Day, telling me, I might in the mean time satisfy my self of him by enquiry, which however I knew not how to do, having no Acquaintance my self. into my Case, I told him my Circumstances at large, that I was a Widow come over from America, perfectly desolate and friendless; that I had a little Money, and but a little, and was almost distracted for fear of losing it, having no Friend in the World to trust with the management of it; that I was going into the North of England to live cheap, that my Stock might not waste; that I would willingly Lodge my Money in the Bank, but that I durst not carry the Bills about me; and how to Correspond about it, or with who, I knew not. being entred in the Books would entitle me to the Money at any time, and if I was in the North I might draw Bills on the Cashire and receive it when I would; but that then it wou'd be esteem'd as running Cash, and the Bank would give no Interest for it; that I might buy Stock with it, and so it would lie in store for me, but that then if I wanted to dispose of it, I must come up to Town to Transfer it, and even it would be with some difficulty I should receive the half yearly Divfdend, unless I was here in Person, or had some Friend I could trust with having the Stock in his Name to do it for me, and that would have the same difficulty in it as before; and with that he look'd hard at me and smil'd a little; at last, says he, why do you not get a head Steward, Madam, that may take you and your Money together, and then you would have the trouble taken off of your Hands?  Ay, Sir, and the Money too it may be, said I, for truly I find the hazard that way is as much as 'tis t'other way; but I remember, I said, secretly to my self, I wish you would ask me the Question fairly, I would consider very seriously on it before I said NO. earnest, but to my real Affliction, I found at last he had a Wife; but when he own'd he had a Wife he shook his Head, and said with some Concern, that indeed he had a Wife, and no Wife: I began to think he had been in the Condition of my late Lover, and that his Wife had been Lunatick, or some such thing: However, we had not much more Discourse at that time, but he told me he was in too much hurry of business then, but that if I would come home to his House after their Business was over, he would consider what might be done for me, to put my Affairs in a Posture of Security: I told him I would come, and desir'd to know where he liv'd: He gave me a Direction in Writing, and, when he gave it me he read it to me, and said there 'tis, Madam, if you dare trust your self with me: Yes Sir, said I, I believe I may venture to trust you with my self, for you have a Wife you say, and I don't want a Husband: besides, I dare trust you with my Money, which is all I have in the World, and if that were gone, I may trust my self any where. would have pleas'd me very well if they had been in earnest; but that pass'd over, I took the Directions, and appointed to be at his House at Seven o'Clock the same Evening. in order to my having Interest for it; but still some difficulty or other came in the way, which he objected as not safe; and I found such a sincere disinterested Honesty in him, that I began to think I had certainly found the honest Man I wanted; and that I could never put my self into better Hands; so I told him with a great deal of frankness that I had never met with a Man or Woman yet that I could trust, or in whom I could think my self safe, but that I saw he was so disinterestedly concern'd for my safety, that I would freely trust him with the management of that little I had, if he would accept to be Steward for a poor Widow that could give him no Salary. could not but take it very kindly that I had so good an Opinion of him; that he would not deceive me, that he would do any thing in his Power to serve me and expect no Salary; but that he could not by any means accept of a Trust that might bring him to be suspected of Self interest, and that if I should die he might have Disputes with my Executors, which he should be very loth to encumber himself with. convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty; for that first as for suspecting him, if ever now was the time to suspect him and not to put the Trust into his Hands, and whenever I did inspect him, he could but throw it up then and refuse to go on; Then as to Executors, I assur'd him I had no Heirs, nor any Relations in England and I would have neither Heirs or Executors but himself, unless I should alter my Condition, and then his Trust and Trouble should cease together, which however I had no prospect of yet; but I told him if I died as I was, it should be all his own, and he would deserve it by being so faithful to me, as I was satisfied he would be. have so much good will for him? and looking very much pleas'd said, he might very lawfully wish he was single for my sake; I smil'd and told him, that as he was not, my Offer could have no design upon him, and to wish, was not to be allow'd, 'twas Criminal to his Wife. and no Wife, and 'twould be no Sin to wish her hang'd; I know nothing of your Circumstances that way, Sir, said I; but it cannot be innocent to wish your Wife dead; I tell you, says he again, she is a Wife and no Wife; you don't know what I am, or what she is. be an honest Man, and that's the Cause of all my Confidence in you. for, says he, to be plain with you, I am a Cuckold, and she is a Whore; he spoke it in a kind of Jest, but it was with such an awkward smile, that I perceiv'd it stuck very close to him, and he look'd dismally when he said it. speaking of; but a Cuckold you know may be an honest Man, it does not alter that Case at all; besides I think, said I, since your Wife is so dishonest to you, you are too honest to her, to own her for your Wife; but that, said I, is what I have nothing to do with.  Nay, says he, I do think to clear my Hands of her, for to be plain with you, Madam, added he, I am no contented Cuckold neither: On the other hand, I assure you it provokes me to the highest Degree, but I can't help my self, she that will be a Whore, will be a Whore. could not have done with it, so I let him alone, and he went on to tell me all the Circumstances of his Case, too long to relate here, particularly, that having been out of England some time before he came to the Post he was in, she had had two Children in the mean time by an Officer of the Army; and that when he came to England, and, upon her Submission, took her again, and maintain'd her very well, yet she run away from him with a Linnen-Draper's Apprentice, robb'd him of what she could come at, and continu'd to live from him still; so that, Madam, says he, she is a Whore not by Necessity, which is the common Bait, but by Inclination, and for the sake of the Vice: talk'd of my Business, but it would not do; at last he looks steadily at me, look you, Madam, says he, you came to ask Advice of me, and I will serve you as faithfully as if you were my own Sister; but I must turn the Tables, since you oblige me to do it, and are so friendly to me, and I think I must ask Advice of you; tell me what must a poor abus'd Fellow do with a Whore? What can I do to do my self Justice upon her? she has run away from you, so you are rid of her fairly; what can you desire more?  Ay she is gone indeed, said he, but I am not clear of her for all that.  That's true, says I, she may indeed run you into Debt, but the Law has furnish'd you with Methods to prevent that also, you may Cry her down, as they call it. 'tis not that part that I speak of, but I would be rid of her that I might marry again. say, you may certainly get that done, and then you are free. suppose your Wife would not dispute the Liberty with you that she takes herself. and for the other sort, says he, I have had enough of her to meddle with any more Whores. Heart, if you had but ask'd me the Question, but that was to my self; to him I reply'd, why you shut the Door against any honest Woman accepting you, for you condemn all that should venture upon you, and conclude, that a Woman that takes you now, can't be honest. me, I'd venture it, and then turns short upon me, will you take me, Madam? least you shou'd think I wait only a Recantation of it, I shall answer you plainly NO not I; my Busihess is of another kind with you, and I did not expect you would have turn'd my serious Application to you in my distracted Case, into a Comedy. stand in as much need of Advice as you do, for I think if I have not Relief some where, I shall be mad my self, and I know not what course to take, I protest to you. speak then, says he, I beg of you, for now you encourage me. then you may find honest Women enough to ask the Question of fairly, the Sex is not so scarce that you can want a Wife. ask you one Question seriously before hand. Question I shall ask. already, said I, besides, Sir, said I, can you think so ill of me, as that I wou'd give any Answer to such a Question beforehand? Can any Woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design any thing but to banter her? it. I beg of you let me know, what you will advise me to do? talk of. say any more of it till I have the Divorce, but I desire you'll prepare to be better condition'd when that's done, for you shall be the Woman, or I will not be Divorc'd at all: I owe it to your unlooked for kindness, if to nothing else, but I have other Reasons too. however, I knew that the way to secure him was to stand off while the thing was so remote, as it appear'd to be, and that it was time enough to accept of it when he was able to perform it; so I said very respectfully to him, it was time enough to consider of these things, when he was in a Condition to talk of them; in the mean time I told him, I was going a great way from him, and he would find Objects enough to please him better: We broke off here for the present, and he made me promise him to come again the next Day, for my own Business, which after some pressing I did; tho' had he seen farther into me, I wanted no pressing on that Account. him see that I kept a Maid: He would have had me let the Maid have staid, but I would not, but order'd her aloud to come for me again about Nine a Clock, but he forbid that, and told me he would see me safe Home, which I was not very well pleased with, supposing he might do that to know where I liv'd, and enquire into my Character, and Circumstances: However, I ventur'd that, for all the People there knew of me, was to my Advantage; and all the Character he had of me, was, that I was a Woman of Fortune, and that I was a very modest sober Body; which whether true or not in the Main, yet you may see how necessary it is, for all Women who expect any thing in the World, to preserve the Character of their Virtue, even when perhaps they may have sacrifiz'd the Thing itself. Supper for me: I found also he liv'd very handsomely, and had a House very handsomely furnish'd, and which I was rejoic'd at indeed, for I look'd upon it as all my own. laid his Business very Home indeed; he protested his Affection to me, and indeed I had no room to doubt it; he declared that it began from the first Moment I talk'd with him, and long before I had mentioned leaving my Effects with him; 'tis no matter when it began, thought I, if it will but hold, 'twill be well enough: He then told me, how much the Offer I had made of trusting him with my Effects had engag'd him; so I intended it should, thought I, but then I thought you had been a single Man too: After we had Supp'd, I observ'd he press'd me very hard to drink two or three Glasses of Wine, which however I declin'd; but drank one Glass or two: He then told me he had a Proposal to make to me, which I should promise him I would not take ill, if I should not grant it: I told him I hop'd he would make no dishonourable Proposal to me, especially in his own House, and that if it was such, I desir'd he would not mention it, that I might not be obliged to offer any Resentment to him that did not become the Respect I profess'd for him, and the Trust I had plac'd in him, in coming to this House; and beg'd of him he would give me leave to go away, and accordingly began to put on my Gloves, and prepare to be gone tho' at the same time I no more intended it, than he intended to let me. from offering any such thing to me that was dishonourable, and if I thought so, he would chuse to say no more of it. thing that he had to say, depending that he would say nothing unworthy of himself, or unfit for me to hear; upon this, he told me his Proposal was this, That I would marry him, tho' he had not yet obtain'd the Divorce from the Whore his Wife; and to satify me that he meant honourably, he would promise not to desire me to live with him, or go to Bed to him till the Divorce was obtain'd: My Heart said Yes to this Offer at first Word, but it was necessary to play the Hyprocrite a little more with him; so I seem'd to declince the Motion with some warmth as unfair, told him that such a Proposal could be of no Signification, but to entangle us both in great Difficulties; for if he should not at last obtain the Divorce, yet we could not dissolve the Marriage, neither could we proceed in it; so that if he was disappointed in the Divorce, I left him to consider what a Condition we should both be in. him it was not a Proposal that had any Sense in it, then he went from it to another, viz. that I would Sign and Seal a Contract with him, Conditioning to marry him as soon as the Divorce was obtain'd, and to be void if he could not get it. first time that ever I could imagine him weak enough to be in earnest, I did not use to say Yes at first asking, I would consider of it. I plaid with this Lover, as an Angler does with a Trout: I found I had him fast on the Hook, so I jested with his new Proposal, and put him off: I told him he knew little of me, and bad him enquire about me; I let him also go Home with me to my Lodging, tho' I would not ask him to go in, for I told him it was not Decent. it, was because the Lady that had invited me to go with her into Lancashire insisted so possitively upon it, and promised me such great Fortunes, and fine things there, that I was tempted to go and try; perhaps, said I, I may mend my self very much, and then I made no scruple of quitting my honest Citizen, who I was not so much in Love with as not to leave him for a Richer. that he would know where to write to me by the Business I had entrusted with him, that I would give him a sufficient Pledge of my Respect for him; for I would leave almost all I had in the World in his Hands; and I would thus far give him my Word, that as soon as he had sued out the Divorce, if he would send me an Account of it, I would come up to London, and that then we would talk seriously of the Matter. invited thither with a Design much worse, as the Sequel will discover; well I went with my Friend, as I call'd her, into Lancashire; all the way we went she caressed me with the utmost appearance of a sincere undissembled Affection; treated me, except my Coach hire all the way; and her Brother brought a Gentleman's Coach to Warrington to receive us, and we were carried from thence to Liverpool with as much Ceremory as I could desire. We were also entertain'd at a Merchant's House in Liverpool three or four Days very handsomely: I forbear to tell his Name, because of what follow'd; then she told me she would carry me to an Uncle's House of hers where we should be nobly entertain'd, and her Uncle, as she call'd him, sent a Coach and four Horses for us, and we were carried near forty Miles I know not whither. large Park extraordinary Company indeed, and where she was call'd Cousin; I told her if she had resolv'd to bring me into such Company as this, she should have let me have furnish'd my self with better Cloaths; the Ladies took Notice of that, and told me very genteely, they did not value People in their own Country so much by their Cloaths, as they did in London; that their Cousin had fully inform'd them of my Quality, and that I did not want Cloaths to set me off; in short, they entertain'd me not like what I was, but like what they thought I had been, Namely, a Widow Lady of a great Fortune. Catholicks, and the Cousin too, nothing in the World could behave better to me; and I had all the Civility shown that I could have had, if I had been of their Opinion: The Truth is, I had not so much Principle of any kind, as to be Nice in Point of Religion; and I presently learn'd to speak favourably of the Romish Chunch; particularly I told them I saw little, but the Prejudice of Education in all the Differences that were among Christians about Religion, and if it had so happen'd that my Father had been a Roman Catholick, I doubted not but I should have been as well pleas'd with their Religion as my own. Night with good Company, and pleasant Discourse, so I had two or three old Ladies that lay at me upon the Subject of Religion too; I was so Complaisant that I made no scruple to be present at their Mass, and to conform to all their Gestures as they shew'd me the Pattern, but I would not come too cheap; so that I only in the main encouraged them to expect that I would turn Roman Catholick, if I was instructed in the Catholick Doctrine, as they call'd it, and so the matter rested. Country Village, about six Miles from Liverpool, where her Brother (as she call'd him) came to visit me in his own Charriot, with two Footmen in a good Livery; and the next thing was to make Love to me: As it happen'd to me, one would think I could not have been cheated, and indeed I thought so my self, having a safe Card at Home, which I resolv'd not to quit, unless I could mend my self very much: However in all appearance this Brother was a Match worth my listning to, and the least his Estate was valu'd at, was a 1000 l. a Year, but the Sister said it was worth 1500 l. a Year, and lay most of it in Ireland. much my Estate was; and my false Friend taking it upon a foolish hearsay had rais'd it from 500 l. to 5000 l. and by the time she came into the Country she call'd it 15000 l. the Irishman, for such I understood him to be, was stark Mad at this Bait: In short, he courted me, made me Presents, and run in Debt like a mad Man for the Expences of his Courtship: He had, to give him his due, the Appearance of an extraordinary fine Gentleman; he was tall well shap'd, and had an extraordinary Address; talk'd as naturally of his Park, and his Stables; of his Horses, his Game-keepers, his Woods, his Tenants, and his Servants, as if he had been in the Mansion house, and I had seen them all about me. that when we came to Dublin he would Joynture me in 600 l. a Year in good Land; and that he would enter into a Deed of Settlement, or Contract here, for the Performance of it. beaten out of all my Measures; I had a she Devil in my Bosom, every Hour telling me how great her Brother liv'd: One time she would come for my Orders, how I would have my Coach painted, and how lin'd; and another time what Cloaths my Page should wear: In short, my Eyes were dazled, I had now lost my Power of saying NO, and to cut the Story short, I consented to be married; but to be more private we were carried farther in the Country, and married by a Priest, which I was assur'd would marry us as effectually as a Church of England Parson. dishonourable forsaking my faithful Citizen; who lov'd me sincerely, and who was endeavouring to quit himself of a scandalous Whore by whom he had been barbarously us'd, and promis'd himself infinite Happiness in his new Choice; which Choice was now giving up her self to another in a Manner almost as Scandalous as hers could be. deceived Creature that was now my Deceiver represented every Hour to my Imagination, hurried me away, and gave me no time to think of London, or of any thing there, much less of the Obligation I had to a Person of infinitely more real Merit than what was now before me. appear'd still the same as before; great even to Magnificence, and nothing less than a Thousand Pounds a Year could support the Ordinary Equipage he appear'd in. Westchester in order to embark for Ireland. However, he did not hurry me, for we stay'd near three Weeks longer, and then he sent to Chester for a Coach to meet us at the Black-Rock, as they call it, over against Liverpool: Thither we went in a fine Boat they call a Pinnace with six Oars, his Servants, and Horses, and Baggage going in a Ferry-Boat.  He made his Excuse to me, that he had no Acquaintance at Chester, but he would go before and get some handsome Appartment for me at a private House; I ask'd him how long we should stay at Chester? he said not at all, any longer than one Night or two, but he would immediately hire a Coach to go to Holyhead; then I told him he should by no Means give himself the trouble to get Private Lodgings for one Night or two, for that Chester being a great Place, I made no doubt but there would be very good Inns and Accommodation enough; so we lodg'd at an Inn not far from the Cathedral, I forgot what Sign it was at. Affairs to settle at London before we went off; I told him No, not of any great Consequence, but what might be done as well by Letter from Dublin: Madam says he very respectfully, I suppose the greatest part of your Estate, which my Sister tells me is most of it in Money in the Bank of England, lies secure enough, but in case it requir'd Transferring, or any way altering its Property, it might be necessary to go up to London, and settle those Things before we went over. that I had no Effects in the Bank of England that I knew of; and hope he could not say that I had ever told him I had. No, he said, I had not told him so, but his Sister had said the greatest part of my Estate lay there, and I only mention'd it my Dear, said he, that if there was any Occasion to settle it, or order any thing about it, we might not be oblig'd to the hazard and trouble of another Voyage back again, for he added, that he did not care to venture me too much upon the Sea. must be! and it presently occurr'd to me that my Friend, who call'd him Brother had represented me in Colours which were not my due, and I thought that I would know the bottom of it before I went out of England, and before I should put my self into I knew not whose Hands, in a strange Country. next Morning, and letting her know the Discourse her Brother and I had been upon, I conjur'd her to tell me, what she had said to him, and upon what Foot it was that she had made this Marriage?  She own'd that she had told him that I was a great Fortune, and said that she was told so at London: Told so, says I warmly, did I ever tell you so? No, she said, it was true I never did tell her so, but I had said several times that what I had, was in my own disposal: I did so, return'd I very quick, but I never told you I had any thing call'd a Fortnne; No, that I had one Hundred Pounds, or the Value of an Hundred Pounds in the World; and how did it consist with my being a Fortune, said I that I should come here into the North of England with you, only upon the Account of living cheap? At these Words which I spoke warm and high, my Husband came into the Room, and I desir'd him to come in and sit down, for I had something of Moment to say before them both, which it was absolutely necessary he should hear. it, and came and sat down by me, having first shut the Door; upon which I began, for I was very much provok'd, and turning my self to him, I am afraid, says I, my Dear, for I spoke with kindness on his side, that you have a very great Abuse put upon you, and an Injury done you never to be repair'd in your marrying me, which however as I have had no Hand in it, I desire I may be fairly acquited of it; and that the Blame may lye where it ought and no where else, for I wash my Hands of every part of it. is to my Honour and Advantage every way; I will soon explain to it you, says I, and I fear there will be no Reason to think your self well us'd, but I will convince you, my Dear, says I again, that I have had no Hand in it. follow'd; however, looking towards me, and saying only go on, he sat silent, as if to hear what I had more say; so I went on; I ask'd you last Night, said I, speaking to him, if ever I made any boast to you of my Estate, or ever told you I had any Estate in the Bank of England, or any where else, and you own'd I had not, as is most true; and I desire you will tell me here, before your Sister, if ever I gave you any Reason from me to think so, or that ever we had any Discourse about it, and he own'd again I had not; but said, I had appeared always as a Woman of Fortune, and he depended on it that I was so, and hoped he was not deceived. I am not enquiring whether you have been deceived, said I, I fear you have, and I too; but I am clearing my self from being concern'd in deceiving you. Estate I had, or gave her any Particulars of it; and she owns I never did: And pray Madam, said I, be so just to me, to charge me if you can, if ever I pretended to you that I had an Estate; and why if I had, should I ever come down into this Country with you on purpose to spare that little I had, and live cheap? She could not deny one Word, but said she had been told in London that I had a very great Fortune, and that it lay in the Bank of England. so just to me as to tell me who has abus'd both you and me so much, as to make you believe I was a Fortune, and prompt you to court me to this Marriage?  He could not speak a Word, but pointed to her; and after some more pause, flew out in the most furious Passion that ever I saw a Man in my Life; cursing her, and calling her all the Whores and hard Names he could think of; and that she had ruin'd him, declaring that she had told him I had Fifteen Thousand Pounds, and that she was to have Five Hundred Pounds of him for procuring this Match for him: He then added, directing his Speech to me, that she was none of his Sister but had been his Whore for two Years before, that she had had one Hundred Pounds of him in part of this Bargain, and that he was utterly undone if things were as I said; and in his raving he swore he would let her Heart's Blood out immediately, which frighten'd her and me too; she cried, said she had been told so in the House where I lodg'd, but this aggravated him more than before that she should put so far upon him, and run things such a length upon no other Authority than a hear-say; and then turning to me again, said very honestly, he was afraid we were both undone; or to be plain, my Dear, I have no Estate, says he, what little I had, this Devil has made me run out in putting me into this Equipage; she took the Opportunity of his being earnest in talking with me, and got out of the Room, and I never saw her more. many ways that I had the worst of it, but his saying he was undone, and that he had no Estate neither put me into a meer Distraction; why, says I to him, this has been a hellish Juggle for we are married here upon the Foot of a double Fraud, you are undone by the Disappointment it seems, and if I had had a Fortune I had been cheated too for you say you have nothing. You would indeed have been cheated my Dear, says he, but you would not have been undone, for Fifteen Thousand Pounds would have maintain'd us both very handsomely in this Country; and I had resolv'd to have dedicated every Groat of it to you; I would not have wrong'd you of a Shilling, and the rest I would have made up in my Affection to you, and Tenderness of you as long as I liv'd. and that he was a Man that was as well qualified to make me happy, as to his Temper and Behaviour, as any Man ever was; but his having no Estate, and being run into Debt on this ridiculous Account in the Country, made all the Prospect dismal and dreadful, and I knew not what to say, or what to think. as I discovered in him, should be thus precipitated into Misery; that I saw nothing before us but Ruin, for as to me, it was my unhappiness, that what little I had was not able to relieve us a Week, and with that I pull'd out a Bank Bill of 20 l. and Eleven Guineas, which I told him I had saved out of my little Income; and that by the Account that Creature had given me of the way of living in that Country, I expected it would maintain me three or four Years; that if it was taken from me, I was left destitute, and he knew what the Condition of a Woman must be, if she had no Money in her Pocket; however, I told him, if he would take it, there it was. he would not touch it, that he abhor'd the Thoughts of striping me, and making me Miserable; that he had Fifty Guineas left, which was all he had in the World, and he pull'd it out and threw it down on the Table, bidding me take it, tho' he were to Starve for want of it. him talk so; that on the contrary, if he could propose any probable Method of living, I would do any thing that became me, and that I would live as narrow as he could desire. Distracted; he said, he was bred a Gentleman, tho' he was reduc'd to a low Fortune, and that there was but one way left which he could think of, and that would not do, unless I cou'd answer him one Question, which however he said he would not press me to; I told him I would answer it honestly, whether it would be to his Satisfaction or no, that I could not tell. keep us together in any Figure, or in any Station or Place, or will it not? at all; No, not so much as my Name; and seeing there was nothing to be expected from him, however good humour'd, and however honest he seem'd to be, but to live on what I knew would soon be wasted, I resolv'd to conceal every thing but the Bank-Bill, and Eleven Guineas, and I would have been very glad to have lost that, and have been set down where he took me up: I had indeed another Bank-Bill about me of 30 l. which was the whole of what I brought with me, as well to subsist on in the Country, as not knowing what might offer; because this Creature, the go-between that had thus betray'd us both, had made me believe strange things of marrying to my Advantage, and I was not willing to be without Money whatever might happen. This Bill I conceal'd, and that made me the freer of the rest, in Consideration of his Circumstances, for I really pitied him heartily. him, and I never would: I was very sorry to tell him that the little I had would not subsist us; that it was not sufficient to subsist me alone in the South Country, and that this was the Reason that made me put my self into the Hands of that Woman who call'd him Brother, she having assured me that I might board very handsomely at a Town call'd Manchester, where I had not yet been, for about six Pounds a Year, and my whole Income not being above 5 l. a Year, I thought I might live easy upon it, and wait for better things. had; however we supp'd together, and lay-together that Night and when we had almost supp'd he look'd a little better and more chearful, and call'd for a Bottle of Wine; Come my Dear says he, tho' the Case is bad it is to no Purpose to be dejected, Come be as easy as you can, I will endeavour to find out some way or other to live; if you can but subsist your self, that is better than nothing, I must try the World again; a Man ought to think like a Man: To be discouraged, is to yield to the Misfortune; with this he fill'd a Glass, and drank to me, holding my Hand all the while the Wine went down, and protesting his main concern was for me. Grievous to me: 'Tis something of Relief even to be undone by a Man of Honour, rather than by a Scoundrel; but here the greatest Disappointment was on his side for he had really spent a great deal of Money and it was very remarkable on what poor Terms she proceeded; first the baseness of the Creatue herself is to be observ'd, who for the getting One Hundred Pounds herself, could be content to let him spend Three or Four more tho' perhaps it was all he had in the World, and more than all; when she had not the least Ground more than a little Tea-Table Chat, to say that I had any Estate, or was a Fortune, or the like: It is true the design of deluding a Woman of Fortune if I had been so was base enough; the putting the Face of great Things upon poor Circumstances was a Fraud, and bad enough; but the Case a little differ'd too, and that in his Favour, for he was not a Rake that made a Trade to delude Women, and as some has done get six or seven Fortunes after one another, and then rifle and run away from them; but he was already a Gentleman, unfortunate and low, but had liv'd well; and tho' if I had had a Fortune, I should have been enrag'd at the Slut for betraying me; yet really for the Man, a Fortune would not have been ill bestow'd on him, for he was a lovely Person indeed; of generous Principles, good Sense, and of abundance of good Humour. slept much; he was as Penitent, for having put all those Cheats upon me, as if it had been Fellony, and that he was going to Execution; he offered me again every Shilling of the Money he had about him, and said, he would go into the Army and seek for more. I ask'd him why he would be so unkind to carry me into Ireland, when I might suppose he could not have subsisted me there? He took me in his Arms, My Dear, said he, I never design'd to go to Ireland at all, much less to have carried you thither; but came hither to be out of the Observation of the People, who had heard what I pretended to, and that No Body might ask me for Money before I was furnish'd to supply them. laid it; I purposed here to ask you something about your Estate, as you see I did, and when you, as I expected you would, had enter'd into some Account of the Particulars, I would have made an Excuse to have put off our Voyage to Ireland for some time, and so have gone for London. Circumstances of my own Affairs to you, and let you know I had indeed made use of these Artifices to obtain your Consent to marry me, but had now nothing to do but to ask you Pardon, and to tell you how abundantly I would endeavour to make you forget what was past, by the Felicity of the Days to come. my Affliction now, that I am not in a Condition to let you see how easily I should have been reconcil'd to you; and have pass'd by all the Tricks you had put upon me, in Recompence of so much good Humour; but my Dear, said I, what can we do now? We are both undone, and what better are we for our being reconcil'd, seeing we have nothing to live on. nothing to begin with: He beg'd me at last to talk no more of it, for he said I would break his Heart; so we talk'd of other things a little, till at last he took a Husband's leave of me, and so went to Sleep. Night, I was very sleepy, and lay till near Eleven o'Clock, in this time he took his Horses, and three Servants, and all his Linnen and Baggage, and away he went, leaving a short, but moving Letter for me on the Table, as follows:  Creature, contrary to my Principle, and the general Practice of my Life: Forgive me, my Dear! I ask you Pardon with the greatest Sincerity; I am the most miserable of Men, in having deluded you: I have been so happy to Possess you, and am now so wretched as to be forc'd to fly from you: Forgive me, my Dear, once more I say forgive me,!  I am not able to see you ruin'd by me, and my self unable to support you: Our Marriage is nothing, I shall never be able to see you again: I here discharge you from it; if you can marry to your Advantage do not decline it on my Account; I here swear to you on my Faith, and on the Word of a Man of Honour, I will never disturb your Repose if I should know of it, which however is not likely: On the other hand if you should not marry, and if good Fortune should befall me, it shall be all yours where ever you are. I have put some of the Stock of Money I have left into your Pocket; take Places for your self and your Maid in the Stage Coach, and go for London; I hope it will bear your Charges thither, without breaking into your own: Again I sincerely ask your Pardon, and will do so, as often as I shall ever think of you. Adieu my Dear for ever, I am yours most Affectionately. J. E.  Farewel: I reproach'd him a Thousand times in my Thoughts for leaving me, for I would have gone with him thro' the World, if I had beg'd my Bread. I felt in my Pocket, and there I found ten Guineas, his Gold Watch, and two little Rings, one a small Diamond Ring, worth only about six Pound, and the other a plain Gold Ring. spoke a Word, till my Maid interrupted me, by telling me my Dinner was ready: I eat but little, and after Dinner I fell into a violent Fit of Crying, every now and then, calling him by his Name, which was James, O Jemy! said I, come back, come back, I'll give you all I have; I'll beg, I'll starve with you: And thus I run Raving about the Room several times, and then sat down between whiles, and then walking about again, call'd upon him to come back, and then cry'd again; and thus I pass'd the Afternoon, till about seven o'Clock, when it was near Dusk in the Evening being August, when to my unspeakable Surprize he comes back into the Inn, and comes directly up into my Chamber. imagine what should be the Occasion of it; and began to be at odds with my self whether to be glad or sorry; but my Affection byass'd all the rest, and it was impossible to conceal my Joy, which was too great for Smiles, for it burst out into Tears. He was no sooner enter'd the Room, but he run to me and took me in his Arms, holding me fast and almost stopping my Breath with his Kisses, but spoke not a Word; at length I began, my Dear, said I, How could you go away from me? To which he gave no Answer, for it was impossible for him to speak. Miles, but it was not in his Power to go any farther, without coming back to see me again, and to take his leave of me once more. come back again; he told me he heard me very plain upon Delamere Forest, at a Place about 12 Miles off: I smil'd; Nay says he, Do not think I am in Jest, for if ever I heard your Voice in my Life, I heard you call me aloud, and sometimes I thought I saw you running after me; Why said I, what did I say? for I had not nam'd the Words to him, you call'd aloud says he, and said, O Jemy! O Jemy! come back, come back. I heard your Voice as plain as you hear mine now; if you please, I'll go before a Magistrate and make Oath of it; I then began to be amaz'd and surpriz'd, and indeed frighted, and told him what I had really done, and how I had call'd after him, as above.  When we had amus'd ourselves a while about this, I said to him, well, you shall go away from me no more, I'll go all over the World with you rather: He told me, it would be a very difficult thing for him to leave me, but since it must be, he hoped I would make it as easy to me as I could; but as for him, it would be his Destruction, that he foresaw. London alone, which was a long Journey; and that as he might as well go that way, as any way else, he was resolv'd to see me thither, or near it; and if he did go away then without taking his leave, I should not take it ill of him, and this he made me promise. sent the Fellows away to seek their Fortunes, and all in a little time at a Town on the Road, I know not where; and, says he, it cost me some Tears all alone by my self, to think how much happier they were than their Master, for they could go to the next Gentleman's House to see for a Service, whereas, said he, I knew not whither to go, or what to do with my self. not be worse; and that now he was come again, I would not go from him, if he would take me with him, let him go whither he would, and in the mean time I agreed that we would go together to London; but I could not be brought to consent he should go away at last, and not take his leave of me; but told him Jesting, that if he did, I would call him back again as loud as I did before; Then I pull'd out his Watch and gave it him back, and his two Rings, and his Ten Guineas; but he would not take them, which made me very much suspect that he resolv'd to go off upon the Road, and leave me. his Letter, the kind Gentlemanly Treatment I had from him in all the Affair, with the Concern he show'd for me in it, his manner of Parting with that large Share which he gave me of his little Stock left, all these had join'd to make such Impressions on me, that I could not bear the Thoughts of parting with him. Horseback; I dismiss'd my Maid at Chester; he was very much against my being without a Maid, but she being hired in the Country, keeping no Servant at London: I told him it would have been barbarous to have taken the poor Wench, and have turn'd her away as soon as I came to Town; and it would also have been a needless Charge on the Road, so I satisfy'd him, and he was easy on that Score. then he told me Fate and his own Misfortunes oblig'd him to leave me, and that it was not Convenient for him to go to London for Reasons, which it was of no value to me to know, and I saw him preparing to go. The Stage Coach we were in, did not usually stop at Dunstable, but I desiring it for a Quarter of an Hour, they were content to stand at an Inn-Door a while, and we went into the House. that was, that since he could not go any farther, he would give me leave to stay a Week or two in the Town with him, that we might in that time think of something to prevent such a ruinous thing to us both, as a final Separation would be; and that I had something of Moment to offer to him, which perhaps he might find Practicable to our Advantage. of the House, and told her, his Wife was taken ill, and so ill that she cou'd not think of going any farther in the Stage Coach, which had tir'd her almost to Death, and ask'd if she cou'd not get us a Lodging for two or three Days in a private House where I might rest me a little, for the Journey had been too much for me? The Landlady, a good sort of a Woman, well bred, and very obliging, came immediately to see me; told me, she had two or three very good Rooms in a part of the House quite out of the Noise, and if I saw them, she did not doubt but I would like them, and I should have one of her Maids, that should do nothing else but wait on me; this was so very kind, that I could not but accept of it; so I went to look on the Rooms, and lik'd them very well, and indeed they were extraordinarily Furnish'd, and very pleasant Lodgings; so we paid the Stage Coach, took out our Baggage, and resolv'd to stay here a while. but would not let him spend a Shilling of his own: We had some kind squabble about that, but I told him it was the last time I was like to enjoy his Company, and I desir'd he would let me be Master in that thing only, and he should govern in every thing else, so he acquiesc'd. make the Proposal to him I had told him of; accordingly I related to him how I had liv'd in Virginia, that I had a Mother, I believ'd, was alive there still, tho' my Husband was dead some Years; I told him, that had not my Effects miscarry'd, which by the way I magnify'd pretty much, I might have been Fortune good enough to him to have kept us from being parted in this manner: Then I enter'd into the manner of Peoples settling in those Countries, how they had a quantity of Land given them by the Constitution of the Place; and if not, that it might be purchased at so easy a Rate that it want worth naming. with carrying over but two or three Hundred Pounds value in English Goods, with some Servants and Tools, a Man of Application wou'd presently lay a Foundation for a Family, and in few Years would raise an Estate. Cur'd and Prepar'd, and what the usual Increase of it was; and demonstrated to him, that in a very few Years, with such a Beginning, we should be as certain of being Rich, as we were now certain of being Poor. Conversation for near a Week together, in which time I laid it down in black and white, as we say, that it was morally impossible, with a supposition of any reasonable good Conduct, but that we must thrive there and do very well. or thereabouts; and I argued with him how good a Method it would be to put an end to our Misfortunes, and restore our Circumstances in the World, to what we had both expected; and I added, that after seven Years, we might be in a Posture to leave our Plantation in good Hands, and come over again and receive the Income of it, and live here and enjoy it; and I gave him Examples of some that had done so, and liv'd now in very good Figure in London. something or other broke it off; till at last he turn'd the Tables, and began to talk almost to the same purpose of Ireland. that cou'd but find Stock to enter upon any Land, should have Farms there for 50 l. a Year, as good as were let here for 200 l. a Year; that the Produce was such, and so Rich the Land, that if much was not laid up, we were sure to live as handsomely upon it as a Gentleman of 3000 l. a Year could do in England; and that he had laid a Scheme to leave me in London, and go over and try; and if he found he could lay a handsome Foundation of living suitable to the Respect he had for me, as he doubted not he should do, he would come over and fetch me. at my Word, viz. to turn my little Income into Money, and let him carry it over into Ireland and try his Experiment with it; but he was too just to desire it, or to have accepted it if I had offer'd it; and he anticipated me in that, for he added, that he would go and try his Fortune that way, and if he found he cou'd do any thing at it to live, then by adding mine to it when I went over, we should live like our selves; but that he would not hazard a Shilling of mine till he had made the Experiment with a little, and he assur'd me that if he found nothing to be done in Ireland, he would then come to me and join in my Project of Virginia. not withstand him; however, he promis'd to let me hear from him in a very little time after his arriving there, to let me know whether his prospect answer'd his Design, that if there was not a probability of Success, I might take the Occasion to prepare for our other Voyage, and then, he assur'd me, he would go with me to America with all his Heart. near a Month, during which I enjoy'd his Company, which was the most entertaining that ever I met with in my life before.  In this time he let me into part of the Story of his own Life, which was indeed surprizing, and full of an infinite Variety, sufficient to fill up a much brighter History for its Adventures and Incidents, than any I ever saw in Print: But I shall have occasion to say more of him hereafter. he took his leave very unwillingly too, but Necessity oblig'd him, for his Reasons were very good, why he would not come to London, as I understood more fully afterwards. Secret, which was not to let him ever know my true Name, who I was, or where to be found; he likewise let me know how to write a Letter to him, so that he said he would be sure to receive it. to my old Lodgings; but for another nameless Reason took a private Lodging in St. John's-street, or as it is vulgarly call'd St. Jones's near Clarkenwell; and here being perfectly alone, I had leisure to sit down and reflect seriously upon the last seven Months Ramble I had made, for I had been abroad no less; the pleasant Hours I had with my last Husband I look'd back on with an infinite deal of Pleasure; but that Pleasure was very much lessen'd, when I found some time after that I was really with Child. where I should get leave to Lye-In; it being one of the nicest things in the World at that time of Day, for a Woman that was a Stranger, and had no Friends, to be entertain'd in that Circumstance without Security, which I had not, neither could I procure any. Friend at the Bank, or rather he took care to Correspond with me, for he wrote to me once a Week; and tho' I had not spent my Money so fast as to want any from him, yet I often wrote also to let him know I was alive; I had left Directions in Lancashire, so that I had these Letters, convey'd to me; and during my Recess at St Jones's I receiv'd a very obliging Letter from him, assuring me that his Process for a Divorce went on with Success, tho' he met with some Difficulties in it that he did not expect. he expected; for tho' I was in no condition to have had him yet, not being so foolish to marry him when I knew my self to be with Child by another Man, as some I know have ventur'd to do; yet I was not willing to lose him, and in a word, resolv'd to have him if he continu'd in the same mind, as soon as I was up again; for I saw apparently I should hear no more from my other Husband; and as he had all along press'd me to Marry, and had assur'd me he would not be at all disgusted at it, or ever offer to claim me again, so I made no scruple to resolve to do it if I could, and if my other Friend stood to his Bargain; and I had a great deal of Reason to be assur'd that he would, by the Letters he wrote to me, which were the kindest and most obliging that could be. take notice of it to me, and as far as Civility would allow, intimated that I must think of removing; this put me to extreme perplexity, and I grew very melancholly, for indeed I knew not what Course to take, I had Money, but no Friends, and was like now to have a Child upon my Hands to keep, which was a difficulty I had never had upon me yet, as my Story hitherto makes appear. encreas'd my Distemper; my Illness prov'd at length to be only an Ague but my Apprehensions were really that I should Miscarry; I should not say Apprehensions, for indeed I would have been glad to miscarry, but I cou'd never entertain so much as a thought of taking any thing to make me Miscarry, I abhorr'd, I say, so much as the thought of it. to send for a Midwife; I scrupled it at first, but after sometime consented, but told her I had no Acquaintancewith any Midwife, and so left it to her. Cases as mine was, as I thought at first she had been, as will appear presently, and she sent for a Midwife of the right sort, that is to say, the right sort for me. Midwife, but she had another Calling too, in which she was as expert as most Women, if not more: My Landlady had told her I was very Melancholly, and that she believ'd that had done me harm; and once, before me, said to her, Mrs. B--- I believe this Lady's Trouble is of a kind that is pretty much in your way, and therefore if you can do any thing for her, pray do, for she is a very civil Gentlewoman, and so she went out of the Room. seriously to explain what she meant, as soon as she was gone: Madam, says she, you seem not to understand what your Landlady means, and when you do, you need not let her know at all that you do so. Lying-In difficult to you, and that you are not willing to be expos'd; I need say no more, but to tell you, that if you think fit to communicate so much of your Case to me, as is necessary, for I do not desire to pry into those things, I perhaps may be in a Condition to assist you, and to make you easy, and remove all your dull Thoughts upon that Subject. new Spirit into my very Heart; my Blood began to circulate immediately, and I was quite another Body; I eat my Victuals again, and grew better presently after it: She said a great deal more to the same purpose, and then having press'd me to be free with her, and promis'd in the solemnest manner to be secret, she stop'd a little, as if waiting to see what Impression it made on me, and what I would say. Offer; I told her my Case was partly as she guess'd, and partly not, for I was really married, and had a Husband, tho' he was so remote at that time as that he cou'd not appear publickly. Ladies that came under her Care were married Women to her; every Woman, says she, that is with Child has a Father for it, and whether that Father was a Husband or no Husband, was no Business of hers; her Business was to assist me in my present Circumstances, whether I had a Husband or no; for, Madam, says she, to have a Husband that cannot appear, is to have no Husband, and therefore whether you are a Wife or a Mistress is all one to me. a Whore here, so I let that go; I told her, it was true as she said, but that however, if I must tell her my Case, I must tell it her as it was: So I related it as short as I could, and I concluded it to her: I trouble you with this, Madam, said I, not that, as you said before, it is much to the purpose in your Affair, but this is to the purpose, Namely, that I am not in any pain about being seen, or being conceal'd, for 'tis perfectly indifferent to me; but my difficulty is, that I have no Acquaintance in this part of the Nation. prevent the Parish Impertinences usual in such Cases; and perhaps, says she, do not know very well how to dispose of the Child when it comes; the last, says I, is not so much my Concern as the first: Well, Madam, answers the Midwife, dare you put your self into my Hands, I live in such a place, tho' I do not enquire after you, you may enquire after me, my Name is B--- I live in such a Street, naming the Street, at the Sign of the Cradle, my Profession is a Midwife, and I have many Ladies that come to my House to Lye- In; I have given Security to the Parish in General to secure them from any Charge, from what shall come into the World under my Roof; I have but one Question to ask in the whole Affair, Madam, says she, and if that be answer'd, you shall be entirely easy of the rest. understand you; I thank God, tho' I want Friends in this Part of the World, I do not want Money, so far as may be Necessary, tho' I do not abound in that neither: This I added, because I would not make her expect great things; well Madam, says she, that is the thing indeed, without which nothing can be done in these Cases; and yet, says she, you shall see that I will not impose upon you, or offer any thing that is unkind to you, and you shall know every thing before hand, that you may suit your self to the Occasion, and be either costly or sparing as you see fit. I told her, she seem'd to be so perfectly sensible of my Condition, that I had nothing to ask of her but this, that as I had Money sufficient, but not a great Quantity, she would order it so, that I might be at as little superfluous Charge as possible. it, in two or three Shapes.

No, not at all, said she, for where I have One of the third Sort, I have Two of the Second, and Four of the First, and I get as much by them in Proportion, as by any; but it you doubt my Care of you, I will allow any Friend you have to see if you are well waited on, or no. said she, I would have you observe, that here is three Months keeping you at but 10 s. a Week, I undertake to say you will not complain of my Table: I suppose, says she, you do not live Cheaper where you are now; No, indeed, said I, nor so Cheap, for I give six Shillings per Week for my Chamber, and find my own Dyet, which costs me a great deal more. happens, there is the Minister's Article saved; and if you have no Friends to come, you may save the Expence of a Supper; so that take those Articles out, Madam, says she, your Lying-In will not cost you above 5 l. 3 s more than your ordinary Charge of Living. told her I would come and be a Customer; but I told her also, that as I had two Months, and more to go, I might perhaps be obliged to stay longer with her than three Months, and desir'd to know if she would not be oblig'd to remove me before it was proper; No, she said, her House was large, and besides, she never put any Body to remove, that had Lain-In, till they were willng to go; and if she had more Ladies offer'd, she was not so ill belov'd among her Neighbours, but she could provide Accommodation for Twenty, if there was Occasion. put my self into her Hands: She then talk'd of other things, look'd about into my Accomodations, where I was, found fault with my wanting Attendance, and Conveniencies, and that I should not be us'd so at her House: I told her, I was shy of speaking for the Woman of the House look'd stranger, or at least I thought so, since I had been Ill, because I was with Child; and I was afraid she would put some Affront or other upon me, supposing that I had been able to give but a slight Account of my self. try'd to entertain Ladies in your Condition, but could not secure the Parish; and besides, such a nice Lady as you take her to be; however, since you are agoing you shall not meddle with her, but I'll see you are a little better look'd after while you are here, and it shall not cost you the more neither. Morning she sent me a Chicken roasted and hot, and a Bottle of Sherry, and ordered the Maid to tell me, that she was to wait on me every Day as long as I staid there. Night she sent to me again, to know if I wanted any thing, and to order the Maid to come to her in the Morning for Dinner; the Maid had Orders to make me some Chocolate in the Morning before she came away, and at Noon she brought me the Sweetbread of a Breast of Veal whole, and a Dish of Soup for my Dinner, and after this manner she nurs'd me up at a distance, so that I was mightily well pleased, and quickly well, for indeed my Dijections before were the principal Part of my Illness. sent me would have been some impudent brazen Wench of Drury Lane Breeding, and I was very uneasy upon that Account, so I would not let her lye in the House the first Night, but had my Eyes about me as narrowly as if she had been a publick Thief. with a short Note, that I might depend upon the honesty of her Maid; that she would be answerable for her upon all Accounts; and that she took no Servants without very good Security: I was then perfectly easy, and indeed the Maid's Behaviour spoke for its self, for a modester, quieter, sober Girl never came into any Body's Family, and I found her so afterwards.

Lodging at St. Jones's and went to my new Governess, for so they call'd her in the House, and there I was indeed treated with so much Courtisy, so carefully look'd to, and every thing so well, that I was surpris'd at it, and could not at first see what Advantage my Governess made of it; but I found afterwards that she profess'd to make no Profit of the Lodger's Dyet, nor indeed cou'd she get much by it, but that her Profit lay in the other Articles of her Management, and she made enough that way, I assure you; for 'tis scarce credible what Practice she had, as well Abroad as at Home, and yet all upon the private Account, or in plain English, the Whoring Account. twelve Ladies of Pleasure brought to Bed within Doors, and I think she had two and thirty, or thereabouts under her Conduct without Doors, whereof one, as nice as she was with me, was lodg'd with my old Landlady at St. Jones's. I had been my self, it shock'd my very Senses, I began to nauceate the place I was in, and above all, the Practice; and yet I must say that I never saw, or do I believe there was to be seen the least indecency in the House the whole time I was there. Ladies within their Month, nor then without the old Lady with them, who made it a piece of the Honour of her Management that no Man should touch a Woman, No, not his own Wife, within the Month; nor would she permit any Man to lye in the House upon any pretence whatever, No, not tho it was with his own Wife, and her saying for it was, that she car'd not how many Children was born in her House, but she would have none got there if she could help it. of the Right Hand if it was an Error, for by this she kept up the Reputation, such as it was, of her Business and obtain'd this Character, that tho' she did take Care of the Women when they were debauch'd yet she was not Instrumental to their being debauch'd at all, and yet it was a wicked Trade she drove too. from my Trustee at the Bank full of kind obliging things, and earnestly pressing me return to London: It was near a Fortnight old when it came to me, because it had first been sent into Lancashire, and then return'd to me; he concludes with telling me that he had obtain'd a Decree against his Wife, and that he would be ready to make good his Engagement to me, if I would accept of him, adding a great many Protestations of Kindness and Affection, such as he would have been far from offering if he had known the Circumstances I had been in, and which as it was I had been very far from deserving. it by a Messenger, alledging, that it came in cover to a Friend in Town; I gave him Joy of his Deliverance, but rais'd some Scruples at the Lawfulness of his Marrying again, and told him, I suppos'd he would consider very seriously upon that Point before he resolv'd on it, the Consequence being too great for a Man of his Judgment to venture rashly upon; so concluded wishing him very well in whatever he resolv'd, without letting him into any thing of my own Mind, or giving any Answer to his Proposal of my coming to London to him, but mention'd at a distance my Intention to return the latter end of the Year, this being dated in April. and my self in as good Condition as usual on such Occasions: My Governess did her part as a Midwife with the greatest Art and Dexterity imaginable, and far beyond all that ever I had had any Experience of before. she had been my own Mother it could not have been better; let none be encouraged in their loose Practices from this Dexterous Lady's Management, for she is gone to her place, and I dare say has left nothing behind her that can or will come up to it. another Letter from my Friend at the Bank, with the surprising News that he had obtain'd a final Sentence of Divorce against his Wife, and had serv'd her with it on such a Day, and that he had such an Answer to give to all my Scruples about his Marrying again, as I could not expect, and as he had no Desire of; for that his Wife, who had been under some Remorse before for her usage of him, as soon as she heard that he had gain'd his Point, had very unhappily destroy'd herself that same Evening. Disaster, but clear'd himself of having any hand in it, and that he had only done himself Justice in a Case in which he was notoriously Injur'd and Abus'd: However, he said that he was extremely afflicted at it, and had no view, of any. Satisfaction left in this World, but only in the hope that I would come and relieve him by my Company; and then he press'd me violently indeed to give him some hopes, that I would at least come up to Town and let him see me, when he would farther enter into Discourse about it. reflect on my Circumstances, and the inexpressible Misfortune it was to have a Child upon my Hands, and what to do in it I knew not; at last I open'd my Case at a distance to my Governess, I appear'd melancholy for several Days, and she lay at me continually to know what troubled me; I could not for my Life tell her that I had an offer of Marriage, after I had so often told her that I had a Husband, so that I really knew not what to say to her: I own'd I had something which very much troubl'd me, but at the same time told her I cou'd not speak of it to any one alive. her, for me to commit the Secret to any Body: This, instead of being an Answer to her, encreas'd her Importunities; she urg'd her having been trusted with the greatest Secrets of this Nature, that it was her business to Conceal every thing, and that to Discover things of that Nature would be her Ruin; she ask'd me if ever I had found her Tatling of other People's Affairs, and how could I suspect her? she told me, to unfold myself to her, was telling it to no Body; that she was silent as Death, that it must be a very strange Case indeed, that she could not help me out of; but to conceal it, was to deprive myself of all possible Help, or means of Help, and to deprive her of the Opportunity of Serving me.  In short, she had such a betwitching Eloquence, and so great a power of Perswasion, that there was no concealing any thing from her. Lancashire Marriage, and how both of us had been Disappointed; how we came together, and how we parted: How he Discharg'd me, as far as lay in him, and gave me free Liberty to Marry again, protesting that if he knew it he would never Claim me, or Disturb, or Expose me; that I thought I was free, but was dreadfully afraid to venture, for fear of the Consequences that might follow in case of a Discovery. inviting me to London, and with what Affection there were written, but blotted out the Name, and also the Story about the Dissaster of his Wife, only that she was dead. was no Marriage, but a Cheat on both Sides; and that as we were parted by mutual Consent, the nature of the Contract was destroy'd, and the Obligation was mutually discharg'd: She had Arguments for this at the tip of her Tongue; and in short, reason'd me out of my Reason; not but that it was too by the help of my own Inclination. she told me must be remov'd, and that so, as that it should never be possible for any one to discover it: I knew there was no Marrying without concealing that I had had a Child, for he would soon have discover'd by the Age of it, that it was born, nay, and gotten too, since my Parly with him, and that would have destroy'd all the Affair. Child, and for ought I knew, of having it murther'd, or starv'd by Neglect and Ill-usage, which was much the same, that I could not think of it, without Horror: I wish all those Women who consent to the disposing their Children out of the way, as it is call'd, for Decency sake, would consider that 'tis only a contriv'd Method for Murther; that is to say, killing their Children with safety. born into the World helpless, and uncapable either to supply our own Wants, or so much as make them known; and that without help, we must Perish; and this help requires not only an assisting Hand, whether of the Mother, or some Body else; but there are two Things necessary in that assisting Hand, that is, Care and Skill; without both which, half the Children that are born would die; nay, tho' they were not to be deny'd Food; and one half more of those that remain'd would be Cripples or Fools, loose their Limbs, and perhaps their Sense: I Question not, but that these are partly the Reasons why. Affection was plac'd by Nature in the Hearts of Mothers to their Children; without which they would never be able to give themselves up, as 'tis necessary they should, to the Care and waking Pains needful to the Support of Children. Murther them; again, to give them up to be Manag'd by those People, who have none of that needful Affection, plac'd by Nature in them, is to Neglect them in the highest Degree; nay, in some it goes farther, and is in order to their being Lost; so that 'tis an intentional Murther, whether the Child lives or dies. blackest and most frightful Form; and as I was very free with my Governness, who I had now learn'd to call Mother; I represented to her all the dark Thoughts which I had about it, and told her what distress I was in: She seem'd graver by much at this Part than at the other; but as she was harden'd in these things beyond all possibility of being touch'd with the Religious part, and the Scruples about the Murther; so she was equally impenetrable in that Part, which related to Affection: She ask'd me if she had not been Careful, and Tender of me in my Lying-Inn, as if I had been her own Child?  I told her I own'd she had. Well my Dear, says she, and when you are gone, what are you to me? and what would it be to me if you were to be Hang'd? Do you think there are not Women. who as it is their Trade, and they get their Bread by it, value themselves upon their being as careful of Children, as their own Mothers? Yes, yes, Child, says she, fear it not, How were we Nurs'd ourselves? Are you sure, you was Nurs'd up by your own Mother? and yet you look fat, and fair Child, says the old Beldam, and with that she stroak'd me over the Face; never be concern'd Child, says she, going on in her drolling way; I have no Murtherers about me, I employ the best Nurses that can be had; as have as few Children miscarry under their Hands, and there would, if they were all Nurs'd by Mothers; we want neither Care nor Skill. nurs'd by my own Mother; on the Contrary I was sure I was not; and I trembled, and look'd Pale at the very Expression; sure, said I, to my self, this Creature cannot be a Witch, or have any Conversation with a Spirit that can inform her what I was, before I was able to know it my self; and I look'd at her as if I had been frighted; but reflecting that it could not be possible for her to know any Thing about me, that went off, and I began to be easy, but it was not presently. so she run on in her wild Talk upon the Weakness, of my supposing that Children were murder'd, because they were not all nurs'd by the Mother; and to perswade me that the Children she disposed of, were as well used as if the Mothers had the Nursing of them themselves. strongly grounded; come then, says she, lets hear some of them: Why first, says I, you give a Piece of Money to these People to take the Child off the Parents Hands, and to take Care of it as long as it lives; now we know Mother, said I, that those are poor People, and their Gain consists in being quit of the Charge as soon as they can; how can I doubt but that, as it is best for them to have the Child die, they are not over Solicitous about its Life. upon the Child's Life, and they are as careful as any Mother of you all. look'd to, and have Justice done it, I should be happy; but it is impossible I can be satisfy'd in that Point, unless I saw it, and to see it would be Ruin and Destruction, as my Case now stands, so what to do I know not. not see the Child; you would be conceal'd and discover'd both together; these are things impossible, my Dear, and so you must e'n do as other conscientious Mothers have done before you; and be contented with things as they must be, tho' not as you wish them to be. conscientious Whores; but she was not willing to disoblige me, for really in this Case I was not a Whore, because legally Marry'd, the Force of my former Marriage excepted. Hardness, common to the Profession; I mean to be unnatural, and regardless of the Safety of my Child, and I preserv'd this honest Affection so long, that I was upon the Point of giving up my Friend at the Bank, who lay so hard at me to come to him, and Marry him, that there was hardly any Room to deny him. Dear, says she, I have found out a way, how you shall be at a Certainty, that your Child shall be used well, and yet the People that take Care of it, shall never know you. Well, says she, are you willing to beat some small Annual Expence, more than what we usually give to the People we contract with? Ay, says I, with all my Heart, provided I may be concealed; as to that, says she, you shall be secure, For the Nurse shall never dare to Enquire about you, and you shall once or twice a Year go with me and see your Child, and see how 'tis used, and be satisfy'd that it is in good Hands, no Body knowing who you are. able to conceal my being the Mother of it, do you think that possible? She shall be forbid to take any Notice; if she offers it, she shall lose the Money, which you are to be suppos'd to give her, and the Child be taken from her too. brought from Hertford, or thereabouts, who was to take the Child off our Hands entirely, for 10 l. in Money; but if I would allow 5 l. a Year more to her, she would be oblig'd to bring the Child to my Governesses House as often as we desir'd, or we should come down and, look at it, and see how well she used it. she had very good Cloaths and Linnen, and every thing well about her, and with a heavy Heart and many a Tear, I let her have my Child: I had been down at Hertford and look'd at her, and at her Dwelling, which I lik'd well enough; and I promised her great Things if she would be kind to the Child, so she knew at first Word that I was the Child's Mother; but she seem'd to be so much out of the Way; and to have no Room to enquire after me, that I thought I was safe enough, so in short, I consented to let her have the Child, and I gave her 10 l. that is to say I gave it to my Governess, who gave it the poor Woman before my Face, she agreeing never to return the Child back to me, or to clame any Thing more for its Keeping, or Bringing up; only that I promised, if she took a great deal of Care of it, I would give her some thing more as often as I came to see it; so that I was not bound to pay the 5 l. only that I promis'd my Governess I would do it: And thus my great Care was over, after a manner, which tho' it did not at all satisfy my Mind, yet was the most convenient for me, as my Affairs then stood, of any that could be thought off at that Time. and particularly about the Beginning of July I sent him a Letter, that I purpos'd to be in Town sometime in August; he return'd me an Answer in the most passionate Terms imaginable, and desir'd me to let him have timely Notice, and he would come and meet me two Days Journey: This puzzl'd me scurvily, and I did not know what Answer to make to it; once I was resolv'd to take the Stage Coach to West Chester, on Purpose only, to have the Satisfaction of coming back, that he might see me really come in the same Coach; for I had a jealous Thought, tho' I had no Ground for it at all, least he should think I was not really in the Country. Impression lay so strong on my Mind, that it was not to be resisted; at last it came as an Addition to my new Design of going into the Country, that it would be an excellent Blind to my old Governess, and would cover entirely all my other Affairs, for she did not know in the least, whether my new Lover liv'd in London, or, in Lancashire, and when I told her my Resolution, she was fully perswaded it was in Lancashire. Maid that tended me from the Beginning, to take a Place for me in the Coach; she would have had me let the Maid have waited on me down to the last Stage, and come up again in the Waggon, but I convinc'd her it would not be convenient; when I went away she told me, she would enter into no Measures for Correspondence, for she saw evidently that my Affection to my Child would cause me to write to her, and to Visit her too, when I came to Town again; I assur'd her it would, and so took my Leave, well satisfy'd, to have been freed from such a House, however, good my Accommodations there had been. call'd Stone, in Cheshire, where I not only had no manner of Business, but not the least Acquaintance with any Person in the Town: But I knew that with Money in the Pocket one is at Home any where; so I lodg'd there two or three Days, 'till watching my Opportunity, I found Room in another Stage Coach, and took Passage back again for London, sending a Letter to my Gentleman, that I should be such a certain Day at Stony-Stratford where the Coachman told me he was to Lodge. hired on Purpose to carry some Gentlemen to West-Chester, who were going for Ireland, was now returning, and did not tye it self up to exact Times or Places, as the Stages did, so that having been oblgi'd to lye still on Sunday, he had Time to get himself ready to come out, which otherwise he could not have done. enough to be with me at Night, but he met me at a Place call'd Brickill the next Morning, just as we were coming into the Town. disappointed over Night: He pleas'd me doubly too by the Figure he came in, for he brought a very handsome (Gentleman's) Coach, and four Horses, with a Servant to attend him. Brickill, and putting into the same Inn, he set up his own Coach, and bespoke his Dinner; I ask'd him what he meant by that, for I was for going forward with the Journey; he said, no, I had need of a little Rest upon the Road, and that was a very good sort of a House, tho' it was but a little Town; so we would go no farther that Night, what ever came of it. himself to so much Expence, it was but reasonable I should oblige him a little too, so I was easy, as to that Point. Fields, and the Country as is usual for Strangers to do, and our Landlord was our Guide in going to see the Church; I observ'd my Gentleman enquir'd pretty much about the Parson, and I took the hint immediately, that he certainly would propose to be married; and it follow'd presently, that in short, I would not refuse him; for to be plain with my Circumstances, I was in no condition now to say NO, I had no reason now to run any more such hazards. few Moments, I observ'd my Landlord took him aside and whisper'd to him, tho' not very softly neither, for so much I over-heard, Sir, if you shall have occasion \--- the rest I cou'd not hear, but it seems it was to this purpose, Sir, if you shall have occasion for a Minister, I have a Friend a little way off that will serve you, and be as private as you please; my Gentleman answer'd loud enough for me to hear, very well, I believe I shall. irresistable Words, that since he had had the good Fortune to meet me, and every thing concurr'd, it wou'd be hastening his Felicity if I would put and end to the matter just there; what do you mean, says I, colouring a little, what in an Inn, and on the Road! Bless us all, said I, how can you talk so! O I can talk so very well, says he, I came on purpose to talk so, and I'll show you that I did, and with that he pulls out a great Bundle of Papers; you fright me said I, what are all these? don't be frighted, my Dear, said he, and kiss'd me, this was the first time that be had been so free to call me my Dear; then he repeated it, don't be frighted, you shall see what it is all, then he laid them all abroad; there was first the Deed or Sentence of Divorce from his Wife, and the full Evidence of her playing the Whore; then there was the Certificates of the Minister and Church-wardens of the Parish where she liv'd, proving that she was buried, and intimating the manner of her Death; the Copy of the Coroner's Warrant for a Jury to sit upon her, and the Verdict of the Jury, who brought it in Non Compos Mentis; all this was to give me Satisfaction, tho', by the way, I was not so scrupulous, had he known all, but that I might have taken him without it: However, I look'd them all over as well as I cou'd, and told him, that this was all very clear indeed, but that he need not have brought them out with him, for it was time enough: Well, he said, it might be time enough for me, but no time but the present time was time enough for him. Ay, says he, that's the Question I wanted to have you ask me; so he takes out a little Chagreen Case, and gives me out of it a very fine Diamond Ring; I could not refuse it, if I had a mind to do so, for he put it upon my Finger; so I only made him a Curtsy, then he takes out another Ring, and this, says he, is for another Occasion, and puts that into his Pocket: Well, but let me see it tho', says I, and smil'd, I guess what it is, I think you are Mad: I should have been Mad if I had done less, says he, and still he did not show it me, and I had a great mind to see it; so I says, well but let me see it; hold, says he, first look here, then he took up the Roll again, and read it, and behold! it was a License for us to be married: Why, says I, are you Distracted? you were fully satisfy'd sure that I would yield at first Word, or resolv'd to take no denial; the last is certainly the Case, said he; but you may be mistaken, said I; no, no, says he, I must not be denied, I can't be denied, and with that he fell to Kissing me so violently, I could not get rid of him. the Discourse, at last, he takes me by surprize in his Arms, and threw me on the Bed and himself with me, and holding me still fast in his Arms, but without the least offer of any Undecency, Courted me to Consent with such repeated Entreaties and Arguments; protesting his Affection and vowing he would not let me go, till I had promised him, that at last I said, why you resolve not to be deny'd indeed, I think: No, no, says he, I must not be deny'd, I won't be deny'd, I can't be deny'd: Well, well, said I, and giving him a slight Kiss, then you shan't be deny'd, let me get up. began to think Once, he took it for a Marriage, and would not stay for the Form; but I wrong'd him, for he took me by the Hand, pull'd me up again, and then giving me two or three Kisses, thank'd me for my kind yielding to him; and was so overcome with the Satsifaction of it, that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes. leave to retire a little to my chamber: If I had a Grain of true Repentance for an abominable Life of 24 Years past, it was then. O! what a felicity is it to Mankind, said I, to myself, that they cannot see into the Hearts of one another! How happy had it been, if I had been Wife to a Man of so much Honesty, and so much Affection from the Beginning? innocent Gentleman going to be abus'd by me! How little does he think, that having Divorc'd a Whore, he is throwing himself into the Arms of another! that he is going to Marry one that has lain with two Brothers, and has had three Children by her own Brother! one that was born in Newgate, whose Mother was a Whore, and is now a transported Thief; one that has lain with thirteen Men, and has had a Child since he saw me! poor Gentleman! said I, What he is going to do?  After this reproaching myself was over, it followed thus: Well, if I must be his Wife, if it please God to give me Grace, I'll be a true Wife to him, and love him suitably to the strange Excess of his Passion for me; I will make him amends, by what he shall see, for the Abuses I put upon him, which he does not see. went down Stairs, and talk'd with my Landlord about the Parson. Clergy Man; and when my Gentleman began to speak to him, of sending for him, Sir, says he to him, my Friend is in the House; so without any more words he brought them together: When he came to the Minister, he ask'd him if he would venture to marry a couple of Strangers that were both willing? The Parson said that Mr. --- had said something to him of it; that he hop'd it was no Clandestine Business; that he seem'd to be a grave Gentleman, and he suppos'd Madam was not a Girl, so that the consent of Friends should be wanted; to put you out of doubt of that, says my Gentleman, read this Paper, and out he pulls the License; I am satisfy'd, says the Minister, where is the Lady? you shall see her presently, says my Gentleman. of my Room, so he tells me the Minister was below, and that upon showing him the License, he was free to marry us with all his Heart, but he asks to see you, so he ask'd if I would let him come up. Dear, he seem'd to scruple whether it was not some young Girl stolen from her Parents, and I assur'd him we were both of Age to command our own Consent; and that made him ask to see you; well, said I, do as you please; so up they brings the Parson, and a merry good sort of Gentleman he was; he had been told, it seems, that we had met there by accident, that I came in a Chester Coach, and my Gentleman in his own Coach to meet me; that we were to have met last Night at Stony Stratford, but that he could not reach so far: Well, Sir, says the Parson, every ill turn has some good in it; the Disappointment, Sir, says he to my Gentleman, was yours, and the good Turn is mine, for if you had met at Stony Stratford I had not had the Honour to Marry you: Landlord have you a Common-Prayer Book. to marry in an Inn, and at Night too! Madam, says the Minister, if you will have it be in the Church you shall; but I assure you your Marriage will be as firm here as in the Church; we are not tyed by the Canons to Marry no where but in the Church; and as for the time of Day, it does not at all weigh in this Case, our Princes are married in their Chambers, and at Eight or Ten a Clock at Night. willing at all to be married but in the Church; but it was all Grimace; so I seem'd at last to be prevail'd on, and my Landlord, and his Wife, and Daughter, were call'd up: My Landlord was Father and Clark and all together, and we were married, and very Merry we were; tho' I confess the self- reproaches which I had upon me before, lay close to me, and extorted every now and then a deep sigh from me, which my Bridegroom took notice of, and endeavour'd to encourage me, thinking, poor Man, that I had some Little hesitations at the Step I had taken so hastily. private in the Inn, that not a Servant in the House knew of it, for my Landlady and her Daughter waited on me, and would not let any of the Maids come up Stairs.  My Landlady's Daughter I call'd my Bride-Maid; and sending for a Shopkeeper the next Morning, I gave the young Woman a good Suit of Knots, as good as the Town would afford, and finding it was a Lacemaking Town, I gave her Mother a Piece of Bone lace for a Head. Minister of the Parish should hear of it; but for all that somebody heard of it, so as that we had the Bells set a Ringing the next Morning early, and the Musick, such as the Town would afford, under our Window; but my Landlord brazen'd it out, that we were marry'd before we came thither, only that being his former Guess, we would have our Wedding Supper at his House. been disturb'd by the Bells in the Morning, and having perhaps not slept over much before, we were so sleepy afterwards that we lay in Bed till almost Twelve a Clock. ringing of Bells, and she manag'd it so well that we were very quiet: But an odd Passage interrupted all my Mirth for a good while; the great Room of the House look'd into the Street, and I had walk'd to the End of the Room, and it being a pleasant warm Day, I had open'd the Window, and was standing at it for some Air, when I saw three Gentlemen ride by, and go into an Inn just against us. but the second of the three, was my Lancashire Husband: I was frighted to Death, I never was in such a Consternation in my Life, I thought I should have sunk into the Ground, my Blood run chill in my Veins, and I trembl'd as if I had been in a cold fit of an Ague: I say, there was no room to question the Truth of it, I knew his Cloaths, I knew his Horse, and I knew his Face. Disorder, and that I was very glad of: The Gentlemen had not been long in the House but they came to the Window of their Room, as is usual; but my Window was shut you may be sure: However, I could not keep from peeping at them, and there I saw him again, heard him call to one of the Servants for something he wanted, and receiv'd all the terrifying Confirmations of its being the same Person, that were possible to be had. impossible; sometimes my Imagination form'd an Idea of one frightful thing, sometimes of another; sometimes I thought he had discover'd me, and was come to upbraid me with Ingratitude and Breach of Honour; then I fancied he was coming up Stairs to insult me; and innumerable Thoughts came into my Head, of what was never in his Head, nor ever could be, unless the Devil had reveal'd it to him. the Window or Door of the Inn, where they were: At last hearing a great clutter in the Passage of their Inn, I run to the Window, and, to my great Satisfaction, I saw them all three go out again and travel on Westward; had they gone towards London, I should have been still in a Fright, least I should meet him again, and that he should know me; but he went the contrary way, and so I was eas'd of that Disorder. were alarm'd with a great Uproar in the Street, and People riding as if they had been out of their Wits, and what was it but a Hue and Cry after three Highway Men, that had rob'd two Coaches, and some Travellers near Dunstable Hill, and notice had, it seems, been given, that they had been seen at Brickill at such a House, meaning the House where those Gentlemen had been. enough that the Gentlemen had been gone above three Hours; the Crowd having gathered about, we had the News presently; and I was heartily concern'd now another way: I presently told the People of the House, that I durst say those were honest Persons, for that I knew one of the Gentlemen to be a very honest Person, and of a good Estate in Lancashire. this, and came over to me to be satisfy'd from my own Mouth, and I assur'd him that I saw the three Gentlemen as I was at the Window, that I saw them afterwards at the Windows of the Room they din'd in; that I saw them take Horse, and I would assure him I knew one of them to be such a Man, that he was a Gentleman of a very good Estate, and an undoubted Character in Lancashire, from whence I was just now upon my Journey. and gave the Constable such Satisfaction, that he immediately sounded a Retreat, told his People these were not the Men, but that he had an account they were very honest Gentlemen, and so they went all back again; what the Truth of the matter was I knew not, but certain it was that the Coaches were rob'd at Dunstable Hill, and 560 l. in Money taken, besides some of the Lace Merchants that always Travel that way had been visited too; as to the three Gentlemen, that he remains to be explain'd hereafter. always safest Travelling after a Robbery, for that the Thieves were sure to be gone far enough off when they had allarm'd the Country; but I was uneasy, and indeed principally least my old Acquaintance should be upon the Road still, and should chance to see me. all this while, and my new Spouse strove to make me easie in every thing: O could this State of Life have continu'd! how had all my past Troubles been forgot, and my future Sorrows been avoided? but I had a past life of a most wretched kind to account for, some of it in this World as well as in another. mounted himself, his Son and three honest Country Fellows with good Fire-Arms, and, without telling us of it, follow'd the Coach, and would see us safe into Dunstable; we could do no less than treat them very handsomely at Dunstable, which Cost my Spouse about Ten or Twelve Shillings, and something he gave the Men for their Time too, but my Landlord would take nothing for himself. had I come to London unmarried, I must either have come to him for the first Night's Entertainment, or have discovered to him that I had not one Acquaintance in the whole City of London, that could receive a poor Bride for the first Night's Lodging with her Spouse: But now I made no scruple of going directly home with him, and there I took Possession at once of a House well Furnished, and a Husband in very good Circumstances, so that I had a prospect of a very happy Life, if I knew how to manage it; and I had leisure to consider of the real Value of the Life I was likely to live; how different it was to be from the loose part I had acted before, and how much happier a Life of Virtue and Sobriety is, than that which we call a Life of Pleasure. I enjoy'd it, to have tasted the true sweetness of it, and had I not fallen into that Poverty which is the sure Bane of Virtue, how happy had I been, not only here, but perhaps for ever? for while I liv'd thus, I was really a Penitent for all my Life pass'd, I look'd back on it with Abhorrence, and might truly be said to hate my self for it; I often reflected how my Lover at the Bath, strook by the Hand of God, repented and abandon'd me, and refus'd to see me any more, tho' he lov'd me to an extreme; but I, prompted by that worst of Devils, Poverty, return'd to the vile Practice, and made the Advantage of what they call a handsome Face, be the Relief to my Necessities, and Beauty be a Pimp to Vice. past was at an end; and I began to be thankful for my Deliverance; I sat many an Hour by my self, and wept over the Remembrance of past Follies, and the dreadful Extravagances of a wicked Life, and sometimes I flatter'd my self that I had sincerely repented. resist; and few know what would be their Case, if driven to the same Exigences: As Covetousness is the Root of all Evil, so Poverty is, the worst of all Snares: But I wave that Discourse till I come to the Experiment. Sensible, Sober Man, Virtuous, Modest, Sincere, and in his Business Diligent and Just: His Business was in a narrow Compass; and his Income sufficient to a plentiful way of Living in the ordinary way; I do not say to keep an Equipage, and make a Figure as the World calls it, nor did I expect it, or desire it; for as I abhorred the Levity and Extravagance of my former Life, so I chose now to live retir'd, frugal, and within ourselves; I kept no Company, made no Visits; minded my Family, and oblig'd my Husband; and this kind of Life became a Pleasure to me. when a sudden Blow from an almost invisible Hand, blasted all my happiness, and turn'd me out into the World in a Condition the reverse of all that had been before it. too much for our Fortunes to bear the Loss of, the Clark fail'd, and the Loss fell very heavy on my Husband, yet it was not so great, but that if he had had Courage to have look'd his Misfortunes in the Face, his Credit was so good, that as I told him, he would easily recover it; for to sink under Trouble is to double the Weight, and he that will Die in it, shall Die in it. it was a Stab that touch'd the Vitals, he grew Melancholy and Disconsolate, and from thence Lethargick, and died; I foresaw the Blow, and was extremely oppress'd in my Mind, for I saw evidently that if he died I was undone. to leave bearing Children, for I was now Eight and Forty, and I suppose if he had liv'd I should have had no more. things worse than ever: First it was past the flourishing time with me when I might expect to be courted for a Mistress; that agreeable part had declin'd some time, and the Ruins only appear'd of what had been; and that which was worse than all was this, that I was the most dejected, disconsolate Creature alive; I that had encourag'd my Husband, and endeavour'd to support his Spirits under his Trouble could not support my own; I wanted that Spirit in trouble which I told him was so necessary for bearing the burthen. Helpless, and the Loss my Husband had substain'd had reduc'd his Circumstances so low, that tho' indeed I was not in Debt, yet I could easily foresee that what was left would not support me long; that it wasted daily for Subsistence, so that it would be soon all spent, and then I saw nothing before me but the utmost Distress, and this represented it self so lively to my Thoughts, that it seem'd as if it was come, before it was really very near; also my very Apprehensions doubl'd the Misery, for I fancied every Sixpence that I paid for a Loaf of Bread, was the last I had in the World, and that To-morrow I was to fast, and be starv'd to Death! sat and cried and tormented myself Night and Day; wringing my Hands, and sometimes raving like a distracted Woman; and indeed I have often wonder'd it had not affected my Reason, for I had the Vapours to such a degree, that my Understanding was sometimes quite lost in Fancies and Imaginations. weeping continually over my dismal Circumstances, and as it were only bleeding to Death, without the least hope or prospect of help; and now I had cried so long, and so often, that Tears were exhausted, and I began to be Desperate, for I grew poor a pace. reducing my Living so, I sold off most of my Goods, which put a little Money in my Pocket, and I liv'd near a Year upon that, spending very sparingly, and eeking things out to the utmost; but still when I look'd before me, my Heart would sink within me at the ineviable approach of Misery and Want: O let none read this part without seriously reflecting on the Circumstances of a desolate State, and how they would grapple with want of Friends and want of Bread; it will certainly make them think not of sparing what they have only, but of looking up to Heaven for support, and of the wise Man's Prayer, Give me not Poverty least I steal. Temptation, and all the Strength to resist is taken away; Poverty presses, the Soul is made Desparate by Distress, and what can be done? It was one Evening, when being brought, as I may say, to the last Gasp, I think I may truly say I was Distracted and Raving, when prompted by I know not what Spirit, and as it were, doing I did not know what, or why; I dress'd me, for I had still pretty good Cloaths, and went out: I am very sure I had no manner of Design in my Head, when I went out, I neither knew or considered where to go, or on what Business; but as the Devil carried me out and laid his Bait for me, so he brought me to be sure to the place, for I knew not whether I was going or what I did. in Leadenhall-street, where I saw lye on a Stool just before the Compter a little Bundle wrapt in a white Cloth, beyond it, stood a Maid Servant with her Back to it, looking up towards the top of the Shop, where the Apothecary's Apprentice, as I suppose, was standing up on the Compter, with his Back also to the Door, and a Candle in his Hand, looking and reaching up to the upper Shelf for something he wanted, so that both were engag'd, and no Body else in the Shop. had spoke, for I remember, and shall never forget it, 'twas like a Voice spoken over my Shoulder, take the Bundle; be quick; do it this Moment; it was no sooner said but I step'd into the Shop, and with my Back to the Wench, as if I had stood up for a Cart that was going by, I put my Hand behind me and took the Bundle, and went off with it, the Maid or Fellow not perceiving me, or any one else. When I went way I had no Heart to run, or scarce to mend my pace; I cross'd the Street indeed, and went down the first turning I came to, and I think it was a Street that went thro' into Fenchurch-street, from thence I crossed and turn'd thro' so many ways and turnings, that I could never tell which way it was, nor where I went, I felt not the Ground I stept on, and the farther I was out of Danger, the faster I went, till tyr'd and out of Breath, I was forc'd to sit down on a little Bench at a Door, and then found I was got into Thames-street near Billingsgate: I rested me a little and went on, my Blood was all in a Fire, my Heart beat as if I was in a sudden Fright: In short, I was under such a Surprize that I knew not whether I was a going, or what to do. eagerly, I began to consider and make home to my Lodging, where I came about Nine a Clock at Night. it, I knew not, but when I came to open it, I found there was a Suit of Child- bed Linnen in it, very good and almost new, the Lace very fine; there was a Silver Porringer of a Pint, a small Silver Mug and Six Spoons, with some other Linnen, a good Smock, and Three Silk Handkerchiefs, and in the Mug in a Paper Eighteen Shillings and Six-pence in Money. Impressions of Fear, and in such Terror of Mind, tho' I was perfectly safe, that I cannot express the manner of it; I sat me down and cried most vehemently; Lord, said I, what am I now? a Thief! why I shall be taken next time and be carried to Newgate and be Try'd for my Life! and with that I cry'd again a long time, and I am sure, as poor as I was, if I had durst for fear, I would certainly have carried the Things back again; but that went off after a while: Well, I went to Bed for that Night, but slept little, the Horror of the Fact was upon my Mind, and, I knew not what I said or did all Night, and all the next Day: Then I was impatient to hear some News of the Loss; and would fain know how it was, whether they were a Poor Bodies Goods, or a Rich; perhaps, said I, it may be some poor Widow like me, that had pack'd up these Goods to go and sell them for a little Bread for herself and a poor Child, and are now starving and breaking their Hearts, for want of that little they would have fetch'd, and this Thought tormented me worse than all the rest, for three or four Days. my own Starving, which grew every Day more frightful to me, harden'd my Heart by degrees; it was then particularly heavy upon my Mind, that I had been reform'd, and had, as I hop'd, repented of all my pass'd wickednesses; that I had liv'd a sober, grave, retir'd Life for several Years, but now I should be driven by the dreadful Necessity of my Circumstances to the Gates of Destruction, Soul and Body; and two or three times I fell upon my Knees, praying to God, as well as I could, for Deliverance; but I cannot but say, my Prayers had no hope in them; I knew not what to do, it was all Fear without, and Dark within; and I reflected on my pass'd Life as not repented of, that Heaven was now beginning to punish me, and would make me as miserable as I had been wicked? Counsellor within, and he was continually prompting me to relieve my self by the worst means; so one Evening he tempted me again by the same wicked Impulse that had said, take that Bundle, to go out again and seek for what might happen. search of I knew not what, when the Devil put a Snare in my way of a dreadful Nature indeed, and such a one as I have never had before or since; going thro' Aldersgate-street, there was a pretty little Child had been at a Dancing- School, and was a going home all alone, and my Prompter, like a true Devil, set me upon this innocent Creature; I talk'd to it, and it prattl'd to me again, and I took it by the Hand and led it a long till I came to a pav'd Alley that goes into Bartholomew-Close, and I led it in there; the Child said that was not its way home; I said, yes, my Dear it is, I'll show you the way home; the Child had a little Necklace on of Gold Beads, and I had my Eye upon that, and in the dark of the Alley I stoop'd, pretending to mend the Child's Clog that was loose, and took off her Necklace and the Child never felt it, and so led the Child on again: Here, I say, the Devil put me upon killing the Child in the dark Alley, that it might not Cry, but the very thought frighted me so that I was ready to drop down, but I turn'd the Child about and bad it go back again, for that was not its way home; the Child said so she would, and I went thro' into Bartholomew-Close, and then turn'd round to another Passage that goes into Long-lane, so away in Charterhouse- Yard, and out into St. John's-street, then crossing into Smithfield, went down Chick-lane, and into Field lane to Holbourn-bridge, when mixing with the Crowd of People usually passing there, it was not possible to have been found out; and thus I made my second Sally into the World. Reflections I had made wore quickly off; Poverty, harden'd my Heart, and my own Necessities made me regardless of any thing: The last Affair left no great Concern upon me, for as I did the poor Child no harm, I only thought, I had given the Parents a just Reproof for their negligence, in leaving the poor Lamb to come home by it self, and it would teach them to take more Care another time. it might have been formerly the Mother's, for it was too big for the Child's wear, but that, perhaps, the Vanity of the Mother to have her Child look Fine at the Dancing School, had made her let the Child wear it, and no doubt the Child had a Maid sent to take care of it, but she, like a careless Jade, was taken up perhaps with some Fellow that had met her, and so the poor Baby wandred till it fell into my Hands. had a great many tender Thoughts about me yet, and did nothing but what, as I may say, meer Necessity drove me to. and did not know how to manage, otherwise than as the Devil put things into my Head; and indeed he was seldom backward to me: One Adventure I had which was very lucky to me; I was going thro' Lombard street in the dusk of the Evening, just by the end of Three King Court, when on a sudden comes a Fellow running by me as swift as Lightning, and throws a Bundle that was in his Hand just behind me, as I stood up against the corner of the House at the turning into the Alley; just as he threw it in, he said, God bless you Mistress let it lie there a little, and away he runs: After him comes two more, and immediately a young Fellow without his Hat, crying stop Thief, they persued the two last Fellows so close, that they were forc'd to drop what they had got, and one of them was taken into the bargain, the other got off free. Fellow they had taken, and lugging the Things they had found, extremely well satisfied that they had recovered the Booty, and taken the Thief; and thus they pass'd by me, for I look'd only like one who stood up while the Crowd was gone. answering me, and I was not very importunate; but after the Crowd was wholly pass'd, I took my opportunity to turn about and take up what was behind me and walk away: This indeed I did with less Disturbance than I had done formerly, for these things I did not steal, but they were stolen to my Hand: I got safe to my Lodgings with this Cargo, which was a Peice of fine black Lustring Silk, and a Peice of Velvet; the latter was but part of a Peice of about a 11 Yards; the former was a whole Peice of near 50 Yards; it seems it was a Mercer's Shop that they had rifl'd; I say, rifled, because the Goods were so considerable that they had Lost; for the Goods that they Recover'd were pretty many, and I believe came to about six or seven several Peices of Silk: How they came to get so many I could not tell; but as I had only robb'd the Thief, I made no scruple at taking these Goods, and being very glad of them too. with but small Purchase, yet with good Success, but I went in daily dread that some mischief would befal me, and that I should certainly come to be hang'd at last: The impression this made on me was too strong to be slighted, and it kept me from making attempts, that for ought I knew might have been very safely perform'd; but one thing I cannot omit, which was a Bait to me many a Day. I walk'd frequently out into the Villages round the Town to see if nothing would fall in my Way there; and going by a House near Stepney, I saw on the Window-board two Rings, one a small Diamond Ring, and the other a plain Gold Ring, to be sure laid there by some thoughtless Lady, that had more Money than Forecast, perhaps only till she wash'd her Hands. there was any Body in the Room or no, and I could see no Body, but still I was not sure; it came presently into my Thoughts to rap at the Glass, as if I wanted to speak with some Body, and if any Body was there they would be sure to come to the Window, and then I would tell them to remove those Rings, for that I had seen two suspicious Fellows take notice of them: This was a ready Thought, I rapt once or twice and no Body came, when I thrust hard against the Square of Glass, and broke it with little Noise, and took out the two Rings, and walk'd away, the Diamond Ring was worth about 3 l. and the other about 9 s. Peices of Silk, I was very loth to dispose of them for a Trifle; as the poor unhappy Thieves in general do, who after they have ventur'd their Lives for, perhaps a thing of Value, are forc'd to sell it for a Song when they have done; but I was resolv'd I would not do thus whatever Shift I made; however, I did not well know what Course to take: At last I resolv'd to go to my old Governess, and acquaint my self with her again: I had punctually supply'd the 5 l. a Year to her for my little Boy as long I was able; but at last was oblig'd to put a stop to it: However, I had written a Letter to her, wherein I had told her that my Circumstances were reduc'd; that I had lost my Husband, and that I was not able to do it any longer, and beg'd the poor Child might not suffer too much for its Mother's Misfortunes. Trade still, but that she was not in such flourishing Circumstances as before; for she had been Sued by a certain Gentleman, who had had his Daughter stolen from him; and who it seems she had helped to convey away; and it was very narrowly that she escap'd the Gallows; the Expence also had ravag'd her, so that her House was but meanly Furnished, and she was not in such repute for her Practice as before; however, she stood upon her Legs, as they say, and as she was a bustling Woman, and had some Stock left, she was turn'd Pawn Broker, and liv'd pretty well. she would not have the less respect for me, for my being reduc'd; that she had taken Care my Boy was very well look'd after, tho' I could not pay for him, and that the Woman that had him was easie, so that I needed not to Trouble myself about him, till I might be better able to do it effectually. Monies worth, if she could tell me how I might turn them into Money; she ask'd what it was I had?  I pull'd out the string of gold Beads, and told her it was one of my Husband's Presents to me; then I show'd her the two Parcels of Silk which I told her I had from Ireland, and brought up to Town with me; and the little Diamond Ring; as to the small Parcel of Plate and Spoons, I had found means to dispose of them my self before; and as for the Childbed Linnen I had, she offer'd me to take it her self, believing it to have been my own; she told me that she was turn'd Pawn-Broker, and that she would sell those things for me as pawn'd to her, and so she sent presently for proper Agents that bought them, being in her Hands, without any scruple, and gave good Prizes too. Condition to some Business; for I would gladly have turn'd my Hand to any honest Employment if I could have got it; but honest Business did not come within her reach; if I had been younger, perhaps she might have helped me, but my Thoughts were off of that kind of Livelihood, as being quite out of the way after 50, which was my Case, and so I told her. something to do, and it should cost me very little, and this I gladly accepted of; and now living a little easier, I enter'd into some Measures to have my little Son by my last Husband taken off; and this she made easie too, reserving a Payment only of 5 l. a Year, if I could pay it, This was such a help to me, that for a good while I left off the wicked Trade that I had so newly taken up; and gladly I would have got Work but that was very hard to do for one that had no Acquaintance. the like; and this I lik'd very well and work'd very hard, and with this I began to live; but the diligent Devil who resolv'd I should continue in his Service, continually prompted me to go out and take a Walk, that is to say, to see if any thing would offer in the old Way. the Streets, but met with no purchase; but not content with that, I went out the next Evening too, when going by an Alehouse I saw the Door of a little room open, next the very Street, and on the Table a silver Tankard, things much in use in publick Houses at that time; it seems some Company had been drinking there, and the careless Boys had forgot to take it away. of the Bench, I sat down before it, and knock'd with my Foot, a Boy came presently, and I bad him fetch me a pint of warm Ale, for it was cold Weather; the Boy run, and I heard him go down the Cellar to draw the Ale; while the Boy was gone, another Boy come, and cried, d' ye call, I spoke with a melancholly Air, and said, no, the Boy is gone for a Pint of Ale for me. the Five, which was the Box I sat in, and the Boy said yes; who fetch'd the Tankard, away? says the Woman, I did, says another Boy, that's it, pointing it seems to another Tankard, which he had fetch'd from another Box by Mistake; or else it must be, that the Rogue forgot that he had not brought it in, which certainly he had not. Tankard was not mist, and yet they concluded it was fetch'd away; so I drank my Ale, call'd to Pay, and as I went away, I said, take care of your Plate Child, meaning a silver pint Mug, which he brought me to Drink in; the Boy said, yes Madam: very welcome, and away I came. that if I might be put to the Necessity of being expos'd she might offer me some assistance; when I had been at Home some time, and had an opportunity of Talking to her, I told her I had a Secret of the greatest Consequence in the World to commit to her, if she had respect enough for me to keep it a Secret: She told me she had kept one of my Secrets faithfully; why should I doubt her keeping another? I told her the strangest thing in the World had befallen me, even without any design; and so told her the whole Story of the Tankard: And have you brought it away with you my Dear, says she, to be sure I have, says I, and shew'd it her. But what shall I do now, says I, must not I carry it again? I, they can't be so base to stop me, when I carry it to them again? You don't know those Sort of People Child, says she, they'll not only carry you to Newgate, but hang you too without any regard to the honesty of returning it; or bring in an Account of all the other Tankards as they have lost for you to pay for: What must I do then? says I; Nay, says she, as you have plaid the cunning part and stole it, you must e'n keep it, there's no going back now; besides Child, says she, Don't you wan't it more than they do? I wish you cou'd light of such a Bargain once a Week. Pawn-Broker, she had a Sort of People about her, that were none of the honest ones that I had met with there before. for every now and then I saw Hilts of Swords, Spoons, Forks, Tankards, and all such kind of Ware brought in, not to be Pawn'd, but to be sold down right; and she bought them all without asking any Questions, but had good Bargains as I found by her Discourse. Plate she bought, that it might not be challeng'd; and she came to me and told me one Morning that she was going to Melt, and if I would, she would put my Tankard in, that it might not be seen by any Body; I told her with all my Heart; so she weigh'd it, and allow'd me the full value in Silver again; but I found she did not do so to the rest of her Customers. ask me what the Matter was? I told her my Heart was very heavy, I had little Work, and nothing to live on, and knew not what Course to take; she Laugh'd and told me I must go out again and try my Fortune; it might be that I might meet with another Peice of Plate. O, Mother! says I, that is a Trade that I have no skill in, and if I should be taken I am undone at once; says she, I could help you to a School-Mistress, that shall make you as dexterous as her self: I trembled at that Proposal, for hitherto I had had no Confederates, nor any Acquaintance among that Tribe; but she conquer'd all my Modesty, and all my Fears; and in a little time, by the help of this Confederate I grew as impudent a Thief, and as dexterous as ever Moll Cut-Purse was, tho' if Fame does not belie her, not half so Handsome. Shop-lifting, stealing of Shop-Books, and Pocket Books, and taking off Gold Watches from the Ladies Sides, and this last she did so dexteriously that no Woman ever arriv'd to the Perfection of that Art, like her: I lik'd the first and the last of these things very well, and I attended her some time in the Practise, just as a Deputy attends a Midwife without any Pay. several times unhook'd a Watch from her own Side with great dexterity; at last she show'd me a Prize, and this was a young Lady with Child who had a charming Watch, the thing was to be done as she came out of the Church; she goes on one side of the Lady, and pretends, just as she came to the Steps, to fall, and fell against the Lady with so much violence as put her into a great fright, and both cry'd out terribly; in the very moment that she jostl'd the Lady, I had hold of the Watch, and holding it the right way, the start she gave drew the Hook out and she never felt it; I made off immediately, and left my School-Mistress to come out of her Fright gradually, and the Lady too; and presently the Watch was miss'd; ay, says my Comrade, then it was those Rogues that thrust me down, I warrant ye; I wonder the Gentlewoman did not miss her Watch before, then we might have taken them. home a full Hour before her: This was my first Adventure in Company; the Watch was indeed a very fine one, and had many Trinkets about it, and my Governess allow'd us 20 l. for it, of which I had half, and thus I was enter'd a compleat Thief, harden'd to a Pitch above all the Reflections of Conscience or Modesty, and to a Degree which I never thought possible in me. me into this Wickedness, brought me on to a height beyond the common Rate even when my Necessities were not so terrifying; for I had now got into a little Vein of Work, and as I was not at a loss to handle my Needle, it was very probable I might have got my Bread honestly enough. first, when I began to feel the approach of my miserable Circumstances; I say, had such a prospect of getting Bread by working presented it self then, I had never fallen into this wicked Trade, or into such a wicked Gang as I was now embark'd with; but practise had hardened me, and I grew audacious to the last degree; and the more so, because I had carried it so long; and had never been taken; for in a word, my new Partner in Wickedness and I went on together so long, without being ever detected, that we not only grew Bold, but we grew Rich, and we had at one time One and Twenty Gold Watches in our Hands. finding I had so good a Stock before-hand, as I had, for I had near 200 l. in Money for my Share; it came strongly into my my Mind, no doubt from some kind Spirit, if such there be; that as at first Poverty excited me, and my Distresses drove me to these dreadful Shifts; so seeing those Distresses were now relieved, and I could also get something towards a Maintenance by working, and had so good a Bank to support me, why should I not now leave off, while I was well; that I could not expect to go always free; and if I was once surrpis'd, I was undone. blessed hint from whatsoever hand it came, I had still a cast for an easie Life; but my Fate was otherwise determin'd, the busie Devil that drew me in, had too fast hold of me to let me go back; but as Poverty brought me in, so Avarice kept me in, till there was no going back; as to the Arguments which my Reason dictated for perswading me to lay down, Avarice stept in and said, go on, you have had very good luck, go on, till you have gotten Four or Five Hundred Pound, and then you shall leave off, and then you may live easie without working at all. a Charm, and had no Power to go without the Circle, till I was ingulph'd in Labyrinths of Trouble too great to get out at all. some more caution than before, and more than my Directors us'd for themselves. My Comerade, as I call'd her, she should have been called my Teacher, with another of her Scholars, was the first in the Misfortune, for happening to be upon the hunt for Purchase, they made an attempt upon a Linnen-Draper in Cheapside, but were snap'd by a Hawks ey'd Journey-man, and seiz'd with two pieces of Cambrick, which were taken also upon them. Misfortune to have some of their former Sins brought to remembrance; two other Indictments being brought against them, and the Facts being prov'd upon them, they were both condemn'd to Die; they both pleaded their Bellies and were both voted Quick with Child; tho' my Tutress was no more with Child than I was. would be my turn next; but the place gave me so much Horror, reflecting that it was the place of my unhapy Birth, and of my Mother's Misfortunes, that I could not bear it, so I left off going to see them. still, for I was yet free, and had nothing brought against me; but it could not be, my Measure was not yet fill'd up. Offender was spar'd, having obtain'd a Reprieve; but lay starving a long while in Prison, till at last she got her Name into what they call a Circuit Pardon, and so came off. while I made no Excursions; but one Night, in the Neighbourhood of my Governesses House, they cry'd Fire; my Governess look'd out, for we were all up, and cry'd immediately that such a Gentlewoman's House was all of a light Fire a top, and so indeed it was: Here she gives me a jog, now, Child, says she, there is a rare opportunity, the Fire being so near that you may go to it before the Street is block'd up with the Crowd; she presently gave me my Cue, go, Child, says she, to the House, and run in and tell the Lady, or any Body you see, that you come to help them, and that you came from such a Gentlewoman (that is one of her Acquaintance farther up the Street). may be sure; I run in, and finding one of the Maids, alas! Sweetheart, said I, how came this dismal Accident? Where is your Mistress? Is she safe? And where are the Children?  I come from Madam --- to help you; away runs the Maid, Madam, Madam, says she, screaming as loud as she cou'd yell, here is a Gentlewoman come from Madam --- to help us: The poor Woman half out of her Wits, with a Bundle under her Arm, and two little Children, comes towards me, Madam, says I, let me carry the poor Children to Madam ---, she desires you to send them; she'll take care of the poor Lambs, and so I takes one of them out of her Hand, and she lifts the tother up into my Arms; ay, do, for God sake, says she, carry them; O thank her for her kindness: Have you any thing else to secure, Madam? says I, she will take care of it: O dear! says she, God bless her, take this bundle of Plate and carry it to her too; O she is a good Woman; O, we are utterly ruin'd, undone; and away she runs from me out of her Wits, and the Maids after her, and away comes I with the two Children and the Bundle. O! says she, Mistress, in a piteous Tone, you will let fall the Child; come, come, this is a sad time, let me help you, and immediately lays hold of my Bundle to carry it for me; no, says I, if you will help me, take the Child by the Hand, and lead it for me but to the upper end of the Street, I'll go with you and satisfie you for your pains. was one of the same Business with me, and wanted nothing but the Bundle; however, she went with me to the Door, for she cou'd not help it; when we were come there I whisper'd her, go Child, said I, I understand your Trade, you may meet with Purchase enough. Children, and as the People were rais'd before by the noise of the Fire, I was soon let in, and I said, is Madam awake, pray tell her Mrs. --- desires the favour of her to take the two Children in; poor Lady, she will be undone, their House is all of a Flame; they took the Children in very civily, pitied the Family in Distress, and away came I with my Bundle; one of the Maids ask'd me, if I was not to leave the Bundle too; I said no, Sweetheart, 'tis to go to another Place, it does not belong to them. Bundle of Plate, which was very considerable, strait home, to my old Governess; she told me she would not look into it, but bad me go again and look for more. which was on Fire, and I did my endeavour to go, but by this time the allarm of Fire was so great, and so may Engines playing and the Street so throng'd with People, that I cou'd not get near the House, whatever I cou'd do; so I came back again to my Governesses, and taking the Bundle up into my Chamber, I began to examine it: It is with Horror that I tell what a Treasure I found there; 'tis enough to say, that besides most of the Family Plate, which was considerable, I found a Gold Chain, an old fashion'd thing, the Locket of which was broken, so that I suppose it had not been us'd some Years, but the Gold was not the worse for that; also a little Box of burying Rings, the Lady's Wedding-Ring, and some broken bits of old Lockets of Gold, a Gold Watch, and a Purse with about 24 l. value in old Pieces of Gold Coin, and several other things of Value. for indeed, tho', as I have said above, I was harden'd now beyond the Power of all Reflection in other Cases, yet it really touch'd me to the very Soul, when I look'd into this Treasure; to think of the poor disconsolate Gentlewoman who had lost so much besides; and who would think to be sure that she had sav'd her Plate and best things; how she wou'd be surpriz'd when she should find that she had been deceiv'd, and that the Person that took her Children and her Goods, had come, as was pretended, from the Gentlewoman in next Street, but that the Children had been put upon her without her own knowledge. made me relent exceedingly, and Tears stood in my Eyes upon that Subject: But with all my Sense of its being cruel and Inhuman, I cou'd never find in my Heart to make any Restitution: The Reflection wore off, and I quickly forgot the Circumstances that attended it. than before, yet the Resolution I had formerly taken of leaving off this horrid Trade, when I had gotten a little more, did not return; but I must still get more; and the Avarice had such Success, that I had no more Thoughts of coming to a timely Alteration of Life; tho' without it I cou'd expect no Safety, no Tranquility in the Possession of what I had gain'd; a little more, and a little more, was the Case still. Remorse and all the Reflections on that Head, turn'd to no more than this, that I might perhaps come to have one Booty more that might compleat all; but tho' I certainly had that one Booty, yet every hit look'd towards another, and was so encouraging to me to go on with the Trade, that I had no Gust to the laying it down. into the Snare in which I was appointed to meet with my last Reward for this kind of Life: But even this was not yet, for I met with several succesful Adventures more in this way. Comerade that had been hang'd, for she knew enough of my Governess to have sent her the same way, and which made her very uneasy; indeed she was in a very great fright. Governess was easy as to that Point, and perhaps glad she was hang'd; for it was in her power to have obtain'd a Pardon at the Expence of her Friends; But, the loss of her, and the Sense of her Kindness in not making her Market of what she knew, mov'd my Governess to Mourn very sincerely for her: I comforted her as well as I cou'd, and she in return harden'd me to Merit more compleatly the same Fate. very shie of Shop-lifting, especially among the Mercers and Drapers who are a Set of Fellows, that have their Eyes very much about them: I made a Venture or two among the Lace Folks, and the Mileners, and particularly at one Shop, where two young Women were newly set up, and not been bred to Trade: There, I carried off a Peice of Bonelace, worth six or seven Pound, and a Paper of Thread; but this was but once, it was a Trick that would not serve again. especially, when the People were such as were not bred to Shops; such may depend upon it, that they will be visited once or twice at their beginning, and they must be very Sharp indeed if they can prevent it. Nothing considerable offering for a good while; I began to think that I must give over Trade in Earnest; but my Governess, who was not willing to lose me, and expected great Things of me, brought me one Day into Company with a young Woman and a Fellow that went for her Husband, tho' as it appear'd afterwards she was not his Wife, but they were Partners in the Trade they carried on; and in something else too. In short, they robb'd together, lay together, were taken together, and at last were hang'd together. and they carried me out into three or four Adventures, where I rather saw them commit some Course and unhandy Robberies, in which nothing but a great Stock of impudence on their Side, and gross Negligence on the Peoples Side who were robb'd, could have made them Successful; so I resolv'd from that time forward to be very Cautious how I Adventur'd with them; and indeed when two or three unlucky Projects were propos'd by them, I declin'd the offer, and perswaded them against it: One time they particularly propos'd Robbing a Watchmaker of 3 Gold Watches, which they had Ey'd in the Day time, and found the Place where he laid them; one of them had so many Keys of all kinds, that he made no Question to open the Place, where the Watchmaker had laid them; and so we made a kind of an Appointment; but when I came to look narrowly into the Thing, I found they propos'd breaking open the House, and this I would not Embark in, so they went without me: They did get into the House by main Force, and broke up the lock'd Place where the Watches were, but found but one of the Gold Watches, and a Silver one, which they took, and got out of the House again very clear; but the Family being alarm'd cried out Thieves, and the Man was pursued and taken, the young Woman had got off too, but unhappily was stop'd at a Distance, and the Watches found upon her; and thus I had a second Escape, for they were convicted, and both hang'd, being old Offenders, tho' but young People; and as I said before, that they robb'd together, so now they hang'd together, and there ended my new Partnership. having such an Example before me; but I had a new Tempter, who prompted me every day, I mean my Governess; and now a Prize presented, which as it came by her Management, so she expected a good Share of the Booty; there was a good Quantity of Flanders-Lace lodg'd in a private House, where she had heard of it; and Flanders Lace, being Prohibited, it was a good Booty to any Custom-House Officer that could come at it: I had a full Account from my Governess, as well of the Quantity as of the very Place where it was conceal'd, so I went to a Custom-House Officer, and told him, I had a Discovery to make to him, if he would assure me that I should have my due Share of the Reward: This was so just an offer, that nothing could be fairer; so he agreed, and taking a Constable, and me with him, we beset the House; as I told him, I could go directly to the Place, he left it to me, and the Hole being very dark, I squeez'd myself into it, with a Candle in my Hand, and so reach'd the Peices out to him, taking care as I gave him some, so to secure as much about myself as I could conveniently Dispose of: There was near 300 l. worth of Lace in the whole; and I secur'd about 50 l. worth of it myself. The People of the House were not owners of the Lace, but a Merchant who had entrusted them with it; so that they were not so surpriz'd as I thought they would be. he had got, and appointed to meet him at a House of his own directing, where I came after I had dispos'd of the Cargo I had about me, of which he had not the least Suspicion; when I came, he began to Capitulate, believing I did not understand the right I had in the Prize, and would fain have put me off with Twenty Pound, but I let him know that I was not so ignorant as he suppos'd I was; and yet I was glad too, that he offer'd to bring me to a certainty; I ask'd 100 l. and he rose up to 30 l. I fell to 80 l. and he rise again to 40 l. in a Word, he offer'd 50 l. and I consented, only demanding a Peice of Lace, which I thought came to about 8 or 9 Pound, as if it had been for my own Wear, and he agreed to it, so I got 50 l. in Money paid me that same Night, and made an End of the Bargain; nor did he ever know who I was, or where to enquire for me; so that if it had been discover'd, that part of the Goods were embezzel'd; he could have made no Challenge upon me for it. her from this time for a very dexterous Manager in the nicest Cases; I found that this last was the best, and easiest sort of Work that was in my way, and I made it my business to enquire out prohibited Goods; and after buying some usually betray'd them, but none of these Discoveries amounted to any thing considerable, not like that I related just now; but I was Cautious of running the great Risques which I found others did, and in which they Miscarried every Day. happen'd in a Crowd, at a Meeting-House, where I was in very great Danger of being taken; I had full hold of her Watch, but giving a great Jostle, as if some body had thrust me against her, and in the Juncture giving the Watch a fair pull, I found it would not come; so I let it go that Moment, and cried as if I had been kill'd, that some body had Trod upon my Foot, and that there was certainly Pick-pockets there; for some body or other had given a pull at my Watch, for you are to observe, that on these Adventures we always went very well Dress'd, and I had very good Cloths on, and a Gold Watch by my Side, as like a Lady as other Folks. pocket too, for some body, she said, had try'd to pull her Watch away. stop'd as it were short, and the Crowd bearing her forward a little, she made a Noise too, but it was at some Distance from me, so that she did not in the least suspect me, but when she cried out a Pick- Pocket, some body cried out Ay, and here has been another, this Gentlewoman has been attempted too. they cried out a Pick-pocket again, and really seiz'd a young Fellow in the very Fact. This, tho' unhappy for the Wretch was very opportunely for my Case, tho' I had carried it handsomely enough before, but now it was out of Doubt, and all the loose part of the Crowd run that way, and the poor Boy was deliver'd up to the Rage of the Street, which is a Cruelty I need not describe, and which however, they are always glad of, rather than be sent to Newgate, where they lie often a long time, and sometimes they are hang'd, and the best they can look for, if they are Convicted, is to be Transported. more at Gold Watches a great while; there was indeed many Circumstances in this Adventure, which assisted to my Escape; but the chief was, that the Woman whose Watch I had pull'd at was a Fool; that is to say, she was Ignorant of the nature of the Attempt, which one would have thought she should not have been, seeing she was wise enough to fasten her Watch, so that it could not be slipt up; but she was in such a Fright, that she had no Thought about her; for she, when she felt the pull scream'd out, and push'd herself forward, and put all the People about her into disorder, but said not a Word of her Watch, or of a Pick-pocket, for at least two Minutes; which was time enough for me, and to spare; for as I had cried out behind her, as I have said, and bore myself back in the Crowd as she bore forward; there were several People, at least seven or eight, the Throng being still moving on, that were got between me and her in that time, and then I crying out a Pick-pocket, rather sooner than she, she might as well be the Person suspected as I, and the People were confus'd in their Enquiry; whereas, had she with a Presence of Mind needful on such an Occasion, as soon as she felt the pull, not skream'd out as she did, but turn'd immediately round, and seiz'd the next Body that was behind her, she had infallibly taken me. certainly a Key to the Clue of a Pick-pockets Motions, and whoever can follow it, will as certainly catch the Thief as he will be sure to miss if he does not. may be an Instruction for Posterity in the Case of a Pick-pocket, my good old Governess to give a short touch at her History, tho' she had left off the Trade, was as I may say, born a Pick-pocket, and as I understood afterward, had run thro' all the several Degrees of that Art, and yet had been taken but once; when she was so grossly detected, that she was convicted and order'd to be Transported; but being a Woman of a rare Tongue, and withal having Money in her Pocket; she found Means, the Ship putting into Ireland for Provisions, to get on Shore there, where she practised her old Trade some Years; when falling into another sort of Company, she turn'd Midwife and Procuress, and play'd a hundred Pranks, which she gave me a little History of, in Confidence between us as we grew more intimate; and it was to this wicked Creature that I ow'd all the Dexterity I arriv'd to, in which there were few that ever went beyond me, or that practis'd so long without any Misfortune. known in that Country, that she left Dublin, and came over to England, where the time of her Transportation being not expir'd, she left her former Trade, for fear of falling into bad Hands again, for then she was sure to have gone to Wreck: Here she set up the same Trade she had followed in Ireland, in which she soon, by her admirable Management, and a good Tongue, arrived to the Height, which I have already describ'd, and indeed began to be Rich, tho' her Trade fell off again afterwards. account for the concern she had in the wicked Life I was now leading; into all the Particulars of which she lead me, as it were, by the Hand, and gave me such Directions, and I so well follow'd them, that I grew the greatest Artist of my time, and work'd myself out of every Danger with such Dexterity, that when several more of my Comrades run themselves into Newgate, by that time they had been half a Year at the Trade: I had now practis'd upwards of five Year, and the People at Newgate did not so much as know me; they had heard much of me indeed, and often expected me there; but I always got off, tho' many times in the extreamest Danger. among the Trade, and some of them whose hatred was owing rather to Envy, than any Injury I had done them began to be Angry, that I should always Escape when they were always catch'd and hurried to Newgate. These were they that gave me the Name of Moll Flanders: For it was no more of Affinity with my real Name, or with any of the Names I had ever gone by, than black is of Kin to white, except that once, as before I call'd my self Mrs. Flanders, when I sheltered my self in the Mint; but that these Rogues never knew, nor could I ever learn how they came to give me the Name, or what the Occasion of it was. Newgate, had vowed to Impeach me; and as I knew that two three of them were but too able to do it, I was under a great concern, and kept within Doors for a good while; but my Governess who was Partner in my Success, and who now plaid a sure Game, for she had a Share in the hazard, I say, my Governess was something impatient of my leading such a useless unprofitable Life, as she call'd it; and she laid a new Contrivance for my going Abroad, and this was to Dress me up in Men's Cloths, and so put me into a new kind of Practise. however, as I seldom went Abroad, but in the Night it did well enough; but it was long before I could behave in my new Cloaths; it was impossible to be so Nimble, so Ready, so Dexterous at these things, in a Dress contrary to Nature; and as I did every thing Clumsily, so I had neither the sucess, or easiness of Escape that I had before, and I resolv'd to leave it off; but that Resolution was confirm'd soon after by the following Accident. a young Fellow that was Nimble enough at his Business, and for about three Weeks we did very well together.  Our principal Trade was watching Shop- Keepers Compters, and Sliping off any kind of Goods we could see carelesly laid any where, and we made several good Bargains as we call'd them at this Work: And as we kept always together, so we grew very intimate, yet he never knew that I was not a Man; nay, tho' I several times went home with him to his Lodgings, according as our business directed, and four or five times lay with him all Night: But our Design lay another way, and it was absolutely necessary to me to conceal my Sex from him, as appear'd afterwards: The Circumstances of our Living, coming in late, and having such Business to do as requir'd that no Body should be trusted with coming into our Lodgings, were such as made it impossible to me to refuse lying with him, unless I would have own'd my Sex, and as it was I effectually conceal'd my self. must own I was sick of too: We had made several Prizes in this new way of Business, but the last would have been extraordinary; there was a Shop in a certain Street which had a Warehouse behind it that look'd into another Street, the House making the Corner. board which was just before it, five peices of Silks, besides other Stuffs; and tho' it was almost dark, yet the People being busie in the fore Shop had not had time to shut up those Windows, or else had forgot it. himself, it lay within his reach he said, and he swore violently to me that he would have it, if he broke down the House for it; I dissuaded him a little, but saw there was no Remedy, so he run rashly upon it, slipt out a Square out of the Sash Window dexterously enough, and got four Peices of the Silks, and came with them towards me, but was immediately persued with a terrible Clutter and Noise; we were standing together indeed, but I had not taken any of the Goods out of his Hand, when I said to him hastily, you are undone! he run like Lightning, and I too, but the pursuit was hotter after him, because he had the Goods; he dropt two of the Peices which stop'd them a little, but the Crowd encreas'd and pursued us both; they took him soon after with the other two Peices, and then the rest follow'd me; I run for it and got into my Governesses House, whether some quick-ey'd People follow'd me so warmly as to fix me there; they did not immediately knock at the Door, by which I got time to throw off my Disguise, and dress me in my own Cloaths; besides, when they came there, my Governess, who had her Tale ready, kept her Door shut, and call'd out to them and told them there was no Man came in there; the People affirm'd there did a Man come in there, and swore they would break open the Door. should very freely come and search her House, if they would bring a Constable, and let in none but such as the Constable would admit, for it was unreasonable to let in a whole Crowd; this they could not refuse, tho' they were a Crowd; so a Constable was fetch'd immediately, and she very freely open'd the Door, the Constable kept the Door, and the Men he appointed search'd the House, my Governess going with them from Room to Room; when she came to my Room she call'd to me, and said aloud; Cousin, pray open the Door, here's some Gentlemen that must come and look into your Room. call'd her; and I bad her open the Door, and there sat I at work with a great litter of things about me, as if I had been at Work all Day, being undress'd, with only Nightcloaths on my Head, and a loose Morning Gown about me: My Governess made a kind of excuse for their disturbing me, telling partly the occasion of it, and that she had no Remedy but to open the Doors to them, and let them satisfie themselves, for all she could say to them would not satifie them: I sat still, and bid them search if they pleas'd, for if there was any Body in the House, I was sure they was not in my Room; and for the rest of the House I had nothing to say to that, I did not understand what they look'd for. me civiller than I expected, but it was not till they had search'd the Room to a nicety, even under the Bed, and in the Bed, and every where else, where it was possible any thing cou'd be hid; when they had done and cou'd find nothing, they ask'd my Pardon, and went down. Top to Bottom, and cou'd find nothing, they appeas'd the Mob pretty well; but they carried my Governess before the Justice: Two Men swore that they see the Man, who they pursued, go into her House: My Governess rattled and made a great noise that her House should be insulted, and that she should be used thus for nothing; that if a Man did come in, he might go out again presently for ought she knew, for she was ready to make Oath that no Man had been within her Doors all that Day as she knew of; which was very true; that it might be, that as she was above Stairs, any Fellow in a Fright might find the Door open, and run in for shelter when he was pursued, but that she knew nothing of it; and if it had been so, he certainly went out again, perhaps at the other Door, for she had another Door into an Alley, and so had made his escape. giving her an Oath, that she had not receiv'd or admitted any Man into her House to conceal him, or protect or hide him from Justice: This Oath she might justly take, and did so, and so she was dismiss'd. impossible for my Governess ever to bring me to Dress in that Disguise again; for, as I told her, I should certainly betray myself. away before my Lord Mayor, and by his Worship committed to Newgate, and the People that took him were so willing, as well as able, to Prosecute him, that they offer'd themselves to enter into Recognisances to appear at the Sessions, and persue the Charge against him. Accomplices, and particularly, the Man that was concern'd with him in this Robbery, and he fail'd not to do his Endeavour, for he gave in my Name who he call'd Gabriel Spencer, which was the Name I went by to him, and here appear'd the Wisdom of my concealing my self from him, without which I had been undone. he discover'd the Place where he said I Lodg'd; and in a Word, all the Particulars that he could of my Dwelling; but having conceal'd the main Circumstances of my Sex from him; I had a vast Advantage, and he could never hear of me; he brought two or three Families into trouble, by his Endeavouring to find me out, but they knew nothing of me, any more than that he had a Fellow with him, that they had seen, but knew nothing of; and as to my Governess, tho' she was the Means of his coming to me, yet it was done at second Hand, and he knew nothing of her neither. being able to make it good, it was look'd upon as triffling, and he was the more fiercely persued by the Shopkeeper. out of the Way, I went away from my Governess for a while; but not knowing whither to wander, I took a Maid Servant with me, and took the Stage Coach to Dunstable to my old Landlord and Landlady, where I lived so handsomely with my Lancashire Husband: Here I told her a formal Story, that I expected my Husband every Day from Ireland, and that I had sent a Letter to him, that I would meet him at Dunstable at her House, and that he would certainly Land if the Wind was fair, in a few Days; so that I was come to spend a few Days with them till he could come, for he would either come Post, or in the West-Chester Coach, I knew not which, but which soever it was, he would be sure to come to that House to meet me. with me, that if I had been a Princess I could not have been better used, and here I might have been Welcome a Month or two if I had thought Fit. disguis'd that it was scarce possible to Detect me) least this Fellow should find me out; and tho' he could not charge me with the Robbery, having perswaded him not to venture, and having done nothing of it my self, yet he might have charg'd me with other Things, and have bought his own Life at the Expence of mine. no Confident but my old Governess, and I knew no Remedy but to put my Life into her Hands, and so I did, for I let her know where to send to me, and had several Letters from her while I stay'd here, some of them almost scar'd me out of my Wits; but at last she sent me the joyful News that he was Hang'd, which was the Best News to me that I had heard a great while. secret Anxiety of my Mind excepted) but when I receiv'd this Letter I look'd pleasantly again, and told my Landlady that I had receiv'd a Letter from my Spouse in Ireland, that I had the good News of his being very well, but had the bad News that his Business would not permit him to come away so soon as he expected, and so I was like to go back again without him. he was well, for I have observ'd Madam, says she, you han't been so pleasant as you us'd to be; you have been over Head and Ears in Care for him, I dare say, says the good Woman; 'tis easie to be seen there's an Alteration in you for the better, says she: Well, I am sorry the Esquire can't come yet, says my Landlord, I should have been heartily glad to have seen him, when you have certain News of his coming, you'll take a Step hither again, Madam, says he, you shall be very welcome whenever you please to come. London, and found my Governess as well pleas'd as I was; and now she told me she would never recommend any Partner to me again, for she always found, she said, that I had the best Luck when I ventur'd by my self; and so indeed I had, for I was seldom in any Danger when I was by my self, or if I was, I got out of it with more Dexterity than when I was entangled with the dull Measures of other People, who had perhaps less forecast, and were more impatient than I; for tho' I had as much Courage to Venture as any of them, yet I us'd more Caution before I undertook a Thing, and had more Presence of Mind to bring my self off. my Companions were surpriz'd, and fell so suddenly into the Hand of Justice, yet I could not all this while enter into one serious Resolution to leave off this Trade; and especially considering that I was now very far from being Poor, that the Temptation of Necessity, which is the general Introduction of all such Wickedness, was now remov'd; that I had near 500 l. by me in ready Money, on which I might have liv'd very well, if I had thought fit to have retir'd; but, I say, I had not so much as the least Inclination to leave off; no not so much as I had before, when I had but 200 l. before hand, and when I had no such frightful Examples before my Eyes as these were: From hence 'tis evident, that when once we are harden'd in Crime, no Fear can affect us, no Example give us any Warning. tho' I wore it off too in Time, that Case was indeed very unhappy; I had made a Prize of a Piece of very good Damask in a Mercer's Shop, and went clear off my self; but had convey'd the Piece to this Companion of mine, when we went out of the Shop; and she went one way, I went another: We had not been long out of the Shop, but the Mercer mist the Piece of Stuff, and sent his Messengers, one, one way, and one another, and they presently seiz'd her that had the Piece, with the Damask upon her; as for me, I had very luckily stept into a House where there was a Lace Chamber, up one Pair of Stairs, and had the Satisfaction, or the Terror indeed of looking out of the Window, and seeing the poor Creature drag'd away to the Justice, who immediately committed her to Newgate. Goods pretty much to spend Time; then bought a few Yards of Edging, and paid for it, and came away very sad Hearted indeed; for the poor Woman, who was in Tribulation, for what I only had stolen. these People, yet I never let them know who I was; nor could they ever find out my Lodging, tho' they often endeavour'd to watch me to it. They all knew me by the Name of Moll Flanders, tho' even some of them rather believ'd I was she, than knew me to be so; my Name was publick among them indeed; but how to find me out they knew not, nor so much as how to guess at my Quarters, whether they were at the East End of the Town, or the West; and this Wariness was my Safety upon all these Occasions. knew that if I should do any thing that should miscarry, and should be carry'd to Prison she would be there, and ready to witness against me, and perhaps save her Life at my Expence; I consider'd that I began to be very well known by Name at the Old Baily, tho' they did not know my Face; and that if I should fall into their Hands, I should be treated as an old Offender; and for this Reason, I was resolv'd to see what this poor Creatures Fate should be before I stirr'd, tho' several times in her Distress I convey'd Money to her for her Relief. but that one Mrs. Flanders as she heard her call'd, (for she did not know her) gave the Bundle to her after they came out of the Shop, and bad her carry it Home. They ask'd her where this Mrs. Flanders was?  But she could not produce her, neither could she give the least Account of me; and the Mercer's Men swearing positively that she was in the Shop when the Goods were stolen; that they immediately miss'd them, and pursu'd her, and found them upon her; thereupon the Jury brought her in Guilty, but the Court considering that she really was not the Person that Stole the Goods, and that it was very possible she could not find out this Mrs. Flanders, meaning me, tho' it would save her Life, which indeed was true; they allow'd her to be Transported, which was the utmost Favour she could obtain, only that the Court told her, if she could in the mean time produce the said Mrs. Flanders, they would intercede for her Pardon, that is to say, if she could find me out, and hang me, she should not be Transported: This I took care to make impossible to her, and so she was Shipp'd off in pursuance of her Sentence a little while after. exceedingly; and I began to be very pensive, knowing that I was really the Instrument of her disaster; but my own Life, which was so evidently in Danger, took off my tenderness; and seeing she was not put to Death, I was easie at her Transportation, because she was then out of the way of doing me any Mischief whatever should happen. Story, and was indeed partly the Occasion of my Governess proposing to Dress me up in Men's Cloths, that I might go about unobserv'd; but I was soon tir'd of that Disguise, as I have said, for it expos'd me to too many Difficulties. that had either been concern'd with me, or that knew me by the Name of Moll Flanders, were either hang'd or Transported; and if I should have had the Misfortune to be taken, I might call myself any thing else, as well as Moll Flanders, and no old Sins could be plac'd to my Account; so I began to run a Tick again, with the more fredom, and several successful Adventures I made, tho' not such as I had made before. Place where my Governess liv'd, and I made an attempt there as before, but as I was not soon enough before the Crowd of People came in, and could not get to the House I aim'd at; instead of a Prize, I got a mischief, which had almost put a Period to my Life, and all my wicked doings together; for the Fire being very furious, and the People in a great Fright in removing their Goods, and throwing them out of Window; a Wench from out of a Window threw a Featherbed just upon me; it is true, the Bed being soft it broke no Bones; but as the weight was great, and made greater by the Fall, it beat me down, and laid me dead for a while; nor did the People concern themselves much to deliver me from it, or to recover me at all; but I lay like one Dead and neglected a good while; till some body going to remove the Bed out of the way, helped me up; it was indeed a wonder the People in the House had not thrown other Goods out after it, and which might have fallen upon it, and then I had been evitably kill'd; but I was reserved for further Afflictions. my Governess very much hurt, and Frighted, and it was a good while before she could set me upon my Feet again. had never made any Walks that Way, nor was the Fair of much Advantage to me; but I took a turn this Year into the Cloisters, and there I fell into one of the Raffling Shops: It was a thing of no great Consequence to me, but there came a Gentleman extreamly well Dress'd, and very Rich, and as 'tis frequent to talk to every Body in those Shops he singl'd me out, and was very particular with me; first he told me he would put in for me to Raffle, and did so; and some small matter coming to his Lot, he presented it to me, I think it was a Feather Muff: Then he continu'd to keep talking to me with a more than common Appearance of Respect; but still very civil and much like a Gentleman. Place to the Shop-Door, and then to take a walk in the Cloister, still talking of a Thousand things Cursorily without any thing to the purpose; at last he told me that he was charm'd with my Company, and ask'd me if I durst trust myself in a Coach with him; he told me he was a Man of honour, and would not offer any thing to me unbecoming him: I seem'd to decline it a while, but suffer'd myself to be importun'd a little, and then yielded. design'd; but I found afterward he had had some drink in his Head; and that he was not very unwilling to have some more: He carried me to the Spring Garden, at Knight's-Bridge, where we walk'd in the Gardens, and he Treated me very handsomely; but I found he drank freely, he press'd me also to drink, but I declin'd it. away in the Coach again, and he brought me into the Streets and by this time it was near Ten a-Clock at Night, when he stop'd the Coach at a House, where it seems he was acquainted, and where they made no scruple to show us up Stairs into a Room with a Bed in it; at first I seem'd to be unwilling to go up, but after a few Words, I yielded to that too, being indeed willing to see the End of it, and in Hopes to make something of it at last; as for the Bed, & c. I was not much concern'd about that Part. little and little yielded to every thing, so that in a Word, he did what he pleas'd with me; I need say no more: All this while he drank freely too, and about One in the Morning we went into the Coach again: The Air, and the shaking of the Coach made the Drink get more up in his Head, and he grew uneasy, and was for acting over again, what he had been doing before; but as I thought my Game now secure, I resisted, and brought him to be a little still, which had not lasted five Minutes, but he fell fast asleep. with a silk Purse of Gold, his fine full bottom Perrewig, and silver fring'd Gloves, his Sword, and fine Snuff-box, and gently opening the Coach-door, stood ready to jump out while the Coach was going on; but the Coach stopping in the narrow Street beyond Temple-Bar to let another Coach pass, I got softly out, fasten'd the Door again, and gave my Gentleman and the Coach the slip together. tho' I was not so past the Merry part of Life, as to forget how to behave, when a Fop so blinded by his Appetite should not know an old Woman from a young: I did not indeed look so old as I was by ten or twelve Year; yet I was not a young Wench of Seventeen, and it was easie enough to be distinguish'd: There is nothing so absurd, so surfeiting, so ridiculous as a Man heated by Wine in his Head, and a wicked Gust in his Inclination together; he is in the possession of two Devils at once, and can no more govern himself by his Reason than a Mill can Grind without Water; Vice tramples upon all that was in him that had any good in it; nay, his very Sense is blinded by its own Rage, and he acts Absurdities even in his View; such is Drinking more, when he is Drunk already; picking up a common Woman, without any regard to what she is, or who she is; whether Sound or Rotten, Clean or Unclean; whether Ugly or Handsome, Old or Young, and so blinded, as not really to distinguish; such a Man is worse than Lunatick; prompted by his vicious Head he no more knows what he is doing, than this Wretch of mine knew when I pick'd his Pocket of his Watch and his Purse of Gold. slaughter, till a Dart strikes through their Liver; an admirable Description, by the way, of the foul Disease, which is a poisonous deadly Contagion mingling with the Blood, whose Center or Fountain is in the Liver; from whence, by the swift Circulation of the whole Mass, that dreadful nauceous Plague strikes immediately thro' his Liver, and his Spirits are infected, his Vitals stab'd thro' as with a Dart. greatly apprehensive at first, what Danger I might be in from him; but he was really to be pityed in one respect that he seem'd to be a good sort of a Man in himself; a Gentleman that had no harm in his Design; a Man of Sense, and of a fine Behaviour; a comely handsome Person, a sober and solid Countenance, a charming beautiful Face, and every thing that cou'd be agreeable; only had unhappily had some Drink the Night before; had not been in Bed, as he told me when we were together; was hot, and his Blood fir'd with Wine, and in that Condition his Reason as it were asleep, had given him up. after that if I could have found out any way to have done it, I would have sent him safe home to his House, and to his Family, for 'twas ten to one but he had an honest virtuous Wife, and innocent Children, that were anxious for his Safety, and would have been glad to have gotten him Home, and have taken care of him, till he was restor'd to himself; and then with what Shame and Regret would he look back upon himself? how would he reproach himself with associating himself with a Whore? pick'd up in the worst of all Holes, the Cloister, among the Dirt and Filth of the Town? how would he be trembling for fear he had got the Pox, for fear a Dart had struck through his Liver, aad hate himself every time he look'd back upon the Madness and Brutality of his Debauch? how would he, if he had any Principles of Honour, abhor the Thought of giving any ill Distemper, if he had it, as for ought he knew he might, to his Modest and Virtuous Wife, and thereby sowing the Contagion in the Life-blood of his Posterity? Women they are concern'd with, in such Cases as these, have of them, it wou'd be a surfeit to them: As I said above, they value not the Pleasure, they are rais'd by no Inclination to the Man, the passive Jade thinks of no Pleasure but the Money; and when he is as it were drunk in the Extasies of his wicked Pleasure, her Hands are in his Pockets for what she can find there; and of which he can no more be sensible in the Moment of his Folly, than he can fore- think of it when he goes about it. better usage, that while he was busie with her another way, convey'd his Purse with twenty Guineas in it out of his Fob Pocket, where he had put it for fear of her, and put another Purse with guilded Counters in it into the room of it: After he had done, he says to her, now han't you pick'd my Pocket? she jested with him, and told him she suppos'd he had not much to loose; he put his Hand to his Fob, and with his Fingers felt that his Purse was there, which fully satisfy'd him, and so she brought off his Money; and this was a Trade with her, she kept a sham Gold Watch, and a Purse of Counters in her Pocket to be ready on all such Occasions; and I doubt not practis'd it with Success. her the Story, it so affected her, that she was hardly able to forbear Tears, to think how such a Gentleman run a daily Risque of being undone, every Time a Glass of Wine got into his Head. it pleased her wonderfully; nay, Child, says she, the Usage may, for ought I know, do more to reform him, than all the Sermons that ever he will hear in his Life, and if the Remainder of the Story be true, so it did. the Description I gave her of him, his Dress, his Person, his Face, all concurr'd to make her think of a Gentleman whose Character she knew; she mus'd a while, and I going on in the Particulars, says she, I lay a Hundred Pound I know the Man. Account in the World; he as had Injury enough already, and I would not be instrumental to do him any more: No, no, says she, I will do him no Injury, but you may let me satisfy my Curiosity a little, for if it is he, I warant you I find it out: I was a little startled at that, and I told her with an apparent Concern in my Face, that by the same Rule he might find me out, and then I was undone: She return'd warmly, Why, do you think I will betray you, Child?  No, no, says she, not for all he is worth in the World; I have kept your Counsel in worse Things than these, sure you may trust me in this: So I said no more. she was resolv'd to find it out; so she goes to a certain Friend of hers who was acquainted in the Family that she guess'd at, and told her she had some extraordinary Business with such a Gentleman, (who by the way was no less than a Baronet, and of a very good Family) and that she knew not how to come at him without somebody to introduce her: Her Friend promis'd her readily to do it, and accordingly goes to the House to see if the Gentleman was in Town. Home, but that he had met with a Disaster and was very ill, and there was no speaking to him; what Disaster, says my Governess hastily, as if she was surpriz'd at it? Why, says her Friend, he had been at Hampstead to Visit a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, and as he came back again he was set upon and Robb'd! and having got a little Drink too, as they suppose, the Rogues abus'd him, and he is very ill: Robb'd! says my Governess, and what did they take from him; why, says her Friend, they took his Gold Watch, and his Gold Snuff-box, his fine Perriwig, and what Money he had in his Pocket, which was considerable to be sure, for Sir --- never goes without a Purse of Guineas about him. now and got a Whore, and she has pick'd his Pocket, and so he comes Home to his Wife and tells her he has been robb'd; that's an old Sham, a thousand such Tricks are put upon the poor Women every Day. a Gentleman, there is not a finer Man, nor a soberer, modester Person in the whole City; he abhors such things, there's no Body that knows him will think such a thing of him: Well, well, says my Governess, that's none of my Business, if it was, I warrant I should find there was something of that in it; your modest Men in common Opinion are sometimes no better than other People, only they keep a better Character, or if you please, are the better Hypocrites. really an honest sober Gentleman, and he has certainly been Robb'd: Nay, says my Governess, it may be he has, it is no Business of mine I tell you; I only want to speak with him, my Business is of another Nature; but, says her Friend, let your Business be of what nature it will, you cannot see him yet, for he is not fit to be seen, for he is very ill, and bruis'd very much: Ay, says my Governess, nay then he has fallen into bad Hands to be sure; and then she ask'd gravely, pray where is he bruised? Why in his Head, says her Friend, and one of his Hands, and his Face, for they us'd him barbarously. Poor Gentleman, says my Governess, I must wait then till he recovers, and adds, I hope it will not be long. Gentleman, and a fine Gentleman he was, says she, but, Mercy on him, he is in a sad pickle now, I wonder what the D---l you have done to him; why you have almost kill'd him: I look'd at her with disorder enough; I kill'd him! says I, you must mistake the Person, I am sure I did nothing to him, he was very well when I left him, said I, only drunk and fast asleep; I know nothing of that, says she, but he is in a sad pickle now, and so she told me all that her Friend had said: Well then, says I, he fell into bad Hands after I left him, for I left him safe enough. her to this Gentleman; she had enquir'd otherways in the mean time, and found that he was about again, so she got leave to speak with him. her; she told her Tale much better than I shall be able to tell it for her, for she was Mistress of her Tongue, as I said already: She told him that she came, tho' a Stranger, with a single design of doing him a Service, and he should find she had no other End it; that as she came purely on so Friendly an Account, she beg'd a promise from him, that if he did not accept what she should officiously propose, he would not take it ill, that she meddl'd with what was not her Business; she assur'd him that as what she had to say was a Secret that belong'd to him only, so whether he accepted her offer or not, it should remain a Secret to all the World, unless he expos'd it himself; nor should his refusing her Service in it, make her so little show her Respect, as to do him the least Injury, so that he should be entirely at liberty to act as he thought fit. that requir'd much secresie; that he had never done any Man any wrong, and car'd not what any Body might say of him; that it was no part of his Character to be unjust to any Body, nor could he imagine in what any Man cou'd render him any Service; but that if it was as she said, he could not take it ill from any one that they should endeavour to serve him; and so, as it were, left her at liberty either to tell him, or not to tell him, as she thought fit. enter into the point with him; but however, after some other Circumlocutions, she told him, that by a strange and unaccountable Accident she came to have a particular knowledge of the late unhappy Adventure he had fallen into; and that in such a manner, that there was no Body in the World but herself and him, that were acquainted with it, no not the very Person that was with him. said she, of your being Robb'd coming from Knigbtsbr---, Hampstead, Sir, I should say, says she; be not surpris'd, Sir, says she, that I am able to tell you every step you took that Day from the Cloyster in Smithfield, to the Spring-Garden at Knightsbridge, and thence to the --- in the Strand, and how you were left asleep in the Coach afterwards; I say let not this surprize you, for Sir I do not come to make a Booty of you, I ask nothing of you, and I assure you the Woman that was with you knows nothing who you are, and never shall; and yet perhaps I may serve you farther still, for I did not come barely to let you know, that I was inform'd of these things, as if I wanted a Bribe to conceal them; assure your self, Sir, said she, that whatever you think fit to do or say to me, it shall be all a secret as it is, as much as if I were in my Grave. are a Stranger to me, but it is very unfortunate, that you should be let into the Secret of the worst action of my Life, and a thing that I am justly asham'd of, in which the only satisfaction I had was, that I thought it was known only to God and my own Conscience: Pray, Sir, says she, do not reckon the Discovery of it to me, to be any part of your Misfortune; it was a thing, I believe, you were surprised into, and perhaps the Woman us'd some Art to prompt you to it; however, you will never find any just Cause, said she, to repent that I came to hear of it; nor can your Mouth be more silent in it than I have been, and ever shall be. is, I do assure you she prompted me to nothing, she rather declin'd me; it was my own Folly and Madness that brought me into it all, ay and brought her into it too; I must give her her due so far: As to what she took from me, I cou'd expect no less from her in the condition I was in, and to this Hour I know not whether she Robbed me or the Coachman; if she did it I forgive her, I think all Gentlemen that do so, should be us'd in the same manner; but I am more concern'd for some other things, than I am for all that she took from me. himself freely to her; first, she said to him, in answer to what he had said about me, I am glad Sir you are so just to the Person that you were with; I assure you she is a Gentlewoman, and no Woman of the Town; and however you prevail'd with her as you did, I am sure 'tis not her Practise; you run a great venture indeed, Sir, but if that be part of you Care, you may be perfectly easie, for I do assure you no Man has touch'd her, before you, since her Husband; and he has been dead now almost eight Year. fright about it; however, when my Governess said this to him, he appeared very well pleas'd; and said, well, Madam, to be plain with you, if I was satisfy'd of that, I should not so much value what I lost; for as to that, the Temptation was great, and perhaps she was poor and wanted it: If she had not been poor Sir says she, I assure you she would never have yielded to you; and as her Poverty first prevail'd with you to let you do as you did, so the same Poverty prevail'd with her to pay her self at last, when she saw you was in such a Condition, that if she had not done it, perhaps the next Coachman or Chair-man might have done it more to your Hurt. that do so, ought to be us'd in the same manner, and then they would be cautious of themselves; I have no more concern about it, but on the score which you hinted at before: Here he entred into some freedoms with her on the Subject of what pass'd between us, which are not so proper for a Woman to write, and the great Terror that was upon his Mind with relation to his Wife, for fear she should have receiv'd any Injury from me, and should communicate it farther; and ask'd her at last if she cou'd not procure him an opportunity to speak with me; my Governess gave him farther assurances of my being a Woman clear from any such thing, and that he was as entirely safe in that respect, as he was with his own Lady; but as for seeing me, she said it might be of dangerous Consequence; but however, that she would talk with me, and let him know; endeavouring at the same time to perswade him not to desire it, and that it cou'd be of no Service to him; seeing she hop'd he had no desire to renew the Correspondence, and that on my account it was a kind of putting my Life in his Hands. assurances that were in his Power, not to take any Advantages of me, and that in the first place he would give me a general release from all Demands of any kind; she insisted how it might tend to farther divulging the Secret, and might be injurious to him, entreating him not to press for it, so at length he desisted. seem'd to be very desirous of his Gold Watch, and told her if she cou'd procure that for him, he would willingly give as much for it, as it was worth; she told him she would endeavour to procure it for him and leave the valuing it to himself. for it, which was more than I should have been able to make of it, tho' it seems it cost much more; he spoke something of his Perriwig, which it seems cost him three-score Guineas, and his Snuff-box, and in a few Days more, she carried them too; which oblig'd him very much, and he gave her Thirty more, the next Day I sent him his fine Sword, and Cane Gratis, and demanded nothing of him, but had no mind to see him, unless he might be satisfy'd I knew who he was, which he was not willing to. know all this matter; she form'd a long Tale of that part; how she had it from one, that I had told the whole Story to, and that was to help me dispose of the Goods; and this Confident brought Things to her, she being by Profession a Pawn-Broker; and she hearing of his Worship's disaster, guess'd at the thing in general; that having gotten the Things into her Hands, she had resolv'd to come and try as she had done: She then gave him repeated Assurances that it should never go out of her Mouth, and tho' she knew the Woman very well, yet she had not let her know, meaning me, any thing of who the Person was, which by the way was false; but however it was not to his Damage, for I never open'd my Mouth of it to any Body. often sorry that I had refus'd it; I was perswaded that if I had seen him, and let him know that I knew him, I should have made some Advantage of him, and perhaps have had some Maintenance from him; and tho' it was a Life wicked enough, yet it was not so full of Danger as this I was ingag'd in: However those Thoughts wore off, and I declin'd seeing him again, for that Time; but my Governess saw him often, and he was very kind to her, giving her something almost every time he saw her; one time in particu- she found him very Merry, and as she thought he had some Wine in his Head then, and he press'd her again to let him see that Woman, that, as he said, had bewitch'd him so that Night; my Governess, who was from the Beginning for my seeing him, told him, he was so desirous of it, that she could almost yield to it, if she could prevail upon me; adding that if he would please to come to her House in the Evening, she would endeavour it, upon his repeated Assurances of forgetting what was past. soon byass'd me to consent, in a Case which I had some regret in my Mind for declining before; so I prepar'd to see him; I dress'd me to all the Advantage possible I assure you, and for the first time us'd a little Art, I say for the first Time, for I had never yielded to the baseness of Paint before, having always had Vanity enough to believe I had no need of it. still, that he had been drinking, tho' very far from what we call being in Drink: He appear'd exceeding pleass'd to see me, and enter'd into a long Discourse with me, upon the old Affair; I beg'd his Pardon very often, for my Share of it, protested I had not any such Design when first I met him, that I had not gone out with him, but that I took him for a very civil Gentleman, and that he made me so many Promises of offering no Uncivility to me. that if it had not been so, he should never have taken the freedom with me he had done: He protested to me that he never touch'd any Woman but me, since he was marry'd to his Wife, and it was a Surprize upon him; Complimented me upon being so particularly agreeable to him, and the like, and talk'd so much of that kind, 'till I found he had talk'd himself almost into a Temper to do the thing again: But I took him up short, I protested I had never suffer'd any Man to touch me since my Husband died, which was near eight Year; he said he believ'd it; and added, that Madam, had intimated as much to him, and that it was his Opinion of that part which made him desire to see me again; and since he had once broken in upon his Virtue with me, and found no ill Consequences, he could be safe in venturing again; and so in short he went on, to what I expected, and to what will not bear relating. into a Room which had not a Bed in it, and yet had a Chamber within it, which had a Bed, whether we withdrew for the rest of the Night, and in short, after some time being together; he went to Bed, and lay there all Night, I withdrew, but came again undress'd before it was Day, and lay with him the rest of the Time. committing of it again; all the Reflections wear off when the Temptation renews it self; had I not yielded to see him again, the corrupt Desire in him had worn off, and 'tis very probable he had never fallen into it, with any Body else, as I really believe he had not done before. robb'd again; he told me he was fully satisfy'd in that Point; and putting his Hand in his Pocket gave me five Guineas, which was the first Money I had gain'd that way for many Years. settled way of Maintenance, which was what I would have been best pleas'd with: Once, indeed, he ask'd me how I did to live, I answer'd him pretty quick, that I assur'd him I had never taken that Course that I took with him; but that indeed I work'd at my Needle, and could just Maintain my self, that sometimes it was as much as I was able to do, and I shifted hard enough. lead me into that, which he assur'd me he never intended to do himself; and it touch'd him a little, he said, that he should be the Cause of his own Sin, and mine too: He would often make just Reflections, also upon the Crime itself, and upon the particular Circumstances of it, with respect to himself; how Wine introduc'd the Inclinations, how the Devil led him to the Place, and found out an Object to tempt him, and he made the Moral always himself. again in a Months time or longer; but then as the serious Part wore off, the lewd Part would wear in, and then he came prepar'd for the wicked Part; thus we liv'd for some Time; tho' he did not Keep, as they call it, yet he never fail'd doing things that were handsome, and sufficient to maintain me without Working, and which was better, without following my old Trade. did not come so often as usual, and at last he left it off altogether without any Dislike, or bidding adieu; and so there was an End of that short Scene of Life, which added no great Store to me, only to make more Work for Repentance. being thus provided for, I made no Adventures, no not for a Quarter of a Year after; but then finding the Fund fail, and being loath to spend upon the main Stock, I began to think of my old Trade, and to look abroad into the Street; and my first Step was lucky enough. to appear in, I was now in an ordinary Stuff Gown, a blue Apron and a Straw Hat; and I plac'd myself at the Door of the three Cups Inn in St. John's-Street: There were several Carriers us'd the Inn, and the Stage Coaches for Barnet, for Toteridge, and other Towns that Way, stood always in the Street, in the Evening, when they prepar'd to set out; so that I was ready for any thing that offer'd: The Meaning was this, People come frequently with Bundles and small Parcels to those Inns, and call for such Carriers, or Coaches as they want; to carry them into the Country; and there generally attends Women, Porter's Wives, or Daughters, ready to take in such things for the People that employ them. that stood there before, and which was the Porter's Wife belonging to the Barnet Stage Coach, having observ'd me, ask'd if I waited for any of the Coaches; I told her yes, I waited for my Mistress, that was coming to go to Barnet; she ask'd me who was my Mistress, and I told her any Madam's Name that came next me; but it seem'd I happen'd upon a Name, a Family of which Name liv'd at Hadly near Barnet. calling her at a Door a little way off, she desir'd me that if any Body call'd for the Barnet Coach, I would step and call her at the House, which it seems was an Ale-house; I said yes, very readily, and away she went. sweating, and asks for the Barnet Coach, I answer'd presently, here. Do you belong to the Barnet Coach? says she. Yes, Sweetheart, said I, What do you want? I want Room for two Passengers, says she. Where are they Sweetheart? said I. Here's this Girl, pray let her go into the Coach, says she, and I'll go and fetch my Mistress; make haste then Sweet-heart, says I, for we may be full else. The Maid had a great Bundle under her Arm; so she put the Child into the Coach; and I said, you had best put your Bundle into the Coach too; No, said she, I am afraid some Body should slip it away from the Child; give it me then, said I; take it then, says she, and be sure you take Care of it; I'll answer for it, said I, if it were Twenty Pound vallue. There take it then, says she, and away she goes. towards the Ale-house, where the Porter's Wife was, so that if I had met her, I had then only been going to give her the Bundle and to call her to her Business, as if I was going away, and could stay no longer; but as I did not meet her I walk'd away, and turning into Charter-house-Lane; made off thro' Charter-house-Yard, into Long-Lane, then into Bartholomew-Close, so into Little Britain, and thro' the Blue-Coat-Hospital, to Newgate-Street. in it, which was made up in a Piece of painted Callico; I also wrapt up my Straw Hat in it, and so put the Bundle upon my Head; and it was very well, that I did thus, for coming thro' the Blue-Coat-Hospital, who should I meet but the Wench, that had given me the Bundle to hold; it seems she was going with her Mistress, who she had been to fetch to the Barnet Coaches. went, and I brought my Bundle safe to my Governess; there was no Money, Plate, or Jewels in it; but a very good Suit of Indian Damask, a Gown and Petticoat, a lac'd Head and Ruffles of very good Flanders Lace, and some other Things, such as I knew very well the Value of. practis'd it with Success, and my Governess lik'd it extreamly; and indeed, I try'd it again several times, tho' never twice near the same Place; for the next time I try'd in White Chappel, just by the Corner of Petti-Coat-Lane, where the Coaches stand that go out to Stratford and Bow, and that Side of the Country; and another time at the Flying-Horse without Bishopsgate, where the Cheston Coaches then lay, and I had always the good Luck to come of with some Booty. Coasting Vessels from the North come, such as New-Castle upon Tyne, Sunderland, and other Places; here the Warehouse, being shut, comes a young Fellow with a Letter; and he wanted a Box, and a Hamper that was come from New-Castle upon Tyne, I ask'd him if he had the Marks of it, so he shows me the Letter, by Vertue of which he was to ask for it, and which gave an Account of the Contents, the Box being full of Linnen, and the Hamper full of Glass-Ware; I read the Letter, and took Care to see the Name, and the Marks, the Name of the Person that sent the Goods, and the Name of the Person they were sent to; then I bad the Messenger come in the Morning, for that the Warehouse-Keeper, would not be there any more that Night. to his dear Cousin Jemy Cole, in London, with an Account that he had sent by such a Vessel, (for I remembered all the Particulars to a Tittle) so many Pieces of Huckaback Linnen, and so many Ells of Dutch Holland, and the Like, in a Box, and a Hamper of Flint-Glasses from Mr. Henzill's Glass house; and that the Box was mark'd I C. No I. and the Hamper was directed by a Label on the Cording. and had the Goods deliver'd me without any Scruple; the Value of the Linnen being about 22 Pound. which daily Invention directed to, and which I manag'd with the utmost Dexterity, and always with Success. the Well, I fell into some Broils, which tho' they could not affect me fatally, yet made me known, which was the worst thing next to being found Guilty, that could befal me. Design in View, but only waiting for any thing that might offer, as I often did: It happen'd that while I was going along a Street in Covent-Garden, there was a great Cry of stop Thief, stop Thief; some Artists had it seems put a Trick upon a Shop-keeper, and being pursued, some of them fled one way, and some another; and one of them was, they said, dress'd up in Widow's Weeds, upon which the Mob gather'd about me, and some said I was the Person, others said no, immediately came the Mercer's Journey-man, and he swore aloud I was the Person, and so seiz'd on me; however, when I was brought back by the Mob to the Mercer's Shop, the Master of the House said freely that I was not the Woman; and would have let me go immediately; but another fellow said gravely, pray stay till Mr. ---, meaning the Journeyman, comes back, for he knows her; so they kept me near half an Hour; they had call'd a Constable, and he stood in the Shop as my Jayler; in talking with the Constable I enquir'd were he liv'd, and what Trade he was; the Man not apprehending in the least what happen'd afterwards, readily told me his Name, and where he liv'd; and told me as a Jest, that I might be sure to hear of his Name when I came to the Old- Bayly. Hands off me, the Master indeed was civiler to me than they; but he would not let me go, tho' he own'd I was in his Shop before. take it ill, if I made my self amends upon him another time; and desir'd I might send for Friends to see me have right done: No, he said, he could give no such liberty, I might ask it when I came before the Justice of Peace, and seeing I threaten'd him, he would take care of me in the mean time, and would lodge me safe in Newgate: I told him it was his time now, but it would be mine by and by, and govern'd my Passion as well as I was able, however, I spoke to the Constable to call me a Porter, which he did, and then I call'd for Pen, Ink, and Paper, but they would let me have none; I ask'd the Porter his Name, and where liv'd, and the poor Man told it me very willingly; I bad him observe and remember how I was treated there; that he saw I was detain'd there by Force; I told him I should want him in another Place, and it should not be the worse for him to speak; the Porter said he would serve me with all his Heart; but, Madam, says he, let me hear them refuse to let you go, then I may be able to speak the plainer. know in your own Conscience that I am not the Person you look for, and that I was not in your Shop before, therefore I demand that you detain me here no longer, or tell me the reason of your stopping me; the Fellow grew surlier upon this than before, and said he would do neither till he thought fit; very well, said I to the Constable and to the Porter, you will be pleas'd to remember this, Gentlemen, another time; the Porter said, yes, Madam, and the Constable began not to like it, and would have perswaded the Mercer to dismiss him, and let me go, since, as he said, he own'd I was not the Person; Good Sir, says the Mercer to him Tauntingly, are you a Justice of Peace, or a Constable?  I charg'd you with her, pray do your Duty: The Constable told him a little mov'd; but very handsomely, I know my Duty, and what I am, Sir. I doubt you hardly know what you are doing; they had some other hard words, and in the mean time the Journey men, impudent and unmanly to the last degree, used me barbarously, and one of them, the same that first seiz'd upon me, pretended he would search me, and began to lay Hands on me: I spit in his Face, call'd out to the Constable, and bad him take notice of my usage; and pray, Mr. Constable, said I, ask that Villain's Name, pointing to the Man; the Constable reprov'd him decently, told him that he did not know what he did, for he knew that this Master acknowledg'd I was not the Person; and says the Constable, I am afraid your Master is bringing himself and me too into Trouble, if this Gentlewoman comes to prove who she is, and where she was, and it appears that she is not the Woman you pretend to; Dam her, says the Fellow again, with an impudent harden'd Face, she is the Lady you may depend upon it, I'll swear she is the same Body that was in the Shop, and that I gave the pieces of Satin that is lost into her own Hand, you shall hear more of it when Mr. William and Mr. Anthony, those were other Journeymen, come back, they will know her again as well as I. Mr. William and Mr. Anthony, as he call'd them, and a great Rabble with them, bringing along with them the true Widow that I was pretended to be; and they came sweating and blowing into the Shop, and with a great deal of Triumph dragging the poor Creature in a most butcherly manner up towards their Master, who was in the back Shop, and they cry'd out aloud, here's the Widow, Sir, we have catch her at last; what do ye mean by that, says the Master, why we have her already, there she sits, and Mr. --- says he can swear this is she: The other Man who they call'd Mr. Antbony reply'd, Mr. --- may say what he will, and swear what he will, but this is the Woman, and there's the Remnant of Sattin she stole, I took it out of her Cloaths with my own Hand. Master look'd Pale; the Constable turn'd about and look'd at me; let 'em alone Mr. Constable, said I, let 'em go on; the Case was plain and could not be denied, so the Constable was charg'd with the right Thief, and the Mercer told me very civily he was sorry for the Mistake, and hop'd I would not take it ill; that they had so many Things of this nature put upon them every Day, that they could not be blam'd for being very sharp in doing themselves Justice: Not take it ill, Sir; said I, how can I take it well? if you had dismiss'd me when your insolent Fellow seiz'd on me in the Street, and brought me to you; and when you your self acknowledg'd I was not the Person, I wou'd have put it by, and not have taken it ill, because of the many ill things I believe you have put upon you daily; but your Treatment of me since has been unsufferable, and especially that of your Servant, I must and will have Reparation for that. Satisfaction, and would fain have had me told him what it was I expected; I told him I should not be my own Judge, the Law should decide it for me, and as I was to be carried before a Magistrate, I should let him hear there what I had to say; he told me there was no occasion to go before the Justice now, I was at liberty to go where I pleased, and calling to the Constable told him, he might let me go, or I was discharg'd; the Constable said calmly to him, Sir, you ask'd me just now, if I knew, whether I was a Constable or a Justice, and bad me do my Duty, and charg'd me with this Gentlewoman as a Prisoner; now Sir, I find you do not understand what is my Duty, for you would make me a Justice indeed; but I must tell you it is not in my Power: I may keep a Prisoner when I am charg'd with him, but 'tis the Law and the Magistrate alone that can discharge that Prisoner; therefore 'tis a Mistake Sir, I must carry her before a Justice now, whether you think well of it or not: The Mercer was very high with the Constable at first; but the Constable happening to be not a hir'd Officer, but a good Substantial kind of Man, I think he was a Corn- chandler, and a Man of good Sense stood to his Business, would not discharge me without going to a Justice of the Peace, and I insisted upon it too: When the Mercer see that; well, says he to the Constable, you may carry her where you please, I have nothing to say to her; but Sir, says the Constable, you will go with us, I hope, for 'tis you that charg'd me with her; no not I, says the Mercer, I tell you, I have nothing to say to her: But pray Sir do, says the Constable, I desire it of you for your own sake, for the Justice can do nothing without you: Prithee Fellow, says the Mercer, go about your Business, I tell you I have nothing to say to the Gentlewoman, I charge you in the King's Name to dismiss her: Sir, says the Constable, I find you don't know what it is to be a Constable, I beg of you don't oblige me to be rude to you: I think I need not, you are rude enough already, says the Mercer: No, Sir, says the Constable, I am not rude, you have broken the Peace in bringing an honest Woman out of the Street, when she was about her lawful Occasions, confining her in your Shop, and ill using her here by your Servants; and now can you say I am rude to you?  I think I am civil to you in not commanding you in the King's Name to go with me, and charging every Man I see, that passes your Door, to aid and assist me in carrying you by Force; this you know I have power to do, and yet I forbear it, and once more entreat you to go with me: Well, he would not for all this, and gave the Constable ill Language: However, the Constable kept his Temper, and would not be provok'd; and then I put in and said, come, Mr. Constable let him alone, I shall find ways enough to fetch him before a Magistrate, I don't fear that; but there's that Fellow, says I, he was the Man that seized on me, as I was innocently going along the Street, and you are a Witness of his Violence with me since, give me leave to charge you with him, and carry him before a Justice; yes, Madam says the Constable; and turning to the Fellow, come young Gentleman, says he to the Journeyman, you must go along with us, I hope you are not above the Constables Power, tho' your Master is. his Master, as if he cou'd help him; and he, like a Fool, encourag'd the Fellow to be rude, and he truly resisted the Constable, and push'd him back with a good Force when he went to lay hold on him, at which the Constable knock'd him down, and call'd out for help, immediately the Shop was fill'd with People, and the Constable seiz'd the Master and Man, and all his Servants. the Thief, made off, and got clear away in the Crowd; and two others that they had stop'd also, whether they were really Guilty or not; that I can say nothing to. went, had endeavour'd to bring the Mercer to his Senses; and he began to be convinc'd that he was in the wrong; and so at length we went all very quietly before the Justice, with a Mob of about 500 People at our Heels; and all the way we went I could hear the People ask what was the matter? and others reply and say, a Mercer had stop'd a Gentlewoman instead of a Thief, and had afterwards taken the Thief, and now the Gentlewoman had taken the Mercer, and was carrying him before the Justice; this pleas'd the People strangely, and made the Crowd encrease, and then cry'd out as they went, which is the Rogue? which is the Mercer? and especially the Women, then when they saw him they cryed out, that's he, that's he; and every now and then came a good dab of Dirt at him; and thus we march'd a good while, till the Mercer thought fit to desire the Constable to call a Coach to protect himself from the Rabble; so we Rode the rest of the way, the Constable and I, and the Mercer and his Man. Bloomsbury, the Constable giving first a summary account of the Matter, the Justice bad me speak, and tell what I had to say; and first he asked my Name, which I was very loath to give, but there was no remedy, so I told him my Name was Mary Flanders, that I was a Widow, my Husband being a Sea Captain, dyed on a Voyage to Virginia; and some other Circumstances I told, which he cou'd never contradict, and that I lodg'd at present in Town, with such a Person, naming my Governess; but that I was preparing to go over to America, where my Husband's Effects lay, and that I was going that Day to buy some Cloaths to put my self into second Mourning, but had not yet been in any Shop, when that Fellow, pointing to the Mercer's Journeyman came rushing upon me with such fury, as very much frighted me, and carried me back to his Master's Shop; where tho' his Master acknowledg'd I was not the Person; yet he would not dismiss me, but charg'd a Constable with me. suffer me to send for any of my Friends; how afterwards they found the real Thief, and took the Goods they had Lost upon her, and all the particulars as before. Discharging me, and at last his Servants refusing to go with him, when I had Charg'd him with him, and his Master encouraging him to do so; and at last his striking the Constable, and the like, all as I have told it already. a long Harangue of the great loss they have daily by the Lifters and Thieves; that it was easy for them to Mistake, and that when he found it, he would have dismiss'd me, & c. as above, as to the Journeyman he had very little to say, but that he pretended other of the Servants told him, that I was really the Person. discharg'd; that he was very sorry that the Mercer's Man should in his eager pursuit have so little Discretion, as to take up an innocent Person for a guilty, that if he had not been so unjust as to detain me afterwards; he believ'd I would have forgiven the first Affront; that however it was not in his Power to award me any Reparation, other, than by openly proving them, which he should do; but he suppos'd I would apply to such Methods as the Law directed; in the mean time he would bind him over. he should give me some satisfaction for that, for he should commit him to Newgate for Assaulting the Constable, and for Assaulting of me also. Master gave Bail; and so we came away; but I had the satisfaction of seeing the Mob wait upon them both, as they came out, Holooing, and throwing Stones and Dirt at the Coaches they rod in, and so I came Home. falls a Laughing at me; Why are you so merry, says I? the Story has not so much Laughing room in it, as you imagine; I am sure I have had a great deal of Hurry and Fright too, with a Pack of ugly Rogues. Laugh, says my Governess, I laugh Child to see what a lucky Creature you are; why this Jobb will be the best Bargain to you, that ever you made in your Life, if you manage it well: I warrant you, you shall make the Mercer pay 500 l. for Damages, besides what you shall get of the Journeyman. had given in my Name to the Justice of Peace; and I knew that my Name was so well known among the People at Hicks's Hall, the Old Baily, and such Places, that if this Cause came to be try'd openly, and my Name came to be enquir'd into, no Court would give much Damages, for the Reputation of a Person of such a Character; however, I was oblig'd to begin a Prosecution in Form, and accordingly my Governess found me out a very creditable sort of a Man to manage it, being an Attorney of very good Business, and of good Reputation, and she was certainly in the right of this; for had she employ'd a petty Fogging hedge Solicitor, or a Man not known, I should have brought it to but little. are recited above; and he assur'd me, it was a Case, as he said, that he did not Question, but that a Jury would give very considerable Damages; so taking his full Instructions, he began the Prosecution, and the Mercer being Arrested, gave Bail; a few Days after his giving Bail, he comes with his Attorney to my Attorney, to let him know, that he desir'd to Accommodate the matter, that it was all carried on in the Heat of an unhappy Passion; that his Client, meaning me, had a sharp provoking Tongue, and that I us'd them ill, gibbing at them, and jeering them, even while they believed me to be the very Person, and that I had provok'd them, and the like. Fortune, that I was able to do myself Justice, and had great Friends to stand by me too, who had all made me promise to Sue to the utmost, if it cost me a Thousand Pound, for that the Affronts I had receiv'd were unsufferable. blow the Coals, that if I enclin'd to an Accommodation, he would not hinder me, and that he would rather perswade me to Peace than to War; for which they told him he should be no looser, all which he told me very honestly, and told me that if they offer'd him any Bribe, I should certainly know it; but upon the whole he told me very honestly that if I would take his Opinion, he would Advise me to make it up, with them; for that as they were in a great Fright, and were desirous above all things to make it up, and knew that let it be what it would, they must bear all the Costs; he believed they would give me freely more than any Jury would give upon a Trial: I ask'd him what he thought they would be brought to; he told me he could not tell, as to that; but he would tell me more when I saw him again. told them he had, that he found me not so Averse to an Accommodation as some of my Friends were, who resented the Disgrace offer'd me, and set me on; that they blow'd the Coals in secret, prompting me to Revenge, or to do my self Justice, as they call'd it; so that he could not tell what to say to it; he told them he would do his endeavour to persuade me, but he ought to be able to tell me what Proposal they made: They pretended they could not make any Proposal, because it might be made use of against them; and he told them, that by the same Rule he could not make any offers, for that might be pleaded in Abatement of what Damages a Jury might be inclin'd to give: However, after some Discourse and mutal Promises that no Advantage should be taken on either Side, by what was transacted then, or at any other of those Meetings, they came to a kind of a Treaty; but so remote, and so wide from one another, that nothing could be expected from it; for my Attorney demanded 500 l. and Charges, and they offer'd 50 l. without Charges; so they broke off, and the Mercer propos'd to have a Meeting with me myself; and my Attorney agreed to that very readily. with some State, that the Mercer might see I was something more than I seem'd to be that time they had me: Accordingly I came in a new Suit of second Mourning, according to what I had said at the Justices; I set myself out too, as well as a Widows dress would admit; my Governess, also furnish'd me with a good Pearl Necklace, that shut in behind with a Locket of Diamonds, which she had in Pawn; and I had a very good Gold Watch by my Side; so that I made a very good Figure, and as I stay'd till I was sure they were come; I came in a Coach to the Door, with my Maid with me. made his Bow, which I took a little Notice of, and but a little, and went and sat down, where my own Attorney had appointed me to sit, for it was his House; after a while, the Mercer said, he did not know me again, and began to make some Compliments; I told him, I believ'd he did not know me at first, and that if he had, he would not have treated me as he did. testify the Willingness he had to make all possible Reparation, that he had appointed this Meeting; that he hop'd I would not carry things to Extremity, which might be not only too great a Loss to him, but might be the Ruin of his Business and Shop, in which Case I might have the Satisfaction of repaying an Injury with an Injury ten times greater; but that I would then get nothing, whereas he was willing to do me any Justice that was in his Power, without putting himself, or me to the Trouble or Charge of a Suit of Law. than he did before; that it was true, Acknowledgment in most Cases of Affronts was counted Reparation sufficient; but this had gone too far to be made up so; that I was not revengeful, nor did I seek his Ruin, or any Man's else, but that all my Friends were unanimous not to let me so far neglect my Character, as to adjust a thing of this kind without Reparation: That to be taken up for a Thief, was such an Indignity as could not be put up, that my character was above being treated so by any that knew me; but because in my Condition of a Widow, I had been careless of my self, I might be taken for such a Creature, but that for the particular Usage I had from him afterward, and then I repeated all as before, it was so provoking I had scarce Patience to repeat it. Hundred Pounds, and to pay all the Law Charges, and added, that he would make me a Present of a very good Suit of Cloaths; I came down to three Hundred Pounds, and demanded that I should publish an Advertisement of the Particulars in the common New's-Papers. by good Management of my Attorney to 150 l. and a Suit of black Silk Cloaths, and there, as it were at my Attorney's Request, I comply'd; he paying my Attorney's Bill and Charges, and gave us a good Supper into the Bargain. like an old Dutchess, and a Gentleman very well dress'd, who we pretended Courted me, but I call'd him Cousin, and the Lawyer was only to hint privately to them, that this Gentleman Courted the Widow. that it cost him 200 l. in all, or rather more: At our last Meeting, when all was agreed, the Case of the Journeyman came up, and the Mercer beg'd very hard for him, told me he was a Man that had kept a Shop of his own, and been in good Business, had a Wife and several Children, and was very poor, that he had nothing to make Satisfaction with, but should beg my Pardon on his Knees: I had no Spleen at the saucy Rogue, nor were his Submissions any thing to me, since there was nothing to be got by him; so I thought it was as good to throw that in generously as not, so I told him I did not desire the Ruin of any Man, and therefore at his Request I would forgive the Wretch, it was below me to seek any Revenge. Acknowledgement, which he would have done with as much mean Humility, as his Offence was with insulting Pride, in which he was an Instance of a compleat Baseness of Spirit, imperious, cruel, and relentless when Uppermost; abject and low Spirited when down: However, I abated his Cringes, told him, I forgave him, and desir'd he might withdraw, as if I did not care for the Sight of him, tho' I had forgiven him. leaving off, and my Governess often said I was the richest of the Trade in England, and so I believe I was; for I had 700 l. by me in Money, besides Cloaths, Rings, some Plate, and two Gold Watches, and all of them stol'n, for I had innumerable Jobbs, besides these I have mention'd; O! Had I even now had the Grace of Repentance, I had still Leisure to have look'd back upon my Follies, and have made some Reparation; but the Satisfaction I was to make for the Publick Mischiefs I had done, was yet left behind; and I could not forbear going abroad again, as I call'd it now, any more than I could when my Extremity really drove me out for Bread. went out in an Equipage quite different from any I had ever appear'd in before; I dress'd myself like a Begger Woman, in the coursest and most despicable Rags I could get, and I walk'd about Peering, and Peeping into every Door and Window I came near; and indeed I was in such a Plight now, that I knew as ill how to behave in, as ever I did in any; I naturally abhor'd Dirt and Rags; I had been bred up Tite and Cleanly, and could be no other, what-ever Condition I was in; so that this was the most uneasy Disguise to me that even I put on: I said presently to my self, that this would not do, for this was a Dress that every Body was shy, and afraid of; and I thought every Body look'd at me as if they were afraid I should come near them, least I should take something from them, or afraid to come near me, least they should get something from me: I wandred about all the Evening the first Time I went out, and made nothing of it, and came Home again wet, dragl'd, and tired: However I went out again the next Night, and then I met with a little Adventure, which had like to have cost me dear; as I was standing near a Tavern Door, there comes a Gentleman on Horseback, and lights at the Door, and wanting to go into the Tavern, he calls one of the Drawers to hold his Horse, he stay'd pretty long in the Tavern, and the Drawer heard his Master call, and thought he would he angry with him; seeing me stand by him, he call'd to me, here Woman, says he, hold this Horse a while, 'till I go in, if the Gentleman comes, he'll give you something; yes says I, and takes the Horse, and walks off with him very soberly, and carry'd him to my Governess. Thief more at a Loss to know what to do with any Thing that was stolen; for when I came Home, my Governess was quite confounded, and what to do with the Creature, we neither of us knew; to send him to a Stable was doing nothing, for it was certain that Notice would be given in the Gazzette, and the Horse describ'd, so that we durst not go to fetch it again. Horse at an Inn, and send a Note by a Porter to the Tavern, that the Gentleman's Horse that was lost at such a Time, was left at such an Inn, and that he might be had there; that the poor Woman that held him, having led him about the Street, not being able to lead him back again, had left him there; we might have waited till the owner had publish'd, and offer'd a Reward, but we did not care to venture the receiving the Reward. nothing was got by it, and I was quite Sick of going out in a Beggar's Dress; it did not answer at all, and besides I thought it Ominous and Threatning. Kind than any I ever sorted with, and I saw a little into their Ways too, these were Coiners of Money, and they made some very good Offers to me, as to Profit; but the Part they would have had me embark'd in, was the most dangerous; I mean that of the very working of the Dye, as they call it, which had I been taken, had been certain Death, and that at a Stake, I say, to be burnt to Death at a Stake; so that tho' I was to Appearance, but a Beggar; and they promis'd Mountains of Gold and Silver to me, to engage; yet it would not do; 'tis true, if I had been realy a Beggar, or had been desperate as when I began, I might perhaps have closed with it, for what care they to Dye, that cannot tell how to Live? But at present this was not my Condition, at least I was for no such terrible Risques as those; besides the very Thoughts of being burnt at a Stake, struck Terror to my very Soul, chill'd my Blood, and gave me the Vapours to such a Degree, as I could not think of it without trembling. yet I did not tell them so; but seem'd to relish it, and promis'd to meet again; but I durst see them no more; for if I had seen them, and not comply'd; tho' I had declin'd it with the greatest Assurances of Secresy in the World, they would have gone near to have murder'd me, to make sure Work, and make themselves easy, as they call it; what kind of Easiness that is, they may best judge that understand how easy Men are, that can murder People to prevent Danger. easily resolve I would have no more to say to them; my Business seem'd to lye another Way, and tho' it had hazard enough in it too, yet it was more suitable to me, and what had more of Art in it, and more Chances for a coming off, if a Surprize should happen. Gang of House Breakers; but that was a thing I had no mind to venture at neither, any more than I had at the Coining Trade; I offer'd to go along with two Men, and a Woman, that made it their Business to get into Houses by Stratagem, I was willing enough to venture; but there was three of them already, and they did not care to part, nor I to have too many in a Gang, so I did not close with them, and they paid dear for their next Attempt. she had made, and with Success at the Water-side, and I clos'd with her, and we drove on our Business pretty well: One Day we came among some Dutch People at St. Catherines, where we went on pretence to buy Goods that were privately got on Shore: I was two or three times in a House, where we saw a good Quantity of prohibited Goods, and my Companion once brought away three Peices of Dutch black Silk that turn'd to good Account, and I had my Share of it; but in all the Journeys I made by myself, I could not get an Opportunity to do any thing, so I laid it aside; for I had been there so often, that they began to suspect something. for I was not us'd to come back so often without Purchase; so the next Day I dress'd myself up fine, and took a Walk to the other End of the Town, I pass'd thro' the Exchange in the Strand, but had no Notion of finding any thing to do there, when on a sudden I saw a great Clutter in the Place, and all the People, Shopkeepers as well as others, standing up, and staring, and what should it be? but some great Dutchess come into the Exchange; and they said the Queen was coming; I set myself close up to a Shop side with my back to the Compter, as if to let the Crowd pass by, when keeping my Eye upon a parcel of Lace, which the Shop keeper was showing to some Ladies that stood by me; the Shop-keeper and her Maid were so taken up with looking to see who was a coming, and what Shop they would go to, that I found means to slip a Paper of Lace into my Pocket, and come clear off with it, so the Lady Millener paid dear enough for her gaping after the Queen. myself with the Crowd, went out at the other Door of the Exchange, and so got away before they miss'd their Lace; and because I would not be follow'd, I call'd a Coach and shut myself up in it; I had scarse shut the Coach Doors, but I saw the Milleners Maid, and five or six more come running out into the Street, and crying out as if they were frighted; they did not cry stop Thief, because no body ran away, but I cou'd hear the Word robb'd, and Lace, two or three times, and saw the Wench wringing her Hands, and run staring too, and again, like one scar'd; the Coachman that had taken me up, was getting up into the Box, but was not quite up, and the Horses had not begun to move, so that I was terrible uneasy; and I took the Packet of Lace and laid it ready to have dropt it out at the Flap of the Coach, which opens before, just behind the Coachman; but to my great satisfaction in less than a Minute, the Coach began to move, that is to say, as soon as the Coachman had got up, and spoken to his Horses; so he drove away, and I brought off my Purchase, which was worth near twenty Pound. walk'd the same way again, but nothing offer'd till I came into St. James's Park: I saw abundance of fine Ladies in the Park, walking in the Mall, and among the rest, there was a little Miss, a young Lady of about 12 or 13 Years old, and she had a Sister, as I suppos'd, with her, that might be about Nine: I observ'd the biggest had a fine gold Watch on, and a good Necklace of Pearl, and they had a Footman in Livery with them; but as it is not ususal for the Footmen to go behind the Ladies in the Mall; so I observ'd the Footman stop'd at their going into the Mall, and the biggest of the Sisters spoke to him, to bid him be just there when they came back. what little Lady that was? and held a little Chat with him, about what a prety Child it was with her, and how Genteel, and well Carriag'd, the eldest would be; how womanish, and how Grave; and the Fool of a Fellow told me presently who she was, that she was Sir Thomas \---'s eldest Daughter of Essex, and that she was a great Fortune, that her Mother was not come to Town yet; but she was with Sir William \---'s Lady at her Lodgings in Suffolk Street, and a great deal more; that they had a Maid and a Woman to wait on them, besides, Sir Thomas's Coach, the Coachman and himself, and that young Lady was Governess to the whole Family, as well here, as at Home; and, told me abundance of things enough for my business. Footman, and I puts myself in a Rank with this Lady, having stay'd till she had taken one Turn in the Mall, and was going forward again; by and by, I saluted her by her Name, with the Title of Lady Betty: I ask'd her when she heard from her Father? when my Lady her Mother would be in Town and how she did? suspect, but that I knew them all intimately: I as'd her why she would come Abroad without Mrs. Chime with her (that was the Name of her Woman) to take care of Mrs. Judith that was her Sister. Then I enter'd into a long Chat with her about her Sister, what a fine little Lady she was, and ask'd her if she had learn'd French, and a Thousand such little Things when on a sudden the Guards came, and the Crowd run to see the King go by to the Parliament- House. stand upon the edge of the Boards on the side of the Mall, that she might be high enough to see; and took the little one and lifted her quite up; during which, I took care to convey the gold Watch so clean away from the Lady Betty, that she never miss'd it, till the Crowd was gone, and she was gotten in to the middle of the Mall. Betty take care of your little Sister, and so the Crowd did as it were, Thrust me away, and that I was unwilling to take my leave. as the King is gone by; but as there is always a great running and clutter just as the King passes; so having drop'd the two little Ladies, and done my Business with them, without any Miscarriage, I kept hurrying on among the Crowd, as if I run to see the King, and so I kept before the Crowd, 'till I came to the End of the Mall; when the King going on toward the Horse-Guards; I went forward to the Passage, which went then thro' against the End of the Hay Market, and there I bestow'd a Coach upon my self, and made off; and I confess I have not yet been so good as my Word (viz.) to go and visit my Lady Betty. mist the Watch, and so have made a great Out-cry about it with her, and have got her into her Coach, and put my self in the Coach with her, and have gone Home with her, for she appear'd so fond of me, and so perfectly deceiv'd by my so readily talking to her of all her Relations and Family, that I thought it was very easy to push the thing farther, and to have got at least the Neck- Lace of Pearl; but when I consider'd that tho' the Child would not perhaps have suspected me, other People might, and that if I was search'd I should be discover'd; I thought it was best to go off with what I had got. her Watch, she made a great Out-cry in the Park, and sent her Footman up and down, to see if he could find me, she having describ'd me so perfectly, that he knew it was the same Person that had stood and talked so long with him, and ask'd him so many Questions about them; but I was gone far enough out of their reach, before she could come at her Footman to tell him the Story. been concern'd in yet, and this was at a Gaming House near Covent Garden. while with another Woman with me, and seeing a Gentleman go up that seem'd to be of more than ordinary Fashion, I said to him, Sir, pray don't they give Women Leave to go up? Yes Madam, says he, and to play too if they please; I mean so Sir, said I; and with that, he said he would introduce me if I had a Mind; so I follow'd him to the Door, and he looking in, there, Madam, says he, are the Gamesters, if you have mind to venture; I look'd in, and said to my Comerade, aloud, here's nothing but Men, I wont venture; at which one of the Gentlemen cry'd out, you need not be afraid Madam, here's none but fair Gamesters, you are very welcome to come and set what you please; so I went a little nearer and look'd on, and some of them brought me a Chair, and I sat down and see the Box and Dice go round a Pace; then I said to my Comrade, the Gentlemen play too high for us, come let us go. come Madam, if you please to venture, if you dare trust me I'll answer for it; you shall have nothing put upon you here; no Sir, said I, smiling, I hope the Gentlemen would not Cheat a Woman; but still I declin'd venturing, tho' I pull'd out a Purse with Money in it, that they might see I did not want Money. see you are afraid to venture for your self; I always had good Luck with the Ladies, you shall Set for me, if you won't Set for yourself; I told him, Sir I should be very loth to loose your Money, tho' I added, I am pretty lucky too; but the Gentlemen play so high, that I dare not venture my own. took the Money and set, himself looking on; I run out of the Guineas by One and Two at a Time, and then the Box coming to the next Man to me, my Gentleman gave me ten Guineas more, and made me Set Five of them at once, and the Gentleman who had the Box threw out, so there was five Guineas of his Money again; he was encourag'd at this, and made me take the Box, which was a bold Venture: However, I held the Box so long that I gain'd him his whole Money, and had a Handful of Guineas in my Lap, and which was the better Luck, when I threw out, I threw but at One or Two of those that had Set me, and so went off easie. was his own; and so would have had him play for himself, pretending that I did not understand the Game well enough: He laugh'd and said if I had but good Luck, it was no matter whether I understood the Game or no; but I should not leave off: However he took out the 15 Guineas that he had put in first, and bad me play with the Rest: I would have him to have seen how much I had got, but he said no, no, don't tell them, I believe you are very honest, and 'tis bad Luck to tell them, so I play'd on. cautiously, which was to keep a good Stock in my Lap, out of which I every now and then convey'd some into my Pocket; but in such a manner, as I was sure he could not see it. I held the Box, they Set me high, and I threw boldly at all; and held the Box 'till I had gain'd near fourscore Guineas, but lost above half of it back at the last throw; so I got up, for I was afraid I should lose it all back again, and said to him, pray come Sir now and take it and play for your self, I think I have done pretty well for you; he would have had me play'd on, but it grew late, and I desir'd to be excus'd.  When I gave it up to him, I told him I hop'd he would give me Leave to tell it how, that I might see what he had gain'd, and now Lucky I had been for him; when I told them there was threescore and three Guineas. Ay, says I, if it had not been for that unlucky Throw I had got you a hundred Guineas; so I gave him all the Money, but he would not take it 'till I had put my Hand into it, and taken some for my self, and bid me please my self; I refus'd it, and was positive I would not take it my self, if he had a Mind to do any Thing of that Kind it should be all his own doings. absolutely refus'd that; then one of them said, D---n ye Jack, half it with her, don't you know you should be always upon even Terms with the Ladies; so in short, he divided it with me, and I brought away 30 Guineas, besides about 43, which I had stole privately, which I was sorry for, because he was so generous. Luck I had at Play: However it was her Advice that I should not venture again, and I took her Council, for I never went there any more; for I knew as well as she, if the Itch of Play came in, I might soon lose that, and all the rest of what I had got. my Governess too, for she always had a Share with me, that really the old Gentlewoman began to talk of leaving off while we were well, and being satisfy'd with what we had got; but, I know not what Fate guided me, I was as backward to it now, as she was when I propos'd it to her before, and so in an ill Hour we gave over the Thoughts of it for the present, and in a Word I grew more hardn'd and audacious than ever, and the Success I had, made my Name as famous as any Thief of my sort ever had been. is not according to Practice, which however succeeded not amiss; but generally I took up new Figures, and contriv'd to appear in new Shapes every time I went abroad. them gone out of Town, Tunbridge, and Epsom, and such Places were full of People, but the City was thin, and I thought our Trade felt it a little, as well as others; so that at the latter End of the Year I joyn'd my self with a Gang, who usually go every Year to Sturbridge Fair, and from thence to Bury Fair, in Suffolk: We promised ourselves great Things here, but when I came to see how Things were, I was weary of it presently; for except meer picking of Pockets, there was little worth meddling with; neither if a Booty had been made, was it so easy carrying it off, nor was there such a Variety of Occasion for Business in our Way, as in London; all that I made of the whole Journey, was a Gold Watch at Bury Fair, and a small Parcel of Linnen at Cambridge, which gave me Occasion to take Leave of the Place: It was an old Bite, and I thought might do with a Country Shop-Keeper, tho' in London it would not. Cambridge, as much fine Holland, and other Things as came to about seven Pound; when I had done, I bad them be sent to such an Inn, where I had taken up my Being the same Morning, as if I was to Lodge there that Night. Inn where I lay, and I would pay him his Money; at the Time appointed the Draper sends the Goods, and I plac'd one of our Gang at the Chamber Door, and when the Inn-Keeper's Maid brought the Messenger to the Door, who was a young Fellow, an Apprentice, almost a Man; she tells him her Mistress was a sleep, but if he would leave the Things, and call in about an Hour, I should be awake, and he might have the Money; he left the Parcel very readily, and goes his way, and in about half an Hour my Maid and I walk'd off, and that very Evening I hired a Horse, and a Man to ride before me, and went to New- Market, and from thence got my Passage in a Coach that was not quite full to St. Edmund's Bury; where as I told you I could make but little of my Trade, only at a little Country Opera House, I got a Gold Watch from a Ladies Side, who was not only intollerably Merry, but a little Fuddled, which made my Work much easier. Harwich; where I went into an Inn, as if I had newly arriv'd from Holland, not doubting but I should make some Purchase among the Foreigners that came on Shore there; but I found them generally empty of Things of Value, except what was in their Portmantuas, and Dutch Hampers, which were always guarded by Footmen; however, I fairly got one of their Portmantuas one Evening out of the Chamber where the Gentleman lay, the Footman being fast a sleep on the Bed, and I suppose very Drunk. dragg'd the heavy thing with much a-do out of the Chamber into mine; I went out into the Street, to see if I could find any possibility of carrying it off; I walk'd about a great while but could see no probability, either of getting out the Thing, or of conveying away the Goods that was in it, the Town being so small, and I a perfect Stranger in it; so I was returning with a Resolution to carry it back again, and leave it where I found it; just in that very Moment I heard a Man make a Noise to some People to make haste, for the Boat was going to put off, and the Tyde would be spent; I call'd to the Fellow, What Boat is it Friend, said I, that you belong to?  The Ipswich Wherry, Madam, says he. When do you go off? says I. This Moment, Madam, Says he, Do you want to go thither? Yes, said I, if you can stay till I fetch my Things. Where are your Things Madam? says he. At such an Inn, said I, Well, I'll go with you Madam, says he, very civilly, and bring them for you; come away then, says I, and takes him with me. Holland, being just come in, and two Coaches just come also with Passengers from London, for another Packet Boat that was going off for Holland, which Coaches were to go back next Day with the Passengers that were just Landed: In this Hurry it was, that I came to the Barr, and paid my Reckoning, telling my Landlady I had gotten my Passage by Sea in a Wherry. Passengers from Harwich to London; and tho' they are call'd Wherries, which is a Word us'd in the Thames for a small Boat, row'd with one or two Men; yet these are Vessels able to carry twenty Passengers, and ten or fiveteen Ton of Goods, and fitted to bear the Sea; all this I had found out by enquiring the Night before into the several Ways of going to London. call'd away, all the House being in a Hurry; so I left her, took the Fellow up into my Chamber, gave him the Trunk, or Portmantua, for it was like a Trunk, and wrapt it about with an old Apron, and he went directly to his Boat with it, and I after him, no Body asking us the least Question about it; as for the drunken Dutch Footman he was still a sleep, and his Master with other Foreign Gentlemen at Supper, and very merry below; so I went clean off with it to Ipswich, and going in the Night, the People of the House knew nothing, but that I was gone to London, by the Harwich Wherry as I had told my Landlady. Trunk, as I call'd it, and would open, and search it; I was willing I told them, they should Search it, but my Husband had the Key, and that he was not yet come from Harwich; this I said, that if upon searching it, they should find all the things be such, as properly belong'd to a Man rather than a Woman, it should not seem strange to them; however they being positive to open the Trunk, I consented to have it broken open, that is to say, to have the Lock taken off, which was not difficult. but they discover'd several Things much to my Satisfaction, as particularly a Parcel of Money in French Pistoles, and some Dutch Ducatoons, or Rix Dollars, and the rest was chiefly two Perriwigs, wearing Linnen, Rasors, Wash- Balls, Perfumes and other useful Things Necessary for a Gentleman; which all pass'd for my Husband's, and so I was quit of them. what Course to take; for I made no Doubt but I should be pursu'd in the Morning, and perhaps be taken with the things about me; so I resolv'd upon taking new Measures; I went publickly to an Inn in the Town with my Trunk, as I call'd it, and having taken the Substance out, I did not think the Lumber of it worth my concern; however, I gave it the Landlady of the House with a Charge to take Care of it, and lay it up safe till I should come again, and away I walk'd into the Street. antient Woman who had just open'd her Door, and I fell into Chat with her, and ask'd her a great many wild Questions of things all remote to my Purpose and Design, but in my Discourse I found by her how the Town was situated, that I was in a Street which went out towards Hadly; but that such a Street went towards the Waterside, such a Street went into the Heart of the Town; and at last such a Street went towards Colchester, and so the London Road lay there. London Road, and away I walk'd as fast as I could; not that I intended to go on Foot, either to London or to Colchester, but I wanted to get quietly away from Ipswich. was busy about some Husbandry work I did not know what; and I ask'd him a great many Questions first, not much to the purpose; but at last told him I was going for London, and the Coach was full, and I cou'd not get a Passage, and ask'd him if he cou'd not tell me where to hire a Horse that would carry double, and an honest Man to ride before me to Colchester, so that I might get a Place there in the Coaches; the honest Clown look'd earnestly at me, and said nothing for above half a Minute; when scratching his Pole, a Horse say you, and to Colchester to carry double; why yes Mistress, alack-a-day, you may have have Horses enough for Money; well Friend, says I, that I take for granted, I don't expect it without Money: Why but Mistress, says he, how much are you willing to give? nay, says I again, Friend, I don't know what your Rates are in the Country here, for I am a Stranger; but if you can get one for me, get it as Cheap as you can, and I'll give you somewhat for your Pains. neither, said I, to myself, if thou knewest all; why Mistress, says he, I have a Horse that will carry Double, and I don't much care if I go myself with you; an you like: Will you, says I? well I believe you are an honest Man, if you, will, I shall be glad of it, I'll pay you in Reason; why look ye Mistress, says he, I won't be out of Reason with you, then if I carry you to Colechester, it will be worth five Shillings for myself and my Horse, for I shall hardly come back to Night. upon the Road, I do not remember the Name of it, but it stands upon a River, I pretended myself very ill, and I could go no farther that Night, but if he would stay there with me, because I was a Stranger I would pay him for himself, and his Horse with all my Heart. be upon the Road that Day, either in the Stage Coaches, or riding Post; and I did not know but the drunken Fellow, or some body else that might have seen me at Harwich, might see me again, and I thought that in one Days stop they would be all gone by. when I set out, so that it was near Ten a-Clock by that time I got to Colechester: It was no little Pleasure that I saw the Town, where I had so many pleasant Days, and I made many Enquires after the good old Friends, I had once had there, but could make little out, they were all dead or remov'd: The young Ladies had been all married or gone to London; the old Gentleman, and the old Lady that had been my early Benefactress all dead; and which troubled me most the young Gentleman my first Lover, and after wards my Brother-in-Law was dead; but two Sons Men grown, were left of him, but they too were Transplanted to London. in Colechester, and then took a Passage in a Waggon, because I would not venture being seen in the Harwich Coaches; but I needed not have used so much Caution, for there was no Body in Harwich, but the Woman of the House, could have known me; nor was it rational to think that she, considering the hurry she was in, and that she never saw me but once, and that by Candle light, should have ever discover'd me. Adventure, I got something considerable, yet I was not fond of any more Country rambles; nor should I have ventur'd Abroad again if I had carried the Trade on to the End of my Days; I gave my Governess a History of my Travels, she lik'd the Harwich Journey well enough, and in Discoursing of these things between our selves she observ'd, that a Thief being a Creature that Watches the Advantages of other Peoples mistakes, 'tis impossible but that to one that is vigilant and industrious many Opportunities must happen, and therefore she thought that one so exquisitely keen in the Trade as I was, would scarce fail of something where ever I went. useful to honest People, and afford a due Caution to People of some sort, or other to Guard against the like Surprizes, and to have their Eyes about them when they have to do with Strangers of any kind, for 'tis very seldom that some Snare or other is not in their way.  The Moral indeed of all my History is left to be gather'd by the Senses and Judgment of the Reader; I am not Qualified to preach to them, let the Experience of one Creature compleatly Wicked, and compleatly Miserable, be a Storehouse of useful warning to those that read. hardened by a long Race of Crime, and Success unparalell'd, I had, as I have said, no thoughts of laying down a Trade, which if I was to judge by the Example of others, must however End at last in Misery and Sorrow. long Train of Wickedness, I went Abroad to see what might offer in my way; when going by a Working Silver Smith's in Foster-lane, I saw a tempting Bait indeed, and not to be resisted by one of my Occupation; for the Shop had no Body in it, and a great deal of loose Plate lay in the Window, and at the Seat of the Man, who I suppose Work'd at one side of the Shop. and might have done it, and carried it clear off, for any care that the Men who belong'd to the Shop had taken of it; but an officious Fellow in a House, on the other Side of the Way, seeing me go in, and that there was no Body in the Shop, comes running over the Street, and without asking me what I was, or who, seizes upon me, and cries out for the People of the House. running over, I had so much presence of Mind, as to knock very hard with my Foot on the Floor of the House, and was just calling out too, when the Fellow laid Hands on me. he laid Hands on me, I stood very high upon it, that I came in, to buy half a Dozen of silver Spoons, and to my good Fortune, it was a Silver-smith's that sold Plate, as well as work'd Plate, for other Shops: The Fellow laugh'd at that Part, and put such a value upon the Service that he had done his Neighbour, that he would have it be, that I came not to buy, but to steal, and raising a great Crowd, I said to the Master of the Shop, who by this time was fetch'd Home from some Neighbouring Place, that it was in vain to make a Noise, and enter into Talk there of the Case; the Fellow had insisted, that I came to steal, and he must prove it, and I desir'd we might go before a Magistrate without any more Words; for I began to see I should be too hard for the Man that had seiz'd me. from tother side of the Way; and the Man said, Mistress you might come into the Shop with a good Design for ought I know; but it seem'd a dangerous thing for you to come into such a Shop as mine is, when you see no Body there, and I cannot do so little Justice to my Neighbour, who was so kind, as not to acknowledge he had Reason on his Side; tho' upon the whole I do not find you attempt'd to take any thing, and I really know not what to do in it: I press'd him to go before a Magistrate with me, and if any thing cou'd be prov'd on me, that was like a design, I should willingly submit, but if not I expected reparation. the Door, came by Sir T. B. an Alderman of the City, and Justice of the Peace, and the Goldsmith hearing of it, entreated his Worship to come in and decide the Case. and Moderation, and the Fellow that had come over, and seiz'd upon me, told his with as much Heat, and foolish Passion, which did me good still: It came then to my turn to speak, and I told his Worship that I was a Stranger in London, being newly come out of the North, that I Lodg'd in such a Place, that I was passing this Street, and went into a Goldsmith's Shop to buy half a Dozen of Spoons, by great good Luck I had an old silver Spoon in my Pocket, which I pull'd out, and told him I had carried that Spoon to match it with half a Dozen of new ones, that it might match some I had in the Country. the People hear, and had also call'd aloud with my Voice: 'Tis true, there was loose Plate in the Shop, but that no Body cou'd say I had touch'd any of it; that a Fellow came running into the Shop out of the Street, and laid Hands on me in a furious manner, in the very Moment, while I was calling for the People of the House; that if he had really had a mind to have done his Neighbour any Service, he should have stood at a distance, and silently watch'd to see whether I had touc'd any thing, or no, and then have taken me in the Fact: That is very true, says Mr. Alderman, and turning to the Fellow that stopt me, he ask'd him if it was true that I knock'd with my Foot? he said yes I had knock'd, but that might be because of his coming; Nay, says the Alderman, taking him short, now you contradict yourself, for just now you said, she was in the Shop with her back to you, and did not see you till you came upon her; now it was true, that my back was partly to the Street, but yet as my Business was of a kind that requir'd me to have Eyes every way, so I really had a glance of him running over, as I said before, tho' he did not perceive it. Neighbour was under a Mistake, and that I was Innocent, and the Goldsmith acquiesc'd in it too, and his Wife, and so I was dismiss'd; but as I was going to depart, Mr. Alderman said, but hold Madam, if you were designing to buy Spoons I hope you will not let my Friend here lose his Customer by the Mistake: I readily answer'd, no Sir, I'll buy the Spoons still if he can Match my odd Spoon, which I brought for a Pattern, and the Goldsmith shew'd me some of the very same Fashion; so he weigh'd the Spoons, and they came to five and thirty Shillings, so I pulls out my Purse to pay him, in which I had near 20 Guineas, for I never went without such a Sum about me, what ever might happen, and I found it of use at other times as well as now. satisfy'd you were wrong'd, and it was for this Reason, that I mov'd you should buy the Spoons, and staid till you had bought them, for if you had not had Money to pay for them, I should have suspected that you did not come into the Shop to buy, for the sort of People who come upon those Designs that you have been Charg'd with, are seldom troubl'd with much Gold in their Pockets, as I see you are. to my Money, but I hop'd he saw Reason also in the Justice he had done me before; he said, yes he had, but this had confirm'd his Opinion, and he was fully satisfy'd now of my having been injur'd; so I came well off from an Affair, in which I was at the very brink of Destruction. former Danger as I us'd to be, and still pursuing the Art which I had so long been employ'd in, I ventur'd into a House where I saw the Doors open, and furnish'd myself as I thought verily without being perceiv'd, with two Peices of flower'd Silks, such as they call Brocaded Silk, very rich; it was not a Mercers Shop, nor a Warehouse of a Mercer, but look'd like a private Dwelling House, and was it seems Inhabited by a Man that sold Goods for a Weaver to the Mercers, like a Broker or Factor. two Wenches that came open Mouth'd at me just as I was going out at the Door, and one of them pull'd me back into the Room, while the other shut the Door upon me; I would have given them good Words, but there was no room for it; two firery Dragons cou'd not have been more furious, they Tore my Cloaths, Bully'd, and Roar'd, as if they would have murther'd me; the Mistress of the House came next, and then the Master, and all outrageous. were a Temptation to me, that I was poor, and distress'd, and Poverty was what many could not resist, and beg'd him with Tears to have pity on me; the Mistress of the House was mov'd with Compassion, and enclin'd to have let me go, and had almost perswaded her Husband to it also, but the sawcy Wenches were run even before they were sent, and had fetch'd a Constable, and then the Master said, he could not go back, I must go before a Justice, and answer'd his Wife that he might come into Trouble himself if he should let me go. sunk into the Ground; I fell into faintings, and indeed the People themselves thought I would have died, when the Woman argued again for me, and entreated her Husband, seeing they had lost nothing to let me go: I offer'd him to pay for the two Peices whatever the value was, tho' I had not got them, and argu'd that as he had his Goods, and had really lost nothing, it would be cruel to pursue me to Death and have my Blood for the bare Attempt of taking them.  I put the Constable in mind too that I had broke no Doors, nor carried any thing away; and when I came to the Justice, and pleaded there that I had neither broken any thing to get in, nor carried any thing out, the Justice was enclin'd to have releas'd me; but the first sawcy Jade that stop'd me, affirming that I was going out with the Goods, but that she stop'd me and pull'd me back, the Justice upon that point committed me, and I was carried to Newgate; that horrid Place! my very Blood chills at the mention of its Name; the Place, where so many of my Comrades had been lock'd up, and from whence they went to the fatal Tree; the Place were my Mother suffered so deeply, where I was brought into the World, and from whence I expected no Redemption, but by an infamous Death: To conclude, the Place that had so long expected me, and which with so much art and Success I had so long avoided. when I was first brought in, and when I look'd round upon all the horrors of that dismal Place: I look'd on my self as lost, and that I had nothing to think of, but of going out of the World, and that with the utmost Infamy; the hellish Noise, the Roaring, Swearing and Clamour, the Stench and Nastiness, and all the dreadful Afflicting things that I saw there; joyn'd to make the Place seem an Emblem of Hell itself, and a kind of an Entrance into it. mention'd above, from my own Reason, from the Sense of my good Circumstances, and of the many Dangers I had escap'd to leave off while I was well, and how I had withstood them all, and hardened my Thoughts against all Fear; it seem'd to me that I was hurried on by an inevitable Fate to this Day of Misery, and that now I was to Expiate all my Offences at the Gallows, that I was now to give satisfaction to Justice with my Blood, and that I was to come to the last Hour of my Life, and of my wickedness together: These things pour'd themselves in upon my Thoughts in a confus'd manner, and left me overwhelm'd with Melancholly and Despair. me no Satisfaction, no Peace, no not in the least, because, as I said to my self, it was repenting after the Power of farther Sinning was taken away: I seem'd not to Mourn that I had committed such Crimes, and for the Fact, as it was an Offence against God and my Neighbour; but that I was to be punish'd for it; I was a Penitent as I thought, not that I had sinn'd, but that I was to suffer, and this took away all the Comfort of my Repentance in my own Thoughts. Place, and glad I wou'd have been for some time to have died there, tho' I did not consider dying as it ought to be consider'd neither; indeed nothing could be fill'd with more horror to my Immagination than the very Place, nothing was more odious to me than the Company that was there: O! if I had but been sent to any Place in the World, and not to Newgate, I should have thought myself happy. Triumph over me? what! Mrs. Flanders come to Newgate at last? what Mrs. Mary, Mrs. Molly, and after that plain Moll Flanders? They thought the Devil had help'd me they said, that I had reign'd so long: They expected me there many Years ago they said, and was I come at last? then they flouted me with Dejections, welcom'd me to the Place, wish'd me Joy, bid me have a good Heart, not be cast down, things might not be so bad as I fear'd, and the like; then call'd for Brandy, and drank to me; but put it all up to my Score, for they told me I was but just come to the College, as they call'd it, and sure I had Money in my Pocket, tho' they had none. Months; I ask'd her, how the Place look'd to her when she first came into it; just as it did now to me, says she, dreadful and frightful, that she thought she was in Hell, and I believe so still, adds she, but it is natural to me now, I don't disturb myself about it: I suppose says I, you are in no danger of what is to follow: Nay, says she, you are mistaken there I am sure, for I am under Sentence, only I pleaded my Belly, but am no more with Child, then the Judge that try'd me, and I expect to be call'd down next Session; this Calling Down, is calling down to their former Judgement, when a Woman has been respited for her Belly, but proves not to be with Child, or if she has been with Child, and has been brought to Bed. Well says I, and are you thus easy? ay, says she, I can't help myself, what signifyes being sad? If I am hang'd there's an End of me, and away she turn'd Dancing, and Sings as she goes, the following Piece of Newgate Wit,  If I swing by the String, I shall hear the ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 1 Bell ring. And then there's an End of poor Jenny. who shall hereafter fall into the same Misfortune and come to that dreadful Place of Newgate; how Time, Necessity, and Conversing with the Wretches that are there Famillarizes the Place to them; how at last they become reconcil'd to that which at first was the greatest Dread upon their Spirits in the World, and are as impudently Chearful and Merry in their Misery, as they were when out of it. for indeed no Colours can represent that Place to the Life; nor any Soul conceive aright of it, but those who have been Sufferers there: But how Hell should become by degrees so natural, and not only tollerable, but even agreeable, is a thing Unintelligible, but by those who have Experienc'd it, as I have. old Governess, who was surpriz'd at it you may be sure, and spent the Night almost as ill out of Newgate, as I did in it. me, but she saw that was to no purpose, however, as she said, to sink under the Weight, was but to encrease the Weight; she immediately applied herself to all the proper Methods to prevent the Effects of it, which we fear'd; and first she found out the two fiery Jades that had surpriz'd me; she tamper'd with them, persuaded them, offer'd them Money, and in a Word, try'd all imaginable ways to prevent a Prosecution; she offer'd one of the Wenches 100 l. to go away from her Mistress, and not to appear against me; but she was so resolute, that tho' she was but a Servant Maid at 3 l. a Year Wages or thereabouts, she refus'd it, and would have refus'd, as my Governess said she believ'd, if she had offer'd her 500 l. Then she attack'd the other Maid, she was not so hard Hearted as the other; and sometimes seem'd enclin'd to be merciful; but the first Wench kept her up, and would not so much as let my Governess talk with her, but threatn'd to have her up for Tampering with the Evidence. been stol'n, and particularly to his Wife, who was enclin'd at first to have some Compassion for me; she found the Woman the same still, but the Man alledg'd he was bound to Prosecute, and that he should forfeit his Recognizance. of the File, as they call it, and that he should not suffer; but it was not possible to Convince him, that he could be safe any way in the World, but by appearing against me; so I was to have three Witnesses of Fact against me, the Master and his two Maids, that is to say, I was as certain to be cast for my Life, as I was that I was alive, and I had nothing to do, but to think of dying: I had but a sad foundation to build upon for that, as I said before, for all my Repentance appear'd to me to be only the Effect of my fear of Death, not a sincere regret for the wicked Life that I had liv'd, and which had brought this Misery upon me, or for the offending my Creator, who was now suddenly to be my Judge. view and thought of nothing Night or Day, but of Gibbets and Halters, evil Spirits and Devils; it is not to be expressed how I was harrass'd, between the dreadful Apprehensions of Death, and the Terror of my Conscience reproaching me with my past horrible Life. all his Divinity run upon Confessing my Crime, as he call'd it, (tho' he knew not what I was in for) making a full Discovery, and the like, without which he told me God would never forgive me; and he said so little to the Purpose that I had no manner of Consolation from him; and then to observe the poor Creature preaching Confession and Repentance to me in the Morning, and find him drunk with Brandy by Noon; this had something in it so shocking, that I began to nauseate the Man, and his Work too by Degrees, for the sake of the Man; so that I desired him to trouble me no more. Governess I had no Bill preferr'd against me the first Sessions, I mean to the Grand Jury, at Guild Hall; so I had another Month, or five Weeks before me, and without Doubt this ought to have been accepted by me, as so much Time given me for Reflection upon what was past, and Preparation for what was to come; I ought to have esteem'd it, as a Space given me for Repentance, and have employ'd it as such; but it was not in me, I was sorry ( as before ) for being in Newgate, but had few Signs of Repentance about me. peterifies, and turns into Stone whatever they are suffer'd to drop upon; so the continual conversing with such a Crew of Hell-Hounds had the same common Operation upon me, as upon other People; I degenerated into Stone, I turn'd first Stupid and Senseless, and then Brutish and Thoughtless, and at last raving Mad as any of them were; in short, I became as naturally pleas'd and easy with the Place, as if indeed I had been Born there. much Degeneracy, as to make that pleasant and agreeable that in it self is the most compleat Misery.  Here was a Circumstance, that I think it is scarce possible to mention a worse; I was as exquisitely miserable, as it was possible for any one to be, that had Life and Health, and Money to help them as I had. least Power of Reflection left, and had any Sense upon them of the Happiness of this Life, or the Misery of another; I had at first, some Remorse indeed, but no Repentance; I had now, neither Remorse or Repentance: I had a Crime charg'd on me, the Punishment of which was Death; the Proof so Evident, that there was no Room for me, so much as to plead not guilty; I had the Name of an old Offender, so that I had nothing to expect but Death, neither had I myself any thoughts of escaping, and yet a certain strange Lethargy of Soul possess'd me, I had no Trouble, no Apprehensions, no Sorrow about me, the first Surprize was gone; I was, I may well say, I know not how; my Senses, my Reason, nay, my Conscience were all a-sleep; my Course of Life for forty Years had been a horrid Complication of Wickedness; Whoredom, Adultery, Incest, Lying, Theft, and in a Word, every thing but Murther, and Treason, had been my Practice, from the Age of Eighteen, or thereabouts to Threescore; and now I was ingulph'd in the Misery of Punishment, and had an infamous Death at the Door, and yet I had no Sense of my Condition, no Thought of Heaven or Hell, at least, that went any farther than a bare flying Touch, like the Stitch or Pain that gives a Hint and goes off; I neither had a Heart to ask God's Mercy, or indeed to think of it, and in this I think I have given a brief Discription of the compleatest Misery on Earth. become familiar, and I felt no more Uneasiness at the Noise and Clamours of the Prison, than they did who made that Noise; in a Word, I was become a meer Newgate-Bird, as wicked and as outragious any of them; nay, I scarce retain'd the Habit and Custom of good Breeding, and Manners, which all along 'till now run thro' my Conversation: so thoro' a Degeneracy had possessd me, that I was no more the same Thing that I had been, than if I had never been otherwise than what I was now. Surprize, which call'd me back a little to that Thing call'd Sorrow, which, indeed, I began to be past the Sense of before: They told me one Night, that there was brought into the Prison late the Night before, three Highway-Men, who had committed a Robbery somewhere, on Hounslow-Heath, I think it was, and were pursu'd to Uxbridge by the Country, and there taken after a gallant Resistance, in which, many of the Country People were wounded, and some kill'd see these brave, topping Gentlemen that were talk'd up to be such, as their Fellows had not been known, and especially because it was said they would in the Morning be remov'd into the Press Yard, having given Money to the head Master of the Prison, to be allow'd the Liberty of that better Place: So we that were Women plac'd our selves in the Way that we would be sure to see them; but nothing could express the Amazement and Surprize I was in, when the first Man that came out, I knew to be my Lancashire Husband, the same with whom I liv'd so well at Dunstable, and the same who I afterwards saw at Brickill, when I was married to my last Husband, as has been related. do; he did not know me, and that was all the present Relief I had, I quitted my Company, and retir'd as much as that dreadful Place suffers any Body to retire, and cry'd vehemently for a great while; dreadful Creature, that I am, said I, How many poor People have I made Miserable?  How many desperate Wretches have I sent to the Devil? This Gentleman's Misfortunes I plac'd all to my own Account: He had told me at Chester, he was ruin'd by that Match, and that his Fortunes were made desperate on my Account; for that thinking I had been a Fortune he was run into Debt more than he was able to pay; that he would go into the Army, and carry a Musquet, or buy a Horse and take a Tour, as he call'd it; and tho' I never told him that I was a Fortune, and so did not actually deceive him my self, yet I did incourage its having it thought so, and so I was the Occasion originally of his Mischief. stronger Reflections than all that had befallen me before; I griev'd Day and Night, and the more, for that they told me, he was the Captain of the Gang, and that he had committed so many Robberies, that Hind, or Whitney, or the Golden Farmer were Fools to him; that he would surely be hang'd if there were no more Men left in the Country; and that there would abundance of People come in against him. compar'd to this, and I loaded my self with Reproaches on his Account; I bewail'd my Misfortunes, and the Ruin he was now come to, at such a Rate, that I relish'd nothing now, as I did before, and the first Reflections I made upon the horrid Life I had liv'd, began to return upon me, and as these Things return'd, my Abhorrence of the Place, and of the Way of living in it, return'd also; in a Word, I was perfectly chang'd, and become another Body. that the next Sessions there would be a Bill preferr'd to the Grand Jury against me, and that I should be try'd for my Life: My Temper was touch'd before, the wretched Boldness of Spirit, which I had acquir'd, abated, and conscious Guilt began to flow in my Mind: In short, I began to think, and to think indeed is one real Advance from Hell to Heaven; all that harden'd State and Temper of Soul, which I said so much of before, is but a Deprivation of Thought; he that is restor'd to his Thinking, is restor'd to himself. broke out thus; Lord! what will become of me? I shall be cast to be sure, and there is nothing beyond that, but Death! I have no Friends, what shall I do? I shall be certainly Cast! Lord! have Mercy upon me! What will become of me! This was a sad Thought, you will say, to be the first (after so long Time,) that had started in my Soul of that kind, and yet, even this was nothing, but Fright, at what was to come; there was not a Word of sincere Repentance in it all. However, I was dreadfully dejected, and disconsolate to the last Degree; and as I had no Friend to communicate my distress'd Thoughts to, it lay so heavy upon me, that it threw me into Fits, and Swoonings several times a Day. I sent for my old Governess, and she, give her, her Due, acted the Part of a true Friend, she left no Stone unturn'd to prevent the Grand Jury finding the Bill; she went to several of the Jury Men, talk'd with them, and endeavour'd to possess them with favourable Dispositions, on Account that nothing was taken away, and no House broken, & c. but all would not do, the two Wenches swore home to the Fact, and the Jury found the Bill for Robbery and House- breaking, that is for Felony and Burglary. I thought I should have died with the Weight of it: My Governess acted a true Mother to me, she pitty'd me, she cry'd with me, and for me; but she could not help me; and to add to the Terror of it, 'twas the Discourse all over the House, that I should dye for it; I could hear them talk it among themselves very often; and see them shake their Heads, and say they were sorry for it, and the like, as is usual in the Place; but still no Body came to tell me their Thoughts, 'till at last one of the Keepers came to me privately, and said with a Sigh, well Mrs. Flanders, you will be try'd a Friday, (this was but a Wednesday ) what do you intend to do? I turn'd as white as a Clout, and said, God knows what I shall do, for my part I know not what to do; why, says be, I won't Flatter you, I would have you prepare for Death, for I doubt you will be Cast, and as you are an old Offender; I doubt you will find but little Mercy: They say added he, your Case is very plain, and that the Witnesses swear so home against you, there will be no standing it. could not speak a Word good or bad, for a great while; at last I burst out into Tears, and said to him, O Sir, What must I do? Do, says he, send for a Minister, and talk with him; for, indeed Mrs. Flanders, unless you have very good Friends, you are no Woman for this World. thought it so: He left me in the greatest Confusion imaginable, and all that Night I lay awake; and now I began to say my Prayers, which I had scarce done before since my last Husband's Death, or from a little while after; and truly I may well call it, saying my Prayers; for I was in such a Confusion, and had such horror upon my Mind, that tho' I cry'd, and repeated several times the Ordinary Expression of, Lord have Mercy upon me; I never brought myself to any Sense of being a miserable Sinner, as indeed I was, and of Confessing my Sins to God, and begging Pardon for the sake of Jesus Christ; I was overwhelm'd with the Sense of my Condition, being try'd for my Life, and being sure to be Executed, and on this Account, I cry'd out all Night, Lord! what will become of me?  Lord! what shall I do? Lord have have mercy upon me, and the like. deal more truly Penitent; tho' she had no prospect of being brought to a Sentence, not but that she deserv'd it as much as I, and so she said herself; but she had not done any thing for many Years, other than receiving what I, and others had stolen, and encouraging us to steal it: But she cry'd and took on, like a distracted Body, wringing her Hands, and crying out that she was undone, that she believ'd there was a Curse from Heaven upon her, that she should be damn'd, that she had been the Destruction of all her Friends, that she brought such a one, and such a one, and such one to the Gallows; and there she reckon'd up ten or eleven People, some of which I have given an Account of that came to untimely Ends, and that now she was the occasion of my Ruin, for she had persuaded me to go on, when I would have left off: I interrupted her there; no Mother, no, said I, don't speak of that, for you would have had me left off when I got the Mercer's Money again, and when I came home from Harwich, and I would not hearken to you, therefore you have not been to blame, it is I only have ruin'd myself, I have brought myself to this Misery, and thus we spent many Hours together. I was carried down to the Sessions-House, where I was arraign'd, as they call'd it, and the next Day I was appointed to be Try'd. At the Arraignment I plead not guilty, and well I might, for I was indicted for Felony and Burglary; that is for feloniously stealing two Peices of Brocaded Silk, value 46 l. the Goods of Anthony Johnson, and for breaking open the Doors; whereas I knew very well they could not pretend I had broken up the Doors, or so much as lifted up a Latch. Crying for two or three Days before, that I slept better the Thursday Night than I expected, and had more Courage for my Tryal, than I thought possible for me to have. they told me the Witnesses must be heard first, and then I should have time to be heard. The Witnesses were the two Wenches, a Couple of hard Mouth'd Jades indeed, for tho' the thing was Truth in the main, yet they aggravated it to the utmost extremity, and swore I had the Goods wholly in my possession, that I had hid them among my Cloaths, that I was going off with them, that I had one Foot over the Threshold when they discover'd themselves, and then I put tother over, so that I was quite out of the House in the Street with the Goods before they took me, and then they seiz'd me, and took the Goods upon me: The Fact in general was true, but I insisted upon it, that they stop'd me before I had set my Foot clear of the Threshold; but that did not argue much, for I had taken the Goods and was bringing them waay, if I had not been taken. was open, and I went in with Design to buy, if seeing no Body in the House, I had taken any of them up in my Hand, it cou'd not be concluded that I intended to steal them, for that I never carried them farther then the Door to look on them with the better Light. my intending to buy the Goods, that being no Shop for the Selling of any thing, and as to carrying them to the Door to look at them, the Maids made their impudent Mocks upon that, and spent their Wit upon it very much; told the Court I had look'd at them sufficiently, and approv'd them very well, for I had pack'd them up, and was a going with them. which was but small Comfort to me, the first bringing me to a Sentence of Death, and the last would have done no more: The next Day, I was carried down to receive the dreadful Sentence, and when they came to ask me what I had to say, why Sentence should not pass, I stood mute a while, but some Body prompted me aloud to speak to the Judges, for that they could represent things favourably for me: This encourag'd me, and I told them I had nothing to say to stop the Sentence; but that I had much to say, to bespeak the Mercy of the Court, that I hop'd they would allow something in such a Case, for the Circumstances of it, that I had broken no Doors, had carried nothing off, that no Body had lost any thing; that the Person whose Goods they were, was pleas'd to say, he desir'd Mercy might be shown, which indeed he very honestly did, that at the worst it was the first Offence, and that I had never been before any Court of Justice before; and in a Word, I spoke with more Courage than I thought I cou'd have done, and in such a moving Tone, and tho' with Tears, that I cou'd see it mov'd others to Tears that heard me. all that I would, but saying neither Yes, or No to it, Pronounc'd the Sentence of Death upon me; a Sentence to me like Death itself, which confounded me; I had no more Spirit left in me, I had no Tongue to speak, or Eyes to look up either to God or Man. before, wanted Comfort now herself, and sometimes Mourning, sometimes Raging, was as much out of herself as any mad Woman in Bedlam: Nor was she only Disconsolate as to me, but she was struck with Horror at the Sense of her own wicked Life, and began to look back upon it with a Taste quite different from mine; for she was Penitent to the highest Degree for her Sins, as well as Sorrowful for the Misfortune: She sent for a Minister too, a serious pious good Man, and apply'd herself with such earnestness by his assistance to the Work of a sincere Repentance, that I believe, and so did the Minister too, that she was a true Penitent, and which is still more, she was not only so for the Occasion, and at that Juncture, but she continu'd so, as I was inform'd to the Day of her Death. had nothing before me but Death; and as I had no Friends to assist me, I expected nothing but to find my Name in the Dead Warrant, which was to come for the Execution next Friday, of five more and myself. her request came to visit me: He exhorted me seriously to repent of all my Sins, and to dally no longer with my Soul; not flattering myself with hopes of Life, which he said, he was inform'd there was no room to expect, but unfeign'dly to look up to God with my whole Soul, and to cry for Pardon in the Name of Jesus Christ.  He back'd his Discourses with proper Quotations of Scripture, encouraging the greatest Sinner to repent, and turn from their evil Way, and when he had done, he kneeled down and pray'd with me. I now began to look back upon my past Life with abhorrence, and having a kind of View into the other Side of Time, the Things of Life, as I believe they do with every Body at such a Time, began to look with a different Aspect, and quite another Shape, than they did before: The Views of felicity, the joy, the Griefs of Life were quite other Things; and I had nothing in my Thoughts, but was so infinitely Superiour to what I had known in Life, that it appear'd to be the greatest stupidity to lay a Weight upon any thing tho' the most valuable in this World. Additions, and I had such extended Notions of it, that I know not how to express them: Among the rest, how absurd did every pleasant Thing look? I mean, that we had counted pleasant before; when I reflected that these sordid Trifles were the things for which we forfeited eternal Felicity. wretched Behaviour in my past Life; that I had forfeited all hope of Happiness in the Eternity that I was just going to enter into; and on the Contrary, was entitled to all that was miserable; and all this with the frightful Addition of its being also Eternal. relate this in the very manner in which things then appear'd to me, as far as I am able; but infinitely short of the lively impressions which they made on my Soul at that time; indeed those Impressions are not to be explain'd by words, or if they are, I are not Mistress of Words to express them; It must be the Work of every sober Reader to make just Reflections, as their own Circumstances may direct; and, this is what every one at sometime or other may feel something of; I mean a clearer Sight into things to come, than they had here, and a dark view of their own Concern in them. as I thought convenient, in what State I found myself as to the Sight I had of things beyond Life; he told me he did not come as Ordinary of the Place, whose business it is to extort Confessions from Prisoners, for the farther detecting of other Offenders; that his business was to move me to such freedom of Discourse as might serve to disburthen my own Mind, and furnish him to administer Comfort to me as far as was in his Power; assur'd me, that whatever I said to him should remain with him, and be as much a Secret as if it was known only to God and myself; and that he desir'd to know nothing of me, but to qualifie him to give proper Advice to me, and to pray to God for me. Passions: He broke into my very Soul by it; and I unravell'd all the Wickedness of my Life to him: In a word, I gave him an Abridgement of this whole History; I gave him the Picture of my Conduct for 50 Years in Minature. Repentance, explain'd to me what he meant by Repentance, and then drew out such a Scheme of infinite Mercy, proclaim'd from Heaven to Sinners of the greatest Magnitude that he left me nothing to say, that look'd like despair or doubting of being accepted, and in this Condition he left me the first Night. explaining the Terms of Divine Mercy, which according to him consisted of nothing more Difficult, than that of being sincerely desirous of it, and willing to accept it; only a sincere Regret for, and hatred of those things, which render'd me so just an Object of divine Vengeance: I am not able to repeat the excellent Discourses of this extraordinary Man; all that I am able to do, is to say, that he reviv'd my Heart, and brought me into such a Condition, that I never knew any thing of in my Life before: I was cover'd with Shame and Tears for things past, and yet had at the same time a secret surprizing Joy at the Prospect of being a true Penitent, and obtaining the Comfort of a Penitent, I mean the hope of being forgiven; and so swift did Thoughts circulate, and so high did the impressions they had made upon me run, that I thought I cou'd freely have gone out that Minute to Execution, without any uneasiness at all, casting my Soul entirely into the Arms of infinite Mercy as a Penitent. saw these things had on me, that he blessed God he had come to visit me, and resolv'd not to leave me till the last Moment. order'd for Execution, and then the Dead Warrant, as they call it, came down, and I found my Name was among them; a terrible blow this was to my new Resolutions, indeed my Heart sunk within me, and I swoon'd away twice, one after another, but spoke not a word: The good Minister was sorely Afflicted for me, and did what he could to comfort me with the same Arguments, and the same moving Eloquence that he did before, and left me not that Evening so long as the Prison-keepers would suffer him to stay in the Prison, unless he wou'd be lock'd up with me all Night, which he was not willing to be. the Day before the time appointed for Execution; and I was greatly discourag'd, and dejected, and indeed almost sunk for want of that Comfort, which he had so often, and with such Success yielded me in his former Visits; I waited with great impatience, and under the greatest oppressions of Spirits imaginable till about four a-Clock; when he came to my Apartment, for I had obtain'd the Favour by the help of Money, nothing being to be done in that Place without it, not to be kept in the Condemn'd Hole, among the rest of the Prisoners, who were to die, but to have a little dirty Chamber to my self. even before I saw him; but let any one Judge what kind of Motion I found in my Soul, when after having made a short excuse for his not coming, he shew'd me that his time had been employ'd on my Account; that he had obtained a favourable Report from the Recorder in my Case, and in short that he had brought me a Reprieve. have been double Cruelty to have conceal'd; for as grief had overset me before, so Joy overset now, and I fell into a more dangerous Swooning than at first, and it was not without Difficulty that I was recover'd at all. the Joy of my Reprieve, put the Remembrance of my past Sorrow out of my Mind, and told me, that he must leave me, to go and enter the Reprieve in the Books, and show it to the Sheriffs, he stood up just before his going away, and in a very earnest Manner pray'd to God, for me, that my Repentance might be made Unfeign'd and Sincere; and that my coming back as it were into Life again, might not be a returning to the Follies of Life, which I had made such solemn Resolutions to forsake; I joyn'd heartily in that Petition, and must needs say, I had deeper Impressions upon my Mind all that Night, of the Mercy of God in sparing my Life; and a greater Detestation of my Sins, from a Sense of that goodness than I had in all my Sorrow before. this Book; Particularly, I reflect that many of those who may be pleas'd and diverted with the Relation of the wicked part of my Story, may not relish this, which is really the best part of my Life, the most Advantageous to my self, and the most instructive to others; such however will I hope allow me liberty to make my Story compleat: It would be a severe Satyr on such, to say they do not relish the Repentance as much as they do the Crime; and they had rather the History were a compleat Tragedy, as it was very likely to have been. indeed in the Prison; the first thing I was saluted with in the Morning, was the Tolling of the great Bell at St. Sepulchre's, which usher'd in the Day: As soon as it began to Toll, a dismal groaning and crying was heard from the Condemn'd Hole, where there lay six poor Souls, who were to be Executed that Day, some for one Crime, some for another, and two for Murther. Prisoners, expressing their aukward Sorrows for the poor Creatures that were to die, but in a manner extreamly differing one from another; some cried for them; some Brutishly huzza'd, and wish'd them a good Journey; some damn'd and curst those that had brought them to it; many pitying them; and some few, but but very few praying for them. me to bless the merciful Providence that had as it were snatch'd me out of the Jaws of this Destruction: I remained as it were Dumb and Silent, overcome with the Sense of it, and not able to express what I had in my Heart; for the Passions on such Occasions as these, are certainly so agitated as not to be able presently to regulate their own Motions. the Ordinary as they call him, was busy with them, disposing them to submit to their Sentence: I say all this while I was seiz'd with a fit of trembling, as much as I cou'd have been, if I had been in the same Condition, as I was the Day before; I was so violently agitated by this Surprising Fit, that I shook as if it had been in an Ague; so that I could not speak or look, but like one Distracted: As soon as they were all put into the Carts and gone, which however I had not Courage enough to see, I say, as soon as they were gone, I fell into a fit of crying involuntarily, as a meer Distemper, and yet so violent, and it held me so long, that I knew not what Course to take, nor could I stop, or put a Checque to it, no, not with all the Strength and Courage I had. they were all out of the World, and then a most humble Penitent serious kind of Joy succeeded; a real transport it was, or Passion of Thankfulness, and in this I continu'd most part of the Day. good Discourses, he Congratulated my having a space yet allow'd me for Repentance, whereas the State of those six poor Creatures was determin'd, and they were now past the Offers of Salvation; he press'd me to retain the same Sentiments of the things of Life, that I had when I had a View of Eternity; and at the End of all, told me that I should not conclude that all was over, that a Reprieve was not a Pardon, that he could not answer for the Effects of it; however I had this Mercy, that I had more Time given me, and it was my Business to improve that Time. the Affair would have a tragical Issue still, which however he had no Certainty of, yet I did not at that time question him about it, he having said he would do his utmost to bring it to a good End, and that he hop'd he might, but he would not have me be Secure; and the Consequence shew'd that he had Reason for what he said. that I should be included in the Dead Warrant at the ensuing Sessions; and it was not without great Difficulty, and at last an humble Petition for Transportation, that I avoided it; so ill was I beholding to Fame, and so prevailing was the Report of being an old offender, tho' in that they did not do me strict Justice, for I was not in the Sense of the Law an old Offender, what ever I was in the Eye of the Judge; for I had never been before them in a judicial way before, so the Judges could not charge me with being an old Offender, but the Recorder was pleas'd to represent my Case as he thought fit. being order'd for Transportation, which was, I say, a hard condition in it self, but not when comparatively consider'd; and therefore I shall make no Comments upon the Sentence, nor upon the Choice I was put too; we all shall choose any thing rather than Death, especially when 'tis attended with an uncomfortable Prospect beyond it, which was my Case. me the reprieve, mourn'd sincerely for his part; he was in Hopes, he said, that I should have ended my Days under the Influence of good Instruction, that I might not have forgot my former Distresses, and that I should not have been turn'd loose again among such a wretched Crew as are thus sent Abroad, where, he said, I must have more than ordinary secret Assistance from the Grace of God, if I did not turn as wicked again as ever. dangerously Sick, and being in as near a View of Death, by her Disease, as I was by my Sentence, was a very great Penitent; I say, I have not mention'd her, nor indeed did I see her in all this Time, but being now recovering, and just able to come Abroad, she came to see me. and Hopes I had been agitated with; I told her, what I had escap'd, and upon what Terms; and she was present, when the Minister express'd his Fears of my relapsing again into wickedness upon my falling into the wretch'd Company, that are generally transported: Indeed I had a melancholly Reflection upon it in my own Mind, for I knew what a dreadful Gang was always sent a way together, and said to my Governess, that the good Minister's Fears were not without Cause; Well, well, says she, but I hope you will not be tempted with such a horrid Example as that, and as soon as the Minister was gone, she told me, she would not have me Discourag'd, for perhaps Ways and Means might be found, to dispose of me in a particular Way, by my self, of which she would talk farther with me afterward. usually had done, and I entertain'd immediately a thousand Notions of being deliver'd, but could not for my Life imagine the Methods, or think of one that was feizable; but I was too much concern'd in it, to let her go from me without explaining herself, which tho' she was very loath to do, yet, as I was still pressing, she answer'd me in few Words, thus, Why, you have Money, have you not? Did you ever know one in your Life that was transported, and had a hundred Pound in his Pocket, I'll warrant ye Child, says she. thing, but a strict Execution of the Order, and as it was a Severity that was esteem'd a Mercy, there was no Doubt but it would be strictly observ'd; she said no more but this, we will try what can be done, and so we parted. was, I know not, but at the End of this Time I was put on Board of a Ship in the Thames, and with me a Gang of Thirteen, as harden'd vile Creatures as ever Newgate produc'd in my Time; and it would really well take up a History longer than mine to describe the Degrees of Impudence, and audacious Villany that those Thirteen were arriv'd to, and the manner of their behaviour in the Voyage; of which I have a very diverting Account by me, which the Captain of the Ship, who carry'd them over gave me, and which he caus'd his Mate to Write down at large. the little Incidents which attended me in this Interval of my Circumstances; I mean, between the final Order for my Transportation, and the Time of going on Board the Ship, and I am too near the End of my Story, to allow Room for it, but something relating to me and my Lancashire Husband, I must not omit. of the ordinary Prison into the Press-Yard, with three of his Comrades, for they found another to add to them after some Time; here, for what Reason I knew not, they were kept without being brought to a Tryal almost three Months, it seems they found Means to Bribe or Buy off some who were to come in against them, and they wanted Evidence to convict them: After some puzzle on this Account, they made shift to get Proof enough against two of them, to carry them off, but the other two, of which my Lancashire Husband was one, lay still in Suspence: They had I think one positive Evidence against each of them; but the Law obliging them to have two Witnesses, they could make nothing of it; yet they were resolv'd not to part with the Men neither, not doubting but Evidence would at last come in; and in Order to this, I think Publication was made, that such Prisoners were taken, and any one might come to the Prison and see them. robb'd in the Dunstable Coach, and that I would go to see the two Highway- Men; but when I came into the Press Yard, I so disguis'd my self, and muffled my Face up so, that he could see little of me, and knew nothing of who I was, but when I came back, I said publickly that I knew them very well. Evidence against one of the Highway-Men, and that I was to come off by it from the Sentence of Transportation. Flanders that knew him so well, and was to be an Evidence against him, and accordingly, I had leave to go to him: I dress'd myself up as well as the best Cloaths that I suffer'd myself ever to appear in there, would allow me, and went to the Press-Yard, but had a Hood over my Face; he said little to me at first, but ask'd me if I Knew him; I told him, yes, very well; but as I conceal'd my Face, so I Counterfeited my Voice too, that he had no Guess at who I was: He ask'd me where I had seen him, I told him between Dunstable and Brickhill, but turning to the Keeper that stood by, I ask'd if I might not be admitted to talk with him alone, he said, yes, yes, and so very civily withdrew. bursting out into Tears, my Dear; said I, do you know me? He turn'd pale and stood Speechless, like one Thunder struck, and not able to conquer the Surprize, said no more but this, let me sit down; and sitting down by the Table, leaning his Head on his Hand, fix'd his Eyes on the Ground as one stupid: I cry'd so vehemently on the other Hand, that it was a good while e'er I could speak any more; but after I had given vent to my Passion, I repeated the same Words: My Dear, Do you not know me? At which he answer'd, Yes, and said no more a good while. Eyes towards me and said, How could you be so Cruel? I did not readily understand what he meant; and I answer'd, How can you call me Cruel? To come to me, says he, in such a Place as this, is it not to insult me, I have not robb'd you, at least not on the Highway? was in, and thought that having got Intelligence of his being there, I had come to upbraid him with his leaving me; but I had too much to say to him to be affronted, and told him in few Words, that I was far from coming to insult him, but at best I came to Condole mutually; that he would be easily satisfy'd, that I had no such View, when I should tell him that my Condition was worse than his, and that many ways: He look'd a little concern'd at the Expression of my condition being worse than his; but with a kind of a smile, said How can that be? when you see me Fetter'd, and in Newgate, and two of my Companions Executed already; can you say your Condition is worse than Mine. to relate, or you to hear my unfortunate History; but if you will hear it, you will soon conclude with me that my Condition is worse than yours: How is that possible, says he, when I expect to be cast for my Life the very next Sessions? Yes says I, 'tis very possible when I shall tell you that I have been cast for my Life three Sessions ago, and am now under Sentence of Death, is not my Case worse than yours? little while he starts up, unhappy Couple! says he, How can this be possible?  I took him by the Hand, come My Dear, said I, sit down, and let us compare our Sorrows: I am a Prisoner in this very House, and in a much worse Circumstance than you, and you will be satisfy'd I do not come to Insult you, when I tell you the particulars; and with this we sat down together, and I told him so much of my Story as I thought convenient, bringing it at last to my being reduc'd to great Poverty, and representing myself as fallen into some Company that led me to relieve my Distresses by a way that I had been utterly unacquainted with, and that they making an attempt on a Tradesman's House I was seiz'd upon, for having been but just at the Door, the Maid-Servant pulling me in; that I neither had broke any Lock, or taken any thing away, and that notwithstanding, that I was brought in Guilty, and Sentenc'd to Die; but that the Judges having been made sensible of the Hardship of my Circumstances, had obtain'd leave for me to he transported. Flanders, who was a famous successful Thief, that all of them had heard of, but none of them had ever seen, but that as he knew, was none of my Name; but I plac'd all to the account of my ill Fortune, and that under this Name I was dealt with as an old Offender, tho' this was the first thing they had ever known of me: I gave him a long Account of what had befallen me, since I saw him; but told him I had seen him since, he might think I had; then gave him an Account how I had seen him at Brickhill; how he was pursued, and how by giving an Account that I knew him, and that he was a very honest Gentleman, the Heu and Cry was stopp'd, and the High constable went back again. particulars, being all of them infinitely below what he had been at the Head of; but when I came to the Story of little Brickhill, he was surpriz'd, and was it you my Dear, said he, that gave the Check to the Mob, at Brickhill: Yes said I, it was I indeed, then I told him the particulars which I had observ'd of him there. Why then said he, it was you that sav'd my Life at that time, and I am glad I owe my Life to you, for I will pay the Debt to you now, and I'll deliver you from the present Condition you are in, or I will die in the attempt. the hazzard of, and for a Life not worth his saving; 'twas no matter for that he said, it was a Life worth all the World to him; a Life that had given him a new Life; for says he, I was never in real Danger, but that time; till the last Minute when I was taken: Indeed his Danger then lay in his believing he had not been pursu'd that way; for they had gone off from Hockley quite another way, and had come over the enclos'd Country into Brickhill, and were sure they had not been seen by any Body. strange History, and be infinitely diverting: He told me that he took the Road about twelve Year before he marry'd me; that the Woman which call'd him Brother, was not any Kin to him; but one that belong'd to their Gang, and who keeping Correspondence with them, liv'd always in Town, having great Acquaintance, that she gave them perfect Intelligence of Persons going out of Town, and that they had made several good Booties by her Correspondence; that she thought she had fix'd a Fortune for him, when she brought me to him, but happen'd to be Disappointed, which he really could not blame her for: That, if I had had an Estate, which she was inform'd I had, he had resolv'd to leave off the Road, and live a new Life, but never to appear in Publick till some general Pardon had been pass'd, or 'till he could, for Money have got his Name into some particular Pardon, so that he might have been perfectly easy, but that as it had prov'd otherwise he was oblig'd to take up the old Trade again. where he robb'd the West Chester Coaches, near Litchfield, when he got a very great Booty; and after that, how he robb'd five Grasiers, in the West, going to Burford Fair in Wiltshire to buy Sheep; he told me he got so much Money on those two Occasions, that if he had known where to have found me, he would certainly have embrac'd my Proposal of going with me to Virginia; or to have settled in a Plantation, on some other of the English Colonies in America. but heard nothing from me: This indeed I knew to be true, but the Letters coming to my Hand in the Time of my latter Husband, I could do nothing in it, and therefore gave no Answer that so he might believe they had miscarried. since, tho' when he had gotten so much Money, he said, he did not run such desperate Risques as he did before; then he gave me some Account of several hard and desperate Encounters which he had with Gentlemen on the Road, who parted too hardly with their Money, and shew'd me some wounds he had receiv'd, and he had one or two very terrible Wounds indeed, particularly one by a Pistol Bullet which broke his Arm; and another with a Sword which run him quite thro' the Body, but that missing his Vitals he was cur'd again; one of his Comrades having kept with him so faithfully, and so friendly, as that he assisted him in riding near 80 Miles before his Arm was Set, and then got a Surgeon in a considerable City, remote from the Place where it was done, pretending they were Gentlemen traveling towards Carlisle, that they had been attack'd on the Road by Highway-Men, and that one of them had shot him into the Arm. but lay still 'till he was cur'd: He gave me also so many distinct Accounts of his Adventures, that it is with great Reluctance, that I decline the relating them; but this is my own Story, not his. was he expected when he came to be try'd; he told me, that they had no Evidence against him; for that of the three Roberries, which they were all Charg'd with, it was his good Fortune, that he was but in one of them, and that there was but one Witness to be had to that Fact, which was not sufficient; but that it was expected some others would come in, and that he thought when he first see me, I had been one that came of that Errand; but that if no Body came in against him, he hop'd he should be clear'd; that he had some intimation, that if he would submit to Transport himself, he might be admitted to it without a Tryal, but that he could not think of it with any Temper, and thought he could much easier submit to be Hang'd. be an Hundred ways for him that was a Gentleman, and a bold enterprizing Man to find his way back again, and perhaps some Ways and Means to come back before he went: He smil'd at that Part, and said he should like the last the best of the two, for he had a kind of Horror upon his Mind at his being sent to the Plantations as the Romans sent Slaves to Work in the Mines; that he thought the Passage into another State, much more tolerable at the Gallows, and that this was the general Notion of all the Gentlemen, who were driven by the Exigence of their Fortunes to take the Road; that at the Place of Execution there was at least an End of all the Miseries of the present State, and as for what was to follow, a Man was in his Opinion, as likely to Repent sincerely in the last Fortnight of his Life under the Agonies of a Goal, and the condemn'd Hole, as he would ever be in the Woods and Wildernesses of America; that Servitude and hard Labour were Things Gentlemen could never stoop to, that it was but the way to force them to be their own Executioners, which was much worse, and that he could not have any Patience when he did but think of it. Womans Rhetorick to it, I mean that of Tears: I told him the Infamy of a publick Execution, was certainly a greater pressure upon the Spirits of a Gentleman, than any Mortifications that he could meet with Abroad; that he had at least in the other, a Chance for his Life, whereas here, he had none at all; that it was the easiest thing in the World for him to manage the Captain of a Ship, who were generally speaking, Men of good Humour, and a small matter of Conduct, especially, if there was any Money to be had, would make way for him to buy himself off, when he came to Virginia. but I was mistaken, his meaning was another way; you hinted just now, my Dear said he, that there might be a way of coming back before I went, by which I understood you, that it might be possible to buy it off here; I had rather give 200 l. to prevent going, than 100 l. to be set at Liberty when I came there, That is my Dear said I, because you do not know the Place so well as I do: That may be, said he, and yet I believe as well as you know it, you would do the same unless it is, because as you told me, you have a Mother there. any other Relations that I might have there, I knew them not: That since my Misfortunes had reduc'd me to the Condition I had been in for some Years, I had not kept up any Correspondence with them; and that he would easily believe, I should find but a cold Reception from them, if I should be put to make my first visit in the Condition of a Transported Felon; that therefore if I went thither, I resolved not to see them; but that I had many Views in going there, which took off all the uneasy Part of it; and if he found himself oblig'd to go also, I should easily Instruct him how to manage himself, so as never to go a Servant at all, especially since I found he was not destitute of Money, which was the only Friend in such a Condition. and told him I hop'd he did not understand by my speaking, that I should expect any supply from him if he had Money; that on the other Hand, tho' I had not a great deal, yet I did not want, and while I had any I would rather add to him, than weaken him, seeing whatever he had, I knew in the Case of Transportation he would have Occasion of it all. what Money he had was not a great deal, but that he would never hide any of it from me if I wanted it; and assur'd me he did not speak with any such Apprehensions; that he was only intent upon what I had hinted to him; that here he knew what to do, but there he should be the most helpless Wretch alive. if he had Money, as I was glad to hear he had, he might not only avoid the Servitude, suppos'd to be the Consequence of Transportation; but begin the World upon such a new Foundation, as he cou'd not fail of Success in, but with the common Application usual in such Cases; that he could not but call to Mind, I had recommended it to him many Years before, and propos'd it for restoring our Fortunes in the World; and I would tell him now, that to convince him both of the certainty of it, and of my being fully acquainted with the Method, and also fully satisfy'd in the probability of Success, he should first see me deliver myself from the Necessity of going over at all, and then that I would go with him freely, and off my own Choice, and perhaps carry enough with me to satisfy him; that I did not offer it, for want of being able to live without Assistance from him; but that I thought our mutual Misfortunes had been such, as were sufficient to Reconcile us both to quitting this part of the World, and living where no Body could upbraid us with what was past, and without the Agonies of a condemn'd Hole to drive us to it, where we should look back on all our past Dissasters with infinite Satisfaction, when we should consider that our Enemies should entirely forget us, and that we should live as new People in a new World, no Body having any thing to say to us, or we to them. own passionate Objections so effectually, that he embrac'd me, and told me, I treated him with such a Sincerity, as overcame him; that he would take my Advice, and would strive to submit to his Fate, in hope of having the Comfort of so faithful a Counsellor, and such a Companion in his Misery; but still he put me in mind of what I had mention'd before; Namely, that there might be some way to get off, before he went, and that it might be possible to avoid going at all, which he said would be much better: I told him he should see, and be fully satisfy'd that I would do my utmost in that Part too, and if it did not succeed, yet that I would make good the rest. and Affection as I thought were Equal, if not Superior to that at our parting at Dunstable; and now I saw more plainly the Reason why he then declin'd coming with me toward London; and why when we parted there, he told me it was not convenient for him to come to London with me, as he would otherwise have done: I have observ'd that the Account of his Life, would have made a much more pleasing History, than this of mine; and indeed nothing in it, was more strange than this Part, ( viz. ) that he carried on that desperate Trade full five and Twenty Year, and had never been taken, the Success he had met with, had been so very uncommon, and such, that sometimes he had liv'd handsomely and retir'd, in one Place for a Year or two at a time, keeping himself and a Man Servant to wait on him, and has often sat in the Coffee-Houses, and heard the very People who he had robb'd give Accounts of their being robb'd, and of the Places and Circumstances, so that he cou'd easily remember that it was the same. unluckily married me for a Fortune: Had I been the Fortune he expected, I verily believe, he would have taken up and liv'd honestly. upon the spot, when the Robbery was done, which they were committed for; and so none of the Persons robb'd cou'd swear to him; but it seems as he was taken, with the Gang, one hard-mouth'd Country Man swore home to him; and according to the Publication they had made, they expected more Evidence against him, and for that Reason he was kept in hold. understood upon the intercession of some great Person who press'd him hard to accept of it; and as he knew there were several that might come in against him, I thought his Friend was in the Right, and I lay at him Night and Day to delay it no longer. therefore admitted to Transportation in Court, and on his Petition as I was, so he found himself under a difficulty to avoid embarking himself as I had said he might have done; his Friend having given Security for him that he should Transport himself, and not return within the Term. my own delieverance, were hereby render'd wholly ineffectual, unless I would abandon him, and leave him to go to America by himself; than which he protested he would much rather go directly to the Gallows. near at Hand; my Governess who continu'd my fast Friend, had try'd to obtain a Pardon, but it could not be done unless with an Expence too heavy for my Purse, considering that to be left empty, unless I had resolv'd to return to my old Trade, had been worse than Transportation, because there I could live, here I could not. The good Minister stood very hard on another Account to prevent my being Transported also; but he was answer'd, that my Life had been given me at his first Solicitations, and therefore he ought to ask no more; he was sensibly griev'd at my going, because, as he said, he fear'd I should lose the good impressions, which a prospect of Death had at first made on me, and which were since encreas'd by his Instructions, and the pious Gentleman was exceedingly concern'd on that Account. my Reasons for it from the Minister, and to the last he did not know, but that I went with the utmost reluctance and affliction. deliver'd to a Merchant hat Traded to Virginia, on board a Ship, riding, in Deptford Reach: The Officer of the Prison deliver'd us on board, and the Master of the Vessel gave a Discharge for us. thought I should have been suffocated for want of Air, and the next Morning the Ship weigh'd, and fell down the River to a Place call'd Bugby's Hole, which was done, as they told us by the agreement of the Merchant, that all Opportunity of Escape should be taken from us: However when the Ship came thither, and cast Anchor, we were permitted to come upon the Deck, but not upon the Quarter-Deck, that being kept particularly for the Captain, and for Passengers perceiv'd they were under Sail, I was at first greatly surpriz'd, fearing we should go away, and that our Friends would not be admitted to see us; but I was easy soon after, when I found they had come to an Anchor, and that we had Notice given by some of the Men, that the next Morning we should have the Liberty to come upon Deck, and to have our Friends come to see us. we had afterwards little Cabins allow'd for such as had any Bedding to lay in them; and room to stow any Box or Trunk for Cloaths, and Linnen if we had it, (which might well be put in) for some of them had neither Shirt or Shift, Linnen or Woollen, but what was on their Backs, or one Farthing of Money to help themselves; yet I did not find but they far'd well enough in the Ship, especially the Women, who got Money of the Seamen for washing their Cloaths, & c. sufficient to purchase any thing they wanted. the Officers, whether I might not be allow'd to send a Letter on Shore to let my Friends know where we lay, and to get some necessary Things sent to me. This was the Boatswain, a very civil courteous Man, who told me I should have any Liberty that I desir'd, that he could allow me with Safety; I told him I desir'd no other; and he answer'd that the Ship's Boat would go up to London next Tide, and he would Order my Letter to be carry'd. Boat was going off, that he went in it himself, and if my Letter was ready, he would take Care of it; I had prepar'd Pen, Ink, and Paper before-hand, and had gotten a Letter ready directed to my Governess, and enclos'd another to my fellow Prisoner, which however I did not let her know was my Husband, not to the last; in that to my Governess, I let her know where the Ship lay, and press'd her to send me what Things she had got ready for me, for my Voyage. I told him was for the Charge of a Porter, which I had entreated him to send with the Letter, as soon as he came on Shore, that if possible I might have an Answer brought back by the same Hand, that I might know what was become of my Things, for, Sir, says I, if the Ship should go away before I have them, I am undone. better Furniture about me, than the ordinary Prisoners, that I had a Purse, and in it a pretty deal of Money, and I found that the very Sight of it, immediately furnish'd me with very different Treatment from what I should otherwise have met with; for tho' he was Courteous indeed before, in a kind of natural Compassion to me, as a Woman in distress; yet he was more than ordinarily so, afterwards, and procur'd me to be better treated in the Ship, than, I say, I might otherwise have been; as shall appear in its Place. brought me back her Answer; and when he gave it me, gave me the Shilling again, there, says he, there's your Shilling again too, for I deliver'd the Letter my self; I could not tell what to say: I was so surpriz'd at the thing; but after some Pause, I said, Sir, you are too kind, it had been but reasonable that you had paid yourself Coach Hire then. Sister? all the Friends I have in the World: Well, says he, there are few such Friends: Why, she crys after you like a Child; Ay, says I again, she would give a Hundred Pound, I believe, to deliver me from this dreadful Condition. a way how to deliver your self, but this he spoke softly that no Body could hear. should be taken again, would cost me my Life: Nay, said he, if you were once out of the Ship, you must look to your self afterwards, that I can say nothing to; so we drop'd the Discourse for that Time. Letter to the Prison to my Husband, and got an Answer to it, and the next Day came down herself, bringing me in the first Place, a Sea Bed, as they call it, and all its ordinary Furniture; she brought me also a Sea Chest, that is, a Chest, such as are made for Seamen with all the Conveniencies in it, and fill'd with every thing almost that I could want; and in one of the Corners of the Chest, where there was a private Drawer, was my Bank of Money, that is to say, so much of it as I had resolv'd to carry with me; for I order'd part of my Stock to be left behind, to be sent afterwards in such Goods as I should want when I came to settle; for Money in that Country, is not of much Use where all things are bought for Tobacco, much more is it a great Loss to carry it from Hence. Money or Goods, and for a poor Convict that was to be sold as soon as I came on Shore, to carry a Cargo of Goods would be to have Notice taken of it, and perhaps to have them seiz'd; so I took part of my Stock with me thus, and left the rest with my Governess. for me to appear too Well, at least, till I knew what kind of a Captain we should have: When she came into the Ship, I thought she would have died indeed; her Heart sunk at the Sight of me, and at the Thoughts of parting with me in that Condition, and she cry'd so intolerably, I could not for a long time have any talk with her. perplex'd me; he told me it would be impossible for him to be discharg'd time enough for going in the same Ship, and which was more than all, he began to question whether they would give him leave to go in what Ship he pleas'd, tho' he did voluntarily transport himself; but that they would see him put on Board such a Ship as they should direct, and that he would be charg'd upon the Captain as other convict Prisoners were; so that he began to be in Dispair of seeing me till he came to Virginia, which made him almost desperate; seeing that on the other Hand, if I should not be there, if any Accident of the Sea or of Mortality should take me away, he should be the most undone Creature in the World. Governess the Story of the Boatswain, and she was mighty eager with me to treat with him; but I had no mind to it, till I heard whether my Husband or fellow Prisoner, so she call'd him, cou'd be at liberty to go with me or no; at last I was forc'd to let her into the whole matter, except only, that of his being my Husband; I told her that I had made a positive Agreement with him to go, if he could get the liberty of going in the same Ship, and I found he had Money. Plant, Settle; and in short, grow Rich without any more Adventures, and as a great Secret, I told her we were to Marry as soon as he came on Board. it her business from that time to get him deliver'd in time, so that he might go in the same Ship with me, which at last was brought to pass, tho' with great difficulty, and not without all the Forms of a Transported Convict, which he really was not, for he had not been try'd, and which was a great Mortification to him: As our Fate was now determin'd, and we were both on Board, actually bound to Virginia, in the despicable Quality of Transported Convicts, destin'd to be sold for Slaves, I for five Year, and he under Bonds and Security not to return to England any more, as long as he liv'd; he was very much dejected and cast down; the Mortification of being brought on Board as he was, like a Prisoner, piqu'd him very much, since it was first told him he should Transport himself, so that he might go as a Gentleman at liberty; it is true he was not order'd to be sold when he came there, as we were, and for that Reason he was oblig'd to pay for his Passage to the Captain, which we were not; as to the rest, he was as much at a loss as a Child what to do with himself, but by Directions. whether I should have my Husband with me or no; and therefore not resolv'd how, or in what manner to receive the honest Boatswain's Proposal, which indeed he thought a little strange. dejected angry Countenance, his great Heart was swell'd with Rage and Disdain; to be drag'd along with three Keepers of Newgate, and put on Board like a Convict, when he had not so much as been brought to a Tryal he made loud complaints of it by his Friends, for it seems had some Interest; but they got some Checque in their Application, and were told he had had Favour enough, and that they had receiv'd such an Account of him since the last Grant of his Transportation, that he ought to think himself very well treated, that he was not prosecuted a new: This answer quieted him, for he knew too much what might have happen'd, and what he had room to expect; and now he saw the goodness of that Advice to him, which prevail'd with him to accept of the offer of Transportation, and after his chagrin at these Hell Hounds, as he call'd them, was a little over, he look'd more compos'd, began to be chearful, and as I was telling him how glad I was to have him once more out of their Hands, he took me in his Arms and acknowledge'd with great Tenderness, that I had given him the best Advice possible: My Dear, says he, Thou hast twice sav'd my Life, from hence forward it shall be employ'd for you, and I'll always take Your Advice. told me his Stock was pretty good when he came into the Prison, but that living there as he did like a Gentleman, and, which was much more, the making of Friends, and soliciting his Case, had been very Expensive; and in a Word, all his Stock left was an Hundred and Eight Pounds, which he had about him in Gold. taken with me; for I was resolv'd what ever should happen, to keep what I had left in Reserve; that in Case I should die, what I had was enough to give him, and what was left in my Governess Hands would be her own, which she had well deserv'd of me indeed. Shillings; so that we had three Hundred fifty four Pound between us, but a worse gotten Estate was never put together, to begin the World with. unprofitable Cargoe to be carryed to the Plantations; I believe his was really all he had left in the World, as he told me it was; But I who had between seven and eight Hundred Pounds in Bank when this Dissaster befel me, and who had one of the faithfulest Friends in the World to manage it for me, considering she was a Woman of no Principles, had still Three Hundred Pounds left in her Hand, which I had reserv'd, as above; besides I had some very valuable things with me, as particularly two gold Watches, some small Peices of Plate, and some Rings; all stolen Goods; with this Fortune, and in the Sixty first Year of my Age, I launch'd out into a new World, as I may call it, in the Condition only of a poor Convict, order'd to be Transported in respite from the Gallows; my Cloaths were poor and mean, but not ragg'd or dirty, and none knew in the whole Ship that I had any thing of value about me. which I had order'd to be pack'd up in two great Boxes, I had them Shipp'd on Board, not as my Goods, but as consign'd to my real Name in Virginia; and had the Bills of Loading in my Pocket; and in these Boxes was my Plate and Watches, and every thing of value, except my Money, which I kept by itself in a private Drawer in my Chest, and which cou'd not be found, or open'd if found without splitting the Chest to peices. embark'd on no Criminal account, and these had Accommodations assign'd them in the great Cabbin, and other Parts of the Ship, whereas we as Convicts were thrust down below, I know not where; but when my Husband came on Board, I spoke to the Boatswain, who had so early given me Hints of his Friendship; I told him he had befriended me in many things, and I had not made any suitable Return to him, and with that I put a Guinea into his Hand; I told him that my Husband was now come on Board, that tho' we were under the present Misfortunes, yet we had been Persons of a differing Character from the wretch'd Crew that we came with, and desir'd to know whether the Captain might not be mov'd, to admit us to some Conveniences in the Ship, for which we would make him what Satisfaction he pleas'd, and that we would gratifie him for his Pains in procuring this for us. He took the Guinea as I cou'd see with great Satisfaction, and assur'd me of his Assistance. best humour'd Gentlemen in the World, would be easily brought to Accommodate us, as well as we cou'd desire, and to make me easie, told me he would go up the next Tide on purpose to speak to him about it: The next Morning happening to sleep a little longer than ordinary, when I got up, and began to look Abroad, I saw the Boatswain among the Men in his ordinary Business; I was a little melancholly at seeing him there, and going forwards to speak to him, he saw me, and came towards me, but not giving him time to speak first, I said smiling, I doubt; Sir you have forgot us, for I see you are very busy; he return'd presently, come along with me, and you shall see, so he took me into the great Cabbin, and there sat a good sort of a Gentlemanly Man writing, and a great many Papers before him. that the Captain spoke to you of; and turning to me, he said, I have been so far from forgetting your Business, that I have been up at the Captain's House, and have represented faithfully what you said, of your being furnish'd with Conveniencies for your self, and your Husband; and the Captain has sent this Gentleman, who is Mate of the Ship down, on purpose to show you every thing, and to Accommodate you to your Content, and bid me assure you, that you shall not be treated like what you were expected to be, but with the same Respect as other Passengers are treated. for his Kindness, confirm'd what the Boatswain had said, and added, that it was the Captain's Delight to shew himself kind, and charitable, especially, to those that were under any Misfortunes, and with that he shew'd me several Cabbins built up, some in the great Cabbin, and some partition'd off, out of the Steerage, but opening into the great Cabbin, on purpose for Passengers, and gave me Leave to choose where I would; I chose a Cabbin in the Steerage, in which were very good Conveniencies to set our Chest, and Boxes, and a Table to eat on. me, and of my Husband, that he had Orders to tell me, we should eat with him, if we thought fit, during the whole Voyage on the common Terms of Passengers; that we might lay in some fresh Provisions if we pleas'd; or if not, he should lay in his usual Store, and that we should have Share with him: This was very reviving News to me, after so many Hardships, and Afflictions; I thank'd him, and told him, the Captain should make his own Terms with us, and ask'd him Leave to go and tell my Husband of it, who was not very well, and was not yet out of his Cabbin: Accordingly I went, and my Husband whose Spirits were still so much sunk with the Indignity (as he understood it) offer'd him, that he was scarce yet himself, was so reviv'd with the Account I gave him of the Reception we were like to have in the Ship, that he was quite another Man, and new Vigour and Courage appear'd in his very Countenance; so true is it, that the greatest Spirits, when overwhelm'd by their Afflictions, are subject to the greatest Dejections. and gave the Mate Thanks for the Kindness which he had express'd to us, and sent suitable Acknowledgments by him to the Captain, offering to Pay him by Advance, whatever he demanded for our Passage, and for the Conveniencies he had help'd us to; the Mate told him that the Captain would be on Board in the Aft ernoon, and that he would leave all that to him; accordingly in the Afternoon, the Captain came, and we found him the same courteous obliging Man, that the Boatswain had represented him; and he was so well pleas'd with my Husband's Conversation, that in short, he would not let us keep the Cabbin we had chosen, but gave us one, that as I said before, open'd into the great Cabbin. a Prey of us, but for fifteen Guineas we had our whole Passage and Provisions, eat at the Captain's Table, and were very handsomely Entertain'd. his round House, as they call it, to a rich Planter, who went over with his Wife, and three Children, who eat by themselves; he had some other ordinary Passengers, who Quarter'd in the Steerage; and as for our old Fraternity, they were kept under the Hatches, and came very little on the Deck. was but just that she, who was really concern'd for me, should have part in my good Fortune; besides I wanted her Assistance to supply me with several Necessaries, which before I was shy of letting any Body see me have; but now I had a Cabbin and room to set things in, I order'd abundance of good things for our Comfort in the Voyage, as Brandy, Sugar, Lemons, & c. to make Punch, and Treat our Benefactor, the Captain; and abundance of things for eating and drinking; also a larger Bed, and Bedding proportion'd to it; so that in a Word, we resolv'd to want for nothing. come to the Place, and begin to call ourselves Planters; and I was far from being ignorant of what was needful on that Occasion; particularly all sorts of Tools for the Planters-Work, and for building; and all kinds of House- Furniture, which if to be bought in the Country, must necessarily cost double the Price. the Captain, and told him, that she hop'd ways might be found out, for her two unfortunate Cousins, as she call'd us, to obtain our Freedom when we came into the Country, and so enter'd into a Discourse with him about the Means and Terms also, of which I shall say more in its Place; and after thus sounding the Captain, she let him know, tho' we were unhappy in the Circumstance that occasion'd our going, yet that we were not unfurnish'd to set ourselves to Work in the Country; and were resolv'd to settle, and live there as Planters: The Captain readily offer'd his Assistance, told her the Method of entering upon such Business, and how easy, nay, how certain it was for industrious People to recover their Fortunes in such a manner: Madam, says he, 'tis no Reproach to any Man in that Country to have been sent over in worse Circumstances than I perceive your Cousins are in, provided they do but apply with good Judgment to the Business of the Place when they come there. with us, and he like a knowing Man, told her thus: Madam, your Cousins first must procure some Body to buy them as Servants, in Conformity to the Conditions of their Transportation, and then in the Name of that Person, they may go about what they will; they may either Purchase some Plantations already begun, or they may purchase Land of the Government of the Country, and begin where they please, and both will be done reasonably; she bespoke his Favour in the first Article, which he promis'd to her to take upon himself, and indeed faithful perform'd it; and as to the rest, he promis'd to recommend us to such as should give us the best Advice, and not to impose upon us, which was as much as could be desir'd. Stock of Tools and Materials for the Business of Planting, and he said, yes, by all means; then she begg'd his Assistance in that, and told him she would furnish us with every thing that was Convenient whatever it cost her; he accordingly gave her a List of things Necessary for a Planter, which by his Account came to about fourscore, or an Hundred Pounds; and in short, she went about as dexterously to buy them, as if she had been an old Virginia Merchant; only that she bought by my Direction above twice as much of every Thing, as he had given her a List of. them, and endors'd those Bills of Loading to my Husband, Ensuring the Cargo afterwards in her own Name; so that we were provided for all Events, and for all Disasters. l. which as I have said, he had about him in Gold, to lay out thus, and I gave her a good Sum besides; so that I did not break into the Stock, which I had left in her Hands at all, but after all we had near 200 l. in Money, which was more than enough for our purpose. accommodated, we set Sail from Bugby's Hole to Gravesend, where the Ship lay about ten Days more, and where the Captain came on Board for good and all. Here the Captain offer'd us a civility, which indeed we had no Reason to expect, Namely, to let us go on Shore, and refresh our selves, upon giving our Words, that we would not go from him, and that we would return peaceably on Board again: This was such an Evidence of his Confidence in us, that it over come my Husband, who in a meer Principle of Gratitude, told him as he could not be in any Capacity to make a suitable Return for such a Favour, so he could not think of accepting it, nor could he be easy that the Captain shou'd run such a Risque: After some mutual Civilities, I gave my Husband a Purse, in which was 80 Guineas, and he put it into the Captain's Hand: There Captain, says he, there's part of a Pledge for our Fidelity, if we deal dishonestly with you on any Account, 'tis your own; and on this we went on Shore. having made such Provision to Settle there, it did not seem Rational that we would chuse to remain here at the Peril of Life, for such it must have been: In a Word, we went all on Shore with the Captain, and Supp'd together in Gravesend, where we were very Merry, staid all Night, lay at the House where we Supp'd, and came all very honestly on Board again with him in the Morning. Here we bought ten Dozen of Bottles of good Beer, some Wine, some Fowls, and such Things as we thought might be acceptable on Board. Downs, as did also the Captain's Wife, with whom she went back; I was never so sorrowful at parting with my own Mother as I was at parting with her, and I never saw her more: We had a fair Easterly Wind the third Day after we came to the Downs, and we sail'd from thence the 10th of April; nor did we touch any more at any Place, till being driven on the Coast of Ireland by a very hard Gale of Wind, the Ship came to an Anchor in a little Bay, near a River, whose Name I remember not, but they said the River came down from Limerick, and that it was the largest River in Ireland. continu'd the same kind good humour'd Man as at first, took us two on Shore with him again: He did it now in kindness to my Husband indeed, who bore the Sea very ill, especially when it blew so hard: Here we bought again, store of fresh Provisions, Beef, Pork, Mutton and Fowls, and the Captain stay'd to Pickle up five or six Barrels of Beef to lengthen out the Ships Store: We were here not above five Days, when the Weather turning mild, and a fair Wind; we set Sail again, and in two and Forty Days came safe to the Coast of Virginia. that he found by my Discourse, I had some Relations in the Place, and that I had been there before, and so he suppos'd I understood the Custom, in their disposing the convict Prisoners when they arriv'd; I told him I did not, and that as to what Relations I had in the Place, he might be sure I would make myself known to none of them while in the Circumstances of a Prisoner, and that as to the rest, we left ourselves entirely to him to assist us, as he was pleas'd to promise us he wou'd do.  He told me I must get some Body in the Place to come and buy me as a Servant, and who must answer for me to the Governor of the Country, if he demanded me; I told him we should do as he should direct; so he brought a Planter to treat with him, as it were for the Purchase of me for a Servant, my Husband not being order'd to be Sold, and there I was formally sold to him, and went a Shore with him: The Captain went with us, and carried us to a certain House whether it was to be call'd a Tavern or not, I know not but we had a Bowl of Punch there made of Rum, & c. and were very Merry.  After some time the Planter gave us a Certificate of Discharge, and an Acknowledgement of having serv'd him faithfully, and I was free from him the next Morning, to go whether I would. Tobacco, which he said he was Accountable for to his Freighter, and we bought for him, and made him a present of 20 Guineas, besides; which he was abundantly satisfy'd with. Colony of Virginia we Settled in, for divers Reasons; it may suffice to mention that we went into the great River of Potomack, the Ship being bound thither; and there we intended to have Settled at first, tho' afterwards we altered our Minds. Shore, and plac'd them in a Store house, which with a Lodging we hir'd at the small Place or Village, where we Landed; I say the first thing was to enquire after my Mother, and after my Brother, (that fatal Person who I married as a Husband, as I have related at large;) a little enquiry furnish'd me with Information that Mrs. ---, that is my Mother was Dead; that my Brother or (Husband) was alive, and which was worse, I found he was remov'd from the Plantation where I liv'd, and liv'd with one of his Sons in a Plantation just by the Place were we Landed, and had hir'd a Warehouse. that he could not know me, I was not only perfectly easy, but had a great mind to see him if it was possible, without his seeing me; in order to that I found out by enquiry the Plantation where he liv'd, and with a Woman of the Place, who I got to help me, like what we call a Chairwoman, I rambl'd about towards the Place, as if I had only a mind to see the Country, and look about me; at last I came so near that I saw the Dwelling-house: I ask'd the Woman whose Plantation that was, she said, it belong'd to such a Man, and looking out a little to our right Hands, there says she, is the Gentleman that owns the Plantation, and his Father with him: What are their Christian Names? said I, I know not said she, what the old Gentleman's Name is, but his Sons Name is Humphry, and I believe, says she, the Fathers is so too; you may guess, if you can, what a confus'd mixture of Joy and Fright possest my Thoughts upon this Occasion, for I immediately knew that this was no Body else, but my own Son, by that Father she shewed me, who was my own Brother: I had no Mask, but I ruffled my Hoods so about my Face, that I depended upon it, that after above 20 Years absence, and withal not expecting any thing of me in that part of the World, he would not be able to know me; but I need not have us'd all that Caution, for he was grown dim Sighted, by some Distemper, which had fallen upon his Eyes, and could but just see well enough to walk about, and not run against a Tree, or into a Ditch: As they drew near to us, I said, does he know you Mrs. Owen? so they call'd the Woman, yes, she said, if he hears me speak, he will know me; but he can't see well enough to know me, or any Body else; and so she told me Story of his Sight, as I have related: This made me secure, and so I threw open my Hoods again, and let them pass by me: It was a wretch'd thing for a Mother thus to see her own Son, a handsome comely young Gentleman in flourishing Circumstances, and durst not make herself known to him; and durst not take any notice of him; let any Mother of Children that reads this, consider it, and but think with what anguish of Mind I restrain'd myself; what yearnings of Soul I had in me to embrace him, and weep over him; and how I thought all my Entrails turn'd within me, that my very Bowels mov'd, and I knew not what to do; as I now know not how to express those Agonies: When he went from me I stood gazing and trembling, and looking after him as long as I could see him; then sitting down on the Grass, just at a Place I had mark'd, I made as if I lay down to rest me, but turn'd from her, and lying on my Face wept, and kiss'd the Ground that he had set his Foot on. perceiv'd it, and thought I was not well, which I was oblig'd to pretend was true; upon which she press'd me to rise, the Ground being damp and dangerous, which I did, and walk'd away. Son, a new Occasion of melancholy offer'd itself thus: The Woman began, as if she would tell me a Story to divert me; there goes, says she, a very odd Tale among the Neighbours where this Gentleman formerly liv'd: What was that, said I? why, says she, that old Gentleman going to England, when he was a young Man, fell in Love with a young Lady there, one of the finest Women that ever was seen here, and Married her, and brought her over hither to his Mother, who was then living: He liv'd here several Years with her, continu'd she, and had several Children by her, of which the young Gentleman that was with him now, was one; but after some time, the old Gentlewoman his Mother talking to her, of something relating to herself, and of her Circumstances in England, which were bad enough; the Daughter in Law, began to be very much surpriz'd, and uneasy, and in short, in examining further into things it appear'd past all Contradiction, that she (the old Gentlewoman) was her own Mother, and that consequently, that Son was her own Brother, which struck the Family with Horror, and put them into such Confusion, that it had almost ruin'd them all; the young Woman would not live with him, he for a time went Distracted, and at last the young Woman went away for England, and has never been heard of since. 'tis impossible to describe the Nature of my disturbance: I seem'd astonish'd at the Story, and ask'd her a Thousand Questions about the particulars, which I found she was thoroughly acquainted with; at last I began to enquire into the Circumstances of the Family, how the old Gentlewoman, I mean, my Mother died, and how she left what she had; for my Mother had promis'd me very solemnly, that when she died, she would do something for me, and leave it so, as that, if I was Living, I should one way or other come at it, without its being in the Power of her Son, my Brother and Husband to prevent it: She told me she did not know exactly how it was order'd; but she had been told, that my Mother had left a Sum of Money, and had tyed her Plantation for the Payment of it, to be made good to the Daughter, if ever she could be heard of, either in England, or elsewhere; and that the Trust was left with this Son, who we saw with his Father. my Heart with a Thousand Thoughts, what Course I should take, and in what manner I should make myself known, or whether I should ever make myself known, or no. neither knew I what Course to take: It lay heavy upon my mind Night, and Day, I could neither Sleep or Converse, so that my Husband perceiv'd it, wonder'd what ail'd me and strove to divert me, but it was all to no purpose; he press'd me to tell him what it was troubled me, but I put it off, till at last importuning me continually, I was forc'd to form a Story, which yet had a plain Truth to lay it upon too; I told him I was troubled because I found we must shift our Quarters, and alter our Scheme of Settling, for that I found I should be known, if I stay'd in that part of the Country; for that my Mother being dead, several of my Relations were come into that Part where we then was, and that I must either discover myself to them, which in our present Circumstances was not proper on many Accounts, or remove, and which to do I knew not, and that this it was that made me melancholly. myself known to any Body in the Circumstances, in which we then were; and therefore he told me he would be willing to remove to any other part of the Country, or even to any other Country if I thought fit; but now I had another Difficulty, which was, that if I remov'd to another Colony, I put myself out of the way of ever making a due Search after those Things which my Mother had left: Again, I could never so much as think of breaking the Secret of my former Marriage to my new Husband; it was not a Story, would bear telling, nor could I tell what might be the Consequences of it; it was impossible too, without making it publick all over the Country, as well who I was, as what I now was also. for he thought I was not open with him, and did not let him into every Part of my Grievance; and he would often say, he wonder'd what he had done, that I would not trust him, whatever it was, especially if it was grievous and afflicting; the Truth is, he ought to have been trusted with every Thing; for no Man could deserve better of a Wife; but this was a thing I knew not how to open to him, and yet having no Body to disclose any Part of it to, the Burthen was too heavy for my Mind; for let them say what they please of our Sex not being able to keep a Secret; my Life is a plain Conviction to me of the Contrary; but be it our Sex, or the Men's Sex, a Secret of Moment should always have a Confident, a bosom Friend, to whom we may communicate the Joy of it, or the Grief of it, be it which it will, or it will be a double Weight upon the Spirits, and perhaps become even insupportable in it self; and this I appeal to Human Testimony for the Truth of. greatest, and best Qualities other ways, yet have found themselves weak in this Part, and have not been able to bear the Weight of a secret Joy, or of a secret Sorrow; but have been oblig'd to disclose it, even for the mere giving Vent to themselves, and to unbend the Mind, opprest with the Weights which attended it; nor was this any Token of Folly at all but a natural Consequence of the Thing; and such People had they struggl'd longer with the Oppression, would certainly have told it in their Sleep, and disclos'd the Secret, let it have been of what fatal Nature soever, without regard to the Person to whom it might be expos'd.  This Necessity of Nature, is a Thing which Works sometimes with such Vehemency, in the Minds of those who are guilty of any atrocious Villany; such as a secret Murther in particular, that they have been oblig'd to Discover it, tho' the Consequence has been their own Destruction: Now, tho' it may be true that the divine Justice ought to have the Glory of all those Discoveries and Confessions, yet 'tis as certain that Providence which ordinarily Works by the Hands of Nature, makes Use here, of the same natural Causes to produce those extraordinry Effects. with Crime, and with Criminals; I knew one Fellow, that while I was a Prisoner in Newgate, was one of those they called then Night-fliers, I know not what Word they may have understood it by since; but he was one, who by Connivance was admitted to go Abroad every Evening, when he play'd his Pranks, and furnish'd those honest People they call Thief-Catchers with Business to find out the next Day, and restore for a Reward, what they had stolen the Evening before: This Fellow was as sure to tell in his Sleep all that he had done, and every Step he had taken, what he had stolen, and where, as sure, as if he had engag'd to tell it waking, and therefore he was oblig'd after he had been out to lock himself up, or be locked up by some of the Keepers that had him in Fee, that no Body should hear him; but on the other Hand, if he had told all the Particulars, and given a full Account of his Rambles and Success to any Comrade, any Brother Thief, or to his Employers, as I may justly call them, then all was well, and he slept as quietly as other People. Moral of every Part of it, and for Instruction, Caution, Warning and Improvement to every Reader, so this will not pass I hope for an unnecessary Digression, concerning some People, being oblig'd to disclose the greatest Secrets either of their own, or other Peoples Affairs. Naming; and the only Relief I found for it, was to let my Husband into so much of it, as I thought would convince him of the Necessity there was, for us to think of Settling in some other Part of the World, and the next Consideration before us, was, which Part of the English Settlements we should go to? my Husband was a perfect Stranger to the Country, and had not yet so much as a Geographical Knowledge of the Situation of the several Places; and I, that till I wrote this, did not know what the Word Geographical signify'd, had only a general Knowledge from long Conversation with People that came from, or went to several Places; but this I knew, that Maryland, Pensilvania, East and West Jersy, New York, and New England, lay all North of Virginia, and that they were consequently all colder Climates, to which, for that very Reason, I had an Aversion; for that as I naturally lov'd warm Weather, so now I grew into Years; I had a stronger Inclination to shun a cold Climate; I therefore consider'd of going to Carolina, which is the most Southern Colony of the English on the Continent; and hither I propos'd to go, the rather, because I might with ease come from thence at any time, when it might be proper to enquire after my Mother's Effects, and to demand them. we was, and carrying our Effects with us to Carolina, where we resolv'd to Settle; for my Husband readily agreed to the first Part ( viz. ) that it was not at all proper to stay where we was, since I had assur'd him we should be known there, and the rest I conceal'd from him. my Mind still, and I could not think of going out of the Country, without some how or other making Enquiry into the grand Affair of what my Mother had done for me; nor could I with any Patience bear the Thought of going away, and not make my self known to my old Husband; ( Brother ) or to my Child, his Son; only I would fain have had it done without my new Husband having any Knowledge of it, or they having any Knowledge of him. would gladly have sent my Husband away to Carolina, and have come after my self; but this was impracticable, he would not stir without me, being himself unacquainted with the Country, and with the Methods of settling any where: Then I thought we would both go first, and that when we were settled I should come back to Virginia, but even then I knew he would never part with me, and be left there alone, the Case was plain, he was bred a Gentleman, and was not only unacquainted, but indolent, and when we did Settle, would much rather go into the Woods with his Gun, which they call there Hunting, and which is the ordinary Work of the Indians: I say, he would much rather do that, than attend the natural Business of the Plantation. what to do in, I had such strong Impressions on my Mind about discovering my self to my old Husband, that I could not withstand them; and the rather, because it run in my Thoughts, that if I did not, while he liv'd, I might in vain endeavour to convince my Son afterward, that I was really the same Person, and that I was his Mother, and so might both lose the Assistance and Comfort of the Relation, and lose whatever it was my Mother had left me; and yet on the other Hand, I could never think it proper to discover the Circumstances I was in; as well relating to the having a Husband with me, as to my being brought over as a Criminal; on both which Accounts it was absolutely Necessary to me to remove from the Place where I was, and come again to him, as from another Place and in another Figure. necessity there was of our not Settling in Potomack River, that we should presently be made Publick there, whereas if we went to any other Place in the World, we could come in with as much Reputation, as any Family that came to Plant: That as it was always agreeable to the Inhabitants to have Families come among them to Plant, who brought Substance with them, so we should be sure of agreeable Reception, and without any possibility of a Discovery of our Circumstances. and that I durst not now let my self be known to them, because they would soon come to know the Occasion of my coming over, which would be to expose myself to the last Degree; so I had Reason to believe that my Mother who died here had left me something, and perhaps considerable, which it might be very well worth my while to enquire after; but that this too could not be done without exposing us publickly, unless we went from hence; and then, where ever we settled, I might come as it were to visit and to see my Brother and Nephews, make my self known, enquire after what was my Due, be receiv'd with Respect, and at the same time have Justice done me, whereas if I did it now, I could expect nothing but with Trouble, such as exacting it by Force, receiving it with Curses and Reluctance, and with all kinds of Affronts; which he would not perhaps bear to see: That in Case of being oblig'd to legal Proofs of being really her Daughter, I might be at a Loss, be oblig'd to have Recourse to England, and it may be to fail at last, and so lose it: With these Arguments, and having thus acquainted my Husband with the whole Secret so far as was needful to him, we resolv'd to go and seek a Settlement in some other Colony, and at first Carolina was the Place pitch'd upon. and in a very little while got information, that on the other side the Bay as they call it, namely, in Maryland there was a Ship, which came from Carolina, loaden with Rice, and other Goods, and was going back again thither: On this News we hir'd a Sloop to take in our Goods, and taking as it were a final farewel of Potowmack River, we went with all our Cargo over to Maryland. him than all the Voyage from England, because the Weather was bad, the Water rough, and the Vessel small and inconvenient, in the next Place we were full a-hundred Miles up Potowmack River, in a part they call Westmoreland County, and as that River is by far the greatest in Virginia, and I have heard say, it is the greatest River in the World that falls into another River, and not directly into the Sea; so we had base Weather in it, and were frequently in great Danger; for tho' they call it but a River, 'tis frequently so broad, that when we were in the middle, we could not see Land on either Side for many Leagues together: Then we had the great Bay of Chesapeake to cross, which is where the River Potowmack falls into it, near thirty Miles broad, so that our Voyage was full two hundred Mile, in a poor sorry Sloop, with all our Treasure, and if any Accident had happen'd to us, we might at last have been very miserable; supposing we had lost our Goods and saved our Lives only, and had then been left naked and destitute, and in a wild strange Place, not having one Friend or Acquaintance in all that part of the World? The very thoughts of it gives me some horror, even since the Danger is past. Philip's Point, and behold when we came thither, the Ship bound to Carolina, was loaded and gone away but three Days before.  This was a Disappointment, but however, I that was to be discourag'd with nothing, told my Husband, that since we could not get Passage to Carolina, and that the Country we was in, was very fertile and good; we would see if we could find out any thing for our Turn where we was, and that if he lik'd things we would Settle here. Place, either for our being on Shore, or preserving our Goods on Shore, but was directed by a very honest Quaker, who we found there to go to a Place, about sixty Miles East; that is to say, nearer the Mouth of the Bay, where he said he liv'd and where we should be Accommodated, either to Plant, or to wait for any other Place to Plant in, that might be more Covenient, and he invited us with so much kindness that we agreed to go, and the Quaker himself went with us. come on Shore from a Ship of Leverpool, and a Negro Man-Servant, things absolutely necessary for all People that pretended to Settle in that Country: This honest Quaker was very helpful to us, and when we came to the Place that he propos'd, found us out a convenient Storehouse, for our Goods, and Lodging for ourselves, and Servants; and about two Months, or thereabout afterwards; by his Direction we took up a large peice of Land from the Government of that Country, in order to form our Plantation, and so we laid the thoughts of going to Carolina wholly aside, having been very well receiv'd here, and Accommodated with a convenient Lodging, till we could prepare things, and have Land enough cur'd, and Materials provided for building us a House, all which we manag'd by the Direction of the Quaker; so that in one Years time, we had near fifty Acres of Land clear'd, part of it enclos'd, and some of it Planted with Tobacco, tho' not much, besides, we had Garden ground, and Corn sufficient to supply our Servants with Roots, and Herbs, and Bread. enquire after my Friends; he was the willinger to consent to it now, because he had business upon his Hands sufficient to employ him, besides his Gun to divert him, which they call Hunting there, and which he greatly delighted in; and indeed we us'd to look at one another, sometimes with a great deal of Pleasure, reflecting how much better that was, not than Newgate only, but than the most prosperous of our Circumstances in the wicked Trade we had been both carrying on. of the Colony, as much Land for 35 Pound, paid in ready Money, as would make a sufficient Plantation to us as long as we could either of us live; and as for Children I was past any thing of that kind. Bay, to the Place, where my Brother, once a Husband liv'd; but I did not go to the same Village, where I was before, but went up another great River, on the East side of the River Potowmack, call'd Rapahannock River, and by this means came on the back of his Plantation, which was large, and by the help of a Navigable Creek, that run into the Rapahannock, I came very near it. and to tell him who I was; but not knowing what Temper I might find him in, or how much out of Temper rather, I might make him by such a rash visit.  I resolv'd to write a Letter to him first to let him know who I was, and that I was come not to give him any trouble upon the old Relation, which I hop'd was entirely forgot; but that I apply'd to him as a Sister to a Brother, desiring his Assistance in the Case of that Provision, which our Mother at her decease had left for my Support, and which I did not doubt but he would do me Justice in, especially considering that I was come thus far to look after it. told him he knew to be my own Child, and that as I was guilty of nothing in Marrying him any more than he was in Marrying me, neither of us having then known our being at all related to one another; so I hop'd he would allow me the most Passionate desire of once seeing my own, and only Child, and of showing something of the Infirmities of a Mother in preserving a violent Affection for him, who had never been able to retain any thought of me one way or other. it to his Son to Read; his Eyes being I knew so dim, that he cou'd not see to read it; but it fell out better than so, for as his Sight was dim, so he had allow'd his Son to open all Letters that came to his Hand for him, and the old Gentleman being from Home, or out of the way when my Messenger came, my Letter came directly to my Son's Hand, and he open'd and read it. the Person was who gave him that Letter? the Messenger told him the Place, which was about seven Miles off, so he bid him stay, and ordering a Horse to be got ready, and two Servants, away he came to me with the Messenger: Let any one judge the Consternation I was in, when my Messenger came back and told me the old Gentleman was not at Home, but his Son was come along with him, and was just coming up to me: I was perfectly confounded, for I knew not whether it was Peace or War, nor cou'd I tell how to behave: However, I had but a very few Moments to think, for my Son was at the Heels of the Messenger, and coming up into my Lodgings, ask'd the Fellow at the Door, something, I suppose it was, for I did not hear it, which was the Gentlewoman that sent him? for the Messenger said, there she is Sir, at which he comes directly up to me, kisses me, took me in his Arms, embrac'd me with so much Passion, that he could not speak, but I could feel his Breast heave and throb like a Child that Cries, but Sobs, and cannot cry it out. I found, for it was easy to discover that Part, that he came not as a Stranger, but as a Son to a Mother, and indeed a Son, who had never before known what a Mother of his own was; in short, we cryed over one another a considerable while, when at last he broke out first, My Dear Mother, says he, are you still alive! I never expected to have seen your Face; as for me, I cou'd say nothing a great while. told me how things stood, he told me he had not shewed my Letter to his Father, or told him any thing about it; that what his Grand-mother left me, was in his Hands, and that he would do me Justice to my full Satisfaction; that as to his Father, he was old and infirm both in Body and Mind; that he was very Fretful, and Passionate, almost Blind, and capable of nothing; and he question'd whether he would know how to act in an Affair, which was of so nice a Nature as this; and that therefore he had come himself, as well to satisfy himself in seeing me, which he could not restrain himself from, as also to put it into my Power, to make a Judgement after I had seen how things were, whether I would discover myself to his Father, or no. a Man of Sense, and needed no Direction from me; I told him, I did not wonder that his Father was as he had describ'd him, for that his Head was a little touch'd before I went away; and principally his Disturbance was, because I could not be perswaded to live with him as my Husband, after I knew that he was my Brother: That as he knew better than I, what his Fathers present Condition was, I should readily joyn with him in such Measures as he would direct: That I was indifferent, as to seeing his Father, since I had seen him first, and he cou'd not have told me better News, than to tell me that what his Grand-mother had left me, was entrusted in his Hands, who I doubted not now he knew who I was, would as he said, do me Justice: I enquir'd then how long my Mother had been dead, and where she died, and told so many particulars of the Family, that I left him no room to doubt the Truth of my being really and truly his Mother. him I was on the Maryland side of the Bay, at the Plantation of a particular Friend, who came from England in the same Ship with me, that as for that side of the Bay where he was, I had no Habitation; he told me I should go Home with him, and live with him, if I pleas'd, as long as I liv'd: That as to his Father he knew no Body, and would never so much as guess at me; I consider'd of that a little, and told him, that tho' it was really no little concern to me to live at a distance from him; yet I could not say it would be the most comfortable thing in the World to me to live in the House with him; and to have that unhappy Object always before me, which had been such a blow to my Peace before; that tho' I should be glad to have his Company (my Son) or to be as near him as possible, yet I could not think of being in the House where I should be also under constant Restraint, for fear of betraying myself in my Discourse, nor should I be able to refrain some Expressions in my Conversing with him as my Son, that might discover the whole Affair, which would by no means be Convenient. says he, you shall be as near me as you can; so he took me with him on Horseback to a Plantation, next to his own, and where I was as well entertain'd as I cou'd have been in his own; having left me there, he went away home, telling me he would talk of the main Business the next Day, and having first called me his Aunt, and given a Charge to the People, who it seems were his Tenants, to treat me with all possible Respect; about two Hours after he was gone, he sent me a Maid-Servant, and a Negro Boy to wait on me, and Provisions ready dress'd for my Supper; and thus I was as if I had been in a new World, and began almost to wish that I had not brought my Lancashire Husband from England at all. Husband entirely, as I had ever done from the beginning; and he merited it as much as it was possible for a Man to do, but that by the way. after a little Discourse, he first of all pull'd out a Deer skin Bag, and gave it me, with five and fifty Spanish Pistoles in it, and told me that was to supply my Expences from England, for tho' it was not his Business to enquire, yet he ought to think I did not bring a great deal of Money out with me, it not being usual to bring much Money into that Country: Then he pull'd out his Grandmother's Will, and read it over to me, whereby it appear'd, that she left a Plantation, on York River, to me, with the Stock of Servants and Cattle upon it, and had given it in Trust to this Son of mine for my Use, when ever he should hear of me, and to my Heirs, if I had any Children, and in default of Heirs, to whomsoever I should by Will dispose of it; but gave the Income of it, till I should be heard of, to my said Son; and if I should not be living, then it was to him, and his Heirs. manag'd it by a head Clerk, as he did another that was his Fathers, that lay hard by it, and went over himself three or four times a Year to look after it; I ask'd him what he thought the Plantation might be worth, he said, if I would let it out, he would give me about sixty Pounds a Year for it; but if I would live on it, then it would be worth much more, and he believ'd would bring me in about 150 l. a Year; but seeing I was likely either to Settle on the other side the Bay, or might perhaps have a mind to go back to England, if I would let him be my Steward he would manage it for me, as he had done for himself, and that he believ'd he should be able to send me as much Tobacco from it, as would yield me about 100 l. a Year, sometimes more. really my Heart began to look up more seriously, than I think it ever did before, and to look with great Thankfulness to the Hand of Providence, which had done such Wonders for me, who had been my self the greatest Wonder of Wickedness, perhaps that had been suffered to live in the World; and I must again observe, that not on this Occasion only, but even on all other Occasions of Thankfulness, my past Wickedness and abominable Life never look'd so Monstruous to me, and I never so compleatly abhorr'd it, and reproach'd my self with it, as when I had a Sense upon me of Providence doing good to me, while I had been making those vile Returns on my Part. see Cause, and I go on to the Fact; my Sons tender Carriage, and kind Offers fetch'd Tears from me, almost all the while he talk'd with me; indeed I could scarce Discourse with him, but in the Intervals of my Passion; however, at length I began, and expressing my self with wonder at my being so happy to have the Trust of what I had left, put into the Hands of my own Child; I told him, that as to the Inheritance of it, I had no Child but him in the World, and was now past having any if I should Marry, and therefore would desire him to get a Writing drawn, which I was ready to execute, by which I would after me give it wholly to him, and to his Heirs; and in the mean Time smiling, I ask'd him, what made him continue a Batchelor so long; his Answer was kind, and ready, that Virginia did not yield any great Plenty of Wives, and that since I talk'd of going back to England, I should send him a Wife from London. that ever past over my Head in my Life, and which gave me the truest Satisfaction: He came every Day after this, and spent great part of his time with me, and carried me about to several of his Friends Houses, where I was entertain'd with great Respect; also I dined several Times at his own House, when he took Care always to see his half dead Father so out of the Way, that I never saw him, or he me: I made him one Present, and it was all I had of Value, and that was one of the Gold Watches, of which, I said I had two in my Chest, and this I happen'd to have with me, and gave it him at his third Visit: I told him, I had nothing of any Value to bestow but that, and I desir'd he would now and then kiss it for my sake; I did not indeed tell him that I stole it from a Gentlewoman's Side, at a Meeting House in London, that's by the way. no; but I press'd it on him, and made him accept it, and it was not much less worth than his Leather Pouch full of Spanish Gold; no, tho' it were to be reckon'd, as if at London, whereas it was worth twice as much there; at length he took it, kiss'd it, told me the Watch should be a Debt upon him, that he would be paying, as long as I liv'd. him, and I sign'd them very freely, and deliver'd them to him with a hundred Kisses; for sure nothing ever pass'd between a Mother, and a tender Dutiful Child, with more Affection: The next Day he brings me an Obligation under his Hand and Seal, whereby he engag'd himself to Manage the Plantation for my Account, and to remit the Produce to my Order where-ever I should be, and withal, oblig'd himself to make up the Produce a hundred Pound a Year to me: When he had done so, he told me, that as I came to demand before the Crop was off, I had a Right to the Produce of the current Year, and so he paid me a hundred Pound in Spanish Pieces of Eight, and desir'd me to give him a Receipt for it as in Full for that Year, ending at Christmas following; this being about the latter End of August. Nay, he would have come over the Bay with me, but I would by no means allow it; however he would send me over in a Sloop of his own, which was built like a Yatch, and serv'd him as well for Pleasure as Business: This I accepted of, and so after the utmost Expressions both of Duty, and Affection, he let me come away, and I arriv'd safe in two Days at my Friends the Quakers. Harness, and Saddles; some Hogs, two Cows, and a thousand other Things, the Gift of the Kindest and tenderest Child that ever Woman had: I related to my Husband all the Particulars of this Voyage, except that I call'd my Son (my Cousin;) and first I told him, that I had lost my Watch, which he seem'd to take as a Misfortune; but then I told him how kind my Cousin had been, that my Mother had left me such a Plantation, and that he had preserv'd it for me, in Hopes some time or other he should hear from me; then I told him that I had left it to his Management, that he would render me a faithful Account of its Produce; and then I pull'd him out the hundred Pound in Silver, as the first Years Produce, and then pulling out the Deer Skin Purse, with the Pistoles, and here my Dear, says I, is the Gold Watch: Says my Husband, so is Heavens Goodness sure to Work the same Effects, in all sensible Minds, where Mercies touch the Heart; lifted up both his Hands, and with an Extasy of Joy, What is God a doing! says he, for such an ungrateful Dog as I am? Then I let him know, what I had brought over in the Sloop, besides all this; I mean the Horses, Hogs, and Cows, and other Stores for our Plantation; all which added to his Surprize, and fill'd his Heart with thankfulness; and from this time forward I believe he was as sincere a Penetent, and as thoroughly a reform'd Man, as ever God's Goodness brought back from a Profligate, a Highway-Man, and a Robber. I could fill a larger History than this, with the Evidences of this Truth, and but that I doubt that Part of the Story will not be equally diverting, as the wicked Part. own Part; we went on with our own Plantation, and manag'd it with the Help and Direction of such Friends as we got there, and especially the honest Quaker, who prov'd a faithful, generous, and steady Friend to us; and we had very good Success; for having a flourishing Stock to begin with, as I have said; and this being now encreas'd, by the Addition of a hundred and fifty Pound Sterling in Money, we enlarg'd our Number of Servants, built us a very good House, and cur'd every Year a great deal of Land.  The second Year I wrote to my old Governess, giving her part with us of the Joy of our Success, and order'd her how to lay out the Money I had left with her, which was 250 l. as above, and to send it to us in Goods, which she perform'd, with her usual Kindness and Fidelity, and all this arriv'd safe to us. for my self; and I took especial Care to buy for him all those Things that I knew he delighted to have; as two good long Wigs, two Silver Hilted Swords, three or four fine Fowling Pieces, a fine Saddle with Holsters and Pistoles very handsome, with a Scarlet Cloak; and in a Word, every thing I could think of to oblige him; and to make him appear, as he really was, a very fine Gentleman: I order'd a good Quantity of such Houshold-Stuff, as we wanted, with Linnen for us both; as for my self, I wanted very little of Cloths, or Linnen, being very well furnish'd before: The rest of my Cargo consisted in Iron-Work, of all Sorts, Harness for Horses, Tools, Cloaths for Servants, and Woollen-Cloth, Stuffs, Serges, Stockings, Shoes, Hats, and the like, such as Servants wear; and whole Pieces also, to make up for Servants, all by Direction of the Quaker; and all this Cargo arrived safe, and in good Condition, with three Women Servants, lusty Wenches, which my old Governess had pick'd up for me, suitable enough to the Place, and to the Work we had for them to do, one of which happen'd to come Double, having been got with Child by one of the Seamen in the Ship, as she own'd afterwards, before the Ship got so far as Gravesend; so she brought us a stout Boy, about seven Months after her Landing. Cargo from England, and talking with me one Day, after he saw the Particulars; my Dear, says he, what is the Meaning of all this? I fear you will run us too deep in Debt: When shall we be able to make Returns for it all? I smil'd, and told him that it was all paid for, and then I told him, that not knowing what might befal us in the Voyage, and considering what our Circumstances might expose us to; I had not taken my whole Stock with me, that I had reserv'd so much in my Friend's Hands, which now we were come over safe, and settled in a Way to Live, I had sent for as he might see. nothing, at last he began thus, Hold lets see, says he, telling upon his Fingers still; and first on his Thumb, there's 246 l. in Money at first, then two gold Watches, Diamond Rings, and Plate, says he, upon the fore Finger, then upon the next Finger, here's a Plantation on York River, a 100 l. a Year, then 150 in Money; then a Sloop load of Horses, Cows, Hogs and Stores, and so on to the Thumb again; and now, says he, a Cargo cost 250 l. in England, and worth here twice the Money, well, says I, What do you make of all that? make of it, says he, why who says I was deceiv'd, when I married a Wife in Lancashire? I think I have married a Fortune, and a very good Fortune too, says he. encreasing; for our new Plantation grew upon our Hands insensibly; and in eight Year which we lived upon it, we brought it to such a pitch, that the Produce was, at least, 300 l. Sterling a Year; I mean, worth so much in England. and to receive another Years Income of my Plantation; and I was surpriz'd to hear, just at my Landing there, that my old Husband was dead, and had not been bury'd above a Fortnight. This, I confess, was not disagreeable News, because now I could appear as I was in a marry'd Condition; so I told my Son before I came from him, that I believ'd I should marry a Gentleman who had a Plantation near mine; and tho' I was legally free to marry, as to any Obligation that was on me before, yet that I was shye of it, least the Blot should some time or other be reviv'd, and it might make a Husband uneasy; my Son the same kind dutiful and obliging Creature as ever, treated me now at his own House, paid me my hundred Pound; and sent me Home again loaded with Presents. over to see us, and my Husband wrote a very obliging Letter to him also, inviting him to come and see him; and he came accordingly some Months after, and happen'd to be there just when my Cargo from England came in, which I let him believe belong'd all to my Husband's Estate, and not to me. dead, I then freely gave my Husband an Account of all that Affair, and of this Cousin, as I call'd him before, being my own Son by that mistaken Match: He was perfectly easy in the Account, and told me he should have been easy if the old Man, as we call'd him, had been alive; for, said he, it was no Fault of yours, nor of his; it was a Mistake impossible to be prevented; he only reproach'd him with desiring me to conceal it, and to live with him as a Wife, after I knew that he was my Brother, that, he said, was a vile part: Thus all these little Difficulties were made easy, and we liv'd together with the greatest Kindness and Comfort imaginable; we are now grown Old, I am come back to England, being almost seventy Years of Age, my Husband sixty eight, having perform'd much more than the limitted Terms of my Transportation: And now notwithstanding all the Fatigues, and all the Miseries we have both gone thro', we are both in good Heart and Health; my Husband remain'd there sometime after me to settle our Affairs, and at first I had intended to go back to him, but at his desire I alter'd that Resolution, and he is come over to England also, where we resolve to spend the Remainder of our Years in sincere Penitence, for the wicked Lives we have lived.
