 all their Aims to those amiable Objects, the Possession of which, as they believe, is the Felicity of their Being and the End of their Creation. of Modesty; the generous Fire that animates great and enterprizing Spirits, governs their Actions, and pushes them on to worthy and heroick Undertakings, usually arises from a fine rectify'd Choler predominant in their Complexions: This enlivening Ferment temper'd and reduc'd by the Complication of different Principles, and by this means subjected to the Government of Reason, engages the Warrior in a thousand Hazards and the Statesman in anxious and endless Cares, for the Service of their Country; it is the same impulsive Spring that sets the Writer's Pen in Motion, and stirs him up to be a Benefactor to Mankind: And for want of this emboldening Principle in their Constitution, many have so great a Diffidence of themselves, and so much undervalue their laudable Talents, that they are unable, or rather unwilling to exert their Faculties, and communicate their Knowledge in publick Discourses. capable of improving the Minds of others by their printed Labours, cannot bear the Thought that ignorant and prejudic'd Assemblies, and Persons destitute of Genius and true Taste, should sit upon their Productions, and censure Performances for which they are disqualify'd. I acknowledge, that it is a great Mortification and Discouragement to an Author to foresee, that great Numbers who are entirely void of critical Abilities, will descant upon his Writings, and with a decisive Air, judge and condemn them; and to know before- hand, that many of an opposite Party will disrelish his Works, and perhaps before they have tasted them, from an Aversion to the Person of the Writer, upon the account of some disagreeable Qualities, or his different Principles. Nor will a Man be less backward to employ his Pen when he reflects, that many of his own Denomination will be equally forward to decry him, if he is not animated with the whole Spirit of the Party, and does not express a Conformity and Agreement to their entire System of Principles; for if he differs in any Article, tho of little Importance, while he continues steady in all the Fundamental and Essential Articles of their political Creed, and what is yet more surprizing, if he declares against the Immorality of any great Leader, he will be reproach'd by hot and half-witted People, as an Apostate and Deserter to the opposite side. Native Land, during his Age, but it is likewise often propagated to late Posterity; while but a single Audience at a time is instructed and mov'd by the Reason and Eloquence of a Speaker, which way of communicating Knowledge can last no longer than the transient Term of his Life; he that commits his Thoughts to Paper, not only inlightens the remotest Provinces of his own and perhaps of other Countries, but being dead he yet speaks, and while mouldring in the Grave will inform the Ages in long Succession yet to come: For as the Pen and the Press unite separate Nations, annihilate immense intervening Space, and make us converse at once with the opposite Indies, so they remove interposing Ages, and enable us to teach numberless Individuals yet unborn, and inspire with our Sentiments, and animate with our Passions, the People that hereafter shall rise into Being. themselves from their Works, while they triumph'd in the Pre-occupation of future Fame and empty Immortality. Posterity, and that they shall offend and persecute the Ages to come as they do this, by their weak; or their loose and detestable Pens: tho the Species of ill Writers, by an uninterrupted Succession, will continue as long as the Press is imploy'd, yet following Ages will suffer by Individuals of their own Production, who by great variety of deprav'd Taste and peculiar Deviations from good Sense, may affront Religion and Vertue, trample on the Rules of Modesty and good Breeding, and perhaps outrival the most arrogant Champions of Vice in the present Time, who by their prophane and immoral Writings make themselves odious, as others by their trifling and empty Efforts, become ridiculous to the wise and vertuous: None but well writ Pieces, that concern all Mankind, and that bring equal Benefit and Pleasure to all Ages, writ in a true Taste and upon Subjects of a general and everlasting Nature, will be esteem'd and applauded by good Judges hereafter. that we perceive in the Animal World; the lowest and most despicable Kind are a numberless Race of Insect Writers, who are all of a short but various Continuance; some during their short Life, always creep upon the Ground; and some getting Wings, take a few Flights and then entirely disappear; some by their Nature and Constitution enjoy the Duration only of a Day; some expire in a few Weeks; some a little stronger, struggle harder with their Fate, and are perhaps some Months in dying; while other Productions, tho far from a vigorous native Complexion, supported by numbers of bad Judges, last some Years, and then decay and sink into Oblivion: Those only of the most perfect Kind, that are writ with Judgment, good Sense, Spirit and elegant Expression, will long abide the Test, disappoint the Malice of Enemies, and maintain their applauded Character to future Generations. whatever is of foreign Mixture, that enhans'd the Esteem of any Writing in the present, will be separated by the future Ages: and therefore what adventitious Merit and unnative Beauty any Works receiv'd from the Popularity of a favour'd Author, from biass'd Judges, fortunate Accidents, a Party-Interest, and the reigning Passions of the Times, will all vanish, and the Piece being reduc'd to its intrinsick Value, will pass with Posterity, who will disregard the Stamp of the present Authority, for no more than it really weighs; and this will occasion a great Discount upon many Works that are truly valuable, when future Criticks shall, with impartial Judgment and unprejudic'd Taste, extract from them all the false Merit that heighten'd their Esteem from any of the above-mention'd Considerations. The Species of Writing are numerous as diversify'd and distinguish'd by their Subject; I shall only take notice of two sorts, namely, Controversial and Polite. Penetration and discoursive Faculty, which are requir'd to qualify Men for Polemical Discourses; and those Persons whom Nature has furnish'd with Judgment and Capacity, must be accustom'd to read the most eminent Authors on Subjects of Controversy, and be well exercis'd and train'd to solid Reasoning, close Debates and Disputations, before their Pens will be accomplish'd for this difficult and important Province. As Truth often lies entangled with such specious Mixtures of Falshood, that a sharp and distinguishing Taste is demanded to abstract and free it from opposite and repugnant Complications, and shew it in its pure and genuine Splendor; so Error has frequently such a plausible and shining Appearance, in which we meet with so many Lines and Features, which imitate and resemble Truth, that it easily imposes on vulgar and credulous Understandings, tho it cannot escape the Observation and Discovery of Men of Sagacity and clear Judgment, long vers'd in detecting such Counterseits and unmasking the Imposture; such able Writers with wonderful Readiness and Perspicuity, unravel difficult and knotty Subjects, and grapple with the Adversary with superior Strength, triumph in every. Page, bear down all before them, and spread the Field of Disputation with the Spoils of defeated Opponents. happy are the Students in Theology and Philosophy, who have Wisdom enough to chuse and stick to these admirable Authors, or into whose Hands they fall by good Fortune or the prudent Advice of others: For these accomplish'd Masters, that by the resistless Light of their Reason, with great facility penetrate and dispel the Mists and Error that hang upon and eclipse the Face of Truth, will in the Compass of a few Pages, convince and instruct them infinitely more than the shallow Productions of a light and volatile Genius, or the heavy and prolix Volumes of muddy Heads, who bewilder'd in their own undigested Notions darken the Disputation, confound the Reader by their insignificant Labour; and explain their Subject till it becomes unintelligible. those; who to the strength, closeness and perspicuity of their Reasoning, add fine Temper and genteel Humanity. These Qualities gain immediately upon the Reader, and leave him prejudic'd in favour of the Disputant, by which Means his unobstructed good Sense finds easy Admission to the Mind, and cannot fail of producing deep and lasting Impressions. the immoderate Heat and Fierceness of his Passion, but in the Strength and resistless Violence of his Arguments; not in big Words, arrogant Assurance and Airs of Authority, but in the commanding Force of his Demonstration. to the indifferent Reader, so it is most likely to gain upon the Opponent, who by such Candour, good Usage and respectful Expression, is more dispos'd to entertain and weigh the Evidence, and yield up the Cause to superior Reason. Decency, Benevolence, and good Breeding, which they all along express'd to the Person, whose Notions, however, they endeavour to subject; but the highest Instance of Civility of this kind, has been lately shown by the Author of the Freeholders . This polite and learned Writer, in his Fortieth Paper, opposes and Opinion, which I advanc'd in the Preface to to my former Essays; but while he attempts to prove that I am mistaken, he treats me in so handsome a manner, and expresses such Respect and Gentlemanlike Decency, that it might tempt a Man to publish an Error on purpose to be thus confuted. In this he has set an admirable Example to Polemical Pens, which it is highly to be wish'd they would strive to imitate. Would our Writers engag'd in Controversy dismiss their sharp Invectives, and forbear all personal Reflections foreign and impertinent to their Subject; would they stop the malignant Eruptions of their Pride and Anger, restrain the bitter Eructations of their Spleen and Choler, and cease by ironical Compassion, insultingly to commiserate the Weakness and Ignorance of the Opponent; would they rely on the Force of their Reason, and not on the Strength and Virulence of their Passion, and treat each other with the Temper, Candor and fine Humanity of this instructive, as well as entertaining Author, they would afford the Reader much greater Pleasure, and use the most likely Conduct to convince their Opponent. Reading and deep Knowledge, yet unacquainted with human Nature and polite Conversation engages with an Adversary, the Effect is quite different: For when this rough Champion enters the Lists of Disputation with all his scholastick Accoutrements, brandishes his rusty and heavy Weapons, and with Looks of Defiance, pronounces certain Destruction to his Opponent, and lays about him with his Definitions, Ergo's and Quod erat Demonstrandum's , till crown'd, as he thinks, with Victory, he proudly insults his vanquish'd Enemy; such a Combatant, I say, rather terrifies than entertains, and while he is admir'd by the Ignorant, is despis'd by the wise and discerning Reader. This Person, tho it should be suppos'd that his Cause is good and that his Reasons are availing, yet his rude and arrogant Manner of managing the Dispute, where the pure recluse Scholar appears unpolish'd by the Gentleman, is so ungrateful, that his Labours are generally disregarded and thrown aside. passionate, if he leaves his Subject to upbraid the Stupidity and bewail the Incapacity and Stubborness of his Opponent, if he throws out Invectives and abounds with ill Manners and Scurrility, this Writer will never succeed but with his own Party, who perhaps, in their own Breasts likewise condemn him: And tho the Satyr should be ever so fine and well turn'd, yet if it is pointed against the Person of the Author and not against his Opinions, it will become a great Prejudice to his Cause. and touble the regular Operations of his own Faculties; for no Man ruffled with Passion can preserve clear Conceptions and a right Judgment, so he will do his Adversary great Service, who if a Man of Temper will not fail to take the Advantage of his Competitor's Disorder. Besides, the Reader will not only be shock'd by the Indecencies of passionate and misbecoming Language, but will conclude, that the Author's Disturbance arises from want of Argument and convincing Light; for why will he say, should a Conqueror be out of Humour, or a Disputant be angry and uneasy, who is conscious that the Evidence of Truth is on his Side? This likewise is the most likely way to prevent the Writer's principal Design, that is, the Conviction of his Opponent and the Change of his Opinion; for he being irritated by such sharp Provocations; will stand upon his Defence with greater Resolution. Proud and splenetick Expression is so far from promoting the End of the Writer in bringing over his Adversary to his Side, that it rather exasperates and provokes him, ruffles his Temper, and kindles in him those disorderly Heats, that dispose him to meditate Revenge, to dip his Pen in Gall, and for a Reply prepare a sharp and ill-natur'd Invective; and while these Polemical Gladiators engage in Combate on the Theatre of the Schools, and give to their Weapons the keenest Edge. while they redouble their Blows, and cut and wound each other with inexorable Fury, instead of instructing the World by striking out new Light, they only raise the Laughter of their Enemies and the Pity of their Friends. Stile, which is peculiar to the Poet and the Orator, yet he is oblig'd to use proper, pure and significant Words, which will convey his Sense in the clearest, warmest and most easy manner; and tho he must not pretend to enliven it with pompous and swelling Sentences, metaphorical Diction and allegorical Allusions, yet it is desirable he should infuse into his Writing so much Spirit, and give it such agreeable Turns, as may entertain the Reader and keep him attentive to the Instruction he communicates. An eminent Instance of Controversy manag'd in this manner is Archbishop Tillotson's Rule of Faith , which gives the Reader great Pleasure, while it convinces him by resistless Argument. Prolix and voluminous Works, where the Disputation is spun out by numerous probable Topicks, and oppress'd with endless Citations and impertinent Learning, after the Point in Question has been before evinc'd by one or two clear Demonstrations, is to extend the Argument to a tedious and disagreeable Length: and much more will such a Production be displeasing, if Perspicuity, which should save the pain of close Attention, is wanting: Some eminent Writers diffuse and enlarge their Discourses too much, while they turn and wind, and vary the same Sentiments, out of a Diffidence that they never explain their Meaning enough, or from too great a Distrust of their Reader, who they think will not apprehend their Sense, unless it be inculcated by endless Repetitions; and others, who from an over balance of Flegm and sluggish Ferments in their Constitution derive their slow and cloudy Understandings, swell their Writings with exuberant Expression, grow voluminous, and being unable to explain their Meaning, with great Sweat and Labour, form an incoherent Scheme of Disputation: These Persons bewilder'd and confounded in the Obscurity and Disorder of their Ideas, resemble a sort of Men, who advanc'd to publick Employments, are Self- sufficient, and in their own Opinion accomplish'd, without native Genius or acquir'd Endowments, enterprizing without Capacity, inquisitive without Penetration, circumspect without Caution, and curious without Discernment, and who with an Air of Gravity and Importance, after long insignificant Application and inactive Diligence, with much ado dispatch no Business. not only to all Kinds of Writing, but likewise to the Works of Architecture, Musick and Painting, yet by Custom, which the Masters of Polite Literature have introduc'd, it is principally restrain'd to elegant Compositions in Verse and Prose; and under this limited Notion, I shall use that Term in the following Discourse. immense Stock of Ideas, that are purely Spiritual and Intellectual; such are her Notions of the Existence and Perfections of the Divine Being acquir'd by Reasoning, universal Ideas of one common Nature procur'd by her Capacity of Comparing and Abstracting, and her Knowledge of Conclusions arising from a Power of Calculating and Deducing a Train of Consequences from self-evident or demonstrated Principles; yet must it likewise be allow'd, that the Discernment of her own Nature and Capacities is so narrow and imperfect, and that during her vital Complication with the Body, she has so much Pleasure and Satisfaction in sensitive Perceptions, which were her most early and familiar Acquaintance, and gave the first Occasion to her more refin'd and intellectual Acquisitions, that she is often oblig'd to borrow metaphorical Ideas from the Organs of the Body, to express the Operations of her own Faculties. Sometimes she takes those Representations from the Eye, while she uses these various Phrases, intellectual Light, a bright Imagination, and beautiful Sentiments, fine Painting, delicate Touches, and admirable Strokes in Writing; sometimes the Soul derives her Ideas from the Sense of Feeling, for instance, a sharp and piercing Judgment; sometimes from the Ear, as the Harmony of intellectual Powers or Passions; sometimes from the Smell, as the Sagacity of her Faculties; but the chief Metaphor by which she expresses her Operations is borrow'd from the Organs of Taste, which when apply'd to Writing, signifies a Capacity of the Mind to discern the Conformity of the Conceptions of the Writer to the true Nature of Things; or more fully, Taste is a clear solid and distinguishing Judgment, by which a Man is enabled to discover the Beauties and Perfections, and to point out the Errors and Blemishes of an Author, not in respect to their Congruity or Repugnance to the Dictates and Rules of Aristotle , or the Authority of any other celebrated ancient or modern Critick, but to the Decrees and Determinations of right Reason; which implies likewise a Capacity to observe the Agreement or Dissimilitude between the Words and Sentences and the Sentiments of the Authors, which they were intended to represent. This is the general Notion of Taste, as apply'd to Writings. But most frequently, as I said before, it is taken in a more confin'd Sense, and then it signifies a critical Judgment exercis'd on ingenious and polite Discourses, and is restrain'd to Oratorical Productions, Epick and Lyrick Poems, Dramatical Compositions, Romantick Fables, and Pieces of Wit and Humour, as well Modern as Ancient. most remote from each other, according to their different Education, Customs and Complexions. The figurative, pompous and diffusive manner of Expression that is agreeable and applauded in the Courts of Eastern Princes, is shocking and extravagant, and founds like Fustian and Bombast to the politer Parts of Europe ; and their Metaphors are so strong and daring, that they often rather excite Displeasure and Contempt, than Delight and Admiration. Nor is it to be doubted but the Speeches and Writings, which we esteem as correct and elegant, appear to them flat and insipid. Nor does the neighbouring Kingdoms of Europe agree in their Relish and Opinion concerning the most perfect manner of Writing. Italy, France, Spain and Great-Britain , have their peculiar Judgments on this Subject, arising from their different Manners, Humours and Disposition of Mind. Nations often change their Relish, and at different Times disagree with themselves. The Romans , in the Infancy of their Empire, were rude and unpolite, but as they grew in Power, they by degrees became more elegant and distinguishing, (for Polite Letters decay or flourish in proportion to the Diminution or Encrease of Dominion) till they arriv'd to their greatest Perfection of Judgment in the Reign of Augustus : But as the Roman Monarchy declin'd in Strength, the fine Taste of that famous Age declin'd with it, till at length it was extinguish'd by the barbarous Invaders from the North: and after the Restitution of Learning in Italy , how long did the Gothick Taste prevail in the Colleges of Learning, and infect the Natives of the greatest Genius? Empty Speculations, abstruse Metaphysical Subtilties and Theological Cobwebs, accommodated to Aristotle's dark Philosophy, and express'd in the most unelegant and disagreeable Phrase, were a long Time the chief Writings in Fashion; and it was not till after many Centuries that the modern Wits, who began to disrelish this rude and coarse manner, attempted to clear Learning from its Rust, to free the Schools from immense Heaps of Philosophical Lumber, and gradually introduce a more just and polite Taste. remarkable in other Kingdoms, particularly in this of Great-Britain . After the Norman Conquest, the prevailing Enchantment of Romantick Fables, not only possess'd the finer Spirits of Italy and the neighbouring Nations, and filled the principal Kingdoms of Europe with Tales of surprizing Adventures, and the incredible Atchievements of Erratic Knights in Favour of distress'd Beauties, the Creatures of Imagination and the Entertainments of idle Pens; but it likewise extended its Power to Great-Britain , and gave the Monks, almost the only Authors there in that dark and illiterate Age, a wrong Notion of Writing, as appears by the fabulous Mixtures and the Air of Romance in their Historical Narrations. Learning, great Genius and Abilities for Disputation; yet it must be own'd, that the Taste of the Age, as to Polite Literature, continu'd unreformed. Mr. Spencer , the celebrated Poet of those Times, while our Language was low and unrefin'd, writ in a false Italian Taste, corrupted by the Romantick Fables that pleas'd, as said before, the Men of superior Parts in that Age, which much abated the Dignity and Merit of his excellent Compositions. In the following Reign a vicious Taste was introduc'd, by which the rude and unpolish'd Writers were so far mistaken in the true Notion of Wit and Elegance, that they thought it consisted in a gingling Play with Words of the same Sound, but equivocal in Signification. This trifling Humour, sporting with ambiguous Terms to please the Times, universally infected the Press, and blemish'd the Pieces of the most eminent Writers: Nor did the Pulpit, notwithstanding the Gravity and Importance of the Preacher's Subject, escape the misbecoming Ornaments of this tinsel Eloquence; and tho the present Age have justly this puerile Wit in Contempt, that in the former Reigns was in Fashion, yet in one Instance, and that of great Moment, our Taste continues unreform'd, and that despicable sort of Wit is still received with Pleasure and Applause, and that is, when Words of a double signification, which is the Foundation of the old exploded way of facetious Writing, are employ'd to loose and immodest Purposes: for then they are still very agreeable and made the most entertaining Parts of the Comedy, which is senseless and insipid, if not animated and heighten'd by those impure Mixtures: And thus far the Taste of the present Age, however otherwise polite, is altogether coarse and uncultivated; and I cannot imagine but the ingenious Writers of such loose Pieces are themselves conscious that this easy and almost unavoidable Kind of Wit, which results only from a congruity of Words in Sound but not in Meaning, and which they despise and deride, when they are us'd upon other Subjects and for other Purposes than to raise obscene Ideas, and gratify the vitiated Taste of a degenerate Age, is low and contemptible. their Mistake in this Article, and soon expos'd the ridiculous way of Writing, that consisted only in chiming Syllables of ambiguous Sense, excepting in the Instance before nam'd; but then they ran into the contrary Extream: From an Aversion justly conceiv'd against the poor sort of Wit which I have mention'd, they fell into the pompous Romantick Stile; and whereas the Diction of the Writers and Preachers before was dry and jejune, they now oppress'd it with a Luxury of splendid Words, and the superfluous Ornaments of figurative Expression. This faulty Manner took its Rise from the numerous Romances that were the great Delight of Gentlemen and Ladies, after the Return of King Charles . At that time fabulous Stories, Books and Sermons, compos'd in that Stile, were valu'd as consummate Pieces, while good Sense and the Exercise of Reason were suspended, to make way for the empty Pomp of false Eloquence: But in a few Years a happier Taste succeeded; the admir'd Roman Fables and incredible Adventures began to sink in their Credit, till they became neglected and at last exploded; and as their Reputation decay'd, so the florid and swelling Stile, which in imitation of that was observ'd in other Authors, was disrelish'd and decry'd; and now a more pure, correct, and rational way of Writing was introduc'd into the room of the other, which was strong but not turgid, chaste but not dry, Ornamental but not Gaudy, rich without Profusion, and clear without Redundancy: And this critical Taste has prevail'd, till by degrees Writing is at this Time improv'd to such a degree of Perfection, that perhaps no new Mode will be taken up by Posterity but to disadvantage. This I speak in respect of our well writ Books in Prose, and I may as truly affirm it of those in Verse. Before the two great Reformers Denbam and Waller flourish'd, poetical Pieces show'd that the Authors had little Taste of the Beauties of Diction, and the Purity, Propriety and Splendor of Words; of the Harmony of Numbers, the Dignity of figurative Expression, and the Art of Versification: all which are now carry'd up to such a height, that perhaps, however Words may change, the present Stile may not be exceeded in future Times. Talents in loose and prophane Productions; for this contradicts the End, and destroys the Usefulness of Writing, which is to delight and improve the Mind, or in fuller Expression, to convey to it Moral Instruction by the insinuating Force of Pleasure. Nor is it a less Corruption of Taste in the People, who encourage and applaud those shameless Pens, which are prostituted to the Service of Irreligion and Vice, and engag'd to oppose with the utmost Malice and Rancour, the Interests of Heaven and Vertue, and by propagating Impiety and degenerate Manners, are labouring to pull down their own Altars, and bring Destruction upon themselves, their native Land and late Posterity. their Country and Religion, saw the People delighted with Papers which lately came Abroad as daily Entertainments; in which rich Genius and polite Talents were employ'd in their proper Province, that is, to recommend Vertue and regular Life, and to discourage and discountenance the Follies, Faults and Vices of the Age; Men, I say, of Principle, that declar'd against the irreligious and prosligate Party, who had gain'd great ground upon Piety and sober Life, to the Hazard as well as Dishonour of the Nation, were pleas'd that such able and masterly Authors enter'd the Lists with so much Courage and so well arm'd, to combate Vice and flagitious Manners: Nor was it without good Effect, for the People in some measure recover'd their true Relish, and discern'd the Benefit and moral Advantages, as well as the Beauties of these daily Pieces, and began to have profane and immodest Writings in Contempt. and Indignation observe, that a petulant Set of Writers, who have no way to Popularity and Fame but by making their Court to the Vices and Follies of the Age, from a rooted and inflexible Enmity to Piety and Vertue, and immortal Hatred to good Men, had undertaken by their immodest and flagitious Papers, to defeat the good and great Design of the Writers before nam'd, to efface the laudable Impressions which they had made on the Minds of Men, and restore the vitiated Taste from which they seem'd in a good degree to have bern deliver'd. Pity it is, if we regard the Honour of Religion, or Safety and flourishing State of the Kingdom, that such malignant Pens should be suffer'd to pour down their Poison on the wholesome Seeds of Morality, blast in the Bud the generous Plants, and destroy our Expectations from that promising Nursery of vertuous and wise Instruction, which the others had cultivated and improv'd with so much Application, Zeal and Ingenuity. Pity it is, that these intrepid Conspirators against Heaven and Religion, animated with deliberate Malice, should go on by their impious Turns of Wit and Raillery, to expose all modest and prudent Behaviour, and give the last Blow, if they are able, to Sobriety of Manners; and thus by recovering and confirming the vitiated Relish of the Nation, undo all that the other Writers by their excellent Labours have, to their great Honour, done in the Service of Vertue and their Country. I cannot but here take notice, that one of these Champions of Vice is the reputed Author of a detestable Paper, that has lately been handed about in Manuscript, and now appears in Print, in which the godless Author has burlesqu'd the First Psalm of David in so obscene and profane a manner, that perhaps no Age ever saw such an insolent Affront offer'd to the establish'd Religion of their Country, and this, good Heaven! with Impunity. A sad Demonstration this, of the low Ebb to which the British Vertue is reduc'd in these degenerate Times. the Fruition of the greatest Good, the Author of his Being; and those, who with a superior Esteem and prevalent Desire, direct their Aims to any other Object of Happiness, whether it be to gratify their Ambition, Avarice, voluptuous Appetites or Thirst of Glory, by alienating their Inclinations and diverting their Pursuits from the Fountain of Goodness, set up another final Cause instead of the Divine Being, whom they reject and depose, and by so doing break the Subordination between an intelligent Creature and his Creator. Statesman, the Magistrate, the Warrior, and all other subordinate Classes, should terminate in this End; and all their Undertakings and Schemes of Life ought to be so chosen and form'd, that they may be subservient to this supream and last Design. Hence there is no doubt but that the End of Writing likewise is to promote the Honour of the Divine Being, and the Writer's own Happiness: which he pursues, as often as his Pen is employ'd in conveying Intellectual or Moral Instruction to others, in filling their Minds with great and useful Ideas, and raising generous and worthy Passions, in opposing Vice and Looseness of Manners, and exciting the Reader to engage or continue stedfast in the Practice of Vertue; and in order to this, he ought to give his Reader all the Pleasure and Entertainment that his Genius will afford or his Subject admit. Understanding, and inspire laudable Passions and Resolutions, by propagating Divine, Natural and Moral Science; as their ultimate End, to which the former is subordinate; is their endless Felicity in the Fruition of the supream Being; and therefore I must ask leave of the ingenious Author of the Freeholder , to offer Reasons that oblige me to differ from his Sentiments on this Subject: In No. 40. his Words are these, It would be well for all Authors if they knew when to give over , and to desist from any farther Pursuits after Fame, whilst they are in the full Possession of it. Applause is the principal End of Writing; for otherwise why does the Author assert, that after a Man is in full Possession of it, it is a Mark of Wisdom to lay down the Pen, desist from farther Attempts, and so rise with a winning Hand? But it is certain, that after an Author has gain'd the greatest Reputation, he may still pursue the generous and worthy Design before mention'd, that is, the Improvement of Mankind by variety of beneficial Instruction; and it being undeniable that this should be the principal End of every Writer, and not the procuring of Praise and Glory to himself, he will always be obliged to employ his Talents in doing Good to Mankind, by enlarging their Knowledge, correcting their Errors, and removing their Ignorance, after he is arrived to the greatest height of Fame and Popularity; and indeed his Obligations will be then much stronger, as he is more able and fit for that Province. I believe therefore that the Evidence of Reason is on my side, whilst I affirm, that an Author, who is honour'd with the greatest Affluence of Applause, may not only be allow'd, but is oblig'd, to communicate to the World speculative Knowledge and prudent Maxims of Morality, till Men be come so wise and good, as to need no farther Improvement. I appeal to this Gentleman himself, who by his admirable Pen has deserv'd so well of his Country, whether Fame or Glory was the attractive Object to which he directed his Aim. To me it appears that he had other more worthy and generous Designs in view, since not only his serious and solid, but likewise his facetious Discourses, which are fullest of Wit and Humour, generally contain some conspicuous and considerable Moral. Maxim he has laid down; for after he himself had justly acquir'd a great Name, he continu'd to publish his ingenious and useful Writings, particularly this of the Freeholder , as well as other valuable Pieces, which otherwise had been lost to the World; and this shews, that he pursu'd more excellent Ends than that of gaining Praise; and why then should he suggest that Advice to others, which he to his great Honour has rejected himself? Nor are we without Hope, but that he will still entertain and instruct the Nation with more Productions of equal Merit with his former. Had Sir Isaac Newton , when in the full Possession of Fame, resolv'd to publish no other Works, his admirable Discoveries about the Nature of Light had never been produc'd, nor would the World be hereafter oblig'd by those learned Labours which we yet expect from that famous Hand. If we regard the Ancients, Had Sophocles and Euripedes laid down the Pen after their Victories had establish'd their Fame, how great a part of their admirable Writings had been uncompil'd? should be extended likewise to great Warriors, Architects and Painters, who would do well to give over after they have attain'd superior Reputation. But had Prince Eugene , before the last Campaign, determin'd to retire and act no more in the Field, as he ought to have done according to this Maxim, he being then rais'd to the highest Glory and Renown, Christendom might have lost the most seasonable and wonderful Victory, that is recorded in Story, over its powerful and implacable Enemy. When Angelo had built the unparalell'd Church of St. Peter , and Raphael had painted his Transfigurations, ought they to have stood still for ever, without attempting any other Work? Prudence to desist, lest he should by after Performances, less valuable than the former, weaken or sink his great Reputation; and says, that there is not a more melancholy Object in the learned World, than an Author who has writ himself down. It must be observ'd, that by this Author , he means one that is in full Possession of Fame, as he said immediately before: And then I reply, that whatever has happen'd to Men of inferior Talents and unsettled Reputation, that no Author of the first Rank, one who had gain'd establish'd Credit and general Esteem, was ever so unfortunate as to become such a melancholy Object. Notwithstanding there is a great Inequality in the Performances of eminent Men, for a good Writer does not always write alike, tho a bad one does, which was the judicious Remark of a great Man, the late Earl of Dorset , yet the People continue to pay them the Respect and Honour due to their Works of singular Merit. Did Mr. Dryden , by those Pieces in which he wrote below himself, sink the Credit of his best Works? And notwithstanding his lower Performances, is he not still a celebrated Author? Did Paradise Regain'd destroy the Reputation of Paradise Lost ? And is not that Author still applauded as the great Ornament and Glory of his Country, tho many of his Writings are disrelish'd and unregarded? And numerous Instances of the like Nature may be produc'd: So that I shall without hesitation affirm, that, as far as I know, no History from the beginning of Time affords one single Example of an extraordinary Writer, one according to our Author's Expression, in the full Possession of Fame, who ever wrote that Fame away, and so became an Object of Compassion. these Passages, which I presume could not but through Inadvertency drop from such an ingenious and able Pen, lest young Authors should be misguided, as to the true End of Writing, by the Authority of so great a Name. Pleasure of delicate Wine and rich Meats, while they do not place their Felicity in sensual Delights, but intend by them to recreate their Spirits and renew their Vigour for the Returns of Contemplation or Business; so an Author may taste the Satisfaction of Fame and Applause, provided he do it in subserviency to a more excellent Moral End; and particucularly he may rejoice in it, as he looks upon it to be a means by which the Usefulness of his Writings may become more lasting and extensive. In this Case a regular Disposition of Mind lies between the two Extreams, an immoderate Tenderness and Care about Success and Reputation, and a downright Indifference and Carelessness concerning it. As the last fills the World with empty or imperfect Productions, so the first defrauds it of many excellent Works. Hence it came, that Sir Walter Rawleigh , from too great a Resentment, which he conceiv'd upon the Representation of the Publisher that his History of the World met with an indifferent Reception, burnt a Second Volume, the loss of which has been much lamented; and from a timerous Opinion, which Virgil had, that his Epick Poem was not so correct and finish'd as to merit the greatest Frame and Approbation, from too nice a Concern for his Honour, he condemn'd it to the Flames; and thus had not his Will been over-rul'd, the Commonwealth of Letters had lost a Work that has been the Delight and Admiration of all succeeding Ages. capable of Works of Invention and Imagination, for Prose-Exercises of Wit and Humour, Sports of Fancy and declamatory Eloquence; as also for Sonnets, Papers of Verses, and all the lower Species of Poetry, where no Strength of Judgment is required to contrive a Plan, or carry on any great and important Design; yet if some extraordinary Persons, Prodigies of Sense and Genius, of whom perhaps, not above Three or Four fall to the Share of any one Nation in half a Century, are excepted, Men are not qualify'd to write well upon great Subjects, where acute and solid Reason, deep Penetration, and great Learning are requir'd, till they approach to their Thirtieth Year: they are therefore unfit not only to engage in difficult and important Controversies of Theology, Philosophy and Politicks, but likewise to attempt the superior Poetry, whether of the Epick, Lyrick, or Tragick Kind. The Reason that supports this Observation is, that before Men are advanc'd to such a Period of Life, as they have not by Study, Reading and Conversation acquir'd a sufficient Maturity of Taste, nor enough digested their Notions, so have they not stock'd their Understandings with such plenty of Ideas, as should enable them to succeed in such great Undertakings. And if young Men, who are unequal to Polemical Discourses and the sublime Poetry, could restrain their Passion, deny themselves the Pleasure of appearing in Print, and withstand the Temptation of being call'd Authors; could they forbear to grasp the Pen, and be contented to continue diligent and modest Learners, and endeavour to enrich their Minds by Reflection, Books and thoughtful Observation, till they had reach'd the Stage of Life that I have mention'd, they would set out from the Press with greater Advantage, and the World would not be oppress'd with so many jejune Pieces, and such abundance of crude and abortive Productions. Complexion, come early to their Parts, and like Summer Fruit thrive and ripen apace, while others of a less sprightly and volatile Constitution, advance slowly to Maturity: The first make a fine Bloom and quickly bring forth, but the last are most capable of strong and durable Productions. Some of a rich Genius like a fat and generous Soil, that is mown twice a Year, are never impoverish'd; while others must often lie fallow, like hilly and barren Lands, that want Rest, and require the genial Nitre of the Air, to recruit their prolifick Power; some by hard Study and Application have furnish'd their Minds with an immense Stock of Ideas, and are not therefore so easily exhausted, as those who have taken little Care to hoard up such plentiful Stores and enrich their Minds with Treasures of Science. I know it will be allow'd by all, that Persons advanc'd in Years are most capable of Writings, which require Judgment, Learning and long Observation, but some will not grant that they are sit for Works of Invention and Fancy; for that Endowment they look upon as peculiar to Youth; but this Opinion is founded on a Mistake: Our famous Milton wrote his Paradise Lost , at least a great part of it, and his Sampson Agonistes , in the last Stages of his Life; and yet his admirable Genius shines forth in those poetical Works more than in all his former Performances. It is allowed by the best Judges, that Mr. Dryden 's last Poems excelled those he had writ before, and that his grey Hairs, which ripen'd his Judgment and improv'd his Reason, had not in the least abated, and much less extinguished his poetical Fire. Nations. It is true, that Judgment is justly allow'd to be generally the Possession and Ornament of Men in Years; but it is as true, that those who were ever in their past Life endow'd with an inventive Genius, fine Spirit and lively Imagination, always preserv'd those Qualities as long as they preserv'd their other Intellectual Abilities; and it is no wonder that Men of an advanced Age should not be Masters of a strong and sprightly Fancy, which was never their Talent in their Youth; for how can it be expected that those, who had only a plain Understanding and a solid Capacity from their Cradle, should have it flower'd and enrich'd with all the Ornaments and Splendor produc'd by a spiritful Imagination, which Nature never gave them? continue so till Fifty, and by the Improvement of Practice and Experience, will yet acquire a maturer Judgment and a more accomplish'd Pen, provided his Constitution remains hail and vigorous; and the Parity of Reason will be extended to Sixty Years, and so forwards, if the Health of the Author does not decay by the weak and valetudinary State of his Body, nor is diminish'd or broken by the Infirmities of Age, derived from the Immoralities of Youth. And as this is in Theory clear, so it is evident in Fact, as will presently appear: And it is my Opinion, that it will be difficult to produce any Examples of Men, who ever lost the Force of their Imagination (for what they never had they cannot be said to have lost) till by a general Decay of Body, their Reason, Memory and Judgment were as much impair'd as their lighter Faculties. will occur that confirm my Observation. Sophocles , the Prince of Tragick Writers, among his numerous Pieces, wrote one of his Tragedies at Fourscore Years of Age, which he produc'd before the Judges as an Evidence of his sound Mind and unimpair'd Faculties, when he was represented by his Son as broken with Age and uncapable of the Management of his Estate and Business. Homer, Euripides, Pindar and many others, retain'd their Vigour and extent of Fancy through the whole Course of a long Life: nor did the eloquent Cicero discover any loss of Spirits and Imagination in his last Writings, as appears by his admirable Works, particularly his Book de Senectute , writ with the Judgment of an old, and the Vivacity of a young Man. But suppose, that in old Men the Imagination should be much weaken'd, yet I cannot see that by their Years they are less capable of Writings that contain Reflections upon human Nature, tho this likewise is asserted by the Author before-cited. On the contrary, by their great Experience and long Attention to the Passions, Customs and Manners of Men, and all the Varieties of their Actions, they acquire a more certain, as well as a more extensive Knowledge of the Nature of Man; and this not being the Business of Invention and Fancy, but of a just Application and a penetrating and comprehensive Judgment, it is very plain that old Men are most fit for this Province. But as to the Season when the Pen should be laid down, it is various and undetermin'd, according to the Health and Vigour of the Author in any Period of Life whatsoever; for when his Intellectual Faculties of themselves decay and his Spirit evaporates, or if they sink by the Infirmities of the Body, he is grown too Old to write, at whatever Time it happens. leave off when he has done, and not to be carry'd on by an impotent desire of Writing till he becomes disagreeble; and it is to be hoped, that in such a Case the Bookseller will stop the Author, and prevent the Care of his Friends, who might otherwise be obliged by a good natur'd Violence to wrest his Pen out of his Hand, as we disseize a Man of his Sword, who is about to plunge it in his own Breast. respect of the native Strength of their Constitution; some are form'd of tender and delicate Fibres, and mov'd by Spirits too much rarify'd and expanded, whence they are soon fatigu'd and subject to Waste and Dissipation. These weakly and washy Wits, not being able to undergo the Fatigue of voluminous Writers, are soon spent and run off their Metal; while others, on whom, if the Expression may be allowed, Nature has bestow'd a vigorous, sinewy, and athletick Faculties, Persons who have Bodies as well as Souls, and Limbs as well as Heads to qualify them for lasting Labour, whose Spirits are firm and consistent, as well as bright and active, and have no less the Strength
