 I haue aduentured to present you with this Historie, written in my trauels at Sea, being sundry times employed by Gentlemen of honorable account, and famous for their seruices done. Which importeth the famous actions of a King, a Scholler, & a Souldier, wherin you shall see the greatnes of Maiestie, the hardy aduentures of Knight-hood with his bounty, how many Challenges was made to gaine Fame, his learning shewing a Scholler, and his quaint conceits courting his loue, al concurring in this Paragon of honour. Albeit, it is not so beautified, as might deserue to be graced by one so worthy as your selfe, who shewing to be the sonne of your honorable Father, is not onely a Souldier professed, but a louer of discipline, and a fauourer of the religious. Which vertues, he that giueth all encrease, continue in you & yours, that your name may liue to the worlds end, in all honour, and after death, you may haue those ioyes which neuer shall end. From my house, neare All-gate, London this 12. of February, 1617. Your Worships in all duty, euer to bee commaunded, H. Robarts . perils on the seas, I haue recouered the hauen of my desire, and haue brought for your delight, this stranger Knight, a Prince borne, endued with much honour, who being a man famous, as his actions importeth. Albeit my skill is not such as is required, yet haue I taken vpon me a Pilots charge, and in safety haue set him ashore, where his desire led him, vnto whom Gentiles, my hope is, your accustomed fauour to all strangers shall not be denied, being a Caualare of Fame: how plainely soeuer you see him attired, yet accept him, and as a Traueller comming of good will, bid him welcome, and with fauour peruse his honours in Armes gained, which I hope may in some sorte delight you if happily it proue as I desire, hee hath his wish. But how soeuer, discountenance him not altogether, whose will is to deserue well. Abrubt faults, hee may vnwillinglie commit many, which if according to your accustomed curtesies, you vouchsafe to pardon, and after his long trauell with carefull trouble to delight you, receiue but the least shew of good liking, it is all hee expecteth: your courtesie is more then the cost, from which as your Englishmen and Gentiles allianate, so shall hee endeuour to deserue better, and shall in his trauell hereafter report of you as you are,  & bind me his carefull Pilot, your Countryman, through whose procurement he is come hither, to your humble seruice. Yours euer, H. R. How Dionisius Prince of Numedia , vpon report of the exceeding beauty of Nutania , daughter and heire to Thelarcus , King of Thrace , became inamored, and fell into an extreame passion, whose sicknes the king  & queene father and mother of Dionisius , so much grieued to behold, that their griefes caused their perils of life. What time Manpelious raigned King in Numedia , as their ancient annuals record, Thelarchus likewise swayed the Diademe in Thrace , a Prince so highly renowmed for all honourable actions, as few such in his time liued This Thelarchus in the blooming of his Princely yeeres, desirous to leaue issue to his Noble house, ioyned in marriage with Alinda daughter and sole heyre to Constantius , Emperour of Germany , by whom in short time after their Nuptials, hee had issue one daughter, who was named Nutania . This Princesse, as in comelinesse of person shee exceeded, so for her beautie, wisedome, and other good graces, there liued none her equall: the report of whose excellence, as Fame aduanceth with her loudest trumpe, the honorable, especially, such peerelesse creatures, as this Princesse (yea) so highly stood she graced in the Gods fauour, that none but Nutanias beauty was remembred in most Princes Courts, both christian and heathen. The renowne of whose peerelesse beauty, so often blazed, came to the hearing of Dionicius , son and heire apparant of the Numedian king, who vpon the surpassing praises by euery one giuen of this Lady, begun more and more vpon hearing such seuerall reportes, to conceyue an inwarde ioy of her, diligently hearkning to each stranger which should recount her vertues, and honour by vertue gayned. Long had not this honour followed the louely Prince Dionisius , but loue tho soueraigne guide of mens thoughts, had so enthralled him, that all his delight was in contemplating of this Princesse beautie, yea, so was he ouertaken in loues snare, that nothing was pleasing vnto him, but the sweet remembrance of Nutania : so much was his delight in her, that oftentimes, in the midst of his pastimes, calling the Princesse to minde, hee would as one past himselfe, altogether ouercome with melancholy, abandon the company of his most familiars, seeking from their pleasing pastimes som solitary place, where he might unheard or seen recount wt large amplifications the Princes beauty, whose seruant in minde he was wholly vewed. Thus dallied Dionisius so long with beauties flame, that ouertaken with the vehemency thereof, he fell into an extreme feuer, which in such strange manner assayled him, as the learnedst Physitians could not finde any reason of the disease, much lesse procure his health, who languished in loue, not daring to disclose his griefe to any, or acquaint his trustiest companion with his loue. This sudden alteration of the Prince, in whose welfare the comfort not onely of his companions in Court, but generally of the Commons consisted, mooued them all to such exceeding griefe, that in short time theyr louely countenances were so much altered, that neyther pleasing looke, nor chearefull word, was to be obtayned fro them. The King, whose aged life depended on the happinesse of his son, as Fathers how base soeuer, delight in vertuous offprings, much more the Noble, whose honors are to bee maintained by their progeny: the aged king, whose greatest felicity was in the Prince, was with such infinit griefes oppressed, that in short time his body was so weakened, that rather hee desired to accompany the dead, then liue in such discontent, the mother Queene with ouer much care and watching neere pined, and few which felt not some part of the Princes griefe, such was their faithfull loues vnto him, whereof the Father gloried not a little, and the mother (if wome may be proud) was not a little spiced with the disease But neyther the beauties of the Father, the extreame griefe of the mother, the dayly lamenting of the Courtiers, nor the complaints of the Commons, might any way auaile the Prince, who smothering his owne sorrow, could not by all art (Physicke allowed for mens reliefe) be any way comforted. The ouer grieued burthen of whose miseries, the Queene with his kingly Father seeking to ease, and could not as he desired accomplish, such extremity likewise assayled them, that the learnedst could not iudge the difference between them, (so that by their ill) suppose the subiectes griefe, which reuerently honoured them, and could willingly haue offered their owne liues for their reliefe and ease. But in vaine striue they, that seeke helpe for him, whom none but the beautifull Nutania could release, who was the Load-starre of his life: and the loue of her, the speciall Physicke which must restore him, or die he would past all recouery, but by Nutania , that Paragon of fame, Dianaes glory, Natures only darling and delight. Weake and feeble, past recure of Physicke, became the King and Queene, voyde of hope euer to see theyr Princely sonnes recouery: wherefore, forgetting all worldly pleasure and Princely delights, such as become Princes of so high esteeme, quite abolishing all the vanities of the world, they minde wholly the euerlasting comfort, and ioy in nothing, but his death, that from death, by his bloude redeemed them. In this extremity, when all hopes were past help of men behold the mercy of him that preserueth and destroyeth at his pleasure, who mooued no doubt, at the intercession of some their vertuous subiects, or taking pitty of their distresse, as wee reade in holy writ, testimonie of our soules comfort, how Abraham beloued of God, mooued his diuine Deitie, for those Cities for sinne by iust iudgement consumed, if fiue godly people had beene found within theyr walles, they had beene preserued: so eyther for the vertues of the King, or the intercession of those sorrowing subiects, the giuer of all comfort sent them comfort, as you shall heare. The Numedian King, whose prime of youth was spent in many honorable actions, holding in great regarde the loue of his neighbour Princes, liued in such tranquilitie, that hee was honoured of all that heard of his gouernment. The report of whose long sicknesse and weake estate, moued the Kings of diuers regions, by their embassage, to comfort them, and to be aduertised of the truth of their estates. Amongst which, those honourable Princes that held his health in such regard, Thelarchus King of Thrace dispatched his Ambassadour. Who, for the more honour of their King, was accompanied with diuers Gentlemen, both of honour and great worship. These Ambassadors arriuing at the Court of Numedia their cause of comming vnknowne, many matters were of the commons supposed (who will entermeddle with Princes affaires) so that amongst them diuers things were imagined, and sundry dangers suspected, but no assurance of any, vntill their day of hearing, which the King appointed to be as suddaine as they could require. Against which time, royall preparation was made, with all the pompe could be deuised, where for feasting, there wanted no dainties, how rare soeuer, nor diuersity of Uyandes to please the appetite, with many pleasing shewes, and pastimes, the better to giue them occasion of welcome; all which, notwithstanding the Kings weakenesse, was so exquisitely performed, that it was admirable. The day of hearing come (as time stayeth not) Manpelious hauing summoned his counsell and chiefest Nobilitie, against that time to attend his pleasure: these seuerall Ambassadores were brought to his presence, where with more shewe of hartie welcome, then his weake bodie could deliuer, hee gaue them such honourable entertainment, as beseemed the messengers of such Princes, and highly contented them, whose curtesie the strangers Nobles applauded, and grieued the more at his extremity, by how much the more they saw his debility. After some talke passed between the King and these Nobles, and that hee had enquired with all kindnesse of the health of their Prince, and welfare of their countries, and receyued their Letters with diuers princely presents, they were dismissed, but yet not suffered to depart, without gracious thankes to their Kings, and kind shew of good acceptance for their paines, leauing them to their repose, with great charge to his Nobles, and those in authority, to see their entertainement such, as if their Soueraigne Lordes were present: which charge was not forgotten of those which prized their Princes honours as deare as their liues but with such pompe and cost accomplished each seuerall commaund of his Highnesse: as the Strangers might wel admire to behold it. Their diets so diuers and so aboundant as they had neuer seene the like, furnished with so much sundrie musicke, and so cunningly vsed, as might well delight the Gods. To acquaint you with other pastimes for recreation, as Playes, Maskes, Tilting, Turneying, Barriours, and other Courtly pastimes, besides, their hunting of Tygers, wilde Bores and Lyons, which mooued such delight, as other sportes pleasing vnto them. Thus in vsing dayly those pleasures, when the nobles had spent sometime in the Court, euery one content with his royall entertainement, hearing amongst the nobles of the countrey such generall honour of the Prince Dionicius , whom they had not yet seene, an speciall desire mooued them to visite the Prince, bewayling greatly that such aduerse chances, should nip so braue and honourable a Prince in the blooming time of his princely yeeres. The Prince Dionycius , albeit the imbecility of his body denied those nobles his presence at their pastimes, in which seuerall sport he much delighted, yet that they might not depart of him vnseene, he commanded a sumptuous banquet in his lodging to be ordayned: to which he inuited the stranger nobles & their companies: who wishing to see the Prince, were as glad to accompany him, as hee desirous of their company, and graciously with many humble thankes, accepted the Princes good will. The youthfull nobles attendant on the Prince, carefull to see each thing ordered, for the honour of his Maiesty, wanted nothing that might bee desired, onely expected the comming of their guests, who not vnmindfull of theyr promise, as dinner time drew nigh prepared themselues towards the Prince, vnto whom by his nobility in most gorgious manner, they were conducted: no sooner entered they his presence, but Dionicius whose curtesie was such as gained the loue of his subiects, and all strangers that had seene his demeanor: yet at this time had better knowledge how to entertaine them, then ability to performe what he would, stretching himselfe in his bed, as his weake limbes would suffer him, he gaue them such hearty welcomes, as highly contented them, and beseemed their estates. These nobles when they had made their eyes witnesses of what report had so often bruted, rather accused report of great wrong, in not giuing him such due as hee deserued, then of ouer much prayse: for that the fame bruted of him, was not to be valued with his worthinesse. The time of dinner passed they, with many glaunces on the Prince, noting his curtesie, but euer lamenting his griefe, and wishing his health, framing themselues to pleasant disourses, to put him from those melancholy thoughtes, wherewith hee was ouermuch burthened. Thus with much diuersitie of Table talke, consumed the time, the grauer sort, of matters for benefite of the state: the greener beads, whose yeeres required no other cares of theyr pleasing pastimes and pleasure, the managing theyr horses, commending the statelinesse of their bodies, their finenesse in catering their brauery in their Cornet, and excellent swiftnesse in theyr gallop, their readines in hand, and their courage in the face of the enemie: not omitting the gallant cries of their hounds, nor forgetting, by which and which such a bucke was slaine, and such a Stag pulde downe, passing not, without high comending the soring of their hawks nor forgetting their statelinesse in flight, with their fierce seazing on their game. And then for varietie, as occasion is ministred, Carowse a health to their Mistresse and Loues, in their Countrey. The Prince as louely as the best, & in his health as well able to performe whatsoeuer, had his greatest comfort in listening to the talke of Cariolus and Octauius , two noble men of Thrace , which accompanied of pleasure Atlantus , the chiefe in commission for their King, Dionicius earnestly noting these two nobles of Thrace , as most delighted with their persons and pleasant parley, heard Cariolus carowse a health to the Princesse Nutania : whose name the distressed Prince no sooner heard vttered, but the remembrance of that sweet obiect, his liues sole health, and mistresse of his fancies, so reuiued his dying spirits, that suddenly the beholders might well perceyue his wan colour, which vrged a troubled spirit, to vanish & these vermillion dyed roses, the woonted badges and ornaments of his sweete face, challenge their former intrest, and for a time possesse them, restoring vnto nature her due, making his louely countenance as cheerefull to the beholders, as the glorious Sun to the captiued, whose liberty being depriued, haue long been debarred of all worldly delights, and seldome receiued comfort from that heauenly essence. This cheereful alteration in the prince was noted of diuers, whose eares albeit busied in listening to the discourses of these strangers, yet the eyes of his own attendants, with dutifull care, gaue heede vnto the Prince. Amongst those vnto whose gouernment the care of the princes health was comitted, Barnardine , a man for his art famous, and learned in his profession (which was Phisicke) who somtime was tutor vnto him, noting this sudde chage in the Prince, supposing verily by his countenance, that some of their speeches did moue him to content, comming suddenly to him, and grasping his arme, felt his pulses beate so fiercely, as in long time they had not done the like; which made him more considerately search, to find the cause of this motion, enquire it he durst not, doubting to mooue him to melancholy, hauing so often beene denyed, but resting by him a while, continuing with his arme grasped, hee felt the pulse more and more to worke, which gaue him the more cause to finde, if he might, the originall from whence it came, and noting diligently vnto which of the company he most inclined his eyes, he might perceiue Cariolus and his Octauius earnestly busied in their former talke, which was, I dare say, neyther of religion, nor of gouernment of the State, yet was it such as Barnardine perceyued highly contented the Prince, and desired it might long continue, so it were for his Lords good. Many pretty questions passed betweene them, and much variety, in whose prattle many a fayre Lady was commended by one, and for argument as highly of the other discommended, in which humour were diuers of the Nobility of the Country, and Ladies of worth by name questioned of, and many a youthfull pranke by themselues committed, yet all in friendship, and kindly taken, though harsh frumpes passed sometimes betweene them, which moued them to much mirth. But when in earnest Octauius forgetting himselfe, falling from one matter to another, and that there should bee a iudgement giuen, who for beauty was the onely Paragon, Octauius , for affection commended Brionella , daughter and sole heire of Constantine king of Boheme , in whose fathers Court he had long been trained vp, giuing the price from their owne country Ladies: Whereat Cariolus , as if hee had beene the sworne Campion of their Land, mooued at his rash censure forgetting the reuerence of this place, tolde him flatly his iudgement was false, and that he would auow: offering his gloue in combat, to maintaine that the Princesse Nutania , & none but she, deserued the name of beautifull: whose wisedome and other good graces, in any one, was not to bee found in the circuit of the earth: and therefore Octauius , (quoth he) thou hast done ouermuch wrong, to derogate the honour due to Thracian Dames, especially our peereles Nutania , whose face if beauteous Helena liued, for whome so many thousands lost their liues, shee might well resigne that title of the one onely fayre, to her, and none but she: whose like liueth not. Octauius , who was wise and well demeaned, perceyuing this parley begun in iest, likely to end in quarrell, noting likewise, how the rest of the company ceased their serious talke to attend them, with a smiling countenance, as one not possest with chollar, brake off his talke thus. Why (my Lord) shall matter of so small moment cause friendes to iarre? What is beauty, wherof we haue so long disputed, & so highly of vs regarded? Nothing but a fading pleasure, an ornament of the face which maketh the heart proud, and draweth the mind from euery good motion, to many odious offences, whereby the honorable in committing dishonourable actions, are so blemished, that they become a common by word to the veriest drudge that Nature hath framed, Helena was fayre, and accounted the onely of her time, yet who so much scorned? Cressida beautifull, yet who more false? If beauty be attended on with such shame, as these two famous women gained, why should wee care who is beautifull? My sweet Cariolus mistake me not, if I haue passed my iudgement rashly, for neither care I whose fame in that case is esteemed or defamed, but passe them by as things of no regard, onely for argument I haue spoken more then either I regard or account of: therefore let not this be any breach of our friendship, for I protest if thou shouldst say, the white Swanne were as blacke as the rauen, the Ocean drie, and shippes floting on the maine, I would affirme it, rather then our friendship should be for such a matter discontinued. Well Octauius (quoth Cariolus ) I finde your kindnesse great, and will thanke you for it, but trust me, this gloze may not serue your turne, for as you haue spoken heresie against Beautie, and maintained a stranger before your home- borne Ladies, you shall either recant your iudgment, before our soueraigne Princesse Nutania , or receiue such penance, by your quest assigned, which I promise thee shall be all honorable Ladies. Oh my Lord (answered Octauius ) I hope I shall find your Honour more kinde, then for so small an offence to deliuer your friend prisoner at the bar, where the parties shall bee Iudges, and my Iurie such, as all lawes allow mee to appeale from, if you would: and my fault such, as if my life were in their tryall depending, I might well make my testament, and dispose of what I possesse, heartily desiring God to receiue my soule, for sure I am, my body should not long enioy breath: for no greater corrasiue can bee offered that Sex then to attribute the honor of such a prize to my one particular, they all standing on tearmes of beautie, as the Crowe which thinkes her owne birds fairest: so women how ill-faced and wrinkled soeuer they bee, may not endure to heare any commended, if happily they should heare it spoken by such as they dare not in speech displease, yet will their countenance shew their hearts discontent, by scrowling of the browes, hanging the lip, or setting a sweete face, as sugred as the gall, or by some such outward action or other, shall you find where that nipt her, for which offence looked she neuer so highly, with Bell, Booke and Candle, you shall be cursed, and neuer more come in Pater noster , how deepe soeuer you haue beene in her Creede . Hold, hold, Octauius , quoth Cariolus , too much of one thing is good for nothing: Thou hast plaide the excellent Orator. Who had thought your Ladiships experience had bin such, for theron I know you ground all your authority? Author I am sure in schooles you neuer read any which haue so highly abused that sacred Sexe, sacred I may well call them my Octauius , who are not honoured of mortall Creatures, but of the gods, and therfore in the higher account, and the more in regard, the greater thy offence, and the more grieuous thy punishment. To this pleasant discourse the whole assembly gaue eare, and were therewith greatlie delighted, yet to put them from it, and to end as pleasantly, Atlantus said: My Lord Cariolus , what is your honour become beauties Champion? Farre was it from my thought, that euer you would with such earnestnesse haue defended our fayre Ladies, but since I see you are so great an Aduocate, I will cause you to haue thankes for it at our returne, other reward I dare promise none. And you my Lord Octauius , that so clarkely haue depriued them, would I might bee your scholler, whose experience is so great, Tully, Ouid , or Marcus Aurelius , that wrote most in their disgrace, neuer writte so largely, I must needs say, as my Lord Cariolus , our Ladies are little beholding vnto you, for the danger committed is the same, the least is heresie, and how heresie is to bee punished your honor knoweth: yet my Lord, as I would gladly become a peacemaker, and that friendes may not growe at ods, whereby any danger might happen to your person, albeit the offence bee not pardonable, yet the faulte mede in a forraine Countrey ought there to haue his triall. If it shall stand with your good liking, no ladies present to heare your hard censure, your fauor may be the more: & since I haue by patiece of this honorable company, intruded my selfe to speak in our Ladies cause, not being a feed Counceller for them, I will intreat this Noble Gentleman to giue me leaue, & let me censure of the same, so it strand with your Lordships good pleasure. Now truely quoth Octauius , I finde your Lordshippes kind, and more kinde then I can desire or deserue, when I shall neede your fauour in matter of more import, I will make bolde, till when, I put you downe with Cariolus for one of my small friends, for this matter I shall need small friendship, vnlesse to bring your cause to better effect, you doe as many craftie people now a dayes vse, to make small conscience, in selling mens soules to the Diuell for money, to sweare what hee shall commaund them, how false soeuer to the impouerishing of many, whose good hospitalitie, and other good neighbourhood, was more then euer such base villaines could reach vnto, if such a Companion you mate me with, or search out some subtill Lawyer, that can by his quirkes and quiddities in Law, make a bad matter good, and annointing the Iudge with vnguentum aurum , cause him to incline to the same, my cake is dough, if by such subordinations, for swearing and false iudgement, my speech be wrested to your aduantage. Cease my Octauius , this dread heauens forfend, for this offence thy punishment should bee as thou deseruest, much lesse that any sinister meanes should be vsed to bring thee to open penance: yet good Octauius let mee intreate thee, as in this assembly thou hast vniustly giuen the prize of beauty to Brionella , and therein hast wronged highly the onely of the world, by thy partiall iudgement, in derogating from her the Title of most excellent, which is most Honourable, and no more than her worth requireth: confesse but thy fault and errour in the same, and an end, if thou louest thy owne good, refuse not this offer, lest worse befall thee then Acteon or to Paris for his rash iudgement. Thou hast learned vs in thine owne Exordium , that Women are inspired with minds of reuenge. Bee therfore by thy friendes entreated, before the punishment come vpon thee, so mayest thou keep thee from much sorrow, for if no greater mischiefe fall vpon thee, thou shalt be sure of more curses, then thy weake carkasse can beare: for my Octauius , in friendship I say this, & warne thee as one that loueth thee, knowing their inclinations, which as thy selfe confesseth, is bent to reuenge: if so as many as shall heare of this blasphemy, if they doe thee no other ill, their cursing thou shalt be sure of, and womens cursings are as bad as the curse of holy Saint Gillian , which is sayd to be ten times worse then the Diuels. Treason, treason, my Lords, qd. Octauius , if I haue spoken heresie, this questionlesse is no better then treason, and the comparison so odious as may not bee endured, (the diuell and a woman ioyned in one) as fit a match as may be made. Well, my Lord, since in my errour I haue found you kind in fauouring my fault, let vs doe as all bribing officers vse, beare with me, and ile hold with thee: so by concealing my fault, the lesse dangers shall happen vnto you, if you refuse my kind offer, I come vpon you with an old Prouerbe, (ka me) (ka thee) or as children play, (tell of mee, ile tell of thee.) Well watcht my Lord Octauius , quoth the whole company, but my Lords, let the further hearing of this matter rest, till better opportunity, least your tediousnesse breed trouble to my Lord the Prince, whose quiet I wold not willingly offend. My honourable Lords answered the Prince, these discourses of those noble men be pleasing to your honours, assure you, they are no way offensiue vnto me, I haue troubled you from your better cheare, to accept of a sicke mans pittance, whereunto you are so heartily welcome, as to your owne Pallaces, (and welcome) sayth our Country Housholders, is the best dish, at their feasts: if therefore my Lords you accept my welcome, I am the more honoured by you, which haue so gratiously vouchsafed me your Companies. Then turning to the Lord Cariolus , he sayd, for you my good Lord, how much I acknowledge my selfe indebted to you, I omit, and yeeld you as many thousand thankes for your pleasing speech, as there were sillibles in your Words: you haue like your selfe defended the weaker sexe, for the which, were I the Princes Nutania , your challence made in my cause, should be bountifully rewarded: I am sorry my good Lord, my bad hap was such, that I knew you no sooner. But if it shall stand with your Lordships pleasure, that during the time of your abode here, to vouchsafe me your company, so it may be no disparagement to your serious affayrs: perswade your selfe, your welcome shall be no better in any place, then vnto me, for which kindnesse, you shall bind mee vnto your friendship. Gracious Prince answered the Noble Cariolus , thankes for your Princely fauour, and gracing mee thus, which am not any way to do your Maiestie seruice, but wherein your highnesse shall commaund, I shall be readie with all dutifulnes to accomplish. Leaue these speech, good my Lord, quoth the Prince, and offering duety where friendship is requested, and graunting my sute, let me enioy thy companie, so shalt thou commaund Dionicius for euer as a friend. The grauer sort of those Noble strangers, whome matters of more importance called away, after humble thanks giuen for their royall entertainement, wishing health, and all happinesse vnto his Excellence, they commit him to his rest. Barnardine , which had endured the end of all these prattles, and perceiuing that this talke was altogether friuolous, and not worthy the hearing, mooued him to delight: he beganne diligentlie to enter into each particular discourse of Cariolus and Octauius , and considerately to note each seuerall passion of the Prince: so farre searched this skilfull Physition into euery particular, that canuasing it throughly, hee noted his speciall iesture, and how his colour came (and vanished) yea, how much his heart was possessed with ioy, when he heard the Princesse Nutania named: the working of his pulces, made Barnardine imagine the cause of his disease, yet had no assurance thereof, and to enquire it of the Prince was in vaine, for that hee had so often denied the same: wherefore hee concealing his thoughts, in hope to worke meanes for his recouerie, and finding those cinders which were like to consume him, (and the rather) if hee could procure Cariolus to accompany him. Thus leauing the Prince to his quiet; and Barnardine to his care, for recouering his health, returne wee to the aged weake King. The King whose long sicknese, and care of his wife and sonnes health, whome hee loued most zealously, being extreamely vexed, and greatly weakened of his body, when Physicke had done what was possible, and small hope to recouer him, in the midst of his passions when all hopes was past, but onely the comfort of him who by his word rayseth the dead from the graue, so this ( Mampelius ) receiued comfort by his kingly neighbours friends, whose letters when hee had by his Councell perused, aud with regard and aduise, noted each kinde offer, with their perswading reasons, (albeit) hee could hardly digest the same: yet considering how fraile men are, and that our cares of Terraine ioyes, are to be fastened to that Celestiall commander, which releeueth all those that seeke him, hee reuiued himselfe, and like a faithfull Souldier, taking hold of the promise in holy write so often repeated, hee cast care of wife, childe, and kingdome, vpon him, that first gaue it him, and by whose prouidence hee so long enioyed them: taking his chiefest care to gratifie those his friends, by whose counsell hee was vrged to the heauenly comfort. And those honourable Nobles for their paines, who wishing to be with their friends in their owne Countreyes, attend his Highnesse pleasure, for answere: which hee tooke order should with such speede be dispatched, as possible might any way be vsed. Dionicius , whose heart was on his blasphemie, vowing his loue wholly to the Princesse Nutania , who so delighted in recounting her praise, as nothing could be so pleasing, but as all sorts of men infected with that agonie (if their loue bee faithfull) are enclined to some iealousie, so this monstrous Basalicke, whose poyson infecteth the vaines, and consumeth the heart, without wisedome gouerne the minde, as by this Prince notably appeared: who in his idle thoughts, calling to minde the praises of Cariolus , and the challenge made in defence of the Princesse Nutania , as loue endureth no arriual, so Dionicius striken with the sting of iealousie, began to conceiue many vnhonourable thoughts of Cariolus supposing Nutania was his Loue, and that by Cariolus his ioyes in her loue, and hope of fauour, should bee frustrate and of no account: with much matter more, then euer was by Cariolus imagined, how largely soeuer his speech was vsed in the Princesse behalfe, to procure their delights, and mooue Octauius to chollor: notwithstanding no reason might perswade, where iealousie had giuen iudgement, for the Prince in this iealousie, sought no meane, but reuenge of him that neuer committed the least thought of euill against him. When reuenge in this Princes heart was thus imprinted, and rage and iealousie set downe his death, an honourable motion, more befitting his grace then rigor, mooued by the inspiration of the eternall God, withdraw him from this base attempt, hee called to minde, the honour of his house, the loue of those Princes, their bordering neighbors, by whose commaund, Cariolus came into his Country, the Scandall so bloodie a fact deserued, and what continuall ignomie would redowne vnto him and his progenie for euer: accusing himselfe of great impietie, he exclaimed on his follies in this manner. Blush Dionicius , at thy base thoughts, and so much sorrow for thy pretended mischiefe, against this noble straunger, as if thou hadst shed blood of a thousand innocentes hast thou from thy Cradle disdained to offer wrong to the most inferiour, and wilt now begin with murther of a noble man? Knowest thou not, that to adde to his head one haire, is more then the greatest Prince can doe? And wilt thou seeke his life that neuer had thought of ill against thee? Hath thy father liued so many yeares honourably reputed amongst them, euer in tranquilitie, and by thy cruel slaughtering thy friend, shall their peace be broken? Was it not for his comfort and thy good, these strangers came into this countrie? and for their kindnesse, canst thou reward them with such despight? Thou enuiest the happinesse of a toward Gentleman, for thou knowest not what, (say he loued the Princesse) what is that to thee, interest hast thou none, to debarre him from it. Nurania , thou knowest not but by hearesay, he a nobleman of her Country, a toward Gentleman, and worthily may obtaine her: nature hath made him of the moulde of the earth, whereof thou art framed, the begger is as subiect to amorous passions as the Prince. Nutania is beautifull, wise, fayre, and in the principall time of her flourishing estate, louely as the dewe on the sweete Roses. Cariolus valiant, well featured, wise and towarde, in all honourable actions, all which are loade-starres to draw Ladies to loue: and Nutania is but a woman thogh a Princesse. If then thou hast neither feare of God, or lawe of humanitie to perswade thee from so great a mischiefe, yet let his kindnesse offered thee, which hath beene as much as euer thou requirest, bee of of some regard. The fiercest beasts seldome harme those, whose society they vse, and wilt thou be found more cruell then vnreasonable creatures: No, no Dionicius , let die thy malice to Cariolus , who is innocent and farre from any thought of pretended euill against thee, for so much the more shall his blood with extremity bee reuenged, by how much the more, thou vniustly iniuriest him, yea, rather chuse to die a thousand deaths, if euery life were a Legion of liues, then hold so base a minde. Thou hast long (though to thy great griefe) and much sorrowe concealed shy loue to Nutania , and now wilt thou murther him that wisheth thee well: for her loue. No, no, Dionicius , let honor be the marke whereat thou aymest, account death more precious then life with ignominie, honour by murther blemished, is such a staine as can neuer be raced out, but the continuall ignominie thereof, will remaine while there is any being: Yea, and what is more to be regarded, the welfare of thy subiects on whom the blood of so noble a man will be with great effusion reuenged, and thy countrie like those ruinous monuments of Troy laid wast and desolate, which was spoyled for a fact nothing so odious. Sithence thou hast all these reasons to reduce thee from this vile thought, dally no longer with thy shadow, as in the tale of Aesope thou maiest read, of the dog; who mooued with enuie, of anothers welfare, not onely hazarded his life, but what else he had in possession. Though the comparison be ridiculous, yet the example may mooue thee to feare thine owne fall. For if the Goddes be so iust in punishing such offences in vnreasonable creatures, how much more shalt thou be plagued, whom God hath not onely endued with reason, but inuested with titles of Maiestie and honour; whose life should shine on the earth, as the glorious Sun, and by thy vertues draw such as liue vnder thy gouernment, from their desire to commit euill; for such as is the Pastor, such will be the flocke: if the Prince be vertuous, the Subiect will feare to offend, if he be vicious, who will care to liue in obedience of him, or his lawes. Thou seest Dionicius , ye perill, surcease therfore thy base thoughts (and as Cariolus is Noble,) where thou hast without desert bene iealous, become iealous from enuying him, that no way wished thee euill; admit him to thy friendship, to him thy kindnesse may be acceptable, and in vsing such fauours, maist thou in time learne the truth of what thou now supposest. If Cariolus loue Nutania he cannot be so secret, but in some sort or other, thou shalt attaine to the knowledge thereof: and as thou shalt in conuersing with him, finde his Honourable dealings, so maist thou either trust him or refuse him: If Nutania haue vowed her loue vnto him, seeke to maister thy affection, and wish them ioy, if not, his friendship may the sooner bring thee to thy desires, by acquainting the Princesse with thy loue, in explaining the passions for her thou hast indured. Nutania (saith the worlds report) is beautifull, wise, and honorably demeaned, and therefore cannot be cruell: her father a king beloued of all that haue heard of him, whose kindnesse hath beene such to thy father and thee, as thou canst not deserue: if such loue remaine in the parents, the children should not hate: then fondling, if thou hast wronged thy selfe in concealing thy griefe, accuse thy owne follies: & condemne not thy friends of euill, nor let thy iealousie blame Cariolus who neuer had thought of preteded euill against thee: if thou faile in thy loue, blame none but thy selfe, spare to speake, spare to speed, Cowards neuer were Loues champios, nor faint hearted swads obtained Ladies loue: wome though neuer so base, will be sued, sought after, & courted with manie deuises allured to win them, and their loues obtained, as sundry meanes sought to continue it. A Nouice art thou Dionicius , and neuer came to know what many a hardie man at armes hath endured, histories are diuers, which shew the extreames of Princes and famous conquerors, that they endured through loue, yet hast thou neuer read of any that euer wooed by silence, courted their mistresses with imaginations, or obtained their loue being mute: Longer maist thou smother thy griefe, which may cureles consume thee: fire suppressed burneth wt more vehemencie, and loue concealed consumeth the intrals and slayeth remedilesse. How long may thy shoo wring thy foot, before any that looke thee in the face can tell where it pincheth thee. Many of meane birth haue obtained the loue of Princes, & Ladies of great worth, & by daring to attempt wedded and bedded them. If the ignoble haue had such successe in loue, Rouze thee dastard from this loathsome cabinet, arme thee with hopes of thy Mistresse fauour, & with courage seeke to obtaine it: let griefe no longer oppresse thee but like the sonne of thy renowned Father, shew thy self: let not daring loue, which by many good motions may be vanquished, ouerthrow thee by subiecting thy selfe ouer much vnto it, but in the face of the enemie shewe thy selfe, and there by prowesse purchase such renowne, as the report of thy valour may gayne thee the loue of her thou most desirest. Womens loues for the most part are setled on the valiant, & such as aduenture, holding in regard suck as by their valour, can and will maintaine their honours, bearing in triumph their fauours in the field, and gayning honour in their titles. I, thus Dionicius should be thy thoughts, hold, thee there, and no doubt of good successe: Nutania is but a woman though a Princesse, thou sonne to a King, and no way her inferiour. Then continue this resolution, and Nutania may in time, aswell seeke thy fauour, as the noble Amozonia, Alexanders loue. How Cariolus one of the Nobles of Thrace, comming to take his leaue of the Prinee Dionicius, playing a game at Chests, vnto whom Cariolus giuing the Matte, the Prince Dionicius, on the sudden strooke him with the chest-borde, and what then followed. Scantly had hee ended this tedious premeditation, when word was brought vnto him by one of his Pages, that the Lord Cariolus was come to visit him, which did put him from all further imaginations at that time. Cariolus no sooner come to his presence, but Dionicius with a blushing countenance bad him welcome, ashamed of his rash suspition, yet concealing the same as hee might, framed such kinde speech as he best could, the better to assure his welcome, not sparing oftentimes to render great and hearty thanks for his kindnesse in comming to visite him: and more to shew how glad hee was of his compayy, he called to rise, which he had not done long before, but for necessitie of making his bed. Thus when long time was spent betweene them, discoursing of many matters, to both their contents, Dionicius called for meate, where to accompany Cariolus , he receyued more sustenauce than he had in many daies before, to the great ioy of his attendant Bernardine , who by messengers certified the King and Queene thereof, who ioyed and were not a little comforted at this report. Dinner ended, and Cariolus with the Prince deuising to beguile the time, loath suddenly to leaue him, called for a Chesse boord, wherewith they sported a while, Dionicius whom griefe of mind procured soone to melancholy, losing two or three fayre games, became very impatient, to agrauate whose chollor, and make his fury the more. Cariolus playing for cunning, to make game, tooke his Queene, and gaue checke to his King, whereat the Prince forgetting both himselfe, and other those motions so lately by him minded, first violently striking him with the boarde, ranne fiercely on him, and taking him by the throat, cryed mainely out thus: Uillaine, quoth hee, shamest thou not to robbe me of my Lady, my Loue, my life, and soules comfort, but to my teeth must checke me therewith in my owne Country. (Base fugitiue) thou shalt beard me no more therwith for by thy miserable death, will I recouer to mine owne possession, my Loue, my Lady, my Queene, yea, in despight of thy head, Nutania shall be my Mistresse, sweet Princesse, the onely soueraigne of my thoughts. Bernardine , and his Noble attendants, seing this friendship lately profest, so suddenly forgotten, taking him with much adoe from Cariolus , were not a little perplexed, but as men past themselues, hauing neuer seene the like, could imagine no cause, greatly doubting, that soddenlie hee was growne lunaticke. Cariolus vexed at this hard vsage of the Prince, was no sooner freede from him, but in great choller would haue departed. Protesting to bee reuenged for this discurtesie offered him. Affirming that his intising speeches, in colour of kindnesse, was to no end, but to draw hm from his honourable friends to murther him. Barnardine carefull what might ensue hereof, weighing each occasion which might hereat be taken, besought Cariolus of that loue he bare the king his Master, which had vsed them honourably, of his loue to his owne king, and all that might bee imagined, to conceyue of this wrong offered, as of no such pretended matter, as he supposed: but rather with patience to consider the long extreme sicknes of the Prince, and how subiect by reason of his infirmitie hee was vnto melancholy, vndertaking on his faith and honest reputation, how euer the occasion grew, it was not in malice: assuring him, the Prince when hee should call to minde this vnkind action, would with griefe lament it, and sorrowing for the same, submit himselfe, crauing hearty forgiuenes for his rashnes. Bernardine vexed at the heart for these vnkind dealinges of the Prince, entreating his associates to perswade Cariolus , went himselfe to the Prince, and after dutiful speech to his grace; recounted vnto him, in what euill part Cariolus tooke his abuse by him offered: humbly beseeching him, as he esteemed the loue of his Princely Father, & the honor and reputation of his Country, to acknowledge in som curteous maner the wrong committed, & to reconcile himselfe. Dionicius , whose passion had not yet left him, albeit in his health none might more perswade him then Barnardine , yet hearing him preach repentance, being in this humour, forgate theyr passed friendship, and moued with his talke, albeit it was vsed for his good, with a looke as gastly, as a ghoast risen from the graue, drewe neare Barnardine , and laying hands on him, had like to haue mischieued him, had he not made the more speede away. Cariolus vnderstanding what had beene offered the aged man, and hearing in what regard the Prince held his loue, passing by his choller, began with great heauinesse to lament the prince his agony, and sorrowing for him, besought the heauens creature so to comfort the Prince, as himselfe would wish in the like extreme. And so leauing Barnardine and the Nobles to their charge, departed. The Nobles whose griefe was not little, with heartes ouercharged with sorrow, thinking it not conuenient to leaue him alone, doubting some worse matter should happen vnto him went to visite the Prince cheerefully, enquiring of his welfare, which with so good countenances as he could vse, was kindly answered of the Prince: who hauing past the extremity of his fury, calling to mind those notable abuses offered his friends, greatly lamenting his folly therin, he sayd. How the Prince Dionicius calling to minde the wrong offered the Lord Cariolus, sorowed for it, accusing him selfe of great ingratitude for the same, in dishonoring his state and Countrey. The Nobles are entreated honorably, and with rich gifts depart: Dionicius recouering in short time some strength, and doth abandon his sicke lodging. Where , where, my honourable friendes, may I hide my head, to shelter me from the worlds reproach, who voyde of al reason, more brutish then the sauage beast, haue sought to murthering dearest friends. Oh, how might I blushe with shame, and ashamed of my euill commited, neuer behold the faces of those whom I haue so euill entreated, what fury bewitched me to this mischiefe: Or what dluelish sorcerie enchaunted my spirits, and captiuated my sences, so to offend thee Lord Cariolus: who of thy zealous affection and courtesie came to visite me, deiighting so greatly in thy company, as I did. And thou the Father of grauity, my greatest hope in the world, Barnardine , thou whose honest care and loue to mee hath beene euer showne from my Cradle. Oh Barnardine , how vngratefull haue I beene, rewarding thy good with the hazard of thy bloud: Woe is me vnhappy, and thrice vnhappy, that I haue liued to behold the light of this day, wherein past my selfe, I haue so highly offended. Pardon, pardon, my Lord Cariolus , as thou art honorable and thou Barnardine , whose aged yeares I haue so highly offended: Forgiue my misse, and remit that euill I haue committed against thee, or let mee neuer behold the dayes light againe. Why should I liue, whom mine owne conscience so highly accuseth of such impiety. Will not the fowles of the ayre, so aring ouer thy head as thou walkest, crie out, (vngratefull Dionicius ) thou wouldest haue murthered thy friendes: each creature that God hath made, wil exclaime against thee for this euill, following thee with cryes of horror, to thy euerlasting reproach. Therefore vnhappy Dionicius , since by thy owne doings this reproach is hapned vnto thee, whereby for euer thou art dishoneured, and no man hereafter will dare to vse any familiaritie with thee, no, not one, from the Prince to the Begger (liue not, liue not thou Dionicius ,) but let that hand that committed the euill, finish thy life, which liuing, can neuer bee vnremembred. In this fury, resoluing to haue mischiefe fed himselfe, his Nobles taking him in their Armes with such comfortable speeches as they could, pacified him, who seeing his sorrowfulnesse, were partakers of his griefe, and much lamented his extremity, as men might for their Soueraigne: yet casting of care, seeking the best for their quiet they could, they layde him in his bed, where, with solemne musicke they procured him to sleepe, Where for a time I leaue him. Time that findeth all things, hath now wrought an end of the kings affaires, for the dispatch of the Ambassadors, whom the King with great entertainment and Iewals of high estate, so rewarded, as they had all cause to speake of his royall bounty. The Ambassadors receyuing their Letters, and the time appointed for their departure, their ships with victuals at the Kings cost replenished, and all other necessaries, Cariolus who had often beene solicited by Barnardine to visite the Prince, and by his report, whose word was of account with all that had knowledge of his simple dealings, was perswaded of the Princesse sorrow, for the wrong offered him. Wherefore that it might appeare vnto Dionisius , he departed not in displeasure, but that hee had forgotten all wrongs offered, kindly, before his departure came to take his leaue. Where vpon the courteous demeanour of the Prince, who manifested his griefe by the abundance of sighes which he powred foorth, they were reconciled, and an inuiolable league of friendship vowed betweene them, which with solemne oathes they protested, should neuer quaile in eyther of them. The hast of the noble Ambassadors, who desired to bee with theyr loues at home, is more now then Cariolus wished: But what must be, shall be, how loth soeuer. Wherefore after many friendly gratulations betweene them, and great gifts of the Prince, on his new ( Amico ) bestowed, they take leaue each of other, Cariolus solemnely praying for the Princesse health, and Dionisius wishing them all happinesse. Thus all things fitted by the Kinges command, they were honourably conducted vnto the Porte, where theyr shippes ready furnished attended their comming: where they had not long stayed, but a fayre winde to serue their turnes, God sent them, and they embarqued themselues, each one for his seuerail country, and the Nobles returned to the Court: where to their carefull regarde of their king, Countries benefite, wee leaue them, to let you knowe further of the Prince, who is troubled as you shall heare. The Prince, whom Nature had formed so exquisite in lineaments of body, as could bee required, hauing Wisedome and Ualour inferiour to none, when hee had considered with great Wisedome from point to point, the extremitie of his estate, and found that his disease was so grieuous and so great, that he rather desired death then life, in that agonie to be continued, weighing all dangers which might befall him, in seeking secretly for such helpe, as by his own industrie hee could procure: with the pleasures and heartes content, the obtayning of his loues delight, would bring him, resolutely determined, as much as he might, to cherish himselfe: and disguising himselfe in habite of a Traueller, vnknowne of any man; so soone as his strength would permit him, hee departed his Countrey towardes Thrace , and eyther gayne his Lady, or trie in short time the sicklenesse of his Fortune: hazarding all on this rest, he secretly procureth all his iewels, and such summes of money as he could: and by little and little recouering himselfe, vsed his wonted familarity amongst the Nobles, and Courtiers, which did cause no small content and heartes ioy in the King and Queene, and Commons, yea, such was the generall reioycing of the whole people in the Realme for his recouery, that there was not one, which shewed not some signe of gladnesse, by his outward appearance. How Dionicius recouering health, sought opportunity to leaue the Court, his Kingly Father and Mother, to see the Thracian Court, which suddenly hee obtayned, what hapned him in his iourney. As there is not the clearest day which is not ouerwhelmed with some cloude, so lasted this ioy amongest these louing Subiects not long: for Dionicius continuing his determination, conueyed his summes of money and Iewels into a groue within the Parke, neare the Court, at such seuerall times (onely to effect his pretended purpose) as he would chuse to be solitary, wrought so close, ond with such disceetion, that he was altogether vnperceyued of any man. Each thing wrought to his content, secrecly in the euening, his companions by him appointed to keep the Courtiers from idlenesse, by such pastimes as hee had deuised, as Masking, Barriors, Dieing, and other recreations, whom he refused to accompany, alleadging that hee might not bee long absent from the King, and that his sporte determined, was to recreate the Queene, who since her sicknesse was very melancholy, which coyned excuse passed for currant as what was it they would not credit which hee should report. Hauing thus politikely fitted all thinges, Supper ended and euery one attending the beginning of the sportes and pastimes, Dionicius who had more stringes ts his Harpe then one, had no care but how to conuey himselfe from their presence, which hee tooke opportunity to doe, telling the Queene mother hee had giuen his word to be one of the Maskers, which shee beeing glad of, as reioycing to remooue hie melancholy by any meanes, suffered him to depart. But too soone alas, gaue shee credite to his fayned speeches, which turned them all to great sorrow and heauinesse: for Dionicius minding least what they supposed hee most ioyed in, conueyed himselfe with all the hast he possibly could into the Parke, where his footeman attended his comming with his Horse, on which hee was no sooner mounted, to driue in suspition or iealous thoughtes of his late trauell from his man, hee commaunded him presently to speede with all the haste hee might, vnto the house of a Knight dwelling not farre off, with a deuised message, pretending the businesse to bee of great weight and importance, and straightly charging him not to depart from thence before his comming, which should bee the next night. With this commaundement the seruant departed, least suspecting the losse of so bountifull a maister was so neere. But the Prince whose chiefe content was in beholding the Idia of that Paragon, whom Fame had so extolled, had his heart fiered with desire, that hee thought euery day a yeare, and euery minute a moneth, vntill hee behelde the Excellencie of Natures worke, the onely performed worke of beauty, and the Soueraigne goddesse of his thoughts: of which Dionicius hauing no small regard, doubting to be missed of the King, and loth to loose that opportunity, pasteth with all speede vnto the Groue where his coyne and Iewels lay, where, the better to escape the suspition of Officers in his passage, crossing the seas, he attired himselfe in the habite of a Merchant, which he had redy prouided for that purpose: and so making small stay, hee ceaseth not his coriours pace, nor spareth any Horseflesh, vntil he came to the Port where hee pretended to imbarke himselfe. No sooner arriued he at that so long desired place, but fortune who had bent his thoughts to trauel, entending after her many crosses to sawce his sowre with some sweet, and like a comfortable Physition, after many bitter pilles ministred for cloying the stomacke of his Patient, comforteth him with some conserue, or other more pleasing his appetite: so the Prince now in the beginning of his Fortunes, found this fauour, to arme him with the better hope of ensuing good: for at his first comming to the City, after enquirie made for some shippe bound for Thrace , hee had intelligence of a Barke already haled out of the Harborough, into the roade, her yards crossed, and her Mariners expecting the comming abroad of the master and her Marchants and so to depart. Which newes how pleasing it was to the Prince, suppose you gentiles that haue your hearts so full fraught with desire of this noble Dionicius , who no sooner was informed hereof, but diligently went himselfe to search the Maister and and Marchants of this shippe, whome he found in an Ostria , carrowsing healthes to their good voiage and taking leaue of their friends in the City, to whose company the Prince being com, albeit nothing acquainted with the conditions of those people, yet he so framed his behauior to his habit, that it might haue beene admired amongst the Courtiers, his quaint behauiour, had they been beholders thereof, pleasing so well these humorous companions with his carowsing, curtesie, and bountifull expences, that nothing hee could require was denied him. A wonder it were to tell you, whe he required passage, with what willingnes they graunted it, and what large proffers were made him of their Cabbins, and other sea curteues al which hee accepted with such kindnesse, and none more welcome than Dionicius , who standing on thornes to bee cleare of his land, whome loue enforceth without regarde of Father, Crowne or Subiects, to leaue, hee hastnesh the rest aboord: of whose company the Mariners were not a little ioyful, for that the wind serued them in such pleasant manner to bring them to their desired hauen, whither (following the Maysters direction for their course, sayling with a fayre gale, we leaue them for a time, to tell you of the greefe of Mampelius the Numedian King, for the losse of his sonne, of whome no manner of newes might be heard. You haue heard Gentiles, with what policie the Prince wrought, the better to bring his purposed intent to passe, and what seuerall pastimes were by him deuised: in which seuerall actions, it was supposed by the Courtiers, himselfe would haue beene a chiefe, or at least a beholder of theyr sportes. But he which had more hammers working in his braines then one, taking the time as fittest for his opportunity, gaue them a cause of great sorrow, as you shall heare. Whose sportes ended, and euery thing with great credite to the Actors, and pleasure to the beholders finished, the King and Queene, whom age now called to rest, after kind countenances, and many thankes to the Noblemen and Gentiles, bad them good night, who were in all humblenes and hearty loues commended to their rests, where let them rest, vntill the newes of their sonnes departure be brought them, by the wofull Barnardine , whose heart surcharged with sorrow, could hardly bee comforted, but that through the extremity of his griefe, hee had resigned his latest gaspe to him who first gaue him breath. How the Prince Dionicius departing so sudenly from the Court, caused the haynous & great sorrow of the king and all his Subiects, which hee he wayleth in this wofull manner. This wofull newes was two whole dayes and more kept from the king, by that mirrour of fidelitie Barnardine , who by all meanes art or trauell could imagine, enquired after the Prince, but of him could heare no tidings, whereby many supposed he was slaine: some coniecturee one thing, some another. But most of all the King and Queene, their happinesse was such as may not without great effusion of teares bee remembred, which caused a generall griefe throughout the whole Regiment. But neyther sorrow of the Subiects nor lamentation of their King, might recall him whom they all so much desired to see, which caused the King ouercharged with melancholy, rather desiring death then life, breath out these speeches. Unhappy ( Manpelius ) and more vnhappy, in being father to so graselesse a childe, (oh Dionicius ) why haue I liued to see thee growne a man, tenderly caring to bring thee to that estate, & now my chiefest hope was in thee to haue comfort, thus by thy vnkind demeanour, to cause my griefe: how happy bee those parents whose children liue in obedience, but thrice accursed those fathers which giueth the bridle of youth into their hands, who ought to be held in, as the Colt vntamed with the hardest bit, Though wisedome presageth lawes of gouernment to Fathers, and experience of the Auncient which haue liued in older times giueth aduise, cryeth out of such as giueth liberty to yonglinges, yet law of nature whereunto wee vnhappy parents are too much tyed, forgetting all counsels, are so besotted on those carelesse yonglings, that if they desire any thing, whether it be profitable for their instruction, or haleth them to destruction, it may not bee denied them, how many of high estate by the carelesse regard of their vntoward children, haue beene brought to great heauinesse: Or who taking pleasure in his ofspring, can see him restrayned, (I, but vnhappy man) hast thou not heard the learned Surgeon often tell his tender Patient, that it is better to smart once, then endure griefe euer. And thou that mightest haue kepte thy deare Sonne vnder his Tutors custodie, wherein hee liued in obedience, might so haue had him still, if thy owne foolishnesse had not beene so carelesse of him. Then since thou hast been the cause of thine own sorrow, blame thy selfe, and sigh to thinke on thy follies: & as thou hast beene the originall of this mischiefe, not onely robbing thy Countrey of a toward braunch to succeede thee, but hast left to thy selfe the ioy of a Father, in wanting thy sonne, thy lifes sole happinesse. Perswade thee, that as many countries haue beene punished for the Princes offences, so this plague is layde vpon thy Subiects for thy misse. Wherefore in sorrowing for thy sinnes, and that God may shew his mercy vpon thy kind Countreymen, sorrow for thy sopperie, and abiuring thy selfe from Kingdome, Wife, and Countrey, betake thee to some vnknowne place, where thou mayest spend the remainder of thy ouerworne yeeres, in contemplation of thy sinnes, so may that God of all mercy which neuer turneth his face from the penitent, receiue thee to his grace, and restore thy sonne, calling him from his youthfull desires, to become a comfort vnto those which with many salt teares, and hearts full gored with sorrow, bewayle his absence. Thus powring foorth his griefe with sighes, and many brinish teares, vttering his sorrowe, he resolued to leaue all his earthly possessions, and altogether forsaking the company of all mankinde, liue solitary in some vnfrequented place, vntill it would please God some tidinges should bee sent him of his sonne, or else by death call him to those ioyes which neuer shall haue ende. Thus for this time hee ended his sorrowfull speech, vttered in great griefe of minde, whome carefull for to espie time & opportunitie fit for his departure, wee leaue him for a time And shall tell you further of the Prince Dionisius , who long before this time is arriued in Thrace . How Dionicius Prince of Numedia, arriued at the Court of Thrace, in habit of a Marchant, employing his stocke in Marchandize. Suddenly after, the Emperours Sonne Mustapha Corienia, with a great force, both by land and sea, commaunded the Countrey of Thrace, for that the Princes Nutania was denied him in mariage, whereof he fought reuenge. The Prince whome desire led to gaine the loue of Nutania , not otherwise knowne but for a Marchant, landed now in safety, after a friendly welcome giuen to his fellowe Passengers, the Master and Owners, with bountifull rewardes bestowed on the Mariners, was lodged by the Maister in a Marchants house of great reputation, where vnknowne to bee any other then hee seemed, hee imployed his stocke by Brokers to great benefite, which bountifully hee spent, whereby hee gayned the loue of all men that euer had any acquaintance with him, so that in short time his Fame was so bruted throughout the City, that none of any account, but tooke great pleasure in his Company, and ioyed to recount his many vertues. This amorous Prince whose heart was on his halfepenny, loath to acquaint any man with his secret loue to the Princesse, doubting some further perill to his person then hee was willing to hazard, would oftentimes intrude himselfe into the company of young Courtiers, amongst whom he so demeaned himselfe, and so courtly in all things, that all men might iudge from what Tree such branches sprung. By this often frequenting of the Court, in the company of those, to whome hee was most welcome, hee attayned the sight of his Lady, whose beauty when he had seene so amazed him, that if hee were before passionate, hee was now more perplexed, iudging her excellent perfections to be without copare, yet not knowing how to make knowne his loue vnto her, smothering in silence his affection, he dayly desired some occasion might bee offered, wherin for her safety, and honour of his beloued, hee might shew some act worthy honour, and to deserue her liking, which by Fortunes assistaunce thus happilie come to passe. Mustopha Corienia , youngest sonne to Sutton Corienia , Emperour of Constantinople , burning in loue of this Princesse, onely by the rare report of her singular perfection, had by Ambassadors from his Father, craued the Princesse in marriage, who disdayning his loue being a Pagan (although honourable) might not be wonne by any intreaty to fancie him, how great soeuer his offers and protestations of loue were: which refusall, the Prince brooked so ill, beeing of such might, that determining to gaine her by force for his concubine, which in friendship he had so often required to marry, hee leuied a power of one hundred thousand, both on horse and foote, and shipping them in warlike maner, in Gallies, Frigarts, Foysts, and Brigandioces, he arriued by the hard labour & painfull bowging of his slaues, before the Citie of Lemonia , where Philarchus kept his Court, landing the greatest part of his men & horse suddenly, and beleagared the same, both by land and sea: vnto which hee gaue many fierce and hote assaults, & were as valiantly resisted by the courage of those gallant Cittizens, who fighting in right of their Country, feared not the hugenesse of their Armies, nor their force of shipping: yet as the extremes of forrain force causeth many troubles, so did the Army of Mustapha driue these braue Thrarians to many wants, whose courage through the lacke of victualls began to quaile, that hauing no meane of reliefe, neyther by sea nor land, loth to famish, came dayly to the Court humbly beseeching the King to take pitty of them, and not with famine to suffer them die. But considering that the Princesse was the marke whereat hee aymed, would rather deliuer her, who should be honourably intreated, then suffer so many thousands to perish. Philarchus vexed in mind, was driuen to a non plus , so diuersly perplexed, he could not suddenly answere, his childe who was his onely comfort and heyre, eyther to be deliuered him, whose name was odious vnto him, or his subiects who loued him no lesse then their owne soules, must perish in this extreame. Thus doubtfull what to answere, hee craued respite for two dayes, which they willingly yeelded vnto, albeit their want of victuals was so great they might hardly endure. The report of this dolefull sute of the Commons comming to the eares of Dionicius , who with his attire, wee change to Pheander , who was not a little mooued there, and the greater was his heauinesse, by how much the more his loue was encreased towards the Princesse, for whose relief he sought many deuises, eftsoones determining one thing, than another presentes it selfe, which seemeth better: at length resoluing least delayes should breed danger, hee determined in that action which was honourable, to shew him selfe, and eyther by his prowesse free the King and his beloued from the tyranny of the vsurping Infidel, or yeeld his latest gaspe in their defence. How Dionicius naming himselfe Pheander, desirous to shew his force in defence of his Lady, & loue the princesse, gallantly offred his seruice to the king of Thrace and what hapned him. In this resolution, he came to the Kings presence, vnto whome dooing his humble dutie, and prostrating himselfe, hee sayth. My gracious Soueraigne, & liege Lord, pardon the bolde attempt of a rude stranger, whom dutiful zeale hath bound to your seruice, and of your gracious fauour to all men, vouchsafe mee that honour in this extreame, wherein your worthy Citizens stand, distressed by this faithlesse Infidell, who doth seeke your subuersion, and their vtter ruine and decay: whose presumption, if it please your Excellence to giue me leaue, shall by mee and such as I can by loue and money drawe vnto me, be chastened, and made to knowe, your Highnesse can expell at your pleasure, the power of a more strong and mighty enemie, who though you haue of curtesie suffered, it hath not beene of cowardize, as he shall well vnderstand. In this request, most gracious and renowmed Soueraigne, if it shall please you to honour me, I doubt not, (by the ayde of the highest) of a happy victorie. The King which during his long tale, had earnestlie noted his countenance and his grace, in vttering the same assured himselfe, that the honour of his house, which shewed in his courage, or the power of the eternall deitie wrought this motion in him, & therefore without any longer pawse, taking him courteously from his knees, determining to trie the Fortunes of this supposed Marchant, he sayth: 1 What euer thou be that honor vrgeth to this attempt, thankes for thy loue, wishing my good, and forwardnesse in venturing thy life, yet before I accept thee for my Champion, say (gentle friend) of what countrey art thou? what name and parentage? to the ende that I may giue thee honour as thy desertes and bloud do require: and answering me truely to these demaundes, tell me what mooued thee likewise, being so braue a man, and in thy flourishing estate, to hazard thy selfe in an action, wherein so many men of honour and great valour haue lost their liues. Know renowmed Lord (quoth the Prince) Numedia is my countrie, my father a Gentleman professing martiall Discipline, my name Pheander , the youngest of manie of my fathers sonnes, vnto whom my minority denyed such reuenewes and liuinges as might sufficiently maintaine my estate, which caused me to employ my stock in trade of merchandize, by which in time of peace I gained in your countrie wealth sufficient, which with my body I offer in your highnesse seruice, and doubt not but to free thy princely daughter from this vsurper, whose vertue the worlde so much renowneth: for, by that faith which I receiued at the Font-stone, so long as I may breath life, neuer shal vnhalowed Cur, triumph in your Graces ouerthrow, nor in her dishonor. The king ouer ioyed at these frank affaires of his champion, expressing by his outward signes, the inward delight of his heart, and the desire he had to accept this yonglings offer, taking great pleasure in his countenance, which was louelie, and no way inferiour to the best in his court for person, wisedome, and other good graces, which with aduise considered, he saith. Pheander , wel doest thou showe thy selfe a Gentleman, for vnder the habit of a Merchant Gentilitie cannot be hid, no poore estate can blemish the Noble, nor aduerse fortune whatsoeuer; but as golde is soone brought from the baser mettels to his forme by the skilfull finer, so are the Noble knowne by their vertues. Pheander , I haue cause to honor thee for thy loue and forwardnesse, as also for thy countrey, which (without flattering thee, or any ther abiding) I loue for your Kings sake. But to our matter, thou seest (my deer Pheander ) the millions of cares heaped vppon my gray head, through the oppression of this heathen Prince, whereby I am made more miserable than the meanest subiect in my dominions; and the more is my miserie, by recounting the wretched estate of my louing subiects, whom I hold as deare as my life, and wish that by resigning my life and crowne, I might free them from bondage, were it nothing els the tyrant required. But toward Gentleman, whose loue (wretch that I am) I cannot requite, my daughter (oh sorrow worse then death to recount) Nutania the onely solace of my life, and liues sole good, in whose weale consisteth my good, & by violence offered her, what good can betide me? she, she, my dear Pheander it is, that drencheth my soule into so deep a hel, that almost forgetting my selfe, liuing, I daily die; onely recounting the miseries she should endure, if the tyrant triumph in our ouerthrow: but he that in extreames sendeth comfort, hath reuiued mee, & relieued my ouercharged hart by thy kind offer, whose courage and hope of victory being such, as thou wilt hazard thy deerest blood for my daughters freedom. Thanks, (my good Pheander ) is all that I can yet yeelde thee: yet to adde more courage to thy noble minde, fighting for vs & our honor, my daughter, for whose good thou aduenturest, shall inuest thee with the order of Knighthood, the first honour that euer shee gaue to man of Arms, and shall pray for thy good successe: so calling for the Princesse, who was so discontented, that nothing could bee pleasing vnto her, who being come before him, after her huble duty done, desirous to know her kingly Fathers will, hee recounted the zeale of the Marchant vnto her, who had not onely offered his goods, but also his proper life to trye in battell his Fortunes against their enemy: wherfore Nutania (quoth the King) for that hee hath so voluntarily offered the same for thy sake, and I relying on my God, and in his prowes, haue accepted him for my Champion, by thy hand he shall receyue the honour of Knighthood, his Title The mayden Knight , and so prosper hee in his honorable action, and in all others as we wish, and himselfe desireth. The Princesse which diuers times had noted the courtly behauiour of Dionicius , was not a little pleased at her fathers motion, as one that in heartie good will, wished him better then modesty would suffer her to vtter: yet hearkening to her Fathers speeches, she beheld him with more gracious countenance, and viewing the Lineamentes of his person, each grace well regarded, shee inwardly bewayled his hard happe, that the Gods had framed him of no better reputation then a Marchant, who might well deserue the title of a King, put from her memento , by recounting her Fathers words, pausing thereon sometime, with a modest blushing countenance, she sayd: Kind Sir, whose honourable seruice offered for my Fathers good, and all our weales, his Subiects: if I yeeld you not such recompence as your deserts doe merite, blame me not of discurtesie, which haue no better knowledge of you, but accept the hearty thankes of a Uirgine, vnto whom I holde my selfe so farre indebted, as I can no other way recompence, then wishing your good, yet in earnest of better good, refuse not at my hands to receyue the honor of Knighthood, seeing my Lords pleasure is such: and drawing his Rapier, the Prince kneeling, shee inuested him with the order, by name of the Mayden Knight , and pulling a Iewell of rich price from her gowne, shee tyed the same in a most beautifull scarfe, beseeching him to weare it for her sake, wishing all happy fortune to his attempts. The new adopted Knight, whose heart ouerioyed for so great a fauour receyued from the Saint his hart wholly honoured, with many thankes dutifully rendered, kissed the Princesse hand, vowing himselfe her humble Seruant, and in all places to maintaine her modest beauty & Princely honour with his dearest blood. The time thus passed, word was brought the King that dinner was ready, whereby they were interrupted, whome for a time, we leaue to their repast, discoursing diuersly at table of the valour of the Mayden Knight, whose towardnes the King admired, which made his hopes the greater: not doubting but his Champion would proue no lesse valiant in Armes then they expected. At which the Princesse gloried not a litle, and the Nobles pleased at both their comforts passed the time with more content, then many dayes before whom we leaue to their mirth, and the Mayden Knight to the ordering of his affaires. How the Numedian King, after he had spent some time in sorrow for the Princes departure, exiled himselfe from the Court, pilgrim-like attired, in search of his Sonne the Prince, the Queen, with griefe for the King and her sonne died. The Numedian King, exiling himself from his Court, in habite of a Pilgrime, trauelling many vncouth places in search for his sonne, of whom he could heare no tidings, neyther could Barnardine for the industrie hee could vse, attaine to any knowledge of him his heart so much desired: through which, the heauinesse both of the Peeres and Commons, were dayly increased. And no maruell, when their soueraign the mirror of all Princely courtesie, had thus vnknowne, in the declining of his age, when his yeares required rest, banished himselfe his Country, louing subiects, and what else hee enioyed: the griefe of which so oppressed the heart of the Queene, that nothing might yeeld her any comfort. But pining in continuall sorrow, vtterly abandoning the Worldes comfort, to seeke her Comforter, whose dwellings are in the highest heauens, shee yeelded her due to death: whose funerals, with the effusion of many brinish teares of the Nobles, and sorrowfull lamentations of her subiects, was performed with such honour as to her estate required: whose obsequies finished, Barnardine regarding the benefit of the Common weale, and the Princes good, of whom their hope was to learne knawledge, vsed so kinde perswasions to the whole State, in a parliament holden of purpose, that the regiment was deliuered by consent, vnto sixe of the chiefest Nobles, who were solemnely sworn to maintain the dignities of the Crowne, in absence of the king & his sonne, vnto whome being lawfull heyres to the same, they should resign their Titles, whensoeuer they should challenge the same. Now Gentiles leaue we those distressed people, lamenting their Kings absence and the Queenes death, to tell you of the Mayden Knight. How the Knight Pheander, hauing mustered his companies, made sute to the Princes, that shee with the King might bee pleased to take view of them, and of their gracious acceptance of his forwardnesse, and honourable fauours shewed vnto him. And how a Heralde from the Campe of Mustapha arriued at the Court. This gallant Prince, the hope of Thrace carefull of his honour, and not vnmindfull of his new Mistresse, whose loue was the marke hee aymed at, hoping by accomplishing this victorie against the Souldane, to gaine that place of reputation with her that hee desired: for the better accomplishing of which he proclaymed by sound of Trumpet, that all such as would in that action aduenture their liues with him, shoulde bountifully be considered, all Estates from the Caualier, to the Mercerie, caused many to offer him their Sonnes, so that in short time, he had gathered more able men, then euer in so small warning were seene: such was the loue that his bounty had gained among all Estates, that of their kindnesse many repayred, more then for money, although the thought thereof is able to drawe the Cowarde to fight, so highly was this Stranger honoured. The diligence was such of this Prince, that in short time hee had his Companions, which were so furnished, as hee liued not in those Territories that euer saw the like. All thinges furnished for the field, hee became an earnest sutor to the Princes his Mistresse, to procure the King to viewe his armie, which with small sute shee obtayned for him, gracing him with all the fauours shee might, more delighting in him then in all the men that euer shee sawe. The time appointed for this Muster, after hee had giuen directions to all such Leaders, and other Officers, what course to take with their seuerall charge, they were conducted to the place appointed by himselfe, who mounted on a stately Courser, passed on through the City, his Captains attired in Gascoyne Coates of Watchet Ueluet, hauing on the breast and backe embossed with Goldsmithes worke, a Mayden head, according to his Deuice on his Armes, with the colour of his Mistresse Scarfe: euery Under-Officer in like sutes of Satten, his Mercinarie men in Iackets, hose and hats coloured alike, which caused the Beholders to admire the Stranger more then the Princesse. When the King beheld this mirrour of Honour, least thinking hee was sonne to his louing friend the Numedian King, and had with great delight viewed each seuerall Officer and their charge, with their order of March, and ranging in battell, all accomplished in such Warlike manner, as seldome hee had seene: and withall noted his person, with his brauerie in Armour, his gallant sitting a Horse, and manuring the same, his charging, running, and other signes of ensuing good, giuing him great thankes, he caused him to dismisse his companies for that time, to attend his pleasure at the Court, which he caused suddenly to bee done, attending the Kings pleasure at the Court, as hee was commaunded: the newes of his arriuall, being brought to the Princesse, who had but seene with what cost & rare deuises, each thing by her seruant was performed, iudging likewise that his loue to her was some cause, by his cullors, and deuises, willing to let him knowe how graciously the same was accepted, she came into the Presence, where finding her knight, after she had with a kind and louing Congee saluted him, calling him to a Bay window, with a modest and comely grace, she sayd. Sir, how much I finde my selfe indebted vnto you, for your (proffered seruice and forwardnesse) in performing the same, I will not say, that in time, what wants in mee to accomplish, my Kingly Father will recompence, who hath seene and well noted your diligence vsed for his safety, with your great cost and charge, which hee will not forget. In the meanetime (good Seruant) for so I will henceforth cal you, so you wil vouchsafe to accept of the title I will pray for your good successe and happy victory, wherby your renowne may passe the farthest parts of the earth, and our Countrey by your prowesse deliuered from heathen thraldoms. Uertuous Princesse (answered the Mayden Knight,) might it please your Excellence to conceiue of my wel meaning, as my desire is to deserue, my Fortune might be compared with the happiest that liueth. For on the Faith of a Souldier, and by the Maiestie of that Saint my heart most adoreth, there is none breathing life vnder the celestiall Globe, that shall commaund the simple seruice of Pheander but your Maiesty, bound thereunto by your Princelie fauours. Enough my good Seruant, (quoth the Princesse) I take your word, hauing great cause to beleeue you seeing your forwardnesse: But good Seruant, if I might vnder Benedicitie , know the Saint vnto whome your deuotions are bent, I would bee so bolde to offer a Uirgines prayer at her Shrine, for your good successe. The King ouer hearing their talke, brake them off thus. How now Madame, what haue you that Gentleman at shrift? (if so) and that his confession deserue a sharpe penance, yet be good to him, he may in time amend. Your Grace (quoth the Princesse) mistakes your selfe, your Highnes knoweth I neuer tooke orders, therefore my authority is not to absolue, and if by presumption I offend therein, I doubt the Fathers of our Church would reward me thereafter. But to let your Maiestie know the truth, perceiuing the desire he hath to do you seruice, I was bold to giue him thankes: further recompence, I leaue to your Excellence, who at your pleasure may better reward him. Thou hast well said (daughter, quoth the King) putting me in mind what I should doe, least forgeting mine honor to such as well deserue, I be reckoned amongst the number of those Princes, who with faire words & kinde lookes feede their subiects, so long as they haue either Patrimonie or other to doe them seruice, to the vtter ouerthrow of their posterities for euer, and they so farre in debt, as they dare not shew their heads, then shall they get (perhaps) some suite worth a hundred pounds a yeare, that haue consumed manie a thousands, maintaining a braue port, for his Princes honors. What said I? a hundred pound a yeare: nay, nor that, without the fauour of such as be chiefest in authority, and are neere the Prince, whose good will, if they can procure (it may be) they shall obtaine some small thing, scarce able to maintaine the port of a good yeoman: for I tell thee, such must be pleased, or else let the princes mind be forward to reward them, and by their bountie relieue their wants, their good Natures by perswasion of such as thinke all too much which goeth from themselues, and such as they please to bestow it vpon, shall be abused. This haue I heard gentle Knight, and grieue, that Honour should so vnkindly be rewarded: or that any subiect should forget his dutie so much, as for his owne Lucre, cause those that spend their blood in their Countreyes defence, their Lands and possessions, with emptie purses and heauie hearts, like men forlorne to walke the streets: exclaiming on them that should see their seruice better rewarded, to the dishonor of the state they liue in. This my Pheander I ofte recount, least in forgetting it, I fall to infamie by committing the like: but he that gaue me reason to know good, and to follow it, will neuer suffer mee to fall into so great follie, nor let me liue, to forget those maimed braue men, that venture for my good and my countreys weale: for while I may breath, the souldier shall be honoured in Thrace , and shall reape the reward of his merites, neither shall the Droanes, which in such times of perils hide their heads, sucke the hony off my garland. Like minds I wish all Princes, with carefull eyes to looke into the dooings of such, who as the Moath deuoureth the fine cloth, consumeth their princely reputation, & draweth the Comons, who by duty are bound to loue, from their Allegeance. Whilest the King was in this speech, word was brought him, that a Herald from the Campe attended his pleasure at the gate, requiring parlie, which he suddenly granted, commanding him to be brought to his presence: this vnhallowed Pagan who neuer feared God, nor was endued with any humanity, came vnto the Kings presence, with a shameles countenance, vsed this peremptory speech. How the Embassadour from the Turke deliuering a verie peremptorie message from his Lord, in disgrace of the Thracian King, and dishonor of his princely Daughter: the Maiden Knight, at his great suite, obtaineth the kings fauour to issue forth vpon them; his honourable exhortation, and speeches to his companies, with their forwardnes. King of Thrace, Mustaffa Cela , great Commaunder of the Empire, and Generall of those royall Armies, sendeth thee by mee, thy choyce, either of warres or peace, (peace) if thou deliuer thy Daughter vnto him, whom hee hath so often required, yet whereas his loue vnto her hath bin such, to make her his wife, his noble mind despiseth her so much, as his highnes will neuer so much honor hee, but in despight of thee, and to abate the pride of that disdainefull Dame, he will vse her as his concubine, & when he shal haue taken the flower of her virginitie, giue her to the basest villain in his camp. Thou knowest my embassage: deliuer her and liue; or by me returne thy resolute answere, for it shall not be many dayes, ere thy City shall flame with fire about thine eares. The King vexed at this vnexpected Message, could not answere him, so mooued was his choller, yet with as much patience as nature would permit, he said: Pagan, I haue heard, and with great paine endured thy Lords peremptory message: and that thou, & that Curre, from whom thou comest, shall well know the great difference betweene a Christian & him, and that he vnderstand how honorable we hold the law of Armes. I pardon thee thy life, which thy presuption doth require sharply to be punished. For answere to thy Lord, this briefly say, his threats I regard not: for my Daughter, as God hath giuen her me, and for she is the onlie ioy of my aged life, I will shield her, and in despite of the Pagan, and his greatest power, defend her chastitie: therefore depart, and say to thy Lord from me, his threats I wey no more then the words of a child: it is not his multitudes can daunt mee, were they ten times more then they are, my Daughter I will hold in despight of his beard, proud vsurper that he is. Thou knowest my will, make no stay. The Herald noting the sterne countenance of the King, and hearing his resolution, thought it not good to stay a replie, least his tongue swelling in his mouth, might not be eased without losse of his head; but glad to escape his furie, conueyed him from his presence, with all speed he could, posting to the pauillion of the Prince, vnto whom he deliuered the Kingr resolute answer: which he no sooner heard, but like one besides himselfe, he vowed in three daies to be reuenged of the old churle, who should tast the bitternes of his youthfull furie. Litle kneweth this proud enemie, the preparation made to bid him welcome, or that his owne destruction was so neere as after it prooued, The Mayden Knight, which with no small griefe had endured this proud demaund of the herald, whose whole request was for dishonor of her, he so much honored, awaked from melancholy, as out of a sound sleepe, protesting himselfe before the king, he saith: Renowmed soueraigne, with what griefe I haue endured the presumption of this vsurper, my heart denieth my tongue to vtter, neither shall I haue ioy of any thing, till I reuenge the wrongs offered your Maiestie and your Princely daughter, vpon that dogge. Wherefore dreed Lord, grant me licence to issue out of the citie with my companies, in the silent of the night, and I hope ere long to returne his proud challenge, with my sword in his throate. Thankes good knight, quoth the King, I accept the offer as much, as if thou hadst giuen me the whole world in possession, yet would I not so forward a man should aduenture himselfe without my company, whose cause it is, my selfe will accompany thee in the fight, and by my herald bid him battell, in which I doubt not of successe. The knight was much mooued, to heare his suit take no better successe, yet not willing to endure any competitor in the honour he hoped of, humbly besought his Maiestie of the honour hee bare to Armes, in this attempt to giue him leaue, and the rather for the reputation of the Princesse, which had giuen him his first honor. The King which saw by his countenance how malecontent, hee rested at this deniall, how loth soeuer he were to graunt the same, yet yeelded to his desire: and taking him from his knee, louingly embracing him, hee saith. Braue man at armes, take not in ill part, that I haue denied, neither thinke that it was in any sort to disparage you, or the hope I haue of your forwardnes, but for maintaining my owne honour, yet seeing your will is to aduenture for mee, goe in Gods name, and he be your defence, that euer comforteth his distressed & so pulling his signet from his finger, he gaue it him, willing that it be deliuered to the Gouernor of the City, and let him vnderstand his Highnesse pleasure was, that (he with his Armie) passe at his pleasure: and so taking his humble leaue of the King, and his gracious Mistresse, which affecteth him more then he could conceiue, he departeth, more ioyfull of this honour then to bee richly endowed. No sooner parted he the kings presence, but slacking as little time as was possible, he summoned his captains & officers, straightly charging them with all the diligence he could vse, to gather their companies, & to attend him in the market place, in which charge, no negligence was vsed, so yt by shutting in of the euening, each captaine with his charge both horse & foot, attending the comming of their Generall: who was not vnmindful of his busines, & after thanks giue to their Leaders, he marched with them to the gate that led them to the camp of the Souldan, and was vpon sight of the kings signet let out. Thus marched the noble Prince vntil he came halfe way, between the Campe and the City, where he called his principal men together, and sayd, Friends & copartners in Armes, you are now to consider what we haue taken in hand, for yt on our weale dependeth the whole estate of this common weal, if we preuaile, what good it is to be freed from such an enemy, there is not the simplest but can conceiue, hauing tasted the extremity which is incident to wars, & the pleasure of peace. Contrary, the slauery and seruile liues which these are compeld to endure yt fall into their hands, you may imagine, by the opprobrious vsage of your gracious Prince, & example of other christians which haue fallen into their hands, Wherefore, now is the time to shew your selus in this battel, if you shew your force no doubt of happy successe, to your eternal commendations, and to the benefit of your country, & freedom of your wiues children, & families. With these and other such speeches, hee so encouraged the heartes of his followers, as they vowed, to follow him with the hazard of their dearest bloud. How Pheander accompanied with a gallant troupe assailed the Turke in his Campe, against whom he obtained a most honourable victory. When the Knight saw the willingnes of his men, & that their resolution by outward motions, were as he expected, after he had giue them manie thanks, he made choice of fiue hundred to beare him comyany. And after he had giuen directions for the army to follow, he with his elected company marched on as closely as they might, for descrying of the enemie, who kept a court of Gard, not far from thence, vpon whom in the dead of ye night they entred and finding them at aduantage, (who little doubted any assault, hauing neuer before been assailed) some sleeping, some gaming, & others as ill imploied, they surprized them, & left not one to beare tidings of their ill fortune. This first attempt well performed, he passed on wt al speed to the camp, where the Prince lay, suddenly entred the same, where like a resolute and noble Gentleman, so he behaued himself, that it filled the hearts of his followers with great courage, who behaued themselues in such maner, that few escaped with life, but such as were grieuously maimed, so that they rather desired death, then longer to liue. The Prince, who was by one of his Bashawes counselled to flie, as the least euil, for auoyding of death, was brauely mounted on a swift runing Genet, of which ye Maiden Knight being informed, leauing the sight, he posteth after with so good speed, as the harmles Hare from the cruel iawes of the greyhounds, such haste made this worthie Conquerour, that in euill time for the Prince he ouertooke him, accompanied with 12. of his principall Bashawes, whom he with courage so assailed, that in a moment he had vanquished them all, leauing som breathles, some without arms, others without legges, no one escaped his fury. In which conflict the Prince escaped, but all in vain, the Destinies had determined there to finish the honour of that iourney by the hands of the Maiden Knight. Who ouertaking him, gaue him so grieuous a blow with his Curtelex betweene the necke and shoulders, as made him forget his way, saying: Stay, proud Usurper, and take my Lady the Princesse with thee. And pulled him violently, with all the force hee could by the Helmet, vnhorsed him, that the Knight verily supposed he had beene slaine: wherefore dismounting himselfe, he reuiued him againe, vnto whome hee sayde, My Lord, this is not for your honour, to braue a king in his owne Dominions, and in his Court, by your Herald, and then to haue so small a care of your word. In faith Pagan (for thy sake) Ile neuer credit any Pagan on his worde hereafter. Pittie is it a Prince of your esteeme shoulde after so many Lectures read, play the Trewant, (trust me) were I your Father, I should twigge the youth well, to learne him hereafter to be more carefull of his businesse. The Prince hearing himselfe so frumped, was more grieued thereat, then of all the losse hee had receiued. Wherefore with a heart full of carefull heauines, he saith: Braue man at Armes, what ere thou bee, to whom Fortune hath made me thrall, ill beseemeth such wordes of disgrace, to any one whome the Fates haue ouerthrowne, but cursed be my selfe, which gaue thee this opportunitie, cursed that negligence, which makes my foe triumph in my fall. Thou Mahomet, suffer me not as thou art a Prophet, to liue thus disgraced, to behold the face of any man, surprized by so cowardlie a Curre, who daring not to thrust his head out of the kennell but by stealth, hath wrought my vtter ruine and ouerthrow, taking his aduantage. But glorie not in this victorie, for it may be, thou shalt haue so great cause to repent thee therof, as pleasure now to behold me now thy prisoner. Your Lordship is disposed to be pleasant (qd. the Knight,) but it is the vse of Christians to giue loosers leaue to speake, if it so happen, my Fortune shall be the worse: In the mean time, your Grace shall be my guest, I haue an Hostes prouided, will bid you welcome, who, by this time, I doubt not, doth hear of your coming, you need not feare of your dinner. The Prince full of heauines could not tel what to answer, wherefore arming himselfe with all the patience he could to endure it, he was by the Conquerour commanded to horse. Long had they not ridden towards this armie, but he was encountred by diuers his Captaines, who missing their generall, at hap-hazard put themselues in search for him, and happily well they met him, who reioycing at his good fortune, taking the Prince prisoner, they recount vnto him the ruine and spoyle of the whole Army: for which theyr diliget courage and valour shewed, hee yeeldeth them most great & hearty thankes, beseeching them to take charge af his Armie and diuide the spoyles amongst them: which done: repayre at their pleasures to the City, whilest hee with his prisoner made hast to the Kings presence. The tidings of the Knights successe, was by some (such as honoured him) with speed reported at the Court, in which no part of his honours was left vnrecounted, whose policie and valiantnesse in Armes, the King with all the Courtiers admired: Imagining him by their worthy deeds of Chiualrie, to be the onely man at Armes, deseruing honour in all that Region: of whome there was no small ioy, and such Fame and renowne of his actions, as both in the Citie and Court there was no talke, but tended to the honour of the Mayden Knight , which liked not the Princesse Nutania a little, to beare her seruant in these his first attempts, venturing for her to haue such fortunate successe, so that where shee had begunne to like him before ( Cupid ) that commandeth the mightiest, beganne most furiously to assayle her, so that her tender heart vanquished therewith, was inforced to yeelde her selfe a slaue vnto his Deity: and giuing ouer other Court-like delightes, bend her whole study in seeking which way to winne her best beloued to her liking, for the accomplishing of which, many wayes were deuised & plotted but none thought sufficient, so that resting in a Labyrinth of confused thoughts, commaunding her attendants from her, she sayde. The Princesse Nutania, falleth in loue with her champion Pheander, hee arriueth at the Court in great honour, presenting the Turkish Prince with his Bashawes: with their pleasant discourses at their meetings, and honors done the Mayden Knight. thy selfe, who yeelding to follow the follies of thy youthfull minde, hast planted thy Loue thou knowest not on whom, a straunger, and of no more reputation then a Marchant, a base Trade, and most fraudulent, as I haue heard many Nobles discusse, whereby they obtaine to great wealth, and by their extraordinary meanes wring such young Gentleman as are forced to haue to doe with them, from their ancient Patrimonies, making of Noble men and Gentiles of great worshippe beggers, and their owne base borne brattes, to become young Masters, which in time, and small time, consumeth that in riot, which their miserable Fathers, by extortion, false reckonings, vnsatiable vsurie, and other loose dealings, solde their soules, the precious Image of our Sauiour, to the Diuell. But wretched wretch whether wandrest thou? these beene points for thee to stand vpon, thou hast now vsed the game, and art bound by such a band, as there is no remedy but see it thou must: therefore leaue to discourse what hee was, or hath beene. Thou hearest by generall report of all men, hee is honorable, in wars valiant, bountifull, and endued with al maner of Gentlemanlike conditions, which argueth him discended of better Parentage, then he will acknowledge: And therefore cease not to loue him, who by all coniectures, if outward shewes proceede of the motion of the heart, regardeth thy honour, then requite his seruice Nutania , and seeke in time to quench that flame, which beginneth, but yet to warme, lest encreasing by little and little, it consumeth thee. In extreames the Noble mind is best knowne, happy are they accounted, which forewarned can eschue a mischiefe; If thou canst winne thy Loue, what creature may be compared with thee for happie content? Be resolute Nutania , scare no colours, thy loue is planted on such a one, who for his vertues may be mated with the greatest Princesse on the earth: then stand not on termes of his being, but determine to loue him, faint hearted souldier neuer gained conquest, if he be base, thou maist aduance him. Thou art heire to the Crowne of Thrace , and thy fathers sole delight, who then should gainsay thy will herein, (fathers sole delight said I) yea there Nutania , layeth a blocke which thou canst hardly remoue. Thy father, what will he aged King say? when he shall heare of thy loue so basely planted, which hast refused to be wife to two famous Kings, requiring thee with great sute in marriage: Refraine fondling from this rash determination, let thy fathers loue be a raine to hold thy vnbrideled will, feare his displeasure which gaue thee life, and seeke not by thy follie to bring his head with sorrow to his graue, which if thou persist, will be such a corasiue to his heart, and such a staine to thine honour, as the memorie of Nutanias disobedience will neuer be raced out. With these and such like motions of good, she sought to withdraw hir loue from him, that for birth and other noble actions deserued her better, albeit vnknowne to her: but what euer he be, the more she sought to suppresse the flame of her loue, the more it encreased: that without regard of fathers good, or her owne honour, she determined to loue him: yea the Mayden Knight with his Prize, was arriued at the Court, whom the King and Nobles welcommed with all curtesie they could shew, as ioyfull of his safe returne, who had so honourably borne himselfe in that action, as if he had conquered Europe , which kindnesse to the knight, was recompence sufficient for all his charge and hard aduenture. The Princesse, who was awaked from her studies by report of the knights comming, sumptuously attired as shee could, as beseemeth her estate, accopanied with all her troupe of Ladies and Maides of honour, came vnto the Presence, who no sooner approached the place where the Knight was, but beholding to the exquisite perfection of her beauty, which hee much delighted in, was suddenly bereaued of his sences, so that he stood as a man which had lost himselfe, yet reuiuing loath to make manifest what with great griefe hee had concealed so long: humblie on his knees, presented the glory of his enterprise vnto her saying. Most gracious Princesse, as by your most excellent hands, I receyued my first steppe to honour, and fighting for your Graces and Kingly Fathers sakes, it hath pleased God to prosper mee with a happie victory, for which good, hauing nothing worthy to present your Grace as I desire, yet in knowledge of my duetie, to your Excellence, to whom my life and seruice is deuoted: I humbly beseech you, accept this Gentleman my Prisoner and your Noble Fathers mortall enemy. The Princesse, to whom nothing could be more pleasing, then the sight of her beloued Knight, graciously accepted the Prisoner, rendering great thankes for the same, as also for his valour shewed in her defence. And then turning to the captiued Prince, she said. My Lord, you see the chance of Fortune, and how mutable shee is in all actions, sometimes fawning, sometimes frowning: but whether by your fortune or cowardise, or both, you are now at their mercy, whose ouerthrow you assured yourselues of,  & which you more desired then all the teritories of the earth, but our God which neuer suffereth his seruants to perish, hath mightilie defended vs, it is not your mighty powers can daunt the hearts of Christians, whose God is their guide: neither regard we them at all as a matter of any trust, your eyes can witnrsse, who hauing an Armie able as you thought to haue vanquished all Christendome, is by a handfull to your multitudes surprised. Yet dismay not my Lord, a Maiden is your Iaylor, who will vse you more honourably then you can imagine, or your hard threats deserue. The Prince which saw the beauty of the Princesse, whom he so ernestlie vpon reports had desired, was astonied greatly, holding ye same that was bruted, to be nothing to her worthinesse, therefore accusing himselfe of great impietie, that had borne Armes against the onely Paragon of the earth, and not by curtesie haue continued his loue begun, ashamed of himselfe, he sayth. Renowmed Lady, Fortunes darling, & Beauties chiefe pride, though mishap hath made me of a Prince and heire to the mightiest Potentate of the earth, a captiue, and that by thy champion I am dishonoured, and my power vanquished crosses which may cause the stoutest that euer liued, to crie out on Fortune, and to curse the Destinies, yet am I comforted in the sweetnes of your words, which disdayneth to vse the vtmost cruelty you might, or take his life that had vowed to vse you with more extreames, then if by the greatest torments I could haue afflicted you withall, I had caused you die many thousand deaths, if it were possible so many could be incident to one body, Had I preuailed of thy curtesie, famous Princesse, I canot say what I would, but vow vnto thee by the honour of my fathers crown, while I breath to remaine a true Liiegeman vnto thee vertuous Nutania , whose curtesie hath subdued my chollor, and put my oppressed heart from a million of cares wherewith it was opprest. My Lord, quoth the Princesse, your Lordship is merily disposed, indeed women are gods children, wonne with a toy, such fooles they are: yet my Lord, I wold you did know, how little I esteeme the flattery of men, of what estate soeuer, they would spend their friuolous speech elsewhere: for your Lordship, though you please to iest, I thanke God you haue such cause so to doe, whom I prayse for the victorie receyued and next his duty, my seruant for his paines imploied for our safety. And with these words she gaue him so gracious a looke, as well might the standers by see it was not fayned, but that her speech spoken in his prayse, preceeded of the inward motions of the heart, which of the captiue Prince was not vnperceiued, which caused him to replie thus, Madame, for auoyding of that odious sinne of flatterie, which my heart hath euer so contemned, I dare not say what I would, yet seeing the destines are so pleased, to yeelde me a prisoner to my enemie, I reckon my vnhappinesse the lesse, which haue so gracious a Lady for my Keeper, of whom, expecting no better then death, I am by your comfort quite depriued of that feare. And for this noble Gentleman, how fortune and the Fates hath fauoured him in this victory, wherin I am so dishonoured, euery man cannot conceiue. But were the honour thereof a million more, yet not to bee weied in the ballance where your Grace doth counterpoise the same, which is more to bee esteemed then the worlds good: how you hold him in regard I know not, but if an enemies prayse may any way honour him, I say, and with my blood will auouch, that for his valour none liueth on the confines of the earth his equall: wherefore Madam, boast you of his his worthinesse which is peerelesse, and worthy for all perfections to bee honoured of the mightiest Monarke that liueth. How Theophilus King of Thessaly, who had suffered shipwracke at sea, in a storm was brought a shore in Thtace on a Rafte, with his royall entertainement by the gentlemen of the Countrey, and his honourable welcome to the Court by the King and his Nobles. Thankes my Lord, quoth the Princesse, for your good opinion of my seruant, I doubt not but hee will say as much for you, when opportunitie shall serue, who I assure you, is as curteous, as otherwise honourably endued. While they were thus pleasantlie discoursing, Word was brought the King that Theophilus Prince of Thessaly , who by the outrage of a cruell storme, had suffered shipwracke, was found on a rafte, driuen a shoore vpon the farthest parts of his confines; where being vnknowne to any of his subiects, but by his owne report, was by the Gentlemen of his countrey entreated, as beseemed his estate: & accopanied with a Princely Traine, was within half a daies iourney of the Court. The suddaine report whereof brake their talke, the King commaunding his traine presently to be ready horsed to accompany him, who with diligence fayled not to obey his commaund: and so orderly marching through the City, they ride easily paced, vntill they meete the straunger King, betweene whom great courtesie was vsed. The King gaue thankes, and louing countenance to the Gentlemen, who had to their great cost so honoured him, by entertaining this straunger, whereby his Countrey was made famous. Thus with diuers discourses they passed the time, till they came to the Court, where a stately lodging, was purueyed for him, and officers appointed to attend his person, as royally as if he had beene in his owne Pallace, where solacing with the King and his Nobles, we leaue him. How Pheander, beeing now in Court, in sight of his loue and Lady, affections began to reuiue, and a melancholy passion possest him, which was noted of many, but chiefly of the Princesse, with their honourable parley, and fauourable proffers. To returne vnto Pheander the Mayden Knight , whose entrailes frying with the scorching flames of his Mistresse beautie, had so much changed his colour, and empaired his strength, that enforced by great griefe, and extremity of his loue, hee withdrew him to his chamber, where casting himselfe on his bed, with a million of carefull thoughts eftsoones, determining to seeke the Princes fauour: And then by contrarie motions, fearing the successe of his sute, carrying the report of no better then a Marchant, which might giue cause of great dislike, and disparage his sute, he saith, Miserable Dionicius , whom the Fates continually causeth by their hard hap dayly to complaine, cursing ye time of thy Natiuity, and the starres which gouerned thine aspects, which neyther time or place can remedy, faint hearted wretch, that seeking thy owns ouerthrow, encreaseth thy griefe, by concealing the cause, Leftest not thou thy Princely father, to come hither where thou mightest enioy ye presece of thy beloued mistresse and in doing her seruice, to acquaint her with thy loue? & cowardlike shamest thou to let her know thy zeale, whose curtesie is without compare, and euery way sheweth in what regard she holdeth thee, that hath procured her libertie in aduenturing thy life? a pleasure that of a thankfull mind can neuer be forgotten. What knowest thou whether her loue be as much to thee, whom womanly modestie denieth to reueale, else mightst thou happily know it? No, no, fondling, thy fortune is not so happie, which euer hath liued in vnhappinesse, yet dispaire not, nor like a wretch die in thy Cabenet, Rowse thee, and consider what thou art, giue not euer thy desires to miserable death, without acquainting her with thy loue: spare to speake, and spare to speed. A Prouerbe not so old as true, which if thou follow, will either giue thee comfort by her curteous grat, or by deniall, hasten thy death, by which thou shall be fred from these torments; enioying life, and liuing, enioy thy sweet delight, or by death, and these torments. In this resolution, hauing banished dispaire, aiming himselfe with hope of good successe, stretching his weake limbes, he hasteneth to the Presence, whose absence had bene noted of most Courtiers attendant there, but especially of the Princesse, who (albeit) found the companie vnfurnished, wanting his companie, yet durst not enquire of him, doubting the suspition of iealious eyes: But Fortune, who had so long spurned at him with her foote, gaue him this opportunitie to raise him, whom she had like to haue ouerthrowne, chauncing to looke out of a window which opened into a Parke belonging to the Court, hee espied the Princesse, pleasantly passing the time with her Traine of Ladies, which opportunitie hee was not willing to lose, but with all such speed as his fainting legges could make, reuiued by the sight of his sweete chase, with all sayles spread, in short time hee recouered his wished desire, who was no sooner of the Princesse seene, his humble dutie done, and she hauing required the same, giuing him the time of the day, with a most pleasant and friendly countenance, she challenged him of negligence, whom she had not seene in two or three daies: and leading him politikely, pretending matter of importance, to impart vnto him, from the company, she brought him neare the side of a faire Copes, which so ouershadowed them, that the Sunne beames could not offend them, where they might both boldly say whatsoeuer it pleaseth them, without being heard or seene of any, which might interrupt them, which caused her to take opportunitie to discusse with him thus. Seruant quoth shee, I pray thee say, of the dutie thou hast vowed thy mistresse, and by those sweete thoughts which are best pleasing vnto thee, what is the Ladie to whom thy loue is dedicated? for loue doubtlesse thou doest, thy countenance bewrayeth it, which I haue noted, with more regard then becommeth a maiden: yet of care to thee, whose health I tender, for thy curtesie and good seruice done, which I would requite in the best maner I might; and for thy lookes sheweth thy heart craueth to be pittied of thy Ladie, let me know her, who may chance stand thee in some steed, for women may preuaile much one with another. The Knight wrapt into a heauen of ioyes, hearing the goddesse of his deuotion, with such fauour and kindnes to vse him, with a blushing countenance standing at the barre, before her, whose sentence pronounced, was either life or death, he saith. Honorable and gracious mistresse, giue me leaue so to call your highnesse, since you haue dained a captiue the title of your seruant, & pardon my presumption, answering your demand; that I loue I cannot denie, which argueth your skill in physicke great (whom) my tongue is restrained to reueale? but if your highnesse could iudge whose loue I most adore, & long haue, & iudging, ease me, I should haue cause to say, no physicke proferer on the earth whatsoeuer, might compare with my gracious mistresse for skill: I dare say no more, fearing to offend. The Princesse all this time gazed on the perfection of her seruant, as deeply enamoured of his perfection, as the knight inueagled with hers, for her eye made a suruey of his excellent feature: which she found more perfit, by how much the more shee had bent her liking to loue him. Thus Loue, which had assailed both their hearts, endued them with such a Simpathie of ioy, beholding themselues al alone, that with ouermuch ioy they were stricken mute, so that how much soeuer their hearts desired, to let each other know their loues, they could not reueale the same. In this heauen of happy content they had not long been, but Guenelia a Lady that attended the Princesse, brought her word the King her Father, with the King of Thessalie , was comming into the Parke, which plaee they had chosen to recreate themselues: Where passing on by faire Paris , they diligentlie liste to the sweet records of the prettie birds, who skipping from tree to tree, gaue as wel the content, beholding it, as the eare pleasure in their notes: great was the delight they receyued, viewing the beautie of the place, which for pleasant walks, sweet groues, & fruitfull trees of al sorts, was matchles: vnto which, many pleasant brooks had recourse, on the banks of which, finding the place beautied with natures gifts, they sate them down, earnestly beholding the pleasure of the Fishes, how pretilie they chased one the other, with manie a pleasant conceiued toye, which they noted, censuring of each seuerall action as they thought best to increase their mirth. When some time was spent on this pleasant maner, Philarchus King of Thrace , finding himself al alone with the king of Thessalie , hauing neuer questioned of him his vnhappy Fortune, began with him thus. How the King of Thessaly communed with the King of Thrace. The Princesse Nurania discouereth her loue, The Mayden Knight by a letter craueth the Princesse liking. The Knights letter to the Princesse. Let it not be displeasing vnto thee (famous King) that I intrude my selfe so farre into thy familiaritie, to require the cause of your Graces trauell, through which your life was so endangered, if you vouchsafe mee this fauour, you shall commaund a matter of more import, so it please you, at my hands, The Thessalian King, attending his vnexpected question, was driuen into such sundrie thoughts, that his colour showed better his discontent to recount it, then his tongue ablenesse to answere the Kings demaund, how willing soeuer he was to satisfie him, yet after some pause taken, he saith: Right courteous, and Mirrour of the world for Nobilitie, though nothing can be more displeasing to my troubled heart then recounting my aduerse Fortune: yet that your Grace shall not find any ingratitude in me, at whose hands I haue receyued sach honourable entertainment, attend me. It is not many yeares, since Mantonna my father deceased, who left me (vnhappy I) his successor, to inherite the Crowne, which I did not long enioy, before Donaria King of Egypt requested of me my Sister in marriuge, who being beautifull, and in the flourishing time of her yeeres, hauing not yet attained to the full of fifteene, young enough to be bestowed, yet of that wisdome, that I referred the choice of her loue to her owne liking, induced thereunto, by the many euils happening by such made marriages, where the children are forced by the couetous desires of their Parents to ioyne wealth to wealth, others for great patrimonies, all for Lucre, few or none for loue. But whether the beauty of my sister Phedra (for so was she called) or the desire of her Dowrie, which was great, or eyther of them, or both, I canot say, but my sister being made acquainted with his sute, I craued her answere, for which his Ambassadors attended at my court, with the best entertainment I could giue. whome my sister Phedra , with her own mouth, answered (woe is me) vnhappy the tongue that pleaded deniall to his suite, but most of all, vnhappy the houre when first of all hee determined to craue her at my hands, in whose power it was not to graunt, No sooner arriued his Nobles at the Court, and he scarsly receyued the summe of her answere, but as one bereft of all honour, reason, and gouernment, he vowed reuenge on me and my Countrey. And leauying a mighty power, both of Horse and Foot, assayled mee in mine own territories, whom by the mighty power of the Almightie, I expelled my Land, to their great dishonour, and no small losse vnto my Subiects. Yet how great soeuer his ouerthrow was, (an honorable minde I must say) were the cause iust, he ordained as mightie a power by Sea, wherof being by espyalls aduertised, of the time (as neere as they could gesse) they would be ready, with a power well shipped and furnished, I mette him neere his owne Confines, where a mortall fight was begun, and most valiantly continued, neither side giuing any shew of fainting. But alas, too soone commeth that griefe, which melteth my hart into thousands of tears, to recount the Admiral of mine owne Squadron being suncke, and two others forced by the cunning hand of their Gunners, to lye by the Lee, the rest fainted: which being perceiued by the Enemie, they borded, and by hundreths entered my ships and Galleys, who were valiantly repulsed. But men can doe no more then God will giue chem leaue: So long they continued the Fight, that the Scupars gushed bloud, as they had often with the water deliuered by the Pumpe. And here lay some maimed, and there a number slaine. This pittifull Stratageme, when my heart with heauines beheld, being so hardly assailed my selfe, after that I was cleared from the Fleete, the winde fauouring me with a happie gale, and my shippe being good of saile, I forsooke the Fight, in hope to haue recouered into mine owne Countrey, and with a new supplie, haue giuen him welcome thither. But my hopes herein deceiued, a boysterous storme growing, the Sea who is mercilesse, arose in extremity, swelling with such outrage, yt my battered Ship no longer able to endure her cruelty, was put against our wills, on thy Coast, my Pylot vnacquainted with the same, and a hoarie myst ouer spreading the Land, suddenly the Shippe stucke, being neare the shoare, which draue vs to great terror. (Which to remedie, the Marriners did their best, but in vaine striue they that labour against his will that commaundeth all. (What should I say the outrage of the storme was such, as forced the ship vpon the Lee-shore, which gaue vs all cause to remeber our maker & with harty praier to craue his assistace: But our comfort was comfortlesse, our shippe split, and we all driuen to make what shift we might, my selfe happning on the maine yarde, after that I had been grieuously beaten at sea the whole night, was driuen a shore on your confines, where I neuer heard of any other that were saued. With this, the teares restrained his speech, that he could not speak, which moued the King to more pittie of his estate and friendlie embracing him he sayd: No more my Lord at this time, I am sorrie that I haue giuen you such cause of griefe, thus by recounting so lamentable a state, renue your passed griefes. But comfort good king, when Tides bee at the lowest they spring againe. If the Egyptian king bee so extreame, reason with curtesie wil not content him, the cause being no other, but to force the loue of a woman vnto him, of which (perhaps) he were better be without: On the word of a King, and by my honour I sweare, I will not leaue you, vntill I see you setled in your Kingdome. Thus the King whom sorrow had ouerburthned, was by the comfort of ihis noble King (his Hoast) recomforted, whose whole study was now in preparing an Armie to ayde him, vnto which care we leaue them. Nutania , whose restlesse passions neither time nor place could alter, burning in these remediles thoughts, considering the pennance her louing heart was like to endure, she fel into this humour. Nutania , how haue the Fates ordained to make thee vnhappie? that thou being deliuered from an oppressing enemy then stoppes in Loue to beginne a new Tragedie. Thou seest her fawnings is but flatterie, then seeke to eschew the, enter not too farre in the foorde, least minding but to wet thy shooe, thou plunge ouer head and eares. Thy yeares (albeit not many) with the examples of others, whome thou hast read, may learn thee to bee wise: if thy fancy be fixed on such vanitie, as may breed thy sorrow, expell it as thou maist, suffer not loue to harbour in thy heart, for harboured, he commonlie pleades possession, and once possest neither force nor intreatie may remooue him, so ambitious a Tirant is he, that voyd of pittie, against law and all hostilitie, he holdeth what he list. Alas Nutania , if thy enemie be such, what auaileth thee? thou mayest wish to be freed from his tyrannie, but canst neuer auoyde it, so imperious is hee, yet not manlie, but as a Coward, making the breach, where the wal is weakest: poore Women is the marke whereat most commonly he aymeth, who being by Nature pittifull, are easie to belieue, and by too light credit, are taken by them they best like of. Thus (poore wench) doest thou nothing but heaue Feathers against the winde, which returne into thine owne eyes: thy speeches vttered in Loues dishonour, will be challenged, and like a traiterous Rebell to his Deitie shalt thou be conuicted, arraigned & condemned, for deprauing his Godhead. If it be death (fondling) to speake against the Maiestie of a Prince, what is it to contemne the powers aboue? The best remedie thou hast is reconciliation, wherewith the Gods are pleased, and hartilie sorrowing for thy misse, yeelde thy selfe vanquished: and yeelding, seeke by fauour, to attaine the end of thy desires. Thy loue is matchles, and doubtles honourable, his countenance sheweth the true badge of Nobility, and his valour and bountie doe answere, what his other perfections do promise: I haue often heard it spoken, that womens helps in extremitie haue bin great; if that be true proofe Nutania , call thy wits together, and so ende thy tormentes, by enioying thy hearts content, so much discontent, by yeelding to the same. Thus resolued, without longer stay, shee called vnto her Guenela, her chiefe attendant, who from her infancie had bin broght vp with her: In this Guenela , she conceiued her greatest hope, vnto whom she saide: Guenela , since I had reason to discerne good from euill, thou knowest how I haue tendered thee, and how willing I would be to seeke thy prefermet: make tryall when thou please so shalt thou be assured of that which iustly thou mayst hold in suspence. But leauing these coniuring words, I must Guenela commit vnto thy secrets, a matter of import, whereon my honour and reputation dependeth. For I tell thee Guenela , I haue made choyce of thee amongst all those which I may command, as of her I loue, & haue best cause so to doe, hauing had such societie, also should I rather chuse to dye ten thousand deaths, then reueale it. Guenela , which had her whole hope of good from the Princesse, hearing her speeches, with teares standing in her eyes, proceeding of ioy, for the honor done her by her Ladie, protested vnto her by Heauens maker, and what else he framed, to be secret in her determinations, and doe her best endeuour to accomplish whatsoeuer she commanded. The Princesse taking her word for currant, in whome she neuer found deceyt, saide: Guenela , that it is incident to all creatures in their kinde to loue, I know thy wittes be not so simple, but thou canst conceiue, and hee that frameth vs, directeth our likings as best pleaseth him, be it Prince or Beggar, from the highest to the simplest, and he (my Guenela ) hath linked my liking, to a most braue toward Gentleman (on whome, I thinke) if affection which is blinde, deceiue me not, is worthy to be mated with the greatest in degree on the earth. To keepe thee with friuolous speech, is no time now, hauing other matter enough to discourse: therefore that thou maiest know him to whom my loue is vnited, Pheander the new adopted Knight is hee, ( Pheander ) famous for his valour, renomed for his bountie, and admired for curtesie, he, he, Guenela , is the ioy of my heart (and my hearts sole delight) without whom I cannot liue, no, I will not liue, I, neither may I liue, such is the seruice my heart hath vowed in loue vnto him: therefore if thou loue me as thou hast profest, by thy industrie seek to saue my life, which cannot but perish not obtaining my desires. Guenela , listning to her discourse, willing to become second in this Comedie, had her braines beating already in search of the charge committed vnto her, yet would she not answere any thing suddenly, considering how displeasing speeches spoken out of time, be vnto Louers corasiues: yet chearing the Princesse; she requested vntill the next morning, respite for answer, which the Princesse graunted, affying greatly in her, which was wise and well demeaned, many wayes (somtime doubtfull) somtime pleasing, sifted her sences to the proofe, whom to her studie we leaue. The Mayden Knight , whose extremes were far more, if more might be) after his abrupt parting with his Mistresse, that he grew so melancholy, as nothing (were it vyands) to relieue his weake corpse, neither the daintinesse of pleasing sweet Musicke wherewith his friendes presented him, might any way delight him, so that in outragious maner he exclaimed on his misfortune, cursing the tidings bearer of ye kings repaire to the Parke, and his tongue for not reuealing his griefe, his Physition so ready to heare, that dispayring of his hope to enioy her, he was likely to mischiefe himselfe: yet reason affirming, that the learnedst Physition could not discouer the disease of his Patient, without he shew it, how near soeuer he gesse. Entering further in consideration of her fauourable speeches, shaking off feare like a hardy souldier, he determined in writing to let her know his loue, since hee had no hope to meete her againe at the like aduantage. Therfore like the condemned, hoping of pardon, iiueth the Knight, yet desirous to be resolued, either of comfort or despayre, he calleth for pen and incke, and wrote thus. happinesse and hearts content. haue bin forced to seek the loue of beutiful Ladies, I haue the lesse cause to accuse my fortune, or exclaim against his soueraignty, who hath framed my hart to like & loue your Excel: how long I haue honoured thee only, I omit, or to impart the many griefs endured for your sake, which as you are by nature pittifull, so vouchsafe to credit the lines of your sworn seruat, by your fauour acclaim from the gates of death, my soule, which is ready to leaue this wretched corps vpon your deniall. Therfore peereles Lady, if thou hold the life of thy seruant in any regard, grat me thy loue, and with thy loue, gracius liking: so shal I liue to honour thee, or die throgh thy cruelty. I write not as a Poet, but as a souldier: and therfore it thou dislike these lines, attribute the shortnes of my stile to my faithfulnesse, which without flatterie, haue deliuered the summe of his misery, and hope shall be by your gracious courtesie eased. So attending your answere, eyther of life or death, I wish thy ioyes neuer to haue an end, and my selfe speedy death, without your liking. Your Graces, in life most humble, PHEANDER. How the Mayden Knight procured Guenela, the Princesse wayting woman, to deliuer his Letter, & their Parley. When he had ended these lines, sealed and directed the same, hee could not finde by many deuises which he sought, how it should be brought to his Mistrisse hands, at length after many sundry wayes sought, this was thought most best: Calling to mind Guenela , the Princesse maid, which he had often noted to be in some regard with her he determined to procure her, either of curtesie, or for reward, to deliuer it. And very early in ye morning, as soon as he could get readie, addressed himself to the Court, attending ye comming of his mistresse thither, as she vsually did, but vnhappy Pheander , it fell not out so well with him this day, for the Princesse distempered in her thoughts, hath her minde so much of her loue, & how to obtaine it, as she enioied no sleepe by night, nor content by day, so that shee was inforced with weakenesse to keepe her chamber, to the great discomfort of the King and griefe of all the Ladies. But as many crosses are incident to Louers, so Cupid which is good to some that serue him (albeit) the news of his Ladies malady was burthensom to him, yet his chiefe desire was to haue som speech, passing into ye garde either to walk or for som occasion of her Ladies, who Pheander followed wt a cheerfull countenance more like a Nouice in loues school, the any wayes skilful, yet whetted on by the hopes his heart conceiued, hee saluted the Gentlew. who was not a little abashed to see the knight so near her, nor could she iudge any cause of his coming vnto him yet as shee was curteous, as willing to heare what he wold say, as he to vtter the same, with a face blushing, shewing a kinde countenance, she enquired of his health, with other ordinarie prattle: which he answered, returning her manie thankes, sayd, Mistresse Guenela , though my deserts haue neuer merited fauour at your hand, yet let me craue your furtherance in a suite, for that I heare the Princesse is weake, and not willing to be troubled, that I may not attayne her speech, and my busines of importance, compelleth me to morrow earely to leaue the Court, to deliuer this letter to her owne hands, and at your leasure returne no such answer as she please to deliuer. In doing which, you shall doe me a fauour of great esteeme, which shall not be bestowed on an vnthankefull man. The Gentlewoman which did know where the Princesse shooe did wring her, supposing the knight to be wounded with like affection, was glad to become so happy a messenger, to her who could willingly vouchsafe him as partner of her best fortunes, yet making a kind deniall, shee sayd, Sir, though I could willingly doe you more seruice the modestie, will I acquaint you with, it is not the part of our Countrey Gentlemen, to make poastes of Gentlewomen, hauing Pages fit for the purpose: if I refuse your request, attribute it to no discurtesie in mee, which am very loth to offend her highnes, not knowing whether the sentence of your paper may discontent her or no. That many messengers haue incurred displeasure, yea and losse of life, as the cause hath deserued, I hope it is not vnknowne vnto you, yet hath the harmelesse messenger knowne as little what hee carried, as I desirous to know of you. Sweet Guenela quoth the knight, that it is wisedome to beware by others harmes, I denie not, yet is it discurtesie to deny the request of a Gentleman, which haue euer shewed my selfe a dutifull seruant to his Highnesse, and honouring him can I frame my heart to preiudice that Lady of incomparable vertue? No, no, heauens neuer permit me life to offend herin the least sort. Therefore doubt no such matter for on the word of a Gentleman, my life shalbe offered, and freely giuen, to excuse thy friendship, wherein I am so greatly pleasured by you. Guenela noting by the often changing colour in telling his tale, his heart was not his owne, but had some more businesse in his hand then hee would impart, loath to offend his patience by her deniall, saide: Sir, perswading my selfe of your loyalty, I will for this time become your Ambassadour, although it should empayre my credite with her Excellence, whose fauour I holde as dear as my life, and that you shall assure your selfe of my trustinesse herein, so it please you to meete me in this place to morrow, by that time the Sunnes power shall haue drawne the dew from off the earth, I shall returne you answere as you desire. Thanks good Guenela for thy curtesie, assure you I will not dye in thy debt, if ever Pheander may requite it by anie industrie. In the meane time quoth hee, fauour me so highly as weare this for my sake, and pulling off a diamond of great prize gaue it her, which she was loath to accept, & yet giuing thankes for his curtesie, she sayd. Sir, would you did vnderstand, I prize not my pains, that you should reward me with hire, or doe you good in hope of benefit: for as it is vnfitting a Gentlewoman to take gifts bestowed in such manner, so is it discurtesie, and no part of a womanlike condition, to refuse the gift of a friend: therfore accept my thanks till I may better deserue it. Thus time passing away, Guenela taking her leaue, departed towards the Princesse, and the Knight to his lodging, where, how many sundry thoughts assayled him, I leaue to them, that haue endured the like. How Guenela hastneth to the Princes lodging, vnto who after many pretty communications on both parts, shee deliuered the letters, and how she obtained grace with the Princesse for her paines, with her resolution to loue, and her kind acceptance of his sute. ye Princesse perceiued, who was iealous of her being acquainted with her maladie, who calling her to her beds side she enquired where she had spent the time so long from her, knowing that all her attendants were combersome vnto her, but onely Guenela , with whom she might passe the time in discoursing her loue. Madame, dutie commands me, answer your demand, yet hauing bene to search some daintaine, that might yeeld delight to your weake stomacke, and cause better disgesture, by chance prying in the garden for such things, I was encountred by the best skild in the dominions of Thrace , who gaue me a receit, which I iudge by my simple skill, will giue your Maiestie great ease; yet doth the Physition doubt whether your stomacke will disgest it. This gracious Lady quoth Guenela , hath bene the cause of my absence, and no other. (Alas good wench) how am I beholding to thee, that caring to recouer my strength, searchest the depth of thy skill, but Guenela , in vaine seekest thou her health, whom no Physitia with all his hearbs, drugs, and simples, balmes, emplaisters, or what Art may prouide, can remedie, onely God the great commander, must by his grace bring my desires to ende, or by death, ende my daies of life. What Madam, euer in this tune? once alter these discords which maketh your musickeiar, & sing ye beliefe with a cheerfull voice, so may your mind be a little eased, and the receit I haue to minister, worke with the more effect: I speake this Madam, of experience, for euery skilfull Physitian will prepare the body of his Patient, before he minister. Therefore Madam, if you will shake off this melancholy, you shall haue a tast of what I promise, if not, your grace must pardon me, it were great pittie so precious a thing should be cast away. Well Guenela , quoth the Princesse, thou art disposed to crosse me with thy words, which doth but increase my disease, yeelding small comfort: therefore leauing those Iests, say me my good wench, if thou haue ought will doe me good? (if not) vse me no more thus vnkindly, least ouercome with the extreame of my griefe, I chance to say with my tongue, what my heart will repent, or vse my hands with such rigor as becommeth not a Mayden. The Gentlewomen seeing the wind blow so warme, fearing as much as was promised, seeing the Princesse impatience such, thought not good to tempt her aboue her strength for women being by nature warme with a little fewell wil be made hote, past reason: wherefore making a preamble to her discourse, like an eloquent Orator began thus. ( Pheander ) with that word, making a long pause, to note the Princesse countenance, on the suddaine naming her beloued, was interrupted thus: Pheander, Guenela ? what franticke humor causeth thee to name him in this manner, with whom thou haddest neuer any thing to say. Madame, quoth Guenela , attend the rest, before you either condemne me, or commend me. Then proceed quoth the Princesse. This Pheander , of whom my tale is before your Excellence to be told, is that Knight, who of your Maiestie is called the Mayden knight : this knight as it is told me, loueth a Lady, but whom I cannot declare, before I know: but as it is told me by his deare friend which knoweth the secrets of his hart, so tormented is he in his passions, that the night naturally made for rest, (restlesse) he consumeth in great discontent (the day) wherein all creatures delight, is vnto him loathsome, so that through watching, and refusing his diet, with other cares which cloyeth his stomacke, his louely face is altered from the sanguine, vnto the yellow coloured Safforne, (yea Madame) these mine eyes are witnesses of it, who this day saw him passe into the Court so feeble, that his weake legges might hardly endure the waight of his bodie. No more of this, my sweet Guenela , least thy tongue busied too long on this Tragedy, ouercome with the extremity of my griefe, I bee enforced to seeke an end of my torments, by dispatching my owne life. Oh Guenela , is this thy comfortable confection? Is this the reliefe thou preachest of, which would yeeld mee such quiet of minde? Unhappy Lady, why should I liue to see another enioy my loue? Is not Pheander my seruant: haue I not made choyse of him, and shall another, no way worthy to enioy him, haue that interest which might delight the Goddesses? Peace Nutania , whether comest thou, let reason subdue rage, let not euerie one knowe thy loue to Pheander , but conceale it as thou mayest, & seeke some secret deuise to giue thy heart ease, by death which is thy best remedie, yet would I liue to become a succour for the well deseruing Knight, and gaine his hearts desire for him if I might. Cruell were that Dame, and not worthie to enioy the simplest groome, which causlesse for loue, consumeth such a man in all perfections and liniaments of body, as Pheander , without yeelding him loue. But hearken Guenela , that thou maist in time when my body shall be entombed among the dead, report vnto my Loue (and louing Knight) how dear I held his loue, as my countenance often shewed, (though he) carelesse of loues toyes neuer regard it, for hee shall well know at my last end how I wish his welfare, doe but this for me, by his friend to learne the Ladies name whome the knight is so inthralled. This is all the seruice that I wil euer commaund thee, that knowing her, I may become an intercessor for him, whom my heart more desireth then all the worlds possessions: with this, teares which trickled downe from her eyes, restrained her tongue. In which sorrowfull, passion, her Mayden became a partner, and grieued for her felly, committing so hainous a fault in procuring the same, shee excused in this manner. Most gracious Princesse, how much I grieue to see you discomforted, I canot say, but hope your Grace will pardon mee which haue beene more bold (presuming on your fauor) then beseemeth me, neither what I haue done (gracious Lady) was of any intent to offend you, but to acquite my selfe of blame, in a matter of curtesie which I haue vndertaken, as the sequell shall manifest, if it shall please your Ladishippe to peruse this letter, which will no doubt, resolue you, without further paines to me, or trouble to your Grace, what shee is that is best beloued of the Maiden knight, on the earth. This letter I receiued at his hands, who hearing of your disquiet, desirous (as it should seeme) to acknowledge his dutie to you, coniured me by many fayre words, and proffers of good, to deliuer it vnto your hands, which albeit for modesty I did long refuse, thrusting that from mee with my finger, which I would willingly haue drawne to mee with all my force: In the end I consented, and the rather for your Ladiships quiet, which I suppose, will bid it welcome for the Masters sake: who, if my iudgement in the Planet Venus deceiue mee not, will proue shortly a coniunction, or ile neuer trust my skill againe: for Venus being in the Signe Leo , hath dominion ouer both houses, viz. hee and shee, or he and you. The Princesse at her last shift: when she heard Guenelas tale, voide of all hope to enioy her beloued Pheander , after she had a while paused, as one at length awaked from her memento , as from a sleepe she saith: Now trust me wench, thou hast cunninglie gon about the bush, and hast daintily sought to enter into my deepest secrets, yet how cunningly soeuer you haue dealt, there may bee a quility to deceiue both thee & him: but I pray thee Guenela , tell me what speeches vsed the Mayden Knight at the deliuery thereof, tell mee sweet gyrle in friendship. The dispayring knight (good Madam) for so I must call him, how euer his valour shewes it selfe in field, as no doubt worthily, so sayth report: yet in loue. I see his dastardnesse, who loueth, yet dare not reueale the sum of his desires, but must commit it to a tell-tale paper, languishing to the death, wanting his delight, and prolonging his sorrows by silence: his looks bewraying more then he can vtter: for bee it sayde, hee that had seene not long since his beautie and gallant grace, the ability of his body, and noted euery particular, lineament, at this time with the debility thereof, should see a Metamorphosis which might moue the most hardiest heart to pittie, the cause to mee vnknowne, but suspected. The assurance, I doubt not but your Grace will soone vnderstand if you vouchsafe to teare the Seale, and to reade the contents. The Princesse, which thought euery minute a yeare, till shee had knowledge of the Knights mind, put her Mayden from her prattle with a fayned message, when beeing all alone, with a number of sorrowfull sighes for the Knightes perplexity, shee read, and many times read those lines, which gaue her first comfort of enioying her hearts content: how welcome they are vnto her, it may better bee imagined then explaned, whose head was wholly busied in answering the same, for which shee thought it not vnfit to vse the help of Guenela , wherefore resting from her former studies, wee leaue her contemplating on her loue till Guenela her return: who seeing her Ladies colour somewhat reuiued, beganne to smile. Madame (quoth she) though I made a fault in detaining so long the Physicke that I promised you, yet I hope your Maiestie will pardon that offence, considering the good it doth in working, how you disgest it I know not, but hee that hath least skill in iudging complexions, will say your marriage is mended by twenty in the hundred, if you recouer but so much of your losse euery two dayes, there are few (in one weeke) will belieue you haue beene sicke. Well wanton well (answered the Princesse) you haue beene pretily disposed to play your part, and take your pastime in beholding the folly of both our loues, which I am the more willing to forget in that thou hast so rightly iudged of both our griefes. But leauing iest, I pray thee say my sweet Guenela , what said my seruant, when he deliuered these letters vnto thee Madam to say truth, nothing touching his loue, but imported with such earnestnesse, for the presenting them vnto your hands; as might haue made many proud to doe so charitable a deed crauing it with speech so pittifull, and lookes so ruthefull: for mine owne part, my heart imagining by your affection, that the Gods which caused your griefe, hath fettered him, and well knowing where Loue is vnited, the ones weale is the others good, though I were hardly wonne to the same, I vndertooke the hazard of your good will, promising to return to him an anwere thereof, wherein I shall breake promise, without you grant your consent. Oh Guenela , doubts thou of my consent, for answering of his kinde Letters, which haue endured so many nightes of vnrest, and carefull dayes for his sake? No, heauens neuer graunt mee good in this world, if I seeke not his content and that with so good loue and affection, as hee offereth his loue and seruice to mee: vnkind were I else, that louing, am beloued should suffer my dearest loue to lanquish, who may remedie it. Therefore Guenela , as thou hast playd the Aduocate, so make I thee my principall and chiefe Secretarie: peruse those lines, and in right consider if that his grief deserue not to be pittied, then let mee see thy skill in enditing, to the which thou shalt haue my helpe. Delay the time no longer, Hunger (my Wench) is sharpe sawce, (as those say which haue good stomackes) and I measuring his desires by mine owne, imagine that meate cannot bee more pleasing to the hungrie, then the vnexpected tidinges of consent from his new acknowledged loue, Soft fire, Madam, quoth Guenela , makes the sweetest Maulte, say our Huswiues: your Ladiship is farre wide: what, no sooner at the Stile, but ouer, haste makes waste: looke before you leape, least a blocke vnthought off, chaunce to breake your shins. What if these letters impart his loue, how are you assured thereof? Men are subtill, and can cast many colours to deceiue women, all is not golde that glistereth, nor all sugar that hath a sweet taste, vnder the greenest grasse lurketh the poysoned Adder, the Crocodile sheddeth most teares when hee seeketh most to deuoure: trie ere you trust, madam repentance comes too late: therefore howsoeuer you affect him, conceale it: Lightly wonne is as lightly lost. The Labourer that gaineth his money by hard labour, is more chary in parting therewith, then the purloyning thiefe, or the riotous youth, which by subtill practises draweth all hee can from his kind Parents, to maintaine his inordinate expenses. Let him bite on the Bridle a little, yet gently line his curbe that hee gall not (a little thing pleaseth a childe) and good countenance is worth golde, to him that regardeth it, as he prosesseth. Weigh your owne estate, which are heire to this most famous Crowne of Thrace , with ye basenesse of his calling, which was no better then a Marchant: Consider what a corrosiue this loue of yours would be to your honorable Father, should he know it, and how your Nobles would stomacke him for his byrth, grieuing to liue in obedience to one so farre their inferiour. The enuious regard not what vertues hee is possest with, which I must needes say, deserue to be accounted: the man gaining honour by vertue and valour, is more worthie to gouerne the State then the Noble, which ignobleth his house by his bad demeanonr. How many such there be in this Court, I grieue to see, who liuing licentiouslie, abuse themselues in such odious manner, that if your Ladyship heard the pittifull complaints of the Comons, crying out of the Prince for iustice against them, and how by fauor of their friends (ruling both the King and State) they are suborned, cleared of the crime, and the poore complainant, returned with a checke, able to breake the heart of a simple mae: abuses which may be more lamented then easilie remdied. But touching the Maiden Knight , from whom I haue digrest, I speake not any thing to disparage his loue, nor to draw your liking from the Knight, but with you temper your affection in such sort, that you may long enioy it, with content to you both, and so gouerne your Graces looks and countenances, that the lightnes of the one, nor the liberall bestowing of the other, giue iealous heads any cause of suspition. For Princes are great markes, and haue many eyes beholding them, and once perceiued, what perill it may procure to either part, your wisedome can conceiue. Thus in dutie haue I spoken, and deliuered a grosse aduise, which I referre to your Graces better consideration. Well hast thou said, my Guenela , quoth the Princesse, but what auaileth counsell to a desperate minde? No more then he that seeketh to quench the flame, powreth Oyle to it. I finde thy loue so great towards me, that I cannot requite it, which with such good regard balanceth each perill incident to both our states, if thou canst as well deuise how we may enioy our delight, without which we perplexed, canot long endure, what is it yt Nutania shal euer enioy but Guenela shall commaund? Then as thou tenderest my good, bethinke thee of some remedie, for my loue to him is such, as nothing may extinguish. Say my sweet Guenela , shall I by wryting answer his Letters, or no? In this I wil be ruled by thee, how gladly soeuer I wish his comfort, in whom, of all earthly creatures, cosisteth my most comfort, Experience is the best wisedome quoth Guenela , who would euer haue belieued Loues power to be of such effect, how impetious soeuer hee seemed, had they not seene & heard what I do? through which I am copelled to recant my heresie, & say, Loue is a God, or how is it possible he could command Princes? But to your Graces request, wheras you haue referred the answer of Pheanders Letters to me, I was neuer so voyd of reason, nor so desirous to be counsellor to your Excellence, to take so great a matter vpon mee, yet shall I (if so please it you to heare me) deliuer my simple opinion, as I would doe my selfe in the like action. The old wiues say, they that feede with the diuell must haue a long spoone: and they that goe about to maister Loue, had neede of many good precepts: diswade your Grace I will not so forget it, for I see it is vaine, neither would I wish you to answer by writing: for a paper is soone lost, and lost, to whose finding it shall come, t'is vncertaine: as seene to some enuious enemie, as a wel willer, in which some word simplie meant of you, or me, may be constructed by them at their pleasure, whereby your name may be brought in question: and a slaunder raised, is not so easilie suppressed, wryting is a specialtie, whereof the subtill Lawyer takes no small aduantage: to auoyde all which casualties, this may you doe: pretend some matter of conference with him, and appoint the time when he shall attend your pleasure at your lodging, comming secretly vnto you, and at such time as the King your Father shal be imployed in serious affaires, so may you vse your speech at your pleasure: This would Guenela doe, your Grace may vse your discretion. I like thy deuise well (good Wench) and giue thee manie thankes (qd the Princesse) therefore faile not to meete him for thy promise, what else, I referre to thy best iudgement. Now in faith Madame (qd Guenela ) you haue made a good choice for a solliciter, but take me as I am, this is the first suit that euer I was retained for: nor I doubt not (if I speede well now) of many Clyantes. As they were thus pleasant betweene themselues, they heard a Trumpet sound to horse, which caused the Princesse to sende her Page to enquire the cause, who returned her answere, ye the King with his traine, were setting forward to hunt a wild Bore, which his Forrester had rowsed: This newes gaue them cause of ioy, hoping that Fortune fauoured them with a happie time, which they were both loth to omit, doubting the like opportunitie: the Princesse especially, who could not be quieted in minde, vntill she heard her Knight answere for himselfe: Wherefore a Page was presently commaunded to search for the Knight, willing him with such conuenient speede as he could, to meet Guenela in the Garden: the Page vsed such diligence, that soone he was brought vnto the Knights presence, whome hee found solitarie (as a holie father) at his Orizons, whome the Page awaked with his ioyfull message, which was welcom vnto him, albeit doubtfull (whether of weale or woe) either to augment his sorrowes, or vtterly to extinguish them. The sudden hearing of which, caused him to pause a while, when hauing determined, curteously returned answer to the Gentlewoman, that he would attend her, he rewarded the Page so bountifully, as hee had cause to boast him of his well employed seruice. Guenela hauing receiued his answere by the Page, aduertized the Princesse thereof, who commanded her to haste, least she gaue the Knight cause of discontent by her long stay: but for all her speed Pheander was long there before, attending her comming: who was no sooner of him perceiued to enter the place, but his heart presaging some good, was more delighted thereat, then all the motions that could bee imagined, after his curteous salutations done, thus saide. How the Mayden Knight was brought to the Princesse presence by Guenela, their loues being discouered, a consent was of both parties agreed vpon to loue, the Knight discouereth himselfe to the Princesse: vnto whome hee vnfoldeth all his loue, with the originall proceedings. Sweete Guenela , I know not what to imagine of thy sudden message, yet willing to be resolued, as one that by thy answere expecteth his doome, either of life or death, I attend thy pleasure: say therefore, sweet Ladie, what saith the Princesse to my Letters? with whom Guenela purposed to bee something pleasant, and not to cloy his stomacke with such pleasant confections, that he should surfet therewith, and framing a countenance to her speech, she said. Syr Knight, of all the Gentlemen in the Court of Thrace , my good opinion was such of you, that on your word, I durst haue hazarded my greatest credit, which expectation thou hast farre deceiued, and therefore not worthie to be accounted among such honorable men at Armes, which take their principall honour, holding their words with Gentlewomen. At the deliuerie of which speech, hee that had tooke regard to the Knights countenace, might haue thought him past Phisickes recure: And withall, standing so mute, it verilie perswaded Guenela , that he was readie to deliuer his interest of life, which made her alter her rough words, and with a smoother methode new file them; doubting that her Comedie begun in myrth, should prooue a Tragedie, to the great griefe of the whole Countrey, which generally honored him. Wherefore taking him by the hand, she said: Syr Knight, I am sorrie I haue charged you so farre, what cause soeuer I had, but tis womanlike to be slaine with words, and no fit passion, for a man of your profession. That you may comfort yourselfe, I first pardon the offence against me committed, (and enioyne you) as you tender your credite with the Princesse Nutania , that you faile not to repaire at such conuenient time as you best can, vnto her lodging: where if you holde your word, you will excuse your Messenger. Oh Guenela , how haue thy speeches tormented me filling mine entrals with such confusion of comfortlesse thoughtes, as haue ouercome my sences? Yet Guenela , if thou be curteous, or haue any sparke of gentilitie abide in thee: Say my good Lady, what countenance gaue the Princesse to my bashfull paper? Vouchsafed she the reading of them? (Or how) to discomfort you good Knight, quoth Guenela , it were pitty, being already at so lowe a Datum , which pittieth mee to beholde. Comfort can I giue none to thy desires but this, thy sute is Loue, as your Letters import, in which dispaire not: for thy Mistresse is a woman, though a Princesse, and how pittifull our Sexe is, I will not boast, but wish thee not dispayre: If thy Birth were as great as thy vertues, thou mightest boorde and bed, as good as the Princesse Nutania , vnto whom I will be a faithfull soliciter. Mistake mee not Pheander , I speake as a friend, and so leaue thee, vntill thy comming to my Lady which detract not, fortune lost, is such a precious thing, as can neuer ve recalled. Before whome, when thou shalt come, pleade thine owne cause, and discouer thine owne griefe, And so farewell. Pheander , which had some greater hope by Guenela , her last speeches, was so ouerioyed, that he could not bid her farewell, yet after his memento past, he sayth: farewel the faithfullest friend in my distresse, that euer I found, Oh ( Guenela , happy mayest thou be in thy loues, and highly honoured amongst men, by whom my cares are thus comforted (faithfull Guenela ) the worker of my harts happy content by who past all hope, I am by thy faithfulnesse and truth in deliuering my message, freede of so heauy burthen, as was likelie to haue torne my poore oppressed hart in a millio of pieces: Thus applauding Guenela , he had almost forgotte his word Leauing further to descant on this plaine-song, returne we to the Princesse, who was aduertised by her Gentlew: what had passed betweene the Knight and her, not omitting his heauy lookes, and pittifull speeches. And then againe, as glad to please the Princesse, whom she was assured loued the Knight, letted not at large to set out his honours gained, his comlines of person, bountie, and whatsoeuer the world admired in him, she highly aduanced: to the great content of the Princesse, who thought euery minute a yeare vntill shee saw him, whom she with hearty desire expected, (long looked for, comes at last.) And Nutania , who at a casement waited diligently his comming, espied her beloued Knight, what ioy it caused, let them iudge, which better experience hath made perfit in louers delights. The Princesse hauing the sight of her so long desired Knight, sent Gueuela to entertain him, and to bring him to her presence. The Princesse studying to frame her countenance for his welcome, bethought herself of sundrie means, eftsoones, doubting by her too pleasant & kind vsage, to be thoght too forward in loue: then what discomfort her heauy lookes might moue to him, whom she most desired to please. In this quandarie sitting on a Pallet, leaning her head on her pillow, Guenela hath brought the Knight to her presece, who doing his duty, was by the Prince again saluted. Attending like the guilty condemned his sentence fro her mouth, which was to giue him either life or death, the knight thus at an non plus , ouercom with the beholding of the princesse excellent perfection, was by her the myrrour of al honor and curtesie remoued out of his dumps in this manner. Syr Pheander , whether I should chastice thy presumptio in writing so boldly vnto me (or no) I am not yet resolued, but before I acquainted my Father therewith, I thoght good to heare thee speake, for that I would not suddenly disgrace thee whom I haue so often graced, as well to heare thy meet comitting so great a folly, as what yu canst say in excuse therof. Princes are not to be iested with, nor to bee attempted in such maner by their inferiors, & therefore thou hast highly erred in that thou hast done, & incurred the danger of our strictest lawes, by which yu art already condemned, were thy fact known. The Knight standing at the Bar, where Beautie sate chiefe Iudge, was surprized with so many griefes, that he might hardly vtter any word, yet reuiued by hope of those comfortable words pronounced by Guenela , he sayth: Gracious Lady, that I haue presumed farre, I cannot but acknowledge, yet that I haue incurred such punishment as your Highnesse inferreth, I denie, vnlesse death be ye guerdon assigned for the faithfull: (for dutifull seruice) and entire affection vrged me to seeke thy fauour in loue, without which I may not liue: so deepely is thy vertuous perfections imprinted in my heart, which if I enioy not, I desire no longer to breath. Therefore Madame, if thou disdaine his loue, ye liuing dieth continually for thee: doe but say the word, and this blade so often imbrued in the blood of mine enemies shal sacrifice his masters owne true hart before thy face, that thy cruell selfe (maiest witnes to thy selfe) how faithfully thy seruant hath loued thee. The Princesse grieued to heare these speeches, moued with great ruth, could hardly forbeare shedding of teares, yet modesty the ornament of womankind, caused her to fain a couterfeit show of displeasure to him, whose tears wrung drops of blood from her tender hart, yet that she might not so suddenly confesse her harts desire, nor giue him cause of vtter dispaire she saith: Pheander , that thou mayest see, and seeing reporte in all places where euer thou shalt become of Womens pitty I graunt thee pardon for thy fault, and with my pardon thy life, which was wholly in mee to dispose. For louing me as thy Prince, I hartily thanke thee, but in seeking to obtaine my loue as thy wife, that haue been denied to diuers and sundry Princesse, in that thou errest, let each estate frame themselues in loue, to their equals, so shall they sooner obtaine their desires, and their loues in more tranquility be maintained. Thou knowest thy birth how base it is, and though for thy vertues it pleased my Princely Father to aduance thee, who cannot of his Princely Nature, but reward the defects of the well deseruing. If for his good to thee thou seeke to robbe him of his child, therein thou shewest a very vngratefull mind, and layest open vnto the World thy base condition. Therefore persist to prosecute thy sute, let reason vanquish that brain-sicke humor which so afflicts thee, in doing which thou shalt shew thy Loue to be thy self: For no greater conquest can be atchieued, then conquering a mans own effects. Doe this and thou shalt finde Nutania thy faithful and assured friend, who will be as carefull to aduance thee, as I haue found thee ready to pleasure me. Alas, good Madam (answered the Kn.) I haue ofte heard, the whole needs no Physition, it is easier farre to giue counsell then to take it. The full gored Churle little regarding ye staruing creature at his gate, but (Madame) could you conceiue the least part of many thousand griefes that afflict me, you would pitty me at least, thogh you yeelded me no farther fauor: If thy hart be not harder then the Adament (pitty me) sweet Lady, & yeeld thy grace to augment my life, or vtterlie denie me your fauour for euer. I expect but your answere, for my resolution is no other then I haue profest (dastards feare to die) but the Noble mind preferreth death which endeth all sorrows, before a life be continued wt discontent. The Princesse which was at her wits end, as full of griefe, as he of sorrow, turned her speeches from her matter, to question him of his Countrey, the maner of the Court and state thereof, thinking so to haue beguilde the time, & put him off for the season. But so long dallied we, that she was forced in the end to confesse her loue to be no way inferior to his. Thus as I haue said, demaunding of the Knight many questions, she intreated him to resolue her, whether the Prince Dionisius were such as the world reported him: who had name to be a Paragon, excelling in all actions required in a Nobleman. The Prince hearing his name called in question by the Princesse on a suddain, belieued verily, that she had some secret knowledge of him, which made him with blushing cheekes to say, what reports so euer your Grace hath heard of ye Prince Dionicius I know not, a subiect I was to his father, & ought to speak reueretly of him (yet what is truth) & not for affectio or despight, to say other then I will with my blood auouch. Wherfore Noble Ladie, I wil truly answere your demauds. The Prince, whose Father was matchlesse, gayning the loue of all men, with care and honor maintained the reputation of his Countrey, which by his carelesse sonne is blemished, who neglecting the dutie of a child, without regard of father, crowne, or kingdome, exiled himselfe, no man knowes where, or whether he rest aliue or no: since which time, the King his father, who loued him too deare (if fathers loue may be too deare) hath likewise absented himselfe, and liueth in exile. The mother Queene, hath resigned her due to death, leauing (by losse of those honourable persons) their countrey without a head, and their state by subiects to be gouerned, whereby a ruine of the kingdome is like to ensue, all proceeding from the Prince. A miserable countrey is that (quoth the Princesse) and to be lamented: but more the losse of so noble dance, the father hauing bene such, and the sonne as (report saith) so toward. But say (good Knight) quoth she, was there neuer cause supposed of their departures? nor did not the father through his harsh demeanor, for youth in these times take vnkindly their fathers vnkindnes: and age is froward, which frowardnes might minister great cause of discontent. Madam (quoth the Knight) to my knowledge, this I will say, my father being a Courtier in some regard, where by I came familiar with the Prince, and as youth will make choise of some one to participate with, so it pleased ye Prince louing my father well, to vse my company in all his exercises through which I saw his demeanour, with such reuerent dutie to the King acknowledged, and as kindly requited of the King, as on the earth might be found loue more perfect till his speech fayling in his mouth, he could vtter no more. The Princesse giuing heed to each word by him pronounced, albeit she saw the repeating of the Princes life, was somewhat cumbersome vnto him, yet ceased he not to vrge him, to shew such sorow in deliuering the storie so of her desired. Ah Madam (quoth the knight) at his departure, began our Countries grief and my sorrow, from whom in life, I could neuer be seperated, such was my loue to him, which refused himselfe, his Crowne, and dignities. A dolefull tale hast thou deliuered (quoth the Princesse) which I perceiue mooueth you to impatience, wherefore, and demaund and an ende. The Prince Dionisius , made choyse of you, for his companion: Then vnder benedicitie let me craue (al law of friendship exempted) did he not acquaint you with his determinations? for me thinkes it is scant credible, that such an vnitie should be amongst men, their loues being so perfect, but hee should disclose each secret intent whatsoeuer: many reasons draweth me to suppose it, which I will omit, for I perceiue I am too tedious. Your Ladiship vrgeth me farre, yet will I accomplish your request, who haue power to commaund me. The Gentleman who neuer offended, but in committing of this great offence, long before his departure, hauing belike some motion of desire in his thoughts, became of a pleasant Gentleman, the most melancholiest that could be found, that quite abolishing all company, he best contented himselfe with his secret cogitations: continuing this sorrow so long, that he fell sicke of an extreame Feuer: which so encreased vpon him, as all Physickes reliefe was quite giuen ouer: so that small was the hope of his recouerie, whose distresse, the kind King, with the mother Queene, grieued in such wise to behold, as in short time it was hard to be iudged which of the three endured most extreames. But God in that aduersitie sends comfort, restored the Prince to some strength: belike receiuing some comfort in his imaginations, and by his recouerie, the King and Queene were both so comforted, as in short time they were raised from their sicke cabinets, to frolike it amongst their noble subiects, who ioyed in nothing so much as in their healthes. But how soone the Sunshine of their happinesse was ouershadowed with clouds of comfortlesse care, grieueth me to recount: yet dare I not gainesay your Ladiships request. The Prince recouered of his maladie, made semblance of such content, that none but himselfe could witnesse by the least suspition, his hearts discontent, yet oftentimes should I, being seldome from his companie, sighing with a number of farre fetched sobs, heare him say, Peerlesse Ladie, would my loue were as well knowne to thee as to mine owne heart, then doubtles wouldst thou pittie me which languish for thee, that art the onely Princesse on the earth, excelling in all vertues which beautifie the honorable, the report of which hath fettered my fancies to thee, that I protest to be thine, or neuer mine owne: then looking with a gastly looke about him, to see if any ouerheard him, he wold fall into some other discourse, euer applauding the rare perfections of his Mistresse, who was vnknowne to all but only to himselfe and I, who from the first he acquainted with ye same: briefly Lady, (for I weary you with my discourse) the loue of his Lady hath drawn him fro his countrey, whose absence caused the kings exile, and the Queenes death. The Princesse hearing all these extreames to grow from affection, knowing well her owne hearts discontent, with a sigh from the deepest which wrung teares from her heart, she said, Alasse noble Gentleman, whose ioye so soone ouerwhelmed, hath heaped so many cares vpon mee, what folly was there in thee, that wouldst not disclose thy loue which burned so vehemently: was the Dame so base that thou fearest therby to ignoble thy issue, or of such high estate, thou doubtest to obtaine her: if eyther, by perswasions all griefes might haue been mitigated of a Monarch, why thou by report deseruest her, if a begger thou mightest make her noble, what ere shee were, hearing thy distresse, could shee forbeare to pitty thee? No, no, were her heart more harder then the Diamond, it could not chuse at the hearing thereof, but relent: else, well worthy were she to be scorned of all Ladies and neuer to bee named amongst the number of Women. The Prince seeing the Princesse in this pittifull humor, thought it good striking when the yron was hot, & taking the opportunity, answered her thus: Is your Ladiships censure of such hard hearted Ladies, & will not be entreated of him, whose loue to you, is no whit inferior to the Prince Dionicius , as himselfe would confesse were he present, & heard mee recount the many griefes wherewith loue hath afflicted mee: and might he be iudge, would allow mee recompence for my seruice in loue. But Madam, if without offence I might demaund this say Nutania , the Princesse of Thrace , were the Saint vnto whome this vnhappy Prince had vowed his deuotions, and that all the passions he hath endured, are for your loue, would you vouchsafe him loue in recompence thereof? The Princesse driuen to her shifts at this demaund, could not tell what to answere, yet sharpening her wittes (as women can doe) she said: Pheander , Loue is not to be dallied with, as I haue heard them say, which speake by experience: therefore I cannot directly answere thy question but were I the Physitian that could cure his maladie, and had so good iudgement of his affects as of wine owne, charitie would I should minister vnto his disease, what effect soeuer the potion would worke? prouided this, that hee disclosed his griefe in time: mistake me not Pheander , and pardon me if I conceale what I would vtter, my thoughts are mine owne. Truth Ladie (quoth the Knight) neither was the same demaunded to vrge any thing more then standeth with your good liking: yet for the Prince, this I say, it were pittie he should die for loue. So say I, (quoth the Princesse) for few men there be of that condition, and as seldome is such a one seene, as multitudes of blacke Swans. Your errour is great. Madam, (quoth the Knight) for many haue bene with loue so ouercome, that Kings haue bene enforced to stoope to their subiects, and the greatest conquerours, whose valour many volumes record, by loue compelled to forsake themselues, taking sundrie shapes and many toyles, to gaine the loue of their Ladies, I speake now Madam for the Prince, whom I loue well, and challenge your charitie may be to him continued, for your loue is the onely Physicke that must cure him, or else all other helpes are friuolous: in hope whereof, hee breaths a lingring life, till your gracious consent finish his griefes, yeelding to his desires, in whom it resteth, to restore him: banished to his regall dignities, who is the cause of his exile: dastardnesse hath caused him to conceale it, bearing the extremitie of his passions with intollerable paine, whose flames encrease by viewing your excellent perfactions: The want of whose grace, haleth him on to desperation, not able any longer to resist loues assaults, which with such hot allarmes assaileth him, that longer he cannot endure them. The Princesse hearing her Knight pleade for the Prince with such earnestnes, leauing his owne sute to draw her to loue him of whom her thoughts were least on, thought it some policie of the Knight, which imagined loue had vanquished her, swelling with anger at these new imaginations, her colour changed into so many formes, that the least Child which had seene the same, might easily haue guest what small content those last vttered speeches wrought. But doubting least with silence it should be perceyued, with a heart full fraught with fury, she said, Deceitfull wretch, vnworthy the fauour of the simplest drug, that by thy subtill practises hast sought to insinuate thy selfe into my secrets, was it not false varlet sufficient that I forbeare the punishing of thy owne bolde writings, but to my face in colourable manner, deludest mee with tales of I know not what. Haue, I euer graced thee since I first saw thee, and requitest thou my fauour thus, dallying with me, as with thy inferiour, or some of thy base Trulles? No, no, vse thy iest with such that can better disgest them, and from henceforth bee warned, (and warned) take heed how thou dare eyther by word or writing, vse any like motions, least I acquaint the world with thy impotent dealings, and by death thou receiue the guerdon of thy ill: and so farre as thou maist, for neuer expect farther fauour at my hands. The Prince hearing this finitiue sentence from her whose tongue was to pronounce his life or death, thought it high time to speake for himselfe before shee departed, and staying her as she would haue gone, he humbly besought her, not in displeasure to leaue him, but with patience endure what he could say, which albeit she might hardly be wonn to grant, yet her former affection banished chollor in such wise, that he had liberty to speake, saying. Gracious Lady, that I offended your Excellence, whom of all earthly creatures I most honour, I heartilie sorry for it iudge me not so impudent or senseles, to moue matter without some reason, especially enduced thereunto by your excellent fauour, and charitable pittie of the wretched estate of that vnhappy Prince, who hath vowed to loue your grace to the death: and by granting him your loue, you shall draw him from death, and thereby not onely restore him, but fill the harts of manie thousands with ioy which with teares continually lamenteth his losse, which is lost to them for euer, and shortly will be losse to himselfe and the whole world Unhappy Prince, why name I him Prince, whose miseries is more then the most wretched slaue that liueth, who not able to endure the force of loue, hath forsaken himselfe, to follow his owne affections, without knowledge of father, king or subiects. Muse not Madam, at the strangenesse of the Tale I haue to deliuer, nor let it seeme incredible that I am that vnhappie Dionicius , lawfull heyre to the Numedian Crowne, that Prince, through whom so many miseries is befallen his Country, his fathers care, and cause of his carefull mothers vntimely death, who fettred in loues bands, by report of thy peereles beauty and vertues hath drawne me to take the habit of a Marchant, vsurping the name of Pheander , the more vnsuspected to attaine the sight of thee, whom my heart so desired: whom if thou pitty, liueth by thy loue to doe the honour, and without thee, may no longer enioy this life, in pursuit of whose loue, if I die, my ghost among the rest of louers shall sing hymnes in laud of thy peerelesse beauty. The Princesse as one in a trance, could not tell whether shee heard him speake, or dreamed, yet noting his countenace which she wed a troubled spirit, tickled with a suddaine ioy, as women bee proud in their Louers, that he loue to Pheander was metamorphosed to Dionicius ye Numedian prince, of whom her Fathers Courtiers reported such Honours, shee sayd, Pheander , or how I shall call thee I know not, thou hast filled my sences with a world of cofused thoughts, in recounting the strangenesse of thy Fortunes, which I can hardly be drawne to belieue, nor is it possible that the Prince Dionicius could liue in the Court of Thrace so long concealed: without knowledge of some one, if I might by reason bee induced to belieue the same, I would say more. Madam quoth the Prince, howsoeuer I haue disguised my selfe heretofore, as loath to be dishonoured, yet beleeue mee in this, that I said no more then is truth. Therefore if thou couldst not loue Pheander being a Marchant, for ignobling thy noble house, yet as I am the Prince of Numedia , vouchsafe me thy liking, by whom thy honour can no way bee disparaged, but by exchanging loue for loue with him, aduance thy honour far higher. Say now Madam, all nicenesse set apart, can you loue? The Princesse, whose loue was equall, though willingly she would haue coloured the same, yet mooued with a pittifull desire to ease his griefe, which farre surpassed, as also to ease her owne heart, which was not a little infected with the selfe disease: their welfares depending both on her grant or deniall. After shee had deliberated a while, fixing her hand in his, which shee easily grasped, and leaning her heade on his shoulder to couer the blushing of her face, as ashamed of what she had to say vnto him, in reuealing her owne griefe, shee sayd. Famous Prince, whom the World applaudeth, and our Courtiers of Thrace , with wonder to admire, that I loued thee being Pheander , I cannot denie, and how many iarrs I endured for thee, I omit: each particular wringing teares from my heart, which how willing soeuer it was to haue made the same knowne, modestie restrayned, laying before me many wrongs offered in Ladies Loue, by such periured Knights, as haue protest with their tongus, with their harts neuer ment, wherby diuers Ladies of honour haue been dishonoured, & sundry lost their liues (which considered) blame me not, if I rather chuse to die, then passe the handes of modestie so farre, as seeke thy loue, or knowing thy griefe, to blame mine, (yeelde) before I heard thee auow on thine honour, what thy letters imported. But gentle Prince, that thou maiest better belieue what I report, how much soeuer my heart hath denied to reueale, perswade thee, if I loued thee, being Pheander , and a counterfeit Marchant, assure you, I cannot hate thee for that thou art Dionicius (the one Prince) the other an inferiour, for whose loue were I assured, and that his tongue and heart agreed in one, Dionicius should be in loue so requited, as neuer any should haue interest in Nutanias heart, but the peerelesse Prince of Numedia At the vttering of which, teares restrained her speech, which ye Prince noted, and perceyuing that shee spake what her hart thought, he comforted her thus. Faint not Madam, neyther sorrow for those comfortable confections bestowed on a dying Creature, whose fauors hath haled him from the graue, whereunto hee was like to haue beene swallowed, had not thy comfort reclaimed me, who liuing dyed for thy loue, which grace shall neuer bee forgotten. And that you shall assure you my faith and loue is firme and honourable, I protest by that honour that euer the Numedian Prince hath regarded, that my loue to the Princesse Nutania is no other but honourable, nor euer none hath had any interest in Dionicius or euer shall, but the onely beautifull and vertuous Princesse Nutania : and on that, take here my hand, and with my hand the hart loue and hononr of a Prince. Guenela lending an eare to this prattle, hearing them in earnest to put them from their melancholy, tooke the word at aduantage, and comming suddenly to them said: Madam, at finishing of bargaines they shake hands, if there be any exchange between your knight and you, you were best to take witnesse, least disliking the match, he recant his word. Guenela quoth the Prince, your Lady is beholding to you for your care, (and I) your debter challenge it when you please. Sir quoth Guenela , I thank you, but writ please you remember your promise, and excuse Guenela (quoth the Princesse) without my Lord the Prince his further intreatie, I pardon all faults committed against me for confirmation of which, get your Lawyer to draw an acquittance general from the beginning of the the world, & I will signe it. Nay Madam (answered Guenela ) it were an euill seruant that will not take her Mistresse Word for a dozen or two of stripes, which I am sure had been then oft, and if they should light on my ribbes, might well grieue mee, slay me they could not, my heart is of more valour then so. But Madam, shall Syr Pheander marrie the Princesse Nutania that you call him your Lord the Prince? if that be the bargaine, I feare me there is some fire in the straw. And how then (qd. the Princesse?) Nay Madam qd. Guenela , nothing but I pray God giue you much ioy, and make you happy in your Loue. While they were thus pleasant, a Page brought word that diuers Ladies were come to visite the Princesse, which caused them, how loath soeuer, after many sweet embracings and louing kisses, betweene them interchanged, to giue each other the farewell, parting better content then they came together, hauing vnburthned their harts of many griefs giuing content to both, by yeelding to loue, which vanquished both whom to their pleasing imaginations I leaue, to recout the kings of Thrace & Thessaly , their pastimes in hunting. How the Kings of Thrace and Thessaly hunted with great delight, and what happened them, with a pleasant discourse of a simple Countryman, whom with his mother, the two Kings by chance met withall, with the Letters of the Clowne to his Loue, & complaint of his mother of wrongs done her by a man of State. These Kings following the Chace with great pleasure, as pastime they greatly delighted, were so wearied with ye same, and toyled with the extremitie of heat, which made them chuse some place vnder the shadow of the spreading trees to refresh themselues, where they had not long rested, but they were espied of an ancient woman, the widow of a good Yeoman, and her sonne, who hauing workmen not far from thence, were carrying them victuals. The poore aged woman hauing seene (as shee thought vnseene) the Kings, doubting they mere some of those robbers, that hanted those mountains would haue shifted from them another way, but were interrupted of the Kings, who suddenly calling them, draue them both into such shaking feare, as they which are ouerburthened with a feauer. The King who graciously regarded their timorousnes, comforted them with all the fauorable speeches he could vse, protesting vnto them, that in their company they shuld receiue no discurtisie, by none, if the king himselfe were present, and therefore willed them to set feare apart, & to tell them what they were, the cause of their feare, & their busines they had that way? These honorable speeches of the King mildely vttered, comforted them, wherefore in such blunt manner as her bringing vp required, she said. Gentlemen, for so you seeme, if your inward conditions, answere your outward habite, (as many in this age doth) whose garments might become men of great worth, if apparell may make a man more worthie, yet diuerse times couer those carkases, voyd either of worship, honesty, or other good condition. Pardon my harsh behauiour, (gentle Syr) and blame me not for auoyding the way, experience hath taught me to eschue harmes, who to my cost haue dearely payde for my learning, hauing my goods spoyled at home, and my selfe endangered abroad: and without offence may I speake it, by such, whose countenance and attire, might well haue deceiued them of more iudgement then my selfe. The King delighted with her plaine speeches, demaunded where she dwelled, and whether she had a husband, or liued as a widow? Oh sir, if any gentilnes abide in you (qd she) vrge me not to deliuer a tale of such a ruth, as your questios import. The remembrance of my passed pleasant life, when I call to minde, wt the cares I now am combred with, many sundrie wayes, are so displeasing vnto my grieued hart, as I may not without many teares shed, recount the same. These wordes spoken in heauinesse noted of the King, made him more importunate to heare the rest, and therefore willed her, all feare set a part, to reueale vnto him, what estate she liued in, and if any wrongs were offered her, hee protested by oathes which might haue bene well belieued, to remedie it yea, if it were the king himselfe. The carefull Widow encouraged by these comfortable words, albeit she hoped of small reliefe from him partly to ease her hart, and a little to disgrace her aduersarie, which was mightie, all the reuenge she could take, thus said: Syr, that I may not seeme discurteous to you, whose curtesie offered, is more the I can any way deserue, but in praier for your welfare, which pittieth a poore Wiodowes estate whose weal is the good of her poore fatherlesse Orphants, hear with pitty my case, & consider therof, as you shall best please. The drying her eyes which like gutters bedewed hir cheeks, she said, Not far fro hence (gentle sir) is my poor cabinet, wher this fifty winters I haue maintained the port of a poore woman, my husband delighting in hospitality, and on his death bed, gaue me charge to do the like, which I haue obserued, hurting non, nor neuer denying any good to them that sought to me: The needy I harbored, whom with my bread & such vyands as God sent, I haue fed. But now Syr, (qd. she) and therewithal, a deepe sigh witnes of her hearts heauines, restrained her speeches, yet after some pause, sayd, But now Sir, such is the oppression of the couetous in authority, that my liuing is taken from me, and I with my familie, compelled to seeke harbor where wee can get it, if God the comfort of the distressed, prouide not within three months for vs, longer we haue not there to abide. Tell me woman (qd. the King, what is hee that thus iniureth thee, and the manner how? and as I am a true subiect to the King, I will neuer leaue thee till thou art with iustice reuenged on him. Oh sir (quoth sh) vrge me no more to that for my aduersary being honorable, & of account with the king, althogh the wrong I sustaine be great, yet wil he reuenge himself on me & mine, as my life will be the least & last, such is his bloody mind, who hath neither conscience, nor thought of any good, else after so many yeeres of quiet possession of this tenement, in name of my husbands ancestrie, as our euidence doth specifie, hee would not thus extremely deale with those, whom charity wold he should cofort, but such is his crueltie, who ought to be curteous, that his auarice is neuer satisfied, haling al from the poore, and profiting none, but himselfe, his children or seruants, who reape the benefite of many mens labours, for what sute passeth, but such as he must like of? or what will the King denie, that he will graunt? Lamentable is it to heare the complaints of the commons, of all estates, how in secret they murmure: Nay, not onely against him but I may say, by others reports, that the Kings name is called in question of many, all proceeding of this cankar of men, who guiding all, abuseth all. The Souldier seruing for his Countreys honour wanteth his pay, which causeth him fall to robberie, and other vnlawfull exercises. The Farmer, Grasier, and such, that liue by the benefite of their Tillage, feeding Cattell, and other hard labours, haue their Cattell taken, their Corne, and what they enioy, and driuen to seeke their mony by long sutes, and in the ends glad to bestow the one halfe to be assured of the other, yet dare none complaine, how great soeuer the oppression be. Thus Syr, to satisfie you, I haue spoken the truth what I haue heard, and partly that I know, which I and many more may lament, but cannot remedie it. But Sir, what I haue spoken, I hope you will conceale, for if you be friend to him, whom I dare not name, yet you can imagine: If vnder your faire words lurke deceit, and that you haue sifted me to betray me to his crueltie, such ill befall thee, as I wish him, whom I haue cause to curse, and others with me, whome hee hath likewise wronged. But had the King knowledge how he vseth his subiects, especially his tenats (who is our good Landlord) and thus many yeares hath bene, hee would redresse it; but that he hauing the charge of all, hath receiued a great fine to thrust me from my right, which God remedie, and graunt our King to vnderstand his tyrannie. Amen, (qd the King) May it be possible that he (whom I know) the King hath loued so deere, and aduanced to such honor, should seeke his dishonor in so base manner? Well good woman (qd the King) that thou shalt know I fauour the cause, and sorrow for the wrongs offered the Comens, I will enforme the King what I haue heard, & thou shalt haue iustice, else neuer let me liue. Therefore see that three dayes hence thou fail not to come to the Court, vnto the Kings Porter deliuer this Signet, who vpon sight therof shal bring thee to my presence, in the mean time comfort thy selfe, & faile not to meet me at the appointed time. The aged Widow whose heart sorrow and feare had ouerburthened, doubtfull least her large speeches should haue caused her greater trouble, was by the King comforted, who she had no knowledge of, yet prayed God to preserue him in peace and much happinesse, and so would haue departed: but the King melancholy at these reports, willed her to stay, for that he would haue some speech with her sonne, which seemed very simple, shewing by his misdemeanour how he had bin brought vp. Wherefore to delight him, and to driue those melancholie dumpes away, he questioned him of his yeares, and bringing vp, and how he liued, whether a Batcheler, or married, which questions were answered with such simplenesse, as greatly delighted the King. As the Kings were thus pleasantly discoursing with him, it fortuned the King of Thrace to espie a paper in his bosom, which, for he seemed by his Inckehorne at his girdle, to bee a Clarke, perswaded themselues, that if it were not some reckoning or remembrance, it was some worthy worke which made the King require a sight therof, which how loth soeuer hee seemed, making often denials, it might not be accepted: after many perswasions, he pulled the same out, which was folded in the curiosest manner, cater-corned and subscribed. Why how now friend? this is suspitious, that in such secret manner (qd. the King) you carrie Letters, refusing to shewe them when they are required? it may be treason against the state, therefore I will by your leaue see it. Oh Gentleman, (quoth the yongling) in his clownish manner, if you can, I pray you let it alone, or at the least, if you reade it, let not my mother heare. For my life (quoth the King) it is some sounde stuffe, and matter worth the sport: wherefore tearing the Seale, which was as broad as a shilling, of the best blacke War the Cobler would bestow on him: they read the Contents thus; Honie Dania more sweeter then the finest Sugar, or the spiced wine, solde for eighteen pence the quart, of thy honesty being little, I say little, good Ale needs no signe, for such are thy vertues, that they shine ouer the whole Parish, like the Moone in her Eclipse: Cupine , I applaude thy dignities, by whose power my heart hath sworne loue in a fraile to thee, for which good turne, and that thou shalt the rather further my loue, I vow euerie Christmas day during the lease of my life, to carrie to thy chappell two halfepenie white loaues, and a pot of the best Ale, with the appurtenances, & to verifie my word to thee, I swear by my loues hand: so white as the b[illeg.]ed Rieloafe, neuer to faile, if it cost mee a fayre groat of siluer in recopence of which, as thou art a god, thou wilt cause Dania , who like a sneaking Wench hath stollen my heart, to ioyne issue with me, and loue mee with so good a zeale as I loue her, which I may sweetlie say (yea) & sweare it too, is with so good a hart as ere I plaid the Trewant from schoole. Oh Dania , be it knowne vnto thee by these presents, the inditement of my hart root, and the superscription of my shaking hand, that thou art the onelie ioy and delight of thy louing Zachary , who plungeth like a Packe horse in the mire ouer head end eares for thee, sowcing to the gulph of heartes griefe, as a Sowes face in the brine tub: yea, like as fire in the Brewers furnace I burne, and all for thee. Oh Dania , as thou art hansome and well fauoured, so be thou pittifull, and pull a handfull of cold loue from thy heart, to quench the flame, which like the great hill that burneth, consumeth me, so much, that as many as come within a smell of mee, stopping their noses for feare of infection, with a troubled voice say, Fie on the filthy wretch the cause of it: Thy loue my dear, is the cause. Thou art my iewel, my pearle, without thy loue nothing can be pleasing vnto me, by yeelding thereof a grant with consent and good liking, thou ouerburthnest my hart of sorrow, as one should vnrig a ship, but if thou denie, bestowing the same on some clowne my inferior, & nothing worthy to enioy thee so marmalade a lasse, my brading blade shal brech my side in such maner, that my puddings forsaking their habitation, my bellie shall be no more desirous of ye good white pot & bacon, wherwith it hath been so often filled. If thou be pittifull Dania , saue the life of a louing batcheler, and suddenlie let me know thy mind, or else farewell to thee, farewell to the world, yea, adue to all the braue lustie gallant youths of our parish: to whom so ofte I haue led the morish: to my eternall rebuke amongst al the Wenches, whose secret voices might be often heard to whisper these words of great comfort. (O excellent Zachary .) To recount all these, & more then memorie will giue me leaue to recount, farewell. By Ione-Iumper I vow, a fortnight I will not liue with out thee, but my body dying for thee, shall be by our Batchelers raggedlie intomb, where Loues champions are laid. To furnish my funerall, I bestowe my fallow Cow giuen me by that good old woman my Grandame, my faire sute of Russet, whereon I bestowed xiii. pence in dozen lace, made to delight thee, I bestow vpo my brother Nicke, let him wear it for my sake, that euerie holiday he puts it on, thou mayest remember me whom thou hast cast away, breaking out in some place thy sorrow for the same, ye the gods of loue reuege not my death, as on that trothles Cressida , for her Knight Trolila , for more true haue I been to thee, then the yuie to the oake, or the meat (within) to the egge shell. And the more my truth, the greater thy torment, if Clarks sayings may be belieued (who can tell) for they were all Wise men. I say no more because I cannot. But I wish to die, vnlesse thou grant, Therefore my Wench, looke not scant, For if thou doest it may thee grieue, When I am dead, that thou shouldst liue, To heare the Wenches which will say, Dania hath slaine her Zachary. Thus will thy name a by-word be, Mongst bad and good of each degree: Then kill not him so cruelly, That for thy sake hath sworn to die. Thine constant till Doomes day, faithfull Zachary. The King greatly pleased with this inuention, for that it ouercame his melancholy, willed him to say, whether he were so farre in loue as he profest? Am I, quoth Zachary (I that I am) and how and I be, doe you know Dania that you demaund such questions? Or wil you knowing my griefe, perswasion her from my loue? The King hearing him so earnest gaue the more credite to his words, willing him to keepe the matter secret to himselfe, and to come with his mother to the Court at his time appointed, against which, hee had by such secret espials as he procured, learned the truth of this Nobleman, and his iniurious dealings, which like a iust Prince he requited with death: and caused a Proclamation to be made, that whosoeuer they were, which could make proofe of their wrongs, should come by a day prefixed, where their cause should be heard, & restitution made, which in such sort was accomplished that his lands, leases, plate, & iewels, were distributed to the wronged. The widdow who first gaue notice thereof, the King inriched with greater possessions to maintaine her hospitality, and Zachary for that his Dania should not for want of wealth refuse him, he bountifully rewarded, so that euery one was pleased, and returned content to their homes. How the K. of Thrace furnished the Thessalian King with forces to recouer againe his Kingdome, of which the Mayden K. is Generall, with their Aduentures at Sea, and honourable Conquests by Land, with their victories. Now Gentiles, the historie shall shew you how Theophilus King of Thessalie expected the ayde of Thrace for restoring him to his Kingdom, which promise the King is regarded, that in short time, through the diligence of those captains, to whom the charge therof was comitted, the nuber appointed was furnished wt shipping, munitio, & victuals for the armie, of who the Thracian K. tooke the Muster, appointing their leaders. The chief by name of General, for the seruice, was the Mayden knight , who was vrged vnto it by the two kings, in such maner, that no excuses nor delayes which he could make, might be accepted, vnlesse hee should by his too much refusall, purchase the name of coward. This choyse greatly disliked the Knight, whose warres in loue, had but newly begunne to take successe, who scarsely assured of the Princesse, although her promised faith might put him in comfort, yet weighing the vnstabilitie of their sexe, he doubted least his absence might draw her to that which he would heedefully regard being present. The tidings of her Fathers election, made of her loue for Generall, as nouelties are rife and flyeth with swift wings, came vnto the hearing of the Princesse, vnto whom, if they were irkesome, suppose you, yt know how grieuous the parting of two faithfull louers are, who hauing her onely felicitie in contemplating of her beloued Dionicius , their ioyes but now in the blossomes, was so nipt in the spring, as care banished all future happinesse, & sorrow began to claime her wonted place in both, but especially the Princesse who framed of the weaker mould, heauinesse had taken the more impression in her, so that forsaking all company, her chiefest delight was to be solitarie, where she might with deepe sighes and many brinish tears, vnburthen her ouercharged heart, cursing bitterly the cause, and causer of separating her Loue. In this melancholy vttering such speech of dispayre: as though shee saw the dreadefull messenger Death already seized vpon the valiant knight: the knight who could take as little rest as his Lady pleasure, could find content in no place, vntill he came to the Princes lodging, whom found in this passion, which was more grieuous the all the rest, her blubbered eyes pressing blood from his heart, holding her in that plight, whose happy content was his onely ioy. But how combersome soeuer it was vnto him, with wisedome hee aduisedlie weighed, that cares must bee comforted in time, least taking deepe root, they wil consume the heart subiect vnto it. Therfore after many kind perswasions vsed, he laid before her, the honor of the place assigned him, and what infamie would redound vnto him, refusing with the dishonour of him, and staine to his Progenie for euer, the cause being right, and the action of her princely father so charitable, whereon the welfare of a whole kingdom consisted. The Princesse whom griefe had neare ouercome, hearing her beloued speake so honourablie, and well considering it was greatlie to his infamie, to denie her Father, though hardlie wonne to patience, yet armed with hope of his valour, and fortunate successe in his iourney, reason and wisedome subduing griefe and sorrow, shee graunteth her consent, heartilie praying for his safe and suddaine returne, to his eternall honour, and encreasing of the heares content. Time that staieth not, causeth these Princes to part Pheander to giue directions for his iourney, his prouision being all to make, but such care had hee of the same, as he was suddenly prouided of all needfull thinges, expecting a fayre wind for imbarking his Companies, which GOD sent as they desired, when each one taking leaue of their friendes, with many a loath departing farewell, he betooke himselfe to the merrie of the waues, who by his goodnesse, that commandeth and gouerneth al things, fauoured them with so happie a gale, that in short time they might descry the high land of Egypt , which being by his skilfull Pylottes knowne, they strooke their sayles to Hull , vntill a generall Councell was called, where euerie man had libertie to deliuer his aduise for the benefit of the action. Where after long debating, and ech perill aduisedly weighed, it was determined, the Fleete should bee put againe into the Sea; least they being a huge number should bee discryed, and their intent thereby made frustrate, To bring their purpose to better effect, a Frygate was slenderlie manned to auoide suspition, who in the night rowed hard aboord the shoare, with commission to take what ere he were they could first lay hold off, that they might bee the rather aduertised of the state of the Countrey, and where the king was. This deuise sorted to such effect, that through the great diligence of the Lord Cariolus , who was appointed for the same, as one desirous to gaine honour, by dawning of the day they recouered a Rocke, which opened with one of their principall port, vnder which vnseene, they might shelter themselues, and yet haue fight of each shallop, whether hee were fisher or other, that came or went. Long had they not laine expecting their desires. But Fortune, who fauoured their enterprise, discouered vnto them a Galley bound for Babylon , frighted with many passengers of honour, and exceeding rich, with plate, money and Iewels. This Galley first discryed, halfe dismayed the company, who feared shee had bene a man of warre sent of purpose to supprise them, so that each one had greater desire to bee gone againe, then to attempt any thing against them. But in extreames is the Noble minde best tried, as the Lord Cariolus in this, who seeing the cowardise of such base companions, first by faire perswasions encouraged them to the attempt, shewing in his countenance his resolution, and arming them with hope of victorie, not ommitting thereward of so honourable an action, which if they escaped with victorie being the beginning of their enterprise, deserued more to be recompenced then all the rest. To giue you courage my hearts (quoth he,) I say not to you goe, but follow me your Leader, who will either winne her, or leaue my life in so good a cause. But these speeches with those dastards preuailed not at all, who seeing the match vnequall, cryed still to be gone, but Cariolus , who weighed his honour farre aboue all mooued with great impatience at their deniall, with his Rapier drawne came amongst them, reuiling them with odious speeches, and protesting what ere hee were that should in the least sort either by word or countenance, make shew to returne, should with his owne hand be murdered, and so long as he might breath, no faint hearted villaine should dishonour him, who came to gaine honour. Therefore sweet bloods (quoth he,) take courage and feare not, death with honour, is to be valued more then life, with a kingdomes possession, who so followeth me, shall finde me euer his friend, and what ere I possesse, shall haue interest in it. The company how loath soeuer they were to be wonne to so hard an aduenture, yet seeing ye nobleman so resolute thought it bootlesse to refuse him, or to make semblance of dislike holding it more wisedom to keep his honorable friendship by their forward aduenturing, then procure his enuie by cowardise, and seeing it high time to resolue, the Galley approaching them neare, they cryed to proceede, and they would all follow him: Cariolus pleased with their willingnes, had scarce leasure to giue directions for the fight before the Galley came within haling, whose force being such and so well manned as she was, made smal accout of the Frygat: who although they haled many times, yet making as if they heard not, bore vp with them, and valiantly without words entered her in the Prow, putting them from their Ordinance, where they within boord with theyr Pistols, Semiters, and other needfull weapons, valiantly behaued themselues, Cariolus crying still, courage, courage Thessalie , so long that in short time the Caliuers were all showed, and his company leauing the Frygar entred all the Galley, as lawfull Prize to bee shared amongst them. The noble Cariolus hauing ended the fight the kindly with worde of fauour and promise of liberty, with great reward to the slaues, vrged them to applie theyr labour, which with so willing hearts accomplished his request, that in short time they had sight of their flight, and beare with them all they might, which being descryed, they could not imagine whether the Galley were friend or no, wherefore the Generall to auoid perill, as wisedome with valour is requisite, doubting that by firing or other mischiefs, they might annoy them, he called by his flage of Councell, the Commaunders of each ship fryght and Galley, aduising them to take great regard, how they suffered the Galley to boorde them. By that time ye whole Fleet was prepared to squadrons, rowing fiue and fiue, warlike and braue, Cariolus came vp with them, when the Fleet haled them, they espied his owne colours aduanced on the Poope, and an other ensigne hanging vnder her stern which sight gaue them great cause of ioy, to signifie these: gladnes for his successe, each ship in the forward with their Ordinance and small shot, according to the manner of the sea, bad him welcome. In which Tryumph, vnhappily with a scowrer which negligently was shot from a Hargubuze, was the Noble Cariolus wounded, to the great griefe of all the Nobles. The Generall hauing vnderstanding thereof, in his shalop boorded him with all the speed hee might, carrying with him his owne Surgion, and such as professed physicke, doubting the griefe to bee more dangerous then it proued, whereof, albeit the report was first offensiue to him, yet was comforted in this comfort, the wound not mortall, they regarding it as nothing, when the Generall had carefully seene the wound searched and drest, enquiring what they were which he had taken, he caused al the chiefe of them to be called vnto him, who on their examinations would confesse little, which forced the Generall to put one of the inferiours, attendant on Phidamia , the Egyptian kings brother, to be tortured, who forced with the crueltie thereof, confessed what they were, and how their going for Babylon , was to intreate a peace with ye Emperor, who as they were informed, leuieth a power to subuert their countrey, in reuenge of the wrong offered Phedra sister to the Thessalian King, slaine in a battaile fought at sea, by the Egyptian King. This newes was not sooner reuealed then welcome, for hereby they were assured of an expected friend, yet enquired the Generall, whether their King had married the Princesse Phedra , or not and where he liued? Sir quoth the Egyptian, after the victorie obtained, wherein the Noble Theophilus perished, the King my maister, furnished for such an attempt, without further staie or suffering them to gather head, which hee was sure they would doe, hearing of their Kings ill successe: to preuent which, he framed his course thither, where they suddenly arriued, and by their power and pollicie, subdued the chiefest of the Nobilitie, who hauing them sure, they easily and in short time, ouercame the rest, where hee was by generall voyces, (though) against their liking, Crowned King of Thessalie How he punished the Nobility I omit, embracing them, & raising in their places them farre vnworthie such honour and reputation, so that neither Gentleman, or other of account, but liueth in great seruitude and slauerie, glad to bee releeued with needfull viands and apparrell, at their hands which theselues haue often fed. The Princesse for all the perswasion hee can vse, he cannot in loue obtaine, yet hath hee vsed the good Lady, more cruelly then I would willinglie report, the strangenesse of her tortures being such, as few but doth greatlie pittie. And now as our last Poasts imparted vnto vs, he hath appointed a time wherein she must resolutely answere him to his content, or end her life in fire. The which crueltie to her vsed, reported by Merchants of Babylon , with the vertues of the Princesse, & comming to the Emperours eares, being now in the prime of his years, either of policie being mighty, to release her, or whether to make her his Lady and wife, I cannot say, but he hath required her in marriage, pretending great loue vnto her, which the King will not grant vnto, but in words of great despight hath answered him in such manner, as hee greatly misliking, hath with fire and sword defied him, who being a Prince of verie great might and force, our Nobles of Egypt haue thought good, rather to ioyne with fauourable shewes of friendship, then abide the extremitie of his furie. See Sir, quoth he, thus haue I satisfied your request, which is all that I can doe. And for the same quoth the Knight, receiue thy libertie, with what ether fauour I may see thee. These newes were as pleasing to the Maiden knight, as if he had beene possessed of the Crowne, and hauing such aduantage, holding it small policie to loose any time, comforting Cariolus , committing the charge of his Prisoners vnto his good regard, he hasteneth to his owne ship, where vnto Theophilus King of Thessaly he recounted what he had heard, desiring that order might be presently taken, whereby the enemie might bee surprized vnawares, so might they finish their intents with lesse danger and more honour, on which they agreeing, they summoned their chiefest, vnto whom the Kn. recounted what the Egyptian had declared, beseeching the King whose cause it was, to speake his minde, then the rest to giue their aduise what they thought was best to bee done, for accomplishing their desires, and planting the King in his owne Countries. These questions propounded, each particular peril with each aduantage, and occasion which offered good successe was thronghly debated, when they had each one deliuered theyr mind, Pheander , whose honour was now in the Ballance, as one that desired no worldly possessions so much as the reputation with his Mistresse and the king said, Noble gentlemen you haue all like resolute, braue, and hardy men at arms shewed in your speeches the desire you haue to do this Noble King that seruice for which wee come, if therefore you will encline me your eares to my opinion among the rest, I shall acknowledge my selfe greatly fauoured by you. The whole company which by curtesie was drawne to his loue, was easilie wonne to this request, and willed him say on, which he did in this manner. My Noble Lords, and friends in Armes, touching these motions made for our proceedings, it hath been by the Egyptian reported, whome we doe credite, the King is in possession of Thessaly , which Crowne, we know all, he doth dishonorably vsurpe. The Princesse, she in such extreame, that by his cruell censure is not long to liue, vnlesse against her will she grant to loue him, who is loathsome in her eyes. To prevent which, it behoueth vs to search the best mean that wee can, & for that euerie one hath his censure, this is my aduise, that hauing these Nobles in our possession, in whome consisteth the strength of his Realme, our Company beeing lustie and strong, we will raunge their Confines, where finding place and opportunitie, we may surprize them at vnawares, who being subdued, his force shall be the more impaires. That done, we with all conuenient speed passe for Thessaly , where I doubt not but to come before the time limited the princesse for her answer, & to rescue her, deliuering the possession of the Crowne, into the Kinges hand, the knight hauing said, presently it was confirmed, and ech captaine departed to his charge according to the directions giuen entering the confines of Egypt , where they wrought by such policie and directions of the Mayden Knight , that they landed in the dead of the night the greatest part of their Armies marching in warlike order towards the City of Buckelia , where the King kept his chiefe Court, and where their greatest force was. But before they could recouer the walles, or come to view the same for any aduantage, they were discryed, and the gates shut, against whom the Cittizens made such power as they could for their defence, which vnexpected of the knight, caused him to stay vntill himselfe went to know their pleasures, and to deliuer his owne intent. And mounting himselfe onely accompanied with his Herald and one Trumpet, he came before the Walles, summoning the to parley, which was answered againe by another trumpet, and such of the Nobilitie as was within, shewed themselues vnto him, demaunding a cause of his comming in Armes, to disturbe their Dominions, and the Subiects to their King. Nobles of Egypt , answered the Mayden knight, Theophilus lawfull King of Thessalie , whose Crown, your king Donacia vniustly withholdeth, preserued by heauens power for your scourge, & to reuenge the blood of those Innocents, slaine by your cruelty, is come with fire & sword to require his right, which if you accept, and will deliuer, hee sends you by me mercy, if you denie and doe not surrender your crown of Egypt , with all the regalties, honours, priuiledges and customes thereunto belonging, and become his faithful subiects and Liegemen, you shall all perish with the sword, and your Countrey flaming with fire, shall be ouerthrowne, in such maner, that in time to come, there shall be nothing foud but the ruines of your gorgious Palaces, and stately cities, this hath he vowed by the honour of his name: therefore choose like wary Champions, and let me know your willes, for no detraction may be vsed. The Egyptian Pheeres, which heard the name of Theophilus , whom they long sithence supposed dead, were surprised with a sudden feare, in such maner as their sences were depriued, & they rested like men in extasie, fearing the reuenge of him, whome they did all know was by their King highlie wronged, yet shewing the Nobility of their minds, shaking off feare, they sayd: Sir knight, thy vnlooked for message is such, as we know not suddenly how to answere, neyther will we like faint hearted Peasants, derogate from our noble Auncesters, the Honour they long maintained with cowardize to deliuer that, which nature and fidelity vrgeth vs to defend, our liues we esteeme as they are, vain and euery day subiect to casualties and death, nor doe we enioy ye smal time giuen vs, but onely for our Common-weale, and benefite of our Countrey, being pillars, on whom the State dependeth: you haue dastardlike wayted oportunity to take vs at aduantage, our king not present, whose right and interest me are sworne to maintaine. Therefore to Theophilus say: That as we serue our King, and liue by his grace, wee will with our dearest bloud withstand the inuasion of any forraine Prince whatsoeuer. If our King as you alledge haue offered wrong vnto him, let him reuenge him on him, & seeke his amends where he may get it, for other entertainement let him not looke for here. The Mayden Knight hearing their resolution, greatlie commended their valour and loyalty to their Soueraigne, who seeing their truth pittied them, and wished all men to faithfull mindes: yet how well soeuer he liked their answer their intents was to be considered, who came with more resolute minds then to be wonne with faire words, and therefore returned with all haste to the Campe, where to the king he briefly deliuered the summe of their answere, which the king tooke no pleasure to heare, rather desiring their submission by curtesie, then the effusion of blood, yet not to pittie them in such manner, to giue ouer the aduantage hee had: wherfore that they might be assured of his resolution which came to conquere, from his vsurping Foe, taking his Army which was ledde by the appointed General, he brought them before the Citie, vnto whom they gaue many sharpe & fierce Allarums, and were valiantly repulsed, not without greate losse of either part. Thus continued the Assault long and dreadfull, till Pheander noting the time of the Princesse Phedraes death to draw neare, when either she must bee rescued or die that extreame death assigned, hee determined to put all vpon fortune, to see the end, & not longer to prolong ye time And calling those whose valour he had most assurance off, hee made knowne to them his intent, requiring their company, whereunto small perswasions serued, desirous to be partners with him in his actions, which were in all things very honorable. The Knight assured of his friendes & followers in this action, gaue directions to all Captaines at the going downe of the Sun, to be readie furnished with their companies to bid the enemie battell, doing their best before ye place where their chiefe force was, in ye mean time he with his accoplices wold assail som other part which was of lesse ability to defed Thus these noble Gentlemen, hauing determined to win the horse or lose the saddle, neglected no time, that against ye appointed time, each man in his place was readily furnished and most valiantly attempted with all warlike Ensignes to enter the Citie, battering, scaling, and each seuerall wayes searching, that policie or valor would permit, to bring the City to ruine, and vanquish the enemie, which was most nobly defended with great courage, and much losse on either part, While they were at their fierce and hardy fight on either part it is not to be forgotten, how the Mayden Knight with his associates, seeking oportunitie, by chance lighted on the side of an olde wall, which being somewhat decayed, they by industrie of their hands and painefull toyle, easilie made the breach such, that they entred at pleasure, & passing through ye streetes which led to the assaulted gate, molested no man vntill they came thither, where entering the same, slew ye watch and opened the gate, aduancing the Thracian Kings colours on the top thereof, crying euer in their Way as they passed, Thessalie, Thessalie . This crie amazed the Citizens, and armed the Thracians , to the hotter attempt, who entred to the rest, & with such courage bare them, that they had soone vanquished the defendats, who to saue their liues, had betaken theselues to their Churches, as places of Sanctuarie, from whence they sent their wiues and Infants all disrobed, to search the king, & in their names to require his pardon, such diligence made the modest Matrones, that they were brought by Pheander to the king, where prostrating themselues at his feet, their faces be drawed with teares, they most humbly besought him to take compassion on them, their husbands, and children, that as he was a Conqueror, so with fauour to vse the glorie of his victorie, as the poore subiects might not haue cause to complaine to the of his crueltie, who had done nothing blame worthie, but as true subiects to their Soueraigne the King whose heart was moued with pittie at their sute, gently tooke them vp, measuring their calamitie by his owne misfortunes, and bethought him of their fidelitie, yet pretending a show of vnkindnes, for refusing his mercie proffered them by his noble Generall, he would not be intreated suddainly to graunt them life, which the Noble Pheander noted, and like himselfe, waying their faith to their Prince & weale of their Countrey, which with their liues they had sought to maintaine, hee was content to remit their fault, & not only to pardon their liues, but restore the to al former liberties, & places of honor, without any disparagemet to their royaltie, so that they would acknowledge him their Soueraigne, and be as faithfull to him and his, as they had shewed themselues to that vsurper his enemie. This choyse at first seemed hard, yet of two euills the least is to be chosen, as these Nobles of Egypt , who seeing their liues, Wiues, Children, and what they possest, to be in the hands of strangers, whom they could not withstand, making a vertue of necessitie, were the rather wonne to yeelde themselues vnto the kings pleasure, at the intercession of their Wiues whose teares shed in abundance moued them to ruth, in such wise, that subiecting on these conditions to his Excellence, they proclaimed him king of Thessaly and Egipt , swearing sealty vnto him, & deliuering Hostages for theyr loyalty. This done, the King with generall consent crowned, the Commons gan conceiue an especiall hope of his honourable loue to them, whose kindnes was such, that hauing the Citie, and whole kingdome at his pleasure, would not suffer his Souldiers to imbeasell or purloyn in any sort, but rather make choice to reward the Mercenary men out of his owne Treasurie, which honourable beginning gained their especiall liking: when order was taken for the gouernment of the State: Pheander , who was mindfull of the Princesse Phedra , hasted the King on for Thessaly , often putting him in mind, what daungers the good Lady was likely to abide, if she consented not to the king, who was more cruell then curteous, wherefore taking their pledges, he left the noble Cariolus his Uizegerent, to take the gouernement vppon him in his absence, and with the next fauourable wind they set sayle for Thessaly , where to their good successe wee leaue them, to tell you of Mustapha the heathen prince, who was in the Princes Nutania her custodie. How the Emperour of Constantinople was most grieuously offended with his son for his ill successe, & by perswasions of his nobles sendeth his ransome, and other greate gifts to the Princesse Nutania, with the king of Thessaly, and the powers of Thrace, arriuing in Thessaly; The freeing of the Princes from the vsurper, and happy obtaining of his kingdome. The mighty Emperor of Constantinople vnderstanding the ill successe of his sonne, with the great slaughter of his men, was mooued at the first to such chollor, that he had determined for euer to abandon his sonne, and neuer to haue knowne or regarded him, but being perswaded by his Nobilitie, which tenderly loued the Prince, he was at length by their motions wonne to conceiue, how vnstable fortunes chaunces are, and how victories sometimes happen as well to the Coward, as the valiant: not forgetting to vrge vnto him, how dishonourable it were for a prince to leaue ye meanest subiect he had at such an exigent, that should aduenture his life in his seruice, much more was his Maiestie bound by natures laws to relieue his Son, and not suffer him as one forsaken to remain in the hands of his enemies, vpo which motion of his Bashawes, the King caused two Gallyes to be rigged and furnished, appointing of his chiefest Nobles too, for that voyage to Thrace , as well to aduertise him of his Sons welfare, which he fauoured, as also to agree vpon the summe of his Raunsome: All thinges furnished for the voyage, the Bashaws hauing taken leaue of the Emperor, and the rest of their friends, fauoured with a happy gale, they shortly arriued in Thrace , of whose arriuall, the King by his Messengers was aduertised, who being of Nature most honourable, and curteous in behauiour, caused a sumptuous trayne of Courtiers, with all the honourable manner they could, to receiue them at their Port of landing, taking like order in all lodgings and places of repast, his Officers at his charge to attend them, which in such exquisite manner was performed, as the Bashaws with their retinue admired their intertainment. Thus by easie iourneyes they came to the Court, where the King with the Princesse gaue them many welcoms, inquiring kindly after the good health of the renowned Emperour their Master, whom hee maligned no whit at all, how hardly soeuer he had measured his friendship with him: when the King & these Nobles had spent some time in discoursing, they enquired of the health of their Prince Mustapha , whom the King caused to be sought, & brought to their presence, before whom they bowed themselues in all humblenes, as to the son of their Soueraigne, whom he again with all kindenes imbraced passing the time with much pleasure, ioying in the welfare of his friends. The King doing them all the honour that could bee deuised, passing the time wt such recreatio & gentle sports, as the country affoorded, at length a summe of mony for the Princes raunsom was agreed vpon to their content, for that it was reasonable, & the conditions honorable, which obtained their victuals by the king was obtained: and all necessaries at his charges puruayed, in such manner, and with so much bounty, as they had great cause to reporte honorablie of the King. Long had they not tarried, but a gale of Wind pleasant and fauourable, presents it selfe, which good time they neglected not, but taking leaue of the King, their Prince, and Princesse Nutania , who accompanied them onwards to their galleyes, three whole dayes iourneyes, they leaue them to ye care of their iourney: who being imbarqued, in short time arriued at Constantinople , where, how welcome they were to the Emperor and his Nobles, I omit, to let you vnderstand of ye honorable reports made of their intertainment in Thrace , & the welfare of the Prince, whose company there were fewe but desired. The strangenesse of this report made of Philarcus , was exceeding admirable in the Emperours eares, who wondred not a little, that a King whom he had so much wroged, should vse such kindnesse to his Son, and curtesie to his messengers, extolling highly the honorable condition of the King, and much lamenting his owne follies, so rashly without any occasion offered, to iniurie him so farre, as to spoyle his Countrey, and to rob him perforce of his only Child, his sole delight and comfort. To recompence all which, & to keepe his friendship, he presently elected other Nobles for Thrace , to be imployed which with the Princes ransome, and manie rich Presents to the King and his daughter were dispatched, with Letters of loue, and desire of amity, all which comming to the Thracian King, were so heartily accepted as they could wish, and in presence of the Nobles & states of both Realms was the peace concluded, and a band of euerlasting friendeship promised, to all their ioyes. Thus with great delight at the earnest intercession of the King, spent those Turkish Nobles some time in Thrace , till their prefered time gan to draw to end, when receiuing theyr prince with great rewards & many thankes for their pains, they put to Sea & were not long before they recouered theyr famous City of Constatinople , where they were mostroially welcomed, but especially the Prince, for whose safety many pastimes was ordained, with Iustings, Turneyes, Barriers and other pleasing delights, wherein the Prince honourablie bare himselfe, to the great ioy of his Father & pleasure of the whole-state, who gloried greatly in him, which was likely to prooue a most honourable Prince, and their ensuing comfort. But while I digresse, let it be considered, that ye Mayden Kn : who thirsted to see the ende of his desires, slept no time, but made all possible meanes he could, as winde & weather would giue leaue, vntil he arriued in Thessalie , which he recouered in so good time as hee could wish, and taking that opportunitie which was offered, he landed his companies, and neare to the Sea side Encamped his power, vntill he might be aduertised of what power the King was, and where he remained, for the attaining of which, many espialls were sent out sudry waies, and many Ambuscados layde to intercept such as trauelled the Countrey: but their Landing being discryed, euery one in all the haste they could make hyde, them to their Cities & places of defence, where they, with their store of prouisio which they brought, were receiued. The King, who securely passed his time, taking care for nothing, and ioying whollie in the hopes he conceiued of his Ladies graunt, being aduertised of the arriuall of a forraine power, ouercome with sorrow at ye instant, as one yt neuer tasted aduersitie, was surprized with such suddaine heauines, as no wordes, no perswasions, nor any cofort, might mittigate his sorrow, what paines soeuer his Nobles tooke to pacifie him, his guiltie conscience presaging some hard fortune to be at hand: the nobility which had more regard to his welfare, and his Country then he could on the suddaine imagine, after they had caused their Rampiers to be shut, & their Fortresses to be made (doubting the worst) desirous to be resolued what ye enemy was, that thus daringlie durst boord him in his owne countrey, they caused the Lord Mama Bacha , somtime of the chiefest in Thessalie a wise & wel gouerned Gentleman, to be sent vnto them, to know whence they were, and their pretence, which against their wils, vnacquainting the with their pretence, had entered their confines. The Noble man to whose charge this was committed, though hee had small care of any matter, liuing dishonoured in his owne Countrey, where, in his Kings raigne he was the onely honoured, & amongst his Nobles in most account of him, had his wits sundrie waies imployed, and on diuerse matters, yet amongst all imaginations, the thought of his owne soueraigne was least, the report of his death being so certaine, but whatsoeuer he could imagine was vncertaine, wherefore as desirous to be resolued of his doubts, as the King and Nobles to be thereof certified, onely accompanied with an other of the disgraced Nobilitie, they hied them towards the Campe, and was by the Ambuscadoes soone surprized and brought to the Pauilion of the Generall, who saluting them with kind countenance, demanded whence they were, and what occasions led them in such suspitious maner towards their Campe. The Nobles which had small care which end went forward, after they had well aduised themselues, said, (sir,) if we giue not those titles your honour deserue, pardon vs which offend not of presumption therein, but of ignorance: that we come as spyalls to view thy force, and to discouer them, therein you deceiue your selfe, but come as messengers from our King, to know thy pretence, and what thou meanest landing thy Armies without his lycence, which is contrarie to law of Armes? If thou come in peace and not as an enemie, resolue vs this, and thou honourest vs? The Prince taking their words at aduantage, where they said they came from their king, with a counterfeit shew of great dislike, said: Traytors how dare you to my face vse those colours of simplicitie, when you auerre you come from your king, which I know is altogether vntrue? Therefore that you shall warne the rest how they delude me, you shall haue the reward of traytors, and calling for the prouost Marshall, commanded him to cut of their heads. The Nobles, thinking he had bene past iest, seeing their executions so ready, humbly besought him to credit what they had said, which was true, and pardon their liues, for that law of Armes protecteth the messenger of the Prince, from whom they come, therefore it would redound to his great dishonour, to violate the hostility of all Princes. While they were thus at their shrift, it chanced Theophilus their lawfull King, to enter the pauilion of his Generall, whose presence much apalled the Thessalian Nobles, who standing as men past themselues had no thought but in beholding him, which so much resembled their supposed dead King, the long noting of whome caused them to renue theyr sorrows, and with remebrance of the times they had past, to shead teares. The King imagining what they thought, knowing them well, put the from their studious thoughts, thus. Men of Thessalie , what meaneth your heauines, thinke you hereby to delude this Noble Gentleman, or by your fainings to procure your fauour, if eyther one or other of these causes you deceiue your selues, and incurre you more trouble? Wherfore to auoyde the perils incident vnto you, if you bee right Thessalians , and tender the welfare of your Princes in whose rescue wee come, briefly declare vnto vs, in what estate shee abideth, & where the vsurping King hath his residence. Mana Bacha hearing that pleasing tongue, wherewith hee was acquainted, assured himself that it was their king, & without further stay, humbly kissing his Maiesties feet, his face bedewed with teares, & his tongue foltring in his mouth, as one with suddaine ioy ouercome, hee sayth. My gracious Soueraigne, how glad am I that enioy breath to behold your Maiesty aliue, whom all the World reputeth for dead, the heauy tidings of which, with your ill successe, mooued the harts of your louing Subiects to such extreame heauines, as nothing might comfort, that past comfort, and all hope of beholding your Princely face, wee reckoned you amongst the dead. In the extream of this sorrow, as al euils commonly fall in one, when euery hart and eye was deploring the losse of so gracious a Prince, then beganne our further griefes, through the oppressions of this vsurping Errant, whose cruelty vnto thy subiects hath beene such as grieueth me to recount. Thy Sister he detaineth in prison, from whence he hath vowed shee shall neuer bee freede, vntill with consent she take him for her King, or by gaine saying his demaunds, receiue that death which he hath doomed her vnto, whose wrongs wee poore men, how much so euer wee pitty, yet can we remedie nothing, our ability being little, and our reputation lesse, amongst these cruell Egyptians, who hath robbed vs of what we possest, not suffering vs to enioy our ancient patrimonie, nor what they might anie way dispoyle vs of: to reuenge of which, we hope in thee and thy power, who wilt maintaine and defend thy owne lawfull right, rather offering thy selfe amongst vs that honour and loue thee as our liues, then leaue vs any more. To the accomplishing of which, my selfe, with all thy owne Countrey borne Subiects that we can procure vnto vs, will lende what aide our weake force will stretch vnto, and thereof assure your Maiesty. The King hearing the lamentable report of the Lord Mama Bacha , could not forbeare to shew the heauinesse of his hearts sorrow by his outward motions, yet to hide it as hee might, imbracing them both, hee framed a feined ioy to see them, how soeuer his heart was ouerburthened with griefe. When they had passed sometime in parley about their affayres, and that some offers were made by these Nobles, of their ayde and assistance, a generall Councell was called, where, by consent of such as had gouernment: vnderstanding the power of Donatio the Usurper, was no more but such as guarded his holdes, it was determined, after the Armie had refreshed themselues two or three daies, to march forward to the Cities, there to beleager the King, and to cut off from the all supply of prouision for victuals, where they had small store. In the meane time, the Lords of Thessaly , to giue notice to all their friends (with all speed) as they tendred theyr owne liberties, to repayre with such power as they could make vnto the Campe. This deuise was no sooner determined on, but the Noble Mama Bacha , without returning to the king, spared not his pains, and all others which hee could commaund or entreate, proclaming in euery place as they passed Theophilus their lawfull King straightly charging all naturall subiects of Thessaly to make repayre vnto the Campe. These tidings at first were hardly beleeued, yet such was the rumour of a forraine power landed, that al which could bear Armes repayred to the King, whom they found at the assault of the Citie, where the Usurper kept, such was the multitudes of people, which from all Countries in his Regions came vnto him, that in short time hee had power sufficient to ouerrunne a Kingdome. The vsurper Donatio , who had least thought euer to heare or see the Thessalian King: when the report of his beeing in the Campe, was brought vnto him, his courage quailed, and his hope of enioying the Crowne, was quite extinguished: so that despayring, hee came like a man lunatike: that nothing (whatsoeuer) might mooue him to any mirth or content, so that giuing ouer all, hee cared not what became of himselfe or his: yet was hee carefullie counselled by his Nobles, who regarded both his honour and their owne safety: but whatsoeuer they might counsell, or determine, was ill imployed, at his hands was nothing to be had, Wherfore after they saw his smal care, and that hee was not to be aduised, they determined, eyther in fielde with vnappointed battell to trie their fortunes: or by some such composition as might be for their countries safety and their reputation, to giue ouer their title pretended to the Crowne of Thessaly . Before that any thing was of them resolued the Mayden knight which had his minde on his Lady, as well as of other affayrs, could not rest in content, vntil hee had finished, and eyther gained what they came for, or seene the euent of fortune. Wherefore to auoyde further delayes: hee summoned the City to parley, wherein he required their answere, Whether they would receiue their lawfull king or no, if yea, they should suffer him in peace to enter, or otherwise vpon their answere, to abide the hazard incident to Armes which he protested should be voyde of all fauour, if they preuayled, and they refused this offer of his. These summons caused the nobility to looke vvith better aduise into their states, & vvith consideratio to way each particular perill, which they found to be very many, and dangerous, especially seeing the multitude, who were naturall subiects, and did rather affect their owne King, howsoeuer they professed in outward appearance, then the Usurper, which made them the more earnest with their King, vnto whome they declared the offers made by the Mayden Knight , with the doubts they had of his successe, who were nothing in number to the Kings power, which dayly increased, and cotrary his decreased: wherefore they aduised him to yeelde vnto such articles of honor as they would require, which should be both for his honour, and safety of him and his. The vsurper hearing those perswasions from them, wheron his chiefest hope consisted, forgetting all former friendship and loue to any of them, with most odious words reuiled them calling them traytors, dastards, and vpbraiding them with cowardise, which were neuer found but euer forward in all his actions, onely this excepted, wherein was no hope. These speeches mooued his Nobles to such fury: that departing from him in discontent, they resolued for their own safty to seeke what means they could, and not by delaies to incurre his displeasure: whose friendship they were by al means they could vse, to intreate. Wherfore in name of all the rest, the Lord Philiago principall Treasurer vnto the King, by whose direction the rest would bee gouerned, sent for the princesse ( Phedra ) from prison, whom hee vsed with Honourable speeches, comforting hir with hope of her Kingly Brother, who liued, and was in person come with a strong power to deliuer her from that captiuity which so long she endured, humbly beseeching hir Grace to become a fauourable soliciter to his Highnesse for them, who were to be commaunded by their Soueraigne, whose Subiects they were, protesting yt neyther for enuy to him or his, they vndertooke the action, but at commaundement, and to auoid the ignominious title of cowardise, which all of honourable birth or minde, ought to detest. The good Princesse which could not tell, whether she might giue credit to his wordes or no, aunswered him thus. My Lord Philiago , vnder the greenest grasse lurketh the most perilous poyson, and experience taught me, in my durance, the knowledge of friends, these suddaine offers of loue to my brother, whome you all know, is long sithence dead, causeth me the more to dread, I am going to him, and that your offered friendship is but to that end, to bereaue me of that which once I wished to leaue, if it bee so, good my Lord, hide not the trueth thereof from mee, for therein shall you shewe your charitable minde to a distressed Captiue. Farre bee it from my thought, Noble Lady, quoth Philiago , that I should any way delude you, or mooue you to credit any thing other the truth, whom I haue my greatest hope of good, to assure you of which, so pleaseth your Excellence, I will my selfe bring you to his Maiesties presence. When the Princesse heard him make these proffers of fauours, and perceyued by his iesture hee did not counterfeit, ouercome with ioy, shee was in a traunce, from which, reuiued by the carefull industry of the Lady Vrania , wife to the Lord Philiago , shee gaue the Noble man great thanks for his tidinges, assuring him on her Word, that shee would so recompence that good, as hee nor his, should haue any cause to complain of her vngratefulnesse. Urging him with her curteous speech, to detract no time, but to bring her to the Campe, where the King was, which hee willingly yeelded vnto, and causing a stately Chariot to bee ordayned, and richly apparrelling the Princesse as befitteth her, accompanied with his Lady and two Daughters of rare beauty, himselfe wayting on her disrobed, issued out of the Gates, and in short time came neare the Campe, and were by the Sentronels discouered, and brought to the Kinges Presence, who seeing the Princesse, whome hee had great doubt the Tyrant would haue murthered, so sodaine a ioy surprized him, as he might not speake, yet ouercomming his passion, ioyning his face with hers, after many kinde imbracings, hee sayth: Phedra , how haue the Heauens blessed me, in giuing me life to behold thee, more deare vnto mee then a million of liues, whome sithence I possesse, as the onely ioy I conceiud hope of in this world, I account my happinesse more, then to bee possessed of the worlds reuenue. But tell me Phedra , what are these that accompany thee, strangers they are to mee, how friendly soeuer they haue vsed thee. Most gracious Soueraigne, for these noble persons, I am to entreate, hauing passed my word, to be their safe conduct from any violence should be offered them, therefore good my Lord receyue into your fauour the Lord Philiago Treasurer to the Usurper, his Lady & daughters, such as are by them protected, so shalt thou honor me more, by maintaining my word, which relying on your princely nature, I haue past. The Maiden knight willing to hold her honour in regarde, sayd, Madam, how his Maiesty on the suddaine may bee wonne to fauour your sute, I cannot say, hauing had such great cause to reuenge him on their cruelty, but for his life, let him thanke your Grace, if he enioy it. The King, whose hart pitty mooued to tender the sute of the Princesse, comming towards the noble Philiago and his Lady, with great curtesie tooke them from the earth whereon they kneeled, accepting them to his Maiestie, vsing them with such honour and curtesie, that they admired him. After hee had reuiued with his kinde confections these sorrowfull suters, he sayd, Philiago , as I haue pardoned thy life, so fayle not to tell me thy Kings determination, whether he will yeeld, or in battell trye the euent of our fortunes? How the Lorde Philiago describeth vnto the King the whole estate and determination of the vsurper, who flying from the forces of this puissant army, is by the Mayden Knight pursued and taken, whom he sendeth to the Princes Nutania for a present. Gratious Soueraigne, quoth Philiago , that hee determines to seeke your Grace, is more then I can say, for such desperate humours assayleth him, that hee is not himselfe and friendes fayleth him, from the noble to the peasant, whose wisedomes haue with graue aduise considered, what wrongs haue beene offered your Grace, and hath vpon your Princely motions of mercy solicited him to pitty them, and yeeld vnto your grace, which when hee could not bee perswaded vnto, we all left him, and I in name of all the Nobilitie, humbly beseech your Highnesse of mercy, who onely attend but my returne, at which time on your gracious word they will deliuer the City. My Lord quoth the King, what cause soeuer I haue in ye most extreamest maner to reuenge me on you all, yea, to the very child that sucketh, that I omit. And that thou and they all shall know I delight not in bloud, nor wish I the life of my mortallest foe, return vnto them, and from me say, that if in submissiue wise, they issue their gates, & at my foote craue mercie, bring with them their vsurping King, I will accept them, so that thou and they shall sweare your dutifull allegeance to me and mine, shall be hereafter maintained in such manner, as becommeth faithfull subiects to their Prince, I will admitte them to my Grace, and will be vnto them a louing and gracious Soueraigne. Philiago , which had that he most desired, vttering with many deepe sighes the ioye his heart conceiued for his good successe, after many humble and heartie praiers for the Kings long life in all happines to bee maintained, hee besought his grace to giue him leaue with his happy tidings, to make glad the hearts of those sorrowfull Nobles, which expected his returne, which the King graunted, detayning his wife and daughters to attend his sister, whose ioyes exceeded the extreames of her misery, enioying her Noble brother, which shee was out of all hope euer to behold again. To their recreation wee leaue them, and passe on with the Lord Philiago , who made no stay vntil he came to the gates, where diuers of his friends expected his comming. No sooner entered he the Citie, but summoning the Nobles and Gouernours all together, he deliuered vnto them, what fauour he had receyued of the King, and how willing hee was to shewe like clemancy vnto them all, vpon these coditions specified, whereunto he perswaded them to yeeld, not omitting any thing to make them mindfull of the little hope they had of the vsurpers successe, for which they had no reason to encline vnto him, who had so small regard of them, but rather let him endure the reward of his owne follies, then that so many should perish for one mans wrongs. Resolued thus, they hastened vnto the Court, at whose suddaine entering, the King was greatly appalled, considering in what discontent they parted with him, yet shewing a countenance voyd of all feare, he required, the cause of their comming whome they soone resolued, letting him know each particuler of their intent, perswading him to patience, for what they had determined should be accomplished. The King hearing his owne doome of miserie pronounced, albeit it moued him to great impatience, yet restraining chollor, with his smooth speech, hee besought them of respite for his answere till the next morning, which they willingly cosented vnto. And so leauing him, they departed each one to his seuerall mantion. But he in whose heart reuenge harboured, hauing his minde wholly bent on their ruine, after he had conferred with such as were as full of mischiefe, as himselfe of crueltie, and was by them aduertised, what power they were off, hee caused them secretly in the night Armed, to assemble at the Court, where in very couert manner they remained, vntill the time came that the Nobles should come to receiue their answere, who voyd of all suspect of euill, entered the Pallace, desirous to know his pleasure, touching the matter then betweene them in question. No sooner came they to the Kings presence, but the cruell tirant shewing in his countenance the pretence of his heart, began in tearmes of great reproach to exclaime against the Nobles, whome hee accused of treason and vniust dealing, against him and the state of his countrey, that flying from him which was their lawfull soueraigne, sought to supplant him, to Crowne another. But Traytors quoth he, you shall reape such reward as your treacherie deserueth, and there withall giuing the watch word, his confederates which for the purpose was ambushed, issued vpon them, and suddainely surprised as many as they could come by, the rest that fled, entring the City, proclaimed the lawfull King, offering in his name free pardon of life and goods, to as many as followed them. At which offer of grace, the Commons wearied with the oppression of the Usurper, in multitudes assembled themselues, & guided by Philiago , they fiercely assayled the King in his Court, sleying as many as they could reach vnto, and rescue their fellow Nobles, whose deaths by the Tyrant was determined, had not the valour & policie of this noble Philiago preuailed. In this exploit, many of the company of the Usurper were slaine, himself wt such as escaped, betooke them to the mountaines, where they encamped themselues, expecting aide of those he had preferred. But they more regarding their owne weale, then his honor, and seeing no comfort or hope of recouery, submitted themselues vnto the Kings mercy, and were of him receyued. This Cannesado passed, the commons with generall voyce elected Theophilus for their King, Philiago , poasted him with all speede to the campe, and to the King deliuered the trecherous pretence of the Usurper, with the euet of all his and their actions, & in the name of the whole State besought him to receiue the Crowne, and the faithful loue of all the Commons. Theophilus hearing the mischieuous pretence of this vsurper, pittying his subiects that had so long been gouerned by a Prince so ill conditioned, at the earnest intercession of the noble Philiago , guarded with a Troup of his trustiest men at Armes, marched to the Citie, at the Entery of which, the whole Nobility, bare legged and bare footed, receyued him, and to his Highnes deliuered the keyes of their Ports, with presents of rich prize, marching before him to the palace, crying wt a generall voyce Theophilus, Theophilus . The King noting his Subiects loues, with heartie thankes requited them all, exhorting them to obedience and loyaltie, which if they faithfully followed, he would be a mercifull Prince vnto them. Theophilus , in possessing of his Crown, willing his friends should participate with him, dispatched a Messenger for the Mayden Knight , the Princes and her attendants, who al as their duty, obediently fulfilled his comandement, the Maiden Knight excepted, who carefull of his charge, and looking into the practises and deuises of the Usurper, besought his Grace to pardon his not comming to the Court for a time, vntill he had seene the euent of his affayres, and sending for such guides as he was enformed to bee well acquainted in those Desarts, hee put himselfe in search for the Usurper, and his scattered crewe, whome in short time he found, to the number of one thousand, on horse and foote, which he no sooner espyed, but chearing his companies, which were not aboue forty, not minding to giue them dayes, he brauely assayled them, and so valiantly behaued himselfe in that Conflict, that after two whole houres spent in hardie seates of Chiualrie, there was few of the companies liuing. The King he surprized, as hee was flying, with whom he returned to the City, and to the King Theophilus deliuered him, who kindly accepting his Present, returning the Knight many thanks for his paines. This brunt past, & al things by the valor and good industry of the Mayden Knight brought to quiet end, the king vnwilling to detaine his Subiects from their owne homes, recompencing euery man for his good seruice, dislodged the Campe. A world of wonder it were to recount what generall ioye was throughout the Land for the returne of their king, and his good successe, for which great triumphes were ordayned, with Iusts, Barriers and Tilte, wherein the Nobles of the Country in great brauery behaued themselues, but the best & chiefest honour in each seuerall action was giuen the Mayden knight, who like himselfe, so behaued himselfe, as there was no talke throughout the Court and country, but tended to the generall commendations of this noble Prince. Thus all things hath ende, so ended these Triumphes, and the King in peace enioyed his kingdome, which through the Thracian kinges assistance, and the valor of this honored knight he obtained. Al things quieted, ye Maide knight after he had a small time reposed himselfe from his trauels, humbly besought his Highnes, to suffer him with his Companies to depart, which fauour he could not by any intreaty obtaine. Wherefore to satisfie the king with his owne longer stay he dismissed his Armie, whome the king so royally rewarded, as no man had cause to complaine of his time spent, but euery one to speake of his honour and bounty. The coduet of whom after hee had with great care puruayde them victuals, with all thinges necessary, he committed to Vrelia , a noble man of Thrace , by whom the knight aduertised the king of his stay: which was chiefly for the Lord Cariolus , whom they left Vizeroy in Egypt , recommending also his seruice vnto the Lady Nutania , hee presented by this Noble Vrelia , the Vsurper vnto her, as her Prisoner, (and his Conquest.) Thus all things carefully puruayde, the winde blowing a fauourable gale: they imbarked themselues, and sayling with a winde as they could wish, they shortly arriued in safety at their desired Port, where their welcom was such of the king, as they might ioy to receiue it, where friend with friende ioye for their returne: onely the Princesse endured the greatest pennance, wishing the return of her knight, who could not be perswaded of his welfare, wanting his presence yet accepted she the Vsurper his prisoner: and through the great protestations of the Lord Vrelia : had hope to see him againe: whose heart enioyed small content wanting his company. How olde Barnardine sometime Tutor to the Prince Dionicius, now the Mayden knight had answere from the Oracle at Delphos, how the Prince liued, and what ioy he conceiued therof, and stil continued his serch of him Here Gentiles we leaue the noble Pheander in company of the Thessalian king, spending his time in small content wanting the sight of his desired Lady: and his Lady with tears bewailing him, whom she more desired the ye world possessions: to shew what hapned ancient Bernardine , who as you haue heard before, left the Court with all his possession, Pilgrime-like iourneying towards Delphos there of the Oracle to be aduertised of his King, & the Princes life or death: and comming to the sacred Chappell of Apollo , after his Orizons done, and his offerings made before the shrine of Apollo , the pittifull god moued at his intercession, and considering the faithfull loue to his Prince & countrey, which is pleasing both to gods and men, after hee had with teares bewayling his Prince, was thus answered. Barnardine thy faithfull loue to Prince and Country, we haue regarded, and mooued with pitty of thee and thy Common-wealth, whose subiects distressed, desire to haue knowledge of their King and his princely sonne, with what shall befall them, receiue these lines: which shall import the euent of all, yet for a time conceale them, & continue thy trauell. Barnardine whose heart was lightned with this comfortable voyce, looking about him, espied a Paper: which taking vp, he read in this manner. Ambitious shall your land with wars annoy, Taking by force what Subiect doth enioy. A forraine power these Rebels pride shall quell, Through whom your Commons shall in quiet dwell. Before his face, whom they suppose for dead, The Traytors shall for life with pitty plead. A Stranger Queene, on Kingly seat shall sit, Vnto whose rule, your Commons shall submit. Religious, seeing your Countries happie state, Ouercome with ioy, shall die at Princes gate, Hee vnto whom your Crowne belongs aright, Is all in one, a Merchant, King, and Knight, Supposed lost, thou once againe shall meete, In forraine soyle, sitting on Princely seate, When in thy trauell, such one thou shalt see, As such there is, which shall be found by thee, Returne thou then, else dread thy guiltlesse blood, Whose life preserued is, for thy Countries good. When the aged Pilgrime had perused these Lines, musing at the darknes of the same, which he construed many wayes, yet had no certaintie, wherefore resoluing on the mercifull fauour of the God, which had so pittifullie heard his prayer, he passed on his iourney, in search for those Princes, which he hoped were liuing, whom to his trauell we leaue, to returne vnto the Princesse Phedra , who hauing the company of the Mayden Knight , had sundry motions of desire to enioy his Loue, euermore applauding his person, curtesie, and valour, which so farre exceeded all mens in her iudgement, that shee honored him for the onely Paragon of the world, holding her for the most happiest Ladie on the earth, which should enioy his loue, wishing that she were worthie of his loue, and framing her selfe by all meanes that modestie would permit, to gaine it. But hee whose heart was fixed on his Ladie, had no motion of any other, onely wished to be with her whome he so much honoured, whose presence, he more desired, then all the riches the world could afford. Tormented with these restlesse passions, which was of the King and Courtiers noted, especially of the Lady Phedra , many imagined the cause, yet none so good a Physition to finde the truth, or cause thereof: as continuall care weakeneth the body, and causeth many extreames, so Pheander , feeling in himselfe a weakenes of nature, and looking for some disease, through his melancholy to ensue, finding the king at conuenient time, hee humbly besought him of fauor to depart, alleadging that the aire, & contagiousnes of those cofines, was nothing agreeing with his bodie & that his longer stay might be by his cofusion. The King, which loued him as his owne soule, and tendered his welfare more then all the wealth of his Kingdome, whom he had found so kinde and forward, aduenturing his life for his good in many broyles, though loth to leaue him in whom so much hee delighted, yet noting his melancholike humors, which had much altered his complexion, imagined it was no excuse and therefore the rather condescended to his request, appointing a time as hee desired, when if God sent winde and weather, to be ready with their Shipping, to conduct him to Egypt, whither the King promised wt his Sister and Nobles to accompany him, for which iourney a strickte commaund was giuen all Officers to see each thing necessarie puruaide, which with such diligence was performed, as in short time all things was as they could wish or desire furnished, onely attending a fayre wind to set sayle, which they stayed not long for. But a gale fitting their purpose, the king with his sister, the Maiden knight, and their train embarked themselues for Egypt , where by the good furtherance of him that commaundeth all, they shortly arriued in safety, whose comming being knowne vnto the Uizeroy Cariolus , with such prouision as they could make on the sudden, repayred to the place of landing, where the King ioyfull to see the good recouery of Cariolus , in most kinde manner imbraced him. And so generall welcome being giuen on all sides by the nobles, they passe on towards the Pallace of the king, who with a zealous loue of his Commons, was to his great delight welcommed, with such shewes of ioy, as on the sudden they could prepare. Thus after some time spent in banquetting and other pastimes for their welcomes, to beguile the time the better, the Maiden K. standing on thorns, vntill hee might behold the sweet content of his liues comfort, finding Cariolus in place, where they might discusse at large their minds. The knight not forgetting his promise made to Cariolus in his owne countrey & willing to make amends for the wrong he had there, thus said: My Lord, what I haue to impart vnto you, as one that wisheth your good is such as becommeth a friend vowed to do your Lordsh. What seruice my abilitie ca stretch vnto, onlie I beseech you promise on your Honor to conceale what I shal discouer. Cariolus , who both honored and loued the knight musing to what these speeches tended, relying on the fidelitie of him whom he neuer had heard or seene to commit any dishonourable action, gaue him his word and honor, to bee as secret in all things, as he could desire, which the Knight accepting, thus said. My Lord, first I humblie beseech your fauorable loue to be continued, and pardon my great offence committed against you in Numedia , where my selfe (not being my selfe) I committed a most hainous and dishonourable fault, for which I am willing to make such satisfaction, as you can require. Cariolus hearing the knight make these speeches of submission, noting them well; and bethinking himselfe what had fortuned, being in Numedia , could not call to mind anie vnkindnesse offered him by any inferiour person, neither did he wel remeber the Princes discurtesie, yet leauing nothing vnsought, calling his wits together, bethought him of the Prince, whom he forbare to answere, vntil he had with earnestnes noted the phisiognomie of the Knight, whose face wt long sicknes, wherewith he was at that time possest, was quite altered from the forme it now had, which made him more to admire. But calling to mind the resemblance of the aged king, he conceiued by some signes of his fauour, that it was Dionicius the Prince, yet doubtfull he was, for that being so nobly borne, he came to the Thracian Court, with no better countenance then a Merchant. After wany thoughts, not willing to offend through rashnesse, or to offer any vnkindnes, he humblie besought him in true friendship which he had found, to pardon him, which could not call to mind no wrong done him, nor any familiaritie that euer had been between them. Well my Lord (quoth the knight) I see your minde is free from reuenge, that know not those that haue endaungered your life, and therefore am the more willing to reueale my selfe, to cleare you of this doubt. Know that I am Dionicius , the vnhappy prince of Numedia , who in my fathers court so much abused you, whereof I repent me, & haue sorrowed for it. But pardon me good Cariolus , & accept that friendship I vowed vnto you, which will endeuor to deserue thy Loue in all occasions wherein true loue consisteth. To giue you some cause to credit what I say, I haue thought good to finde this opportunity, not onely to reueale my selfe to you, whose fauor I desire, but to do my best endeuor to deserue the same, and to aduance thy estate, if thou can like of my offer. Cariolus amazed at these speeches, after hee had with more aduised eyes beheld the Prince, was assured it was hee, prostrating himselfe on his knee humbly besought his Grace of pardon, which had so vnreuerently behaued himselfe. But gracious Prince (quoth hee) faults vnwillingly committed, deserue the lesse punishment, I speake for myselfe, which am readie to make amends, in performing any pennance it shal please your Highnes to enioyne me, yeelding many millions of thanks for that fauour you haue vouchsafed, in giuing me that credit to reueale your selfe, to the vnworthiest of manie in high esteeme, which desireth your Highnes knowledge, vowing by the honour of my noble ancestrie, to be gouerned and directed by the Prince Dionicius , and shall (so please it your Highnes, follow your Grace, wheresoeuer it shall stand with your good pleasure to conduct me. The Prince, interrupting his speech, louingly imbraced the Lord Cariolus , giuing him manie thankes for his kind offers, which hee was assured was faithfullie spoken. In recompench of which, my L. qd. he, and to make you som satisfaction for my former wrong offered you, I will endeuour to aduance your estate, so it stand with your good liking, in this manner. You see (my Lord) though with some trouble and effusion of blood on either part, the King in peace and quiet enioyeth his owne Countrey, and with the Crowne of his enemie is likewise inuested. Alluring baites are Kingdomes, & haue mused many Nobles, who not content with their owne estates, to hazard honour, life, and whatsoeuer else they inioyed, to attaine vnto them. But my Cariolus , if thou canst frame thy liking to my wish, and bend thy mind to the loue of Phedra the Princesse, my endeuour shall bee to obtaine her for thy Lady, and the Kingdome of Egypt for her Dowrie, besides, shee is heire to her brother, who dying without issue, shal to higher honors preferre thee. This is all my noble Cariolus , that I haue to say, and (so much I say) for that I wish thy aduancement, if thou like the Lady, and haue not bestowed thy liking elsewhere. Say thy mind, as vnto him which is not onely in this, but in all other matters wherein I may doe thee good, command me. Cariolus , who was wise and weldemeaned, endued with valour and curtesie, as much as might be required, humbly returned manie thanks for this vnexpected good, moued with a desire of kinglie dignity, well content to enioy so braue a Princesse for his loue, without further stay, said: My honoured Lord, I cannot frame my tongue to yeelde such thankes as my hart would vtter, onely this good I craue that your Highnes continue your gracious fauour towards me, whose will shall be euer a law to Cariolus , who will euer be directed by your Maiesties aduise. And seeing most honourable Prince, you haue motion of willingnesse to do mee this good, I humbly beseech you continue it, and binde Cariolus in euerlasting bands of true friendship to your seruice. Here were they interrupted by the comming of the King, who hearing that the Prince was gon that way, delighting in his companie more then in any others, came suddenly on them, yet not in such maner, but he was espied of them. The King which saw them so earnest in their speech, comming vp with them said, Sir Knight, were my Lord Cariolus a Lady, as he is an honourable Gentleman, I should be verie suspitious of you both, that you would finde time to stretch a point farther then became you. In faith Gentlemen (quoth he) as there is brotherlie loue between you, which the world wel noteth let be a trinitie, and accept me for the third perso so shall you honour me more then I will say, and endue mee with such happines as I will not for auoiding of flatterie. Your Maiestie, quoth the Prince may iest, but wold it were knowne vnto your grace, our loues to your Highnes, you might then say, you haue such poore friends of vs, as wil euer wil be ready to aduenture our liues in your honorable seruice Experience good Knight, answered the King, long sithence hath taught me that, whose eyes are witnesses of your loialtie, which I will endeuour to requite, as when you please to make triall you shall finde, especiallie you my Lord, whose bloud lost in venturing for me I can no way requite. Seeing quoth the Prince, your highnesse is thus disposed to iest, pardon I beseech you, what I haue to say, and fauour me so much, as to heare my humble sute, (and hearing) let me obtaine it at your gracious hands, in granting which, your grace shall more honour me then I dare report. Honourabel Knight, answered the King, among friends, what should need distrust, my heart greeueth, that the Noble Knight Pheander , should doubt to obtaine, what euer resteth in my power to grant. Wherefore sweet friend say on, for by the honour of the Thessalian kingdome, whose Crowne I enioy through thy good industrie, what euer thou requirest shall not be denied. Thankes gracious Lord, not for my selfe I intreate, but for this gentleman, whose heart hauing sworne fayaltie to loue, which is the soueraigne guide of all men, hath framed his liking vnto the Princesse Phedra , whose seruant he hath vowed himselfe, if then Noble Prince, it shall stand with your highnesse good pleasure to accept of him, whose honourable birth and haughtie deeds of Chiualrie, may merrit some esteeme with persons of worth, I haue my desire, (by graunting of which,) and obteining the Princesse good liking, I shall be more honoured, then if your grace had inuested me with both the kingdomes of Thessaly and Egipt . Pheander quoth the King, if thou hadst required as much for thy selfe as thy friend, thou couldst not haue honoured me more, whose amitie I desire to participate with, aboue all men of what account soeuer: but seeing thy request is for him whose aduancement I desire, and for thou shalt know in what regard I hold thy loue, I will do my best to procure her loue, women haue fancies, and are headstrong in their affects whether she haue granted her loue I know not, neither can I force her liking, if I could, it were not conuenient, for a forced beast is froward, and women wedded to their will. If in their loue they should be contraried, were better lost then found, their reuenging mindes are such, as they will not be quiet, vntill for their husbands safetie they haue armed his head with such proofe, that hee may walke in safetie amongst the best headed stags in my Forrest. But leauing this iest ( Pheander ) that thou mayest assure thee of my loue my industry shall be to gaine her for thy friend, whom I both honor and loue, and for you my Lord, I giue hearty thanks that will accept of her, whom (I may say) I loue as a brother who, if I can perswade, to your wish, her large dowrie shall testifie. Our pleasant parley hath procured me a good appetite my stomacke telleth me it is dinner time, wherfore Gentlemen, leauing this talke which is as much conquest as the greatest of Hercules , which did neuer conquer woman (vnto me) let vs walke, & doubt not but I will play the Orator in such wise as shall procure your content L. Cariolus , & satisfie your request. Thanks gracious Prince qd. Cariolus , which is all I haue to requite so great a benefite, onely your true Liegeman shall I euer continue, and be ready at your pleasure to do you seruice. How the Thracian King dyed, leauing the Kingdome to the Princesse Nutania: the King of Thessaly wooeth his sister the Princesse Phedra for Cariolus. Here Gentlemen, the Story telleth vs, that the Thracia King (as flesh is mortall) vexed with an extreme sickenesse, was so oppressed therewith, that nature failing through weake age, all Physicke helpes were friuolous, so yt perforce he must pay his due to death which commandeth all, whose breath falling at the summon of this tyrant, which may not be intreated, his soule departed this earthly trunke, to see the ioyes of the euerlasting kingdome, whose death his subiects so with pittious plaints bewayled, as might haue changed the most hardest hart into a Caos of lamenting sorrowes beholding their teares, whose body was most roially intombed amogst his ancestry. But among those which sorrow ouerwhelmed, and had like to haue drowned in deathes gulph ye princesse, who nature forced in some sorte to lament, as a child hauing lost her father, was so weakened with her plaints and hearts sorrow, that long time it was not to be thought she could recouer it, so much was her tender hearte touched, eftsoones bewailing her fathers death, and then againe, grieuing for the want of her Loue and Lord the mayden Knight , of whose safetie whom she more desired the to be Ladie of the whole earth, could not bee perswaded. Long did she languish in these extreames, and could not be comforted, insomuch that shee rather desired death then to liue. But he that in extreames is our best comfort, preserued her for the Commons benefit, sent her health, who being recouered, the Coronation finished, and the Crown by common consent of the Parliament confirmed vnto her, many offers of marriages were made vnto her, for which humble sutes of her Councell were not omitted, who desired nothing more then to haue the issue of her noble body to succeed her. But no perswasions might moue her from the knight, who had the chief interest of her heart, to whom she had vowed her selfe, protesting likewise, neuer to grant her loue or liking to any one but onelie to him. This resolution so much grieued her nobles, that nothing could breed more discontent, yet as duetie commanded, framed themselues to her gouernement, who with such wisedome directed all thinges for the benefit of hir common-weale, that it was admirable to behold that wisedome in one of her sexe. But to returne to our matter. The Thessalian King, who minding his honourable Word with the noble Pheander , finding opportunity, ganne question his sister in this manner. Phedra , since the death of our deare Parents, thou hast beene left vnto my gouernement, for whom, without boast or desire of benefit of thee or any, I haue had that care as of mine owne good, and euer will, so thou bee ruled by me. And for I see thy yeares requireth to bee lincked in marriage, that thou mayest participate in loue with thy husband, and spend the prime of thy yeeres as is fitting thy estate, I haue found a Gentleman of honour and valour, such a one, as on my word loueth thee, and I haue cause for his paines in my seruice imployed to honour. Therefore good sister, if thou loue me as a brother, and hast not bestowed thy loue elsewhere, in this matter bee ruled by me, and in doing whereof, thou shalt finde me thy brother and most assured friend, who will euer be as carefull of thy well doing and honour, as of my good. Say therefore thy mind plainely, and let me know whether thou doest loue, or canst loue? The Lady whose Wisedom was such as balanced her honour, not knowing whether her brother were in iest or earnest, thus modestly sayd: Gracious Lord, and my dread Soueraigne, pardon I humbly beseech you your Subiect, & suffer me not through my fond answering so friuolous a question, which you vrge but for my triall, to procure your displeasure, or my owne shame. Why Phedra , quoth the King, you mistake me, if you thinke I iest, for on my honour, I meane what I say, therefore dallie not with me, if you hope of my good. But tell mee if thou doest loue, or wilt loue my friend? The Lady hearing the King in earnest, although she could bee wel content to haue enioyed the sweet pleasures of loue in marriage, thus sayd: Dread Lord, and my most gracious soueraigne, sithence it is your pleasure I should answere your demand, know, that as modestie is the ornament of maids, and chastitie the garland that beautifieth all our sexe, so haue I carefully waighed mine honour in such maner, that I neither loue, nor as yet euer made choyce of any in loue, but haue eschewed all such friuolous motions of the flesh, to my greatest power, as beseemeth a Lady of such honour. That I may loue, I doubt not, because it is the commaundement of our Maker, and incident to all Creatures, who in their kindes make choyse of some one to participate with: yet shall my loue neuer bee such, as may disparage your highnesse loue towards me, but such as shall be to your content. And for your graces pleasure is to bestow mee on a man so honourable, so standeth it with your will to let me know him, I will answere more directly. God a merry for that Wench qd. the King, then I doubt not but wee shall haue a match, or else thy Wisedome is not such as I wish it were. But tell me vnfeinedly my Phedra , canst thou loue the Lord Cariolus , a man for birth honourable, for valour, to compare with most aduenturing Knightes in the world, in person comely, and so debonnarie in his behauiour, as for curtesie hee is to be matched with the best? Hee is the man Madam, whom if you can fancie, thou honorest mee in thy loue, and thou shalt finde mee a brother, nay a father, if fathers loue may exceed the brothers. Say therefore thy minde, and let me know thy answere? The Ladie whose hope was, her brothers sute had bene for the Mayden Knight , with whose loue she was a little touched, yet modestie maistering such fond motions would not let affection take such roote, but that she could at her pleasure expell it. After the Lady had heard her brother, whom she perceiued by his earnestnesse in vttering his sute, would not willingly be denied, she said: Pardon me my good Lord, if I passe modestie, considering your great praise of the Gentleman, beleeue me, hee is much beholding vnto your Grace, who could haue thought you would haue prooued so good a soliciter? had your studie bene the Lawes of this Realme, no doubt but you should haue had many Clyants: were the Gentleman here himselfe, he could not haue said thus much, and therefore he may thinke himselfe beloued and honoured of your highnesse. But for answere, as I would not haue you in your first wooing disgraced, least it discourage you in your owne enterprises beeing a batcheler, so can I say little of my selfe, who is to be gouerned by you, to whom in all humblenesse I referre me, and shall so you be pleased, be content, (if it were with one not so worthie as the Lord Cariolus , And yet.) Nay Madam, quoth the King, leaue not off so abruptly with an aparentizes, your words are doubtful. Tell me therfore, is there any other before me? if there be, and thou hast made choyce, (and you both agreed) I will not gainesay it, nor tie thee to any other then thy owne content in marriage. Therefore say, what those words (and yet) imported? Pardon my ouerboldnesse, gracious Lord, answered the Princesse, which vnaduisedlie ouerpast those speeches, & credit my word, which haue no loue fixed in my heart, but will endeuour my selfe to the liking of him whome you shall commaund me, yet will I answere your demaund, and meaning of those words, taken so by your Grace at rebound, though I must and will, frame me to the loue and liking of the Lorde Cariolus . Yet had the noble Generall been pleased, and with that a deepe sigh stayed her tongue, in such wise, as she could goe no farther. The King vnderstanding which way the wind of her desire blew, though he could haue been better content with hir choyce, yet to put her from other thoughts, and to haue his sute take effect, he perswaded her to let slip such fond imaginations, for that he had placed his loue on a Lady of his coutrey, whom he would not leaue for all the world, With these happie tidings for the Lord Cariolus , after some other kinde speeches to the Lady, the King departed, so ioying in his good successe, that he could not rest vntill hee had comforted the Lord Cariolus with his answere: whose mind egged on by the Mayden knight, was so fixed on the Lady, that shee was become the mistresse of his heart, and he ioyed in nothing but in contemplating of hir loue, thinking euery day a yeere, and euerie houre a month, vntill he heard the Kings answer, musing thus on his Loue, tossed with a minde disquieted, from one side the bed to the other, his Page brought him Worde, that a Gentleman from the King attended to speake with him, which suddaine newes reuiued so his spirits, as made his heart more light, then long time before it had beene, hoping to heare such happie tidings as his louing sute required. The messenger hauing deliuered his message, iudge you that bee Louers, whether you could slacke any time vntill you heard the doome of your Mistresse, which hee was assured to doe by the King, vnto whome hee hastneth with such speed as he could, To whose presence being come, the King as ioyfull for his good successe and his sisters grant, as the Lord Cariolus to hear it, with a smiling countenance, which shewed the ioy of his heart, said, My Lord, though my skill in wooing bee but small, hauing neuer accustomed my selfe to any such practise, yet haue I played the cunning Aduocate for your Lordshippe, and wil assure you, so you hold your word and promise, the Princesse shall be yours, and thereon take my Worde of Honour. Cariolus so ouerioyed at these tidings, could not well tell whether he heard the King speake, or dreamed of this happinesse. But standing a while in an extasie, his sences being come againe, with eyes gastly beholding the King, thus said My honourable and gracious Lord, what may I doe to requite your Princely fauour, who hath vouchsafed mee so great honour, not onely to bestow your onely sister on mee, but to become my honourable soliciter, what I would say, modestie compelleth me to conceal. Only this I assure your Maiestie, my loiall seruice shall euer be ready at your commaund, in such dutifull maner, that your Maiestie shal haue no cause to repent of so great a good done to a stranger. Enough my Lord, few words doth suffice among friends, wherfore forbeare those speeches, loue my sister, and for her sake, thinke of me as a friend, which will be euer readie to do you what pleasure I can, To giue you some interest of my faith, appoint the marriage day at your pleasure, & for her Dowrie accept this Kingdome of Egypt , which shall remaine to you, your heires for euer, onely this, homage shall you yearelie tender in my Court of Thessaly , two swift running coursers of this countrey, and so God make you happie in your loue, and a ioyfull father of many children. With this the Maiden knight entered his presence, vnto the King, what man so welcome, his dutie done, the King louingly imbracing him, said, Sir Knight, I haue not long sithence comforted your friend with my happy tidings, and not onelie assured him of a Wife, which I hope will proue louing & kind vnto him, but haue inuested him with the title of King of Egypt , of both which, I wish him so much ioy, as I desire to haue ioy, his Wedding day let him appoint at his pleasure, which shall with the greatest honour I can, bee performed. Most gracious and dread Lord, quoth the knight, how this your honourable curtesie hath tied me vnto your seruice, I omit, that at my request hath thus fauoured my deare friend, whose good I esteeme as mine owne, and euer wil bee readie with my best endeuour to serue, at all times & places where my force or seruice may doe, eyther your Maiestie or my Lord Cariolus good. And seeing it is wrought to his content, and your Graces good liking, let me entreat this fauour of you both, that the Wedding day may suddenly be solemnized, for that my stay may not be long here, such desire I haue to see my Soueraigne Lord, who I am sure expecteth my returne long before this time. Syr (quoth the King) did you know how displeasing those speeches of your departure were to mee, that desire nothing in the whole World so much as your company, you wold neuer harpe so much on that string. But how long soeuer your stay shall bee, this day eight daies I doe appoint for the Wedding, so my Lord Cariolus bee agreed, and say Amen . Neuer (qd. Cariolus ) let him bee allowed for Clark, which refuseth to say Amen , to such a Parson, the Orizons bringing such content, seeing your Maiestie referres it to me, Amen say I, and humblie thanke your Grace for your honorable fauour. The Wedding day appointed and assigned, the king sent for the Princesse, who that night supped all together, which being ended, the Princesse in presence of many of the Lords of Thessaly and Egypt was betrothed vnto the Lord Cariolus , and the Marriage day appointed, against which time, were all the Nobles summoned to be at Court, to attend ye King, by whose commandement all the preparation for honour of that day might be deuised, was ordained the time of night being spent, summoned their watchfull eies to sleepe, wherfore after manie solemn Adues, taken one of the other they hastened on all sides to their rest, onelie Cariolus & the Princesse best content, shee ioying in her loue, and kinglie Brothers liking, and hee blessing a million of times the day wherein he first saw the Prince, procurer of his so great good, What other imaginations assayled them, let those suppose and thinke which haue felt the sweet content in Loue. To which I leaue them, to recount vnto you the sorrow of the Thracian Queene, who ruling with honour, beloued both of Pheeres and Commons, in as much royaltie as might be desired, endured so manie sundry torments of minde, wanting her most desire that the day was irkesome vnto her, and the night ordained for rest, restlesse shee consumed, that with her continuall watchings, and other passions, her body became weake, and a grieuous sicknesse assayled her, the cause no ma could imagine, neither might Physicke minister any cure to her disease: so that giuen ouer to the death, she languished in great extremities, not daring for modesty, to reueale the cause, onely this was her chiefest comfort, when she could be freed from the company of such Ladies & Counsellers, which visited her, with Guenela to recount her loue, sometime extolling his valour and person, and eftsoones accusing him of disloyaltie, exclaiming on her hard Fortune, which had engaged her libertie to a Knight, carelesse of her honour & good, cursing and accusing Guenela , being soliciter for such a wretched knight, whose speeches oftentimes was to answered by her Mayden Guenela , as in iesting wife would shee turn her wordes of despight into laughter, such was the sharpnesse of her wit, which left no meanes vnsought, that might procure in the least manner her content. Oppressed with griefe (we leaue the Princes for a while) to returne to Cariolus , whose Wedding day being come, great was the ioy on his side, but more the preparation of al courtiers, who were ready with many costly shews at Tilt, Turney, and Barriers, to trie their valour and fortunes in Armes. But as the fayrest day is ouercast with cloudes, so was their mirth changed to great & grieuous lamentations, and their ioy to sorrowfull complaints, which thus befell. The King now in prime of years, desirous to try his force at the Tilt with his presence, to honour his Nobles, and doe the Princesse fauor at her Marriage in these pastimes, made choyce of the Mayden Knight , to encounter him, as the worthyest in Armies, who being of all others most vnwilling to deale against him, humbly besought his Grace of pardon, and accept of some his Nobles who was more worthyer of that honor. But the King, with whom no intreaties might preuaile, would not be denyed, which made the Knight with great heauinesse of heart, to wish he had not Armed him that day, such was his discontented minde, which doubtlesse presaged some great ensuing euill, as to the great geiefe of all the whole company hapned them. Thus when no denials might preuaile, the Trumpets sounding a charge, they set forwards with such swiftnes as the earth trembled vnder their horses, both breaking their staues in such maner, as all the company with ioyfull shoutes applauded their excellent skill in that exercise. But alas (in midst of this pleasing practise) how suddeinly their ioyes were eclipsed, woe is me to recount. The King and his elected Companion, at the trumpets sound, setting with courage forward to encounter the one the other, in braue manner brake againe their slaues, but in an vnhappie time a splinter of the Knights staffe, by most vnfortunate chaunce entered the sight of the Kings Beauer, which pierced the head to the brain; in such wise, yt wich the heat of his trauell and griefe of ye wound, he was enforced to forsake his horse. This sudden mishap, to the company brought such discontent, that all their mirth was layde apart, sorrow was Lady of the Feast. But amongst those that most lamented this vnfortunate chaunce, the Mayden knight had his parte, whose griefe was such, that had not the L. Cariolus bin by fortune present, in the extreame of his melancholy passion he had ssaine himselfe: such was the wisdome of the noble Cariolus , whose reasonable perswasions preuayled so with him as he caused him forsake his dolefull ledge, to accompany him to the presence of the King whose masters of Chirurgery had newly ended the trauell of dressing his woundes, then the Knight questioned of the daunger thereof, and besought them in curtesie to acquainte him therewith, whether he helde it mortall or no? which how vnwilling soeuer they were, as loath to discomfort the King or those which loued him, such was the curteous entreatie of the Knight, as hee could not conceale the daunger thereof, but reuealed vnto him the little hopes they had of his life, and the reasons that inouced them thereunto, which newes was little pleasing vnto the Knight, who with many teares lamented that mishap, but griefe ministreth no Physicke to the diseased, nor sorrow auaileth not to mittigate extreames. Wherfore by Cariolus comforted, hee ceaseth in so exceeding manner to lament, determining to abide the Kings doome, vnto whom he purposeth to reconcile himselfe, and to that intent awaiteth the waking of his Maiestie, who was after his dressing falle asleepe, whose griefe was such, as he could take small rest. But rowsing himselfe, awaked from his slumber, calling for the Lord Cariolus who was wayting only for the same purpose, vnto whom being come, he saith. Cariolus , let no man boast himselfe of happines which is mortall, for that they are subiect to crosses, and casuall mishaps, as thy selfe maiest witnesse with me, and many others, that haue seene this mischaunce befallen me, when I least expected it; the originall of my griefe proceeding from my selfe, which would inforce my good friend to the action whereunto he was so vnwillingly drawne: but what Heauens haue ordained, what man can gainesay? The Omnipotent power of the Almightie, hath laide his crosse on mee, for my greater good, to call me from these worldes vanities, to seeke his euerlasting Kingdome: Yet ere I leaue this fraile life, sweete Cariolus , let me see that honorable Knight, by whose handes death sent his sommance, deare he was vnto me, and his loue worthy to be imbraced of the mightiest Monarke. Oh Pheander , couldest thou but imagine with what faithfull loue I loued thee, thou maiest sorrow for my losse, whom thou and all the world cannot reclaime from this great hazard wherein I remaine. With this, the Knight which was not far off, presented himselfe vnto him, who kneeling at his beds side, saide. Most gracious Soueraigne, might my grieued hart which ouerwhelmed in sorrow is sowced in a sea of many miseries, consume it selfe with griefe, for my euill committed against you, how happie a creature were I, which haue bene the occasion of your Highnesse so great vnrest, yet how vnwilling, Heauens record with me? And therefore (my dread Soueraigne) pardon my fault, so vnwillingly committed against your Maiestie, as deare to me as mine owne soule, whose life is ten thousand liues depended thereon, I wish might be sacrificed for thy health, and the louing subiects of my gracious Soueraigne, whom by my ouerhardinesse, I haue robbed of so louing a Prince. Let me I say, chiefe causer of your sorrow, reape the guerdon due to a murtherer, and reuenge your Kings death, by taking my life, which had I a million of liues could not make satisfaction for my euill committed against you. Here tears interrupting him, denying his tongue liberty of speech, whose lamentatio filled all the Nobles with such heauinesse, as for teares, they could not vtter a word, especially the King, whose griefe being great, was increased by his dolefull lament, yet casting off this womanish humor, drying his eyes, doubting the Nobles and those present, should accuse him of feare, (dreading to die) whereunto we all are borne with a soft voyce, tederly wringing ye Mayden Knight by the hand, he saith: Noble Gentleman, sease thy heauinesse, thy griefe so augments mine, that the thought thereof, wrings teares from my heart: thy vnwilling offence, with my heart I forgiue, and to shew how deare in life thou wast vnto me, (my good Pheander ) accept at my dying hand, my Kingdom of Thessalie , the lawfull inheritance of thy faithfull friend, loue those people, my kinde Subiects, and so gouerne them with fauour and lenitie, as they haue no cause to complaine of my dead coarse, and for my life, which by thy hand, through the appointment of him that gaue it me, I must leaue, I heartilie forgiue thee, & accursed be he or them, which shall euer impute vnto thee, in dishonor any fault against me committed. That thou louest me, thy tender care of my good hath shewed such proofes, as tyed me in true friendship to be thine for euer. Death is not so irkesome vnto mee, but that I must leaue thee, & the sweete content I receiued in thy company, griefe of my deaths griefe, my owne Pheander , compelleth mee omit what I would say, wherefore briefly thus, Forget not thy dying friend, and shew that loue to the Lord: Cariolus , whome for thy sake, I haue to this Crowne of Egipt aduanced, as I euer found, and in extreams comfort him with thy aide as thou hast done me: My sister Phedra forget not, whom to thy charge I commit (leauing her to thee) & thee to be in my place a brother, who liuing loued her as my hope is thou wilt. And so deare friends (Heauens blessednes befall you all) and so prosper you, as I loued you. And you Pheres of Egipt and Thessaly , whose loue I haue found as Subiects in all dutifull manner, let be continued vnto these your elected Kings, who will with honor gouerne you, so shall the giuer of all happines blesse you & your lands, with ye blessing of peace and plenty: for they that honour their King, doth reuerence the Lord who created him, and hee will giue them plenteous rewards. Noble Gentlemen, griefe cutteth me off, flesh must yeelde to earth how loath soeuer: the mightiest, death hath vanquished. Therefore as my Vltimum vale , remember my words, & pray God to send vs the abundance of his grace, that we may through his mercy, haue a ioyfull meeting in his Kingdome that neuer shall haue ende. I feele the heauie messenger approching, therefore Farewell to thee my deare sister, whom I charge as thou louedst mee liuing, be louing and kinde to thy husband dooing him that honor is due vnto him, thy children bring vp in feare of their Maker, and so God blesse thee with happines. And thou Pheander , vnto me no creature in life more deare, remember my parting speeches, loue the Lord Cariolus as I haue loued thee, & thou my adopted brother Cariolus , honor him during thy life, yt I am sure faithfully tedered & loued thee, so shal God be pleased, for no sin in sight of his diuine Deitie, is more intollerable, then that monstrous vice of Ingratitude, which for auoiding the heauy wrath of God, I wish thee to eschue. Nobles and you all my very good friends, to exhort you to remeber your duties, whose wisedomes is more then I will recount, were a matter friuolous, and perhaps may moue som offence, yet take my simple meaning (which speake to you that haue ouerloued me,) which loue let it be continued; honour your King with reuerence & loue, for what you doe to the is done to God, which are his Uizegerents on earth, and his annointed: Mooue no rebellion, nor be maintainers of euill, for such faults, how secret so euer, God will to your ouerthrow reueale. Remember his word, which hath commaunded you to bee obedient, without murmuring, and feare him which gouerneth all. I can say no more, my speech fayleth me, therfore generally my Lords, Farewell: and so turning his weak body to the wall, surrendred his soule to the Heauens, fro whence it had his being, to the intollerable griefe of all his Subiects, who with many brinish teares lamented his death, but especially the knight Pheander and Cariolus , whose Marriage the louing King honoured with his funerall, which in the most honorablest maner, Art or honour could deuise, was solemnized lamented generally of all his Subiects, but especially the Egyptians, who more dearely loued him for his clemency then their owne naturall King. How the Mayden knight hauing setled the K. Cariolus in his kingdomes, well furnished with a Fleet of gallant Gallyes arriued in Thrace, and was welcommed of the Lord high Admirall Amintas, who mette him in the Harbourght. The Funeral finished, a Parliament was summoned, in the which time the Maiden knight so preuailed with ye Nobles of Thessaly and Egypt , that by common conset of the whole assembly in both houses, temporall and spirituall, the regiment of both kingdoms was deliuered vnto the Lord Cariolus and the Mayden knight , resigned his interest for euer vnto him and the Lady, who was lawfull inheretrix vnto the same, The Parliament proroged according to the custome of the Country, great preparation was made for the Coronation, which in most solemne and honorable manner, was accomplished, with so many sundry shews and delightfull pleasures, as might wearie you to read. Let it suffice, to the great ioy of both Realmes, all things to so honorable an action, was so exquisitely performed, as no man but took great delight in beholding therof, praying wt an vniuersall voyce, for their long liues, to be in happines amongst the continued Thus all thinges to the ioy of the Noble Pheander accomplisht, and to the high content of King Cariolus , and his Q. by the aduise of the mayden Knight , an election was made of a Uizeroy to go for Thessaly , the King making choyce of two euils the least, conceiuing this opinion of the naturall subiects of Thessalie , that they would liue in their dutifull obeisance, when a conquered nation gathering head vpon many light occasions, was easily driuen to reuolt. These considerations with great wisedome weyed, the L. Ferdinand one of the priuie Councell of Thessaly was elected for that gouernment, vnto whom the King after his commission signed, and honorable gifts giuen, so wisely exhorted to obedience, and care of his loue and duty, that as many of the Nobles as were present, and noted the same, admired him, reioycing that God had prouided so for them, to leaue them in the gouernement of so toward a Prince, of whome so much ensuing happines was expected. Order taken for his affayres of waight, the Uizeroy enbarked for Thessalie , and his Nobles departed, each one vnto their seuerall mansions, sauing such of his Priuy counsel, which were attendant at the Court. The Noble Pheander was now to take his leaue, the remembrance whereof was more offensiue to the King and Queene, then al their former troubles. Bootlesse it was to intreat his longer stay, who standing on thornes till his desire was obtained, in beholding the most beautifull Princesse, might no longer be perswaded, wherefore the King to honour him the more, by who he was for euer honored, caused a Fleet to be prepared of 20. Gallyes, whome by his strict commandement, was most royally furnished with all needfull Uyands and other necessaries for his voyage, which on such suddaine was purueyed as might wel shew their diligence to whom that great charge was committed. All things ready for his departure, & a fayre wind blowing a fresh and comfortable gale, these friendes were now to depart. After leaue taken of the Princesse, who with many brinish tears bewayled the same, the king with his Pheeres accompanied him to the water side, where his copany appointed to attend him, awayted his comming, where after heauy parting on both sides, and many teares spent of the commos which beheld their sorrowes, he imbarked himselfe, and by the good fauour of the winds, and diligent industry of his mariners, suddenly lost sight of land, and had the wind so fauorable, that in short time they attained the sight of the high land of Thrace , with which they beare all that they might, yet could not possibly recouer their Port that night. This Fleet of Gallies being on the shore descryed, none could imagine what they were or should bee, to preuent the worst, the Councell carefull of their owne safeties, and commons good, assembled the power of their City, making prouision for defence what euer hapned. The Master of the Admirall not daring to enter the harbourght by night, laye off againe into the Sea, hulling vntil the day watch was in land, at which time they set sayle to goe for their harbourght, and by fauourable assistance of the windes recouered the same. After the Sunne had shewed her selfe in her beauty two houres, to suruey which power, and to giue notice to the Queene what they were, the L. Amintas , Lord high Admirall of the Land, was in a Frygotte sent who bouging as much as the force of his staues would permit him. being a man honourable and venterous, not knowing what they were, whether friends or enemies, came vp with the Admirall, and layd her aboord, of whose comming the Maiden knight being aduertised, doing him duty, caused his Flagge to be furled, and his Auncient to bee taken downe, whose order the whole Fleete followed. When the Admirall saw the Knight Pheander , whose welfare they greatly doubted, betweene them was much reioycing and many imbracings, as friends ioyful to see one ye other: passing in pleasant Parley the time, they came to anchor, at which time, according to directions giuen by the Knight, all their ordinance was discharged, with their seuerall Artillery, reioicing according to the sea maner, for their safe arriuall, to the great admiration of all the beholders, which could imagine no certainetie what they were: no sooner was the Ancors a ground, but the Lord Admirall causing his Frygot to come aboord, entered the same, accompanied with the Mayden knight , and other Nobles of Thessaly and Egypt , which came to accompanie him, as Embassadors from the King, who were all most roiallie intertained of the Nobles, which attended their landing, and were conducted to the Court, where according to their Estates they were sumptuouslie lodged in the Court, & like order taken for puruaying for their traine. Amongst others that had enquired the newes of these strangers, and what they were: Guenela by chance, as women are inquisitiue of nouelties, had with diligence learned what those Nobles so royally entertained were, with the arriuall of the Maiden knight , who was no sooner knowne vnto the ioyfull Maiden, (made more ioyfull by these happie tidings) but standing on thornes vntill shee came to the Presence of the Queene, doubting least her newes should bee so stale before shee came, as it would bee scarce woorth the carriage, she omitted no time. To whome being come, and finding the Queene in her accustomed melancholie passions, though now some way otherwise imployed about the imaginations of those strangers, to put hir from hir study, thus said. What Madam, euer in your Memento , in faith were I of your priuy counsel, and might perswade with you, I wold wish your Maiesty become Lady of some Nunnerie, where you might haue company, since nothing may delight you but contemplation. Guenela , quoth the Queen, cease thy fond talke at this time, and giue mee leaue, who haue matters of waight to imploy me on. If it be so Madam, (quoth Guenela ) I am to craue pardon for my boldnesse, otherwise, if it might not haue been offensiue, I could haue acquainted your Highnes with some newes of the Mayden knight , which because I see it is troblesome vnto you hauing busines, I beseech your Grace to licence me to depart, vntill it shall please your Ladiship to find leasure to heare me. The Queen hearing her name the Maiden knight , was so waked from her dumpes, as she called Guenela , and with earnest intreaties besought her to let her know, what news she heard of those strangers, and what moued her to name the Mayden knight. Madam (quoth Guenela ) if your Ladiship would haue permitted me to speake, I had without farther delayes, acquainted you with such newes of these strangers, as I heare and haue diligently enquired, who are Nobles of Thessaly , in Embassage for the King, accompanied with the best welcomed Knight in Affrica , the peerelesse Pheander , your Graces sworn seruant, ye naming of whom so reuiued the Queen that hee that had the word sight might haue perceyued how pleasing these newes were vnto her, yet doubtfull of her Maydens speeches which had often deluded her, to moue delight, she said: Guenela , thou hast more pleasure in feeding mee with vaine hopes, then hath contented me, yet haue I borne thy follies, imagining in what sort they were vsed. But now Guenela leaue thy Iests, least they grow odious, and moue me to chollor against thee, which would not willinglie bee drawne vnto. Therefore tell me without dallying, is my Knight arriued with these Nobles, or is there certain tidings of his good health by these strangers. Madam (quoth Guenela ) if my ouerboldnesse haue incurred your displeasure, I humbly craue pardon, who had no intent to offend, hee witnesse with me, which searcheth my deepest secrets, but to assure you of what you so much desire Know Madam, the mayden Knight is with these Nobles arriued, who, as I heare, are come from the Lord Cariolus , who by procurement of the mayden Knight is married with the Princesse of Thessaly , and is royally crowned by consent of both Realmes, lawfull King of Thessaly and Egypt , the one, his Queenes lawfull inheritance, the other, the late Kings bequest, who by vnhappy fortune, hath left this life. Thus Madam haue I acquainted your highnesse with what I haue heard, the truth thereof beeing prooued, I hope will procure my pardon. Guenela , (quoth the Queene) ten thousand times I thanke thee for thy tidings, which I will so requite, as it shall be the best newes that euer passed thy mouth, to giue thee some assurance thereof, take this Diamond, which shee pulling from her finger, deliuered her, and looke for a better reward. The hastie approaching of the Councell, interrupting their speech, caused them cease their farther parley, who staying the Queenes pleasure, sent her word, they had some matter to impart vnto her, who were presently admitted to her Presence, accompanied with the Mayden Knight . The Councell hauing done their duties, the mayden Knight presented himselfe vnto her Maiesty, whose sight so apalled her as she could say nothing, shamefast modesty striuing with her willingnesse to bid him welcome, which shee could not doe as she would, least her countenance should disclose her hearts desire, yet not omitting such honourable fauour as she could do him, she offered her hand to kisse, which in all humblenesse hee accepted, acknowledging his most bounden duty to her Highnesse, whom she questioned in this manner. Seruant, quoth she, we had thought your liking had been such to the Dames of Thessaly , as we should haue been inuited to your wedding, or that your entertainement had bin so euill in our Court as you were weary of the same, that you haue thus long absented yourselfe from our presence, (vnder Benedicity ) seruant, as you ow duty to your Mistresse, make me your ghostly father, and before my Lords here present, tell mee and dissemble not, what hath beene the cause of your long stay. Gracious Soueraign, quoth the Knight, if I answer what is truth, I hope your Maiesty will accept it, and pardon mee, if in my harsh answere I passe those duties which I woulde not willingly doe. For my loue to forraine Ladies, I may iustlie deny, which neyther saw any since my departure from your confines, in whose presence I tooke pleasure: During my long stay, how vnwilling that hath been, I call to record these Nobles strangers, which can testifie my long desire to haue tendered my dutifull seruice vnto your Highnes, wherunto I am bound. Therfore dread Lady, pardon my offence therein, who being at a forren Princesse commandement, must obey it. Well seruant quoth the Queene, I must giue credite to your words, else should I doe you wrong, but howsoeuer, you are welcom to your Mistresse, who is a debtor of yours. The sight of this Noble Physitian, wrought more effectes then all the medicines Art could minister, whose presence quite expelled all former cares from her Princelie heart, though her body weakened with her long languishing, could not be so suddenly restored. But time and short time, with the comfort shee conceiued of her louing Prince, restored her to her former health, as you shall heare in the ensuing history. Now return we to the Nobles who awayted her Highnesse pleasure, for which, the Queene counting of her speech with the Knight thus said, Honourable Lords, if it be no matter of counsell, for which your comming is at this time, let vs know the cause, my seruant I dare commit some trust vnto, who shall participate of these your affayres. Mighty Princesse, (quoth the Lord Parsinio ) matter of state concerning the gouernment or affaires of your Common-weale, we haue not to vtter, but onelie do beseech your Highnes, to commaund for your Honour, that these noble Strangers be entertained according to their estates, with such curtesie and bountie, that they may haue cause to speake of your Court and honorable entertainment as of a worthy deseruing Prince: And more, to doe your Noble subiects honour, the Lord Cariolus , who by marriage of the deceased Kings sister: is crowned lawfull king, both of Thessaly and Egypt . This is all most gracious Lady, wherof if you please to conceiue, and giue order for the same accordinglie, you shall highly honour vs your Subiectes, & gaine to yourselfe the famous reporte of strangers, which is the garment that beautifieth Princes, and gouernors of states. Thankes Noble Gentlemen (quoth the Queene,) for your honourable care of vs, which are not acquainted with anie such matters, wherefore I beseech you my L. Parsinio , to keepe them company during their stay here, let my Officers attend them, and their allowance be such, as may not impaire our bountifull mind, thereby to deserue honour, (if feasting be honourable) especially, let their Traine bee well purueyed for, both in large allowace of Uiands and lodging for those are they by whom fame will ring, being of the baser sort, either of honor or dishonour, as for their Embassage we will omit the hearing, vntill God endue vs with some more strength, and so farewell. The Nobles hauing done their duties, and gone, it may be imagined, whether the Knight departed with content or no, on whom the Queene bestowed so gracious a looke, as he might well iudge of his welcome, but commaund his longer stay shee would not, to auoide the suspition of iealousie, or that her loue should bee in the least sort suspected. Contented with the sight of her beloued, after their departur, commaunding the rest of the Company from her, detayning onlie Guenela between them began som pleasant parley, wherin, first the Queene, and then Guenela , descanted at theyr pleasure of the Knight, omitting no iesture hee vsed in his speech, his person, and what else greatly delighted the Princesse, who would often say, how mannerlie is my seruant become? yea, quoth Guenela , it is hard to say, whether he lerned the same of man or woman, nay on my word, quoth the Princesse, I dare acquit him, for any company keeping with women, his maydenlie blush, assureth me that he hath learned no courting fashions of the Thessalian Ladies ( Credo ) quoth Guenela , and Madam so euer belieue for a good beliefe is a step to saluation, or by my hollidoome your chiefeste Chaplaine is not so iust a man as hee ought to bee. Thus pleasantlie discoursing, we leaue them, to recount vnto you the roiall intertainement of the Thessalian Nobles and their traine. The Lord Parsinio , to whome the Queene had deliuered this charge as you haue heard, tooke such care in performance thereof, that as he was Noble, and euerie way endued with honourable conditions, so was his care, in discharge of that trust committed vnto him, as the Nobles admired their roiall cheare, their diuersitie of sports to beguile time, with costlie shewes, each accident so exquisitely performed as the thoughts and imaginations thereof, mooued those straunge Nobles, when the companie had left them to their rests, in contemplating of their gracious entertainment, to consume sometime the most of the night, admiring the bounty of the Queene, whom they with earnest mindes desired to see: As these Nobles consumed their time with pleasure, which made it seeme the shorter, so the Queene which had eare for receyuing their message, after the first sight of her seruant, began so to comfort her selfe, that with those comfortable confections her Doctors prouided, and receiuing such Uiands as Phisicke thought most meetest: she beganne to recouer her decaied colour, and her faint limbes euerweake with forbearing such sustenance, wherewith Nature should be relieued, recouered their strength in such wise, as it ioyed her subiects to heare of her recouerie. Time which ouercommeth mightie things, hath brought the Queene to that good estate, as finding a day wherein the Sunnes power, vanquished the aires rumaticke coldnesse, shee walked into the garden, where she solaced herselfe, beholding Natures abiliments, which beautified the earth in such maner, that the pleasantnesse thereof, with the sweete smels bred her great content. How the Knight wayting opportunity, met the Queene in her garden of pleasure, and their parley, and what hapned betweene the Knight and Guenela. The Mayden Knight which had desire to shew his dutie in attending her royall highnesse, hearing this happie tidings, hastneth to the garden, whome the Queen no sooner saw, but calling him vnto her, after his duty done, and her Maiesty taking him vp fro the ground from off his knee, shee said, My Lord, what excuse can you frame now, for neglecting your dutie to your Mistresse, which cannot haue your sight being in Court, without a Messenger, if the sight of any one attending vs, bee offensiue to your Grace, we will remooue them, rather then loose your company, so wee may knowe them. Noble Princesse, answered the Knight, that I acknowledge not my duty as I ought, pardon mee, and weigh in the ballance of your gracious clemencie, my zeale and harty desire to doe your seruice, who albeit my heart desireth no such happinesse as your Princely presence, yet knowing that Princes haue many eyes to behold them, and enuy lurketh in the hearts of Subiects, who imagining more, then is on either of our parts thought, may with their euill speech rayse that scandall, as may blemish your renowne beeing a Uirgin, and procure my greater trouble which am a stranger. Clenly excused quoth the Queene, I see now good seruant you haue not spent your time idely abroad, if I might know your Schoole mistresse, I would be so bold to thanke her, for the diligent applying her scholler. Madam, quoth the Prince, I am glad to heare your grace so well disposed, I hope your Maiestie hauing recouered strength, and your businesse with these Nobles ouerpast, wil thinke of your seruant, and remember your word to mee, which challengeth the same at your Maiesties hands. My Lord (quoth she) had I not held thy loue in regarde, I could not haue denied the many sutes of my Pheres and Commons which haue besought me, and with great ernestnes entreated me to mariage, but so deare hath thy loue been vnto me, that I desired death, rather then falsifie my faith to your Grace, for whom, and through whose vnkindnesse, I haue endured much hearts discontent. No more of that quoth the Knight (good Madame) expell from your mind passed griefes, and thinke vpon the ensuing pleasures which will exceed all the discontent hath beene: to heare your discontent, is little pleasing vnto me, who neuer closed these, nor neuer beheld the rising of the glorious Sun, without millions of times remembring your Grace, whose presence I more desired then I will explane. Guenela seeing some of the Councell entring the Garden, gaue them intelligence thereof, breaking off their speech thus. Syr, if you haue taken orders in holie Church since your departure, it is more then is expected of all the Court, which in time past haue shewed your selfe so worthilie in Arms, to your lasting honor. If you haue, and her Grace haue chosen for her ghostlie father, enioine I beseech you, her Maiestie to some easie penance, for her log sicknes is not to endure much fasting, besides here is of the Councell, who hath waited to say something eyther to the Queene or your Grace. These words of Guenela caused them surcease their talk, and with shewes of louing countenances, to giue each other the farewell. The knight framing his talke to Guenela , who finding him alone, thus said: Sir, experience of mine owne discontent hath taught me, what a corosiue Melancolie is, to a pleasing minde, who in your absence hath endured manie sharpe words: yea, & oftentimes those thundering speeches, lighting with blowes either on my ribbes, head, or face, (in reuenge of which) had you been present, for whose sake I endured the, I should haue aduentured the cracking of a sword wt your grace, or greatlie haue wanted of my wil. Why how now Guenela (quoth the Knight) art thou metamorphosed? hath the Goddesse ioined thee abiliments of a man, as well as armed thy heart with courage (faire wench) art thou so valiantlie minded to breake a blade? take heede, tis dangerous for your sexe to deal with weapons, but I wil desire the Queen to search you, lest happilie as bad a chaunce befal her maids, as Dania which entertained Iupiter , in likenesse of a Swan, If Guenela bee likewise by their consents alienated from her sexe, it were good to preuent euils in time had I wist, commeth too late. My Lord (qd. Guenela ) blushing with shame, your Lordship hath through my fondnes, taken me at aduantage, miscostruing my simple meaning, which haue euer honored you. Conceale my follie in this, good my Lord & forget it, and pardon my fond words, which haue felt many stripes for you. Nay Guenela , (quoth the Knight) I may not with mine honour let passe a matter of such importance, without reuealing it vnto her Highnesse, lest your words (as you say) spoken in ieast, turn some of our Ladies in earnest: to be beholding to mother Midwife. The Queene which had reposed herselfe, with beholding the beautie of nature, and taking the pleasant ayre, which did greatly comfort her, hauing some conference with her Nobles, departed the garden, which made the rest with all the speed they could make to follow: whereof Guenela was nothing sorrowfull, who was therby copeld to leaue the knight of whom she wished long before to haue shut her hands. The Queene gathering some strength, was loath to detaine the strange Nobles any longer from her Presence: wherefore by her Nobles she limitted a time to heare them; against which day, were all her Nobles summoned to bee at Court, wt her Ladies, and women of most account, to attend her Maiesty, who with the Lord Steward of her Houshold, had taken such order for all diuersity of Uiands that might be prouided. The day appointed come, not vnexpected of the straungers, who prouided themselues as sumptuous as they could, apparelled after their Country manner, attended the time of her Maiesties comming forth, who being come, and in her Chayre of Estate seated, word was brought vnto the straungers, who marching with the Nobles of Thrace , thorough the Court, were in most honorable manner presented vnto her Maiestie, who with countenance debonnaire , and grace Maiesticall, as became her royaltie, bad them all welcome, in such curteous and Princely manner, that the strangers at this first sight were driuen to great admiration, beholding that grace and honour in a woman, which they would neuer haue belieued, had not their eyes bene witnesses. The Queene hauing giuen them these honorable welcomes, each man taking his place, Ormania , the chiefest in Commission from their King, thus sayd. Magnificent Prince, our King, your Highnesse late subiect, acknowledging his humble duty to your Excellence, hath sent vs his Liege men and sworne Seruants, to signifie the same: who in faithfull loue voweth, neuer to be alienated in minde from that duty, which becommeth each naturall subiect to owe his Prince and Countrey. By vs hee presents his offer of seruice, which shall be with all his power ready, at your Highness pleasure: the rest his honorable Lotters shall import, which humblie kissing, on their knees, they deliuered into her Princely hands, who returned many thanks to their King for his loue, with like to them, which had vouchsafed that trauaile (to see her Court and Presence) beseeching them to take in worth a Maidens entertainment in dooing which she should thinke her selfe much beholding vnto them. With pleasant parley, and discoursing of sundrie matters and questions by the Queene propounded, touching their Countreyes, they passed their time vntill Dinner, not without great admiration of the strangers, which beheld her statelie Grace, her sumptuous attire, the duty and honour done by her Nobles and Ladies, which with their costly Apparell and most rare excellence in beautie, greatly delighted them. The time of dinner drawing neere, the tables couered, and all things prepared for the same, the Queen taking her place, the Embassadors wer likewise placed at another table in her presence. The maner of her seruice, with ye diuersity of vyads of all sortes was such, as they could hardly belieue, so manie sudry kinds of fowle, fish, & other cheer for the prepared, were to be found in the limites of the earth. Thus with wonderfull delight, cheared still by her Highnes, they passed the time vntill the ende of dinner, neuer forgetting the Maiesty of her Grace, which so honorably bare her as no Prince could in her time compare with her. Dinner ended, the Queene curteously bidding those strangers welcome, she was conducted by her Nobles into a Gallery, which for beautifull shewes, with rare pictures, and deuises of rich price, was so adorned, as the strangers had neuer seene the like. Not long had they passed the time in noting those glorious deuises, but the Courtiers, who had prouided themselues to doe her Highnesse honor, and cause her delight, which had so long time with drawne her selfe from all pleasures: Armed in all parts, with each man his seuerall deuise, they entered the yard, appointed of custome for the Tilt, where a window opening from the Gallerie, the Queene with the straungers were set to behold these pastimes. The whole company come, each one for honor of her Grace, deliuered his Scuchion of deuise, vnto her Princely hands. Where Gentils suppose you, that know Ladies praises, or dispraises, what happened. Where to beguile the time, was each deuise by the Queene and her Ladies, surueyed with such vigilnet eyes, as nothing was vnremembred, euery one giuing their iudgement, according to that affection they bare the presenter. While they were thus discanting, and the Marshall with the Iudges, appointing each man in his degree to trye himselfe: Behold, a pretty Page, mounted on a light running Courser, with his guid before him, winding his horne in poasting manner, coining neare the place where the Queene was, allighted from his horse, and being not of heigth answerable, to deliuer his Letters with his hand, putting them on his wande (after his dutie done) humbly kissing them, he deliuered them vnto her Maiesties hand, which the Queene perusing, questioned the Page if he had ought else to impart? Who answered, Most famous Princesse, my Lord & master hearing of this assemblie which Fame hath bruted, to the honour of this Royall companie, and high commendations of these Nobles, hath sent (as not daring to approach the place without their lawfull fauour obtained) who for honor of his Mistresse, which he affirmeth (and will maintaine) to be the most exquisite Ladie for all perfections in the confines of the earth: he offereth at the Tilt, with each gain-sayer, to breake sixe staues. If there be any such that will accept his challenge in maintaining his mistrisse-honour, let me know him, who shall soone be answered. The Page being vnknowne, the Nobles wondered what he might be, which without exception had made this challenge, imagining that he was some man of valor, and that it were discurtesie to denie a man at Arms whatsoeuer. Thereon generally concluding, they returned him by the Page, this answere. Page, though thy Masters peremptorie chalenge, deserue rather to be maligned then accepted, yet such is the Nobilitie of Thrace , as honoring Armes, and all professors thereof, accept the same, & where we had appointed euery one his companion, we are content to remit that election, and to bend all our force to his dishonor, and so to him vnknowne, commend vs, whom we intreat to Arme suddenly, & speede him hither. The Page receiuing this answere of the Nobles, the Queene calling him, which mounted, was ready to depart, said. Syr Boy, to thy vnknown Knight commend vs, whom we thanke for vouchsafing vs that honour his Letters import, which our Nobilitie haue (wtout any sute of mine accepted) of whom he shal find men endowed with courage. The page departed sundry were the imaginatios what the Knight might be, who had offered them this proud chalege, in midst wherof a trumpet sounding, they expected the Chalenger, who entred armed in all parts, with blacke armor, which was garnisht with many wouded harts, on ye brest, a Lady with a cloth of fine lawne wipping the, ouer-spreading as many as she could reach with a scarfe, carnatio coloured his word (in Greeke , dispaine not) pacing on with easie paces, according to ye vse of ye place, coming neare that end of the Tilt, which was opposite with the Queenes window, valyng his head to her Maiestie, shee graciouslie badde him welcome, shaking her hand. Long had he not fraide, but the Lord Marshall in like manner, with show of great curtesie had him welcome, and desired him to prepare himselfe, for the defendants attended him. My Lord (quoth the Knight) at their good pleasures, when they shall put themselues forward at the Trumpets sound I will meete them. Thus warning giuen them, without longer stay, the Lord Vrelia , his Copartner in Thessalie , set forward, whom the Mayden Knight met with such force, as his foote were too bigge for his stirrops, and he likely to haue taken a more disgrace being vnhorsed. This first encounter was noted of all the Nobles, who commended his strength regarded him nothing, but with such valor met him, that he made him to his great disgrace, forsake the saddle, at which a generall showt (to the Knights great commendations was giuen. The Lord Vrelia (hauing had his part) another came in place, who went not away without some disgrace, so generally behaued he himselfe, and with such honor & valor bare him, that the Iudges, fathers of Armes, gaue the honor of the day to him, whom they all (though a stranger) highlie comended, The Knight comming before the Queene, humblie dooing his dutie, was with his Trumpet sounding readie to depart, whom the Nobles would not suffer, without his knowledge beseeching him, not so much to dishonor them, of whome hee had deserued honor, in such manner to leaue them. The Mayden Knight who would as willingly haue reuealed himselfe, as they desired, though he made shew of some discontent, yet would not denie their request, but calling for his Armourer, opened his Beauer, who being knowne to be the Mayden Knight they were all ye more honored, taking no disgrace as be foyled of him, by whose handes so many had lost their liues, who were honorable & expert in Arms. Being discouered, he presented himselfe to her Maiesty, who not a little ioyfull of her seruants good fortune whom she graced in this manner. Seruant (qd she) thankes for your paines, and honoring vs at this time, for which I ensure you, I thinke my selfe much beholding, it had beene pitty, truantlike you shuld haue left these honourable Lords your friends, without hauing acknowledged your selfe vnto vs and them, who you shall see will be carefull to procure a Surgion, who doubtles shall cure those bleeding hearts, if any such there be of skil in Thrace . Honored Lady (quoth the Knight) the well-spring of curtesie and Nobility, most humble thanks I yeeld your Maiesty for this grace; without whose fauour and grace, to who in duty I am so bounden, I desire not life. This sayde: the Queene, and the strange Nobles departing, supper being ready, and they set, their table talke was of the braue behauiour of the Knight, who had all the honour attributed him, that was to be required, wherein the strangers were ioyed, louing him dearely, and to increase the Fame, which generally was giuen him, they in presence of the whole assembly declared the honours her Maiesties champion had gained in Thessaly & Egypt , with the death of their King, who of a wound by his hand at Tilt dyed: leauing nothing vnspoken, which might any way honor him: whereof the Queene ioyed not a little, though she concealed the same. Supper being ended, and some part of the night spent in dancing, masking, and other Courtlike pastimes: the Queen comending the nobles to their rests, bad the company good night, who entering her lodging, it might haue ioied the heart of any Lady in loue, to heare the generall laud of the Ladies giuen to the Mayden K. of whom no other talke was to be heard, each honorable part in him comended to his desart, and of his valor in Arms no prayse was sufficient, wherwith the Q. was not a little pleased, nor Guenela discontent, to heare the onely Prize of honour giue her Lord, by whom shee had hope for her passed seruice to be preferred. Thus ioying on all parts, we leaue ye Q. with her company to their rests, and return to the Nobles strangers, whose comendations and honorable reports of the knight was such that nothing could be more pleasing vnto them, applauding the wisdom and noble demeanor of ye Queene, whose like in her time was not as they supposed to be found: with such sundry discourses, passed these Nobles the night, to which we leaue them for a time. The princely pastimes ouerpast, the care of the Queen was for dispatch of the Nobles of Thessalie , whom she was loath to detain from that desire they had to see their Countrey wherfore after some two or three dayes spent in discoursing of their countries, & state of their Realmes, with the commodities thereof, estsoones interlacing their discourses with som pleasant parley wherein the Nobles were much delighted, ye Queen tooke order with her Councel for their answer, limiting a time therefore, to the good content of the strangers: against which prefixed time, the Queene hauing care of her honourable word had her letters all written & signed, when inuiting them to a banquet, she in such honourable manner deliuered their answere, with such words of loue, & desire of good to their King, as ouercome with ioyes thereof, the strangers were not able long time to answere, presenting their King and Queene with gifts of high esteeme, and highly rewarding their honourable paines, which they gratefully accepted, taking order for Gallyes with victuals, and other necessaries to be purueyed with speed and bounty. This honourable entertainement of the Queene to those strangers, being in the prime of her gouernement, gained her such honor through their reports, that those which heard the same, admired her, whom they imagined was peerelesse, for wisedome, bounty, and curtesie, not omitting the fauour & loue of the Nobility, of whose worthinesse they could neuer speake sufficient. How the Nobles of Thessaly hauing receiued great fauors and graces from the Queene and her Nobility, departed The Queene summoned a Parliament, in which the state doth consent that she marry the Maiden knight, and is crowned King and Queene of Thrace and Numedia. As time finisheth the greatest affayres, so the careful trauell of those to whom the prouision of the Fleete was committed was such, that there was no wants in short time vnfurnished, that lacking nothing but a fayre winde, which hee that commaundeth winde and seas, sent in such happy time, as they could wish, which not willing to loose, they commend the health and happy gouernement of the Queene, to him that ruleth all. And so accompanied with the Mayden Knight , who was loath to leaue them, and manie other Pheeres of the land, they were conducted each one to his seuerall Galley where being imbarked, theyr Sayles cut, and they affoore the wind, they gaue their farewell with such a braue ringing peale of great Ordinance, and then likewise their small Artillery, as wonderfully reioyced the beholders, which by the Gunners fro the Queens Forts a shore, was as worthily answered. Thus parted these nobles, who in short time arriued in safety in Egypt , with their King, vnto whom, hauing deliuered the Princes presents with their letters, they omitted no reports of their honourable entertainement of the Queene and her Nobles, in such maner that where they or any of their train long time after became their table talke, was onely of their honourable welcomes in Thrace , euer applauding the magnificent grace, wisedome, and bounty of the Queene, wham they gaue the Prize vnto of all that liued in her time, leauing nothing vnremembred, which might any way empayre the honorable reputation of her Nobles, which vsed them with all the curtesie and bounty becomming their estates: but especially the Maiden knight the discourse of whose valour and manner of behauior, bred more delight then the rest, for that the Nobles & Commons had knowledge of their valour and worthinesse. These honourable commendations of the Nobles ioyed the King, who in his secret thoughts applauded her Highnes fauour and curtesie, that for his sake and honour, had vsed those his subiects in all Princely maner. But amongst those which tooke pleasure in hearing their discourses of the Nobles, the Queene enflamed with their reports, burned with desire to see this peerlesse Princesse, as the second part of this history shall shew you. Till when, leauing the King with his Pheeres to their solace: returne we to Thrace . Where the Knight imboldened by the fauor of his gracious Lady, was not so great a stranger with her highnes, but that he might at pleasure repayre to her presece, with whom by his earnest sute, and desire to be possessed of her whom hee so much loued and honoured, he egged her on still to marry, which for shee would not doe without a generall consent of her Nobles and states of the Realme, shee caused a Parliament to bee summoned, at which time, finding her fit opportunity, shee emparted her determinations, in this maner. Honorable Lords, and you our louing Commons heere assembled, let not these few words I haue to say vnto you, breed any discontent, that will deliuer nothing dishonourable to my State, and your disparagement, to withhold you from the same long, were more nicenesse then wisedom, wherfore briefly thus. Sithence I was by permission of him that exalteth and pulleth downe Princes, at his will, I am by your honourable and generall consents crowned Queene of this Realme, to whose gouernment you haue as lawfully descended from him whom you all loued and feared, committed your selues, sithence which, you haue all with shewes of honourable loue and care of our state and Realmes by sundry examples perswaded me to marriage, which you say, may breed your happines, whose good he that searcheth my harts secrets, knoweth that I more preferre then my life, on whose sutes so ofte made, I haue aduisedly considered, and noting the many perils incident to our sexe, which rather require to bee gouerned, then to gouerne, the name of King being feared, honoured and loued, through which feare, when they hold our sex in contempt. All which with your former sutes: if I graunt to your request, I doubt not, but I shall finde that fauour, which the poorest of my Subiectes haue: freely to choose, where their loues and likings leadeth them, which if you grant, I shall holde my loue well bestowed on you, and shall haue cause to thinke your request in times past hath been honourable, and not to tye me to any inconuenience, assuring you, that what euer he be that I shall bend my liking vnto, shal not disparage my estate, nor dishonour you, but be worthy for wisedome, valour, and what else is required in honourable persons, to mate the Princesse of most renown on the earth. You haue heard what I haue to say and wherfore chiefly this Parliament was summoned, of which I craue your answeres. The Nobles and Lords, both spirituall and temporall, with the Commons of both houses, hearing the Queenes motion, were all mute, not knowing suddenly in a matter of such waight what to answer. But remoued fro their dumps, the Speaker being both wise and well demeaned, as befitted his place, humbly prostrating himselfe thus sayd. Most gracious Princesse, albeit your Maiesties request to this honourable house, is no more then we haue earnestly sought, yet pardon our suddaine answere, and giue vs respite of time vntill to morrow, the remaine of this day, so it stand with your Princely fauour shall be spent to heare the censure of all Estates in these presence, whose loue and duty is such as they will deny nothing, whereon your royall and honourable estate is not disparaged, but in all things, will with all humblenesse subiect themselues to your Highnes pleasure. The Queene loath to require such haste in aunswering her question graciously commaunded him to rise, graunting most willingly to his demaunds, for which the whole assembly with an vniall voyce, gaue her Grace most humble thanks. The Queene hauing deliuered the summe of her desire, graciously commending them to his will that frameth all things, accompanied with many of Pheeres, departeth. The Queen departed, all matters in questions laid apart the Pheeres and most chiefest of both houses assembled theselues in Councel, where you must suppose, no matter for benefite of the State was omitted. The request made by their Queene with great aduise considered, which amongst them was admired, where many imaginations assayled the, deuising of each side, what he should bee that is in so high esteeme and fauour with her Grace, and of such worthy reputation as she hath reported him, eftsoones naming one, then some other, yet the principall obiect of her loue neuer remembred, which draue them all to an non plus . But what euer he were, time of their owne desire to answere, craued some dispatch of what they had in question. Wherfore leauing friuolous questions, they proceed to their begunne action, gladly would they haue been certified of their elected King, but in vaine it was for them to require it, wherfore considering their own desires, they thought it would be taken in euill part of her Highnes, to gaine say what with such humble and earnest sutes they had required, assuring themselues of her wisedome gouernment, and care of their goods, which was so wise, and euery way so honourably demeaned, which considered, thereupon relying, it was generally determined, to referre all to her owne will, pleasure and good liking. On which resolued, the chiefest of the Nobility, accompanied with diuers of the Cleargy, in hope of the Queenes good acceptance, speedeth them to the Court, who suddenly was aduertised of their being, with their request, which was to haue accesse to her Highnesse. No sooner was her Highnesse therof certified, but leauing her chamber where she was busily imploied about those businesses which she had in hand, deuising of the answere of the Commons, leauing all, shee speedeth her vnto them, where taking her place, their duties in all humblenesse done, and shee with all honourable curtesie requited it, the Speaker in presence of the whole assembly, thus sayd. Dread Soueraigne, the Lords both spirituall and temporall, with commons in this honourable Parliament assembled, weying with care and wisedome, the honour of your highnesse, and carefully tendring the weale publike, haue with great care of both (the premises) considered with your Maiesties request, albeit they haue no knowledge of his honourable person, vnto whom your royall liking is vnited, yet relying on your Princely wisedome, and care of your subiects, by whose welfare their happinesse is to be maintained, with one vniall consent, they willingly subiect them selues vnto your Highnesse will and pleasure, assuring your Grace, that whome you shall vouchsafe to endue with title of Lord and husband, they will accept for their Soueraigne, and will in all humblenesse acknowledge with louing hearts their duties vnto him, and to their lawfull King by your Maiesties Election. Thus my gracious Lady, haue they willed me to say, in behalfe of them all, and most humbly beseech your Highnesse, to make knowne vnto them the name so honoured, which you haue vouchsafed to like, to the end they nelgect not that dutie which is due vnto him by your good grace. The Queene hearing this answere of her Commons, was more ioyed, and in heart contented, then euer shee was since the death of her father, her louing countenance shewing content of her heart, so long discontent, which made her with most louely grace and curtesie to say, My Lords all, and you of the Communalty, you haue in yeelding to these honourable motions by me made, highlie contented her, whose desire in loue, made mee not so headstrong to consent without your generall liking, my choyce being such as may bee mated with the oneliest Lady of highest esteeme in the world, as I doubt not your selues will confesse, when he shall be knowne vnto you, my high esteem of him layde apart, for that you may say, affection is blinde. And as the Prouerbe saith, The Negro by nature, blacke and loathsome in our eyes, esteemes her Infant fayre, so Loue which commaundeth all creatures, caused many princes and Ladies of worth, to submit themselues to base Estates. Imperious loue so ouermastering their hearts, to assure you that my liking is not such, and to satisfie you, which with your courteous consent hath contented mee! Know your so elected Soueraigne, and he that I haue subiected my loue vnto, is of no lesse worth then a Prince, royally borne, and descended from the loynes of a King famous, and a Queene endowed with much honour, himselfe shewing his royall descent by his misdemeanour, which is valiant, wise and courteous, such a one, I know your desires is to chuse for your Soueraigne: all affection set apart, such a one haue I chosen, which shall cause all your ioyes, if you ioye in my good: where breaking off your speech, with other wordes of curtesie, yeelding them great thankes, she called Guenela whom she commaunded, to send some trustie messenger for the Prince, willing him, all businesse set apart, to repaire vnto her, which done, framing pleasant discourses, which delighted the Nobles, she sought to their contents, to beguile the time vntill the messenger returned, which made such hast that hee found the Knight, vnto whom hee imparted the Queenes pleasure, which albeit, the suddennesse thereof was troublesome vnto him, cloying his heade, deuising of sundry matters, which her hastie sending for him, should import, yet neglecting no time, he speedeth him to the Presence, where to the Queen he was the welcommest man liuing, as her countenance declared, who calling him vnto her, commanded a chayre to be brought, and seated him on her left hand, to the admiration of al the beholders, which done, she sayd, My Lords, and you our louing Subiects, muse not at this vnwonted fauour vsed to this Gentleman, nor repine not for that it is your owne sute, and my choyce, and hee that I haue sworne my loue and loyall affection vnto, who albeit hath thus long subiected himselfe to our seruice, doing vs many high fauours, as your owne eyes can witnesse, endured vnto it by that high Commaunder of men, who hath procured manie Princes to the like: for our loue, as I am assured, hee abandoned his Kingly seate, disguised in the base attire of a Merchant, came to our Court, where what honors hee hath gained by his valour and curtesie, not one of you but know Numedia being his natiue soyle, and the Kingdome by his lawfull descent from the King his Father. Let it not dismay you my friends, nor iudge my wordes spoken of him for his honour, to be more then truth, so shall you wrog him, whose worth you may by my reports be assured of, and iniurie her which had neuer intent, but to deserue well of you all. Therefore as you haue your desire knowing him, in token of your loue and generall consents, by whome he is your adopted King, shew by your signes of content, how pleasing my choice and liking is vnto you. The Nobles amazed at the Queenes speech, although they could hardly bee induced to beleeue what she had sayde, yet such was the loue they honoured her with, that giuing credit vnto her words, without longer pause of the matter, that the Queene might the rather bee wonne to credit theyr former speech, with an vniuersall voyce, prostrating them selues before him, they cryed, God saue the King and Queen, vowing vnto him loyalty and fealty, as vnto their King and Soueraigne. Thankes good my Lord, quoth the Prince, for your good consents, and doubt not of my loue to you, which with such hearty affection shall be shewed, that my dearest bloud shall bee shed, ere the least hayre of the basest of your heads shall perish. Which sayd, the Queene standing vp, requested, the Nobles, that as they had with consent elected him their king so they would appoint the time for solemnizing the marriage with the Coronation, changing his name from Pheander , the Mayden Knight , to Dionicius , the lawfull heyre of the Numedian Crowne, for that was his right, and the name of Pheander but vsurped. Which request of her Maiestie they easily graunted, appointing the marriage three dayes following, and the Coronation presently to follow, which to their great ioyes was accomplished, with all the honour might be done by their subiects, the costly shewes, and all manner of delightfull pastimes there vsed, I omit, albeit it was pleasing both to their King and Queene, and brought great ioy and comfort to all beholders. The marriage with the Coronation past, the Commons delighted with their King, assured his Grace to bee so honourable as the Queene had reported him, and they found, Who in that Parliament to honour the Thracians the more, and to let them know, his loue was no whitte inferiour to theirs, he entayled the Crowne of Numedia to the lawfull heyres of Thrace succeeding, assuring them, that his Nobles and Commons, should confirme and assure the same, Which courteous fauour, the Peeres and Nobles so gratefully accepted, as they returned him for the same manie gracious thankes: the Parliament proroged, according to the Custome of the Countrie, their duties in all humblenes done, the Nobles with the chiefest of all parts in the Land, wished the King and Queene many happy dayes, to their ioye and heartes content: which they required with such shewes of loue, as might delight them, and giue them cause to ioy in their Princes election, of whom their comfort was great, and their assurance of tranquility with forrain Princes, through his magnanimity to bee such, as all true Subiects might haue pleasure to recount. Their leaue taken, euery one departs, well content to his owne home. How the aged Barnardine, that Pilgrime-like hath trauelled many Countries, in search of the Prince Dionicius, arriued in the Court of Thrace: whome the King questioned of his Countrey and trauell; And in the end is knowne to bee his Tutor Bernardine, who doeth recount vnto him all the troubles of his Countrey of Numedia. His gracious welcome to the Queene, and of the dispatching Ambassadours into the Kindome of Numedia. Thus the King and Queene enioying their heartes content, their loues more and more increased, that there was no talke but onely of their most faithfull loue, and harts liking: through which, the Commons liued in peace, and tranquilitie, praying for their long liues to bee continued. To which content in loue, the Storie leaueth them, recounting the arriuell of the aged Barnardine in Thrace , who with his long trauell came vnto the Court, where wandring Pilgrime-like, liuing by the deuotion of bountifull people, he spent some time in contemplation, others in viewing the beauty of the Court, and manners of the people, eftsoones commending their Religion, and seruing their Creator: taking much pleasure in discoursing with such Pilgrime- straungers as hee mette, of the diuerse conditions of those Nations, whose Countreyes hee had seene, which beeing many, he affected no Princes Region, as this Countrey of Thrace . This graue and ancient aged Father, ouerworne with griefe and tedious long trauell, was so much altered in his face, as hee that (in former time) had well knowne him, might very well now haue mistaken his feature: which made the King, (who oftentimes had noted his comely person) his Pilgrimes attire, and other ornaments, to religion belonging, greatly to affect him, little suspecting it was the aged Bernardine . But as time reuealeth greatest secrets, and bringeth friends to knowledge, so the King taking pleasure, beholding this Pilgrime, noted him so often, that his Physiognomie to his memory, presented the feature of his beloued Bernardine , which imagined thought, beganne to take such roote in the King, as hee greatly desired to haue some conference with the Pilgrime, euermore perswading himself, that it was his Noble Tutor, and carefull Phisition. To assure himselfe, and the better to be resolued of that doubt, hee determined to haue some certaine knowledge of the aged man if hee might, and for that intent, caused his Pages to giue diligent heede, if they saw him in the Courte, to bring him tidings thereof, which they did according to his Maiesties commaunding, attending with such care, at that vsuall time he was accustomed to come, that he passed not of them vnperceyued, whereof they gaue the King intelligence, by whose commaund he was summoned to his Presence. The aged Pilgrime at his first summons of the Messenger, was in such dread of wrong to bee offered him, as he greatlie feared some ill to betide him, well knowing that Princes haue many eyes, and strangers are markes, how poore so euer their Estates are, specially frequenting the Court as he did, yet hee whose conscience could not accuse him of any euil intent against the King, had this hope, that God whom hee serued, doth protect the Innocent, and wold deliuer him. Thus casting his care on him that commaundeth Kings not without many imaginations, what should bee the cause hee came vnto the Kings Presence, vnto whom, as one that knew his good, he prostrated himselfe, praylng most hartilie for the Kings prosperity. The King which saw the olde man bowing before him, kindly tooke him from the ground, tendring his age, which he honoured, whom the more hee noted, the more the louelie face of his beloued Barnardine , presents it vnto his memory, the thought of whom, caused his heart to much sorrow, yet shaking off the griefe, of father, kingdome and friend, he said: Aged Father, in whose face appeareth grauitie, tell mee, of that dutifull loue thou owest thy most beloued friend, of what Countrey thou art? and what Fortunes hath brought thee to this Region? that honouring thee, whose age requireth the same, I may further thy sutes, if thou haue any, or wanting wealth, I may releeue thee. The wofull Pilgrime reuiued by those honourable speeches of the king, sayd: Renowmed Prince, the mirror of honour, of whose fame the world is filled, to satisfie your Excellence know, that occasions of importance thereunto mouing mee: I forsooke my natiue Countrey, in search of those whom my Fortune was neuer yet to meet, yet haue I trauelled many kingdoms and in my trauell haue seene many Princes Courts, and noted their seuerall demeanors, yet most gracious Soueraigne neuer tooke I pleasure in any as in this Countrey of Thrace the Nobles especially giuing me cause to aduice them, whose minds shew their true Gentility, as the fruit maketh the tree knowne: in which taking delight, I haue, though more then becommeth a stranger, so often frequented thy Court, wherewith, if your Grace take any offence, I humbly beseech your pardon, which am now ready to depart. The king, which had heard that tongue so often reade him many Lectures, and giuen him instructions of honour, was not deceiued in him, albeit hee forbeare to acknowledge him whom he desired so heartily to see, vnto whom he was more welcome then any man liuing, yet concealing himselfe, hee sayd: Father, thankes for thy loue, and honourable report of our Realme and people, for which I rest thy debtor. But say mee aged man, of what Countrey art thou, and what account were those friendes with thee, whom thou with such ouer-weary trauell hast sought, whether thy Allies or friends by adoption. At this motion of the King, the olde man ouercome with the thoughts of those, of whome his pittifull tale was to bee tolde, could not forbeare teares, which with such aboundance of bitter sobs and heauy sighes were vttered, insomuch that it moued the King to great ruth, seeing those siluer hayres which he honoured (bedewed with salt drops, the outward witnesse of his inward discontent. Wherefore like the carefull Physition, hauing ministred bitter to his Patient, seasoneth the same with some sweeter taste, hee comforteth the aged Bernardine , with wordes so pleasing, that it cheared the old man, yet would not pardon his report which caused him say, Famous King, if pitty of my olde age may way mooue you, vrge not my faltering tongue to vtter a tale of such ruth as it mporteth: the remembrance whereof ouercloyeth mee with extreame sorrow, and will bring your Excellence but small delight. Therefore Soueraigne Prince, pardon mee, which cannot reueale the truth of so pittifull a tale, (as yet) without the hazard of my life, my heart so ouercharged with griefe, that to thinke thereon, halleth me neare to death, then pardon me. But how loath soeuer, the King might not bee intreated, whom with such pleasing speech hee halleth on, that comforted by his Maiesties kinde wordes, whom hee would not gaine-say, he sayde, sithence nothing may perswade your Excellence to pitty me, accept in worth my rudenesse, and pardon it, Which sayde, humblie doing his duty, as one that could his good, he thus proceeded. Dread Lord, know Numedia is my natiue soyle, where though the grace of my thrice noble Prince, I consumed my youth in all happinesse, fauoured by his fauour, with the best of account in that Region, and so graced by the king that hee committed the gouernement of his deare Sonne, more deare to him then his life, to bee trayned vp by mee, of whome, as dutie willed mee, I had that care as is required of a Subiect vnto his Lord, ioying in nothing the world possesseth, so much as in the towardnes of the Prince, whose whose vertuous youth, might bee a load-starre to all that euer I saw, for curtesie matchlesse, bountifull as Tymon , more valiant then Hector , or the best deseruing that liued, cunning was hee in the liberall Arts, what should I say of him whose honourable prayse, no tongue can with such commendations vtter, as his honours and vertues requireth: so generally beloued of all men, that death is more sweeter to many thousands of his Subiectes, then the remebrance of that noble Prince. Here teares restrained his speech, that he could not vtter a word, standing so astonied, that hee rather represented the Image of death, then a liuing Creature: whome the King put from his heauy passion, thus: Father, thou hast filled my heart with a World of wonders, at thy straunge talke: which I coniure thee, of that loue thou owest the Prince whome thou sorrowest so to remember, not to leiue in such abrupt maner, but proceede: dyed the King and the Prince, so of thee honoured, & thorough their deaths gan thy trauell. Say sweet Father. Though the reporting of this dolefull history, more grieuous vnto me then death, should finish my dayes, yet such is the pennance by your Maiesties coniuring speech enioyned mee, that what griefe soeuer I endure, I will satisfie your Grace. The Prince, oh my Lord, that it would please you to pardon the rest, growing to yeares of discretion, I know not through what meanes, neyther could I for all the diligence I vsed, attaine vnto it, but sicke hee was, & so opprest with such a strange agonie, that no Phisicke could minister reliefe vnto him, nor yeeld him any ease, so that there was small hope of his recouery, the strangenesse of each maladie being such, as sometime faring like a man franticke, no perswasions of reason might preuayle with him, who in his health was to be ruled in all things. This passion so long assayled the Prince, and so little hope of his recouerie, that the extremity thereof gan touch the King and Queene mother, whose carefull loue was such, as nature could not require more in Parents whatsoeuer. The continuall griefe of the Prince, wrought such care in the aged King & Queene that it was not to be found which of them was most grieued or whose lotte it was to giue his due to death first: yet as no care is so great but hath some comfort: so the the commaunder of men, when all hope of life was past hope of men restored the Prince to health, and by his health, recouered the King & Queen, for whose weale, the Comons more reioyced, then of their owne good, so that a generall ioy was throughout the realme, triumphing at this happy recouery of the Prince, the King and Queene. But as the fayrest day is ouershadowed with cloudes, so was the sunshine of their ioy eclipsed, through the great folly of the Prince, who vnknowne of all men, or acquainting any with his pretence left his Father, Crowne and Subiects, and liueth no man knoweth how, or where, for whome the King felt a milion of woes: griefe so assayling his aged Corpes, as hee was like to rest with death, but reason subduing affection, here-couered his sicknesse, and leauing his land without a Gouernor, likewise departed, whether no man knoweth. The mother Queene being of nature but weake, resigned her due to death, whome as duty commaunded me, I entombed with such honour as beseemed the person of a Queene, and so perswaded with the Commons in a Parliament, for the same entent called, as the gouernement of the Realme was committed to sixe of the Nobility, who are bound to resigne their authoritie, when the lawfull Successor shall require it. Which done, I forsooke all I enioyed, and Pilgrime-like (as your Highnesse sees) haue trauelled many Countries and Kingdomes in search of my Soueraign the prince, but for all the diligence I can vse, of them can heare no tidings. Thus with teares standing in his eyes, hee ended his lamentable historie, which the King was assured to bee true, but least was the thought of Bernardine , that hee deliuered this dolefull tale to the Prince, which had likewise some cause of griefe, which so neare touched himselfe, as he could not for teares vtter what hee would, yet putting by his passions as he could, he sayd: Aged father, matter of great ruth hast thou deliuered, which to heare is most lamentable, and may touch that carelesse Prince neare, by whome this chance is chaunced, his Parents and Subiects: But tell mee Father, all griefe laide apart, in what state liueth the Subiectes of thy king vnder their gouernement which the charge. Yet is not your Grace satisfied (quoth the Pilgrime) but will exact on mee more to encrease my griefe? which seeing you delight in, I shall vnfolde that which in recounting will finish all, yeelding my breath to him that gaue it mee, therefore attend. Not long sithence, vnknowne, I chanced to accompany in my trauell, a Gentleman of Numedia , to mee well knowne, which for I sawe I was out of knowledge with him, I questioned him of many matters, as your Grace hath done me, which amongst other his newes of discontent, reported that those elected gouernors, whose heartes broyling with ambition, and desire of the whole authoritie, as the title of King, to the ambitious is sweet, so these couetous wretches, taking part one with the other, some enclining one way, some to the other part, that ciuill discention was raysed, where the Father beare arms against the sonne, the sonne against the father, and Kinsman against kinsman, one imbruing their hands in others blood, through which, many a woman is lost a widdow, and many a sweete Infant fatherlesse, which makes me greatly feare, without his helpe, that sendeth a helpe to the helpelesse, the land will bee impouerished, and our King and Prince returning, shall from their proper right bee debarred, by these vsurping villaines, whose hearts my aged teeth in reuenge of their trechery, and wrong done the Commons, I could teare. The Prince hearing this tale of discontent, was mooued more at the wrong offered the Commons, then all the former history, which made him say: Father, I haue noted thy long tale, which hath mooued me both to sorrow and delight, grieuing for the Commons opprest, yet ioying that any Prince should haue a subiect of such worth, as is rare in those times to bee found, wherefore father, that thou mayest liue in my Court, to draw others to their fidelity to their Prince, I will here detayne thee, and for thou louest that carelesse Prince Dionisius , will honour thee during my life, enduing thee with treasure, and what else thou shalt at any time commaund, for all I enioy is thine, and if hereafter thou shalt thinke it conuenient, I will with a strong power, enter their distressed Confines, and chastning those Rebels, leaue thee regent in their place, vntill further tidings shall bee of thy King or his soune, whome I am sure will not abuse them. The aged Father, hearing those honorable speeches fro the mouth of the King was astonied, knowing well that Princes of esteeme honour themselues, holding their words, yet not minded to giue ouer search for his soueraigne, he returned the King humble thankes, beseeching his Highnesse to pardon him, which hath vowed to end his life in performing his vowe to the Prince, and eyther heare tidinges of him, or neuer see his Countrey, the place of the world most pleasing vnto him. The King hearing his wordes, hauing great experience of his fidelity, could conceale himselfe no longer, but imbracing him in his armes, bedewing his aged hayres with drops like raine, he sayd: Faithfull Barnardine , the mirror of true friendship, whose equall in loue is not to be found, what cause haue I to honor thee, whose care is such of me, that haue so ill deserued, but forgiue mee Barnardine , my misse against thee committed, forgiue mee Noble Father, and you Subiects of Numedia , who by me vnhappy Creature, haue bin so much wronged, and thou Barnardine , my carefull Tutor, forgiue mee I entreate, and continue thy loue vnto mee vnhappy Prince, whome thou hast now founde; which for thy fidelity hath vowed to honour thee, as hereafter my deedes shal manifest. Wherefore, after thy weary trauell, rest thee with mee in Thrace , where thou shall bee a second Dionicius , for neuer will I liue longer, then to bee held a friend and perfect louer of thee, which with such carefull trauell, truth and loyaltie, hath shewed thy selfe so firme a friend. Barnardine as a man whose sences were bereaued, standing long time staring the King in the face, as a man rauished, beholding with good aduise his Phisiognimy, when through his long viewe, by a secret signe hee had knowledge of his Soueraigne, such suddaine ioy assayled him, that ouercome with the same, he fell in a traunce, to the great discomfort of the King, who shewed his skill to reuiue him, with shaking and rubbing his pulses, sparing no paines vntill hee had brought him to breath, who being recouered, turning his eyes as a man distraught, after hee had paused a while, sayd, Worthy Prince, how blessed am I of the Gods, that haue graunted me such grace to beholde my Soueraigne, the chiefe ioy of my worldly ioyes, which hauing seene, I care not how soone the sommons of death attache me, my request being obtayned, which long time haue cloyed theyr Deities with my tedious Orisons, for thy weale, which seeing, by their permission I haue obtayned, Let it not bee offensiue vnto your Maiestie, to resolue me, what mooued you to leaue your Noble Father, and those your subiects that honoured you, vnto whom your Excellence was more deare then life. Uncurteous, (my louing Barnardine ) might I be helde and accounted amongst men most vngratefull, if I should denie thy request, who hath shewed thy selfe so firme a friend vnto mee, therefore attend, what grieuous malladies opprest me, My good friend quoth the King, is known to none so well as your selfe, whose paines for my recouerie was such, as I shall neuer requite, the cause I haue hearde thee, and many learned of our Countrey affirme, they could neuer attaine to know, though for my recouerie all meanes was by them and you sought, which made my griefe the more to encrease. The originall proceeding from a conceited fancie, Loue maistering my heart, which with such power commanded all my inferiour parts, as I expected no other but death, which I rather would haue subiected my selfe vnto, then haue reuealed the same. But hee that gouerneth mens thoughts, on the suddaine as you can witnesse, when al hope was past, armed me with courage, whereon I took such hold resoluing to follow my determinations, that with thought thereof, I recouered in short time my health, which obtained, disguised in the attire of a Merchant, hauing purueyed me sufficient store of Coyne and Iewels, I imbarked my selfe for this Port, where without carrying other shewe, I imployed by Brokers my stocke, to maintain my charge, till opportunity was offered mee, in defence of the King here, and his daughter my Queene, to shew my force against the Turke his inuading foe, wherein I obtayned a happy victory, and by that victory, obtayning some better reputation, the King holding me right deare, where, by the hand of the Princesse I receyued my Knighthoode, a gift so pleasing to me, in the worlds regiment was not to be found, esteeming more the honour done me by my sweet Mistresse, the commaunder of my heart, then all the kingdoms of the earth, for by her loue I liued, without whose fauour, I had long sithence rested with the dead: shee my Barnardine , which vntill my comming into her Countrey I neuer saw, but onely by report of her vertuous and honourable demeanors, whereof no man could say sufficient, so enthralled my heart, that nothing but her loue might preserue my life, so had her vertues lincked mee in loue vnto her, whose loue, it hath pleased the heauenly powers to bestowe vpon mee, whereof being possest, no man hath more cause to glorifie their Deities. Thus my Barnadine , haue I acquainted thee with my cares, neuer before to any known: Loue of this Lady, was the Loadstar that brought me hither, through whose loue, I possesse the Crowne of Thrace and kingdome, whether no man so welcome as my Barnardine , and so vse me sweete friend, quoth the King, as if I were Barnardine , for next my Lady and Queene, thou possest the entire affection of my heart. The Queene which expected her Lords company for dinner, musing at his long stay, hauing no more company in his study but the Pilgrime, went her selfe to call him, and to breake their parley, thus pleasantly shee saide: My Lord, quoth the Queene, are your offences so great, and your sins so many, that they require such long time for absolution, in my opinion your highnesse were good. If you haue not finished, to take some Uyands, and then begin againe, for I ensure you, it is dinner time long sithence. Your Grace, quoth the King is pleasantly disposed, I am glad to see you in so good a humour, especially, my friend being in place, which of the Loue you beare me, I intreat to bidde welcome, for he is neare and deare vnto me. The Queene hearing the King, well noting his words, imagined that shee was deluded, and that his reputation was not such as hee had reported himselfe to be, yet that her thoughts might breede no dislike, through her silence, shee curteously raysed the Pilgrime from the ground, giuing her hand to kisse, and with shew of the best content she could, bad him heartily welcome, beseeching the King to let her know what hee was, that shee might doe him that honour as his estate requireth. Thankes Madam (quoth the King) for in honouring him, you shall shew your loue to mee; which haue greate cause to requite him: to satisfie your Grace what hee is being so poore in attire, and so high in esteeme with mee: know Madam, he was sometime of Councell to my Father the King, and my faithfull Physition and Tutor in my minority, whose loyalty and loue hath beene such to me in times past, as since I abandoned my Countrey, hee forsooke not onely his possessions, but his place of honour, & what else hee ioyed most in, committing his aged corps to trauell, and many Princes Countries hath trauelled in search for mee, of whome hee neuer had hope euer to beeholde againe: leauing my Realme in such wise, as I did them, whereof your Ladiships loue was the cause, though all the Physitions of the Countrey could not by their skill finde it: Therefore Madame, for my sake loue him, and giue him your fauourable countenance, which hee will endeuour to deserue. The Queene put by her imaginations, assured what the King sayde was truth (whom to please) shee entertained so graciously, as if he had been a Prince of great worth, which ioyed the aged man, and highly contented the King, who not willing to detaine their stomackes, which long before was ready for dinner; taking Bernardine by the hande, ledde him to the Presence, where sitting downe to dinner, placed him opposite against him, gracing him with what countenance hee could best frame to content him, wherein the Queene for her part was not behind. Thus passed they Dinner with delight, not without great admiration of the Nobles, who had diuers thoughtes and cogitations in their mindes, what he should be, that was so fauoured. Dinner ended, the King departed to his lodging, where hee tooke order for Barnardines apparrell, such as became a Councellor and a man of his grauitie, passing the day in recounting oft the estate of his owne subiects in Numedia , of whom, for that he would be assured, he presently tooke order for the dispatch of one of the Nobility to his Countrey, to whome hee gaue strict charge, not to bee knowne of his successe, in attayning the Kingdome of Phrace , but according to his Letters, whose contents imported his imprisonment in a forraine Countrey, with commaund, to puruey his ransome, which was a great summe, and with that messenger to repayre vnto him, who liued obscured among his enemies, not daring to be knowne vnto any man, but onely to that honourable Gentleman, whose loue he had found such as hee could not requite, with like request that they entertaine him, in such manner as they would himselfe if he were present. By this policie (the King thought to make tryall of their loues and loyalties) perswading himselfe, that if theyr readines were such, to deliuer so much money as he required, that their loues to him was not alienated, considering what power that trash hath to commaund men: with this charge the Noble Gentleman departed, whome to his Fortunes by Sea wee leaue: Returning to Barnardine , was calling to remembrance the answere of the Oracle, he noted this in the King, who, in recouting his trauels, had taken vpon him the shape of a Merchant: Afterwardes, by the Princesse knighted, and lastly, throughly his good fortunes, crowned King, and possessed, of the Diademe of Thrace : whereby hee was assured, that he was Merchant, King and Knight, which falling out so happily, hee thanked the Gods for their passed comfort, and was more in hope to see the end so successiuely to ensue. Here Gentiles the History leaueth the Messenger bound for Thrace to his carefull Ambassage, the King and Queene in honorable content, consuming their dayes in such pleasing delight, as their Loues might well bee mirrours for all the Court and Commons to follow, which increased their ioies that noted their entire ioyes. Bernardine , hee called to the place of a Councellor, which he discharged with such wisdome and care, that hee gained through curtesie the fauour of the Princesse, and was of the Nobles and Commons in high esteeme. Thus vntill the Messengers returne, wee leaue the King and Queene to their pleasures in loue, the Councell to the care of the common-weale, and the Commons to their Orisons, who dayly praysed the Goddes for their Princes choyce, and with vnfayned meditations, besought them to continue their liues in all happinesse amongst the[illeg.] on whose weale, their goods did wholly depen[illeg.] What ensueth (at the Messengers returne) you shall haue knowledge, so you vouchsafe to entertain this past with curtesie. FINIS.
