 the thirde may come and carie it avvay. And this prouerbe may (as I feare) be wel verefied in me which take in hand the imprinting of this poeticall Poesie. For the case seemeth doubtful, and I vvill disclose my coniecture. Master. H: VV. in the beginning of this worke, hath in his letter (vvritten to the Readers) cunningly discharged himselfe of any such misliking, as the grauer sort of greyheared iudgers mighte (perhaps) conceiue in the publicatio of these pleasant Pamphlets. And nexte vnto that learned preamble, the letter of. G. T. (by vvhome as seemeth, the first coppie hereof vvas vnto the same. H. VV. deliuered, doth with no lesse clerkly cuning seeke to persvvade the readers, that he (also) vvoulde by no meanes haue it published. Novv I feare very muche (all these vvords notvvithstading) that these tvvo gentlemen vvere of one assent compact to haue it imprinted: And yet, finding by experiece that nothing is so vvelhadled novv adayes, but that some malicious minds may either take occasion to mislike it themselues, or else finde meanes to make it odious vnto others: They haue therefore (each of them) politiquely preuented the daunger of misreport, and suffered me the poore Printer to runne avvay vvith the palme of so perillous a victorie. Notwithstanding, hauing vvel perused the vvorke, I find nothing therein amisse (to my iudgemente) vnlesse it be tvvo or three vvanton places passed ouer in the discourse of an amorous enterprise: The vvhich for as much as the vvords are cleanly (although the thing ment be somevvhat naturall) I haue thought good also to let them passe as they came to me, and the rather bicause (as master. H. VV. hath vvell alleadged in his letter to the Reader) the well minded ma may reape some commoditie out of the most friuolous vvorks that are vvritten. And as the venemous spider vvil sucke poison out of the most holesome herbe, and the industrious Bee can gather hony out of the most stinking vveede: Euen so the discrete reader may take a happie exaple by the most lasciuious histories, although the captious and harebraind heads can neither be encoraged by the good, nor forevvarned by the bad. And thus muche I haue thought good to say in excuse of some sauours, which may perchance smell vnpleasantly to some noses, in some part of this poeticall poesie. Novv it hath vvith this fault a greater commoditie than common poesies haue ben accustomed to present, and that is this, you shall not be constreined to smell of the floures therein coteined all at once, neither yet to take them vp in such order as they are sorted: But you may take any one flowre by it selfe, and if that smell not so pleasantly as you vvold wish, I doubt not yet but you may find some other which may supplie the defects thereof. As thus, he vvhich wold haue good morall lessons clerkly handled, let him smell to the Tragedie translated out of Euripides. He that wold laugh at a prety conceit closely conueyed, let him peruse the comedie translated out of Ariosto. He that vvould take example by the vnlavvfull affections of a louer bestovved vppon an vnconstant dame, let them reade the report in verse, made by Dan Bartholmevv of Bathe, or the discourse in prose of the aduentures passed by master F. I. vvhome the reader may name Freeman Iones, for the better vnderstanding of the same: he that vvould see any particuler pang of loue liuely displayed, may here approue euery Pamphlet by the title, and so remaine contented. As also diuers godly himnes and Psalmes may in like manner be founde in this recorde. To conclude, the worke is so vniuersall, as either in one place or other, any mans mind may therevvith be satisfied. The vvhich I aduenture (vnder pretext of this promise) to present vnto all indifferent eyes as follovveth. Folio.

And herewithal my said friend charged me, that I should vse them onely for mine owne particuler commoditie, and eftsones safely deliuer the originall copie to him againe, wherein I must confesse my selfe but halfe a marchant, for the copie vnto him I haue safely redeliuered. But the worke (for I thought it worthy to be publilished) I haue entreated my friend A. B. to emprint: as one that thought better to please a number by common commoditie then to feede the humor of any priuate parson by nedelesse singularitie. This I haue aduentured, for thy contentation (learned Reader.) And further haue presumed of my selfe to christen it by the name of A hundreth sundrie Flowers: In which poeticall posie are set forth manie trifling fantasies, humorall passions, and straunge affects of a Louer. And therin (although the wiser sort wold turne ouer the leafe as a thing altogether fruitlesse) yet I my selfe haue reaped this commoditie, to sit and smile at the fond deuises of such as haue enchayned them selues in the golden fetters of fantasie, and hauing bewrayed themselues to the whole world, do yet coniecture yt they walke vnseene in a net. Some other things you may also finde in this Booke, which are as voyde of vanitie, as the first are lame for gouernement. And I must confesse that (what to laugh at the one,  & what to learne by the other) I haue contrary to the chardge of my said friend G. T. procured for these trifles this day of publication. Wherat if the aucthors onely repyne, and the number of other learned mindes be thankfull: I may then boast to haue gained a bushell of good will, in exchange for one pynt of peeuish choler. But if it fal out contrary to expectatio that the readers iudgements agree not with myne opinion in their commendacions, I may then (vnlesse their curtesies supplie my want of discretion) with losse of some labour, accompt also the losse of my familier friendes, in doubt whereof, I couer all our names, and referre you to the well written letter of my friende G. T. next following, whereby you may more at large consider of these occasions. And so I comend the praise of other mens trauailes together with the pardon of mine owne rashnes, vnto the well willing minds of discrete readers. From my lodging nere the Strande the xx. of Ianuary, 1572. H. W. Remembring the late conference passed betwene vs in my lodging, and how you seemed to esteeme some Pamphlets, which I did there shew vnto you farre aboue their worth in skill, I did straightwaye conclude the same your iudgment to procede of two especiall causes, one (and principall) the stedfast good will, which you haue euer hitherto sithens our first familiaritie borne towardes mee. An other (of no lesse weight) the exceding zeale and fauour that you beare to good letters. The which (I agree with you) do no lesse bloome and appeare in pleasaunt ditties or compendious Sonets, deuised by green youthful capacities, than they do fruitefully florish vnto perfection in the ryper workes of graue and grayheared writers. For as in the last, the yonger sort maye make a mirror of perfecte life: so in the first, the most frosty bearded Philosopher , maye take iust occasion of honest recreation, not altogether without holsome lessons, tending to the reformation of manners. For who doubteth but that Poets in their most feyned fables and imaginations, haue metaphorically set forth vnto vs the right rewardes of vertues, and the due punnishments for vices? Marie in deede I may not compare Pamphlets vnto Poems, neither yet may iustly aduant for our natiue countrimen, that they haue in their verses hitherto (translations excepted) deliuered vnto vs any such notable volume, as haue bene by Poets of antiquitie, left vnto the posteritie. And the more pitie, that amongst so many toward wittes no one hath bene hitherto encouraged to followe the trace of that worthy and famous Knight Sir Geffrey Chaucer , and after many pretie deuises spent in youth, for the obtayning a worthles victorie, might consume and consummate his age in discribing the right pathway to perfect felicitie, with the due preseruation of the same. The which although some may iudge ouer graue a subiect to be handled in stile metrical, yet for that I haue found in the verses of eloquent Latinists, learned Greeks,  & pleasant Jtalians , sundrie directions, whereby a man may be guided toward thattayning of that vnspeakeable treasure, I haue thus farre lamented, that our countreymen, haue chosen rather to winne a passouer praise by the wanton penning of a few louing layes, than to gayne immortall fame, by the Clarkely handlinge of so profitable a Theame. For if quicknes of inuencion, proper vocables, apt Epythetes, and store of monasillables may help a pleasant brayne to be crowned with Lawrell. I doubt not but both our countreymen  & countrie language might be entronised amonge the olde foreleaders vnto the mount Helicon . But nowe let mee returne to my first purpose, for I haue wandred somwhat beside the path, and yet not cleane out of the way. I haue thought good (I say) to present you with this writte booke, wherein you shall find a number of Sonets , layes, letters, Ballades, Rondlets, verlayes and verses, the workes of your friend and myne Master F. I. and diuers others, the which when I had with long trauayle confusedly gathered together, I thought it then Opere precium , to reduce them into some good order. The which I haue done according to my barreyne skill in this written Booke, commending it vnto you to read and to peruse, and desiring you as I onely do aduenture thus to participate the sight therof vnto your former good will, euen so that you will by no meanes make the same common: but after your owne recreation taken therin yt you wil safely redeliuer vnto me the originall copie. For otherwise I shall not onely prouoke all the aucthors to be offended with mee, but further shall leese the opertunitie of a greater matter, halfe and more graunted vnto mee alreadie, by the willing consent of one of them. And to be playne (with you my friend) he hath written (which as farre as I can learne) did neuer yet come to the reading or perusinge of any man but himselfe: two notable workes. The one called, the Sundry lots of loue . The other of his owne inuencion entituled. The clyming of an Eagles neast . These thinges (and especially the later) doth seeme by the name to be a work worthy the reading. And the rather I iudge so because his fantasie is so occupied in the same, as that contrary to his wonted vse, he hath hitherto withhelde it from sight of any his familiers, vntill it be finished, you may gesse him by his Nature . And therfore I requier your secresie herein, least if he hear the contrary, we shall not be able by any meanes to procure these other at his handes. So fare you wel, from my Chamber this tenth of August, 1572. Youres or not his owne. G. T. When I had with no small entreatie obteyned of Master F. J. and sundry other toward young gentlemen, the sundry copies of these sundry matters, then aswell for that the number of them was great, as also for that I found none of them, so barreyne, but that (in my iudgmet) had in it Aliquid Salis , and especially being considered by the very proper occasion whereuppon it was written (as they them selues did alwayes with the verse reherse vnto me the cause yt then moued them to write) I did with more labour gather them into some order, and so placed them in this register. Wherein as neare as I could gesse, I haue set in the first places those which Master F. J. did compyle. And to begin with this his history that ensueth, it was (as he declared vnto me) written vppon this occasio. The said F. J. chaunced once in the north partes of this Realme to fall in company of a very fayre gentlewoman whose name was Mistresse Elinor , vnto whom bearinge a hotte affection, he first aduentured to write this letter following. G. T. parties, my good hap hath bene to behold you to my (no small) contentation, and my euill happ accompanies the same, with such imperfection of my deserts, as that I finde alwayes a readie repulse in mine owne [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD5418&area=prose&forward=textsFT) frowardnes. So that consideringe the naturall clymate of the countrie, I must say that I haue found fire in frost. And yet comparing the inequalitie of my deserts, with the least part of your worthines, I feele a continuall frost, in my most feruent fire. Such is then thextremitie of my passions, the which I could neuer haue bene content to committe vnto this telltale paper, weare it not that I am destitute of all other helpe. Accept therfore I beseeke you, the earnest good will of a more trustie (than worthy) seruaunt, who being therby encouraged, may supplie the defects of his abilitie with readie triall of duetifull loyalty. And let this poore paper (besprent with salt teares, and blowen ouer with skalding sighes) be saued of you as a safe garde for your sampler, or a bottome to wind your sowing silke, that when your last nedelfull is wrought, you maye returne to readinge therof and consider the care of hym who is More youres than his owne. F. I. This letter by hir receiued (as I haue hard him say) hir answere was this: She toke occasion one daye, at his request to daunce with him, the which doinge, she bashfully began to declare vnto him, that she had read ouer the writinge, which he deliuered vnto hir, with like protestation, that (as at deliuerie therof, she vnderstode not for what cause he thrust the same into hir bosome,) so now she coulde not perceyue therby any part of his meaning, neuerthelesse at last semed to take vppon hir the matter, and though she disabled hir selfe, yet gaue him thankes as  &c. Wheruppon he brake the braule, and walkinge abrode deuised immediatly these fewe verses followinge. G. T.  With deawe bedimmd King Dauids eyes that ruled Jsraell, And Salomon him selfe, the source of sapience, Against the force of such assaultes could make but small defece: To it the stoutest yeeld, and strongest feele like woo, Bold Hercules and Sampson both, did proue it to be so. What wonder seemeth then? when starres stand thicke in skies, Jf such a blasing starre haue power to dim my dazled eyes? To you these fewe suffise, your wittes be quicke and good, You can coniect by chaunge of hew, what humors feede my blood.  F. I. I haue heard the Aucthor saye, that these were the first verses that euer he wrote vppon like occasion. The which cosidering ye matter precedent, may in my iudgement be well allowed, and to iudge his doings by the effectes he declared vnto me, that before he coulde put the same in legible writinge, it pleased the sayd Mystresse Elinor of hir curtesie thus to deale with him. Walking in a garden among diuers other gentlemen  & gentlewomen, with a little frowning smyle in passing by him, she deliuered vnto him a paper, with these words. For that I vnderstand not (quoth shee) th'intent of your letters, I pray you take them here againe, and bestow them at your pleasure . The which done and sayde, shee passed by without change either of pace or countenaunce. F. I. somewhat troubled with her angrie looke, did sodenly leaue the companie,  & walking into a parke neare adioyning, in great rage began to wreake his mallice on this poore paper, and the same did rend and teare in peeces. When sodenly at a glaunce he perceaued it was not of his owne hande writing, and therewithall abashed, vppon better regard he perceyued in one peece therof written ( in Romaine ) these letters SHE: wherefore placing all the peeces therof, as orderly as he could, he found therin written, these fewe lynes hereafter followinge. G. T. lacke of chosen copany to return vnto my worke, wherein I did so long continew, till at the last the bare bottome did drawe vnto my remembraunce your straunge request. And although I founde therin no iust cause to credite your coulored woordes, yet haue I thought good hereby to requite you with like curtesie, so that at least you shall not condemne me for vngratefull. But as to the matter therin conteyned, if I could perswade my selfe, that there were in mee any coales to kyndle such sparkes of fire, I might yet peraduenture bee drawen to beleue that your minde were frosen with like feare. But as no smoke ariseth, where no cole is kindled, so without cause of affection the passion is easie to be cured. This is all that I vnderstand of your darke letters. And as much as I meane to aunsweare. SHE. My friend F. J. hath tolde me diuers times, that imediatly vppon receit hereof, he grew in ielosy, that the same was not her owne deuise. And therin I haue no lesse allowed his iudgment, then comended his inuention of the verses, and letters before rehersed. For as by the stile this letter of hirs bewrayeth that it was not penned by a womans capacitie, so the sequell of hir doings may discipher, that she had mo ready clearkes then trustie seruants in store. Well yet as the perfect hound, when he hath chased the hurt deere, amidde the whole heard, wil neuer giue ouer till he haue singled it againe. Euen so F. J. though somewhat abashed with this doubtfull shewe, yet still constant in his former intention, ceased not by all possible meanes, to bringe this Deere yet once agayne to the Bowes, wherby she might be the more surely stryken: and so in the end enforced to yeeld. Wherfore he thought not best to commit the sayde verses willingly into hir custodie, but priuily lost them in hir chamber, written in counterfeit. And after on the next day thought better to replie, either vpon hir, or vppon hir Secretary in this wyse as here followeth. G. T. to replye vnto: neuerthelesse in myne owne defence, thus much I alleage: that if my sodein departure pleased not you, I cannot my selfe therwith be pleased, as one that seeketh not to please many, and more disirous to please you then any. The cause of myne affection, I suppose you behold dayly. For (self loue auoyded) euery wight may iudge of themselues as much as reason perswadeth: the which if it be in your good nature suppressed with bashfulnes, then mighty loue graunt, you may once behold my wan cheekes wasshed in woe, that therein my salt teares may be a myrrour to represent your owne shadow, and that like vnto Narcissus you may bee constrayned to kisse the cold waues, wherein your couterfait is so liuely portrayed. For if aboundance of other matters fayled to drawe my gazing eyes in contemplacion of so rare excellency, yet might these your letters both frame in me an admiration of such diuine esprit, and a confusion to my dull vnderstanding, which so rashly presumed to wander in this endles Laberinthe. Such I esteeme you, and thereby am become such, and Euen HE. F. I. This letter finished and fayre written ouer, his chauce was to meete hir alone in a Gallery of the same house: where (as I haue heard him declare) his manhood in this kind of combat was first tryed, and therein I can compare him to a valiant Prince, who distressed with power of enemies had committed the safegard of his person to treaty of Ambassade, and sodenly (surprised with a Camnassado in his own trenches) was enforced to yeeld as prisoner. Euen so my friend F. J. lately ouercome by ye beautifull beames of this Dame Elynor , and hauing now comitted his most secrete intent to these late rehearsed letters, was at vnwares encountred with his friendly foe, and constrayned either to prepare some new defence, or else like a recreant to yeeld himself as already vaquished. Wherfore (as in a traunce) he lifted vp his dazled eyes,  & so continued in a certen kind of admiration, not vnlike the Astronomer, who (hauing after a whole nights trauayle, in the grey morning found his desired starre) hath fixed his hungry eies to behold the Comete long looked for: wherat this gracious Dame (as one that could discerne ye sun before hir chaber windowes were wide ope) did deign to embolden the feinting Knight wt these or like words. I perceiue now (quod she) how mishap doth follow me, that hauing chosen this walke for a simple solace, I am here disquieted by the man that meaneth my distructio: & therwithal, as half angry, began to turne hir back, when as my friend F. J. now awaked, gan thus salute hir. Mystres (quod he) and I perceiue now, yt good hap hauts me, for being by lack of oportunitie constreined to comit my welfare vnto these blabbing leaues of bewraying paper (shewing yt in his hand) I am here recoforted wt happy view of my desired ioye,  & therewithall reueretly kissing his hand, did softly distreine hir slender arme & so stayed hir departure. The first blow thus profered & defended, they walked & talked trauersing diuers wayes, wherein I doubt not but yt my friend F. J. could quit himself resonably well. And though it stood not with duty of a friend that I should therin require to know his secrets, yet of him self he declared thus much, that after long talke shee was contented to accept his proferd seruice, but yet still disabling hir self, and seeming to maruell what cause had moued him to subiect his libertie so wilfully, or at least in a prison (as she termed it) so vnworthy. Whereunto I neede not rehearse his answere, but suppose now, yt thus they departed: sauing I had forgotten this, shee required of him the last rehearsed letter, saying that his first was lost,  & now she lacked a new bottome for hir silke, the which I warrat you, he grauted: and so profering to take an humble cong e by Bezo las manos , shee graciously gaue him the zuccado dez labros: and so for then departed. And therupo recopting hir words, he copyled these following, which he termed Terza sequenza , to sweet Mystres SHE . G. T.  What reason first persuades the foolish Fly (As soone as shee a candle can discerne) To play with flame, till shee bee burnt thereby? Or what may moue the Mouse to byte the bayte Which strykes the trappe, that stops hir hungry breth? What calles the Byrd, where snares of deepe deceit Are closely [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD5418&area=prose&forward=textsFT) caught to draw hir to hir death? Consider well, what is the cause of this, And though percase thou wilt not so confesse, Yet deepe desire, to gayne a heauenly blisse, May drowne the mynd in dole and darke distresse: Oft is it seene (whereat my hart may bleede) Fooles playe so long till they be caught in deed. And then Jt is a heauen to see them hop and skip, And seeke all shiftes to shake their shackles of: Jt is a world, to see them hang the lip. Who (earst) at loue, were wont to skorne and skof. But as the Mouse, once caught in crafty trap, May bounce and beate, agaynst the boorden wall, Till shee haue brought hir head in such mishape, That doune to death hir fainting lymbes must fall: And as the Flye once singed in the flame, Cannot commaund hir wings to waue away: But by the heele, shee hangeth in the same Till cruell death hir hasty iourney stay. So they that seeke to breake the linkes of loue Stryue with the streame, and this by payne J proue. For when J first beheld that heauenly hewe of thyne, Thy stately stature, and thy comly grace, J must confesse these dazled eyes of myne Did wincke for feare, when J first viewd thy face But bold desire, did open them agayne, And bad mee looke till J had lookt to long, J pitied them that did procure my payne, And lou'd the lookes that wrought me all the wrong: And as the Byrd once caught (but woorks her woe) That stryues to leaue the lymed [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD5418&area=prose&forward=textsFT) winges behind: Euen so the more J straue to parte thee fro, The greater grief did growe within my minde: Remediles then must J yeeld to thee, And craue no more, thy seruaunt but to bee Tyll then and euer. HE. F.I.  When he had wel sorted this sequence, he sought oportunitie to leaue it where she might finde it before it were lost. And now the coles bega to kindle, wherof (but ere whyle) she feigned hir self altogither ignorant. The flames began to break out on euery syde: & she to quench them, shut vp hir self in hir chamber solitarely. But as the smithie gathers greater heat by casting on of water, euen so the more she absented hir self from company, the fresher was the grief which galded hir remembrance: so that at last the report was spred thorough the house, that Mystres Elinor was sicke. At which newes F. J. tooke small comfort: neuerthelesse Dame Venus with good aspect dyd yet thus much furder his enterprise. The Dame (whether it were by sodain chaunge, or of wonted custome) fell one day into a great bleeding at the nose. For which accident the said F. J. amongst other prety coceits, hath a present remedy, wherby he tooke occasion (when they of the house had all in vayne sought many ways to stop hir bleeding) to worke his feate in this wyse: First he pleaded ignorance, as though he knewe not hir name, and therefore demaunded the same of one other Gentlewoma in the house, whose name was Mistres Frances, who when shee had to him declared that hir name was Elinor , hee said these wordes or very lyke in effect: If I thought I should not offend Mystres Elynor , I would not doubt to stop hir bleeding, without eyther payne or difficulty. This gentlewoman somewhat tyckled wyth hys words, did incontinent make relacion thereof to the sayd Mystres Elynor , who immediately (declaring that F. J. was hir late receyued seruaunt) returned the sayd messanger vnto him with especiall charge, that hee shoulde employ his deuoyre towards the recouery of hir health, with whom the same F. J. repayred to the chamber of his desired: and finding hir sette in a chayre, leaning on the one side ouer a siluer bason: After his due reuerence, hee layd his hand on hir temples, and priuily rounding hir in hir eare, desired hir to commaund a Hazell sticke and a knyfe: the which being brought, hee deliuered vnto hir, saying on this wyse. Mystres I wil speak certen words in secret to my selfe, and doe require no more: but when you heare me saie openly this word Amen , that you with this knyfe will make a nycke vppon this hasell stycke: and when you haue made fyue nickes, commaunde mee also to cease. The Dame partly of good wil to the knight, and partly to be stenched of hir bleeding, commaunded hir mayd, and required the other gentils, somewhat to stand asyde, which done, he began his oraisons, wherein he had not long muttered before he pronounced Amen , wherewith the Lady made a nyck on the stick with hir knyfe. The said F. J. continued to an other Amen , when the Lady hauing made an other nyck felt hir bleeding, began to steynch: and so by the third Amen throughly steinched. F. J. then chaunging his prayers into priuate talk, said softly vnto hir. Mystres, I am glad that I am hereby enabled to do you some seruice, and as the staunching of your own bloud may some way recofort you, so if ye shedding of my bloud may any way content you; I beseech you commaund it, for it shalbe euermore readily employed in your seruice, and therwithal with a loud voyce pronounced Amen: wherwith the good Lady making a nyck did secretly answere thus. Good seruaunt (quod shee) I must needs think my self right happy to haue gained your seruice and good will, and be you sure, that although ther be in me no such desert as may draw you into this depth of affection, yet such as I am, I shalbe alwayes glad to shewe my self thankfull vnto you, and now, if you think your self assured, that I shall bleede no more, doe the pronounce your fifth Amen , the which pronounced, shee made also hir fifth nicke, and held vp hir head, calling the company vnto hir, and declaring vnto them, that hir bleeding was throughly steinched. Well, it were long to tell, what sundry opinions were pronounced vpon this acte, and I doe dwell ouerlong in the discourses of this F. I. especially hauing taken in hand only to copie out his verses, but for the circumstace doth better declare the effect, I will returne to my former tale. F. J. tarying a while in the chamber found oportunitie to loose his sequence neere to his desired Mistres: And after cong e taken departed. After whose departure the Lady arose out of hir chayre, & hir mayd going about to remoue the same, espied, & tooke vp the writing: the which hir mistres perceiuing, gan sodenly coiecture that ye same had in it some like matter to the verses once before left in like maner, & made semblat to mistrust that the same shuld be some words of coiuration: and taking it fro hir mayd, did peruse it, & immediatly said to the copany, that she would not forgo the same for a great treasure. But to be plain, I think that ( F. J. excepted) she was glad to be rid of all copany, vntill shee had with sufficient leasure turned ouer  & retossed euery card in this sequece. And not long after being now tickled thorough all the vaines with an vnknown humour, aduentured of hir self to comit vnto a like Ambassadour the discyphring of that which hitherto she had kept more secret, & therupo wrot with hir own hand & head in this wyse, G. T. great comfort by your meanes in the steinching of my bloud, and I take great cofort to reade your letters, and I haue found in my chamber diuers songs which I think to be of your making, and I promise you, they are excellently made, and I assure you that I wilbe ready to doe for you any pleasure that I can, during my lyfe: wherefore I pray you come to my chamber once in a day, till I come abroad again, and I wilbe glad of your company, and for because that you haue promised to bee my HE: I will take vpon me this name, your SHE. This letter I haue seene, of hir own hand writing: and as therin the Reader may finde great difference of Style, from hir former letter, so may you nowe vnderstand the cause. Shee had in the same house a friend, a seruaunt, a Secretary: what should I name him? such one as shee esteemed in time past more than was cause in tyme present, and to make my tale good, I will (by report of my very good friend F. J. ) discribe him vnto you. Hee was in height, the proportion of twoo Pigmeys , in bredth the thicknesse of two bacon hogges, of presumption a Gyant , of power a Gnat, Apishly wytted, Knauishly mannerd,  & crabbedly fauord, what was there in him then to drawe a fayre Ladies liking? Marry sir euen all in all, a well lyned pursse, wherwith he could at euery call, prouide such pretie conceytes as pleased hir peeuish fantasie, and by that meanes he had throughly (long before) insinuated him selfe with this amorous dame. This manling, this minion, this slaue, this secretary, was nowe by occasion rydden to London forsothe: and though his absence were vnto hir a disfurnishing of eloquence: it was yet vnto F. J. an opertunitie of good aduautage, for when he perceiued the change of hir stile, and therby grew in some suspicion that the same proceded by absence of hir chiefe Chauncellor, he thought good now to smyte while the yron was hotte, and to lend his Mistresse such a penne in hir Secretaries absence, as he should neuer be able at his returne to amende the well writing thereof, wherfore according to hir commaund he repayred once euery daye to hir chamber, at the least, whereas he guided him selfe so wel, and could deuise such store of sundry pleasures and pastymes, that he grew in fauour not onely with his desired, but also with the rest of the gentlewomen. And one daye passing the time amongst them, their playe grew to this end, that his Mistresse, being Queene, demaunded of him these three questions. Seruaunt (quod she) I charge you, aswell vppon your allegiance being nowe my subiect, as also vppon your fidelitie, hauing vowed your seruice vnto mee that you aunswere me these three questions, by the very truth of your secret thought. First, what thing in this vniuersall world doth most reioyce and comforte you? F. I. abasing his eyes towardes the ground, toke good aduisement in his aunswere, when a fayre gentlewoman of the company clapped him on the shoulder, saying, how now sir, is your had on your halfpeny? To whom he aunswered, no fayre Lady, my hand is on my harte, and yet my hart is not in myne owne handes: wherewithall abashed turning towardes dame Elinor he sayed. My souereigne  & Mistresse, according to the charge of your commaund, and the dutie that I owe you, my tongue shal bewraye vnto you the truth of myne intent. At this present a rewarde giuen me without desert, doth so reioyce mee with continuall remembraunce therof, that though my mind be so occupied to thinke thereon, as that daye nor night I can be quiet from that thought, yet the ioye and pleasure which I conceiue in the same is such, that I can neither be cloyed with continuaunce therof, nor yet afrayde, that any mishap can counteruayle so great a treasure. This is to me such a heauen to dwell in, as that I feede by day, and repose by night, vpon the fresh record of this reward, this (as he sayeth) he ment by the kysse that she lent him in the Gallery, and by the profession of hir last letters and wordes. Well, though this aunswere be somewhat mistie, yet let my friendes excuse be: that taken vppon the sodeyne he thought better to aunswere darkely, than to be mistrusted openly. Hir second questio was, what thing in this life did moste greue his harte, and disquiet his mind, whereunto he answered. That although his late rehersed ioye were incomparable, yet the greatest enimie that disturbed the same, was the priuie worme of his owne giltie conscience, which accused him euermore with great vnworthinesse: and that this was his greatest grief. The Lady byting vppon the bit at his cunning answeres made vnto these two questions, gan thus replie. Seruant, I had thought to haue touched you yet nearer with my third question, but I will refrayne to attempt your pacience: and now for my third demaud, aunswere me directly in what manner this passion doth handle you? and howe these contraries maye hang together by any possibilitie of concorde? for your wordes are strauunge. F. I. now rowsing him selfe boldly toke occasion thus to handle his aunswere. Mistresse (quod he) my wordes in dede are straunge, but yet my passion is is much straunger, and theruppon this other day to content mine owne fatasie I deuised a Sonet , which although it be a peece of Cocklorells musicke, and such as I might be ashamed to publish in this company, yet because my truth in this aunswere may the better appeare vnto you, I pray you vouchsafe to receiue the same in writing: and drawing a paper out of his packet presented it vnto hir, wherin was written this Sonet . G. T.  As neuer man but I led such a life. First burning loue doth wound my hart to death, And when death comes at call of inward griefe Colde lingering hope, doth feede my fainting breath Against my will, and yeeldes my wound reliefe: So that I liue, but yet my life is such, As death would neuer greue me halfe so much. No comfort then but only this J tast, To salue such sore, such hope will neuer want, And with such hope, such life will euer last, And with such life, such sorrowes are not skant. Oh straunge desire, O life with torments tost Through too much hope, mine onely hope is lost. Euen HE. F. I.  This Sonet was highly commended, and in my iudgement it deserueth no lesse, I haue heard F. I. saye, that he borowed th'inuentiun of an Jtalian: but were it a translation or inuention (if I be Iudge) it is both prety and pithy. His dutie thus perfourmed, their pastimes ended, and at their departure for a watch worde hee counselled his Mistresse by little and little to walke abrode, sayinge that the Gallery neare adioyning was so pleasaunt, as if he were halfe dead hee thought that by walking therin he might bee halfe and more reuiued. Thinke you so seruaunt (quod she?) and the last tyme that I walked there I suppose I toke the cause of my mallady, but by your aduise (and for you haue so clerkly steynched my bleeding) I will assaye to walke there to morow. Mistres quod he, and in more ful accomplishment of my duetie towards you, and in sure hope that you wil vse ye same onelie to your owne priuate comoditie, wil there awaite vppon you,  & betwene you & me wil teach you the ful order how to steynch the bleeding of any creature, wherby you shall be as cuning as my selfe. Gramercy good seruaunt, qd she, I thinke you lost the same in writing here yesterday, but I cannot vnderstand it, and therfore to morrowe (if I feele my selfe any thing amended) I wil send for you thither to enstruct me throughly: thus they departed. And at supper time, the Knight of the Castel finding fault that his gestes stomacke serued him no better, began to accuse the grosenes of his vyands, to whom one of the gentlewomen which had passed the afternoone in his company, aunswered. Nay sir, qd she, this gentleman hath a passio, the which once once in a daye at the least doth kill his appetite. Are you so well acquainted with the disposition of his body qd the Lord of the house? by his owne saying, qd she, & not otherwise. Fayre Ladie qd F. I. you either mistoke me or ouerheard me then, for I told of a comfortable humor which so fed me with continual remebrance of ioye, as yt my stomack being ful therof doth desire in maner none other vittayles. Why sir, qd ye host, do you then liue by loue? God forbid Sir quod F. I. for then my cheekes wold be much thinner then they be, but there are diuers other greater causes of ioy, then ye doubtful lottes of loue, and for myne owne part, to be playne, I cannot loue, and I dare not hate. I would I thought so, quod the gentlewoman. And thus with prety nyppes, they passed ouer their supper: which ended, the Lord of the house required F. I. to daunce and passe the tyme with the gentlewoman, which he refused not to doe. But sodenly, before the musicke was well tuned, came out Dame Elynor in hir night attyre, and said to the Lord, that (supposing the solitarinesse of hir chaber had encreased hir maladie) she came out for hir better recreacio to see them dauce. Wel done daughter (quod the Lord.) And I Mistres (quod F. J. ) would gladly bestowe the leading of you about this great chamber, to dryue away the fayntnesse of your feuer. No good seruaunt, quod the Lady, but in my steede, I pray you daunce with this fayre Gentlewoman, pointing him to the Lady that had so taken him vp at supper. F. J. to auoyde mistrust, did agree to hir request without furder entreaty. The daunce begon, this Knight marched on with the Image of S. Fraunces in his hand, and S. Elynor in his hart. The violands at ende of the pauion staied a whyle: in which time this Dame sayde to F. J. on this wyse. I am right sorry for you in two respects, although the familiarity haue hytherto had no great continuance betwene vs: and as I do lament your case, so doo I reioyce (for myne own contentation) that I shall now see a due triall of the experiment which I haue long desired. This sayd, she kept silence. When F. J. (somewhat astonied with hir straunge speeche) thus aunswered: Mystres although I cannot conceyue the meaning of your wordes, yet by curtesy I am constrayned to yeelde you thankes for your good will, the which appeareth no lesse in lamenting of mishaps, than in reioycing at good fortune. What experiment you meane to trye by mee, I know not, but I dare assure you, that my skill in experiments is very simple. Herewith the Instruments sounded a new Measure, and they passed forthwardes, leauing to talke, vntill the noyse ceassed: which done, the gentlewoman replied. I am sory sir, that you did erewhile, denie loue and all his lawes, and that in so open audience. Not so quod F. I. but as the word was roundly taken, so can I readely aunswere it by good reason. Wel quod she, how if the hearers will admit no reasonable aunswere? My reason shall yet be neuerthelesse (quod he) in reasonable iudgement. Herewith she smyled, and he cast a glance towardes dame Elinor askances art thou pleased? Againe the vyols called them forthwardes, and againe at the end of the braule sayd F. J. to this gentlewoman: I pray you Mistres, and what may be the second cause of your sorow sustained in my behalfe? Nay soft quod she, percase I haue not yet told you the first, but content your selfe, for the second cause you shall neuer know at my handes, vntill I see due trial of the experiment which I haue long desired. Why then (quod [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD5418&area=prose&forward=textsFT) she) I can but wish a present occasion to bring ye same to effect, to ye end that I might also vnderstad ye mistery of your meaning. And so might you fail of your purpose (quod she) for I meane to be better assured of him that shall know the depth of mine intent in such a secrete, than I do suppose that any creature (one except) may be of you. Gentlewoma (quod he) you speak Greeke , the which I haue now forgotten, and myne instructers are to farre from mee at this present to expound your words. Or els to neare (quod she) and so smiling stayed hir talke, when the musick called them to another dauce. Which ended, F. I. halfe afrayd of false suspect, and more amazed at this straunge talke, gaue ouer, and bringing Mistresse Fraunces to hir place was thus saluted by his Mistresse. Seruaunt (quod she) I hadde done you great wrong to haue daunced with you, considering that this gentlewoman and you had former occasion of so waighty conference. Mistresse sayd F. J. you had done mee great pleasure, for by our conference I haue but brought my braynes in a busie coniecture. I doubt not (sayd his Mistresse) but you wil end that busines easely. It is hard said F. I. to end the thing, wherof yet I haue founde no beginning. His Mistresse with change of countenaunce kept silence, whereat dame Fraunces reioycing, cast out this bone to gnawe on. I perceyue (quod she) it is euill to halt before a Creple. F. I. perceyuing now that his Mistresse waxed angry, thought good on hir behalfe thus to aunswere: and it is euill to hop before them that runne for the Bell: his Mistresse replied, and it is euill to hang the Bell at their heeles which are alwayes running. The L. of he Castle ouerhearing these proper quippes, rose out of his chayre, and comming towards F. I. required him to daunce a Gallyard, Sir sayd F. I. I haue hitherto at your apoyntment but walked about the house, now if you be desirous to see one tomble a turne or twayne, it is like ynough that I might prouoke you to laugh at mee, but in good faith my dauncing dayes are almost done, and therfore sir (quod he) I pray you speake to them that are more nymble at tripping on the toe. Whilest hee was thus saying dame Elynor had made hir Congey , and was now entring the doore of hir chamber: when F. I. all amazed at hir sodeyne departure followed to take leaue of his Mistresse: but she more then angrie, refused to heare his good night, and entring hir chamber caused hir mayde to clappe the doore. F. I. with heauie cheare returned to his company, and Mistresse Fraunces to toutch his sore with a corosiue sayd to him softly in this wise. Sir you may now perceyue that this our countrie cannot allowe the French maner of dauncing, for they (as I haue heard tell) do more commonly daunce to talke, then entreate to daunce. F. I. hoping to driue out one nayle with another, and thinking this a meane most conuenient to suppresse all ielous supposes, toke Mistresse Fraunces by the hande and with a heauie smyle aunswered. Mistresse and I (because I haue seene the french maner of dauncing) will eftsones entreat you to daunce a Bargynet: what meane you by this quod Mistresse Fraunces . If it please you to followe (quod he) you shall see that I can iest without ioye, and laugh without lust, and calling the musitions, caused them softly to sound the Tyntarnell , when he clearing his voyce did Alla Napolitana applie these verses following, vnto the measure. G. T.  And nature taught the way to loue, how J might best begin: To please my wandring eye, in beauties tickle trade, To gaze on eche that passed by, a carelesse sporte J made. With sweete entising bayte, J fisht for many a dame, And warmed me by many a fire, yet felt J not the flame: But when at last J spied, the face that please me most, The coales were quicke, the wood was drie, & J began to toste. And smyling yet full oft, J haue beheld that face, When in my hart J might bewayle mine owne vnluckie case: And oft againe with lokes that might bewray my griefe, J pleaded hard for iust reward, and sought to find reliefe. What will you more? so oft, my gazing eyes did seeke To see the Rose and Lilly striue vppon that liuely cheeke: Till at the last J spied, and by good profe I found, That in that face was paynted playne, the pearcer of my woud. Then (all to late) agast, J did my foote reitre, And sought with secrete sighes to quench my greedy skalding fire: But lo, I did preuayle asmuch to guide my will, As he that seekes with halting heele, to hop against the hill. Or as the feeble sight, would serche the sunny beame, Euen so J found but labour lost, to striue against the streame. Then gan J thus resolue, since liking forced loue, Should J mislike my happie choyce, before J did it proue? And since none other ioye J had but hir to see, Should J retire my deepe desire? no no it would not bee: Though great the duetie were, that she did well deserue, And J poore man, vnworthy am so worthy a wight to serue. Yet hope my comfort stayd, that she would haue regard To my good will, that nothing crau'd, but like for iust reward: J see the Faucon gent sometimes will take delight, To seeke the sollace of hir wing, and dally with a kite. The fayrest Woulf will chuse the foulest for hir make, And why? because he doth endure most sorrowe for hir sake. Euen so had J like hope, when dolefull dayes were spent When weary wordes were wasted well, to open true entent. When fluddes of flowing teares, had washt my weeping eyes, When trembling tongue had troubled hir, with loude lamenting cries. At last hir worthy wil would pitie this my playnt, And comfort me hir owne poore slaue, whom feare had made so faint. Wherfore J made a vow, the stonie rocke should start, Ere J presume, to let hir slippe out of my faithfull hart. And when she sawe by proofe, the pith of my good will, She tooke in worth this simple song, for want of better skill. And as my iust deserts, hir gentle hart did moue, She was content to answere thus: I am content to loue. F. I. These verses are more in number than do stand with contentation of some iudgements, and yit the occasio throughly considered, I can commend them with the rest, for it is (as may be well termed) continua oratio , declaring a full discourse of his first loue: wherin (ouer and besides that the Epythetes are aptly applied,  & the verse of it self pleasant enough) I note that by it he ment in cloudes to discipher vnto Mistres Fraunces such matter as she wold snatch at, and yit could take no good hold of the same. Furthermore, it aunswered very aptly to the note which the musike sounded, as the skilfull reader by due triall may approue. This singing daunce, or daunsing song ended, Mistres Fraunces giuing due thanks, seemed weary also of the company, and profering to departe, gaue yit this farewell to F. J. not vexed by choller, but pleased with contentation, and called away by heauy sleepe: I am constreyned (quod she) to bid you good night, and so turning to the rest of the company, tooke hir leaue. Then the Maister of the house commaunded a torch to light F. J. to his lodging, where (as I haue heard him saye) the sodeyn chaunge of his Mistres countenance, togither with the straungenes of Mistresse Fraunces talke, made such an encounter in his mynde, that he could take no reste that night: wherefore in the morning rysing very earely (although it were farre before his Mistres hower) he cooled his choller by walking in the Gallery neare to hir lodging, and there in this passion compyled these verses following. G. T.  A cloud of care hath coured all my coste, And stormes of stryfe doo threaten to appeare: The waues of woo, which J mistrusted moste, Haue broke the bankes wherein my lyfe lay cleere: Chippes of ill chaunce, are fallen amyd my choyce, To marre the mynd, that ment for to reioyce. Before J sought, J found the hauen of hap, Wherein (once found) J sought to shrowd my ship, But lowring loue hath lift me from hir lap, And crabbed lot beginnes to hang the lip: The droppes of dark mistrust do fall so thick. They pearce my coate, and touch my skin at quick. What may be sayd, where truth cannot preuayle? What plea may serue, where will it selfe is Iudge? What reason rules, where right and reason fayle? Remediles then must the giltlesse trudge: And seeke out care, to be the caruing knyfe To cut the thred, that lingreth such a lyfe. F. J. This is but a rough meeter, and reason, for it was deuised in great disquiet of mynd, and written in rage, yet haue I seene much worse passe the musters, yea and where both the Lieutenant and Prouost Marshall were men of rype iudgement: and as it is, I pray you let it passe here, for the truth is that F. J. himselfe had so slender liking thereof, or at least of one worde escaped therin, that he neuer presented it, but to ye matter. Whe he had long (and all in vayn) looked for the coming of his Mistres into hir appointed walk: he wandred into ye park neere adioyning to the Castle wall, where his chaunce was to meete Mistresse Fraunces , accompanied with one other Gentlewoman, by whom he passed with a reuerece of curtesie: and so walking on, came into the side of a thicket, where he sat down vnder a tree to allay his sadnesse with solitarines. Mistres Fraunces , partly of curtesie and affection, and partly to content hir mind by continuance of such talk as thei had commenced ouer night, entreated hir companion to goe with hir vnto this tree of reformacion, whereas they found the Knight with his armes vnfolded in a heauy kind of contemplation, vnto whom Mistres Fraunces stepped apace, (right softly)  & at vnwares gaue this salutation. I little thought Syr Knight (quod she) by your euensong yesternight, to haue found you presently at such a morrow masse, but I perceiue you serue your Saint with double deuotion: and I pray God graut you treble meede for your true intent. F. J. taken thus vpon the sodeine, could none otherwise answer but thus: I told you Mistresse (quod he) that I could laughe without lust, and iest without ioye: and there withall starting vp, with a more bolde countenance came towardes the Dames, profering vnto them his seruice, to wayte vpon the homewards. I haue heard say oft times (qd Mistres Fraunces ) that it is hard to serue two Maisters at one time, but we wilbe right glad of your company. I thank you (quod F. J. ) and so walking on with them, fell into sundry discourses, still refusing to touch any part of their former communicacion, vntill Mistresse Fraunces sayd vnto him: by my troth (quod shee) I would bee your debtour these two dayes, to aunswer me truely but vnto one question that I will propound: fayre Gentlewoman (quod hee) you shall not neede to becomme my debtour, but if it please you to quit question by questio, I wil be more ready to gratifie you in this request, than either reason requireth, or than you would be willing to worke my cotentatio. Master F. J. (qd she,  & yt sadly) peraduetur you know but a litle how willing I would be to procure your contentation, but you know that hitherto familiaritie hath taken no deepe roote betwixt vs twayne. And though I find in you no maner of cause whereby I might doubt to commit this or greater matter vnto you, yit haue I stayed hitherto so to doe, in doubt least you might thereby iustly condempne mee both of arrogancy and lack of discretion, wherwith I must yit foolishly affirm, that I haue with great payne brydeled my tonge from disclosing the same vnto you. Such is then the good will that I beare towards you, the which if you rather iudge to bee impudencie, than a friendly meaning, I may then curse the hower that I first concluded thus to deale with you: herewithall being now red for chaste bashefulnesse, shee abased hir eyes, and stayed hir talke, to whom F. J. thus aunswered. Mistresse Fraunces , if I should with so exceeding villanie requite such and so exceeding courtesie, I might not onely seeme to digenerate from all gentry, but also to differ in behauiour from all the rest of my lyfe spent: wherefore to be playne with you in few wordes, I thinke my self so much bound vnto you for diuers respects, as if abilitie doe not fayle mee, you shall fynde mee myndfull in requitall of the same: and for disclosing your mind to mee, you may if so please you aduenture it without aduenture, for by this Sunne, quod hee, I will not deceyue such trust as you shall lay vppon mee, and furthermore, so farre foorth as I may, I wilbe yours in any respect: wherfore I beseech you accept me for your faithfull friend, and so shall you surely find mee. Not so, quod shee, but you shalbe my Trust , if you vouchsafe the name, and I wilbe to you as you shall please to terme mee: my Hope (quod hee) if you so be pleased and: thus agreed, they two walked a parte from the other Gentlewoman, and fell into sad talke, wherein Mistresse Fraunces dyd very curteousely declare vnto him, that in deed, one cause of hir sorrow susteyned in his behalfe, was that he had sayd so openly ouer night, that hee could not loue, for shee perceyued very well the affection betweene him and Madame Elynor , and she was also aduertised that Dame Elynor stood in the portall of hir chamber, harkening to the talke that they had at supper that night, wherefore she seemed to be sory that such a woord (rashely escaped) might become great hinderaunce vnto his desire: but a greater cause of hir grief was (as she declared) that hys hap was to bestowe his lyking so vnworthely, for shee seemed to accuse Dame Elynor , for the most vnconstant woman lyuing: In full profe whereof, she bewrayed vnto F. J. how she the same Dame Elynor , had of long time ben yeelded to the Mynion Secretary , whom I haue before described: in whom though there bee (quod shee) no one point of worthynesse, yit shameth she not to vse him as hir dearest friend, or rather hir holyest Idoll, and that this not withstanding Dame Elynor had bene also sundry tymes woone to choyce of chaunge, as she named vnto F. I. two Gentlemen whereof the one was named H. D. and that other H. K. by whom shee was during sundry tymes of their seuerall aboad in those parties, entreated to like curteousie, for these causes the Dame Fraunces seemed to mislike F. J. choice, and to lament that she doubted in processe of time to see him abused. The experiment she ment was this, for that she thought F. J. (I vse hir wordes) a man in euery respect very woorthy to haue the seuerall vse of a more commodious common, she hoped nowe to see if his enclosure thereof might be defensible against hir sayd Secretary, and such like. These things and diuers other of great importance, this courteouse Lady Fraunces did friendly disclose vnto F. J. and furthermore, did both instruct and aduise him how to proceede in his enterprise. Now to make my talke good, and least the Reader might bee drawen in a ielouse suppose of this Lady Fraunces , I must let you vnderstand that shee was vnto F. J. a kinswoman, a virgin of rare chastitie, singular capacitie, notable modestie, and excellent beauty: and though F. J. had cast his affection on the other (being a married woman) yit was ther in their beauties no great difference: but in all other good giftes a wonderfull diuersitie, as much as might be betwene constancie  & flitting fantasie, betwene womaly coutenance & girlish garishnes, betwene hot dissimulacion & temperate fidelitie. Now if any man will curiously aske the question why F. J. should chuse the one and leaue the other, ouer and besides the comon prouerbe? ( So many men so many minds ) thus may be answered: we see by comon experience, yt the highest flying faucon, doth more comonly pray vpo the corn fed crow,  & the simple shiftles doue, then on the mounting kyte: and why? because the one is ouercome with lesse difficultie then that other. Thus much in defence of this Lady Fraunces ,  & to excuse the choice of my friend F. J. who thought himself now no lesse beholding to good fortune, to haue found such a trusty friend, then bounden to Dame Venus , to haue wonne such a Mistres. And to returne vnto my pretence, vnderstand you, yt F. J. (being now with these two fair Ladies come very neer the castel) grewe in some ielouse doubt (as on his own behalf) whether he were best to break copany or not. Whe his assured Hope , perceiuing the same, gan thus recomfort him: Good sir (qd she) if you trusted your trusty friends, you should not neede thus cowardly to stand in dread of your friendly enimies. Well said in faith (quod F. I. and I must confesse, you were in my bosome before I wist, but yit I haue heard said often, that in Trust is treason. Wel spoke for your self quod his Hope. F. J. now remembring that he had but erewhile taken vpon him ye name of hir Trust , came home per misericordiam , when his Hope entring the Castle gate, caught hold of his lay, and half by force led him by the gallery vnto his Mistres chaber: wheras after a little dissembling disdain, he was at last by the good helpe of his Hope , right thankfully receyued: and for his Mistres was now ready to dyne, he was therfore for that time arested there,  & a supersedias sent into the great chaber vnto the Lord of the house, who expected his coming out of the parke. The dinner ended,  & he throughly contented both wt welfare & welcome, they fell into sundry deuices of pastime: at last F. J. taking into his hand a Lute that lay on his Mistres bed, did vnto the note of ye Venetian galliard applie the Jtalian dittie writte by the woorthy Bradamant vnto the noble Rugier , as Ariosto hath it. Rugier qual semper fui, &c. but his Mistres could not be quiet vntil shee heard him repeat the Tyntarnell which he vsed ouer night, the which F. J. refused not, at end wherof his Mistres thinking now she had shewed hir self to earnest to vse any further dissimulation, especially perceiuing the toward enclination of hir seruaunts Hope , fell to flat playn dealing, and walking to the window, called hir seruaunt apart vnto hir, of whom she demaunded secretly  & in sad earnest, who deuised this Tyntarnell? My Fathers Sisters brothers sonne (quod F. I. ) His Mistresse laughing right hartely, demaunded yit again, by whom the same was figured: by a niece to an Aunt of yours, Mistres (quod he). Well then seruaunt (quod she) I sweare vnto you here by my Fathers soule, yt my mothers youngest daughter, doth loue your fathers eldest son, aboue any creature liuing. F. J. hereby recoforted, gan thus reply. Mistres, though my fathers eldest son be far vnworthy of so noble a match, yit since it pleseth hir so well to accept him, I would thus much say behind his back, yt your mothers daughter hath done him som wroge  & wherin seruaut (qd she) by my troth Mrs (qd he) it is not yit xx. houres, since without touch of brest she gaue him such a nip by the hart, as did altogither bereaue him his nights reste, with the bruse thereof. Well, seruaunt (quod she) content your selfe, and for your sake, I will speake to hir to prouide him a playster, the which I my selfe will applye to his hurt: And to the ende it may woorke the better with him, I will puruey a lodging for him, where hereafter he may sleepe at more quiet. This sayd the rosie hewe, distained hir sickly cheekes, and she returned to the company, leauing F. I. rauished betwene hope and dread, as one that could neyther coniecture the meaning of hir misticall wordes, nor assuredly trust vnto the knot of hir slyding affections. When the Lady Fraunces coming to him, demaunded, what? dreame you sir? Yea mary do I fayre Lady (quod he). And what was your dream, sir (quod she?) I drempt (quod F. I. ) that walking in a pleasaunt garden garnished with sundrie delights, my hap was to espie hanging in the ayre, a hope wherin I might well behold the aspectes and face of the heauens, and calling to remembrance the day and hower of my natiuitie, I did therby (according to my small skill in Astronomy) trie the conclusions of myne aduentures. And what found you therin (quod dame Fraunces? ) you awaked me out of my dreame (quod he) or ells paraduenture you should not haue knowne. I beleue you well (quod the Ladi Fraunces ) and laughing at his quicke aunswere brought him by the hand vnto the rest of his companie: where he taried not long before his gracious Mistresse bad him to farewell, and to kepe his hower there againe, when he should by hir be sommoned. Hereby F. J. passed the rest of that daye in hope awayting the happy time when his Mistresse shoulde sende for him. Supper time came and passed ouer, and not long after came the handmayd of the Lady Elynor into the great chamber, desiring F. I. to repayre vnto their Mistresse, the which hee willingly accomplished: and being now entred into hir chamber, he might perceyue his Mistresse in hir nightes attyre, preparinge hir selfe towardes bed, to whom F. J. sayed: Why howe now Mistresse? I had thought this night to haue sene you daunce (at least or at last) amongst vs? By my troth good seruaut (qd she) aduentured so soone vnto the great chamber yesternight, that I find my selfe somewhat sickly disposed and therfore do streyne curtesie (as you see) to go the soner to my bed this night: but before I slepe (quod she) I am to charge you with a matter of waight, and taking him apart from the rest, declared that (as that present night) she would talke with him more at large in the gallery neere aioyning to hir chamber. Here vppon F. J. discretely dissimuling his ioye, toke his leaue and returned into the great chamber, where he had not long continued before the Lord of the Castell commauded a torch to light him vnto his lodging, whereas he prepared himselfe and went to bed, commaunding his seruant also to go to his rest. And when he thought aswell his seruaunt, as the rest of the houshold to be safe, he arose again,  & taking his night gowne, did vnder the same conuey his naked sword, and so walked to the gallerie, where he found his good Mistresse walking in hir night gowne and attending his comming. The Moone was now at the full, the skies cleare, and the weather temperate, by reason wherof he might the more playnely and with the greater contentation behold his long desired ioyes, and spreding his armes abrode to embrace his louing Mistresse, he sayd: oh my deare Lady when shall I be able with any desert to counteruayle the least parte of this your bountifull goodnesse? The dame (whether it were of feare in deede, or that the wylynes of womanhode had taught hir to couer hir conceites with some fyne dissimulation) stert backe from the Knight, and shriching, (but softly) sayd vnto him. Alas seruaunt what haue I deserued, that you come against me with naked sword as against an open enimie. F. I. perceyuing hir entent excused himselfe, declaring that he brought the same for their defence,  & not to offend hir in any wise. The Ladie being therwith somwhat apeased, they began wt more cofortable gesture to expell the dread of the said late affright, and sithens to become bolder of behauiour, more familier in speech, & most kind in accomplishing of comon comfort. But why hold I so long discourse in discribing the ioyes which (for lacke of like experience) I cannot set out to ye ful? Were it not that I knowe to whom I write, I would the more beware what I write. F. I. was a man, and neither of vs are sencelesse, and therfore I shold slaunder him, (ouer and besides a greater obloquie to the whole genealogie of En aeas ) if I should imagine that of tender hart he would forbeare to expresse hir more tender limbes against the hard floore. Suffised that of hir curteouse nature she was content to accept bords for a bead of downe, mattes for Camerike sheetes, and the night gowne of F. I. for a counterpoynt to couer them, and thus with calme cotent, in steede of quiet sleepe, they beguiled the night, vntill the proudest sterre began to abandon the fyrmament, when F. I. and his Mistresse, were constrayned also to abandon their delightes, and with ten thousand sweet kisses and straight embracings, did frame themselues to play loth to depart. Wel, remedie was there none, but dame Elynor must returne vnto hir chamber, and F. J. must also conuey himselfe (as closely as might be) into his chamber, the which was hard to do, the day being so farre sprong, and hee hauing a large base court to passe ouer before he could recouer his staire foote doore. And though he were not much perceyued, yet the Ladie Fraunces being no lesse desirous to see an issue of these enterprises, then F. J. was willing to couer them in secresy, did watch,  & euen at the entring of his chamber doore, perceyued the poynt of his naked sworde glistring vnder the skyrt of his night gowne: wherat she smyled & said to hir selfe, this geare goeth well about. Wel, F. I. hauing now recouered his chamber, he went to bedde,  & there let him sleepe, as his Mistresse did on that otherside. Although the Lady Fraunces being throughly tickled now in all the vaynes, could not enioye such quiet rest, but arising, toke another gentlewoman of the house with hir, and walked into the parke to take the freshe ayre of the morning. They had not long walked there, but they retorned, and though F. J. had not yet slept sufficiently, for one which had so farre trauayled in the night past, yet they went into his chamber to rayse him, and comming to his beds side, found him fast on sleepe. Alas quod that other gentlewoman, it were pitie to awake him: euen so it were quod dame Fraunces , but we will take awaye somewhat of his, wherby he may perceyue that we were here, and loking about the chamber, his naked sworde presented it selfe to the handes of dame Fraunces , who toke it with hir, and softly shutting his chamber doore againe, went downe the stayres and recouered hir owne lodging, in good order and vnperceyued of any body, sauing onely that other gentlewoman which accompanied hir. At the last F. I. awaked, and apparreling himselfe, walked out also to take the ayre, and being throughly recomforted aswell with remembraunce of his ioyes forepassed, as also with the pleasaunt hermony which the Byrdes made on euery side, and the fragrant smel of the redolent flowers and blossomes which budded on euery braunche: hee did in these delightes compyle these verses following. ¶The occasion (as I haue heard him rehearse) was by encouter that he had with his Lady by light of the moone: and forasmuch, as the moone in middes of their delights did vanish away, or was ouerspred with a cloud, thereuppon he toke the subiect of his theame. And thus it ensueth, called a mooneshine Banquet. G. T.  And deyneth not to leaue hir loftie place: But only then, when Phoebus shewes his face Which is hir brother borne and lends hir light,) Disdaynd not yet to do my Lady right: To proue that in such heauenly wightes as she, Jt sitteth best that right and reason be. For when she spied my Ladies golden rayes, Into the cloudes, Hir head she shrouds, And shamed to shine where she hir beames displayes. Good reason yet, that to my simple skill, J should the name of Cynthia adore: By whose high helpe, I might behold the more My Ladies louely lookes at mine owne wil, With deepe content, to gare, and gaze my fil: Of curteousie and not of darke disdaine, Dame Cinthia disclosd my Lady playne. She did but lend hir light (as for a lyte) With friendly grace, To shewe hir face, That els would shew and shine in hir dispight. Dan Phoebus he with many a lowring loke, Had hir beheld of yore in angry wise: And when he could none other meane deuise To stayne hir name, this deepe deceipt he toke To be the bayte that best might hide his hoke: Jnto hir eyes his parching beames he cast, To skorche their skinnes, that gaz'd on hir full fast: Whereby when many a man was sonne burnt so They thought my Queene, The sonne had been With skalding flames, which wrought them all that wo. And thus when many a looke had lookt so long, As that their eyes were dimme and dazled both: Some fainting hartes that were both leude and loth To loke againe from whence the error sprong, Gan close their eye for feare of further wrong: And some againe once drawne into the maze, Gan leudly blame the beames of beauties blaze: But I with deepe foresight did sone espie, How Phoebus ment, By false entent, To slaunder so hir name with crueltie. Wherfore at better leasure thought I best, To trie the treason of his trecherie: And to exalt my Ladies dignitie When Phoebus fled and drew him downe to rest Amid the waues that walter in the west. J gan behold this louely Ladies face, Whereon dame nature spent hir gifts of grace: And found therin no parching heat at all, But such bright hew, As might renew, An Angels ioyes in reigne celestiall. The curteouse Moone that wisht to do me good, Did shine to shew my dame more perfectly, But when she sawe hir passing iollitie, The Moone for shame, did blush as red as blood, And shronke aside and kept hir hornes in hood: So that now when Dame Cynthia was gone, J might enioye my Ladies lokes alone, Yet honored still the Moone with true intent: Who taught vs skill, To worke our will, And gaue vs place, till all the night was spent. F. I. This Ballade, or howsoeuer I shall terme it, percase you will not like, and yet in my iudgement it hath great good store of deepe inuention, and for the order of the verse, it is not common, I haue not heard many of like proportion, some will accompt it but a dyddeldeme: but who so had heard F. I sing it to the lute, by a note of his owne deuise, I suppose he would esteme it to bee a pleasaunt diddeldome, and for my part, if I were not parciall, I woulde saye more in commendacion of it than nowe I meane to do, leauing it to your and like iudgementes. And nowe to returne to my tale, by that time, that F. J. retorned out of the parke, it was dynner time, and at dynner they all met, I meane both dame Elynor , dame Fraunces , and F. J. I leaue to discribe that the Lady Fraunces was gorgeously attired, and set forth with very braue apparell, and Madame Elynor onely in hir night gowne gyrt to hir, with a coyfe trymmed Alla Piedmonteze , on the which she ware a little cap crossed ouer the crowne with two bends of yellowe Sarcenet or Cipresse, in the middest whereof she had placed (of hir owne hand writing in paper this word, Contented . This attyre pleased hir then to vse, and could not haue displeased Mistresse Fraunces , had she not bene more priuy to the cause, than to the thing it selfe: at least the Lord of the Castle of ignoraunce, and dame Fraunces of great temporance, let it passe without offence. At dynner, bicause the one was pleased with all former reconninges, and the other made priuie to the accompt, there passed no word of taunt or grudge, but omnia bene . After dynner dame Elinor being no lesse desirouse to haue F. J. company, then dame Fraunces was to take him in some pretie trippe, they began to questio how they might best passe the day: the Lady Elynor seemed desirous to kepe her chamber, but Mistresse Fraunces for another purpose seemed desirous to ryde abrode thereby to take the open ayre: they agreed to ryde a myle or twayne for sollace, and requested F. J. to accompany them, the which willingly graunted. Eche one parted from other, to prepare themselues, and now began the sporte, for when F. J. was booted, his horses sadled, and he ready to ryde, he gan mysse his Rapier, wherat al astonied he began to blame his man, but blame whom he would, found it could not be. At last the Ladies going towardes horsebacke, called for him in the base Court, and demaunded if he were readie: to whom F. J. aunswered. Madames I am more than readie, and yet not so ready as I would be, and immediatly taking him selfe in trip, he thought best to vtter no more of his conceipt, but in hast more than good speede mounted his horse,  & comming toward ye dames presented him self, turning, bounding, & taking vp his courser to the vttermost of his power in brauery: after suffering his horse to breath him selfe, he gan also allay his owne choller, & to the dames he sayd. Fayre Ladies I am ready when it pleaseth you to ryde where so you commaund. How ready soeuer you be seruaunt, quod dame Elinor , it seemeth your horse is readier at your commaunde then at oures. If he bee at my commaund Mistresse (quod hee,) he shalbe at yours. Gramercy good seruaunt (quod shee) but my meaning is, that I feare he be to stirring for our copany. If he proue so Mistres qd F. J. I haue here a soberer palfrey to serue you on. The Dames being mounted they rode forthwardes by the space of a myle or very neare, and F. J. (whether it were of his horses corage or his own choler) came not so neare them as they wished, at last the Lady Fraunces said vnto him: Maister J. you said that you had a soberer horse, which if it be so, we wold be glad of your company, but I beleue by your coutinance, your horse  & you are agreed. F. J. alighting called his seruaunt, chauged horses with him, and ouertaking the Dames, said to Mistres Fraunces: And why doe you thinke faire Lady that my horse and I are agreed? Bicause by your countenance (quod she) it seemeth your patience is stirred. In good faith, quod F. J. you haue gessed a right, but not with any of you. Then we care the lesse seruaunt, quod Dame Elinor . By my troth Mistres, qd F. J. (looking well about him that none might heare but they two) it is with my seruaunt, who hath lost my sword out of my chamber. Dame Elinor little remembring the occasion, replied it is no matter seruaunt, quod shee, you shall heare of it againe, I warrant you, and presently wee ryde in Gods peace, and I trust shall haue no neede of it: yet Mistresse quod he, a weapon serueth both vses, aswell to defend, as to offend. Now by my troth, quod Dame Fraunces , I haue now my dream, for I dreamt this night that I was in a pleasaunt meadow alone, where I met with a tall Gentleman, apparelled in a night gowne of silke all embroadered about with a gard of naked swords, and when he came towardes me I seemed to be afraide of him, but he recomforted me saying, be not afrayd fayre Lady, for I vse this garment onely for myne own defence: and in this sort went that warlicke God Mars what time hee taught dame Venus to make Vulcan a hamer of the newe fashion. Notwithstanding these comfortable wordes the fright of the dreame awaked me, and sithens vnto this hower I haue not slept at al. And what tyme of the night dreamt you this quod F. J? In the grey morning about dawning of ye day, but why aske you quod dame Frances? F. J. with a great sigh answered, because that dreames are to be marked more at some hower of the night, then at some other, why are you so cunning at the interpretation of dreames seruaunt (quod the Lady Elynor? ) not very cunning Mistresse quod F. J. but gesse, like a young scholler. The dames continued in these and like pleasant talkes: but F. J. could not be mery, as one that estemed the preseruation of his Mistresse honor no lesse then the obtayning of his owne delightes: and yet to auoyde further suspicion, he repressed his passions, asmuch as hee could. The Lady Elynor more carelesse then consideratiue of hir owne case, pricking forwardes said softly to F. I. I had thought you had receiued small cause seruaunt to bee thus dumpish, when I would be mery. Alas deere Mistresse quod F. J. it is altogether for your sake, that I am pensife: dame Fraunces with curtesie withdrewe hir selfe and gaue them leaue when as F. J. declared vnto his Mistresse, that his sword was taken out of his chamber, and that he dreaded much by the wordes of the Lady Fraunces , that she had some vnderstanding of the matter. Dame Elynor now calling to remembraunce what had passed the same night, at the first was abashed, but immediatly (for these women be redely wytted) chered hir seruaunt, and willed him to commit vnto hir the saluing of that sore. Thus they passed the rest of the waye in pleasaunt talke with dame Fraunces , and so returned towards the Castle where F. I. suffered the two dames to go together, and he alone vnto his chamber to bewayle his owne misgouernement. But dame Elynor (whether it wer according to olde custome, or by wylie pollicie) found meane that night, yt the sword was conueyed out of Mistres Fraunces chamber and brought vnto hirs and after redeliuerie of it vnto F. I. she warned him to be more wary from that time forthwards: well I dwell too long vppon these particular poynts in discoursing this trifling history, but that the same is the more apte meane of introduction to ye verses, which I meane to reherse vnto you, and I think you wil not disdaine to read my conceipt with his inuention about declaration of his commedie. The next that euer F. I. wrote the, vpon any adueture hapned betwene him and this fayre Lady, was this as I haue heard him say, and vppon this occasion. After he grew more bold  & better acquaynted with his Mistresse disposition, he aduentured one Fryday in the morning to go vnto hir chaber, and theruppon wrote as followeth: which he termed a Frydayes Breakefast. G. T.  When she doth raigne, that mockt Uulcane the Smith: And thought it meete to harbor in hir bower, Some gallant gest for hir to dally with. That blessed hower, that blist and happie daye, J thought it meete, with hastie steppes to go: Unto the lodge, wherein my Lady laye, To laugh for ioye, or ells to weepe for wo. And lo, my Lady of hir wonted grace, First lent hir lippes to me (as for a kisse:) And after that hir body to embrace, Wherein dame nature wrought nothing amisse. What followed next, gesse you that knowe the trade, For in this sort, my Frydayes feast J made. F. I. This Sonet is short and sweete, reasonably well, according to the occasion &c. Many dayes passed these two louers with great delight, their affayres being no lesse politikely gouerned, than happely atchiued. And surely I haue heard F. I. affirme in sad earnest, that hee did not onely loue hir, but was furthermore so rauished in Extasies with continual remembrance of his delights, that he made an Idoll of hir in his inward conceypte. So seemeth it by this challenge to beautie, which he wrote in hir prayse and vppon hir name. G. T.  My Nell hath stolen thy fynest stuff, & left thee in the lash: Thy marker now is marred, thy gaynes are gone god wot, Thou hast no ware, that may compare, with this that J haue got, As for thy paynted pale, and wrinckles surfled vp: Are deare inough, for such as lust to drinke of eu'ry cup: Thy bodies bolstred out, with bumbast and with bagges, Thy rowles, thy Ruffes, thy caules, thy coyfes, thy Jerkins & thy iugges. Thy curling and thy cost, thy frisling & thy fare, To Court to court with al those toyes, & there set forth such ware Before their hungry eyes, that gaze on euery gest: And chuse the cheapest chaffayre still to please their fansie best. But J whose stedfast eyes, could neuer cast a glance, With wadring loke, amid the prease, to take my choice by chauce Haue wonne by due desert, a piece that hath no peere, And left the rest as refuse all, to serue the market there: There let him chuse that list, there catch the best who can: A paynted blazing bayte may serue, to choke a gazing man, But J haue slipt thy flower, that freshest is of hewe, J haue thy corne, go sell thy chaff, J list to seeke no new: The wyndowes of myne eyes, are glaz'd with such delight, As eche new face seemes full of faultes, that blaseth in my sight: And not without iust cause. J can compare hir so, Lo here my gloue J challenge him, that can, or dare say no. Let Theseus come with clubbe, or Paris bragge with brand, To proue how fayre their Hellen was, that skourg'd the Grecian land: Let mighty Mars him selfe, come armed to the field: And vaunt dame Venus to defend, with helmet speare & shield This hand that had good hap, my Hellen to embrace, Shal haue like lucke to foyl hir foes, & daut them with disgrace. And cause them to confesse by verdict and by othe, How farre hir louely lookes do steyne the beauties of them both. And that my Hellen is more fayre then Paris wife, And doth deserue more famous praise, then Venus for hir life. Which if J not perfourme, my life then let me leese, Or elles be bound in chaines of change to begge for beauties fees. F. I. By this challenge I gesse, that either hee was than in an extasie or els sure I am now in a lunacie, for it is a proud challenge made to Beautie hir selfe, and all hir companyons and ymagining that Beautie hauing a shop where she vttred hir wares of all sundry sortes, his Ladie had stollen the fynest away, leauing none behind hir, but paynting, bolstring, forcing and such like, the which in his rage he iudgeth good ynough to serue the Courte: and theruppon grew a great quarrell. When these verses were by the negligence of his Mistresse dispersed into sundry hands, and so at last to the reading of a Courtier. Well F. J. had his desire if his Mistresse lyked them, but as I haue heard him declare, she grew in ieolosie, that the same were not written by hir, because hir name was Elynor and not Hellen . And about this poynt haue bene diuers and sundry opinions, for this and diuers other of his most notable Poems, haue come to view of ye world, although altogether wtout his cosent. And some haue attributed this prayse vnto a Hellen , who deserued not so well as this dame Elynor should seeme to deserue by the relation of F. I. and yet neuer a barell of good herring betwene them both. But that other Hellen , bycause she was and is of so base condicion, as may deserue no maner commendacion in any honest iudgement, therfore I will excuse my friend F. I. and aduenture my penne in his behalfe, that he would neuer bestow verse of so meane a subiect. And yet some of his acquayntance, being also acquainted (better than I,) that F. I. was sometimes acquaynted with Hellene , haue stoode in argument with mee, that it was written by Hellene and not by Elynor . Well F. I. tolde me himselfe that it was written by this dame Elynor , and that vnto hir he thus alleged, that he toke it all for one name, or at least he neuer red of any Elinor such matter as might sound worthy like commendation for beautie. And in deede, considering that it was in the first beginning of his writings, as then he was no writer of any long continuaunce comparing also the time that such reportes do spread of his acquayntaunce with Hellene it cannot be written lesse then sixe or seuen yeres before he knew Hellene: mary paraduenture if there were any acquayntance betwene F. J. and that Hellene afterwardes, (the which I dare not confesse) he might adapt it to hir name, and so make it serue both their turnes, as elder louers haue done before and still do and will do worlde without end. Amen . Well by whom he wrote it I know not, but once I am sure that he wrote it, for he is no borrower of inuentios, and this is al that I meane to proue, as one that sende you his verses by stealth, and do him double wrong, to disclose vnto any man the secrete causes why they were deuised, but this for your delight I do aduenture and to returne to the purpose, he sought more certaynely to please his Mistresse Elynor with this Sonet written in hir prayse as followeth. G. T.  About their neckes to beautifie their name: But she (whom J do serue) hir [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD5418&area=prose&forward=textsFT) peeres doth beare, Close in hir mouth, and smiling shewes the same. No wonder then, though eu'ry word she speakes, A Jewell seems in iudgment of the wise, Since that hir sugred tongue the passage breakes, Betwene two rocks, bedeckt with pearles of price. Hir haire of gold, hir front of Juory, (A bloudy hart within so white a brest) Hir teeth of Pearle, lippes Rubie, christall eye, Needes must J honour hir aboue the rest: Since she is fourmed of none other moulde, But Rubie, Christall, Juory, Pearle, and Golde. F. I. Of this Sonet I am assured that it is but a translation, for I my selfe haue seene the inuention of an Italian, and Master J. hath a little dylated the same, but not much besides the sence of the first, and the addicion very aptly applied: wherfore I cannot condempne his doing therin, and for the Sonet, were it not a little to much prayse (as the Italians do most commonly offend in the superlatiue) I could the more commend it: but I hope the partie to whom it was dedicated, had rather it were much more, than any thing lesse. Well, thus these two Louers passed many dayes in exceding contentation,  & more than speakeable pleasures, in which time F. I. did compyle very many verses according to sundrie occasions proffred, whereof I haue not obteyned the most at his handes, and the reason that he denied me the same, was that (as he alleged) they were for the most part sauced with a taste of glory, as you know that in such cases a louer being charged with inexpriuable ioyes, and therewith enioyned both by dutie and discretion to kepe the same couert, can by no meanes deuise a greater consolation, than to commit it into some cyphred wordes and figured speeches in verse, whereby he feeleth his harte halfe (or more than halfe) eased of swelling. For as sighes are some present ease to the pensife mind, euen so we find by experience, that such secrete entre comoning of ioyes doth encrease delight. I would not haue you conster my wordes to this effecte, that I thinke a man cannot sufficiently reioyce in the luckie lottes of loue, vnlesse he empart the same to others: God forbid that euer I should enter into such an heresie, for I haue alwayes bene of this opinion, that as to be fortunate in loue, is one of the most inward contentatious to mans mynde of all earthly ioyes: euen so if hee do but once bewray ye same to any liuing creature, imemdiatlye eyther dread of discouering doth bruse his brest with an intollerable burden, or els he leeseth the principall vertue which gaue effecte to his gladnes, not vnlike to a Potycaries pot which being filled with sweete oyntmentes or parfumes, doth reteyne in it selfe some sent of the same, and being powred out doth returne to the former state, hard, harshe, and of small sauour: So the minde being fraught with delightes, as long as it can kepe them secretly enclosed, may continually feede vppon the pleasaunt record thereof as the well willing and readie horse byteth on the brydle, but hauing once disclosed them to any other, strayghtway we loose the hidden treasure of the same, and are oppressed with sundry doubtfull opinions and dreadfull conceipts. And yet for a man to record vnto him selfe in the inward contemplation of his mynde the often remembrance of his late receiued ioyes, doth as it were ease the hart of burden, and ad vnto the mynd a fresh supplie of delight, yea and in verse principally (as I conceyue) a man may best contriue this way of comforte in him selfe. Therfore as I haue sayde F. I. swymming now in delightes did nothing but write such verse as might accumilate his ioyes, to the extremitie of pleasure, the which for that purpose he kept from mee, as one more desirous to seeme obscure and defectiue, than ouermuch to glory in his aduentures, especially for that in the end his hap was as heauie, as hitherto he had bene fortunate, amongst other I remembred one hapned vppon this occasion. The husband of the Lady Elynor bebeing all this while absent from hir, gan now retorne,  & kept Cut at home, with whom F. J. found meanes so to ensignuate himselfe, that familiaritie tooke deepe roote betwene them, and seldome but by stelth you could finde the one out of the others company. On a tyme the knight ryding on hunting desired F. J. to accompany him, the which he could not refuse to do, but like a lusty younker, readie at all assayes, apparrelled him selfe in greene, and about his neck a Bugle, pricking  & gallowping amongst the formost, according to the mannor of that countrie. And it chauced that the maried Knight thus gallowping lost his horn, which some deuines might haue interpreted to be but moulting, & that by Gods grace, he might haue a newe come vp againe shortly in steede of that. Wel, he came to F. J. requiring him to lend him his Beugle, for (sayd the Knight) I hard you not blowe this daye, and I would fayne encourage the houndes, if I had a horne. Quod F. J. although I haue not ben ouer lauishe of my comming hitherto. I woulde you shoulde not doubt but that I can tell howe to vse a horne well enough, and yet I may little do if I maye not lende you a horne, and therewithall tooke his Beugle from his necke, and lent it to the Knight, who making in vnto the houndes, gan assaye to rechate: but the horne was to hard for him to wynde, whereat F. J. tooke pleasure, and sayde to him selfe, blowe tyll thou breake that: I made thee one with in these fewe dayes, that thou wilt neuer cracke whiles thou liuest. And hereupon (before the fal of the Buck) deuised this Sonet following, which at his home comming he presented vnto his mistresse. G. T.  As some men say there is a kind of seed. Will grow to hornes if it be sowed thick: Wherwith I thought to trye if I could breed A brood of buddes, well sharped on the prick: And by good proofe of learned skill J found, (As on some speciall soyle all seedes best frame) So ielouse braynes doe breed the battle ground, That best of all might serue to beare the same. Then sought J foorth to find such supple soyle, And cald to mynd thy husband had a brayne, So that percase, by trauayll and by toyle, His fruitfull front might turne my seed to gayne: And as J groped ln that ground to sowe it, Start vp a horne, thy husband could not blow it. F. I. This Sonet treateth of a straung seede, but it tasteth most of Rye , which is more comon amongst me nowadays: wel let it passe amogst ye rest,  & he that liketh it not, turn ouer ye leaf to another, I dout not but in this register he may find some to content him, vnlesse he be to curious: and here I will surcease to rehearse any more of his verses, vntill I haue expressed how that his ioyes being now exalted to the highest degree, began to bend towardes declination. For now the vnhappy Secretary whom I haue before remembred, was returned from London, on who F. I. had no sooner cast his eyes, but immediatly he fel into a great passion of mynd, which might be compared vnto a feauer. This fruit grew of the good instructions that his Hope had planted in his mind, whereby I might take iust occasion to forwarn euery louer, how they suffer this venemous serpent ielousie to creepe into their conceipts: for surely, of all other diseases in loue, I suppose that to be vncurable, and would hold longer discourse therin, were it not that both this tale and the verses of F. J. himselfe hereafter to be recited, shalbe sufficient to speak for me in this behalf. The louer (as I say vpon the sodein) was drouen into such a malladie, as no meate might nourish his body, no delights please his minde, no remembrance of ioyes forepassed content him, nor any hope of the lyke to come might recomfort him: hereat (some vnto whom I haue imparted this tale) haue take occasion to discomend his faynting hart, yit surely the cause inwardly  & depely considered, I cannot so lightly condempne him, for an old saying is, that euery man can giue councell better than follow it: and needs must the conflicts of his thoughts be straunge, betwene the remembraunce of his forepassed pleasure, and the present sight of this monster whom before (for lack of like instruction) he had not so throughly marked and beheld. Well, such was the grief vnto him, that he became sickly and kept his chamber. The Ladies hauing receyued the newes therof, gan al at once lament his misfortun, and of common consent agreed to visit him: they marched thither in good equipage, I warrant you, and found F. J. lying vpon his bed languishing, who they all saluted generally, and sought to recomforte, but especially his Mistresse, hauing in hir hand a braunch of willow, wherewith shee defended hir from the whot ayre, ga thus say vnto him: Seruaunt (quod she) for that I suppose your mallady to proceede of none other cause but only slouthfulnesse, I haue brought this preaty rod to beate you a little: nothing doubting, but when you feele the smart of a twig or twayne, you will like a tractable yong scholler, pluck vp your quickned spirits,  & cast this drowsines apart. F. J. with a great sighe answered: Alas good Mistres (quod he) if any like chastisement might quicken me, how much more might the presence of all you louely Dames? recomfort my dulled mynd who to behold, were sufficient to reuiue an eye now dazled with the dread of death, and that not onely for the heauenly aspectes which you represent, but also much the more for your exceeding curtesie, in that you haue deigned to visit mee so vnworthy a seruaunt: But good Mistres (quod he) as it were shame for me to confesse that euer my hart could yeelde for feare, so I assure you that my minde cannot be content to induce infirmitie by sluggish conceyt: But in trueth Mistresse I am sicke (quod he), and there withall the trembling of his hart had sent vp such throbbing into his throte, as that his voyce (now depriued of breath) comaunded the tong to be still. When Dame Elynor for compassion distilled into teares, and drew towards the window, leauing the other Gentlewome about his bed, who beinge no lesse sory for his grief, yit for that they were none of them so touched in their secrete thoughtes, they had bolder sprits and freeer speech to recomfort him: amongest the rest the Lady Fraunces , (who in deede loued him deepely, and could best coniecture the cause of his coceipts) said vnto him: Good Trust (quod shee) if any helpe of Phisick may cure your maladie, I would not haue you hurt your selfe with these doubts which you seeme to retayne: If choice of Dyet may helpe, behold vs here (your cookes) ready to minister all things needfull: if company may dryue away your anoye, wee meane not to leaue you solitary: if grief of mynde be cause of your infirmitie, wee all here will offer our deuoyre to turne it into ioye: if mishap haue giuen you cause to feare or dreade any thing, remember Hope , which neuer fayleth to recomfort an afflicted mind. And good Trust (quod she) (distreining his hand right hartely) let this simple profe of our poore good willes be so accepted of you, as that it may work therby the effect of our desires. F. J. (as one in a traunce) had marked very litle of hir curteouse talke, and yet gaue hir thanks, and so held his peace: whereat the Ladies (being all amazed) there became a silence in the chamber on all sides. Dame Elynor fearing thereby that she might the more easely be espyed, and hauing nowe dryed vp hir teares, returned to F. I. recomforting him by al possible meanes of common curtesie, promising that since in hir sicknes he had not only stauched hir bleeding, but also by his gentle company and sundry deuices of honest pastime had dryue away the pensiuenes of hir mind, she thought hir selfe bound with like willingnes to do hir best in any thing that might restore his health? and taking him by the hand sayd further: Good seruaunt, if thou beare in deed any true affection to thy poore Mistres, start vpon thy feet agayn, and let hir enioye thyne accustomed seruice to hir comfort, for sure (quod shee) I will neuer leaue to visite this chamber once in a day, vntill I may haue thee down with mee. F. J. hearing the harty words of his Mistres, and perceyuing the earnest maner of hir pronunciation, began to receyue vnspeakable comfort in the same, and sayde. Mistres, your exceeding curtesie were able to reuiue a man half dead, and to me it is both great comfort, and it doth also gald my remembraunce with a continuall smart of myn own vnworthinesse: but as I would desire no longer lyfe, than til I might be able to deserue some part of your bounty, so I will endeuour my selfe to liue, were it but onely vnto that ende, that I might merit some part of your fauour with acceptable seruice, and requite some deale the courtesie of all these other faire Ladies, who haue so farre (aboue my desertes) deigned to do me good. Thus said, the Ladies tarried not long before they were called to Euensong, when his Mistres taking his hand, kissed it saying: Farewell good seruaunt, and I pray thee suffer not the malice of thy sicknesse to ouercome the gentlenes of thy good hart. F. J. rauished with ioy, suffered them all to depart, and was not able to pronounce one word. After their departure, hee gan cast in his mind the exceeding curtesie vsed towards him by them all: but aboue all other the bounty of his Mistresse, and therewithall tooke a sounde and firme opinion, that it was not possible for hir to couterfeit so deeply (as in deed I beleeue that she then did not) whereby he sodenly felt his hart greatly eased, and began in himselfe thus to reason. Was euer man of so wretched a harte? I am the most bounden to loue (quod he) of all them that euer professed his seruice, I enioy one the fayrest that euer was found, and I find hir the kindest that euer was heard of: yit in myne owne wicked hart I could villaynously conceiue that of hir, which being compared with the rest of hir vertues is not possible to harbour in so noble a mind. Hereby I haue brought my self without cause into this feeblenes, and good reason that for so high an offence I should be punished with great infirmitie: what shall I then doe? yeeld to the same? no, but according to my late protestation I will recomfort this languishing mind of myne, to the end I may liue but onely to doe penaunce for this so notable a crime so rashly committed: and thus saying, he start from his bed, and gan to walke towards the window: but the venimous serpent which (as before I rehearsed) had stong him, could not bee content that these medicines applied by the mouth of his gentle Mistresse, should so soone restore him to guerison. And although in deed they were such Mythrydat ae to F. J. as that they had nowe expelled the rancour of the poyson, yit that ougly hellish monster had left behinde hir in the most secret of his bosome, (euen betwene the mynd and the man) one of hir familiars named Suspect , which gan work in the weake sprites of F. J. efects of no lesse perill than before hee had conceyued: his head swelling with these troublesome toyes, and his hart swimming in the tempests of tossing fantasie: he felt his legges so feeble, that he was costrained to lye down on his bed again, and repeating in his own remembraunce euery woord that his Mistres had spoken vnto him, he gan to dreade, that she had brought the willow braunce to beate him with, in token that he was of hir forsaken: for so louers doe most commonly expound the willowe garland, and this to think, did cut his hart in twayne. A wonderfull chaunge: and here a little to stay you, I will discribe (for I think you haue not red it in Ariosto ) the beginning, the fall, the retourne, and the bying of this hellish byrd, who in deed may well be counted a very limbe of the Diuill. Many yeares since, one of the most dreadful dastards in the world, and one of them that first deuised to weare his beard at length, least the barbor might do him a good turne sooner than he looked for it, and yit not so soone as he deserued, had builded for his securitie a pile on the hyghest and most inaccessible mount of all his Territories: the which being fortified with strong walles, and enuironed with deepe ditches, had no place of entrie, but one onely doore so streight and narrow, as might by any possibility receiue the body of one liuing man, from which he ascended vp a ladder,  & so creeping thorough a maruelous strayt hole, attained to his lodging, ye which was so dark & obscure, as scarcely either sunne or ayre could enter into it: thus hee deuised to lodge in safetie, and for the more suertie gan trust none other letting downe this ladder but only his wife, and at the foote therof kept alwaies by day light, a firce mastif close enkeneled which neuer sawe nor heard the face or voyce of any other creature but onely of them two, him by night he trusted with the scout of this prety passage, hauing neuerthelesse betwene him and this dogge, a double doore with treble locks, quadriple barres: and before all a port coulez of Iron: neyther yit could he be so hardy as to sleep vntil he had caused a gard of seruauntes (whome hee kept abroade for that purpose) to searche all the corners adioyning to his fortresse, and then betwene fearfull sweate and chyuering cold, with one eye open and the other closed, he stole somtimes a broken sleepe, deuided with many terrible dreames. In this sort the wretch liued all to long, vntill at last his wife being not able any longer to supporte this hellish life, grew so hardy, as with his owne knife to dispatch his carkas out of this earthly purgatory: the which being done his soule (and good reason) was quickly conueyed by Carone vnto hell: there Radamanthus Iudge of that benche, commaunded him quickly to be thrust into a boyling poole: and being therein plonged very often, he neuer shriked or cryed, I skalde, as his other companions there cried, but seemed so lightly to esteeme it, that the Iudge thought meete to condempne him vnto the most terrible place, where are such torments, as neyther penne can write, tongue expresse, or thought conceyue: but the myser (euen there) seemed to smyle and to make small accompt of his punishment. Radamanthus hereof enformed sent for him, and demaunded the cause why he made so light of his durance? he aunswered that whyles he liued on earth, he was so continually afflicted and oppressed with suspicion, as that now (only to thinke that he was out of those meditacions) was sufficient armour to defend him from all other torments. Radamanthus astonied hereat, gan call togither the Senators of that kingdome, and propounded this question, how  & by what punishement they might deuise to touche him according to his deserts? and herupo fell great disputation, at last being cosidered that he had already bin plonged in the most vnspeakable torments, & therat litle or nothing had chaunged coutenace, therwithall yt no soule was sent vnto the to be relieued of his smart, but rather to be punished for his former delights: it was cocluded by ye general coucel, yt he shold be eftsones sent into ye world & restoored to the same body wherein he first had his resiance, so to remain for perpetuity, and neuer to depart nor to perish. Thus this body and soule being once againe vnited, and now eftsones with the same pestilence infected, hee became of a suspicious man Suspicion it selfe: and now the wretch remembring the treason of his wyfe, who had so willingly dispatched him once before, gan vtterly abhor hir and fled hir company, searching in all countries some place of better assurance: and when hee had in vayn trode on the most part of the earth, he embarked himself to find some vnknowen Iland wherein hee might frame some new habitacion, and finding none so commodious as hee desired, he fortuned (sayling along by the shoare) to espie a rock, more than sixe hundreth Cubits high, which hong so suspiciously ouer the seas, as though it would threaten to fall at euery little blast: this did Suspicion Imagine to be a fit foundacion whereon he might buyld his second Bower: hee forsooke his boate, and trauayled by land to espie what entrie or accesse might be made vnto ye same, and found from land no maner of entrie or accesse, vnlesse it were that some curteouse Byrd of the ayre would be Ambassadour, or conuey some Engins, as whilom the Eagle did carrie Ganymedes into heauen. He then returned to Seas, and approching neere to his rock, founde a small streame of fresh water issuing out of the same into the Seas: the which, although it were so little and so straight, as might vnethes receiue a boate of bignes to carry one liuing creature at once, yit in his conceipt hee thought it more large and spacious than that broad way called of our forefathers Via appia , or than that other named Flaminia: hee abandoned his bark, and putting of hys clothes, aduetured (for he was now assured not to drown) to wade and swim against the streame of this vnknown brooke, the which (a wondrous thing to tell, and skarcely to be beleeued) came down from the very top and height of this rock: and by the way he found six straight  & dangerous places, wher the water seemed to stay his course, passing vnder sixe straight and lowe bridges, and hard by euery of those places, a pyle raysed vp in manner of a Bulworke, the which were hollow, in such sort as lodginges and other places necessary might in them commodiously be deuised, by such one as coulde endure the hellishnes of the place. Passing by these hee attayned with much payne vnto the toppe of the Rocke, the which hee found hollowed as the rest, and farre more fit for his securitie, than otherwise apt for any comoditie. There gan suspicion determyne to nestle him selfe, and hauing now placed six chosen porters, to wit, ( Dread, Mistrust, Wrath, Desperation, Frensie, and Fury: ) at these six straunge Bulworks, he lodged him self in ye vij. al alone, for he trusted no companye, but euer mistrustinge that his wyfe should eftsones find him out, therein he shrieketh continually like to a shrich owle to keepe the watch waking, neuer content to sleepe by day or by night. But to be sure that he shoulde not ouersleepe him selfe, gan stuffe his couch with Porpentines quilles, to the ende that when heauy sleepe ouercame him, and he therby should be constrayned to charge his pallad with more heauie burden, those plumes might then pricke through and so awake him. His garments were steele vpon Iron, and that Iron vppon Iron, and Iron againe, and the more he was armed, the lesse he trusted to be out of daunger. He chopped and changed continually now this, now that, new keyes, new lockes, ditches newe skowred, and walles newly fortified, and thus alwayes vncontented liueth this wretched helhound Suspicion in this hellish dungion of habitation, from whence he neuer remoueth his foote, but only in the dead & silent nights, when he may be assured that all creatures (but him selfe) are whelmed in sound sleepe. And then with stealing steps he stalketh about the earth, enfecting, tormeting, and vexing al kinds of people with some part of his afflictions, but especially such as either do sit in chayre of greatest dignitie and estimation, or els such as haue atchiued some deere and rare emprise: Those aboue al others he contynually galdeth with fresh wouds of dread, least they might loose and forgo the roomes wherunto with such long trauayle and good happes they had atteyned, and by this meanes percase he had crept into the bosome of F. J. who (as is before declared) did earst swimme in the deepest seas of earthly delightes. Nowe then I must thinke it high time to retorne vnto him, who being now through feeblenes eftsones cast downe vppon his bed, gan cast in his inward meditations all thinges passed, and as one throughly puffed vp and filled with one peeuishe conceipt, could thinke vppon nothing elles, and yet accusing his owne giltie conscience to be infected with ielosie, did compyle this translation of Ariostoes xxxi. song as followeth.  As to be tyed, in lincks of worthy loue? What life so blist and happie might appere, As for to serue Cupid that God aboue? Jf that our mindes were not sometimes infect, With dread, with feare, with care, with cold suspect: With deepe dispayre, with furious frensie, Handmaydes to hir, whom we call iellosie. For eu'ry other sop of sower chaunce, Which louers tast amid their sweete delight: Encreaseth ioye, and doth their loue aduaunce, Jn pleasures place, to haue more perfect plight. The thirstie mouth thinkes water hath good taste, The hungrie iawes, are pleas'd, with ech repaste: Who hath not prou'd what dearth by warres doth growe, Cannot of peace the pleasaunt plenties knowe. And though with eye, we see not eu'ry ioye, Yet may the mind, full well support the same, An absent life long led in great anoye, When presence comes, doth turne from griefe to game, To serue without reward is thought great payne, But if dispayre do not therewith remayne, Jt may be borne, for right rewardes at last, Followe true seruice, though they come not fast. Disdaynes, repulses, finally eche yll, Eche smart, eche payne, of loue eche bitter tast, To thinke on them gan frame the louers will, To like eche ioye, the more that comes at last: But this infernall plague if once it toutche, Or venome once the louers mind with grutch, All feastes and ioyes that afterwardes befall, The louer compts them light or nought at all. This is that sore, this is that poysoned wound, The which to heale, nor salue, nor oyntments serue, Nor charme of wordes, nor Jmage can be found, Nor obseruance of starres can it preserue, Nor all the art of Magicke can preuayle, Which Zoroastes found for our auayle. Oh cruell plague, aboue all sorrowes smart, With desperate death thou sleast the louers hart. And me euen now, thy gall hath so enfect, As all the ioyes which euer louer found, And all good haps, that euer Troylus sect, Atchiued yet aboue the luckles ground: Can neuer sweeten once my mouth with mell, Nor bring my thoughts, againe in rest to dwell. Of thy mad moodes, and of naught elles J thinke, Jn such like seas, fayre Bradamant did sincke. F. I. This is the translation of Ariosto his xxxi. song, all but the last staffe, which seemeth as an allegory applied to the rest. It will please none but learned eares, hee was tyed to the inuention, troubled in mynd  &c. So I leaue it to your iudgment, and returne to F. J. who continued on his bed, vntill his bountifull Mistresse with the companie of the other curteous dames retorned after supper to his chamber, at their first entrie: Why how now seruat (quod dame Elynor ) we hoped to haue found you on foote? Mistresse quod F. J. I haue assayed my feete since your departure, but I find them yet vnable to suporte my heauy body, and therfore am constrayned as you see, to acquaint my selfe with these pyllowes. Seruaunt sayd she I am right sory therof, but since it is of necessitie to beare sicknesse, I will employ my deuoyre to allaye some parte of your paynes, and to refreshe your weary limbes with some comfortable matter: and therwithall calling hir handmayde, deliuered vnto hir a bounche of pretie little keyes, and whispering in hir eare, dispatched hir towards hir chamber. The mayde taried not long, but returned with a little Casket, the which hir Mistresse toke, opened and drew out of the same much fyne lynnen, amongst the which she toke a pillowbere very fyne and sweete, which although it were of it selfe as sweete as might be, being of long time kept in that odoriferous chest, yet did shee with damaske water (and that the best that might bee I warrant you) all to sprinckle it with hir owne handes, which in my conceipt might much amende the matter. Then calling for a fresh pyllowe, sent hir mayde to ayre the same, and at hir returne put on this, thus perfumed pillowbeare. In meane time also she had with hir owne hands attyred hir seruants head in a fayre wrought kerchif taken out of the same Casket, then layde him downe vppon this fresh and pleasaunt place, and pretely as it were in sporte, bedewed his temples with sweete water which she had ready in a casting bottle of Gold, kissing his cheeke and saying: Good seruaunt be whole, for I might not longe endure thus to attende thee, and yit the loue that I beare towards thee, cannot be content to see thee languish: Mistres sayd F. J. (and that with a trembling voyce) assure your self, that if there remayn in mee any sparke of lyfe or possibilitie of recouery, then may this excellent bountie of yours be sufficient to reuiue me without any further trauayle or payn vnto your persone, for whom I am highly to blame, in that I do not spare to put you vnto this trouble: and better it were that such a wretch as I had dyed vnknowen, than that by your exceding curtesie you should fall into any mallady, eyther by resorting vnto me, or by these your paynes taken about me. Seruaunt (quod she) all pleasures seeme paynefull to them that take no delight therin, and likewise all toyle seemeth pleasaunt to such as set their felicitie in the same, but for mee be you sure, I do it with so good a wyll that I can take no hurt therby, vnlesse I shall perceyue that it be reiected or neglected, as vnprofitable or vncomfortable vnto you. To me Mistresse quod F. J. it is such pleasure, as neither my feeble tongue can expresse, nor my troubled mind conceyue. Why? are you troubled in mynd then seruaunt quod dame Elynor? F.I now blushing answered, but euen as all sicke men be Mistresse. Herewith they staid their talke a while, and the first that brake silence was the Lady Fraunces , who sayde: and to driue away the troubles of your mynd good Trust , I wold be glad if we could deuise some pastime amongst vs to kepe you company, for I remember that with such deuises you did greatly recomfort this fayre Lady when shee languished in like sorte. She languished in deede gentle Hope , quod F. J. but God forbid that she had languished in like sort. Euery body thinketh their griefe greatest qd dame Elynor , but in deede whether my griefe were the more or the lesse, I am right sorie that youres is such as it is: And to assay whither our passions proceded of like cause or not, I would we could (according to this Ladies saying) deuise some like pastimes to trie if your malladie would be cured with like medicines. A gentlewoman of the company whom I haue not hitherto named, and that for good respects, least hir name might altogether disclose the rest, gan thus propound. We haue accustomed (quod she) heretofore in most of our games to chuse a Kyng or Queene, and he or she during their gouernement haue charged euery of vs eyther with commaundementes or questions as best seemed to their maiestie: wherein to speake mine opinion we haue giuen ouer large a skope, neyther seemeth it reasonable that one shoulde haue the power to discouer the thoughts, or at least to brydle the affects of all the rest. And though in deede in questioning (which doth of the twayne more nerely touche the mind) eueryone is at free libertie to aunswere what they list: yet oft haue I heard a question demaunded in such sorte, and vppon such sodayne, that it hath bene hardly answered without mouing matter of contention. And in commaundes also, sometimes it happeneth one to bee commaunded vnto such seruice, as eyther they are vnfit to accomplish (and then the parties weakenes is therby detected) or els to do something that they would not, wherof ensueth more grutch then game. Wherefore in myne opinion, we shall do well to chuse by lot amongst vs a gouernour, who for that it shalbe sufficient preheminence to vse the chayre of maiestie, shalbe boud to giue sentence vppon all such arguments and questions as we shall orderly propound vnto them, and from him or hir (as from an oracle) we will receiue aunswere, and decyding of our lytigious causes. This dame had stuffe in hir, an old courtier, and a wylie wench, whome for this discourse I will name Pergo , least hir name natural were to brode before, and might not drinke of all waters. Wel this proportion of Pergo pleased them wel, and by lot it happened that F. I. must be moderator of these matters, and collector of these causes: the which being so constituted, the Lady Elynor said vnto this dame Pergo . You haue deuised this pastime (qd she)  & because we thinke you to be most expert in the handling therof, do you propound the first question, & we shalbe both the more readye and able to followe your example: the Lady Pergo refused not, but began on this wise. Noble gouernor (qd she) amongst the aduentures that haue befallen me, I remember especially this one, that in youth it was my chaunce to be beloued of a very courtlike young gentleman, who abode neare the place wherin my parents had their resiaunce. This gentleman whether it were for beauty, or for any other respect that he sawe in me, I know not, but he was enamored of me,  & that with an exceding vehement passion, & of such force were his affects, that notwistading many repulses which he had receiued at my hands, he seemed dayly to growe in the renewing of his desires. I on the otherside, although I could by no meanes mislike of him by any good reason, considering that hee was of byrth no waye inferior vnto me, of possessions not to bee disdeyned, of parson right comely, of behauyour Courtly, of manners modest, of mynde lyberall, and of verteous disposition: yet such was the gaitie of my mynd, as that I coulde not be content to lend him ouer large thongs of my loue, but alwayes daungerously behaued my selfe towardes him, and in such sorte, as hee coulde neyther take comforte of myne aunsweres, nor yet once finde him selfe requited with one good looke for all his trauayle. This notwithstanding, the worthy Knight continued his sute wyth no lesse vehement affection than earst hee hadde be gone it, euen by the space of seuen yeares. At the last, whether discomfited by my dealinges, or tyred by long trauayle, or that he had percase light vppon the lake that is in the forrest of Ardena , and so in haste and all thristie, had dronke some droppes of disdayne, whereby his hot flames were quenched, or that he had vndertaken to serue no longer but his iust terme of apprenticehode, or that the teeth of time had gnawen and tyred his dulled sprites in such sorte, as that all beenommed hee was constrayned to vse some other artificial balme for the quickning of his sences, or by what cause moued I know not, he did not onely leaue his long continued sute, but (as I haue since perceyued) grew to hate me more deadly than before I had disdayned him. At the first beginning of his retyre I perceiued not his hatred, but imagined that being ouer wearied he had withdrawen him self for a time. And considring his worthynes, therwithall his constancie of long time proued, I thought that I could not in the whole world find out a fitter match to bestowe my selfe, than on so worthy a person, wherefore I did by all possible meanes procure that he might eftsones vse his accustomed repayre vnto my parents: And further, in all places where I happened to meete him, I vsed all the curtesies towardes him that might bee contayned within the bondes of modestie, but al was in vayne, for he was now become more daungerous to be wonne, than the haggard Faulcon. Our lottes being thus vnluckely chaunged, I grewe to burne in desire, and the more daungerous that he shewed him selfe vnto me, the more earnest I was by all meanes to procure his consent of loue. At the last I might perceiue that not onely he disdayned me, but as me thought boyled in hatred against me: and the time that I thus continued tormented with these thoughts, was also iust the space of seuen yeares. Finally when I perceiued no remedie for my parplexities, I assayed by absence to weare away this malladie, and therfore vtterly refused to come in his presence, yea or almost in any other company, whereby I haue consumed in lost time the flower of my youth, and am become as you see (what with yeares, and what with the tormeting passions of loue) pale, wan, and full of wrinkles, neuerthelesse, I haue therby gayned thus much, that at last I haue wond my self cleere out of Cupids cheines, and remain carelesse at libertie. Now marke to what end I tell you this: first vii. yeares passed in the which I could neuer be content to yeeld vnto his iust desires: next other vii. yeares I spent in seeking to recouer his lost loue: and sithens both those vii. yeares, there are euen now on saint Valentines day last, other vii. yeares passed, in the which (neither I haue desired to see him) nor he hath coueted to heare of me. My parents now perceiuing how the crowes foot is crept vnder myne eye, and remembring the long sute that this gentlema had in youth spent on me considering therewithall that greene youth is well mellowed in vs both, haue of late sought to perswade a marriage betwene vs, the which the Knight hath not refused to heare of, and I haue not disdained to thinke on: by their mediation we haue bin eftsoones brought to Parlee , wherein ouer and besides the ripping vp of many old griefes, this hath ben chiefly rehearsed  & obiected betwene vs, what wrong and iniury eche of vs hath done to other, and hereabouts wee haue fallen to sharpe contention: he alledged, that much greater is the wrong which I haue done vnto him, than that repulse which hee hath sithens vsed to me: and I haue affirmed the contrary, the matter yit hangeth in variance. Nowe, of you worthy Gouernour I would be most glad to heare this question decided, remembring that ther was no difference in the times betwene vs: and surely, vnles your iudgement helpe me, I am afraide my marriage wilbe marred, and I may goe lead Apes in hell. F. I. aunswered, good Pergo , I am sory to heare so lamentable a discourse of your luckles loue, and much the sorier, in that I must needes giue sentence against you: for surely great was the wrong that either of you haue done to other, and greater was the needelesse grief which causelesse eche of you hath conceiued in this long time, but greatest in my iudgement hath ben both the wrong and the grief of the Knight, in that notwithstanding his deserts (which your self confesse) he neuer enioyed any guerdone of loue at your handes: And you (as you alledge) did enioy his loue of long time togither, so that by the reckoning, it will fall out (although being blinded in your owne conceypt) you see it not, that of the one  & twenty yeares you enioyed his loue vii. at the least, but that euer he enioyed yours wee cannot perceiue. And much greater is the wrong that rewardeth euill for good, than that which requireth tip for tap: further, it seemed that where as you went about in time to trie him, you did altogither loose time which can neuer be recouered: and not onely lost your owne time, whereof you would seeme now to lament, but also compelled him to leese his time, which he might (be it spoken without offence to you) haue bestowed in some other worthy place, and therefore, as that grief is much greater which hath no kind of cofort to allay it, so much more is that wrong which altogither without cause is offered. And I (said Pergo ) must needes think, that much easier is it for them to endure grief which neuer tasted of ioy, and much lesse is that wrong which is so willingly profered to be by recompence restored: for if this Knight will confesse that he neuer had cause to reioice in all the time of his seruice, then with better cotentation might he abyde grief than I, who hauing tasted of the delight which I did secretly coceiue of his deserts, do think ech grief a present death by the remembrance of those forepassed thoughts:  & lesse wrong seemeth it to be destitut of ye thing which was neuer obteyned, than to be depriued of a iewell whereof we haue bin already possessed: so yt vnder your correction I might coclude, that greater hath bin my grief & iniury susteined, than that of the Knight. To whom F. J. replied, as touching delight, it may not be denied but that euery louer doth take delight in the inward cotemplation of his mind, to think of the worthines of his beloued,  & therfore you may not alledge that the Knight had neuer cause to reioice, vnlesse you will altogither codempne your self of vnworthines: Mary if you will say that he tasted not the delights that louers seeke, then mark, who was the cause but your self? And if you would accuse him of like ingratitude, for that he disdained you in the latter vii. yeres, whe as he might by accepting your loue, haue recopenced himself of all former wrongs you must remeber therwithal, that the crueltie by you shewed towards him was such, yt could by no meanes perceiue that your chauge proceeded of good will, but rather eftsones to hold him enchained in vnknown links of subtil dealings, & therfore not without cause he douted you: & yit without cause you reiected him. He had ofte sought occasion, but by your refusals he could neuer find him: you hauing occasio fast by the foretop did dally with him so long, til at last he slipped his head from you, & then catching at the bald noddle, you foud your self ye cause, & yit you would accuse another. To coclude, greater is the grief that is susteined without desert, and much more is the wrong that is offred without cause. Thus F. J. decided the question propounded by Pergo ,  & expected that some other Dame should propoud another: but his mistres (hauing hir hand on another halfpeny) gan thus say vnto him. Seruant this pastime is good, and such as I must needs like of, to driue away your pensiue thoughts: but sleeping time approcheth, & I feare we disquiet you, wherefore the rest of this time we will (if so like you) bestowe in trimming vp your bed and to morrow we shall meete here and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD5418&area=prose&forward=textsFT) nenew this new begon game with Madame Pergo . Mistres (qd F. J. ) I must obey your will, and most humbly thanke you of your great goodnesse, and all these Ladies for their curtesie: Euen so, requiring you that you will no further trouble your selues about me, but let my seruaunt alone with conducting me to bed. Yes seruaunt (quod she) I wil see if you can sleepe any better in my sheetes: and therewith commaunded hir handmayd to fetch a paire of cleane sheetes, the which beeing brought (maruailous fine and sweete) the Ladies Fraunces and Elynor did curteously vnfold them, and layd them on the bed, which done, they also entreated F. J. to vncloth him and go to bed: being layd, his Mistres dressed and couched the clothes about him, sithens moistened his temples with rosewater, gaue him handkerchewes and other fresh linnen about him, in dooing wherof, she whispered in his eare, saying: Seruaunt, this night I will bee with thee, and after with the rest of the Dames gaue him good night and departed, leauing F. J. in a traunce betwene hope and dispayre, trust and mistrust. Thus he lay rauished, commaunding his seruaunt to goe to bed, and fayning that himself would assay if he could sleepe. About ten or eleaue of the clock came his Mistresse in hir night gowne, who knowing all priuy wayes in that house very perfectly, had conueied hir self into F. I. chamber, vnseene and vnperceyued, and being nowe come vnto his beds side kneeled down, and laying hir arme ouer him sayed these or like wordes: My good Seruaunt, if thou knewest what perplexiteis I suffer in beholding of thine infirmities, it might then suffise, eyther vtterly to dryue away thy mallady, or much more to augment thy griefs: for I know thou louest me, and I think also that thou hast had sufficient profe of myne vnfained good will, in remembrance whereof, I fall into sundry passions: First, I compt the happy lots of our first acquaintance, and therin I call to mynde the equalitie of our affections, for I think that there were neuer two louers conioyned with freeer consent on both parties: and if my ouerhasty deliuery of yeelding words be not wrested hereafter to my condempnacion, I can then assure my self to escape for euer without desert of any reprofe: herewithall I can not forget the sundry aduentures happened since we became one hart deuided in two bodies, all which haue ben both happily atchieued, and delectably enioyed: what resteth then to consider but this thy present state? The first corosiue that I haue felt, and the last cordiall that I looke for, the end of my ioyes, and the beginning of my torments, and hereat hir salt teares gan bathe the dying lips of hir seruaunt: who hearing these wordes, and well considering hir demeanor, began now to accuse him selfe of such and so haynous treason, as that his gilty harte was constreined to yeelde vnto a iust scourge for the same. Hee swooned vnder hir arme: the which when she perceyued, it were hard to tel what feares did most affright hir. But I haue heard my friend F. I. cofesse, that he was in a happy traunce, and thought himself for diuers causes vnhappely reuiued. For surely I haue heard him affirme, that to dye in such a passion had ben rather pleasant, than like to panges of death. It were hard now to rehearse how hee was reuiued, since there wer none present, but he dying, (who could not declare)  & she liuing, who wold not disclose so much as I meane to bewray. For my fried F. J. hath to me emported, that returning to life, the first thing which he felt, was that his good mistres lay pressing his brest wt the whole weight of hir body, and biting his lips with hir friendly teeth: and peraduenture shee refrayned (either of curtesie towards him, or for womanish feare, to hurt hir tender hand) to strik him on the cheekes in such sorte, as they doe that striue to call agayne a dying creature: and therefore thought this the aptest meane to reduce him vnto remembrance. F. I. now awaked, could no lesse do, than of his curteous nature receyue his Mistresse into his bed: Who, as one that knew that waye better, than how to help his swooning, gan gently strip of hir clothes, and louingly embracing him, gan demaund of him in this sorte. Alas good Seruaunt (quod she) what kinde of maladie is this that so extreemely doth torment thee? F. J. with faynting speech aunswered: Mistresse as for my maladie, it hath ben easely cured by your bountifull medicines applied: But I must confesse, that in receiuing that guerison at your handes, I haue ben constreined to fall into an Extasie, through the galding remembrance of myne own vnworthines: Neuerthelesse good Mistresse, since I perceiue such fidelitie remayning betwene vs, as that fewe wordes will perswade such trust as louers ought to embrace, let these fewe wordes suffise to craue your pardon, and doe eftsoones powre vpon me your vnworthy seruaunt) the haboundant waues of your accustomed clemency: for I must confesse, that I haue so highly offended you, as (but your goodnesse surpasse the malice of my conceipts) I must remayne (and that right woorthely) to the seuere punishment of my desertes: and so should you but loose him who hath cast away him self, and neither can accuse you, nor dare excuse him selfe of the crime. Dame Elynor , who had rather haue found hir seruaunt perfectly reuiued, than thus with straunge conceipts encombred: and musing much at his darke speech, became importunat to know ye certainty of his thoughts. And F. I. as one not maister of him selfe, gan at the last playnly confesse howe he had mistrusted the chaunge of hir vowed affections: Yea and (that more was) he playnly expressed with whom, of whom, by whom, and too whom shee bent hir better liking. Now, here I would demaund of you and such other as are expert: Is there any geater impediment to the fruition of a Louers delights, than to be mistrusted? or rather, is it not the ready way to race all loue and former good will out of remembrance, to tell a gilty mynd that you doe mistrust it? It should seeme yes, by Dame Elynor , who began nowe to take the matter whottely, and of such vehemency were hir fancies, that shee nowe fell into flat defiance with F. I. who although hee sought by many faire wordes to temper hir chollerike passions, and by yeelding him selfe to get the conquest of an other, yet could hee by no meanes determine the quarrell. The softe pillowes being present at all these whot wordes, put forth themselues as mediatours for a truce betwene these enemies, and desired that (if they would needes fight) it might be in their presence but onely one pusshe of the pike, and so from thenceforth to become friends again for euer. But the Dame denied flatly, alleadging that shee found no cause at all to vse such curtesie vnto such a recreant, adding further many wordes of great reproche: the which did so [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD5418&area=prose&forward=textsFT) encourage F. J. as that hauing now forgotten all former curtesies, he drewe vppon his new professed enimie, and bare hir vp with such a violence against the bolster, that before shee could prepare the warde, he thrust hir through both hands, and  &c. wherby the Dame swoning for feare, was constreyned (for a time) to abandon hir body to the enemies curtesie. At last when shee came to hir selfe, shee rose sodeinly and determined to saue hir selfe by flight, leauing F. J. with many dispytefull wordes, and swearing that hee should neuer (eftsoones) take hir at the like aduatage, the which othe she kept better than hir former professed good will: and hauing nowe recouered hir chamber (bicause shee founde hir hurt to be nothing daungerous) I doubt not, but shee slept quietly the rest of the night: As F. J. also perswading himselfe that hee should with conuenient leysure recouer hir from this hagger conceipt, tooke some better rest towardes the morning, than hee had done in many nights forepast. So let them both sleepe whyles I turne my penne vnto the before named Secretary , who being (as I sayd) come lately from London, had made many proffers to renew his accustomed consultations: but the sorrow which his Mistresse had conceyued in F. I. his sicknesse, togither with hir continuall repayre to him during the same, had ben such lettes vnto his attempts, at is was long time before he could obtayne audience. At the last these newe accidentes fell so fauourably for the furtherance of his cause, that he came to his Mistresse presence, and there pleaded for himselfe. Nowe, if I should at large write his allegations, togither with hir subtile aunsweres, I should but comber your eares with vnpleasaunt rehearsall of feminine frayeltie. To be short, the late disdayneful moode which she had coceyued against F. J. togither with a scrupule which lay in hir coscience, touching the xi. article of hir beleeue, moued hir presently with better will to cosult with this Secretary , aswel vpon a speedy reueng of hir late receiued wrogs as also vpon the reformation of hir religion. And in very deed, it fell out that the Secretary hauing bin of long time abset,  & therby his quils & penes not worn so neer as they were wont to be, did now prick such faire large notes, yt his Mistres liked better to sing faburden vnder him, tha to descant any longer vppon F. J. playne song: and thus they continued in good accorde, vntill it fortuned that Dame Fraunces came into hir chamber vppon such sodeyn as shee had like to haue marred all the musick. Wel thei coueied their clifs as closely as they could, but yit not altogither wtout some suspicio giuen to ye said dame Frauces , who although shee could haue bin content to take any payn in F. J. behalf, yit otherwise she would neuer haue bestowed the watching about so wortheles a prise. After womaly salutacions they fel into sundry discourses, ye Secretary stil abyding in ye chaber with them. At last two or three other gentlewome of the Castle came into Madam Elynors chamber, who after their Bon iour did all ( vna voce ) seeme to lament the sicknes of F. J. and called vpon the Dames Elinor and Fraunces , to go visite him againe. The Lady Fraunces curteously consented, but Madame Elinor first alledged that she hir selfe was also sickly, the which she attributed to hir late paynes taken about F. J. and sayd that onely for that cause she was constrayned to kepe hir bed longer than hir accustomed hower. The Dames (but especially the Lady Fraunces ) gan streight waies coniecture some great cause of sodaine change, and so leauing dame Elynor , walked altogether into the parke to take the ayre of the morning: And as they thus walked it chauced that Dame Pergo heard a Cuckoe chaunt, who (because the pride of the spring was now past) cried Cuck cuck Cuckoe in hir stameringe voyce. Aha (quod Pergo ) this foule byrd begines to flye the countrie, and yet before hir departure, see how spitefully she can deuise to salute vs. Not vs (quod Dame Fraunces ) but some other whom she hath espyed: wherewith Dame Pergo looking round about hir, and espying none other company sayd. Why here is no body but we few wome qd she. Thanks be to God the house is not farre from vs (quod Dame Fraunces .) Here at the wylie Pergo partely perceyuing Dame Fraunces meaning replyed on this sort: I vnderstand you not (quod she) but to leape out of this matter, shall we go visite Maister F. I. and see how he doth this morning? Why quod dame Fraunces , do you suppose that the Cuckoe called vnto him? Nay marry quod Pergo , for (as farre as I know) he is not maried. As who should say (quod Dame Fraunces ,) that the Cuckoe enuieth none but maryed folkes. I take it so sayd Pergo: the Lady Fraunces aunswered. Yes sure I haue noted as euill lucke in loue (after the cuckoes call) to haue happened vnto diuers vnmaried folkes, as euer I did vnto the maried: but I can be well content that we go vnto Master J. for I promised on the behalfe of vs al, that we wold vse our best deuoyre to recomfort him vntill he had recouered health, and I do much meruayle that ye Lady Elinor is now become so vnwilling to take any trauayle in his behalfe, especially remembring that but yesternight she was so diligent to bring him to bed, but I perceyue that all earthly thinges are subiect vnto change. Euen so they be quod Pergo , for you may behold the trees which but euen this other daye were clad in gladsome greene, and now their leaues begin to fade and change colour. Thus they passed talking and walking vntill they returned vnto the Castle, whereas they went straight vnto F. J. chamber,  & found him in bed: why how now Trust (quod Dame Fraunces ,) will it be no better? Yes shortly I hope quod F. J. The Ladies all saluted him  & he gaue them the gramercy: at the last Pergo popped this question vnto him. And howe haue you slept in your Mistres sheetes Master F. J. quod she? reasonable well quod F. J. but I pray you where is my Mistresse this morning? Mary sayd Pergo , wee left hir in bed scarce well at ease. I am the more sorye quod F. I. Why Trust (sayd Mistresse Fraunces ) be of good comforte, and assure your selfe that here are others who would be as glad of your wel doing, as your Mistresse in any respect. I ought not to doubt therof (quod F. J. ) hauing the proofe that I haue had of your great curtesies, but I thought it my dutie to aske for my Mistresse being absent. Thus they passed some time with him vntill they were called away vnto prayers, and that being finished they went to dinner, where they met Dame Elynor attired in a night kerchief after the soolenest (the solempnest fashion I should haue sayed,) who loked very drowsely vpon all folkes vnlesse it were hir secretary, vnto whom she deigned sometime to lend a freendly glaunce. The Lord of the Castle demaunded of hir howe F. J. did this morning. She answered that she knew not, for she had not seene him that day. You may do wel then daughter (qd the Lord) to go now vnto him,  & to assay if he wil eate any thing, & if here be no meates that like him, I pray you commaund (for him) any thing that is in my house. You must pardon me sir (quod she,) I am sickly disposed, and would be loth to take the ayre: why then go you Mistres Fraunces (quod he) and take some body with you: and I charge you see that he lacke nothing. Mistresse Fraunces was glad of the ambassade,  & arysing from the table with one other gentlewoman, toke with hir a dishe of chickins boyled in white broth, saying to hir father: I thinke this meate meetest for Master J. of any that is here. It is so (quod he) daughter, and if he like not that, cause somewhat els to be dressed for him according to his apetite. Thus she departed and came to F. J. who being plonged in sundry woes and thrilled with restlesse thoughtes, was now beginning to aryse: but seing the Dames, couched downe againe, and sayd vnto them. Alas fayre Ladies you put your selues to more paynes than eyther I do desire, or can deserue. Good Trust quod Dame Fraunces , our paines are no greater than dutie requireth, nor yet so great as we could vouchsafe in your behalfe, and presently my father hath sent vs vnto you quod she with this pittaunce, and if your apetite desire any one thing more than other, wee are to desire likewise that you will not refrayne to call for it. Oh my good Hope quod hee I perceiue that I shall not dye as longe as you maye make mee liue. And being nowe some deale recomforted with the remembraunce of his Mistres words which shee hadde vsed ouer night at hir first comming, and also thinkinge that although shee parted in choller, it was but iustly prouoked by him selfe, and that at leasure hee shoulde fynde some salue for that soore also: hee determyned to take the comforte of his assured Hope , and so to expell all venomnes of mistrust before receyued: wherfore raysing him selfe in his bed, he cast a night gowne about his shoulders saying: It shall neuer be sayd that my faynting hart can reiect the comfortable Cordialles of so freendly phisitions. Nowe by my troth well sayed gentle Trust quod Dame Fraunces , and in so doing assure your selfe of guerison with speed. This thus sayed, the curteous Dame became his keruer,  & hee with a bold spirite gan tast of hir cookery, but the late conflicts of his conceipts had so disaquainted his stomack from repastes, that he could not well away with meate: and yet neuerthelesse by little & little receyued some nouryture. When his Hope had crammed him as long as she coulde make him feede, they deliuered the rest to the other gentlewoman, who hauing not dyned, fell to hir prouander. In which meane while the Lady Fraunces had much cofortable speech with F. J. and declared that she perceyued very well the cause of his malladie, but my Trust (quod she) be all whole, and remember what I foretold you in the beginning: neuerthelesse you must thinke that there are remedies for all mischiefes, and if you wilbe ruled by myne aduise, we will soone find the meane to ease you of this mishap. F. J. toke comforte in hir discretion, and freendly kissing hir hand, gaue hir a cartlode of thankes for hir great good will, promising to put to his vttermost force, and euermore to be ruled by hir aduise. Thus they passed the dynner while, the Ladie Fraunces alwayes refusing to declare hir conceipt of the late change which she perceyued in his Mistresse, for shee thought best first to wynne his will vnto conformitie by little and little, and then in the end to persuade him with necessitie. When the other gentlewoman had vytayled hir, they departed, requiring F. J. to arise and boldly to resist the fayntnesse of his feuer, the which he promised and so bad them a Dio . The Ladyes at their returne found the courte in Dame Elynors chamber, who had there assembled hir secretary, Dam Pergo , and the rest: there they passed an hower or twayne in sundry discourses, wherin Dame Pergo did alwaies cast out some bone for Mistresse Fraunces to gnaw vppon, for that in deede she perceyued hir harty affection towardes F. I: whereat Mistresse Fraunces changed no countenaunce, but reserued hir reuenge vntill a better oportunitie. At last (quod Dame Fraunces vnto Mistresse Elinor ) and when will you go vnto your seruaunt fayre Lady? When he is sicke and I am whole quod Dame Elynor . That is euen now quod the other, for how sicke hee is your self can witnesse: and how well you are we must beare record. You may aswel be deceiued in my disposition (quod Dame Elynor ) as I was ouerseene in his sodain alteration, and if he be sicke you are meetest to be his phisition: for you sawe yesterday that my paines did little profite towardes his recofort. Yes surely sayd the other, not onely I but all the rest had occasio to iudge that your curtesie was his chiefe comfort. Well quod Dame Elinor you know not what I know. Nor you what I think quod Dame Fraunces . Thinke what you list quod Elynor . In deede quod Fraunces I may not thinke that you care, neither will I die for your [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=40010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFCD5418&area=prose&forward=textsFT) pleasure: and so halfe angry shee departed. At supper they met againe, and the Maister of the house demauded of his daughter Fraunces how F. J. did? Sir (quod she) he did eate somewhat at dinner, and sithens I saw him not. The more to blame quod he, and now I would haue al you gentlewomen take of the best meates and go suppe with him: for company driueth away carefulnesse, and leaue you me here with your leauinges alone. Nay sir quod Mistresse Elynor , I pray you giue me leaue to beare you company, for I dare not aduenture thither. The Lord of the Castle was contented  & dispatched away the rest: who taking with them such vyandes as they thought meetest, went vnto F. I. chamber, fynding him vp, and walking about to recouer strength, whereat Dame Fraunces reioysed, and declared how hir father had sent that company to attend him at supper. F. J. gaue great thankes, and missing now nothing but his Mistresse, thought not good yet to aske for hir, but because he partly gessed the cause of hir absence, he contented him selfe, hoping that when his lure was newe garnished, he shoulde easely reclayme hir from those coye conceiptes. They passed ouer their supper all in quiet, and sone after Mistresse Fraunces , being desirous to requite Dame Pergoes quippes, requested that they might continue the pastime which Dame Pergo had begon ouer night: whereunto they all consented, and the lot fell vnto Dame Fraunces to propounde the second question, who adressing hir speeche vnto F. J. sayde in this wyse. Noble gouernor, I will reherse vnto you a strauge historie, not fayned, neither borowed out of any olde aucthoritie, but a thing done in deede of late daies, and not farre distant from this place where wee nowe remayne. It chaunced that a gentleman our neighbour being maried to a very fayre gentlewoman, liued with hir by the space of fower or fiue yeares in great contentation, trusting hir no lesse than he loued hir, and yet louing hir as much as any man coulde loue a woman. On that otherside the gentlewoman hadde woon (vnto hir beautie) a singular commendation for hir chast and modest behauiour. Yet it happened in time that a lustie younge gentleman (who very often resorted to them) obtayned that at hir handes, which neuer any man coulde before him attayne: and to be playne, he woon so much in hir affections, that forgetting both hir owne dutie and hir husbandes kindnes, she yeelded hir body at the commaundement of this louer, in which pastime they passed long time by their polliticke gouernement. At last the friendes of this Lady (and especially three sisters which she had) espied ouermuch familiaritie betwene the two louers, and dreading least it might breake out to their comon reproch toke their sister apart, and declared that the worlde did iudge scarce well of the repayre of that gentleman vnto hir house: and that if she did not foresee it in time, she shoulde not onely leese the good credite which she hir selfe had hitherto possessed, but furthermore should distayne their whole race with common obloquy and reproch. These and sundry other godly admonitions of these sisters could not sinke in the mind of this gentlewoman, for she did not onely stand in defiaunce what any man coulde thinke of hir, but also seemed to accuse them, that because they saw hir estimation (being their yonger) to growe aboue their owne, they had therfore deuised this meane to set variance betwene hir husbande and hir. The sisters seeing their holesome counsell so reiected, and hir continue still in hir obstinate opinion, adressed their speech vnto hir husbande, declaring that the worlde iudged not the best, neyther they themselues did very wel like of the familiaritie betwene their sister and that gentleman, and therfore aduised him to forecast all perils, and in time to forbid him his house. The husband (on that otherside) had also conceyued such a good opinion of his gest,  & had growen into such a stricte famyliaritie with him, yt you might with more ease haue remoued a stone wall, than once to make him thinke amisse, eyther of his wyfe, or of hir louer: Yea and immediately after this conference he would not sticke thus to say vnto his wyfe. Besse: (for so in deede was hir name) thou hast three such busie brayned sisters, as I thincke shortly their heads will breake: they woulde haue me to bee iellous of thee, no no Besse &c. so that hee was not onely farre from any such beliefe, but furthermore dyd euery day encrease his curtesies towardes the louer. The sisters being thus on all sides reiected, and yet perceiuing more and more an vnseemely behauiour betwene their sister and hir minio, began to melt in their owne grease: and such was their enraged pretece of reuenge, that they suborned diuers seruants in the house to watch so dilligently, as that this treason might be discouered. Amogst the rest, one mayde of subtill spirite had so long watched them, that at last she espied them go into a chamber together, and locke the doore to them: whereuppon she ranne with all hast possible to hir Maister, and tolde him that if he would come with hir, shee woulde shewe him a very straunge sight. The gentleman (suspectinge nothinge) went with hir vntill he came into a chamber neare vnto that wherein they had shut themselues, and she poynting hir Maister to the keyhole, bad him looke through, where he sawe the thing which most might mislike him to behold. Where at he sodaynely drewe his Dagger, and turned towardes the mayde, who fled from him for feare of mischiefe: but when he could not ouertake hir in the heat of his choller, he commaunded that she should forthwith trusse vp that little which she had and to depart his seruice: and before hir departure he found meanes to talke with hir, threatening that if euer she spake any word of this mystery in any place where she should come, it shuld cost hir lyfe. The mayde for feare departed in silence, and the Master neuer changed coutenance eyther to his wife or to hir peramour, but feyned vnto his wyfe that he had turned away the mayde vppon that sodaine, for that shee had throwen a Kitchin knife at him, whyles he went about to correct a fault in hir &c. Thus the good gentleman dranke vp his owne swette vnseene euery day, encreasing curtesie to the louer, and neuer chaunging countenaunce to his wyfe in any thing, but onely that he refrayned to haue such knowlege of hir carnally as he in times past had, and other men haue of their wyues. In this sort he continued by the space all most of halfe a yeare, neuerthelesse lamenting his mishap in sollitary places. At last (what moued him I know not) he fell agayn to company with his wife as other men doo, and as I haue heard it saied he vsed this pollicy: euery time that he had knowledge of hir, he would leaue either in the bed, or in hir cusshencloth, or by hir looking glasse, or in some place wher shee must needes find it, a piece of mony which then was fallen to three halfpence: and I remember they called the Slippes. Thus he dealt with hir continually by the space of foure or fiue monethes, vsing hir neuerthelesse very kindly in all other respectes, & prouiding for hir al things necessary at the first call: But vnto his geast he still augmented his curtesie, in suche sorte, that you would haue thought them to be sworne brothers. Al this notwithstading his wife much musing at these three half peny peeces which she founde in this sorte, and furthermore, hauing sundry times found hir husband in solitarie places making great lamentation, she grew enquisitiue, what should be the secret cause of these alterations: vnto who he would none otherwise answere, but that any ma shuld finde occasion to be more pensiue at one time than at another. The wife notwithstanding encreasing hir suspect, emported the same vnto hir louer, alledging therwithall that shee doubted very much least hir husband had some vehement suspicio of their affaires. The louer encoraged hir, & likewise declared, yt if she would be importunate to enquire the cause, hir husband would not be able to keepe it from hir: and hauing now throughly enstructed hir, she dealt with hir husband in this sorte. One day when shee knew him to be in his study alone, she came in to him, and hauing fast locked the dore after hir, and coueyed the key into hir pocked, she began first with earnest entreaty, and then with teares to craue that he would no longer keepe from hir the cause of his sodein alteration. The husband dissimuled the matter still: at last she was so earnest to know for what cause he left money in such sort at sundry times, that he aunswered on this wise: Wyfe (quod he) thou knowest how long we haue ben maried togither, & how long I made so deare accompt of thee as euer man made of his wife: since which dayes, thou knowest also how long I refreyned thy company, and how long again I haue vsed thy company leauing the mony in this sorte, and the cause is this. So log as thou didst behaue thy self faithfully towards me, I neuer lothed thy company, but sithens I haue perceiued thee to be a harlot, & therfore did I for a time refreine and forbeare to lie with thee: & now I can no longer forbeare it, I do giue thee euery time that I lye with thee a slip, which is to make thee vnderstande thine own whordome: and this reward is sufficient for a whore. The wife began stoutly to stand at defiance, but the husband cut off hir speeche and declared when, where, and how he had seene it: hereat the woma being abashed, and finding hir conscience gilty of asmuch as he had alledged, fel down on hir knees, & with most bitter teares craued pardon, confessing hir offence: whereat hir husband (moued with pitie) & melting likewise in fluds of lamentation, recoforted hir promising that if from that day forwards she would be true vnto him, he wold not only forgiue al that was past, but become more tender & louing vnto hir than euer he was. What do I tary so long? they became of accord: & in full accoplishment therof, the gentlewoman did altogither eschew the company, the speech, & (as much as in hir lay) the sight of hir louer, although hir husband did continue his curtesie towars him, and often charged his wife to make him fair semblant. The Louer was now onely left in perplexitie, who knewe nothing what might be the cause of all these chaunges, & that most greeued him, he could by no meanes obteyne agayn the speech of his desired: hee watched all opportunities, hee suborned messangers, he wrote letters, but all in vayne. In the end shee caused to be declared vnto him a time and place where she would meete him and speake with him. Being mett, she put him in remembrance of all that had passed betwene them: shhe layed also before him howe trusty shee had bin vnto him in all professions: she confessed also how faithfully hee had discharged the dutie of a friend in all respects, and therewithall she declared that hir late alteration and pensiuenes of mind was not without great cause, for that she had of late such a mishap, as might change the disposition of any liuing creature: Yea and that the case was such, as vnlesse she found present remedy, hir death must needes ensue and that speedely: for the preuenting whereof, she alledged that she had beaten hir braynes with all deuises possible, and that in the end she could think of no redresse but one, the which lay only in him to accomplishe. Wherfore she besought him for all the loue and good will which passed betwene them, nowe to shew the fruites of true friendship, and to gratifie hir with a free graunt to this request. The louer who had always ben desirous to pleasure hir in any thing, but now especially to recouer hir woonted kindnesse, gan frankly promise to accoplish any thing that might be to him possible, yea though it were to his great detriment: and therewithall did deepely blame hir in that she would so long torment hir selfe with any grief, considering that it lay in him to helpe it. The Lady aunswered, that she had so long kept it from his knowledge, bycause she doubted whether he would be contented to performe it or not, althogh it was such a thing as he might easely graut without any maner of hurt to himself: & yit that now in ye end she was forced to adueture vpon his curtesie, being no loger able to bear ye burde of hir grief the louer solicited hir most earnestly to disclose it: and she (as fast) seemed to mistrust yt he would not accoplish it. In the end she tooke out a booke (which shee had brought for the nonce) and bound him by oth to accoplish it. The louer mistrusting nothing lesse than that ensued, tooke the othe willingly: which don she declared al that had passed betwene hir & hir husband: his grief, hir repentance, his pardon, hir vow, & in ye ende of hir tale enioined the louer, that fro thenceforthwards, he should neuer attempt to break hir costant determination: the louer replied that this was vnpossible: but shee plainly assured him, yt if he grauted hir that request, she would be his friend in all honest & godly wise: if not, shee put him out of doubt that she would eschew his copany & flie from his sight as from a scorpion. The louer considering that hir request was but iust, accusing his own gilty conscience, remembring the great curtesies always vsed by hir husband, & therwithal seeing the case now brought to such an issue, as yt by none other meanes than by this it could be coceiled fro knowledge of the world: but most of all, being vrged by his oth, did at last giue an vnwilling consent, & yit a faithful promise to yeeld vnto hir wil in al things: and thus being become of one asset, he remaineth the dearest friend & most welcome gest that may be, both to the Lady & hir husband, and the man & wife so kind (ech to other) as if there neuer had bin such a breache betwene them. Now, of you noble Gouernor I would fayn learn, whether the perplexitie of the husband when he looked in at the key hole, or of the wife when she knewe the cause why the slippes were so scattered, or of the louer when he knew what was his Mistres charge, was greater of the three? I might haue put in also the troubled thoughts of the sisters & the mayd, when they sawe their good will reiected, but let these three suffise. Gentle Hope (quod F. J. ) you haue rehearsed ( & that right eloquetly) a notable tale, or rather a notable history, bycause you seeme to affirme, that it was don in deed of late, & not far hence. Wherein I note fiue especiall pointes: that is a maruelous pacience in the husband, no lesse repentance in the wyfe, no small boldnesse of the mayd, but much more rashnesse in the sisters, and last of all, a rare tractabilitie in the louer. Neuerthelesse to returne vnto your question, I think the husbands perplexitie greatest, bicause his losses abounded aboue the rest, & his iniuries were vncoparable. The Lady Fraunces did not seeme to contrary him, but rather smyled in hir sleeue at Dame Pergo , who had no lesse patience to heare the tale recited, than the Lady Frauces had pleasure in telling of it, but I may not rehearse the cause why, vnlesse I shuld tell all. By this time the sleeping houre aproched,  & the Ladies prepared their departure, when as mistres Frauces said vnto F. J. Although percase I shal not do it so handsomly as your mistres, yit good Trust (quod she) if you vouchsafe it, I can be content to trim vp your bed in ye best maner that I may, as one who would be as glad as she to procure your quiet rest. J. F. gaue hir gret thaks desiring hir not to trouble hirself, but to let his ma alone with that charge: thus they departed, and how all parties tooke rest that night I know not: but in the morning F. I. began to cosider wt himself that he might lye long enough in his bed before his mistres would be apeased in hir peewish coceipts: wherfore he arose,  & being aparelled in his night gown, tooke occasion to walk in the gallery neer adioyning vnto his Mistres chaber: but ther might he walk long enough ere his mistres would come to walk wt him. When dinner time came he wet into the great chamber wheras the Lord of the castle saluted him being ioyful of his recouery. F. J. giuing dewe thanks, declared that his frendly entretainemet togither with the great curtesie of the gentlewome was such, as might reuiue a ma althogh he were half dead. I would be loth (qd the hoste) that any gentlema coming to me for good wil shuld want any curtesie of entertainmet yt lieth in my power. Whe ye meat was serued to the table, the gentlewome came in all but Dame Elynor & mistres Pergo , the which F. J. marked very well,  & it did somewhat abate his apetit. After dinner, his Hope came vnto him and demaunded of him howe hee would passe the day for his recreation? to whom he aunswered euen as it best pleased hir. She deuised to walke into the park,  & so by little & litle to acquaint himself with the ayre: he agreed, & they walked togither being accopanied with one or two other gentlewome. Here (least you shuld grow in some wrong coceit of F. J. ) I must put you out of dout, that although ther were now more cause that he shuld mistrust his mistres than euer he had before receiued, yit the vehemet passions which he saw in hir whe she first came to visit him,  & moreouer, the earnest words which she pronouced in his extremity, were such a refreshing to his mind, as that he determined no more to trouble himself wt like coceitps: cocluding further, yt if his mistres wer not faulty, the had he comitted a foule offece in needlesse ielousie, & that if she were faulty (especially with the Secretary ) the no persuasion could amend hir, nor any passion help him: and this was the cause yt enabled him after such passing pangs to abyde the doubtfull conclusion, thus manfully and valiatly to represse feintnesse of his mind: nothing doubting but that he should haue wonne his Mistres to pardon his presumption,  & louingly to embrace his seruice in wonted maner, but he was far deceyued, for she was now in another tewne, the which Mistres Frauces began partly to discouer vnto him as they walked togither: for shee burdened him that his mallady proceeded only of a disquiet mind. And if it did so my gentle Hope (quod he) what remedy? My good Trust (quod she) none other but to plant quiet where disquiet began to grow. I haue determined so (qd he) but I must craue the helpe of your assured friedship. Therof you may make accoupt (qd she) but wherin? F. I. walking apart with hir, bega to declare that ther was some contetion hapened betwene his mistres  & him: the Lady told him that she was not ignorant therof. The he desired hir to treat so much in yt cause, as they might eftsones come to Parlee: therof I dare assure you (qd Mistresse Fraunces ,  & at their retorne she led F. J. into his Mistres chamber, whom thei found lying on hir bed, whether galded with any grief, or weary of the thing (which you wrot of) I know not, but there she lay: vnto who F. J. gaue two or three salutatios before she seemed to mark him. At last said the Lady Fraunces vnto hir, your seruat hearing of your sicknes, hath aduetured thus far into the ayre to see you. I thank him (qd Dame Elynor ) & so lay still, refusing to giue him any coutenace. Wherat F. J. perceyuing al the other gentlewomen fal to whispering, thoght good, boldly to plead his own case:  & aproching the bed bega to enforce his vnwilling mistres vnto curtesie, wherin he vsed such vehemece as she could not well by any meanes refuse to talke with him: but what their talk was I may not take vpo me to tell you vnlesse you would haue me fill vp a whole volume only with his matters, and I haue dilated the ouer largely already. Suffyseth this to be knowne, that in the ende shee pretended to passe ouer all old grudges, & thenceforth to pleasure him as accasion might serue: the which occasion was so long in hapening, that in the end F. J. being now eftsones troubled with vnquiet fantasies,  & forced to vse his pen again as an Ambassadour betwene the: one daye amongst the rest found oportunitie to thrust a letter into hir bosome, wherin he had earnestly requested another mooneshyne banquet or frydayes breakfast to recomfort his dulled spirits, wherunto the Dame yeelded this aunswer in writing, but of whose endyting iudge you. G. T. I can but smyle at your simplicity, who burden your friends with an impossibility. The case so stood as I could not though I would. Wherefore from henceforth eyther learne to frame your request more reasonably, or else stand content with a flat repulse. SHE. F. J. liked this letter but a little: and being thereby drouen into his accustomed vayne, he compiled in verse this answere following, vppon these woords conteined in hir letter, I could not though I would . G. T.  J could not though J would: good Lady say not so, Since one good word of your good wil might soone redesse my wo Where would is free before, there could can neuer fayle: For profe, you see how gallies passe where ships ca beare no sayle. The weary mariner when skies are ouercast, By ready will doth guyde his skill and wins the hauen at last. The prety byrd that sings with pricke against hir brest, Doth make a vertue of hir need to watch when others rest. And true the prouerbe is, which you haue layed apart, There is no hap can seeme to hard vnto a willing hart. Then louely Lady myne, you say not as you should, Jn doubtful termes to aunswer thus: J could not thogh J would. Yes, yes full well you know, your can is quicke and good: And wilfull will is eke too swift to shed my giltlesse blood. But if good will were bent as prest as power is, Such will would quickly find the skill to mend that is amisse. Wherfore if you desire to see my true loue spilt, Commaund and I will slea my self, that yours may be the gilt. But if you haue no power to say your seruaunt nay, Write thus: J may not as J would, yit must J as J may. F. J.  Thvs F. J. replied vpon his Mistres aunswer, hoping therby to recouer some fauour at hir hads, but it wold not be: so that now he had bene as likely (as at the first) to haue fretted in fantasies, had not the Lady Fraunces continually comforted him: and by little  & little she droue such reason into his minde, that now he began to subdue his humors with discretion, and to determine that if hee might espie euident profe of his Mistresse frayeltie, hee would then stand content with pacience perforce; & giue his Mistres the Bezo las manos . And it happened one day amongst others, that he resorted to his Mistresse chamber & found hir ( allo solito ) lying vpon hir bed,  & the secretary with Dame Pergo & hir handmayd keping of hir copany. Wherat F. J. somwhat repyning, came to hir and fell to dalliace, as one yt had now rather adueture to be thought presumptious than yeeld to be accompted bashfull, he cast his arme ouer his Mistresse and began to accuse hir of slogishnes, vsing some other bold partes, as well to prouoke hir, as also to greeue the other. The Lady seemed little to delight in his dallying, but cast a glance at hir secretary and therwith smyled, when as the Secretary  & dame Pergo burst out into open laughter. The which F. I. perceyuing, and disdayning hir ingratitude, was forced to depart, and in that fantasie compyled this Sonet. G. T.  J stoode of late to plead for pittie so: And as J did hir louely lookes behold, She cast a glance vppon my ryuall foe. His fleering face prouoked hir to smyle, When my salte teares were drowned in disdayne: He glad, J sad, he laught, (alas the while) J wept for woe: J pyn'd for deadly payne. And when J sawe none other boote preuayle, But reasons rule must guide my skilfull minde: Why then (quod I) olde prouerbes neuer fayle, For yet was neuer good Cat out of kinde: Nor woman true but euen as stories tell, Woon with an egge, and lost againe with shell. F. J. This Sonet declareth that he began nowe to accompt of hir as she deserued, for it hath a sharpe conclusion, and it is somewhat too generall. Wel, as it is he lost it where his Mistresse found it, and she immediatly emparted the same vnto Dame Pergo , and Dame Pergo vnto others: so that it quickely became common in the house. Amongst others Mistresse Fraunces hauing recouered a copie of it, did seeme to pardon the generallitie, and to be well pleased with the perticularitie therof, the which she bewrayed one day vnto F. I. in this wise. Of all the ioyes that euer I had (my good Trust quod she) there is none wherein I take more comforte than in your conformitie, and although your present rage is such that you can bee content to condemne a nomber vnknowen, for the transgression of one too well knowne: yet I do rather reioyce that you should iudge your pleasure ouer many, than to be abused by any. My good Hope (quod he) it were not reason that after such manifold proofes of your exceding curtesies, I should vse straunge or contentious speech with so deare a friend, and in deede I must confesse that the opinion which I haue conceiued of my Mistresse, hath stirred my penne to write very hardly against all the feminine gender, but I pray you pardon me (quod he)  & if it please you I wil recant: it as also (percase) I was but cloyed with Surquedry , and presumed to think more than may be proued. Yea but how if it were proued quod Dame Fraunces? If it were so (which God forbid quod he) then coulde you not blame me to conceiue that opinion. Howsoeuer I might blame you (quod she) I meane not to blame you, but I demaund further, if it be as I thinke  & you suspect, what will you then do? Surely (quod F. I. ) I haue determed to drinke vp mine owne sorowe secretely, and to bid them both a Dieu . I like your farewell better than your fantasie (quod she) and whensoeuer you can be content to take so much paynes, as the Knight (which had a night gowne garded with naked swordes) dyd take, I thinke you may put your selfe out of doubt of all these thinges. By these wordes and other speech which she vttered vnto him, F. I. smelt how the world went about, and therfore did one day in ye grey morning adueture to passe through the gallery towards his Mistres chamber, hoping to haue found the doore open, but he found the contrary, and there attending in good deuocion, heard the parting of his Mistresse and hir Secretary, with many kind words: wherby it appeared that the one was very loth to departe from the other. F. I. was enforced to beare this burden, and after he had attended there as long as the light wold giue him leaue, he departed also to his chamber, and aparaling himselfe, could not be quiet vntill he had spoken with his Mistresse, whom he burdened flatly with this despitefull trechery: and she as fast denied it, vntill at last being still vrged with such euident tokens as he alleged, she gaue him this bone to gnawe vppon. And if I did so (quod she) what than? Whereunto F. I. made none answere, but departed with this farewel. My losse is mine owne, and your gayne is none of yours, and soner can J recouer my losse than you enioye the gaine which you gape after . And whan he was in place sollitary, he compyled these following for a fynall end of the matter. G. T.  And if J did what then? Are you agreeu'd therfore? The Sea hath fishe for euery man, And what would you haue more? Thus did my Mistresse once, Amaze my mind with doubt: And popt a question for the nonce, To beate my braynes about. Wherto J thus replied, Eche fisherman can wishe, That all the Sea at euery tyde, Were his alone to fishe. And so did J (in vaine,) But since it may not be: Let such fishe there as find the gaine, And leaue the losse for me. And with such lucke and losse, J will content my selfe: Till tydes of turning time may tosse, Such fishers on the shelfe. And when they sticke on sands, That euery man may see: Then will J laugh and clappe my hands, As they do now at meo. F. J. It is time now to make an end of this thriftlesse Historie, wherein although I could wade much further, as to declare his departure, what thankes he gaue to his Hope &c. Yet I will cease, as one that had rather leaue it vnperfect than make it to plaine. I haue past it ouer with quod he, and quod she, after my homely manner of writing, vsing sundry names for one person, as the Dame, the Lady, Mistresse, &c. The Lorde of the Castle, the Master of the house, and the hoste: neuerthelesse for that I haue seene good aucthors terme euery gentlewoman a Lady, and euery gentleman domine , I haue thought it no greater faulte then pettie treason thus to entermyngle
