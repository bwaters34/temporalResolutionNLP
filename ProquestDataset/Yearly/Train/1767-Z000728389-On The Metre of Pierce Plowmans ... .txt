 tho' the ravages of time will not suffer us now to produce a regular series of poems entirely written in it. There are some readers, whom it may gratify to mention, that these Visions of Pierce [i.e. Peter] the Plowman , are attributed to Robert Langland, a secular priest, born at Mortimer's Cleobury in Shropshire, and fellow of Oriel college in Oxford, who flourished in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II. and published his poem a few years after 1350. It consists of xx , exhibiting a series of visions, which he pretends happened to him on Malvern hills in Worcestershire. The author excells in strong allegoric painting, and has with great humour spirit and fancy, censured most of the vices incident to the several professions of life; but he particularly inveighs against the corruptions of the clergy, and the absurdities of superstition. Of this work I have now before me four different editions in black letter quarto. Three of them are printed in 1550 by Roberte Crowsey dwelling in Clye rentes in Molburne. It is remarkable that two of these are mentioned in the title-page as both of the second imperssion, tho' they contain evident variations in every page  6 . The other is said to be newlye imprynted after the authors of olde copy ... by Owen Rogers, Feb. 21. 1561. As Langland was not the first, so neither was he the last that used this alliterative species of verification. To Rogers's edition of the Visions is subjoined a poem, which was probably writ in imitation of them, intitled Pierce the Ploughman's Crede. It begins thus, Cros , and Curteis Christ , this beginning spede For the Faders Frendshipe , that Fourmed heaven, And through the Special Spirit , that Sprong of hem tweyne, And al in one godhed endles dwelleth." The author feigns himself ignorant of his Creed, to be instructed in which he applies to the four religious orders, viz. the gray friers of St. Francis, the black friers of St. Dominic, the Carmelites or white friers, and the Augustines. This affords him occasion to describe in very lively colours the sloth, ignorance, and immorality of those reverend drones. At length he meets with Pierce a poor Ploughman, who resolves his doubts, and instructs him in the principles of true religion. The author was evidently a follower of Wiecliff, whom he mentions (with honour) as no longer living  7 . Now that reformer died in 1384. How long after his death this poem was written, does not appear. In the Cotton library is a volume of ancient English poems  8 , two of which are written in this alliterative metre, and have the division of the lines into distichs distinctly marked by a point, as is usual in old poetical MSS. That which stands first of the two (tho' perhaps the latest written) is intitled The sege of ierlam , [i.e. Jerusalem], being an old fabulous legend composed by some monk, and stuffed with marvellous figments concerning the destruction of the holy city and temple. It begins thus, "In Tyberius Tyme. the Trewe emperour Syr Sesar hymself. beSted in Rome Whyll Pylat was Provoste. under that Prynce ryche And Jewes Justice also. of Judeas londe Herode under empere. as Herytage wolde Kyng ,  &c. The other is intitled Chevelere Assigne [or De Cigne], that is "The Knight of the Swan," being an ancient Romance, beginning thus, "All- Weldynge God. Whence it is his Wylle Wele he Wereth his Werke. With his owene honde For ofte Harmes were Hente. that Helpe wene myzte Nere the Hyznes of Hym. that lengeth in Hevene For this, &c. Among Mr. Garrick's collection of old plays  9 is a prose narrative of the adventures of this same Knight of the Swan, "newly translated out of Frenshe into Englyshe at thinstigacion of the puyssaunt and illustryous prynce, lorde Edward duke of Buckynghame." This lord it seems had a peculiar interest in the book, for in the preface the translator tells us, that this "highe dygne and illustryous prynce my lorde Edwarde by the grace of god Duke of Buckyngham, erle of Hereforde, Stafforde, and Northampton, desyrynge cotydyally to encrease and augment the name and same of such as were relucent in vertuous seates and triumphaunt actes of chyvalry, and to encourage and styre every lusty and gentell herte by the exemply-ficacoyn of the same, havyng a goodli booke of the highe and miraculous histori of a famous and puyssaunt kynge, named Oryant, sometime reynynge in the parties of beyonde the sea, havynge to his wife a noble lady; of whome she conceyved sixe sonnes and a daughter, and chylded of them at one only time; "at whose byrthe echone of them had a chayne of sylver at their neckes, the whiche were all tourned by the provydence of god into whyte swannes (save one) of the whiche this present hystory is compyled, named Helyas, the knight of the swanne, OF WHOME LINIALLY IS DYSCENDED MY SAYDE LORDE . The whiche ententifly to have the sayde hystory more amply and unyversally knowen in thys hys natif countrie, as it is in other, hath of hys hie bountie by some of his faithful and trusti servauntes cohorted mi mayster Wynkin de Worde  10 to put the said vertuous hystori in prynte .....at whose instigacion and stiring I (Roberte Copland) have me applied, moiening the helpe of god, to reduce and translate it into our maternal and vulgare english tonge after the capacite and rudenesse of my weke entendement."---A curious picture of the times! While in Italy literature and the fine arts were ready to burst forth with classical splendor under Leo X. the first peer of this realm was proud to derive his pedigree from a fabulous KNIGHT OF THE SWAN 11 . To return to the Metre of Pierce Plowman: In the folio MS. so often quoted in these volumes, are two poems written in that species of versification. One of these is an ancient allegorical poem, intitled Death and Liffe , (in 2 fitts or parts, containing 458 distichs) which, for ought that appears, may have been written as early, if not before, the time of Langland. The first forty lines are broke as they should be into distichs, a distinction that is neglected in the remaining part of the poem, in order I suppose to save room. It begins, " Christ Christen king, that on the Crosse tholed; Hadd Paines and Passyons to defend our soules; Give us Grace on the Ground the Greatlye to serve, For that Royall Red blood that Rann from they side." The subject of this piece is a vision, wherein the poet sees a contest for superiority between "our lady Dame " LIFE ," and the "ugly fiend Dame DEATH ;" who with their several attributes and concomitants are personified in a fine vein of allegoric painting. Part of the description of Dame Life is, "Shee was Brighter of her Blee, then was the Bright sonn: Her Rudd Redder then the Rose, that on the Rise hangeth: Meekely smiling with her Mouth, And Merry in her lookes; Ever Laughing for Love, as shee Like would. And as shee came by the Bankes, the Boughes eche one They Lowted to that Ladye, and Layd forth their branches; Blossomes , and Burgens Breathed full sweete; Flowers Flourished in the Frith, where shee Forth stepped; And the Grasse , that was Gray, Greened belive." The other poem is that, which is quoted in the 27th page of this volume, and which was probably the last that was ever written in this kind of metre in its original simplicity unaccompanied with rhyme. It should have been observed above in pag. 27. that in this poem the lines are throughout divided into distichs, thus: Grant Gracious God, Grant me this time,  &c. It is intitled Scottish feilde (in 2  FITTS , 420 distichs,) containing a very circumstantial narrative of the battle of Flodden, fought Sept. 9. 1513: at which the author seems to have been present from his speaking in the first person plural, "Then WE Tild downe OUR Tents, that To'd were a thousand." In the conclusion of the poem he gives this account: of himself, "He was a Gentleman by Jesu, that this Gest made: Which Say but as he Sayd 12 for Sooth and noe other. At Bagily that Bearne his Biding place had; And his ancestors of old time have yearded 13 theire longe, Before William Conquerour this Cantry did inhabitt. Jesus Bring 'them  14 to Blisse , that Brought us forth of BALE, That hath Hearkened me Heare or Heard my TALE." The village of Bagily or Baguleigh is in Cheshire, of which county the author appears to have been, from other passages in the body of the poem, particularly from the pains he takes to wipe off a stain from the Cheshire- men, who it seems ran away in that battle, and from his encomiums on the Stanleys earls of Derby, who usually headed that county. He laments the death of James Stanley bishop of Ely, as what had recently happened when this poem was written: which serves to ascertain its date, for that prelate died March 22. 1514-5. Thus have we traced the Alliterative Measure so low as the sixteenth century. It is remarkable that all such poets as used this kind of metre, retained along with it many peculiar Saxon idioms, particularly such as were appropriated to poetry: this deserves the attention of those, who were desirous to recover the laws of the ancient Saxon Poesy, usually given up as inexplicable: I am of opinion that they will find what they seek in the Metre of Pierce Plowman. 15 About the beginning of the sixteenth century this kind of versification began to change its form: the author of Scottish Field , we see, concludes his poem with a Couplet of Rhymes: this was an innovation, that did but prepare the way for the general admission of that more modish ornament; till at length the old uncouth verse of the ancient writers would no longer go down without it. Yet when Rhyme began to be superadded, all the nicetics of Alliteration were at first retained along with it; and the song of Little John Nobody exhibits this union very clearly. By degrees the correspondence of final sounds engrosing the whole attention of the poet and fully satisfying the reader, the internal imbellishment of Alliteration was no longer studied, and thus was this kind of metre at length swallowed up and lost in our common Burlesque Alexandrine, or Anapestic verse, 16 now never used but in ballads and pieces of light humour, as in the following Song of Conscience , and in that well-known doggrel, "A cobler there was, and he lived in a stall." But although this kind of measure hath with us been thus degraded, it still retains among the French its ancient dignity: their grand Heroic Verse of twelve syllables  17 is the same genuine offspring of the old alliterative metre of the ancient Gothic and Francic poets, stript like our Anapestic of its alliteration, and ornamented with rhyme: But with this difference, that whereas this kind of verse hath been applied by us only to light and trivial subjects, to which by its quick and lively measure it seemed best adapted, our Poets have let it remain in a more lax unconfined state,  18 as a greater degree of severity and strictness would have been inconsistent with the light and airy subjects to which they have applied it. On the other hand, the French having retained this Verse as the vehicle of their Epic and Tragic flights, in order to give it a stateliness and dignity were obliged to confine it to more exact laws of Scansion; they have therefore limited it to the number of twelve Syllables; and by making the Caesura or Pause as full and distinct as possible; and by other severe restrictions, have given it all the solemnity of which it was capable. The harmony of both however depends so much on the same flow of cadence and disposal of the pause, that they appear plainly to be of the same original; and every French heroic verse evidently consists of the ancient Distich of their Francic ancestors: which, by the way, will account to us why this verse of the French so naturally resolves itself into two complete hemistics. And indeed by making the caesura or pause always to rest on the last syllable of a word, and by making a kind of pause in the sense, the French poets do in effect reduce their hemistics to two distinct and independent verses: and some of their old poets have gone so far as to make the two hemistics rhyme to each other  19 . After all, the old alliterative and anapestic metre of the English poets being chiefly used in a barbarous age, and in a rude unpolished language, abounds with verses defective in length, proportion, and harmony; and therefore cannot enter into a comparison with the correct versification of the best modern French writers; but making allowances for these defects, that sort of metre runs with a cadence so exactly resembling the French heroic Alexandrine, that I believe no peculiarities of their versification can be produced, which cannot be exactly matched in the alliterative metre. I shall give by way of example a few lines from the modern French poets confronted with parallels from the ancient poem of Life and Death : in these I shall denote the C aesura or Pause by a perpendicular line, and the Cadence by the marks of the Latin quantity. Le succes fut toujours          un enfant de l' audace  ; All shall drye with the dints          that I deal with my hands. L' homme prudent voit trop          l' illusion le fait, Yonder damsel is death          that dresseth her to smite. L' intrepide voit mieux          il le faut me fuir  20 . When she dolefully saw          how she dang downe hir folke. Meme aux yeux de l' injuste          un injuste est horrible  21 Then she cast up a crye          to the high king of heaven. Du mensonge toujours          le vrai demeure maitre, Thou shalt bitterlye bye          or else the booke faileth Pour paraitre honnete homme          en un, mot il faut l' etre  22 Thus I fared throughe a frythe          where the flowers were manye. To conclude; the metre of Pierce Plowman's Visions has no kind of relation with what is commonly called Blank Verse; yet has it a sort of harmony of its own, proceeding not so much from its alliteration, as from the artful disposal of its cadence, and the contrivance of its pause. So that when the ear is a little accustomed to it, it is by no means unpleasing; but claims all the merit of the French heroic numbers, only far less polished; being sweetened, instead of their final rhymes, with the internal recurrence of similar sounds.
