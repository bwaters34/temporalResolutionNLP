 people, and their country at this day belongs to the crown of Denmark  6 ; so that when the Danes again infested England, three or four hundred years after, they made war on the descendents of their own ancestors  7 . From this near affinity we might expect to discover a strong resemblance between both nations in their customs, manners, and even language; and in fact we find them to differ no more, than would naturally happen between a parent country and its own colonies, that had been severed in a rude uncivilised state, and had dropt all intercourse for three or four centuries. Especially if we reflect, that the colony here settled had adopted a new Religion, extremely opposite in all respects to the ancient Paganism of the mother- country; and that even at first, along with the original Angli, had been incorporated a large mixture of Saxons from the neighbouring parts of Germany; as afterwards, among the Danish invaders, had come vast multitudes of adventurers from the more northern parts of Scandinavia. But all these were only different tribes of the same common Teutonic Stock, and spoke only different dialects of the same Gothic Language. From this sameness of original and similarity of manners, we might justly have wondered, if a character so dignified and distinguished among the ancient Danes, as the Scald or Bard , had been totally unknown or unregarded in this sister nation. And indeed this argument is so strong, and, at the same time, the early annals of the Anglo-Saxons are so scanty and defective [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301007&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) , that no objections from their silence could be sufficient to overthrow it. For if these popular bards were confessedly revered and admired, in those very countries which the Anglo-Saxons inhabited before their removal in to Britain; and if they were afterwards common and numerous among their own descendents here after the Norman Conquest, what could have become of them in the intermediate time? Can we do otherwise than conclude, that this order of men still subsisted here, though perhaps with less splendour than in the North; and that there never was wanting a succession of them to hand down the art, though some particular conjunctures may have rendered it more respectable at one time than another? And this was really the case. For though much greater honours seem to have been heaped upon the northern Scalds , in whom the characters of historian, genealogist, poet, and musician were all united, than appear to have been paid to the Minstrels and Harpers [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301008&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) of the Anglo-Saxons, whose talents were chiefly calculated to entertain and divert; while the Scalds professed to inform and instruct, and were at once the moralists and theologues of their Pagan countrymen: yet the Anglo-Saxon Minstrels continued to possess no small portion of public favour; and the arts they professed were so extremely acceptable to our ancestors, that the word which peculiarly denoted their art, continues still in our language to be of all others the most expressive of that popular mirth and jollity, that strong sensation of delight, which is felt by unpolished and simple minds [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301009&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . II. Having premised these general considerations, I shall now proceed to collect from history such particular incidents as occur on this subject; and whether the facts themselves are true or not, they are related by authors who lived too near the Saxon times, and had before them too many recent monuments of the Anglo-Saxon nation, not to know what was conformable to the genius and manners of that people; and therefore we may presume, that their relations prove at least the existence of the customs and habits they attribute to our forefathers before the conquest, whatever becomes of the particular incidents and events themselves. If this be admitted, we shall not want sufficient proofs to shew, that Minstrelsy and Song were not extinct among the Anglo- Saxons; and that the professor of them here, if not quite so respectable a personage as the Danish Scald, was yet highly favoured and protected, and continued still to enjoy considerable privileges. Even so early as the first invasion of Britain by the Saxons, an incident is recorded to have happened, which if true, shews that the Minstrel or Bard was not unknown among this people; and that their princes themselves could upon occasion assume that character. Colgrin, son of that Ella who was elected king or leader of the Saxons in the room of Hengist  8 , was shut up in York, and closely besieged by Arthur and his Britons. Baldulph, brother of Colgrin, wanted to gain access to him, and to apprize him of a reinforcement which was coming from Germany. He had no other way to accomplish his design, but to assume the character of a Minstrel . He therefore shaved his head and beard, and dressing himself in the habit of that profession, took his harp in his hand. In this disguise, he walked up and down the trenches without suspicion, playing all the while upon his instrument, as an Harper . By little and little he advanced near to the walls of the city, and making himself known to the centinels, was in the night drawn up by a rope. Though the above fact comes only from the suspicious pen of Geoffry of Monmouth [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301010&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) , the judicious reader will not too hastily reject it; because if such a fact really happened, it could only be known to us through the medium of the British writers: for the first Saxons, a martial but unlettered people, had no historians of their own; and Geoffry, with all his fables, is allowed to have recorded many true events, that have escaped other annalists. We do not however want instances of a less fabulous aera, and more indubitable authority: for later History affords us two remarkable facts [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301011&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) , which I think clearly show, that the same arts of poetry and song, which were so much admired among the Danes, were by no means unknown or neglected in this sister nation; and that the privileges and honours which were so lavishly bestowed upon the northern Scalds , were not wholly with-held from the Anglo-Saxon Minstrels. Our great King Alfred, who is expressly said to have excelled in music  9 , being desirous to learn the true situation of the Danish army, which had invaded his realm, assumed the dress and character of a Minstrel [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301012&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) ; when, taking his harp, and one of the most trusty of his friends, disguised as a servant  10 (for in the early times it was not unusual for a Minstrel to have a servant to carry his harp), he went with the utmost security into the Danish camp: and though he could not but be known to be a Saxon by his dialect, the character he had assumed procured him a hospitable reception. He was admitted to entertain the king at table, and staid among them long enough to contrive that assault, which afterwards destroyed them. This was in the year 878. About sixty years after  11 , a Danish king made use of the same disguise to explore the camp of our king Athelstan. With his harp in his hand, and dressed like a Minstrel [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301013&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) , Anlaff king of the Danes went among the Saxon tents; and taking his stand near the king's pavilion, began to play, and was immediately admitted. There he entertained Athelstan and his lords with his singing and his music, and was at length dismissed with an honourable reward, though his songs must have discovered him to have been a Dane [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301014&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . Athelstan was saved from the consequences of this stratagem by a soldier, who had observed Anlaff bury the money which had been given him, either from some scruple of honour or motive of superstition. This occasioned a discovery. Now, if the Saxons had not been accustomed to have Minstrels of their own, Alfred's assuming so new and unusual a character, would have excited suspicions among the Danes. On the other hand, if it had not been customary with the Saxons to shew favour and respect to the Danish Scalds , Anlaff would not have ventured himself among them, especially on the eve of a battle [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301015&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . From the uniform procedure then of both these kings, we may fairly conclude, that the same mode of entertainment prevailed among both people, and that the But if these facts had never existed, it can be proved from undoubted records, that the Minstrel was a regular and stated officer in the court of our Anglo- Saxon kings: for in Doomesday book, Joculator Regis , the  KING'S MINSTREL , is expressly mentioned in Gloucestershire; in which county it should seem that he had lands assigned him for his maintenance [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301016&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . III. We have now brought the inquiry down to the Norman conquest; and as the Normans had been a late colony from Norway and Denmark, where the Scalds had arrived to the highest pitch of credit before Rollo's expedition into France, we cannot doubt but this adventurer, like the other northern princes, had many of these men in his train, who settled with him in his new duchy of Normandy, and left behind them successors in their art: So that, when his descendant, William the Bastard , invaded this kingdom in the following century  12 , that mode of entertainment could not but be still familiar with the Normans. And that this is not mere conjecture, will appear from a remarkable fact, which shew that the arts of Poetry and Song were still as reputable among the Normans in France, as they had been among their ancestors in the north; and that the profession of Minstrel , like that of Scald , was still aspired to by the most gallant soldiers. In William's army was a valiant warrior, named Taillefer , who was distinguished no less for the minstrel- arts [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301017&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) ,than for his courage and intrepidity. This man asked leave of his commander to begin the onset, and obtained it. He accordingly advanced before the army, and with a loud voice animated his countrymen with songs in praise of Charlemagne and Roland, and other heroes of France; then rushing among the thickest of the English, and valiantly fighting, lost his life. Indeed the Normans were so early distinguished for their minstrel talents, that an eminent French writer [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301018&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) makes no scruple to refer to them the origin of all MODERN POETRY , and shews, that they were celebrated for their Songs above a century before the TROUBADOURS of Provence, who are supposed to have led the way to the poets of Italy, France, and Spain. We see then that the Norman conquest was rather likely to favour the establishment of the minstrel profession in this kingdom, than to suppress it: and we may even conclude, that, after that period, this order of men would grow into more favour and repute; and the profession itself acquire new privileges [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301019&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . IV. After the Norman conquest I have not met with any very particular fact concerning the Minstrels , till we come down to the reign of Richard the first: and under him their profession seems to have revived with additional splendor. Richard, who was the great restorer and hero of Chivalry, was also the distingnished patron of Poets and Minstrels: He was himself of their number, and some of his verses are still extant  13 . As the Proven çal Bards were in his time in high request for the softness of their language, and the superior elegance of their compositions, Richard invited multitudes of them to his court, where he loaded them with honours and rewards: and they in return celebrated him as the most accomplished monarch in the world [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301020&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . The distinction and respect which Richard showed to men of this profession, although his favours were chiefly heaped upon foreigners, could not but recommend the profession itself among his own subjects: and therefore we may conclude, that English Minstrelsy would, in a peculiar manner, flourish in his time: and probably it is from this aera, that we are to date that remarkable intercommunity and exchange of each other's compositions, which we discover to have taken place at some early period between the French and English Minstrels: the same set of phrases, the same species of characters, incidents, and adventures, and often the same identical stories, being found in the old metrical Romances of both nations [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301021&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) The distinguished service which Richard received from one of his Minstrels, in rescuing him from his cruel and tedious captivity, is a remarkable fact, which ought to be recorded for the honour of poets and their art. This fact has lately been rescued from oblivion, and given to the world in very elegant language by an ingenious lady  14 . I shall here produce a more antiquated relation of the same event, in the words of an old neglected compiler  15 . "The Englishmen were more than a whole yeare, without hearing any tydings of their king, or in what place he was kept prisoner. He had trained up in his court a Rymer or Minstrel , called Blondell de Nesle : who (saith the Manuscript of old Poesies  16 , and an auncient Manuscript French Chronicle) being so long without the sight of his lord, his life seemed wearisome to him, and he became confounded with melancholy. Knowne it was, that he came backe from the Holy Land: but none could tell in what countrey he arrived. Whereupon this Blondel, resolving to make search for him in many countreys, but he would hear some news of him; after expence of divers dayes in travaile, he came to a towne  17 by good hap, neere to the castell where his maister king Richard was kept. Of his host he demanded, to whom the castell appertained, and the host told him, that it belonged to the duke of Austria. Then he enquired whether there were any prisoners therein detained or no: for alwayes he made such secret questionings wheresoever he came. And the host made answer, there was only one prisoner, but he knew not what he was, and yet he had bin detained there more than the space of one yeare. When Blondel heard this, he wrought such meanes, that he became acquainted with them of the castell,  AS Minstrels DOE EASILY WIN ACQUAINTANCE ANY WHERE : but see the king he could not, neither understand that it was he. One day he sat directly before a window of the castell, where king Richard was kept prisoner, and began to sing a song in French, which king Richard and Blondel had some time composed together. When king Richard heard the song, he knew it was Blondel that sung it: and when Blondel paused at half of the song, the king ' BEGAN THE OTHER HALF AND COMPLETED IT 18 . Thus Blondel won knowledge of the king his maister, and returning home into England, made the barons of the countrie acquainted where the king was." This happened about the year 1193. The next memorable event, which I find in history concerning the Minstrels, is also much to their credit; and this was their rescuing one of the great Earls of Chester when besieged by the Welsh. This happened in the reign of K. John 19 ; and is related as follows: "Hugh the first Earl of Chester, in his charter of foundation of St. Werburg's abbey in that city, had granted such a privilege to those, who should come to Chester fair, that they should not be then apprehended for theft or any other misdemeanor, except the crime were committed during the fair. This special protection caused multitudes of loose and disorderly people to resort to that fair; which afterwards proved of signal benefit to one of his successors. For Ranulph the last Earl of Chester, marching into Wales with a slender attendance, was constrained to retire to his castle of Rothelan or Rhuydland; in which he was straightly besieged by the Welsh. Finding himsself hard pressed, he contrived to give notice of his danger to Lord Roger (or John) de Lacy, Constable of Chester, who making use of the Minstrels then assembled at Chester fair: These men, like so many Tyrt aeus's, by their Music and their Songs so allured and inspirited the multitudes of loose and lawless persons then brought together, that they resolutely marched against the Welsh: Hugh de Dutton, a gallant youth, who was steward to Lacy, putting himself at their head. The Welsh alarmed at the approach of this rabble, supposing them to be a regular body of armed and disciplined veterans, instantly raised the siege and retired." For this good service, Ranulph granted to the Lacies by charter a peculiar patronage over men of this sort: who devolved the same again upon Dutton and his heirs  20 . And the MINSTRELS his assistants, enjoyed for many ages peculiar honours and privileges under the descendants of that family. For even so late as the reign of Elizabeth, when this profession had fallen into such discredit, that it was considered, in law as a nuisance, the Minstrels under the protection of the family of Dutton, are expressly excepted out of all acts of parliament made for their suppression; and have continued to be so excepted ever since [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301022&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . The ceremonies attending the exercise of this jurisdiction, are thus described by Dugdale as handed down to his time, viz. "That at Midsummer fair, all the minstrels of that country resorting to Chester, do attend the heir of Dutton, from his lodging to St. John's church (he being then accompanied by many gentlemen of the countrey) one of 'the minstrels' walking before him in a furcoat of his arms depicted on taffata; the rest of his fellows proceeding two and two, and playing on their several sorts of musical instruments. And after divine service 'is' ended, 'they' give the like attendance on him back to his lodging; where a court being kept by his [Mr. Dutton's] Steward, and all the Minstrels formally called; certain orders and laws are usually made for the better government of that Society, with Penalties to those who shall transgress them." To resume the thread of this slight history, in the reign of Edward I. (severe as that monarch was in extirpating the Bards of Wales), a MULTITUDE OF court at the solemn act of knighting his son [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301023&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) : and under the reign of his son, such extensive privileges were claimed by these men, and by dissolute persons assuming their character, that it became a matter of public grievance, and was obliged to be reformed by an express regulation in the year 1315 [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301024&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . Notwithstanding which, an incident is recorded in the ensuing year, which shows that Minstrels still retained the liberty of entering at will into the royal presence, and had something peculiarly splendid in their dress. It is thus related by Stow [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301025&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) "In the year 1316, Edward the second did solemnize his feast of Pentecost at Westminster, in the great hall: where sitting royally at the table with his peers about him, there entered a woman ADORNED LIKE A Minstrel , sitting on a great horse trapped,  AS Minstrels THEN USED , who rode round about the tables, shewing pastime: and at length came up to the king's table, and laid before him a letter, and forthwith turning her horse saluted every one and departed."---The subject of this letter was a remonstrance to the king on the favours heaped by him on his minions, to the neglect of his knights and faithful servants. It was a Minstrel who was deputed to this office, as one of that character was sure of gaining an easy admittance: and a Female Minstrel was the rather chosen, I suppose, as more likely to disarm the king's resentment: for there should seem to have been women of this profession, as well as those of the other sex [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301026&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . In the fourth year of Richard II.  21 John of Gaunt erected at Tutbury in Staffordshire, a Court of Minstrels , with a full power to receive suit and service from the men of this profession within five neighbouring counties, to enact laws, and determine their controversies; and to apprehend and arrest such of them, as should refuse to appear at the said court, annually held on the 16th of August. For this they had a charter by which they were empowered to appoint a King of the Minstrels with four officers to preside over them [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301027&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . These were every year elected with great ceremony, the whole form of which is described by Dr. Plott  22 ; in whose time however they appear to have lost their singing talents, and to have become mere musicians. Even so late as the reign of Henry VIII, a stated number of Minstrels were retained in all great and noble families, as appears from the Establishment of the Houshold of the then Earl of Northumberland [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301028&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) and we find, that it was at that time a common entertainment to hear verses recited, or moral speeches learned for that purpose, by a set of men who got their livelihood by repeating them, and who intruded without ceremony into all companies; not only in taverns, but in the houses of the nobility themselves. This we learn from Erasmus, whose argument led him only to describe a species of these men who DID NOT SING their compositions; but the others that DID , enjoyed without doubt the same privileges [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301029&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) . The Reader will find that the Minstrels continued down to the reign of Elizabeth; in whose time they had lost much of their dignity, and were sinking into contempt and neglect. Yet still they sustained a character far superior to any thing we can conceive at present of the singers of old ballads  23 . When Queen Elizabeth was entertained at Killingworth Castle by the Earl of Leicester in 1575, among the many devices and pageants which were exhibited for her entertainment, one of the personages introduced was that of an ancient writer there present [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=14301030&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EE01A21C1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) , and give us so distinct an idea of the character, that I shall quote the passage at large. "A Person very meet seemed he for the purpose, of a xlv years old, apparelled partly as he would himself. His cap off: his head seemly rounded Tonsterwise  24 : fair kembed, that with a sponge daintily dipt in a little capon's greace was finely smoothed, to make it shine like a mallard's wing. His beard smugly shaven: and yet his shirt after the new trink, with ruffs fair starched, sleeked and glistering like a pair of new shoes, marshalled in good order with a setting stick, and strut, 'that' every ruff stood up like a wafer. A side [i.e. long] gown of Kendale green, after the freshness of the year now, gathered at the neck with a narrow gorget, fastened asore with a white clasp and a keeper close up to the chin; but easily, for heat, to undo when he list. Seemly begirt in a red caddis girdle: from that a pair of capped Sheffield knives hanging a' two sides. Out of his bosom drawn forth a lappet of his napkin  25 edged with a blue lace, and marked with a D for Damian, for he was but a batchelor yet. His gown had side [i.e. long] sleeves down to mid-leg, slit from the shoulder to the hand, and lined with white cotton. His doublet-sleeves of black worsted: upon them a pair of points of tawny chamlet laced along the wrist with blue threaden poinets  26 , a wealt towards the hands of fustian-a-napes. A pair of red neather stocks. A pair of pumps on his feet, with a cross cut at his toes for corns: not new indeed, yet cleanly blackt with soot, and shining as a shoing horn. About his neck a red ribband suitable to his girdle. His HARP in good grace dependent before him. His WREST 27 tyed to a green lace and hanging by: Under the gorget of his gown a fair flaggon chain, (pweter  28 for) SILVER , as a SQUIRE Minstrel of Middlesex , that travelled the country this summer season, unto fair and worshipful mens houses. From his chain hung a scutcheon, with metal and colour, resplendant upon his breast, of the ancient arms of Islington." \---This Minstrel is described as belonging to that village. I suppose such as were retained by noble families, wore the arms of their patrons hanging down by a silver chain as a kind of badge  29 . From the expression of Squire Minstrel above, we may conclude there were other inferior orders, as Yeomen Minstrels , or the like. This Minstrel, the author tells us a little below, "after three lowly courtesies, cleared his voice with a hem, ... and wiped his lips with the hollow of his hand for 'filing his napkin, tempered a string or two with his WREST , and after a little warbling on his HARP for a prelude, came forth with a solemn song, warranted for story out of King Arthur's acts, &c."---This song the reader will find printed in this work, volume III. pag. 25. and some farther account of the state of Minstrelsy and Ballad-singing in Q. Elizabeth's reign, in Vol. II. p. 166, &c. Towards the end of the sixteenth century this class of men had lost all credit, and were sunk so low in the public opinion, that in the 39th year of Elizabeth  30 , a statute was passed by which "Minstrels, wandering abroad," were included among "rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars," and were adjudged to be punished as such. This act seems to have put an end to the profession, for after this time they are no longer mentioned. V. I CANNOT conclude this account of the ancient Minstrels , without remarking that they are most of them represented to have been of the North. There is hardly an ancient Ballad or Romance, wherein a Minstrel or Harper appears, but he is characterized by way of eminence to have been "  OF THE :" and indeed the prevalence of the Northern dialect in such kind of poems, shews that this representation is real. The reason of which seems to be this; the civilizing of nations has begun from the South: the North would therefore be the last civilized, and the old manners would longest subsist there. With the manners, the old poetry that painted these manners would remain likewise; and in proportion as their boundaries became more contracted, and their neighbours refined, the poetry of those rude men would be more distinctly peculiar, and that peculiarity more strikingly remarked. The Reader will observe in the more ancient ballads of this collection, a cast of style and measure very different from that of contemporary poets of a higher class: many phrases and idioms, which the Minstrels seem to have appropriated to themselves, and a very remarkable licence of varying the accent of words at pleasure, in order to humour the flow of the verse, particularly in the rhimes; as  32 Countr ie   harp er   batt el   morn ing ------------ Lad ie   fing er   dams el   lov ing, instead of co untry, lady, harper, singer , &c.---This liberty is but sparingly assumed by the classical poets of the same age; or even by the latter composers of Heroical Ballads: I mean by such as professedly wrote for the press. For it is to be observed, that so long as the Minstrels subsisted, they seem never to have designed their rhimes for literary publication, and probably never committed them to writing themselves: what copies are preserved of them were doubtless taken down from their mouths. But as the old Minstrels gradually wore out, a new race of Ballad-writers succeeded, an inferior sort of minor poets, who wrote narrative songs merely for the press. Instances of both may be found in the reign of Elizabeth. The two latest pieces in the genuine strain of the old Minstrelsy that I can discover, are No. III. and IV. of Book III. in this volume. Lower than these I cannot trace the old mode of writing. The old Minstrel-ballads are in the northern dialect, abound with antique words and phrases, are extremely incorrect, and run into the utmost licence of metre; they have also a romantic wildness, and are in the true spirit of chivalry.---The other sort are written in exacter measure, have a low or subordinate correctness, sometimes bordering on the insipid, yet often well adapted to the pathetic; these are generally in the southern dialect, exhibit a more modern phraseology, and are commonly descriptive of more modern manners.--- To be sensible of the difference between them, let the Reader compare in this volume No. III. of Book III. with No. X. of Book II. Towards the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, (as is mentioned above), the genuine old Minstrelsy seems to have been extinct, and thenceforth the Ballads that were produced were wholly of the latter kind, and these came forth in such abundance, that in the reign of James I. they began to be collected into little miscellanies, under the name of Garlands , and at length to be written purposely for such collections.
