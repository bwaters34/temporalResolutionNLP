 sung to one another at their drunken Meetings; Thus Poetry was entirely Corrupted, and the present scarce retains any Mark of Religion. The Poets which followed, and who were (properly speaking,) the Philosophers and Divines of those Times, seeing the desire the People had for those Feasts, and Shows, and impossibility of retrieving the first Simplicity; took another way to remedy this Disorder, and making an advantage of the Peoples Inclinations, gave them Instructions, disguis'd under the Charmes of Pleasure, as Physicians gild and sweeten the bitter Pills they administer to their Patients. I shall not recount all the different Changes, which have happen'd in Poetry, and by what degrees it has arrived to the Perfection, we now find it; I have spoken of it already in my Commentaries on Horace's Art of Poetry, and shall say more in explaining, what Aristotle writes in this Treatise. Homer was the first that invented, or finished, an Epick Poem, for he found out the Unity of the Subject, the Manners, the Characters, and the Fable. But this Poem could only effect Customes, and was not moving enough to Correct the Passions, there wanted a Poem, which by imitating our Alions, might work in our Spirits a more ready and sensible effect. 'Twas this, which gave occasion for Tragedy, and banished all Satyrs, by this means Poetry was entirely purg'd from all the disorders its Corruption had brought it into. This is no proper place to show, that Men who are quickly weary of regulated Pleasures, took pains to plunge themselves again into their former Licentiousness by the invention of Comedy. I shall keep my self to Tragedy, which is the most noble Imitation, and principal Subject of this Treatise, all the Parts of an Epick Poem are comprized in ae Tragedy. However short this account may be, it suffices to let you see that Poesie is an Art, for since it has a certain End, there must necessarily be some way to arrive there: No body doubts of this constant Truth, that in all concerns where you may be in the right, or the wrong, there is an Art and sure Rules to lead you to the one, and direct you, how to avoid the other. The question then is, whether the Rules of this Art are known, and whether they are those which Aristotle gives us here? This question is no less doubtful, than the former, I must also confess that this cannot be determined, but by the unlearned: who because they are the greater number, I shall make my Examination in their favour. To do this with some sort of Method, there are four Things to be consider'd, who gives the Rules, the time when he gives them; the manner in which he gives them, and the effects they have in divers times wrought on different People: For I believe from these four Circumstances, I can draw such Conclusions, that the most obstinate shall not be able to gainsay. He who gives these Rules, is one of the greatest Philosophers that ever was, his Genius was large, and of vast extent, the great Discoveries he made in all Sciences, and particularly in the Knowledge of Man, are certain Signs, that he had a sufficient insight into our Passions, to discover the Rules of the Art of Poetry, which is founded on them. But I shall suspend my Judgment, and pass on to the time in which he gave these Rules. I find that he was born in the Age in which Tragedy first appear'd, for he lived with the Disciples of Æschylus, who brought it out of Confusion; and he had the same Masters with Sophocles, and Euripides, who carried it to its utmost Perfection: Besides he was witness of the Opinion the most nice and knowing People of the World had of this Poem. 'Tis therefore impossible that Aristotle should be ignorant of the Origine, Progress, Design and Effects of this Art; and consequently even before I examine these Rules, I am well assur'd upon his account who gives them, that they have all the Certainty, and Authority, that Rules can possibly have. But when I come to examine the Manner in which Aristotle delivers them, I find them so evident and conformable to Nature, that I cannot but be sensible they are true; for what does Aristotle? He gives not his Rules as Legisltors do their Laws, without any other reason than their Wills only; he advances nothing but what is accompanied with Reason, drawn from the common Sentiment of Mankind, insomuch that the Men themselves become the Rule and Measure of what he prescribes. Thus without considering that the Rules are of almost equal Date with the Art they Teach, or any prejudice, in favour of Aristotle's name, (for 'tis the Work which ought to make the Name valued, and not the Name the Work) I am forced to submit to all his Decisions, the Truth of which I am convinc'd of in myself, and whose Certainty I discover by Reason and Experience, which never yet deceiv'd any body. To this I shall add, the Effects which these Rules have produc'd in all Ages, on different sort of People, and I see, that as they made the Beauty of Homer's Sophocles, and Euripides Poems in Greece, from which they were drawn; so four or five Hundred Years after, they adorn'd the Poems of Virgil and other famous Latin Poets, and that now after Two Thousand Years they make the best Tragedies we have, in which all that pleases, only does so, as 'tis conformable to these Rules, (and that too without our being aware of it,) and what is displeasing, is such, because it is contrary to them, for good Sense, and right Reason, is of all Countries and Places, the same Subjects which caus'd so many Tears to be shed in the Roman Theatre, produce the same Effects in ours, and those Things which gave distaste then, do the same now, from whence I am convinced, that never any Laws had either so much Force, Authority, or Might. Humane Laws expire or Change very often after the Deaths of their Authors, because Circumstances Change, and the Interests of Men, whom they are made to serve, are different; but these still take new vigor, because they are the Laws of Nature, who always acts uniformly, renews them incessantly, and gives them a perpetual Existence. I won't pretend nevertheless that the Rules of this Art, are so firmly established, that 'tis impossible to add any thing to them, for tho' Tragedy has all its proper Parts, 'tis probable one of those may yet arrive to greater Perfection. I am perswaded, that tho' we have been able to add nothing to the Subject, or Means, yet we have added something to the Manner, as you'l find in the Remarks, and all the new Discoveries are so far from destroying this Establishment, that they do nothing more than confirm it; for Nature is never contrary to herself, and one may apply to the Art of Poetry, what Hippocrates says of Physick ,  1 Physick is of long standing, hath sure Principles, and a certain way by which in the Course of many Ages, an Infinity of Things have been discovered, of which, Experience confirms the Goodness; All that is wanting, for the perfection of this Art, will without doubt be found out, by those Ingenious Men, who will search for it, according to the Instructions and Rules of the Ancients, and endeavour to arrive at what is unknown, by what is already plain: For whoever shall boast that he has obtained this Art by rejecting the ways of the Ancients, and taking a quite different one, deceives others, and is himself deceived; because that's absolutely impossible. This Truth extends it self to all Arts and Sciences, 'tis no difficult matter to find a proper Example in our Subject, there is no want of Tragedies, where the management is altogether opposite to that of the Ancients. According to the Rules of Aristotle, a Tragedy is the Imitation of an Allegorical and Universal Action, which by the means of Terror, and Compassion, moderates and corrects our Inclinatious. But according to these new Tragedies ' tis an imitation of some particular Action, which affects no body, and is only invented to amuse the Spectators, by the Plot, and unravelling a vain Intrigue, which tends only to excite and satisfie their Curiosity, and stir up their Passions, instead of rend'ring them calm and quiet. This is not only not the same Art, but can be none at all, since it tends to no good, and 'tis a pure Lye without any mixture of Truth; what advantage can be drawn from this Falshood? In a word, 'tis not a Fable, and by consequence , is in no wise a Tragedy, for a Tragedy cannot subsist without a Fable , 2 as you will see elsewhere. We come now to the first Consequence, which we draw, from what we have Establish'd, and shall endeavour to prove, that our Laws, and what pleases, can never be opposite, since the Rules were made only for what pleases, and tend only to show the way you must walk in, to do so. By this we shall destroy the false Maxim, That , all that pleases is good, and assert that we ought on the contrary to say, That , all that is good pleases, or ought to please. For the goodness of any Work whatsoever, does not proceed from this, that it gives us pleasure, but the pleasure that we have proceeds from its goodness, unless our deluded Eyes and corrupt Imaginations mislead us, for that which causes our mistakes, is not, where is, but what is not. If the Rules, and what pleased, were things opposite, you would never arrive at the giving pleasure, but by meer chance, which is absurd: There must for that reason be a certain way, which leads thither, and that way is the Rule which we ought to learn; but what is that Rule? 'Tis a Precept, which being drawn from the Pleasant and Profitable, leads us to their source. Now what is the Pleasant and Profitable? ' Tis that which pleases naturally, in all Arts 'tis this we consult, 'tis the most sure and perfect Model we can Imitate; in it we find perfect Unity and Order, for it self is Order, or to speak more properly, the effect of Order, and the Rule which conducts us thither; there is but one way to find Order, but a great many to fall into Confusion. There would be nothing bad in the World, if all that pleas'd were good; for there is nothing so ridiculous, but what will have its Admirers. You may say indeed, 'tis no truer, that what is good pleases, because we see ev'ry day Disputes about the Good and Pleasant, that the same Thing pleases some, and displeases others; nay, it pleases and displeases the very same Persons at different times: From whence then proceeds this difference? It comes either from an absolute Ignorance of the Rule, or that the Passions alter it. Rightly to clear this Truth, I believe I may lay down this Maxim, that all sensible Objects are of two sorts; some may be judged of, by Sense independantly from Reason. I call Sense that Impression which the animal Spirits make on the Soul, others can't be judged of but by Reason exercised in Science, Things simply agreeable, or disagreeable are of the first Sort, all the World may judge alike of these, for example the most Ignorant in Musick, perceives very well, when a Player on the Lute strikes one String for another, because he judges by his Sense, and that Sense is the Rule; in such occasions, we may therefore very well say, that all that pleases is good, because that which is Good doth please, or that which is Evil never fails to displease; for neither the Passions, nor Ignorance dull the Senses, on the contrary they sharpen them. 'Tit not so in Things which spring from Reason; Passion and Ignorance act very strongly on it, and oftentimes choak it, this is the Reason, why we ordinarily judge so ill, and differently concerning those Things, of which, that is the Rule and the Cause. Why, what is Bad often pleases, and that which is Good doth not always so, 'tis not the fault of the Object, 'tis the fault of him who judges; but what is Good will infallibly please those who can judge, and that's sufficient. By this we may see, that a Play, that shall bring those Things which are to be judg'd of by Reason, within the Rules, as also what is to be judg'd of by the Sense, shall never fail to please, for it will please both the Learned, and Ignorant: Now this Conformity of suffrages is the most sure, 3 or according to  Aristotle the only Mark of the Good, and Pleasant, as he proves in the following part of his Discourse. Now these Suffrages are not obtained, but by the observation of the Rules, and consequently, these Rules are the only Cause of the Good, and Pleasant, whether they are follow'd Methodically and with Design, or by Hazard only; for 'tis certain, there are many Persons who are entirely Ignorant of these Rules, and yet don't fail to succeed in several Affairs: This is far from destroying the Rules, and serves to shew their Beauty, and proves how far they are conformable to Nature, since those often follow them, who know nothing of 'em. In the Remarks you shall find many Examples of the vast difference, the observance or neglect of the Rules make in the same Subject, and by that be throughly convinc'd that they are the two only Causes of Good, or Bad Works, and that there can never be any occasion, where the perfect Harmony which is between the Rules, and what pleases, shou'd be broken. 'Tis true to come to the last Consequence, that Poetry is an Art, invented for the Instruction of Mankind, and consequently must be profitable: 'Tis a general Truth that ev'ry Art is a good Thing, because there is none whose End is not Good: But, as it is not less true, that Men ordinarily abuse the best Things, that which was design'd for an wholsome Remedy, may in time become a very dangerous Poison. I declare then that I don't speak of corrupted Tragedy, for 'tis not in vitious and depraved Works, that we must look for Reason, and the intent of Nature, but in those which are sound and perfect; I speak of Ancient Tragedy, that which is conform to Aristotle's Rules, and I dare say, 'tis the most profitable, and necessary of all Diversions. If 'twas possible to oblige Men to follow the Precepts of the Gospel, nothing could be more happy, they would find there true Peace, solid Pleasure, and a Remedy for all their Infirmities, and would look on Tragedy as useless and below them. How could they do otherwise than have this opinion? since those Pagans who apply'd themselves to the Study of Wisdome, consider'd it with the same Genius. They themselves own, that could the People be always brought up in the solid Truths of Philosophy, the Philosophers need have no recourse to Fables, to give their Instructions: But as so much Corruption was inconsistent with such Wisdom, they were forc'd to seek for a Remedy to the Disorders of their Pleasures; they then invented Tragedy, and inspir'd them with it, not as the best Employment Men could take up, but as a means, which was able to correct the excess, into which they plung'd themselves at their Feasts, and to render those amusements profitable, which Custom and their Infirmities had made necessary, and their Corruption very dangerous. Men are the same now, they were then, they have the same Passions, and run with the same Eagerness after Pleasures. To endeavour to reclaim them from that State, by the severity of Precepts, is attempting to put a Bridle on an unruly Horse in the middle of his carrier, in the mean while, there is no Medium, they run into the most criminal excess, unless you afford them regular and sober Pleasures. 'Tis a great Happiness that their remaining Reason inclines them to love Diversions, where there is Order, and Shows, where Truth is to be found, and I am perswaded, that Charity obliges us, to take advantage of this, and not to allow too much time for Debauches, which would extinguish that Spark of Reason, which yet shines in them. Those People are distemper'd, and Tragedy is all the Remedy they are capable of receiving any advantage from; for it is the only Recreation in which they can find the agreeable and Profitable. Tragedy does not only represent the Punishments, which voluntary Crimes always draw on their Authors, these are too common, and well known Truths, and leave too much liberty to our Passions; this is the meanest sort of Tragedy: But it sets forth the misfortunes which even involuntary Crimes, and those committed by Imprudence, draw on such as we are, and this is perfect Tragedy. It instructs us to stand on our guard, to refine and moderate our Passions, which alone occasion'd the loss of those unfortnnate ones. Thus the aspiring may learn to give bounds to his Ambition; the Prophane to fear God; the Malicious to forget his Wrongs; the Passionate to restrain his Anger; the Tyrant to forsake his Violence and Injustice, & c. Those idle and infirm Men, who are not able to bear the Yoak of Religion, and have need of a grosser sort of Instruction, which falls under the Senses, can never have more profitable amusements; 'twere to be wish'd, that they would renounce all other Pleasures, and love this only. If any shall now condemn  Tragedy, he must also condemn the use of Fables, which the most Holy Men have employ'd aud God himself has vouchsaf't to make use of: For Tragedy is only a Fable, and was invented as a Fable, to form the Manners, by Instructions, disguis'd under the Allegory of an Action. He must also condemn History; for History is much less Grave and Moral than Fable, insomuch as 'tis particular, when a Fable is more general, and universal, and by consequence more profitable. We may say too, that the only Aim of true Politicks, is to procure to the People Virtue, Peace and Pleasure, this Design cannot be contrary to Religion, because we chuse none of those Pleasures which destroy Virtue, or Peace. Tragedy is far from it, and endeavours only their preservation; for 'tis the only Pleasure, which disposes Men to endure their Passions, to a perfect Mediocrity, which contributes more to the maintaining of Peace, and acquisition of Virtue, than any thing else; I also believe that from this Truth, we might draw a sure Rule to judge of those Pleasures which might be permitted, and those which ought to be forbidden. You may say , Tragedy is dangerous, by reason of the abuses which creep into it. Every Thing is dangerous, and may be condemn'd at this rate, for there is nothing so excellent where Abuses may not be committed, and of which a bad, or good use may not be made. We must remember this Truth, that all Arts and Sciences, by the Ignorance and Corruption of Men, ordinarily produce false Arts, and false Sciences; but these false Arts and false Sciences, are more opposite to what they Counterfeit than any thing besides; for there is nothing more opposite to what is good, than what is bad in the same Kind. If that which is false, engages us to condemn what is true, it has gain'd its point, that's what it would have, and having thus Triumph'd over Truth, soon puts its self into its place, than which nothing can be more Pernicious. Since Tragedy has no defect, but what is external, it follows from thence, that 'tis good in its self, and consequently profitable; this cannot be contested, and those who condemn it, condemn, not only the most noble Diversion, but the most capable to raise the Courage, and form the Genius, and the only one, which can refine the Passions, and touch the most vicious and obdurate Souls. I could give many examples; but shall content my self with relating the Story of Alexander of 4 Pherea: This barbarous Man, having order'd the Hecuba of Euripides to be Acted before him, found himself so affected, that he went out before the end of the first Act, saying , That he was asham'd to be seen to weep, at the Misfortunes of Hecuba and Polyxena , when he daily imbrud his Hands in the Blood of his Citizens; he was affraid that his Heart should be truly mollify'd, that the Spirit of Tyranny would now leave the possession of his Breast, and that he should come a private person out of that Theatre into which he enter'd Master. The Actor who so sensibly touch'd him, difficultly escaped with his Life, but was secur'd by some remains of that pity, which was the cause of his Crime. A very grave Historian, makes reflection much to this purpose, and which seems to me, no indifferent one in Politicks; in speaking of the People of Arcadia, he says , That their Humanity, sweetness of Temper, respect for Religion, in a word, the Purity of their Manners, and all their Virtues proceeded chiefly from the Love they had to Musick, Which by its Melody, corrected those ill Impressions, a thick and unwholesome Air, joyn'd to a hard, and laborious way of living, made on their Bodies and Minds. He says on the contrary , That the Cynethians fell into all sorts of Crimes and Impieties, because they despised the wise Institutions of their Ancestors, and neglected this Art, which was so much the more necessary for them, as they liv'd in the coldest and worst place of Arcadia ae : There was scarcely any City in Greece , where wickedness was so great and frequent as here. If Polybius speaks thus of Musick, and accuses Ephorus, for having spoken a thing unworthy of himself, when he said , that 'twas invented to deceive Mankind; what ought we then to say of Tragedy, of which Musick is only a small part; and which is as much above it, as a Word is above an inarticulate Sound, which signifies nothing. This is what, according to my Opinion, may be truly said of Tragedy, and the Mean we ought to keep. But to the end this may be justly said, the Parts must conform themselves entirely to the Rules of Ancient Tragedy, that is to say, which endeavours rather to Instruct than Please, and regard the Agreeable, as [illeg.] means only to make the Profitable more taking; they must paint the Disorders of the Passions, and the inevitable Mischiefs which arise from thence. 'Twas for this the Greek Tragedians were so much Honour'd in their own Age, and esteem'd in those which follow'd. Their Theatre was a School, where Virtue was generally better Taught, than in the Schools of their Philosophers, and at this very Day, the reading their Pieces will Inspire an Hatred [illeg.] Vice, and a Love to Virtue. To Imitate them profitably, we should re-establish the Chorus[illeg.] which establishing the veri- Similitude of the Tragedy, gives an Opportunity to set fort to the People, those particular Sentiments, you would inspire them with, and to let them know what is Vicious or Laudable, in the Characters which are Introduc'd . Mr. Racine saw the necessity of this, and cannot be sufficiently praised for having brought it, into his two last Pieces which have happily reconcil'd Tragedy to its greatest Enemies. Those who have seen the effects of these Chorus's, cannot but be sensible of their Advantage, and by Consequence, must Consent to what I say in my Remarks. After Examples, and Authorities of this Nature I have no Reason to fear my Arguments. But enough of this Matter, tis time to come to what respects my self, and to give some Account of this Work. I have endeavour'd to make the Translation as literal as possible, being perswaded, that I could not do better, than to stick close to the Words of a Man, who wrote with wonderful Exactness, and puts in nothing, but what is to the purpose. I have nevertheless taken the Liberty sometimes, to enlarge his Thoughts, for what was understood in his time, by half a Word, would hardly be Intelligible now, unless some Pains was taken to explain it. A simple Translation of Aristotle, would be clear enough, and there would be no need of Commentaries, if we were well Instructed in those Poets, from whom he takes his Rules, but as almost all the World is Ignorant of them, and 'tis necessary to explain by Example, what is Obscure in the Rule. This is what I have endeavour'd to do in my Remarks, which will seem short, if you consider the many large Volumes which have been wrote on this little Treatise. Of all the Latin Commentators , Victorius seems to me the most Wise, Knowing, and Exact, but his Assistance is not sufficient, to give us an Understanding of Poesie. The Italian Castelvetro, has a great deal of Wit, and Knowledge, if we may call that Wit, which is only Fancy, and bestow on much Reading the name of Knowledge. If we recollect all the Qualities of a good Interpreter, we shall have an Idea just contrary to that of Castelvetro. He knew neither the Theatre, the Passions, nor the Characters; he understood neither Aristotle's Reasons, nor his Method, and strove rather to contradict, than explain him. On the other hand, he is so Infatuated with the Author's of his own Country, that he forgot how to Criticise well; he talks without Measure, like Homer's Thersites, and declares War to all that is fine. Indeed he has some good things, but 'tis not worth while to spend our time in looking after them. The French Art of Poetry by Mesnardiere, may pass for a Commentary on some Chapters of Aristotle, but that Work is of little value; for besides that Author's being no good Critick, and perpetually deceiv'd, he did not penetrate into the Meaning of the Philosopher. The Practice of the Theatre by the Abbot D'Aubignac, is infinitely better, but is rather a Sequel and Supplement, than an Explication of Aristotle; on which, a perfect Instruction in the Ancient Rules, will enable you to pass a Judgment. The Treatise of Epick Poem by Father Bossu, is above all the Moderns have done in that Kind, and is the best Commentary Extant, on what Aristotle has wrote concerning that sort of Poem; none ever penetrated deeper into the bottom of that Art, and set in a better Light (according to Aristotle's Rules ) Homer's, and Virgil's Beauties, or the Solidity, and Beauty of Aristotle's Rules, by the marvellous Conduct of those two great Poets. If he had Treated of Tragedy, as throughly, as he has done of the Epopoeia, he had left almost nothing for me to have done after him; but unfortunately, he omitted the most difficult, which he could have Explain'd much better than my self, had he had spare time. His Work however has done me great Service. I have profited by the good, which others have Wrote, and must confess, that their Faults have been useful to me. But after all, the most excellent Commentators on the Poetick Art, are the Ancient Poems, and as they gave the hint to make Rules, 'tis by them, that these ought to be Explain'd. I hope, I have not follow'd such good Guides in vain. If I have wander'd, by following them, without a true Understanding, I should be very well pleased to be put in the right way, by any, who would advise me of my Faults, or make them publickly known. Perhaps some may Reproach me, as Mr. Corneille did all the precedent Commentators . They have Explain'd Aristotle (says that great Man ) as Grammarians, or Philosophers, and not as Poets; because they had more of the Study, and Speculation, than Experience of the Theatre. The Reading them may make us more Learned, but can give us no further Insight, how we may succeed. This Reproach is founded on this general Maxim , That every one ought to be believ'd in his own Art. It seems then, that those should not pretend to explain the Rules of Poesie, who never yet made Poems. The Principle is true, but the Consequence is not so, for before that is drawn, we must see to whom the Art of Poetry, and what it produc'd, does properly belong. 'Tis not Poesie it self which is produced, for then it would have been, before it was. 'Tis Philosophy that brought it first into play, and consequently, it belongs to Philosophy, to give, and explain its Rules. This is so true, that Aristotle made not these Rules as a Poet, but as a Philosopher: And if he made them as such, why may they not be explain'd that way too? And as it was not necessary to make Dramatick Poems, to give Rules to that Art, so 'tis no more necessary that they should be made, to Explain those Rules. I don't know indeed, whether he who has made Pieces for the Theatre, is so proper to explain the Rules of this Art, as he that never did, for 'twould be a Miracle if one was not bias'd by self-Love, when the other is a dis- interested Judge, who has no other Aim, than discovering the Truth, and making it known. Mr. Corneille himself may be an Euample of this. All that he would Establish in his new Discourse of Dramatick Poetry, is less founded on Nature, than his own proper Interest. It appears by his own Words, that the design he had of defending what he had ventured on the Stage, ebliged him to forsake Aristotle's Rules, and to Establish new ones, which should be more favourable to himself; we shall see in the Remarks, whether they can bear the Test. 'Tis therefore no ways necessary to have made Poems, to prescribe Rules for Poesie, and yet much less to explain them. If it was so, I would say there were none, for of all those which have given any, I knew but one that was a Poet ; Horace himself never made an Epick Poem or a Tragedy, but to prescribe Rules for Poesie, as also to explain them; it is sufficient to know the Origine, and Scope of the Art Treated of; to have examin'd those Poems, which are the Basis and Foundation, to have made Reflections on what is agreeable, and disagreeable, and rightly to discover the Causes; this is the only necessary Knowledge I have endeavour'd to acquire, and Philosophy alone can lead me thither. I shall add once more, that if we make a Man more Learned, by explaining the Rules as a Philosopher, 'tis Impossible, but he must attain a surer Knowledge, to succeed in this Art. 'Tis true, we can't give a Genius, that's not done by Art, but we can shew the Path a Genius ought to Tread in, and that is the only Design of all Rules. I have not made the Apology of Commentators, to praise my self, for although I am no Poet, it does not follow that I cannot be a good Philosopher; I leave it to the Publick, and time, to Judge of my Work, for I will neither Court, nor slight their Favours. I have spoken very freely, in what I have pass'd my Judgment on, and in so doing, Imitated the ancient Criticks, who spared neither Demosthenes, nor Thucidides, nor Plato, nor any that was Great, or Venerable in Antiquity. A flattering Criticism would be a pleasant sort of one, when we should seek to Applaud, and the Respect due to the Name, should check the Censure due to the Fault. I am not so scrupulous, and if any one be offended, I shall Answer him as Dionysius Halicarnass aeus answered Pompey the Great, who wrote to him, to complain, that he had tax'd Plato with some Faults . The Veneration you have for Plato is Just, ( says that excellent Critick ,) but the Blame you lay on me, is not so. When any one writes on a Subject, to shew what is Good or Bad in it, he ought to discover, and mark very exactly all its Virtues, and Vices, for that is a sure way to find out the Truth, which is more valuable than all things else whatever. If I had written against Plato with a Design to Decry his Works, I should be as Impious as  5 Zoilus , but on the contrary, I would praise him, and if in doing so I have Improved any of his Defects, I have done nothing worthy of Complaint, and which was not necessary for my Design. Notwithstanding this, I have put some Bounds to this Liberty, and if I have discovered some Faults, I have conceal'd some others, that seem'd to me not so considerable. I had respect in them, to the Approbation of many Persons of Merit, for I would not run Counter to an almost Universal Consent, which always is of great Weight, and ought at least to oblige us to be cautious. But that I might give to those Persons, an Opportunity of recollecting themselves, I have endeavoured to explain the Rule, in such a manner, that they may perceive those very Faults, if they will Read the Remarks with attention. As for the rest, I had no design to offend any Body; if there are some things which make them uneasie, 'tis impossible to write any Work of this nature, without disgusting some. 'Tis also the Mark of good Criticism, as well as good Philosophy. From hence it proceeded, that Plato was blamed for having taught his Philosophy a long time, without displeasing any one Person; and they pretended by that, to say, that either his Doctrine was not good, or his Method defective, since none had by Hearing him been made sensible of that Uneasiness, which People naturally have, when they perceive themselves to be Vitious. It would be unjust to finish this Preface, without saying something of Aristotle's Life, that those who read his Work, may know something of him. He was the Son of Nicomachus, Physician of 6 Amyntas, and descended from Esculapius. His Mother was the Daughter of one of the Descendants of those, who Transplanted a Colony, from Chalcis to Stagira, in Macedonia; that is to say, she was of Noble Extraction, on both sides. He was born at Stagira, about four Hundred Years, before our Saviour. At Eighteen Years of Age, he went to Athens, and abode with Plato, he pass'd twenty Years in his School, and when his Master was dead, he went to Hermeas the Tyrant of Atarna, a City of Mysia; he went from thence to Mytelene, from whence he was call'd by Philip, to be his Son Alexander's Tutor; he was eight Years, with that Young Prince, and after Philip's Death, returned to Athens, where he Taught, in the Lyceum twelve Years, till the Death of Alexander. For Antipater having carried the War into Greece, Aristotle, who fancied, the Athenians suspected him, by reason of the strict Friendship, which was between him, and the Viceroy of Macedonia, retir'd to Calchis, where he died soon after, by a Fit of Sickness in the sixty third Year of his Age. He left one Son, and one Daughter, both Young, and made Antipater Executor of his Will, and Administrator of all his Goods, which were very considerable, if we may judge of them by Alexander's Liberality, who gave him eight Hundred Talents, for his History of Animals, that is according to the lesser Talent, one hundred and forty Thousand Pounds Sterling, or according to the greater, one Hundred eighty six Thousand, six Hundred, sixty five Pounds, thirteen Shillings and four Pence. The most precious of his Moveables was his Library, which was afterwards Sold to Ptolomy Philadelphus, and which he had Enrich'd with four Hundred Volumes, of his own making. In those of his Writings which now remain, and are happily a considerable Number, we find a very discerning Spirit, a solid Judgment, a wonderful Method, prodigious Knowledge, and an Eloguence both strong and sweet. He himself found out more, than the most Knowing now, learn with a great deal of Labour and Pains, and as for those things which depended on the Vivacity of the Spirit, no Man ever carried his Knowledge further, or Establish'd more sure, or extensive Principles. In Dialecticks, Logick, Rhetorick, Politicks, and Morality, we have little but what he taught us. By making a proper use of his Informations, there have appear'd Works in some of these Sciences, preferable to his, but his Rhetorick is the most Preferable we as yet have. His Art of Poetry is more to be admir'd, for in his Rhetorick, he made use of the Precepts of those, who Wrote before him. But he is the first that discovered the Grounds, and Secrets of Poesie, and none since have undertaken to Write, but in Explication of his Thoughts, which have serv'd, and will always serve as the Rule. He alone has Reviv'd Tragedy more than once. In effect after it was brought to its Perfection, under the Reign of Alexander, the Son of Amyntas, under the Reigns of Perdiccas, and Archelaus, and degenerated in those which follow'd, but under that of Philip, and Alexander, the Poets being Encourag'd by those Glorious Princes, and guided by Aristotle's Genius, made it flourish as before. After the Death of Alexander, it began to Languish, and never recover'd its entire Strength till the Reign of Augustus, in which the Rules of this Philosopher were Reviv'd. Since the Death of Augustus, it has grown Feeble, for more than sixteen Hundred Years, till in this last Age 'twas recover'd out of its long Decay, by Mr. Corneille, and Mr. Racine, who upheld themselves by Aristotle's Rules. So true is it, that Time is the Faithful Guardian, not only of Great Men, as Pindar saith, but also of the Liberal Arts, which it revives as occasion offers, and always under the greatest Princes. For what a good Soil and Air, are to Seeds and Fruits, such is the Glory, Grandeur, Magnificence , and Liberality of Princes, to Arts, and Sciences, which do not so much flourish under them, as by them; and we may very properly apply to this Subject the following Verse of Agathon. Art favours Fortune, Fortune favours Art. If Tragedy shall some time hence suffer any sort of Eclipse, 'twill be by the Laziness, and Haste of those Poets, who Write without being rightly Instructed . Plato in his Phedrus Introduces a young Poet seeking Sophocles and Euripides, and Accosting them thus . I can make Verses tolerably well; and I know how in my Descriptions to extend a mean Subject, and Contract a great one: I know how to excite Terror, and Compassion, and to make pitiful things appear Dreadful and Menacing. I will therefore go, and write Tragedies. Sophocles and Euripides answer'd him , Don't go so fast, Tragedy is not what you take it to be; 'tis a Body, composed of many different, and well-suited Parts, of which you will make a Monster, unless you know how to adjust them; you may know what is to be learn'd, before the Study of the Art of Tragedy; but you don't yet know that Art. If there are Poets now, which don't know so much as the Young Man, of whom Plato speaks, these Rules can be of no Advantage to them; but those who are like him, and in the same Circumstances, need only keep to these Rules , which will teach them what they are Ignorant of, and the fourth time restore Tragedy to its first Lustre and Brightness. This is the most profitable Present, can be made them, if by Meditation and Practice they will endeavour to make a right use of it; for Precepts alone are not sufficient to make us Learned, the Advantage, and Profit of any Rules, depend on our Labour and Pains. If these Rules are not for them, they will be against them, and their Works shall be Judg'd by them. The References in  Aristotles Text are to some Notes, in which the Translator thinks, he has kept nearer to the Greek than Mr. D'acier; and that they are as Expressive, tho' not so Paraphrastical, as his. All that is found in Italick Letters, in the said Text, except proper Names ,  &c. is purely Mr. D'acier's Addition; there being not the least Word of it in the Original. So that whether you read the said Notes according to the References (omitting what is Synonymous) or leave out the Italick; you will have Aristotles's Sense entire. The Design of the Author. All the different Sorts of Poetry, are only Imitations. The Differences that are between them; and the Means they use to obtain their end. The Extent of the Word Epopoeia, the Error into which we are fallen, in Characterizing Poets, according to their Verse. the Effects of each of them in particular; to explain the Number and Quality of all its Parts, and to shew in what manner a  7 Subject ought to be Constituted, to make a good Poem  8 , and to forget nothing which concerns that Art; I shall Imitate Nature, and begin with the first Strokes. 2\. The Epopoeia and  9 Tragedy, Comedy , and  10 Dithyrambicks , most part of the Airs for the Flute , and Lessons for the Harp ,  &c. are only pure Imitations. Nevertheless,  11 there are essential Differences betwixt these three Arts. The  12 first regards the Means, the  13 second the Subject, and the  14 third the Manner. For as  15 Painters imitate most things with Figures and Colours,  16 either by the assistance of Art, or Custom only, or by joyning both together; 17 so the Masters in all the Arts I am about to treat of, make their imitation with Number, Discourse, and Harmony, either joyntly or separately. 3\. The Playing on the Flute, the Harp, and if there be any other of the same nature, as the Pipe, do all employ Number, and Harmony. 4\. Dancers make use of Number only,  18 for by the means of Numbers, or figur'd Cadences, they imitate Manners, Passions, and Actions. 5\. The Epopoeia makes use of Discourse, either in Prose or Verse, whether it mixes divers sorts of Verses, or is content with one only, as it has hitherto been. 6\. I give to the Word Epopoeia, a very large signification , for otherwise we should have no general Term, which would comprehend the Farces of Sophron and Xenarchus ; the Dialogues of Socrates , and all other Imitations, which may be made in Iambick, Elegaick, or any other sort of Verse. 'Tis true, Men ordinarily distinguish Poets, by the difference of their Verse only, in calling some Elegiack Poets, others Epick or Heroick Poets, without having any regard to the Nature of their Imitation. Nay, they give the Name of an Epick, or Heroick Poet, to him who treats of Natural Philosophy, or Physick, in Hexameters. Howbeit, there is nothing common to Homer , and Empedocles , but the Verse; for which reason, 'twould be more just, to call the first a Poet, and the second a Philosopher  19 in effect, if any one should think it adviseable, to make a  20 Poem of all the different sorts of Verse, as Cheremon made his  21 Centaur , you would be oblig'd, not to give him the Name of a Poet,  22 but enough of this. 7\. Dithyrambicks, Nomes, Tragedy and Comedy , employ equally those three Means I have spoken of, viz . Number, Discourse and Harmony; that is to say, Musick; with this difference, that some use them together, and others separately.  23 So much for the Means, these Arts use, to make their Imitation. 1\. Having a Design to treat of Poesie in general.] Aristotle never puts at the Head of his Didactick Works, which he calls ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ,  , any other Preface, than a simple Explanation of his Design; he reserv'd his Exordiums, for those Books which he called ἔ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ,  , i.e. Foreign ; because they were wrote for all the World, and more for Ostentation and Pomp, than for Instruction; whereas the Acroatick were made for the particular Instruction of his Disciples. Cicero in the 16th Letter of his Fifth Book to Atticus, Quoniam in singulis libris, utor Proemiis, ut Aristoteles in iis, quos Exotericos vocat. Because I use Proems in all my Books, as Aristotle does in those he calls Exoterick . What he does in this Book of the Art of Poetry , he does also in his Morals, Dialecticks, Physicks, and in his Rhetorick; and consequently all those Books are Acroatick and not Foreign. 2\. Of Poesie in general .] It is in the Greek, Of the Poetick it self . There is a Difference between Poem, Poesie, and Poetick; Poem is the Work, Poesie is the Art, and Poetick is that which explains and gives Rules to the Art. In the Title this Word contains both the Manner and Art; and when Aristotle says here, Poetick in it self , 'tis as much as to say, Poetick in general , he puts Poetick for Poesie ; for in his Rhetorick, he quotes these Books of Poetick, under the Denomination of the Books of Poesie , ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . Poesie is then the Genus . The Matter is comprised under the Species , for the Epopoeia, Tragedy and Comedy , are so many different Species , which Constitute the Matter of Poesie; but this deserves no further Consideration. 3\. And the Effects of each of them .] The Greek says And the force which each of them has ; that is to say, The Effects which they ought to produce in our Minds. For Example, Tragedy ought to refine the Passions, by the Means of Terror and Pity. Force doth signifie in this place, Instrument or Means : These are comprised under the Name of Parts , in what follows. 4\. To explain the Number and Quality of all its Parts .] As well the Parts of Quantity as Quality, for ev'ry sort of Poesie is compos'd of a certain Number of Parts, which are different, and distinguish'd from the rest. The Means which ev'ry Poem uses to arrive at its Aim, are contained under the parts of Quality. 5\. To shew in what manner a Subject must be constituted to make a good Poem .] That is the Principal, and also the most Difficult. 6\. To forget nothing which concerns this Art .] The Greek has it thus. Of all that which is of this Method. Method has often been used for Art , and with reason; for he that speaks of Method , speaks of establish'd Rules, and a way mark'd out, whereby we may certainly arrive at what we seek for, and this is, what we call Art. 7\. I shall imitate Nature, and begin with the first strokes .] For Nature always begins with that which is the foundation of the rest, and postpones Effects to their Causes. 8\. Epopoeia and Tragedy .] According to the Plan he lays down, he first explains what Poesie is in general; that 'tis an Imitation. This is the Genus , which contains all the Species of what sort soever they be. 9\. Dithyrambicks .] None can doubt that an Epick Poem, Tragedy and Comedy, are only pure Imitations. But what can be the reason that Aristotle takes in also Dithyrambick Poesie ? Is it to Contradict Plato , who assures us, in his Third Book of a Common-wealth, That Dithyrambicks are without Imitation, because 'tis a simple Repetition of what the Poet sang, in Honour of Bacchus ? What Expedient is there to reconcile these two differing Opinions? The Expedient is not so very difficult to be found. Plato speaks of an exact and strict Imitation, which sets forth, and exposes to the Eyes of the Spectators, the Subject which is treated of. For Example: All that Homer makes Chryses speak, in the First Book of his Iliads , is an exact Imitation, because he lays aside the Person of the Poet, and puts on that of an Actor, which he imitates, when he Acts and Speaks, But if instead of making Chryses appear, he had been pleased to relate only his Words, and tell us, That Chryses desir'd the Atrides to send back his Daughter ,  &c. It had been a simple Narration, without that exact Imitation, which is the Life of Tragedy. Notwithstanding, altho' this be a Narration, yet we fail not to find Imitation in it, since every Narration has always some Object in view, which it proposes to Imitate, and make known; and consequently is an Imitation indirectly indeed, but 'tis an Imitation, and this way are Dithyrambicks contain'd under this Kind. Such was Plato's Opinion as well as Aristotle's , for they both agreed in this, That all Mens Actions were Imitations. 10\. Most of the Airs for the Flute, and Lessons for the Harp.] Aristotle has not only promis'd to treat of Poesie, and its different sorts; but is engaged also, to speak of whatever has relation to that Art; and by consequence, as Flutes and the Harp were used in Comedies, Tragedies, Odes, & c. they naturally fall under that Subject. Again, Musick is a Species of Poetry, as Poetry is a sort of Musick, and 'twas for this very Reason, that the Term Musick , was a general one among the Greeks , which comprehended not only Eloquence and Poetry, but Musick too. But this is not the chief Difficulty of this Passage. That consists, in finding the Reason, why Aristotle said, Most of the Airs for the Flute and Harp ? Was it because all the Airs for these Instruments were not Imitations? No, without doubt. The Players on the Flute and Harp, play often on those Instruments, without Imitating any thing; that is to say, without Imitating any Action or Passion, as in Preludes; for their Notes are then rambling, and indeterminate Sounds, which can no more be called Imitations, than an inarticulate Voice, by which you can understand nothing. 11\. Are only pure Imitations .] Whatever employs means, to shew and represent any Subject, as naturally as may be, whether it does really exist, or no, is call'd Imitation . To the end therefore, that a thing may be call'd Imitation, 'tis necessary, that at the same time these four following things be seen: That which Imitates: that which is Imitated: the Instrument or Means which is made use of: and the Manner in which they are employ'd. 'Tis evident by this, that there is no Art or Trade whatsoever, which is not Imitation, since in all of them these four things are plainly distinguish'd. This may suffice, for the understanding Aristotles meaning, into which I have seen many learned and Ingenious Men, who were not able to penetrate. Those who have read Plato's Sophist , and his Third Book of a Republick , will easily comprehend, how all the Actions, Passions, and Discourses of Men, are only Imitations, and learn the Difference, that Philosopher makes between the true and the false ones. But that is not our Business. 12\. The first regards the Means .] For all Arts don't employ the same Means and Instruments, to make their Imitation: They Imitate, as Aristotle says, with things of different sorts. 13\. The second the Subject .] For one Imitates one thing, and another another. 14\. The third the Manner .] Ev'ry Art has its different manner of Imitating, they don't all Imitate after the same manner. 15\. As Painters imitate most things with Figures and Colours.] Aristotle would explain the first of the three Differences, which he has establish'd, viz . That of the Means or Instrument, and he renders it very plain, by a Comparison drawn from Painting, which uses Figures and Colours, to make its Imitation. 16\. Either by the Assistance of Art, or by Custom only, or by joyning both together .] The Manner of Reading this Passage, had render'd it so obscure, and difficult, that we must not wonder, if so many learned Men have labour'd in vain to explain it; it was read thus. ![](/images/inline/Ogk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ἕ ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . These by the Assistance of Art, these by Custom, the rest by Voice . I know very well, that the Voice is an Instrument made use of for some sort of Imitation, but it can in no wise enter into Painting, or have any Connexion with it. Aristotle writ, as 'tis in some Copies, ![](/images/inline/rbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , and the rest by them two ; that is, by Art, and Custom. We will now explain the Philosophers thought. There are Painters which imitate by the Rules of Art alone, and neglect to joyn that which is Natural, to the Knowledge they have of the Rules; their Pieces are in truth very just and regular, but they are insipid and flat, there are no Masterly and Bold Strokes. There are others who Imitate by Custom only, and following their own Genius , have accustom'd themselves to draw Representations of whatever they have seen, without having the least Knowledge of the Rules of Art. To conclude, There are some which joyn Usage to Art, and they are those who having no less Genius than Science , acquire such an expertness in their Works, that they become Originals, and capable of working up to Nature, when others only work by their Copies. This is, in my Opinion, the way to explain Aristotle's Thoughts; notwithstanding which, I still find a very great difficulty; for I must confess, I don't apprehend why this great Philosopher, who never writ any single Word unprofitably, should enter into the detail of these three Differences among Painters. I am willing to think, that the first Part, ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ,  , Those by Art , may be corrupted; and that Aristotle writ, ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , Those by Chance ; after this manner, he would have explain'd the Origine, Progress, and entire Establishment of Painting, which arose as Poetry and Eloquence did: Chance produc'd it, Custom maintain'd and strengthen'd it; afterwards Men joyning both together, and comparing the Effects, discover'd the reason of it, and on that establish'd the Rules which Constitute this Art. 17\. With Number, Discourse and Harmony .] Number or Rythm, signifies properly, a measur'd Cadence, or a regulated Movement. Plato in his 11th Book of Laws , ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif)  . Rythm or Number, is called the Order of Movement Discourse is a general Term, and comprehends either Prose or Verse. Harmony signifies in this Place, only Musick or Song. Plato says in the same Place, ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ὖ ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἅ ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ἅ ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ὄ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) .  . The Order of Sounds, which arises from the Mixture of sharp and grave Tones, is called Harmony. 18\. The playing on the Flute, the Harp, and if there be any other of the same Nature, as the Pipe.] Aristotle would not put the Pipe in the same Rank with the Flute and Harp, because 'tis not so Noble: 'Tis for this Reason he uses this Modification; And if there be any other, of the same Nature as the Pipe . So Plato makes no mention of it; when he speaks of Imitation with the Flute and Harp, and Longinus has followed his Example in his 32d Chapter. 19\.

He adds, That 'tis very difficult to distinguish the Number and Harmony , which are in Tunes without Words, to comprehend what they signifie, and whether they Imitate any thing that's worth the trouble to imitate. Plato condemns these Tunes without Words, for they leave the Understanding without Action, and 'tis to that the Poets ought to speak, to instruct, and reform it; for 'tis the Understanding alone, can comprehend Truth, or Regulate the Manners. 21\.

As the Word Ἔ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , signifies no less Prose than Verse, Aristotle could very properly comprehend under the Name of Epopoeia , or Epick Poem , Discourses in Prose, since they might in reality, be Epick Poems . Are not our Romances such? Aristotle proceeds to explain himself, and to tell us, why he was oblig'd to use it thus. 23\. Or is content with one only, as it has hitherto been.] Hexameter , or Heroick Verses, have been so much devoted to Epopoeia , that from Homer down to Aristotle , and from him, down to us, there has not been any Poet, who has endeavoured to mix any other sort with it. In the mean while, Aristotle very well observes, that such a Mixture would not destroy, the Epick Poem , for it is the Invention and Imitation, and not the Verse which makes the Poem. 24\. I give to the word Epopoeia, a very large Signification; for otherwise we should have no general Term, which would comprehend ,  &c.] This is, what oblig'd Aristotle to comprehend under the general Name of Epopoeia , all sorts of Poems, whether in Prose or Verse; and since all of them are only the same Imitations, 'tis proper to give them one and the same Name, by which you may know their Nature, and that is what no other Name can ever do. This Reasoning is very Just, but 'twas not understood. 25\. Comprehend the Farces of Sophron and Xenarchus.] Are Farces then declar'd to be Epick Poems? There is nothing strange in this, if we consider the Composition and Nature of this Poem, for 'tis an Imitation compounded of Narration and Action, and if we would rank this Species under its Genus , there is none will agree to it, but the general Name of Epopoeia. 26\.

This Opinion can never be maintain'd. Aristotle certainly speaks here, of the Dialogues of Plato , which he calls Socratick Discourses , because it is Socrates's Doctrine, which is there explain'd; and Socrates is introduc'd almost ev'ry where.

Aristotle informs us by these Words, That Alexamenes of Teos, made those Dialogues before Plato, and that he was the Inventer of 'em . There can be no further doubt then, but that these Dialogues were in Prose: That is without dispute. But may it not be objected, That these Dialogues are more like a Dramatick , than an Epick Poem? No surely; for according to Aristotle's Doctrine, Epopoeia , or Epick Poem, imitates by Discourse; but Dramatick by Number, Discourse and Harmony; and 'tis for this reason, the Ancients never compar'd Plato with Sophocles , nor Euripides with Homer. 29\. In Iambick, Elegiack, or any other sort of Verses .] For, once again, 'tis the Imitation, and not the Verse which makes the Poem. 30\. 'Tis true, Men often distinguish Poets by the difference of their Verse only .] This Passage has always appear'd very difficult, but I hope 'twill not be found so. Aristotle makes this Objection, as from those who would blame his Method, in comprehending under the general Name of Epopoeia, Farces , and the Dialogues of Socrates . What necessity was there of running to the general Term? Might not Poets be distinguish'd then, as they are now, by the Nature of their Verse, and some call'd Elegiack Poets , others Iambick Poets , and those who write Hexameters, Epick or Heroick Poets? Aristotle answers this Objection very well, and shews how ridiculous it is. 31\. Nay, they give the Name of an Epick or Heroick Poet, to him who treats of Natural Philosophy, or Physick, in Hexameters .] This is the Inconvenience into which they must necessarily fall. who will distinguish and characterize Poets by their Verses. They must be oblig'd to give the same Name to Empedocles and Homer , to Lucretius and Virgil ; and certainly this Inconvenience is greater, than that which follows, by distinguishing them according to the Kinds of their Imitation. 32\. Howbeit there is nothing common to Homer and Empedocles, but the Verse.] Empedocles was a Sicilian Poet , a great Naturalist and Physician. He wrote in Heroick Verse a Course of Natural Philosophy, a Treatise of Physick, and some Books of Expiations, in which he imitated Homer's Stile. He was Contemporary with Sophocles ; since therefore there is nothing but the Verse common to Homer and Empedocles, Aristotle had reason to say, That the latter ought rather to be called a Physician or Naturalist, than a Poet; and by consequence, whoever will Characterize a Poet by the Verse, and not Imitation, shall always be mistaken, nothing can be more clear than this reasoning; of which Plutarch understood the force, when he writ in his Treatise, How we ought to read the Poets: That there is no Poem, where there is no Fable: 'Tis for this reason, that the Verses of Empedocles, Parmenides, those of the Biting of Venemous Beasts, the Remedies of Nicander, the Sentences of Theognis, are only Discourses which have borrowed the Nobleness of Stile, and Measure of Syllables from Poetry, as a means to avoid the Baseness of Prose. 33\. In effect, if any one should think it adviseable to make a Poem of all the different sorts of Verse ,  &c.] He is not satisfy'd to expose the Ridiculousness of those who would distinguish and Name Poets according to their Verse, but shows, that it may so happen, that it cannot be done at all: For what Name can be given to that Poet, who mingles all sorts of Verse in his Poem; he is neither an Heroick, Elegaick , nor Iambick Poet , he must then be no Poet; and this is what can be maintain'd. 34\. As Cheremon made his Centaur.] Cheremon , was a Tragick Poet , and Socrates's Disciple. The Ancients cite many of his Pieces, as his Alphesibeus, Bacchus, Thystes, Io, Elysseia, Oenues, Blesseas , and Centaur.

I shall speak again of this Piece in the 25th Chapter. 35\. Dithyrambicks, Nomes .] He joyns Dithyrambicks and Nomes , because they were both Hymns, sang in the Honour of the Gods. The Nomes were for Apollo ; and the Dithyrambicks for Bacchus. Nome properly signifies, a Mode , or manner of Singing, according to a certain Law, and Rule, which ought never to be transgress'd. There's this difference betwixt the Nomes and Dithyrambicks , these were unruly and bold, and sang with the Phrygian Tone, those sweet and easie, and sang after the Lydian manner. 36\. With this difference, that some use them all together .] As Dithyrambicks and Nomes , whose Verses were always accompanied with Singing and Dancing. 37\. And others separately .] As Tragedy and Comedy, which employ'd only Verse in the Acts ; Dancing and Singing with the Verse in the Chorus , as you'll see in what follows. The Subjects of Imitation; their Difference, and what they produce in those who Imitate; and in their Imitation, the different Character of Homer, Cleophon, Hegemon, Nicochares. Timotheus and Philoxenus. 24 Actions, and 'tis  26 impossible but  27 Actions must be either good, or bad, for as Manners cannot be distinguish'd, but by these two Qualities, and Men differ among themselves only  28 as they are Vertuous or Vicious, it necessarily follows, that Poets in their Imitations must represent Men in respect to us, either better or worse, or just as we are.  29 'Tis the same of Painters. Thus Polygnotus painted Men better, Pauson worse, and Dionysius as they were: And it is evident, that these Differences are without fail, to be found in every one of the Imitations, of which we have spoke; which are different, as  30 the Subjects of which they treat are so  31 2\. The same Differences are also to be found in Dances, in the Airs for the Flute, Lessons for the Harp and all other Instruments, and in all Works whether in Prose or Verse. For Example: Homer has made Men better, Cleophon has made them such as they are, and Hegemon of Thasos , who invented Parodies , And Nicochare the Author of the Deliad , have made them worse. It is the same with those Poets, who have composed Dithyrambicks and Nomes. Thus it is that Timotheus and Philoxenus have imitated the Persians and Cyclops, in the Pieces, which bear those Names . And 'tis this, which makes the Difference between Tragedy and Comedy; for the first  32 represents them better and the latter  33 worse. 1\. As all those who Imitate, Imitate Actions.] Aristotl . lays down this as an undoubted Principle; and indeed it is so, for there is nothing else but Actions which can be imitated. 2\. For Manners cannot be distinguish'd, but by these two Qualities .] The Philosopher expresses himself more Pathetically, in the Original; for says he, Manners are not found but in these that are such : which is as much as to say, that properly speaking, there are no Manners, in any, but those who are good, or bad. If there were any, that kept a Medium between both, we could not properly say of them that they had manners, at least they would not be perceptible, and consequently, could not be the Subject of an imitation; but true Philosophy proves, that all is Virtue, or Vice; so that this Medium can't be found. 3\. In respect to us, either better, or worse, or just as we are .] 'Tis impossible to Conceive any other Qualifications, than these three. If Poets keep to an exact imitation, of the Ages in which they live, they make Men like themselves, that is, such as they really are; if they add any thing to their Virtue, they make them better, that is greater, more Virtuous and Heroick; if they retrench anything, or aggravate their Faults, they make them more wicked. Because the second Imitation is Capable of giving a Noble Emulation to Mankind, and to lead them to Virtue. The Thebans made a Law, which oblig'd Poets, and Painters, to represent Men better, than they were; and those who made them worse, were severely fin'd. 4\. Polygnotus painted Men better.] Ælian Confirms the judgment of Aristotle ; for he says that Polygnotus always painted Noble Subjects, and that he hit the features to Perfection; and that Dionysius imitated him in ev'ry thing but the size. ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . Polygnotus was of the Isle of Thasos , and Dionysius of Colophon , they both liv'd in the Ninetieth Olympiad , in the times of Xerxes, Sophocles , and Socrates. Polygnotus painted, in the Gallery called Poikile , the Battle of Marathon , gain'd by Miltiades , over the Medes and Persians. 5\. Pauson worse .] Perhaps this is the same, which Pliny calls Pausias ; he was of Sicyonia , and the first, that painted Ceilings, La[illeg.]naria. Ælian calls him Pauson , as Aristotle does, and tells this Story of him. A certain Man, would have him draw a Picture of an Horse, wallowing, and rowling, on the Ground, he drew one running full speed; and when the Man, for whom the Picture was drawn, refus'd to have it, because, he would have had an Horse rowling and not running; Pauson said to him, Do but turn the Picture upside-down, and the Horse which is now running will then be rowling . The Ancients use to Compare Socrates Writings, to this Painting of Pauson's , for to find what you look for, you must not take them, as he gives 'em; but turn, and take them the Contrary way. Æ lian Book the xiv. Chap. xv. 6\. The same differences are also to be found, in Dances, in the Ayres for the Flute, and Lessons for the Harp ,  &c.] For Dancers, and Players on Instruments, must represent Men, either, better, or worse; or alike; having no other qualities which they can make the Subjects of their Imitation. 7\. And in all Workes whether in Prose or Verse .] The Greek says in Di[illeg.] ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , alluding, to the Socratick Dialogues, of which we have already spoken; and in Psylometry , that is, in those Works, which are pure Verse; and where there is neither Dance, nor Song, as in an Epick Poem. The Interpreters continue here in the same fault which they were in before. 8\. For Example , Homer made men better .] For no Man is so Brave as Achilles , so Prudent as Ulysses ,  &c. and somebody spake very aptly, to this purpose, when he said, That Homer made Gods of his Men, and Men of his Gods. 9\. Cleophon has made them such as they are.] Cleophon the Athenian Poet. Suidas has preserved the Names of a great many Tragedies which he writ; as Acteon, Achilles; Telephus, Bacchantes ,  &c. And this Passage of Aristotle seems to prove that he also made some Epick Poem. 10\. Hegemon of Thasos, who invented Parodies.] Atheneus speaks of this Hegemon , and quotes some places of his Parodies ; but denies, that he was the Inventor of them, and attributes that to Hipponax , who was before Hegemon . It may be, the term which Aristotle uses, ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , who first made them , may not signify, that he found them out, but that he made them best. We certainly find, that Hegemon was the first, who enter'd the Lists of the Publick Shows at Athens , for Parodies , and who won the Prize. Epicharmus, Cratinus , and Hermippus , Poets who made the old Comedy, made also Parodies ; but they came not near those of Hegemon ; for besides his lucky hits, he was an incomparable Actor, and diverted the Athenians so much, that one day, when he recited his Gigantomachia , they were so pleas'd, and laugh'd so heartily, that tho' the News came of the Defeat of their Army in Sicily , they could not leave off. And if Hegemon had not given over, they would have staid there, till the end, as much for the Pleasure they took in hearing it, as for Shame to shew their Concern, before those Strangers who came from all the adjoyning Towns to see that Show. After Hegemon , appear'd Euboeus of Paros , and Boeotus , who surpassed all that ever were before them; The first, who liv'd in the time of Philip , made Parodies against the Athenians , and there were remaining in the second Century, four entire Books of 'em. 11\. Parodies .] A sort of Poem, in which another Poets Verses were ridicul'd, by making some little change. This was Parodie in its original. The Authors of these Poems, as Aristotle observes of Hegemon , made Men worse, than they really were; for that was the only aim of Parodies . Afterwards they made serious Parodies ; but I believe, they were not known to the Ancients, or at least, I have seen no Example that they were. 12\. Nicochares Author of the Deliad.] Nicochares a Comick Poet of Athens . He liv'd in the time of Aristophanes , who Banter'd him, in some of his Pieces. The Ancients cite many Comedies of his, Amymone, Pelops, Galatea , The Marriage of Hercules, Hercules Choragus , The Cretians , The Lacedemomians , The Lemnians , The Centaurs . The Deliad which Aristotle quotes here, seems to have been a sort of Burlesque Poem, in which he ridicul'd the Manners of the Delians. 13\. It is the same with those Poets, who have Composed Dithyrambicks and Nomes.] Since Dithyrambicks were Poems in Honour of Bacchus , and Nomes in that of Apollo , how could it possibly be, that a Poet should represent, Men better or worse. Tho' this difficulty seems Considerable, yet it will soon vanish, when we are inform'd, That in them were sung the Actions of those whom they would praise, or blame. 14\. Thus it is that Timotheus, and Philoxenus, have imitated the Persians and Cyclops.] Timotheus of Miletum , a great Poet; He composed Eighteen Books of Nomes , Abundance of Dithyrambicks , and a great many other Works. He added two Strings to the Harp, the Eleventh and the Twelfth, and improv'd the Ancient Musick. He liv'd in the time of Euripides . In some of his Nomes , he sung the Victory, which the Athenians obtain'd over the Persians , and to heighten the value of it, he made the Persians much more Valiant, than really they were. This is the reason why Aristotle says, that in Nomes Men may be describ'd to be better than they are. The Antients quote Timotheus's Cyclops also. 15\. Philoxenus .] Is the Famous Dithyrambick Poet, who liv'd in Plato's time, and Dionysius the Tyrant, against whom he made his Cyclops , or under the feign'd Names of Polyphemus and Galatea described the Amours of that Prince. Atheneus quotes one place of the Cyclops , and finds fault, that Polyphemus , in praising Galatea's Beauty, takes no notice of her Eyes, which is the Part Lovers, generally, and most voluntarily praise, he says 'tis a blind Praise . I believe that Polyphemus , said nothing of Galatea's Eyes; because without doubt he thought it a Deformity to have two Eyes, and that 'twas better to have but one, as we have but one Mouth: As for what remains, Aristotle proves, that this Poem of Philoxenus , was a Piece of Dithyrambick[illeg.] , and not a Comedy. 16\. And 'tis this which makes the difference which is between Tragedy and Comedy .] Since he comes so directly to Tragedy and Comedy, 'tis to me a clear Proof, that they are deceiv'd, who take the Cyclops , and Persians (of which we have spoke) for Pieces of the Theatre. 17\. For the first represents Men better ] For Tragedy, is the imitation, of great Persons Actions, and whose Actions it represents, still greater than they are, making them, however, somewhat like, as shall be explain'd elsewhere. 18\. And the latter worse .] This agrees only to the old, and Mean Comedy, which represented Men worse for the New endeavour'd to make them like. Menander and Terence , have drawn Men very Naturally. Our Comedies have in many things Chosen the Manner of the two first. The Manner how Imitations are made. The difference it puts between the Subjects it treats of. How far Sophocles represented Homer, and Aristophanes. The Pretences of the Dorians against the Athenians, on account of Tragedy and Comedy. 1\. The Third Difference  34 consists in the manner, in which these Imitations are made; for the same Subjects, may be imitated with the same things, and yet be render'd very different , by the manner of doing it; either in making a Narration, or acting some other Person, as Homer has successfully Practis'd; either without shifting the Person , and remaining still the same, or  35 by always making those act, which we imitate. 2\. All That, which is call'd Imitation, is Capable of those three  36 Differences only, of which I have spoke in the beginning, and which I shall explain , under these three words, With What, What , and How . So that in the second respect, Sophocles , is  37 like Homer , in his Imitation, for they both imitate the most Considerable Men; and in the third, he is like Aristophanes ; because he imitates those who act, and also in their Acting, as he does.  38 'Tis for this reason, some have maintain'd that the Pieces for the Theatre ,  39 were called Dramatick , from the word Drama which signifies an Action. That which gave occasion, to the Dorians , to attribute to themselves the Invention of Tragedy, and Comedy. For the Megarians of that Country, took Comedy, for their share, pretending, that it had its Original, in their Popular State. The Megarians of Sicily , also claim'd it, because the Poet Epicharmus , was elder than Chionides , and Magnes , who was a Sicilian. 40 Some of  41 the Dorians , in the Peloponesus, have attributed both to themselves , and found their Pretensions on the Names. And first as for Comedy , they assert that the Villages, which the Athenians call Demoi , they call Comai , which proves, say they , that Comedy, was not so called from the word Comazein ,  42 as the the Athenians pretend, to get this Honour ; but from the word Come , Village, because  43 the first Comedians not being allow'd to enter the Cities, went and acted in the Villages. They assert also, that as the Athenians say Prattein to do, or act, they say Dran , from whence proceeded the Name, given to all Pieces of the Theatre, which are called Dramatick, Dramas, that is Actions . This suffices for, the Differences of Imitation, their Number, and Nature. 1\. The Third Difference consists, in the Manner, in which these Imitations are made .] After having spoke of the Subjects of Imitation, and the Means which are there employ'd, he comes to the third Difference, he hath establish'd; that is, the Manners which are used, in imitating; for tho' Imitations may be alike, as to the Matter, and Means; yet they may be different, as to the Manner, and this is what he goes on to explain. 2\. Either in making a Narration, or in acting some other Person .] This Passage appears a little difficult, for Aristotle says here in three Lines, what Plato has fill'd three Pages with, in the Third Book of his Republick . We'll endeavour to explain it, Epick, Dithyrambick , and Dramatick Poems, do all three imitate the same Subjects, for they imitate Actions, they all employ the same Means, that is Verse. From whence then proceeds the Difference between them? 'Tis after this manner: In an Epick Poem, sometimes the Poet makes a Simple Narration, sometimes he personates another; thus his Poem is composed of Narration and Action. This is what Aristotle means, when he says, Either in making a Narration, or acting some other Person ; this is the first manner of making an Imitation. The second is, when the entire Poem, is only a Narration, as a Dithyrambick Poem, where the Poet always relates, without acting at all, and this is the meaning of those words, Either without shifting the Person, and remaining still the same ; for 'tis a continued Narration, when the Poet remains always such. To conclude, the third is, when the Poem always Employs action, as Tragedy, and Comedy, for 'tis not the Poet who then speaks, 'tis the Actor , who explains in Acting, what the Poet meant ; and this is what Aristotle would have understood by these words, or by always making those act, which we imitate . These three Differences, are evidently explain'd, at the end of that Passage of Plato's , which I mention'd. I think I have plainly enough expounded to you, what I would have you understand, That Poesy, or Fable, consists in a continu'd Imitation, as in Tragedy, and Comedy; or in the Narration of the Poet, as in Dithyrambicks; or else in both, that is in Narration, and Imitation, or Action, as in an Epick Poem, and some other Works of that Nature. 3\. Which I shall explain under these three words .] These are the three essential Differences, established, between all Arts, in,  &c. the first Chapter, with what , regards the Means; what , regards the Subject; and how , regards the Manner. 4\. So that in the second respect , Sophocles is like Homer in his Imitation.] Homer , and Sophocles are alike, in the second respect, because they both imitate, the same Subjects, that is those who act, but they differ, in respect, of the other two, for they imitate neither after the same Manner, nor with the same Means, Homer employing only Verse; but Sophocles , Verse, Singing, Dancing. 5\. In the third he is like Aristophanes.] For he imitates after the same Manner, that is, with Action, but they differ in the quality of the Subjects, they imitate. 6\. 'Tis for this reason, some have maintained, that the Pieces for the Theatre, were call'd Dramatick, from the word Drama, which signifies an Action .] It seems that Aristotle was not very far from believing, that they might be called Dramatick , for some other reason; for the word Drama, Drame , may be Synonymous to Poem, and signify Composition only; But the first Derivation, is the most probable. 7\. For the Megarians of that Country .] That is, the true Megarians , in the Neighbourhood of Athens ; for there were other Megarians , in Sicily , which descended from the former, as shall be shewn hereafter. They were all Dorians. 8\. Pretending that it had its Original from their popular State.] Megara , was a true Democracy. And 'tis certain, that Comedy could never be produc'd, under any other Government than that of the People; Considering how free it was in its beginning. 9\. The Megarians of Sicily have also Claim'd it.] Strabo writes, that one Theocles an Athenian , having gathered together a great number of Ionians, Dorians , and Calchidians which liv'd in Euboea , of which the greatest part belonged to Megara , went into Sicily , that the Chalchidians built Naxus , and the Dorians Megara , and consequently were a Colony of the Megarians of Greece. Thucidides calls the chief of the Colony of the Megarians, Lamii. 10\. Because the Poet Epicharmus, was elder than Chionides, and Magnes, who was a Sicilian.] This Testimony of Aristotle , concerning the Antiquity of Epicharmus , is very remarkable, if Epicharmus be elder than Chionides , and Magnes , then he liv'd before Eschylus ; for it agrees, with what Suidas relates, that Magnes appear'd, at the latter end of Epicharmus's time. As for what remains, Aristotle only relates the Peoples Pretentions, without passing his Judgment. But what if Thespis was elder than Epicharmus ? Why, if so, the Athenians would certainly have the Advantage. 11\. Some Dorians of the Peloponesus.] The Dorians were those People, who dwelt round about Parnassus ; They had at first but four Cities, which were called the Dorians Tetrapolis , viz. Cytinum, Eryneum, Beon , and Pindus : but by degrees they extended themselves, as far as Megara ; for Strabo counts Megara among the Dorian Towns, as we have already seen. To Conclude, Four and twenty Years after the Trojan War. they, together with the Heraclides , took Possession of the Peloponesus ; thus Aristotle speaks of the Dorians , of the Peleponesus. 12\. They assert that the Villages, which the Athenians call Demoi, they call Comai.] This would Conclude nothing in favour of the Dorians , if it were true; for Tragedy was a long time, the General Name, for Tragedy, and Comedy both; so it might have been in Attica , a great while, before the Dorians , of Peleponesus , gave it the Name of Comedy. 13\. Which proves , say they, that Comedy, was not so called, from the word Comazein, as the Athenians pretend .] The Athenians , to overthrow the Arguments the Dorians draw from the word Comai , urge that the Original of the name Comedy, was found among them, and that 'was so call'd, from the Verb Comazein ; which signifies properly, to go mask'd thro' the Streets, Singing, and Dancing. The Etymology which the Dorians give, seems indeed more probable, than that of the Athenians ; for how can Comodein , be made of the word Comazein . The Analogy won't bear; it seems indeed more likely, that ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , comes from ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ἆ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , to sing to the God Comus: but 'tis not decent, for me to determine, that, which Aristotle has thought fit to leave Undecided. 14\. Because the first Comedians, not being allow'd to enter the Cities ,] For as Aristotle says, in what follows, The Athenian Magistrates were very late, e're they gave Liberty to the Acting of those Pieces. 15\. They Assert also, that as the Athenians say Prattein to do, they say Dran.] This Concludes only for the General Appellation, but nothing for Tragedy in particular, which was so called, either from ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif)  , The Goats Song ; Because as Horace says in his Art of Poetry , that was the Prize of Tragedy. Carmine qui Tragico vilem certavit ob Hircum , Who strove in Tragedy, for a vile Goat, Or from ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif)  , The Vintage Song ; because they were invented at that time: Or from ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif)  , The Song of Lees ; because the Actors besmear'd their Faces with the Lees of Wine. Horace. Qui Canerent, agerentq; peruncti f aecibus ora. Who Act, and Sing, with Faces all besmear'd, With Lees of Wine.--- 16\. This suffices for the Differences of Imitation, their Number, and Nature .] This is the Summary, of all which Aristotle has said, in the three first Chapters; he explains the Essential Differences, Number, and Nature, which are to be found, in whatever is call'd Imitation. The Causes of Poetry. Imitation is as natural to Men, as Number and Harmony. Whence it proceeds, that Painting gives so much Pleasure. The First Essays of Poetry. How it chang'd its Form. Elogy of Homer. What Poem his Margites was. Poets divided into two Classes . Homer first made Dramatick Imitations for Tragick and Comick Poetry, and open'd the way to all Poets. The Origine of Tragedy and Comedy. The encrease of the first, and by what degrees, it came to the Perfection it is now at. From whence it proceeded that 'twas so long e'er it obtained the Loftiness which is proper to it. The first Verses which were made use of, and the reason they were afterwards chang'd. produced Poetry:  44 The first is Imitation, a quality born with Men, for they differ from other Creatures, by the great  45 desire they have for Imitation, and 'tis by its means, that they learn the first Elements of Sciences, and  46 that all their Imitations give them a peculiar Pleasure; As we may see ev'ry day , when we view Pictures: Some Originals, as terrible Beasts, dead, or dying Men, which we hardly dare look on, as they naturally are, or at least not without Fear, and Horror, we behold very agreeably in Paintings, and we see them, with so much the more Pleasure, as they resemble their Originals. The reason of this is, That not only Philosophers, have a desire to learn, but the same Passion, is equally natural, to all Men; tho' all cannot be Equally inform'd. 'Tis this which makes them behold Pictures with so much Satisfaction, because they are capable of reasoning, and being inform'd, by looking on them. For Example, When they see a Picture of a Man they know , they say, 'tis such an one ; and if 'tis the Pourtrait of one, they never saw, the Pleasure they then have, does not proceed from the Exactness of the Imitation, but from the Art, or the Mixture and Vivacity of the Colours, or from something else which draws their Eyes and Attention 2\. If Imitation is Natural to us, Number and Harmony are not less so; under Number I comprehend Verse also, which is evidently one part of it: and these are the two Canses which have produced Poetry.  47 For those who had the greatest Genius for these, gave it Birth by degrees; by some Extempore Essays: But it soon  48 chang'd its form, according to the several Inclinations of Poets; for those who had the most Sublime Genius, Sang the Actions of Great Persons.  49 Those who had a meaner, made the Adventures of the worst of Men the Subjects of their Songs, of whom they made  50 provoking Railleries, as the first made Panegyricks, and Hymns. 3\. There remains  51 no Poem of this Sort, before Homers , tho' there is a great deal of Probability that there were many. But we have some of his time, for Example, his Margites, and  52 many others of the same Species, in which Iambick Verses were made use of, as the most proper for Raillery and Reproach ; for this reason those Poems are now called Iambick Poems, from the name of the Verse , which is nothing else but continual Invectives.  53 Thus the first Poets, were divided, into two Sects, for one made Heroick Verses and the other Iambick. And thus Homer, without Contradiction , deserves the first place in the Heroick, and Tragick kind; for he alone deserves the Name of a Poet, not only because he has wrote well; but also, because he has made Dramatick Imitations; He was also the first, who gave us as it were the Sketches of Comedy, by Converting into Pleasantry, the biting reproaches of former Poets. And truly his Margites has the same  54 relation to Comedy, as his Ilias and Odysses have to Tragedy. The Poets who came after him , were naturally carried to one or other of these sorts of Poetry, and according as they had more, or less Inclination, some set themselves to make Comedies, instead of Iambicks; while others left Heroicks to give us Tragedies: Those two sorts of Work, appearing more Noble, and worthy of their Labour. 4\. Tis not proper to examine in this place whether Tragedy be now in its Perfection, and whether it has received, that form, which is agreeable, both to it self, and to the Theatre. 5\. Tragedy then, and Comedy, being thus produc'd Extempore, as I have said ; for the first sow'd its Origine to the Dithyrambicks , sung in Praise of Bacchus , and the other to  55 Obscene Songs , which are now at this time Sung in several Towns, being authoriz'd by Custom , and the Laws, both one and t'other, encreased by little and little, ev'ry one adding somewhat to their Beauty, as they discover'd  56 ; what was agreeable to their Character. 6\. After Tragedy had received a great many Changes, and acquir'd all which was proper for it, it stopt.  57 Æ schylus was the first who brought two Actors on the Stage, for before him there was only one ; he shorten'd the Songs of the Chorus, and invented the Idea of the Principal Character. Sophocles 58 added a third Actor, to Æschylus's two , and adorned the Scenes with fine Decorations. In short, 'twas late, e'er it received, that Gravity and Grandeur, which are Convenient for it, for 'twas not easily rid , of  59 those insignificant Subjects,  60 Burlesque Stile, which it retain'd of those Satyrical Pieces, from whence it came. 7\. The Trimeter Iambicks succeeded the Tetrameter, which were always us'd, because they were Satyrical, and full of Motion and Dances. But after the Diction, that was proper for it, was  61 establish'd, That sort of Verse which was most agreeable, was found out Naturally, and without any trouble , for Iambicks are of all sorts of Verse, the most proper for Conversation; this is a certain Sign of it, that we often make Iambicks, in talking to one another, and very rarely Hexameters, which almost never come from us , but when we  62 pass the bounds of ordinary Discourse, and change the Harmony and Tone. 8\. The Number of Episodes, encreased also with time , as all the other beauties of Tragedy  63 did, successively, and by degrees. But it may suffice to have spoken of them in General; for it would be too difficult and tedious an Undertaking, to treat of ev'ry one in particular. 1\. There are two different Causes, and both very Natural, which seem to have produc'd Poetry .] 'Tis not sufficient, for us to have been taught, that Poetry is an Imitation, but we must learn what it is, which gave occasion to this Imitation, and how it was produc'd; this is what Aristotle does here, whose Modesty we shall do well to take notice of; for he asserts nothing, and is content to say, that It seems , for he had been rash, to ascertain a true Origine of a thing so Ancient, and which can only be known by simple Conjectures, which however true they may seem, don't always lead to the truth. This Philosopher has had the Misfortune, not to be understood, tho' he has express'd himself very clearly in this Chapter; for People have comprehended only, the first of these two Causes, and been very much deceiv'd in the latter. 2\. For they differ from other Creatures by the great desire they have for Imitation .] The Greek says in that, they are very imitating ; and Aristotle uses the Superlative, because, there are other Creatures, which are naturally inclin'd to Imitation, as Dawes, Munkeys,  &c. but that Imitation is only Superficial, Particular, and Casual, when that of Men, is Solid, General, and has sure Principles. 3\. And 'tis by its Means that they learn the first Elements of Sciences .] 'Tis by imitation only, that Children learn any thing, as to Walk, Speak,  &c. and 'tis for this reason Horace says, Reddere qui voces Jam scit Puer. The Child who has already learn'd to talk. But I believe that Aristotle speaks here of Fable, in particular, with which the Greeks began the Education of their Children: There is a very fine passage of this in the First Book of Strabo. First of all , says he, The Poets are not the only People, who have received Fables, for Cities and Legislators did it a long time before them, by reason of the Advantage which arose from them, and Conformity to the natural Inclination of a reasonable Creature. For Man loves to learn, and Fable opens the Way: And 'tis by this Way that Children, begin to listen to what is said to them, and to take notice of it. The reason of it is this, Fable is a new Story, not of what is really, but of somewhat quite different, now nothing is so agreeable as what is new, and unknown; and this is the reason too, why we love Sciences. If to Fable, we add the Wonderful, and Prodigious, it infinitely increases the Pleasure; which is the only Charm, that makes us desirous to hear it. It is necessary to use this Artifice at first, to allure Children: when they are advanced in Age, and their reason grows Stronger, and there is no further occasion to Caress, and Flatter them, than we must introduce them into the true Sciences, and let them know things as they are ,  &c. 4\. And that all their Imitations, give them a peculiar Pleasure .] The most learned Interpreters of Aristotle , have committed a very considerable Fault here, in taking these words, for an Explication, of the Second Cause, which he gives of Poetry; as if Aristotle had said: And the Second, that all their Imitations, give them a peculiar Pleasure. Aristotle was not Capable of Saying such a Nonsensical thing, and to attribute to one Effect, two Causes, which are one and the same. It is as if we should say, there are two Causes which make a Plant grow, that a Gardiner has set; one the wat'ring it, and the other the Pleasure he takes in wat'ring it; Sure this must appear absurd to ev'ry body. This Philosopher says then, that the first Cause of Poesy is Imitation, to which Men are naturally carried ; and as that Inclination, however Natural it is, would be useless to Men, unless they had the Pleasure of exercising it; he adds, and in which they take a peculiar Delight , But still this makes only one, and the same Cause; the Second shall be explain'd in the Ninth Remark. 5\. Some Originals, as terrible Beasts, Dead, or Dying Men, which we hardly dare look on as they Naturally are, yet at least, not without fear, and horror, we behold very agreeably in Paintings .] There is nothing so ugly, or so horrible, but looks pleasant in a Picture; 'tis not that the thing is fine in it self, for what is ugly, cannot be fine; but it is, because there is nothing so agreeable as Imitation. 'Tis on this account, that the Poets in all times, have chosen, what was most Horrible, for the Subjects of their Descriptions. Nicomachus represented Medea killing her Children, and Theon painted Orestes murd'ring Clytemnestra . We have some Pieces of Modern Painters, on these frightful Subjects; we look on them with Delight, but don't by that, praise the Actions which they imitate; but the Art, which knew how to imitate these Actions so happily. It is the same of Poetry. We are pleased to see the Descriptions of those things, that we could not look on as they are in Nature. If Philoctetes should appear to us in the Condition Sophocles represents him, we should endeavour to avoid him; but the Imitation he makes, attracts and charms us. 6\. The reason of this is, that not only Philosophers have a desire to learn, but the same Passion is equally Natural to all Men .] Men being endow'd with Reason, and naturally loving Arts, take a singular Delight, in seeing any thing that is made by Art and Reason. Both one and t'other are found in Imitation. And therefore 'tis, that it has the advantage over Truth it self, which appears simple, ordinary and common, when Subtilty and Industry, are joyned to Truth, in an exact and [illeg.]u[illeg.]y Imitation. 'Tis that which gives to the Mind an occasion of reasoning, and making reflexions, insomuch that it always apprehends something new, as Aristotle himself teaches, in the 11th Chapter of his Rhetorick, where he shows, that the pleasure we have in seeing a Curious Imitation, doth not arise from the beauty of the Original, which is imitated; but from this, that the Mind thereby, finds means, to Consider, and inform it self. 'Twas from this truth also, that the Cyrenaick Philosophers, drew this Argument to Convince the Epicureans , that the Pleasure we take in any Object, does not proceed from the Seeing, or Hearing, but from the Understanding which Apprehends, and Judges. 7\. Tho all cannot be equally inform'd .] These words are difficult to be understood, tho' I believe this is the sense of them, ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif)  altho' they partake little of it , that is, altho', they are not all equally proper to be inform'd , for some learn better than others, in proportion to the Ingenuity they have. The Will is equal in all, but the Power is not so. 8\. The Pleasure they have does not proceed from the exactness of the Imitation, but from the Art, or the mixture, and vivacity of the Colours .] For none Can judge of the Exactness of an Imitation, who knows not the Original, which is imitated. But as Aristotle says, the Pleasure we then have, proceeds from the Beauty of the Piece, or from the Vivacity, and Mixture of the Colours, or from the Choice of the Action, or from the Posture of the Persons, or something else, which in attracting the Eyes, exercises and instructs the Mind whilst it diverts it. 9\. If Imitation is Natural to us, Number and Harmony is not less so .] After having explain'd the first Cause of Poetry, he Comes to the second, which is Number and Harmony; for whatever Inclination, Men may have had to Imitation, yet they had never invented Poesy, if they had not been as much Inclin'd, to what Aristotle here calls Number and Harmony , that is, Cadence, and Song, this is very plain. 10\. Under Number, I Comprehend Verse also, which is evidently one part of it .] For truly, there is no Verse without number; but there are Numbers, or Rythms without Verse. 11\. For these who had the greatest Genius for theft .] For these two Causes, ( viz .) for Imitation, and Number and Harmony; Imitation, without Number and Harmony, Could never have produced Poetry, any more than Number and Harmony, without Imitation. 12\. Gave it birth by degrees, by some extempore Essays . For Poesy being produc'd, in the Assemblies which the first Men, (who were either Shepheards, or Labourers.) had in Honour of the Gods, after their Vintage, it was not the effect of Study; but Nature excited with Joy and Wine. In a word, the first rough Draughts of Poetry, were extempore; you may see what has been remark'd, on the 144th Verse of the First Epistle the 11th Book of Horace. 13\. But it soon changed its form, according to the several Inclinations of the Poets.] Aristotle explains the origine, and progress of Poetry, in an admirable Method. 'Twas at first, some gross Extempore-pieces, where Satyr and Panegyrick were mixt; but it was soon divided into two Sects , if I may use that word. Those who had the largest Capacities, Sang the Praies of the Gods, and Heroes; those who had less, amused themselves in making Satyrical Pieces. We may take notice, En passant , of this Judgment of Aristotles , who clearly determines that there is requir'd a greater Genius to Praise, than to Slander; and for this reason calls those who spend their time in making Hymns and Panegyricks ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , more grave, and lofty ; and the others ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , more low, and debas'd. 14\. There remains no Poem of this sort .] That is any of these last Poems, which were fill'd, with raillery; and it seems by this, that there were some of the first sort in Aristotle's time, It having had more respect for grave, and serious Works, than for those Railleries, and Satyrs, it would be the quite contrary now adays, she should rather preserve the Railleries, and Satyrs, than the serious, and grave Pieces. 15\. For example his Margites .] Which was the Name of a Man, who was neither Labourer, Husbandman, nor Shepheard, and who knew not how to do any thing. Wherefore Homer made a Poem against him, and call'd it after his Name. 16\. In which Iambick Verses were made use of as the most proper for Raillery .] This Expression of Aristotle , deserves to be examined; word for word 'tis thus. In which Poems, the Iambick also enter as being suitable . This gives us to understand, that these Poems were not entirely Compos'd, of Iambicks , and that it is was not the most frequent neither; and that is true. Iambicks were also scatter'd up and down in Heroick Poems, without observing any order, or distance; as Hephestion has taught us in his little Treatise of Poetry; where he says, as in the Homer's Margites, when Iambicks, are mixt with the Heroick Verse . It was not long in Use, for the Poets soon appropriated, the Heroick to Panegyricks and Hymns, and the Iambick, to reproach and Invective, 17\. For this reason those Poems are call'd Iambick Poems, from the Name of the Verse .] It appears by this, that the Name of Iambick Poems , was not given to the Satyrical Poems, till after a considerable time; and very probably, not till Iambick Verses were entirely left off. 18\. Which is nothing else but Continual Invectives .] For the Greek word Iambizein signifies to speak Injuriously. 19\. And thus Homer, without Contradiction, deserves the first place, in the Heroick, and Tragick kind .] He hath already said, that those, who had the most extensive Genius, set themselves to write of the Actions of their Gods and Heroes, and that others amus'd themselves in making Satyrs, He proceeds to show, that Homer had the most elevated Genius, that he apply'd himself, to grave, and serious matters, which he calls ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , and which I have translated, the Heroick and Tragick Kind : For 'tis that, which is Noblest, and that is what Aristotle mean't. 20\. He alone deserves the Name of a Poet, not only because he has wrote well .] This Encomium which Aristotle here gives is the most Nice, and Judicious Criticism, that ever was, 'tis very remarkable, that he allows Homer , to have written perfectly well, which was never Contested by any body yet. There are some slight Faults found in his Works, but none ever said that he did not write well. On the Contrary, all agree, that he wrote better than other Poets, and that his Stile is more animated, and sprightly. 21\. But also because he made Dramatick Imitations .] The Ilias, and Odysses may pass, for true Tragedies, by reason of the Action, the Disposition, and the Management of the Subject, the admirable mixture of Episodes , the Nature of the Catastrophe and the liveliness of the Passions, for all these, are eminently in those Poems, as well as in Tragedy; for which reason Plato was not Content, to call Epick Poems Tragedies, but says, that Homer was not only the greatest, but the first of Tragick Poets. In his Theaitet : and in the Tenth Book of his Republick. 22\. He was also the first who gave us as it were the sketches of Comedy, by Converting into Pleasantry the biting reproaches of former Poets.] Homer's Genius was as pleasant, and agreeable, as it was lofty, and capable of Succeeding, in great Subjects, which lead him to discover the Idea of Comedy. He only chang'd the bitter Invectives of those second Poems, we spake off, into Raillery and Joke, for he was Incapable of imitating any gross or brutal Obscenity. Plato writes in the Third Book of his Commonwealth. That tho' a Man may be able, to make two different Imitations, yet he cannot do it so easily, in two things which nearly approach one another, as Tragedy and Comedy. Nevertheless, Homer overcame that difficulty, by inventing the Ideas of both; but Plato speaks only of these two Poems when they are entire and perfect, and Informs us that from Homer down to his time, there were no Poets, who would make Tragedy and Comedy both, were ever happy in their Imitations. If we should run thro' all the Ages since Plato down to our times, we should find none that have succeeded better. 'Tis very difficult, not to say impossible, and our greatest Poets are very sensible of it. 23\. And truly his Margites has the same relation to Comedy, as his Ilias and Odysses have to Tragedy .] I admire, that after this Judgment of Aristotle , any Criticks should write, that the Ilias was a Model of Tragedy, and the Odysses of Comedy, for nothing can be less true. The Ilias and Odysses , both for the Subject, and Manner, are the same sort of Poem; one sings Achilles's Anger, and the other Ulysses's Prudence. they both employ the same means, and after the same manner. The most the Odysses could do was to give an Idea of Satyr, as of Euripides his Cyclops, but besides its being only an Episode, and not the principal Action, it was a truely Tragical Piece, as I have prov'd in my Remarks on Horace his Art of Poetry. 24\. The Poets who came after him, were naturally carried, to one, or other of these Sorts of Poetry, as they had more or less Inclination .] This passage is remarkable; Aristotle says, that the Poets who came after Homer , would not have had the ingenuity to invent the Idea of Tragedy, and Comedy, but satisfy'd themselves with the two first sorts of Poetry that is, some would have made Panegyricks and Hymns, and other Songs stuff't with Obscenity and Reviling, according as they had more or less impulse, and vigor. But when Homer , had discovered to them these two different Beauties; they were so charm'd, that they forgot all their former Inclinations, and apply'd themselves wholly to these two. This is a great Commendation of Homer , and 'tis not without reason, that Plato calls him, the Father of Tragedy. Sophocles knew this well enough, for he study'd Homer only, and by imitating him, became himself, so very difficult to imitate. 25\. Instead of Iambicks .] Instead of obscene and filthy Songs. 26\. Left their Heroicks .] That is Panegyricks, and Hymns. 27\. Those two sorts of work appearing more Noble .] Tragedy appear'd more noble, than Panegyricks and Hymns; and Comedy than silly Songs, and this is true. 28\. 'Tis not proper to examine in this place whether Tragedy has received the Form which is agreeable to it .] After Aristotle has explain'd the origine, of Tragedy and Comedy, he prevents the impatient desire we naturally have to know, whether Tragedy, which is a more perfect Poem than Comedy, has yet all that is proper for it, and be arriv'd to its last perfection; but as this is a question very difficult, and would take up a great deal of time to resolve, he reserves it for another Place: Truely, to do that, 'tis not sufficient to have spoken of its origine only; but of its Progress, and the relation all it's Parts have, one to another. 29\. Both to it self, and to the Theatre .] For Tragedy, must be examin'd, in these two different respects. In respect to it self, to know, whether that which properly Constitutes its Essence, be perfectly good, as the Fable, the Manners, the Diction and the Plot. In respect to the Theatre, to know, if no new Beauties can be added to the Decoration, and Musick, and what is of more importance, whether the Representation answers so exactly to the Action, that nothing is wanting to render the Imitation more perfect. This is in my Opinion, what Aristotle means; Victorius thinks, that to the Theatre , ought to be understood of the Spectators; but Aristotle could not mean that, for the Considerations of the Spectators, ought rather to be referr'd to the First than to this. 30\. Tragedy then and Comedy, being thus produc'd extempore, as I have said.] Aristotle makes here, a sort of Recapitulation, in explaining more particularly what he had said of Tragedy and Comedy, and relating the principal changes which have happen'd in them. 31\. And the other to Obscene Songs.] Aristotle calls these Songs Phallica ; a word which denotes that they were full of all Filthiness, and Impurity. 32\. Which are now at this time Sung in several Towns, being authoriz'd by Custom and the Laws .] The Complaint, which Aristotle makes, that these obscene Songs continu'd till his time, and were by Order of the Magistrates, Sung in several Places, is very like that, Horace made, a long time after; Concerning the Subjects, of the first Satyrs. Of Exodia , which retain'd much Obscenity, and Fescennine Verses, which lasted a long time after the Establishment of Comedy. Et grave Virus Munditiae poeulere. Sed in longum tamen aevum Manserunt, hodieq; manent vestigia ruris, Politeness did at last, Poems obscene Expel; tho' a long time they did remain, And still do marks of Clownishness retain. Epist. 1st. of the 11th Book. The People are always the same, and obstinately retain, the most licentious, and obscene things; especially, when they are unfortunately joyn'd to Religion. However 'tis the property of rudeness, to give place, to what is polite, with much difficulty. 33\. Every one adding somewhat to their Beauty, as they discover'd what was agreeable to their Character .] This is the Sense of these words, ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which have hitherto remain'd in obscurity. The Changes which Tragedy and Comedy underwent were by little and little; for 'twas impossible to discover what was proper for them all at once; and new Graces were added to them, as the Nature of these two Poems was understood. 34\. After-Tragedy had received a great many Changes .] 'Tis in the Greek, when it had all that was of its own Nature . But what shall we say? Since Aristotle assures us, that Tragedy made no stop, till it had received all which was proper for it; he determines that it was in its Perfection, and voids the Question which he would not resolve, but reserv'd to another time; however we should be deceived, if we reason'd in this manner. For Tragedy may have all that is proper for it, without being in its Perfection; because 'tis not impossible, that what is proper to it, may still have occasion to be further polish'd and perfected. 36\.  Æschylus was the first who brought two Actors on the Stage, for before him there was only one.] Aristotle does not explain here, the first Changes which were made in Tragedy; he takes it in the State Thespis left it; for before that Poet, 'twas only Song and Chorus. Thespis was the first who thought of introducing an Actor into the Chorus, who to let them rest and take Breath, should recite the Adventures of some famous Man; and this is what Horace means in his Art of Poetry. Ignotum Tragic ae genus invenisse Camoena Dicitur, & Plaustris vexisse Poemata Thespis, Qui Canerent, agerentque, peruncti f aecibus ora. Thespis an unknown Tragedy began, Whose stroling Crew on all the Country ran; And Sing, and Act, with Faces all bedawb'd With Lees of Wine. What Horace says of Thespis going with his Actors thro' the Villages, serves to explain a Passage of Diogenes Laertius , who speaking of Solon , says, ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/THgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/rbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/PSgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , Causabon was in the wrong to correct, ἄ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  to sing , for ἂ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  to lead. Diogenes says formally, That Solon forbad Thespis to make Tragedies, and to strole about the Country with them, because they were pernicious Lies . As for what remains, the same Diogenes explains the Changes which happened in Philosophy, by those which fell out in Tragedy; and because that Passage serves to explain this of Aristotle , I shall quote it entire. As in Tragedy there was anciently a Chorus only which Acted alone, so afterwards Thespis invented another Person to give some rest to the Chorus; and Æschylus added a second to that first, and Sophocles a third, and so they gave the compleat form to Tragedy. The same has also happen'd in Philosophy, at first there was only Natural Philosophy ; Socrates found out Morality, and Plato added the Dialectick, and by that means perfected Philosophy. Æschylus finding that the single Person which Thespis had introduc'd, between the Songs of the Chorus did not please, took in another, who should talk with the first on the Stage. This added a great Beauty to Tragedy, and by means of this way of Dialogue, he succeeded according to his expectation. Castelvetro could by no means comprehend what these different Actors of the Chorus were, nor the nature of the Narrations they made, and which at last gave occasion to the Subjects of Tragedies, as we shall see elsewhere. 37\. He shorten'd the Songs of the Chorus .] As the first Person Thespis introduc'd, was design'd only to give a time of rest to the Chorus, so what he recited, was properly nothing, but an Addition to the Tragedy. But after Æ schylus had added another to the first Person, and so establish'd Dialogue, that Accessory was become the Principal, and the Chorus in its turn, serv'd only to give respit to the Actors. This is the reason he shortn'd the Songs of the Chorus, for that is the meaning of ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif)  . They are in the wrong, who think, that by this, Aristotle would say, he diminished the Number of those that compos'd the Chorus. Æ schylus only retrench'd the length of the Songs of the Chorus, to give the more room to the Dialogue between his two Actors, and did not meddle with those who compos'd it, till after his Eumenides , or the Furies , where the great Number of Furies, who compos'd the Chorus, made such a terrible disorder in the Theatre, so frightn'd the Children, and the Great-belly'd Women, that the first died, and the latter miscarried on the Spot. The Magistrates to prevent any such Disorders, ordain'd, that for the future, the Chorus should consist of fifteen Persons at most, whereas before there were fifty. Aristotle then had no reason to attribute to Æ schylus , the alteration which was made by order of the Magistrate, and which he was uneasie at. If Æ schylus shortn'd the Songs of the Chorus, whence comes it to pass, That in Aristophanes's Frogs, Euripides blames him for making the Chorus, in some of his Pieces, consist of four Successive Copies of Verse; and that he does not give time to the Actors to Speak. There are two things by way of Answer to this Objection. The First is, That tho' Æ schylus knew how to abridge the Songs of the Chorus, yet he knew not how to reduce them to their Just Bounds, as Sophocles did after him: And the other, That there were some Pieces indeed where Æ schylus was particularly guilty of this Fault; nay, where he had affected, to lengthen the Songs of the Chorus, and to give them almost their former extent; As in his Niobe and Hector's Ransom , and this is what Aristophanes had in view. 37\. Invented the Idea of the Principal Character .] The Greek says, the Principal Part. Æschylus having added a second Person, 'twas necessary, in order to preserve the unity of Action in Tragedy, that one of these Persons should have the chief Character, and the other should be one of his Retinue, or dependant on him; for if these two Persons had been both Heroes, so equal, that the part of one had not been subordinate to the other, there had been no unity of Action. 'Tis for this reason, that Æ schylus formed the Principal Character.

I never Dream, by chance Applause to win, Nor with Confusion, do my Plays begin; An Actor first, Comes from behind the Scenes, T' explain to th' Audience what the Drama means. As for what remains, Aristotle speaks here only of the most Considerable changes, Æ schylus made in Tragedy, and passes silently over the less important, as that he had his Actors mask'd; that he gave them Gowns with long Tails, and Buskins; that instead of a Cart, he built an Indifferently raised Theatre; that he changed the Stile from Burlesque, to Grave and Serious. Horace does just the Contrary, speaks of these and omits the others. Post hunc personae pallaeq; repertor honestae Æschylus, & Modicis instravit Pulpita tignis, Et Docuit magnumq; loqui, nitiq; Cothurno. Æschylus Robes and Masks, found for this Art, Actors, in Theatres built in his time, First trode on luskins, and first Spoke sublime. Atheneus adds, that he found out many Dances for the Chorus; that he manag'd his own Habiliments without any help; and Philostratus assures us, that he first thought it indecent, to sprinkle the Scenes with blood: and for that reason, began to remove Murders from the Spectators Eyes. 39\. Sophocles added a third Actor to Æschylus's two .] Sophocles having more narrowly examin'd the Nature of Tragedy, found that Æ schylus's two Actors did not set off the Scene well, and could not give an opportunity for such a Variety of Plots and Contrivances, as ought to be there: For this reason he added a third, and all the Greek Tragedians remain'd here, and never thought of increasing the Number, being perswaded, that the perfection of it consisted in these three Speakers: at least 'tis certain that they very rarely admitted four; which made Horace lay down this Rule. Nec quarta loqui persona laboret. Ne'er strive to make a fourth Person speak. Sophocles undoubtedly took his third Person from Homer , who often brings three Actors together, and very seldom any more. I must confess also, that this Dialogue of three is more agreeable, because it is less confus'd. If we will consider Nature her self, we shall find that very few things concern more than three Persons at a time. In Plato's Dialogues, which are purely Dramatick, there are indeed more Persons, but it happens very seldom that more than three speak at a time. Nevertheless, we may admit four or five, Actors, in the same Scene, if the matter requires it, provided that we avoid Confusion; This gives Beauty and Majesty to a Scene, and serves also, to increase the Concern, which ought to be in the Spectators, as we may see in those Tragick Poets who have successfully written, and perhaps this is the only Advantage that ours, has over the Greek Tragedy: But there is a great deal of Art, and Spirit requir'd, to do it well; 'tis not the work of a Scholar. Aristotles Saying here, that Sophocles added one Person to Æ schylus's two, would make us think, that there were never more than two Actors in the latter's Plays. Yet, in one Scene of his Coephores; Orestes, Pylades , and Clytemnestra talk together: and in another Scene of his Eumenides , we see, Minerva, Orestes and Apollo . 'Tis true that one of these says but very little; but it suffices to show, that Æ schylus was not entirely ignorant, that a Scene would bear three Actors. How can Aristotle then attribute this Invention to Sophocles ? Was it because Sophocles did it more Commonly? I can't believe it. It was twelve Years after Æ schylus had seen some of Sophocles's Pieces, that he made, his Coephores , and Eumenides ; and from them he took his third Actor which Sophocles had added. 40\. Adorn'd the Scenes, with fine Decorations .] Æ schylus had adorn'd the Scenes very vvell before Sophocles ; for instead of Huts, and Dens, and Woods, with which they were adorn'd, he represented Cities, Palaces, Altars, Tombs and Machines, for which he employ'd a certain Engineer, call'd Agatharcus , as Vitruvius informs us, Namque primum Agatharcus, Athenis, Æschylo docente, Tragicam Scenam fecit, & deco Commentarium reliquit . He who has translated Vitruvius into French , and enrich'd him with fine Cuts, is very much deceived in this Passage, for he Translated it. ' Tis thus that Agatharcus being instructed by Eschylus at Athens, in the manner how he ought to make Decorations of the Theatre for Tragedy, and in having first wrote a Book ,  &c. Agatharcus was in no wise instructed by Æ schylus ; on the contrary, Æ schylus was instructed by Agatharcus, Æschylo docente , doth not signifie, Æschylus teaching him , as he thought; but it signifies,  Æschylus causing his Pieces to be acted , he at that time possessing the Theaters at Athens ; for doc[illeg.] fabulas , as in the Greek , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , to teach Tragedies and Comedies , signifies properly to have them acted. Vitruvius says, for Agatharcus was the first at Athens, who when Æschylus's Pieces were acted, adorn'd the Scenes with fine Decorations, and composed a Book of them . But to return to Aristotle's Passage; Altho' Æ schylus had considerably chang'd the Theatre, yet there is great likelihood that the same Decorations serv'd for all his Pieces, whereas Sophocles chang'd the Decorations , according to his Subjects, and 'tis this makes all the Ornament of the Scene, when it agrees exactly with what it represents. 41\. In short, 'twas late e're it received that Gravity and Grandeur which were convenient for it .] For before Æ schylus , Tragedy had in no measure its just Grandeur, 'twas proportion'd to the trivial Subjects it treated off, and retain'd very much of its Original Burlesque. Æ schylus corrected these two Faults, for he chose Noble Subjects, (to which he gave the extent they ought to have) and exalted the Stile. Et docuit magnumque loqui. 42\. Which it retain'd of those Satyrical Pieces from whence it came .] He will be very much deceived, who thinks that Aristotle speaks of Satyrical Tragedies, when he says, that it retaind a long time the Burlesque Stile of those Satyrical Pieces from whence it proceeded; for these Tragedies succeeded the true ones, and the Stile of those Pieces was by no means Burlesque, but half Serious, and half Jocose, 'twas an agreeable mixture of Tragedy and Comedy, as has been fully explain'd in my Remarks on Horace's Art of Poetry. Aristotle calls here these Satyrical Pieces, the first Tragedy, those gross ex tempore Pieces; in which a Company of Clowns, bedawb'd with Lees of Wine, and Dancing in Honour of Bacchus , made as it were Satyrs, with which they celebrated his Feast, and speak to one another injuriously and obscenely. 43\. The Trimiter Iambicks succeeded the Tetrameter which were always used, because they were Satyrical, and full of Motion and Dances .] As the first Tragedy was only a Chorus of Clowns who Sang and Danc't, it employ'd only the Tetrameter Verse, which is the most proper for Dancing and Motion, Nature it self having furnish'd them with the sort of Verse which was agreeable to that sort of Tragedy: For as Victorinus says, Est Carmen Jocosis motibus emollitum, gestibusque agen[illeg.]ium satis accomodatum ; that is, a Verse whose softness agrees to the Gayety of Motion, and is very conformable to the Gestures of Dancers. This Tetrameter Verse is truly compounded of Troch aees, i.e. one foot long and one short, and this is the most skipping and brisk of all Numbers; 'tis for this the Poets of the Latin Peices called Atellani , retain'd it in their Chorus's, which were composed of Satyrs. Aristotle confirms in the third Book of his Rhetorick what he says here. For, as anciently , says he, the Tragick Poets passed from Tetrameter Iambicks, to Trimeter, because of all Verse, it was the most like our common Discourse. 44\. But after the Diction that was proper for it, was established .] That is to say, after Tragedy and Comedy were distinguish'd, and Thespis had added a Person to the Chorus, it changed its Stile; it being unnatural that an Actor should relate the Actions of a Hero, in the same Language used by a Chorus of Countrymen, who Sang and Danc'd. Therefore 'tis, Aristotle adds that Nature it self discovered the Verse which agreed to the Stile of a common Relation or Discourse. 45\. For Iambicks are of all sorts of Verse the most proper for Conversation .] Tragedy had been very imperfect, if Nature had not dictated the Verse which was agreeable to it. Now that which was most agreeable to it, was that which was most like our common Discourse, and consequently it was Trimeter Iambick, for that was most used in familiar Talk and Conversation. And Tragedy being an imitation, it ought to admit nothing but what is natural and easie. If we follow close all the Consequences which naturally flow from this Principle, (whose truth we cannot question) we shall find the great Advantage the Greek and Latin Tragedy had over ours in this respect. Horace is not content to say with Aristotle , That Tragedy adopted Iambicick Verse, because it was most proper for Discourse: He adds, That 'twas also because it was better to still the noise the People made in the Theaters, and that is it made the Action go better on. Hunc socci Cepere pedem, grandesque Cothurni, Alternis aptum sermonibus, & Populares Vincentem strepitus, & natum rebus agendis. Tragick and Comick Poets both allow'd This Verse, fit for both turns; t'appease the Crowd And make the Action better to appear. 46\. And very rarely Hexameters, which almost never come from us, but when we pass the bounds of ordinary Discourse, and change the Harmony and Tone .] We very rarely make Hexameters in Conversation, because it being compos'd of Dactyls, and Spondee's, it is loftier, more sonorous and harmonious than others, and consequently enters less into Prose, which ought to be very full of Cadences, but such as are broken and negligent, and when any doth escape us, 'tis presently known: For as Aristotle says, 'tis more noble and full of Harmony. Our Tragedy is very unfortunate in this, that it has no other sort of Verse then what is us'd for Elegies and for Epopoeia, It signifies little to say, that the Verse in Tragedy is plainer, and not so pompous as that of Epopoeia. 'tis always a great Verse of twelve Syllables: Our English ones are ten sometimes twelve , and since we can use such a Verse neither in Writing, Prose or Conversation, without offending a delicate Ear, which is a sure sign, that if our Ears were not corrupted by a long Custom, we should find little of what is natural in Tragedy, whose Language ought as much as possible to imitate familiar Discourse. 47\. The Number of Episodes encreased also with Time .] For at first all that was recited in the Songs of the Chorus, was only simple Adventures: Afterwards they were varied by an Episode , and at last they found the Art to incorporate many together, and to make one of many different parts, which however were natural and proper to the Subject. The Definition of Comedy. What Ridicule is. Why Comedy was not cultivated so soon as Tragedy. The Magistrates order'd the Chorus's. Who were the Poets that first form'd the Subjects of Comedy. The Conformity and Difference betwixt Epopoeia and Tragedy. How long the Duration of those Poems ought to be. Those who judge well of Tragedy, can judge well of an Epick Poem, but those who judge well of an Epick Poem, are not always capable of judging well of Tragedy, and why ? 1\. Comedy is, as I have already said, an Imitation of the worst Men.  64 When I say worst , I don't mean, in all sort of Vices but only in Ridicule, for Ridicule is properly Defect, and Deformity without Pain, and which  65 never contributes to the Destruction of the Subject in which it is. For Example,  66 without  67 going any farther , we call a disagreeable Countenance, and wholly counterfeit, without any pain, a ridiculous Countenance. 2\. The Changes which Tragedy has met with are sensible, and the Authors of them known, but Comedy is not so, because it has not been so much improv'd since its beginning as Tragedy For 'twas very late e're the Magistrates allow'd Comick Chorus's.  68 Those who acted then were free and voluntary Actors, who acted by themselves without order from the Magistrate. Since which, Comedy has began to have some Form. We know the Poets who wrote it, but we are ignorant who first used Masks, made Prologues, augmented the Number of Actors, and added those other things, which we find in it at present. 3\. Epicharmus and Phormys , were the first who thought of forming the Subjects, and consequently, that Manner came from Sicily. Crates was the first Athenian who  69 follow'd it, in omitting those gross Railleries, which were so brief in it before. 4\. Epopoeia, has this in common with Tragedy, that 'tis a Discourse in Verse, and an imitation of the Actions of the greatest Persons, and 'tis different in this, that it employs only one and the same sort of Verse, which is a pure Narration, and has a larger extent; for Tragedy endeavours, as much as is possible, to confine it self to the Circuit of the Sun, to exceed it as little as may be. Whereas there is no time limited for Epopoeia. But we must also say, That Tragedy, in its beginning, had no more restriction.  70 5\. He that can judge well of a Tragedy, and know assuredly , whether it be good or bad, can also judge of  71 Epopoeia, for all the parts of Epopoeia are found in Tragedy, but all those of Tragedy, are not found in Epopoeia. 1\. Comedy is, as I have already said, an Imitation of the Worst Men; when I say Worst, I don't mean in all sorts of Vice, but only in Ridicule.] Aristotle in giving this Definition of Comedy, determines like a great Master, what must be the Subject of its Imitation, as it is only that which is ridiculous, for all other sorts of Wickedness and Vice, can take no place here, because they raise Indignation or Pity, Passions which by no means ought to reign in Comedy. But what shall we say, was Ridicule alone the Subject of Eupolis, Cre[illeg.]nus and Aristophanes's Pieces? Since Horace assures us That there was not in their Times, a Knave, Robber, Adulterer, Murderer, Wicked or Infamous Person of any kind whatsoever, whom they did not expose in their Pieces with a great deal of Liberty. Si quis erat dignus describi, quod malus aut Fur, Quod m aechus foret, aut siccarius, aut alioqui Famosus, multa cum libertate notabant. Those who in Wickedness were counted chief, Assassinate, Adulterer or Thief, Or Profligate, who lived in their Age, They freely did expose upon the Stage. Notwithstanding, Theft, Adultery and Murder all Vices which surpass Ridicule, and tend to the Destruction of him who is infected with them; and so Aristotle's Rule is not true. This Objection does not at all invalidate the Philosophers Rule. If Aristophanes had put into his Pieces, a Robber, Adulterer, Profligate or Murderer barefac'd; this had indeed been contrary to the aim of Comedy, which always proposes Ridicule for its Object; he was far from doing that: On the contrary, 'twas his chief care so to hide those Vices under the Ridicule, that they might only appear thro' it. To prove this, we need only consider the manner by which he ridicules Socrates , when he would render him suspected of Impiety. Mr. Corneille in his first Discourse of Dramatick Poem, says, That the Definition which Aristotle gives here of Comedy, is not satisfactory, and thinks that he had a better in some of his Books which are lost. But Aristotle could not give a better, and I dare assert, That Mr. Corneille , condemns this only, because he did not well understand it. First of all he translated it wrong, for Aristotle doth not say, Comedy is an Imitation of Low and Deceitful People . Comedy indeed is not an Imitation of the greatest Persons that belongs to Tragedy and Epopoeia, neither does it represent the meanest Persons, since it brings eminent Citizens and Magistrates on the Stage. Secondly, That great Man was much in the wrong, to think that Aristotle did not define what the Actions are which ought to be the Subject of Comedy, for he very plainly gives us to understand, that whatever is ridiculous may be the Subject of it. Mr. Corneille was far from having the same thoughts of Comedy that Aristotle had, he was perswaded that the Actions of Kings might be admitted, provided they were not above it; and only Interests of State, or Love Intrigues, without any considerable hazard. But nothing can be more opposite to the nature of Comedy, since it always proposes for its Object that which is ridiculous. The Majesty of Princes agrees by no means with this Poem, much less ought to be sought after by Comedy. The Expedient Mr. Corneille has thought of, to distinguish the Comedies, where these great Persons are seriously introduc'd from the ordinary ones, by adding an Epithet which shall denote their Quality, and call them Heroick Comedies , is not very good. If there could be any such thing in Nature as Heroick Comedies, there might also be Comick Epopoeia's, which is monstrous. When Plautus made his Amphitryon , where he introduces Gods and Kings, he jestingly call'd it a Tragicomedy ; but notwithstanding that, 'tis a true Comedy, where he turns the Subject of Tragedy into Ridicule, and this is the only way that Comedy can take its Subjects from the Actions of Kings and Heroes. Ridicule ought always to be the Subject of that Poem; and 'tis a certain Sign that Nature it self has made this Distinction, for those Pieces which are compos'd according to this Definition, always succeed best, when we never see any others in the Theatre but with a mighty uneasiness. 2\. For Ridicule is properly a defect, a deformity without pain, and which never contributes to the destruction of the Subject in which it is .] This Definition is remarkable. We cannot laugh, without Inhumanity at that which is accompanied with pain, or tends to the destruction of its Subject. This can't be then the Subject of Comedy, and therefore Aristotle banishes all that can cause Horror, Aversion, or Pity, as also what is too serious or severe from his Comick Theatre, and I believe not without good reason. Comedy won't bear what is Grave and Serious, unless we have the Secret to joyn it with Ridicule. This is so true, that after the Laws had obliged the old Comedy to forsake its first Malice, and to become an Imitation of the common way of living only, the new Comedy endeavour'd to find out this Ridicule, which is the foundation of it. Menander and Terence have it in their Pieces, but not that extravagant Ridicule, which reigned in the old Comedy, 'tis a graceful and slight touch which tickles ones fancy, if I may so say, and may properly be called the Cream of Raillery and Joke. Moliere is not always content with the latter, but often adds the other, which has contributed no small matter to his great success. 3\. We call a ridiculous Countenance .] As Thersites's which Homer describes, in the 11th Book of his Iliads , and is altogether Counterfeit, without any pain, and 'twas so much the more ridiculous, as the Faults which were attributed to him, made him the more Uneasy. 4\. But Comedy is not so, because it has not been so much improv'd, since its beginning, as Tragedy .] As it ordinarily happens, the first was neglected, because the latter appeared Noble, and more Perfect; I believe that in Rome , Tragedy and Comedy had a quite Contrary Fate, and that Tragedy was not cultivated, till after Comedy had made a considerable Progress, and perhaps 'tis no very difficult matter to prove it. 5\. For 'twas very late, e'er the Magistrates allowed Comick Chorus's.] Aristotle gives a very good reason, for what he hath advanc'd; for no Art can be well improved, when it is neither authoriz'd by the Laws, nor receiv'd by Custom. The Magistrate began to allow Comick Chorus's, but very late; that is, to buy the Pieces of the Poets, and to furnish all things Necessary, for a Company of Comedians; for there was an Archon who took Care of these Affairs at Athens , and defray'd all the Charge, as the Æ diles did at Rome . This is what is properly called, To give the Chorus . There is a remarkable passage of the Poet Cratinus , on this Affair, where he Complains of the Avarice of the Magistrate; who to save Money, chose to buy a Piece, of the dull Poet Cleomachus , and to give him the Chorus, rather than to Sophocles ; who would not let him have so cheap a Bargain. &rbOgvgr; ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ἒ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Sgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/isubgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) , ὃ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ἂ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ἂ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) When Sophocles in Greece the Chorus sought, The Magistrate Cleomachus's bought Not worthy at Adonis Feasts to Sing.

Greedy of Praise, if he a Chorus can Obtain, he thinks himself, an happy Man. 6\. Those who acted then, were free and voluntary Actors .] They were good honest Countrymen, who being Charm'd with the first Production of Comedy, acted for themselves, when Tragedy was Publickly receiv'd, and acted at the Expence of the Magistrate. 7\. But since Comedy, has began, to have some Form, we know the Poets who have wrote it .] Since Comedy has been produc'd out of that Chaos, in which it was before; and that it has begun to take the Air, and Form of a True Piece of the Theatre. We know the Poets who have taken pains in it, and those who have made the most Considerable changes, but we don't know who began to give it that first Form, and an intimation, to other Poets, to bring it to Perfection; neither do we know who they were, which first employ'd Masks, made Prologues, and augmented the Number of the Actors. For these were the Additions made to its first Production, after Tragedy had received all that belonged to it. 8\. But we are ignorant, who first used Masks, made Prologues, or augmented the Number of the Actors .] Since Comedy succeeded Tragedy, and began to be improv'd, not till after, that, had obtain'd its Perfection; There is no doubt, but those who made it their business, to Advance the first Productions of Comedy, borrow'd Masks, Prologues, and the Number of Actors, from Tragedy, which was already perfect; and consequently, we may well admire, that the Authors of these Changes, should not be known, since they happen'd in a time when things were taken notice of. Probably they began to give no heed to this Show, till it was entirely clear'd; and 'tis remarkable, that it was no long time a doing: and truly Comedy passed with a wonderful quickness, from Gross, to Polite, and from Confusion, to Harmony and Order; for from Epicharmus, Chionides and Magnes , who lived in Æ schylus's time, 'twas not Sixty Years to Aristophanes , whose Pieces were read with an extreme Delight and Pleasure. 9\. Made Prologues .] The Greek Tragedy and Comedy never had Prologues separate from the Play, as those of Terence and Plautus , where the Subject is explain'd before the beginning of the first Act. Aristotle calls, all that is before the first Song of the Chorus, Prologue ; and which is so united to the Subject, that it cannot be separated; as we see in the Tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides . There is a Probability then, that Comedy did at first Employ those sorts of Prologues , which were in time left off, because they appear'd too difficult and serious. We shall speak further of these Prologues on the 12th Chapter. But Aristotle could not take the word in that sense; for I don't well understand how, Comedy could be without that Prologue , since that Prologue is all, that is before the first Song of the Chorus, that is, our first Act, It would thus be a Body without an Head: At least, if we don't say, that the first Act, was (at the beginning) an Exposition, of the Subject of the whole Piece; we shall find in what follows, that 'twas very troublesom, to be bound up to this Regularity; and therefore the Comick Poets, dispens'd with this way of explaining their Pieces. But I rather believe; that what the Philosopher calls here Prologue , is an Explication of the Subject, which the Comick Poets always put into the first Scene, as Euripides did in his Tragedies: Or else, by Prologue he means, what he afterwards calls Parabaze , where the Poet addresses himself to the Audience; and which Aristophanes puts in the middle of his Pieces. 10\. Epicharmus and Phormys, were the first, who thought of forming the Subjects .] All the Difficulty of this Passage consists, in knowing, whether by forming the Subjects Aristotle means; to feign Adventures, to make the Subjects of Comedy ; or if he barely understood, that these Poets, first endeavour'd to give to their Pieces, a Just extent, and to manage them with the same Art and Method, as Tragedy was. The Interpreters, have declared for the first Opinion; but they are deceived, by not examining this Matter, to the bottom. Aristotle could not say, that Epicharmus and Phormys invented the Subjects of their Pieces; for they were both Poets of the old Comedy, where there was nothing feign'd; and these imaginary Adventures were not brought, on the Stage, till the time of Alexander the Great; that is, till the new Comedy. To form the Subjects , is then, said here, in opposition to the manner of managing these Comick Pieces formerly. There was nothing more uncouth, 'twas only a texture of gross Railleries, where there was no relation or coherence, and consequently could not make one and the same Subject. 11\. And consequently that manner came from Sicily.] This is to establish what he said in the Third Chapter; That the Megarians of Sicily attributed to themselves the Invention of Comedy. 12\. Crates was the first Athenian who follow'd it, in Omitting those gross Railleries, which, were so brief in it before .] This Passage is very remarkable, for there is no one, in all Antiquity, who has exactly set down the time, when Clownishness was left out of Comedy, at Athens. Crates flourish't, about the 82d Olympiad ; that is, about 450 Years before our Saviour, till that time Comedy was unpolish't, and consequently, very little different from what it was, in its beginning. Tweleve or Fifteen Years after Aristophanes began to appear; So this Show, which had lain neglected for so many Years, arriv'd at its Perfection almost all at once. When the Greeks undertook to polish any Art, their first Essays, were generally Master- strokes. This Athenian Crates (for there was another of Thebes ) Compos'd many Pieces; The Ancients quote his Animals; Neighbours; Witch , or Sorceress ; The Plays ; The Rhetoricians ; The Samians ; The Guests ; The Bold; The Chirons , or The Centaurs. 13\. In Omitting those gross Railleries, which were too brief in it before .] This Confirms the Explanation, I have given of the Expression, To Form the Subjects . For Crates was the first at Athens , who forsook, the gross Railleries, that is, the first Products of Comedy, to follow Epicharmus's Method; To Form the Subjects , Cannot signifie any thing else, than to dispose and rank them , and by uniting, and adjusting, all the different parts together, to make up one and the same whole; for as I have said already, the new Comedy only, invented its Subjects; those of the old, and mean Comedy, were true, and no ways feign'd. 'Tis false then, that feign'd Subjects, succeeded, the Grosness of the first Comedy. This is Demonstration. 14\. Those gross Railleries.] Aristotle says, to the Iambick Idea , that's to say, to the biting Invectives of the first Comedy, which used Iambick Verse, as being the most Satyrical. 15\. Epopoeia has this in Common with Tragedy .] After having spoke of Tragedy and Comedy, he goes on to explain what Epick Poem is, Epopoeia , and to distinguish what is Common, to it, and Tragedy, and what is Different. 16\. That 'tis a Discourse in Verse .] For tho' the Verse of Tragedy be different, from that of an Epick Poem ; yet 'tis true, that Tragedy , and Epopoeia , are always Compositions in Verse. 17\. And an Imitation of the Actions of the greatest Persons .] For this Passage must be thus translated, ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , and not, an Imitation of great illustrious actions . For it is not necessary, that the Action, which affords Matter for an Epick Poem , be Illustrious and Important in it self; on the Contrary it may be very ordinary, or Common; but it must be so, by the Quality of the Persons who Act. Thus Horace says plainly, Res gest ae, Regumq; Ducumq ; The Actions of Kings, and Commanders. This is so true, that the most notable Action of a Citizen, can never be made the Subject of an Epick Poem , when the most indifferent one of a King, or General of an Army, will be such, and always with Success. 18\. And 'tis different in this that it Employs only one, and the same sort of Verse.] Aristotle says, in that it Employs only Simple Verse , which may signifie, and that it makes use only of one sort of Verse : And that it makes its Imitation with Verse only . Whereas, Tragedy, Employs Dancing, and Musick, as well as Verse; but I am satisfy'd, to express the most Essential Difference, the rest being of little account, amongst us. 19\. Which is a pure Narration .] This Difference, is yet more Considerable than the first; for there is nothing but Action it self, which can livelily represent, the violent Passions which reign in Tragedy. When as Epopoeia , uses only a simple recitation, without Actors; it being a Poem, more soft, moderate, and made for Morality. The Poet always speaks in this, and never in the other. 20\. And has a larger extent .] This Difference proceeds from the same Cause, I just now explain'd. Passions rule in Tragedy, so that Poem, neither can, nor ought, to be otherwise than short; since nothing that is violent is of long Duration. But Manner, and Customs, which are not begun and finish'd at once, belong to an Epick Poem ; and by Consequence, its Action ought to have a larger extent, than that of Tragedy, and cannot well be contained in the space of one Day only. 21\. For Tragedy endeavours as much as is possible, to confine it self to the Circuit of the Sun, or to exceed it, as little as may be .] I thought my self oblig'd strictly to adhere to Aristotle's own Words in the Translation of this, and to Content my self to give the Explication of it. Most People believe that by the Circuit of the Sun , we should understand, the length of a Natural Day; and think, that the Action of a Tragedy, may be of Twenty four Hours, but this Opinion is not only Contradicted, by the Constant Practice of all the Greek Poets, which remain, and on which Aristotle has grounded his Rule; but it is also Contrary to Common Sense, which can never suffer, that a continued Action, all of which, ought Entirely to be exposed to our Sight, should continue so long, and amuse the Spectators a Day and a Night; This would ruin the Verisimilitude, which is one of the Principal Foundations of this Poem. Aristotle assuredly calls the Circuit of the Sun , that space of time, in which he runs thro' our Hemisphere , and very wisely teaches, that all the Action of a Tragedy, ought to be Contain'd in the space of one Day, or one Night, and not to have the liberty to employ them both. If it is an Action that begins at Sun-rising, it ought to be ended before Night; if it be an Action which begins at Night, it should be finish't, before Morning; but as there are a great many Actions to be found, which are not contained within these Bounds, which imploy one part of the Day, and one part of the Night, he adds, that then you may change the time, provided that Change be not Considerable; that is to say, that you may take, the same space of time in the Day, and in the Night together, which may be taken either in the Day, or in the Night alone. For Aristotle did by no means pretend, to give Poets liberty, to exceed the space, of the Circuit of the Sun, or to give (for example) Fourteen, or Fifteen Hours, to the Action of a Tragedy, that would be unaccountable; And he took care not to permit that, which was so contrary to Custom, and capable of diverting the Poets, from that Perfection they ought to seek, and which is only to be found in a Just and exact Regularity. For 'tis certain that the most perfect Pieces are those, which require no more time, for the Action, than for the representation, as those of Sophocles , which ought to be follow'd in that point, as perfect Models: The Actions of his finest Pieces are but of Four Hours. But you may say, if the Action of a Tragedy, can be contain'd in such narrow Bounds, why then does Aristotle allow Eight or Ten Hours? Because there are Actions which necessarily require a longer time, and Aristotle would set down in his Rule, how long the Duration, of these Actions might be, without prejudicing the Verisimilitude, and trying the Patience of the Auditors. The Poet ought to take his Measures so well, that he doth not give Ten Hours, to an Action, which ought to be finish't in Four; nor to crowd that into Four, which ought to endure Ten; but of the two, 'tis better to err on this side than t'other. 22\. When as, there is no time limited, to Epopoeia.] When Aristotle says, that the time for Epopoeia is indeterminate, we must not inferr from thence, that we are permitted, to give as many Years as we please, to the Action of an Epick Poem; he would only have us understand by this, that those Epick Actions may be some longer than others, according to the Nature of the particular Action. For Example, The Ilias is full of Violence, and Passion; the Odysses , of Wisdom, and Conduct; Homer had then been guilty of a very great Fault, if he had made these two Actions, of an Equal Duration. Therefore he gives to the first but Seven and Forty Days; of which Achilles's anger, takes up but half a quarter: But to the Odysses he allows, Eight Years and an half. Virgil knew very well this Prudence and Wisdom of the Greek Poet; for to the Action of his Æ neids , whose Character is Piety, and good Nature, he gives Seven Years; In Confining that Poem, to the narrow limits of the Iliads , he would have been no less blameable, than Homer , if he had given to his Iliads , the whole extent of his Odysses. 23\. But we must say, that Tragedy in its beginning had no more restriction .] During the Time that Tragedy was only Chorus, there were no Limits prescrib'd for its Duration, which was measured, only by the Joy, and Effects of the Wine; 'twas no otherwise when one Person was added to the Chorus. For as all the Narrations he made, between the Songs of the Chorus, were only Episodes, which had neither dependance on, nor relation one to another, the Duration of that Diversion depended only on the Fancy, and that alone might take up as much time, as all the Tragedies, which could be acted in one Day, did afterwards take up, when that Poem was brought to the Perfection in which we now see it. 24\. He that can Judge well of a Tragedy, and know assuredly, whether it be good, or bad, can also judged of an Epopoeia.] The Foundation of this Maxim of Aristotle's is true in all Arts, and is, That to Judge right of any Work, we ought perfectly to know, all the Parts of which it is Composed. According to the Principle then, any Man that can Judge well, of a Tragedy, can also Judge well of an Epick Poem ; for what is in this latter, is very nearly in the other, we find in Epopoeia , as in Tragedy, Fable, Manners, Direction, and Affections. But he who is Capable to Judge, of an Epick Poem , may not have enough knowledge, to Judge well of a Tragedy; because there are in this, some things which are not in that. For besides the Dance and the Musick, which in Aristotle's time were counted the perfecting Parts of Tragedy there is Unity of Time, and Place; The Vivacity of the Passions; the Chorus's, the Decoration, and the Action it self, Epopoeia being only a Narration. This Judgment of Aristotle's is then very true and solid. The Definition of Tragedy. Its effect to refine the Passions. Its Style. The six parts which compose it. Manners are the Characters of Men, and the Source of their Actions. Why Tragedy is an imitation of Actions, and not of Men nor their Manners. The End Men propose to themselves, is always an Action, and not a Quality. Tragedy can subsist without Manners. What is of most Importance and Difficulty in Tragedy. What Manners are, and the Discourses which have or have not Manners. The difference of the Ancient Orators, from those of Aristotle's Age. Of the Musick, and Decorations. and Comedy in the following part of this Discourse, and at present of Tragedy, and shall give immediately a Definition of it, which will suit to what has been already said. 2\. Tragedy is then, an Imitation of an Action that is Grave, Entire, and hath a Just Length; of which the Stile is agreeably relishing, but differently in all its parts; and which without the assistance of Narration, by means of Compassion and Terror perfectly refines in us, all sorts of Passions, and whatever else is like them. 3\. I call, a Stile Agreeably Relishing when it has Number, Verse, and Harmony and I add, but differently in all its Parts because Verse alone rules in some, and Number and Harmony in others. 4\. This Imitation being made by the Actors it necessarily follows, That the Decoration of Scenes, is in some sort a part of Tragedy, as well as the Melody and Discourse with which the Imitation is made. I call the Composition of the Verse Discourse , and the Musick whose force is sufficiently known, Melody. 5\. As this is an Imitation of some Action and those who Act, are necessarily such, by their Manners and Sentiments;  73 there being no other Character which can distinguish them. 'Tis a sure Consequence, that all Actions proceed from these two Sources; that is, Sentiments and Manners ,  74 and which are the Causes of Good or Evil to Mankind. 6\. The Imitation of an Action is proper Fable; for I call the Composition of things Fable. 7\. The Manners are that which distinguishes the Quality of those who Act; and the Sentiments are the Discourses, by which they  75 make known ev'ry Action, or discover their Thoughts. 8\. Tragedy must then of necessity have six parts:  76 The Fable, Manners, Diction, Sentiments, Decoration, and Musick. Of these six, there are two,  77 which regard  78 the means; one which regards the Manner; and three which regard the Subject, or the Matter of the Imitation. 9\.  79 Tho' there are almost no Poets, as I may say, who don't employ these six Parts, in their Tragick Pieces; it is certain also, that they are found in all sorts of Subjects. 10\. But the most important is the Fable , or the Composition of things: For Tragedy is an Imitation, not of Men, but of their Actions, Lives, Good or Ill Fortune; all which  80 consist in Action: And the End which Men always propose to themselves , is not a Quality but an Action. Now we  81 have such or such Qualities by our Manners, but we are Happy or Miserable, by our Actions. Tragedy then does not endeavour to imitate Manners, but adds them by reason of the Actions, so that Actions and Fable are the end of Tragedy, for in all things the End is that which is of most importance. 11\. Add to this truth, That Tragedy cannot be without Action, but it may be without Manners; and truly there are none in most Peices of the Modern Poets. We may say also, generally speaking, That we find almost the same Difference between our Poets, as between the Painters, Zeuxis and Polygnotus . The 82 latter perfectly express'd the Manners, of which you could not find the least Stroke in the Works of the former. 12\. Besides, if any one should undertake to make a Set of Discourses, in which the Manners were perfectly express'd, the Diction fine, and the Sentiments very noble, I can assure him , that he has not all that is proper for Tragedy. Whereas a Peice which shall be much inferiour to this in all its parts, yet if it have its Subject, well constituted and manag'd, shall  83 sooner, and with better success obtain its end. 13\. A fourth Reason, which is no less essential than the preceding, is , That the most efficacious means which Tragedy uses to affect and please , are the Peripeties and Recognizances, for both one and t'other are Parts of the  84 Subject. 14\. To conclude, a certain Sign of what I have established, is, That those who undertake to make Tragedy, will find it much easier to succeed in the Stile and Manners, than to form the Subject rightly, and this is what all the Ancient Poets have try'd. 15\. 'Tis then certain , that the Subject is the Principal, and as it were the Soul of Tragedy. The Manners follow next, and it is absolutely as in Painting. For, if the finest Colours were mix't on a Cloath confusedly and without order, it would not give so much pleasure, as  85 the simple Sketches of a Draught. In a word , Tragedy is the imitation of an Action, and consequently is chiefly an imitation of those who Act. 16\. After Manners , come  86 the Sentiments, that is to say, the Faculty of expressing those things which belong to the Subject, and are agreeable to it. Now all that has respect to Discourse, depends on Rhetorick, and  87 common use. The Ancient Orators spake simply, and according to the common way , but those of this time  88 borrow all their helps from Rhetorick. 17\. Manners are what discover the  89 Inclination of him who speaks, and  90 the Part he will take in those things, where it will not be easie to remember what he will follow, or avoid: 'Tis for this reason, that  91 all those Discourses which don't at first give us an insight, into what will become of him who speaks , are without Manners. 18\. The Sentiments are that which explains what is, or what is not;  92 in a word 'tis that which lets us know the thoughts of him who speaks. 19\. The fourth thing, and which only regards the Discourse , is the Diction, which is, (as I have already said) the Explication of things by words, and which is of equal force both in Prose and Verse. 20\. After the Diction comes  93 the Musick which is the most agreeable of all that Tragedy can employ. 21\. The Decoration is also  94 very diverting, but  95 that does not properly regard either the Art of the Poet, nor make a part of the Poesie. For Tragedy keeps all its force without Representation, or Actors. And moreover, all that regards the Decoration, is more the business of Workmen and Ingineers, than the Poet. 1\. Tragedy is then an Imitation of an Action that is Grave .] For we have already inform'd, that nothing but Grave and Serious Actions can be the Subject of Tragedy and Epopoeia , since they both propose to imitate what is most important. 'Tis this also which makes the most essential difference between Tragedy and Comedy. For this imitates only what is Witty and Pleasant, and leaves all that is Grave and Serious for Tragedy. 'Tis Nature it self, who has made this just Distinction, as we have said elsewhere. 2\. Entire .] That's to say, which hath a beginning, a middle, and an end: for if any one of these are wanting, the Action is maim'd, and the Poem defective. 3\. And hath a just length .] For there are entire Actions, which would be too long, or too short for Tragedy, which ought to have a determinate length, not to be extended as Epopoeia, nor straighten'd as a simple Fable, as we shall find in what follows. 4\. Of which the Stile is agreeably relishing .] The Latin Interpreters, who have translated, of which the Stile is agreeable and charming , have by no means comprehended Aristotle's Thought, who does not speak here of the Virtues and Vices of the Discourse, but considers it with all the attendance that Tragedy uses, to perfect its Imitation; for as we have seen already, it employs Number and Harmony, as well as Discourse, either joyntly or severally, and 'tis this Number and Harmony, which he calls Relishes with a great deal of reason. He explains himself very clearly in what follows. 5\. And which without the assistance of Narration, by the means of Compassion and Terror, perfectly refines in us all sorts of Passions, and whatever else is like them .] A perfect Definition ought to mark the end and aim of the thing defin'd, and this is what Aristotle does here: We'll endeavour to explain this last part, which without contradiction, is the most important, because it shews us the Advantage which may be made of this Poem, and which Plato had condemn'd as dangerous to Manners. 6\. And which without the assistance of Narration .] This is to distinguish Tragedy from Epopoeia , which employs only Narration, in order to obtain the same end, viz . to refine the Passions, and to induce good Habits, instead of those ill ones, it endeavours to root out. 'Tis on this account also, that it takes up a great deal more time than Tragedy, because the means it uses, are slower, and consequently less affecting, for what is represented to the Understanding only, does not make so deep Impressions, as that which is shewn to the Eyes of the Spectators, and which they learn by themselves. 7\. By the means of Terror and Compassion.] Epopoeia uses these means also, but as it employs others, and quite contrary ones too, and makes particular use of Admiration, Aristotle had reason to attribute Compassion and Terrour to Tragedy, for these two Passions are very proper to it, and proceed more from Action than Narration. We may say too, that we could have no Tragedy without Terrour and Compassion, when Epopoeia will pass very well, and yet have none of their help. 8\. Perfectly refines in us all sorts of Passions, and whatever else is like them .] This is, as has already been said, the most important place of the Definition, as also the most difficult; for what the Commentators have said to explain it, serves only to render it more obscure. There are several Explications of it, to be found among them, but the true one is not there. And this is what very much embarrass'd Mr. Corneille , who after a long search understood but one small part of it, and had only a glimpse of that neither. Since he doubts whether Tragedy, tho' it has all the Conditions Aristotle requires would refine the Passions. I am afraid , says he, that the Reasoning of this Philosopher, is only a fine Idea, and that it never was effectually true . He is not far from the Opinion of one of Aristotle's Interpreters, who thinks he speaks of this refining of the Passions only to contradict Plato , who had condemn'd Tragedy and banish'd it from his Common-wealth, because in imitating all sorts of Actions, as well bad as good, it insinuated it self into the Minds of the Spectators, by its agreeableness, and reviv'd those Passions which it ought to extinguish. Aristotle is then desirous to show, that 'tis to no purpose to banish it from well regulated States, and to succeed in that Design he finds the Advantage of it in these Agitations of the Soul, and endeavours to render this Poem commendable by the very same reason which Plato used to have it banish'd. If we had the second Book of this Art of Poetry, in which Aristotle explains himself at length, as he had promised in the last Chapter of his Politicks, we should not have been obliged at this time to defend him against these unjust Suppositions; but since that Book is lost, we must endeavour to supply the want of it as well as we can, and to show that there is nothing more true than what Aristotle says here of the refining of the Passions, which is the only end that Tragedy proposes to it self, and which is only found fault with, because it is not understood. There are two things to examine in these words: And which by the means of Compassion and Terror, perfectly refines in us all sorts of Passions, and whatever else is like them. First then, we must see how Tragedy can refine Terror and Compassion, in exciting them: and afterwards, how in refining Them, it refines also at the same time, those other Passions which would make us fall into the same Calamities; for in this the Difficulty doth consist; but before we proceed to that, 'tis Convenient to explain, the term, To Refine the Passions . The Academicks , and afterwards the Stoicks , made use of it, to say To drive out, To root them out of the Soul . In this sense 'tis false, to say that Tragedy can refine the Passions; for it is out of its power. But the Peripateticks being perswaded that 'twas only the Excess was Vitious, and that the Passions when regulated were useful, nay necessary, they meant only, by To Refine the Passions , to Curb the Excess, by which they err'd, and to reduce them to a Just Moderation. And this is the End, they attribute to Tragedy, as the only one it can attain to. Now let us see, how it excites in us Terror, and Compassion, in order to refine them; this is not very difficult. It excites them then, by setting before our Eyes, the Calamities, into which, those who are like our seves, have fallen by involuntary Faults; and it refines them, by rendring those very Misfortunes, familiar to us, because it teaches us by that, not to fear them, nor to be too much Concern'd when they do really happen to us. Aristotle is not the only Man who has had this Idea of Tragedy, the Emperour Marcus Aurelius , however Stoical he was, pass'd the same Judgment on this Art. Chap. 6th of the 9th Book of his Reflections; his words are very remarkable: Tragedies , says he, were first introduced, to put Men in mind, of those Accidents which happen in their Lives; to Inform them that they must necessarily Come, and teach them, that those things which they see with so much Delight on the Stage, should not appear insupportable in the Grand Theatre of the World; for you see plainly that such ought to be the Catastrophe of all Pieces, and those who Cry so much on the Theatre, Oh Cytheron; do not deliver themselves from their own Evils . This is then the first Effect of Tragedy, it refines Terror and Compassion, by themselves. The Advantage it brings to Mankind, by this, is sufficiently great, since it prepares them to bear the most unlucky accidents Couragiously; and disposes the most miserable, to think themselves happy, when they Compare their own Misfortunes, with those, which Tragedy has represented to them. In whatsoever Condition a Man may be, yet when he shall see, an Oedipus , a Philoctetes an Orestes , he can but think his own Afflictions light in Comparison with theirs. But Tragedy does not stop here. In refining Terror and Compassion, it refines at the same time, all those other Passions, which can precipitate us into the same Miseries. For in laying before us the Crimes, which have drawn those unhappy Ones, into the Pains they suffer, it teaches us to stand on our Guard, that we may not fall into them, and to Moderate, and refine that Passion, which was the only Cause of their loss. This is what Aristotle , thought and this is the Aim of Tragedy. To take away this, is to despoil it of its Character, and to make it lose the very Name of a Fable , since there is no Fable, which was not invented, to form the Manners, by Instructions disguised, under the Allegory of an Action. Our Tragedy may succeed well enough, in the first Part, that is, it may excite and refine Terror and Compassion. But it rarely arrives, at the last, which is nevertheless the most advantagious, it refines few of the other Passions, and as it runs generally on Love-Intrigues, if it refin'd any, it must be that only; So we must expect but very little benefit: we must not admire, if Mr. Corneille thought that this refining of the Passions, was Imaginary. But you may say, that if it was not, how comes it to pass, that Plato judg'd otherwise, and that he Condemn'd Tragedy, as the Engagement, and Boutefeu of the Passions? Plato consider'd Tragedy, only in its separate Parts, and Judg'd of its Effects, by those which It produc't on the Spot; for 'tis true, that in that very moment it rouzes and excites the Passions, as Aristotle [illeg.] agrees. Aristotle considered it throughly and Judged of it, by the Effects it produc'd after the representation was over, 'for 'tis certain that when the violent Motions, which the Actions have stir'd up, begin to abate, we naturally profit by those Crimes we have seen Committed, and which had drawn on the heads of their Authors such horrible Calamiities We may Compare Plato and Aristotle on this occasion to two Physicians; one of which Condemns a Remedy, that the other Approves. The first will argue with some show of Reason, 'that 'twill immediately put all the humours in Motion, and that in so doing, it will Cause in the Body an intestine War which is Capable of destroying it; and the other after having examin'd more narrowly the Causes and Consequences of this Disorder, shall maintain his Opinion by the great Advantage, which will accrue from this Evacuation; it being only of the noxious humours which were the Cause of the malady. This is exactly the Difference which is between Plato and Aristotle , Tragedy is a true Medicine, which Purges the Passions. Since it teaches the Ambitious, to Moderate his Ambition; the wicked to Fear God; The Passionate, to restrain his anger  &c. but 'tis a very agreeable Medicine, it works only by Pleasure. 9\. I call a Style agreeably relishing when it has Number, Verse and Harmony .] This is one of the Differences between Tragedy, and Epopoeia , This is only a Discourse in Verse; whereas the other Joyns to it Dancing and Musick. 10\. I add , but differently in all its Parts , because Verse alone, rules in some, and Number and Harmony in others .] Verse alone is used in the Acts; Dancing, Verse and Musick in one part of the Chorus; and Verse and Musick in the other. 11\. This Imitation being made by the Actors, it necessarily, follows, that the Decoratien of the Scenes is in some sort a part of Tragedy .] For truly there is no Action, which doth not suppose a Place where it was done, and Actors dress'd after one certain Fashion, rather than another, for this Decoration serves not only for Pomp and Show, but to express the Nature of the things which are represented. But as Tragedy will bear reading without being Acted, it follows that the Decoration is not one of its Essential Parts, which made Aristotle say, That it is in some sort a Part ; we manage the Decoration now adays, as if it was in no respect a Part of Tragedy, and our Theatre is (if I dare say it) no more than the Skeleton of the Greek and Latin ones. 12\. As well as the Melody and Discourse, with which the Imitation is made, I call the Composition of the Verse Discourse , and the Musick, whose force is sufficiently known Melody .] The first thing we ought to take notice of, in this Passage is, that Aristotle , puts Musick and Verse among the Parts of Tragedy, whenas they are not absolutely Necessary; for 'tis undoubtedly true, that Tragedy may subsist, without any Verse or Song, according to the Judgment of this great Man. 'Tis certain likewise, that Tragedy was not call'd a Poem from the Verse, but from the Fable, or the Composition of the Adventures and Incidents. If Tragedy can subsist without Verse, it can do it no less without Musick. I must confess, I could never well understand, how Musick came to be considered, as making in any respect, a Part of Tragedy; for if there be any thing in the World that appears stranger, and more Contrary than another, to Tragick Action, 'tis Musick. This will displease the Inventers of Tragedies in Musick, Poems as ridiculous, as new; and which would be unsufferable, if we had the least relish for the Pieces of the Theatre, and were not Enchanted and Seduc'd by one of the greatest Musicians that ever was; for the Opera is, (if I may speak it,) the Grotesque of Poetry and so much the more insupportable, as they pretend to make them pass, for Regular Pieces. We should have been very much oblig'd to Aristotle if he had told us, how Musick could be Judged necessary for Tragedy. Instead of that he is contented to say only, that, all its force is sufficiently known ; which denotes, that then all the World was convinc'd of its Necessity, and perceiv'd the wonderful Effects it produc'd, in those Poets whose Chorus's only were, fill'd up by it. I have often endeavoured to comprehend the Reason which oblig'd the Athenians who were such a nice and delicate People, to Associate Musick, and Dancing with Tragical Actions; and after many Searches to discover, how it could appear to them Natural or Probable, that a Chorus, which represented the Spectators of such an Action, could Dance and Sing after such lamentable and extraordinary Events; I have found, that, they folow'd their Natural Inclinations, and sought to satisfie their Superstition. The Greeks were of all Men in the World the most Superstitious, and most inclin'd to Dancing and Musick; Education confirm'd this Natural Inclination, and Dancing and Musick made a great Part of the Ceremonies of their Religion; after then the Chorus had pass'd from Hymns, to Tragedy, and from the Altar to the Theatre, the first Poets to satisfie their Religion, consecrated the Chorus's of their Tragedies, to Sing the Praises of their Gods, and especially of Bacchus ; For the Songs of the chorus, were for some time independent of the Tragick Action in which they were inserted, and had little, or no relation to it. The Defect of these Songs, so forreign from the purpose, was too apparent not to be soon perceiv'd; and then they endeavour'd to bring the Chorus by degrees, to say nothing, but what was agreeable, to the Subject of the Tragedy: And as almost all the Duty of the Chorus, consisted, in Offices of Charity and Piety, as I have remark'd on Horace his Art of Poetry; they retain'd the Movement and Song of the Ancient Chorus, because both one and t'other agreed perfectly, with the Discourse of those Persons who Compos'd the Chorus, because they satisfy'd the predominant Passion of those People, and because it agreed admirably well with their Capacities. Thus Musick and Dancing, were look'd on as a part of Tragedy. If it had been one of its Essential Parts, there could have been no Tragedy; but in the Theatre, it was such a Part as might be call'd becoming and ornamental; it was a Relish between the Acts, and not thro' the whole Play; for they would have look'd on that as Monstrous. 13\. As this is an Imitation of some Action .] For Tragedy does not propose to imitate Inclinations, and Habits, but Actions: and where there is no Action, there can be no Tragedy. 14\. And those who Act are necessarily such, by their Manners, and Sentiments .] It is worth while to observe, in what Method, and with what Address, Aristotle explains the Parts of Tragedy, in discovering the Nature of ev'ry one of them in particular, and dependance they have on one another. Tragedy is the Imitation of an Action, there is no Action, but proceeds from the Manners, and the Sentiments; therefore Manners and Sentiments are necessarily Essential Parts of Tragedy. 15\. There being no other Character which can distinguish them .] This decision is worthy of a great Philosopher; There is nothing but the Manners, and the Sentiments which can distinguish and Characterize an Action, the Manners, Form, and the Sentiments explain it, and lay open its Causes and Motives. 16\. And which are the Causes of Good or Evil to Mankind .] They are the Causes of Good or Ill to Mankind, because they produce Actions. For For altho' we may truly say, that the Manners and Sentiments are sufficient to make a Man happy or miserable, independantly from their Actions, yet the Tragick Poets know no other Good, or Evil, than that which proceeds from Actions; for otherwise, instead of imitating Actions, they would imitate Passions, or Qualities. 17\. For I call the Composition of things, Fable .] In my Opinion, by the Composition of things, is not here meant a mixture of Truth and Falsehood, as a very Ingenious Man thought; for that mixture is no less found in pure Fable, which consists rather of Words than of Actions. By the Composition of things, Aristotle means the Connexion, which the Causes and Incidents, that Concurr to form an Action, have with one another, to make one and the same Subject. In a word, all the different Parts of an Action, tho' it be neither Epick nor Tragick, ought to take notice of all that, which produces the Parts of which it is composed. Rightly to understand the sense of this Passage of Aristotle , we need only take notice of what follows this reasoning. The Imitation of an Action is properly Fable; For I call that Fable ,  &c. That For , shews the reason which oblig'd him to call the Composition of things by the name of Fable, and this reason is drawn from its Imitation of an Action. Those Fables which don't imitate Actions, mix Truth with Falshood, and Consequently this is not what Aristotle means here. 18\. The Manners are that, which distinguishes the Quality of those who Act .] Manners characterize Men, and denote their Inclinations, either good, or bad; The Manners of Achilles are to be cholerick, and hasty; Those of Æ neas to be sweet-temper'd, and devout. 19\. And the Sentiments, are Discourses, by which the make known, ev'ry Action, or discover their Thoughts .] The Sentiments, ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ,  , are not those internal Conceptions of the Mind, as the word ordinarily signifies; but the Discourses, by which those Conceptions are explained, whether they have only prepared an Action, or actually produc'd it. It is not sufficient to give Manners only to the Persons, they must also have Sentiments Conformable to those Manners, and must speak so agreeably to their Characters, that the Audience may know their Manners, before they see their Actions. 20\. Of these six, there are two, which regard the means .] These two are the Diction, and Musick; for these are the two Means, the Poet makes use of to make his Imitation, as has been said in the First Chapter. 21\. One which regards the Manner .] That is the Decoration, for the Poet exposes his Subject, on the Stage, where the Actors Play. 22\. And three which regard the Subjects .] These three are the Fable, the Manners, and the Sentiments. 23\. There are almost no Poets , as I may say , who don't employ these Six in their Tragick Pieces .] To shew that these Six Parts, of which he has spoken, are proper to Tragedy, he assures us, that there is almost no Poet who does not employ them in his Pieces; but as that Expression, There is almost no Poet , appear'd too general, he took care to soften it by this Modification, As I may say ; because he knew that there were bad Poets, who did not employ all six, and whose Pieces were defective either, for want of the Manners, or Decoration or the Action. 24\. ' Tis true also, that they are found in all sorts of Subjects .] This is a very remarkable Decision. There is no Subject of Tragedy in which six Parts are not naturally found, and truly there is none without Fable, Manners, Sentiment, Diction, and Decoration; There remains only the Musick and Song; but if we look more narrowly, we shall find, that this last, is no less there than the others for Musick is the Daughter of Passion, both Joy and Grief do equally produce it, and 'twas yet more familiar to the Greeks , than any other People, for those reasons I have already mentioned Thus Theophrastus has written, that there are three Principles of Musick, Joy, Grief, and Raptures of the Mind; for every one of these three, changes the Voice into a particular way of Singing; and This is the reason why Love, which Comprehends these three Passions, is so much delighted with Verse and Musick. 25\. But the most Considerable is the Fable, or the Composition of things.] Aristotle plainly determines here, that the most important, in this Poem is the Composition of the Incidents, which ought to form the Subject of Tragedy, and he gives such solid Reasons, that there is no room left to doubt of it. 26\. For Tragedy is an Imitation not of Men, but of their Actions ] This is the first Reason Aristotle gives, to prove, that Fable is the Soul of Tragedy ; for he says, Tragedy is an Imitation, not of Men, but of their Actions . If the aim of Tragedy, had been to imitate Men, it is certain that it would Manners and Quality much more than Actions; since there is a great number, who don't Act at all, or at most, their Actions are very inconsiderable, and consequently the Chief thing in Tragedy would be Manners. But it imitates Actions; from whence it necessarily follows, that Action constitutes Tragedy, and that there is no Tragedy where there is no Action. 27\. Lives, and their good or ill Fortune .] They who believed that Tragedy was an Imitation of the whole Life, of a Man, were not only deceiv'd, but have also made very bad Pieces: It imitates one Action only, but it chuses the most Considerable, which denotes whether a Man's Life be good or bad; wherefore Aristotle , after having said of their Lives , adds, And their good or ill Fortune ; He says good or ill, indifferently, because there was almost as many Tragedies, whose Catastrophe was happy, as there were fatal. 28\. Which consist in Action .] He says in what went before, that Manners are the Source of good or evil to Mankind; but 'tis to be understood that both of them are produc'd by their Actions: For the Theatre knows no Good or Evil, but what consisteth in that which Tragedy imitates. 29\. And the End, which Men always propose to themselves, is not a Quality, but an Action .] Men always propose an Action, for their end, and not a Quality. But you may say, don't Men propose, to themselves to be Learned, Pious, and Just? and are not Justice, Science and Piety, Qualities? this is true; but if we examine it further, all these Qualities, are not the End proposed, but the Means whereby they hope to attain their End, which can be nothing else than an Action. The General End that Mankind proposes, is to live Happily; now to live happily is always an Action, and cannot be a Quality. And truly, as the End of all Trades and Arts is an Action, and the End a Man proposes can be nothing but an Action; for he is properly an Artist, and not born to live Idly. This End is their happiness; now this happiness consists only, in doing those Actions, which are conformable, to the Rules and Precepts of Virtue. If the Felicity of Man did not consist in Action, and was only a Quality, or Habit, he would be happy even Sleeping, and would be the only Being which would have no Action, which was proper and peculiar to him, and consequently he could not propose any End, or that End would, neither be in his power, nor depend on his Labour, which is absurd; for the End and Happiness of any thing whatever, consists in the Perfection of that Action which is proper for it And this is what Aristotle has prov'd very well, in his Morals, and in his Politicks. 30\. Now we have such or such Qualities by our Manners .] For the Manners cause us to have, such, or such Inclinations; which make the Qualities, that Characterize the Man. 31\. We are happy, or miserable by our Actions .] If this Maxim of the Emperour Marcus Aurelius is true in Morality, That the Good and Evil, of rational Creatures, born for Society, Consisteth, not in the Perswasion, but Action, as their Virtues and Vices do : The reason is stronger in Tragedy, where, a Man may be happy by his Qualities, and unhappy by his Actions. 32\. But adds them, by reason of the Actions .] He adds, to render the Actions more probable; to give the Spectator beforehand, the pleasure to discover, how those Actions will happen, which shall proceed, from such particular Manners; and by that to render the Imitation more Advantagious. 33\. So that Actions and Fable, are the End of Tragedy .] He is not content to say, that Actions, are the end of Tragedy, that would be Equivocal; for Tragedy does not imitate Actions alone, and independantly; he adds, and Fable , and to let us know, that all those things, or Actions, which make the Subject of Tragedy, ought together with their Causes, and the suitableness and relation of all its different Parts, to form only one and the same Subject, this is what he properly calls Fable . I call Fable , says he, the Composition of things . Tragedy then proposes as its End, the imitation of an Action. It has also another, which is to Correct, and Instruct us, by refining the Passions; but this is mediately such, at which it cannot arrive, but by the former, and which then becomes a Means of doing it. 34\. For in all things, the End is that which is most important .] This is a truth, against which no Exception can be made. The Means are always less noble than the End, and Subordinate to it; This is a necessary Consequence which depends on that General and Universal Law, that the less perfect, things, are created to be subservient to those which are more perfect. 35\. Add to this truth, that Tragedy cannot be without Action, but it may be without Manners .] A sure and certain sign, that Action is the life of Tragedy, is, that it can subsist, without Manners, but not without Action; This can never be contested, for where there is no Action, there is no Tragedy, since Tragedy proposes to imitate Actions only. 36\. And truly there are none, in most Pieces, of the Modern Poets .] To Confirm, what he had said, That Tragedy may be without Manners; he cites for Example the Pieces of most part of the Poets of his time, which were nevertheless True Tragedies, altho' that had not Manners. But what is a Piece without Manners, say you? Mr. Corneille found much difficulty in this Passage, and after having examin'd it, he concludes, that Aristotle calls a Tragedy without Manners, a Piece when the Actors tell their bare Sentiments, or ground them only on Reasons drawn from Matter of Fact, without delivering any Maxims of Morality on Politicks. But he did not comprehend Aristotle , nor know, what he calls hereafter, Moral Discourses ; that is, Discourses, where the Manners are well expressd; for the Discourse of an Actor who speaks plainly, may very well express the Manners, without having any Moral or Political Maxims This is well known. See the 53d and 54th Remarks. A Tragedy then without Manners, is a Piece, where the Persons speak in such a way, that they don't make their Inclinations known, and so, that we cannot Judge by their discourse, what resolutions they will take in the Sequel; for they discover no farther than they Act. It is evident from this, that a Tragedy cannot be absolutely without Manners; but we say 'tis without Manners, when they are ill, and equivocal, that is to say, not truly distinguish'd. It were to be wish'd that Aristotle had named the Poets, of which he speaks, and given some Example of this deficiency of Manners. Among the Pieces, which remain of the three Greek Tragedians, there is not one without the Manners, altho' some of the Characters have them very obscure and Equivocal. 37\. We may say also, generally speaking, that we find almost the same Difference between our Poets, as between the Painters Zeuxis and Polygnotus.] Poesy, and Painting are so alike, that all the Vices, and Virtues which are in one, may also be found in the other. 38\. The latter Perfectly express'd the Manners .] All the Figures of Polygnotus's Drawing, were so lively, that the Spectator had not the least difficulty to know the very Genius and Manners of the Person they represented. The Passions were admirably well express'd. Thus Aristotle says in the Eighth Book of his Politicks; That the Works of this Painter ought rather to be shewn to young People, than those of Pauson , who, as Zeuxis , did not express, the Manners in his Paintings. Parrhasius, Polygnotus , and Aristides the Theban , were of all the Ancient Painters these, who endeavour'd, the most, to express them. The first painted the People of Athens , and succeeded so well in his Design, that he represented them Just as they were, you might see there at the same time all sorts of Passions, and distinguish the Inconstant, and Tenacious, the Cholerick and Mild, the Merciful and Cruel, the Proud and Humble, the Coward and the Brave,  &c. 39\. Of which you could not find the least stroke in the Works of the former .] All the Works of Zeuxis were without Manners, because he wrought on the Prodigeous and Wonderful; as we shall see, in the last Chapter save one. Pliny nevertheless, assures us, that he drew a Penelope , in which he seem'd to have painted the Manners, fecit & Penelopen, in qua pinxisse mores videtur . But this Remark of Pliny seems, rather to confirm, than destroy the reproach, which Aristotle casts on Zeuxis. 40\. Besides, if any one should undertake, to make a Sett of Discourses, in which the Manners were perfectly express'd, the Diction fine, and the Sentiments very Noble . This is a third Reason of no less force than the former, to shew that the Subject of Tragedy is more considerable than the Mannerrs, the Diction, or the Sentiments. For Example: Take a Tragedy in which these three Parts are admirably well managed, but whose Subject is not well treated; and another where the Subject is well conducted, and where the other Parts are much less so, this last shall much surpass the first, and succeed better, because it has the Property of Tragedy, viz . the care of the Action, and not so much the Discourse. 41\. I can assure him, that he has not all that is proper for Tragedy.] Victorius pretends that the Negative ought to be suppress'd, and that Aristotle had written, he had all which is proper for Tragedy , because in effect, says he, Tragedy very advantageously makes use of these three parts, to arrive at what it aims at. But he would do it much better if ,  &c. This Learned Man did not remember that Tragedy doth consist neither in the Manners, nor the Diction, nor the Sentiments, but in the Actions only, since it imitates them alone, and employs all the rest, as means only to perfect its Imitation. If there was no other difference between the Fable, Manners, Diction, and Sentiments, than being more or less necessary. Aristotle was in the wrong, to assure us, that Fable was the Soul of Tragedy, and this third reason would be very weak, if we might assert (as truly of the other three Parts separately, what he said of Fable. In a word, Aristotle could never say, that a Poet who neglected the Fable, could ever obtain what was proper for Tragedy, since his Work would be no Tragedy. Besides, 'tis a sure Maxim, That the Nature of every thing is that only in which its Perfection doth consist. The Nature of Tragedy is to imitate an Action. Action then is that alone which does properly belong to Tragedy, and this cannot be disputed. 42\. If it have its Subject well constituted and managed .] This is worth taking notice of, That a Subject well managed, tho' the Manners are ill exprest, the Elocution dull, and the Sentiments mean, shall succeed better than a Piece where the Subject shall not be rightly dispos'd, even tho' the Manners shall be perfect, the Diction well wrought up, and the Sentiments very fine. And this is true of Tragedy, because as I said before, the Perfection of every thing is in its Nature, and in its End. I am apt to think Comedy is quite contrary, the Manners, and Sentiments are more necessary there, than the Subject, and this no doubt proceeds from Comedy, being an Imitation of Manners, rather than Actions. You may see my Remarks on the three hundred and nineteenth Verse of Horace's Art of Poetry. 43\. Is that the most efficacious means which Tragedy uses to affect and please, are the Peripeties and Recognizances .] The most perfect Tragedies are those in which there are Peripeties ; that is, Revolutions, Changes of Fortune, and Remembrances, as in the Oedipus . Now the Peripeties and Remembrances are inseparable Parts of the Subject, since they consist intirely in Action; and consequently the Subject is the most Important part of Tragedy, as being that which furnishes the most sure and efficacious means to arrive at its end? 44\. Those who undertake to make a Tragedy, will find it much easier to succeed in the Stile and Manners, than to form the Subject rightly .] The fifth and last Reason which Aristotle gives to shew the Advantage the Subject has over all the other Parts of Tragedy, is drawn from the difficulty which is always found in disposing the Subject. This difficulty being compar'd with the facility of succeeding in the other Parts, is an Incontestable Proof that the Subject is the most important and proper part of Tragedy. For 'tis a Truth confirm'd by the Experience of all Ages, that in all Arts whatever, that which is the principal, is most difficult, and arrives latest to its Perfection. 45\. And this is what the Ancient Poets have try'd .] Altho' the first Poets affected a florid and lofty Stile, than which nothing is more opposite to the Manners, and which hides them so much as this elaborate way. Yet however they succeeded better in the Manners and the Stile, than in the Conduct of the Subject, in which they found such insuperable Difficulties, that hardly one has had good success. Æ schylus himself did not know all the Secrets of this Art, tho' he came nearer it than any of his Predecessors, and Sophocles was the only Man who perfected it This fifth Reason of Aristotle is then very solid, and Experience has long since convinced us, and what we do now confirms, that there is at this Day nothing which gives so much trouble to our Tragick Poets, as the Constitution of the Subject; we have few Pieces where there are not essential Defects as to the Conduct, and the Faults which are committed in any Art, after its Rules, are not only well explain'd, but what is more considerable, after they have been happily followed, and that we have Examples of it before our Eyes, do more plainly denote the difficulty, than all those which could be committed before that Art was known. 46\. The Manners follow next .] After the Fable, the Manners without contradiction, are the next. For as Tragedy is the Imitation of an Action, and there are no Actions without Manners, since Manners are always the Cause of Actions, it is evident that after the Subject, the Manners are the most important in Tragedy. 47\. For if the finest Colours were mixt on a Cloath, confusedly, and without order, it would not give so much Pleasure as the simple Sketches of a Draught.] Aristotle by a very natural and just Comparison, shews the truth of the two things he has established, viz . That Subject has the first place in Tragedy, and the Manners the second. The Subject is in that Poem, what the Sketches are in Painting, and the Colours are the same in this, as the Manners are in t'other. As a Painter who would draw a Picture, doth not mix his Colours on the Cloath confusedly, but traces first the Strokes of the Figure he would represent, and then uses with Order and Art those Colours which are proper to make his Picture remarkable and like. 'Tis just so with the Poet, he doth not huddle his Manners confusedly in his Piece, but begins by disposing the Subject and all the Parts of the Action; and afterwards adds those Manners which are proper to render the Action credible and probable. If the Poet and the Painter should manage their Business otherwise, 'tis possible one might divert the Sight, by the Vivacity of the Colours, and the other might amuse the Minds by the Beauty of the Relations, where the Manners might be very well taken notice, but neither one nor the other would give that Pleasure which Tragedy and Painting ought to give; and consequently, they must be out of the Rules of their Art. 48\. In a word, Tragedy is the Imitation of an Action; and consequently, is chiefly an Imitation of those who Act.] Aristotle does not finish the Proof, but the reasoning intire, is thus. Since Tragedy is the Imitation of an Action, it must needs Imitate those who Act. Those who Act cannot Act without Manners, for they are the Character and Principle of the Actions. The Manners then immediately follow the Subject of Tragedy; the consequence of which, is easily drawn. 49\. After the Manners, come the Sentiments that is to say, the Faculty of expressing those things which belong to the Subject.] Aristotle follows the Natural Order, the Sentiments are for the Manners, as the Manners are for the Subject; for as a Tragick Poet cannot imitate an Action well but by employing Manners; so he cannot well denote the Manners, but by the means of Sentiments, and by consequence the Sentiments must hold the third place in Tragedy. 50\. These things which belong to the Subject, [illeg.] are agreeable to it .] In the Sentiments Truth, or at least Verisimilitude must be followed. We folow the Truth, when we speak those things which are necessary to the Subject; and Veri-similitude when we say those things which are agreeable to it. A Poet who makes a Madman speak, must make him speak either exactly as a Madman doth or as 'tis probable he would do. 51\. Now all that has respect to Discourse, depends on Rhetorick or the common use .] The Greek has it, All that is of Discourse, is the Work of Polity and Rhetorick. Aristotle calls common usage Polity, the ordinary Language of the People, who speak plainly without Art. whereas Rhetorick teaches to speak with Art and Method, and to adorn its Thoughts with all the Graces of an Embelisht Discourse. After the Philosopher has said, That the Sentiments consist in expressing those things which belong to the Subject, or those which are agreeable to it, he teaches two ways, by which you may find all that is necessary to be said in both respects. Policy is for those things which are naturally found in the Subject treated of; for to find that, we need only follow the general Considerations, and common use: And Rhetorick is for these things which are agreable to the Subject, and embelish it, to discover these, 'tis necessary to have recourse to Art and Study, and to think a long time of their agreeableness, that we be not mistaken. 52\. The Ancient Orators spake simply, and according to the common way .] The Greek says, spake politickly. Aristotle would have us understand by this, That the Ancient Orators were content to speak according to the truth; that is, they did not endeavour to express any thing but what was to the purpose; and therefore they spake according to common Custom, as we speak in ordinary Conversation and Affairs of Life. But those who followed, were more corrupted, and seeking either to disguise or destroy the Truth, took very little notice of what belong'd to the Subject, they endeavour'd to find out the Veri-similitude, and only to express those things which were useful for them, and tending to the obtaining their Ends. And this is the reason why they borrowed assistance from Rhetorick. Victorius was deceived when he thought that Aristotle spake here of Poets, and not of Orators. The Ancient Poets acted quite contrary to what we have said, they endeavoured as much as possible to adorn their Discourses, and did not all follow the natural and plain way, as I shall prove elsewhere. 53\. Manners are what discover the Inclination of him who speaks, and the Part he will take .] The Definition of Manners, is wonderful. Aristotle uses only the word ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which signifies a Resolution made, with Inclination and Choice, and which proceeds from a Will which is determin'd; a Choice made with Advice, and after mature Deliberation. 'Tis for this reason, I say, The Inclination of him who speaks, and the Part he will take. In which I have followed the Definition, Aristotle gives of this word in his Morals, ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  [illeg.]. ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  What I call Resolution, Election is a desire which follows a Deliberation . Manners cannot be without this Choice, for Choice follows the Manners, ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif)  Aristotle explains the same in the third Book of his Rhetorick, that there are Manners in the Discourse of him who speaketh, when what he says, can give us occasion to judge what part he will take in all his Actions. This is the Oratio Morata , [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/sbrgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  of Aristotle. 54\. In those things, where it will not be easie to remember what he will follow, or avoid .] These words ought to be examin'd with care, for they discover to us a Secret, which many Poets are ignorant of, and against which many do every Day offend. That the Manners of a Person may be good, and well adapted, 'tis necessary that the Poet so order it, that when we see him in any important and difficult Emergency, we may be able to foresee what side he will choose, to know how he will behave himself, and for what he will determine. 'Tis thus that Homer, Virgil , and Sophocles have given Manners to their Persons. When Agamemnon sent Ambassadors to Achilles , we can judge what will be the Success of the Embassy, by what the Poet has told us of his Hero, when Æ neas in the Fourth Book of the Æ neids , received a Message from the Gods to Abandon Dido , and to forsake the sweetness of a young and tender Passion. What Virgil had told us of the Piety of that Prince, makes us determine the Resolution he will take, and before Mercury has finished his Message, we perceive the Impatience he had to be gone, and the Poet only confirms that Opinion, when he says, Ardet ab[illeg.]r[illeg.]fug a, dulcesque relinquere terras, Attonitus tanto monitu, imperioque Deorum. Longs to be gone, and leave that happy Land, Mov'd by the Message, and the God's Command. It is the same with Sophocles , all which that Poet says of the Character of Oedipus , prepares us for his extravagant Passions, and teaches us to judge what excess his blind Obstinacy will make him commit. 55\. 'Tis for this Reason, that these Discourses that don't at first give us some insight into what will become of him who speaks, are without Manners .] This is very intelligible, and I wonder any one could mistake it: In most part of the Pieces of our Poets now adays, we can't know the Manners of the Persons, but as we see them Act, we perceive that they are Unjust, or Cruel only, when we see them commit some Injustice, or Cruelty. What they say is not absolutely without Manners, for no Action can be without them; but we don't find those Manners which Tragedy requires, even such as consist in letting us know what those Persons will do before we see what they have determin'd. If virgil had let us see none of Æ neas's Resolutions, and we had been uncertain whether he would have obey'd the Gods, or prefer'd Dido ? In that case, there had been no Manners, whatever Diligence Æ eas might have used to hasten his Departure. 56\. The Sentiments are that which explains what is, and what is not .] The Greek word, ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  as the Latin word Sententia , or the French and our English word Sentence, signifies ordinarily, a Discourse of few words, which contains a Moral Instruction. It has also a larger Signification, for it signifies all sorts of Thoughts and Sentiments, whether they be exprest, or not. Aristotle puts it here for Sentiments which are spoken. 57\. The fourth thing, and which only regards the Discourse, is the Diction.] Aristotle assigns the fourth place to the Diction, Elocution. And we may truly say, That of all the essential Parts of Tragedy, Diction is of the least importance, tho' it extreamly enhances the Beauty of a Piece, when it is Noble, and proportion'd to the Subject. The Fable, the Manners, and the Sentiments, are without doubt the more considerable. And so says Aristotle, That it regards only the Discourse to let us understand, That a Tragedy may be perfect without the assistance of Elocution; for the Subject may be well managed, the Manners may be well denoted, the Sentiments may be fine, altho' ill exprest. An ill Elocution renders the Discourse flat, but that doth not destroy the Beauty of the other Parts. And this is what Aristotle means when he says, And which regards only the Discourse , or the Stile. 58\. Which is of equal force, both in Prose and Verse .] It has the same force in Prose, as in Verse, because it explains the Sentiments, and the Thoughts in both one and t'other. And for this reason Tragedy may indifferently make use of it here: But Verse is only used, because that Diction is more harmonious, and consequently more agreeable. 59\. After the Diction, comes the Musick, which is the most agreeable of all, that Tragedy can employ.] Aristotle having sufficiently explain'd the four essential Parts of Tragedy, comes now to the last; which may be called the Parts of Decency and Ornament, and these are the Decoration, and the Musick. He gives the fifth place to Musick, and to show the difference which he puts between this and those of which he has already spoke, he explains its Nature, by calling it plainly Agreeable . The word which he uses ἥ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif)  , signifies properly a seasoning, which is added to a thing to make it more agreeable. Thus Tragedy doth subsist without Musick, but of all the Agreements this Poem can employ, Musick is the greatest, for it is preferable not only to the Dancing and the Decoration, but also to the Number and Harmony of the Verse. This was Aristotle's Thought, and by it we see that the People who were most inclined of any in the World to Singing, did yet however use Musick as an Agreement, tho' not as the principal part of their Shows, and their nice Taste in this can never be sufficiently praised. As for the rest, the Musick of their Tragedies was the same which they used in their sacred Songs, for the Expiation and Purification of Men, because it was the most proper to refine the Passions. But that which appears to me yet more remarkable is, That the Poets had the care of ord'ring the Musick, for as they had two sorts of People in the Theaters, Persons of Quality, and the Commonalty, they judged it expedient to have two sorts of Musick in their Chorus's; one soft and sweet for those of the best Rank and Knowledge, the other loud and brisk for those of duller Apprehensions. This way all of them were in a manner equally pleas'd with the Musick, and Tragedy had very near the same effect on all sorts of Spectators, for whose advantage they were shown. 60\. The Decoration is also very diverting .] The Greek word which I have translated Decoration, is a general term, which properly signifies Sight, and Comprehends all, that makes the Beauty of the Shows as the Scene, the Ornaments, the Machines, the Habits of the Actors,  &c. The Decoration was a Piece of Magnificence, never to be equal'd, and always proportion'd, to the Subject; neverthelese Aristotle makes it the last part of Tragedy, he puts it after the Musick, and is satisfy'd to say, that it is agreeable and diverting. Tragedy can indeed subsist, and perform its Effect, by reading, without the Decoration. For that is only a simple Ornament, and which contributes among the rest to the Beauty of the Show; but which renders the Piece, neither better nor worse in it self. We ought not however, to desist from improving it; for besides the Service it does in the representation, it excites the Poets, and elevates their Spirits. The Decorations of the Theatres at Athens were so Noble and Magnificent, that the Ancients have wrote, that if the Charge for every Piece was computed, we should find, that they expended more Money for the Bacchantes , the Phenicians and the Medea of Euripides ; for the Oedipus, Antigone, , and Electra of Sophocles , than for all the Wars which they maintain'd against the Barbarians. 61\. For that does not properly regard, either the Art of the Poet, nor make a Part of the Poesy. Tho' there had been Poets which invented, new Ornaments, for the Decorations; yet those new Inventions had been by no means the fruit of Poesy, they are the Productions of a quite different Art. 'Tis the Art of an Ingineer, and not that of a Poet, which is then made use of. But this Passage, occasions a Remark which I think [illeg.] very important; Since Aristotle assures us, how that the Decoration is the only Part, which does not regard the Poets Art, and that in no respect it depends on Poesy, 'tis a sure sign that the other five do necessarily depend on it. No body doubts of the four first, the Fable, the Manners, the Sentiments, and the Diction. For altho' properly speaking, there is only the Fable which regards the Poets Art, the Manners depending on Morality, the Sentiments on Rhetorick, and the Diction on Grammar; nevertheless, as a Poet ought to be no less instructed in all those Arts, than in that of Poesy, and that that of Poesy necessarily presupposes the rest, it may be truly said that those four things regard the Poet only. But does Musick make a Part of this Art? This is what we can scarce Imagine now, when we see Poesy and Musick two such different Arts, that we rarely find them joined. Those who have succeded in Poetry have known nothing of Musick, and the greatest Musicians have had no knowledge of Poetry. There were many Musicians who were not Poets; but there was no Poet, who was not a Musician, because he Composed the Musick for his Pieces: Musici qui erant quondam, Iidem Poet ae , says Cicero ; for in Greece Musick was the Foundation of all Sciences; they began the Education of their Children by it, and were perswaded that they ought not to expect any thing Considerable from that Man, who was not Skill'd in Musick. This Sentiment was but too well grounded; and I don't doubt, but it was one of those things, which gave, such an Advantage to the Greek Poesy, over ours , and the Latin ; for at Rome , as now in France and England , Poesy and Musick were two Arts, entirely seperated; and the Poets gave their Pieces to the Musicians to Compose the Musick, not only for Comedies, as we see by those Pieces of Terence but also for Tragedies, as appears by divers places of Cicero. 62\. And moreover, all, that regards the Decoration is more the Business of Engineers and Workmen, than the Poet .] Tis true that the Decoration properly belongs to the Workmen and Engineers, but the Poet ought notwithstanding, to be Capable of Judging, whether it be well or ill done; and of what is proper, or improper for his Pieces. Of the Constitution of the Subject. An Exact Definition of the Three Parts, of a Perfect, and Entire Whole. In what the Beauty of all Beings that have Parts doth Consist. What the Extent of Dramatick Pieces ought to be, and the length of their Representation. 1\. These things being explain'd, let us see how the Constitution of the Subject ought to be, since it is the First and Principal Part of Tragedy. 2\. We have said that Tragedy is the Imitation of an Action that is perfect and entire, and of a Just extent, for there is a thing which is entire, and yet hath not a  96 Just extent; I call that Entire, which hath a Beginning, a Middle, and an End. 3\. The Beginning is that, which necessarily supposes nothing to be before it, and requires after it, something else, which is, or ought to be. The End, is Just Contrary, for it requires nothing after it, but necessarily supposes something which precedes it.  97 The Middle is that, which  98 supposes something, which ought to precede it, and requires something which ought to follow. 4\. Those then who would manage a Subject well, can neither begin, nor, end, it, where they please, but ought to follow the Scheme which I have given. 5\. Add to this, that whatever is fine aamong Animals, or other beings, if it is Compos'd of Parts, ought not only to be in order, but it ought also to have a Just and reasonable Magnitude; for Beauty consists in the Order, and in the Magnitude. 'Tis for this reason that nothing which is too little, can be fine, because the Sight is confounded in an Object, which we see as it were in an insensible moment; what is too great cannot be fine neither, because we don't see it all at once; and in viewing the Parts successively, one after the other, we loose the Idea of the intire thing; as if we say a Creature that was a Thousand Furlongs. Thus as Animals, and all other  99 Beings, ought to have such a Magnitude, that the Eye can take it in, and Measure it easily , all at once; so ought the Subjects of Dramatick Pieces, to have such an extent, that  100 the Memory may receive and retain them without trouble. 6\. Now the precise Measure of this Extent, in what regards the Duration of the Representation, and the Attention of the Spectator, cannot be determin'd by certain and fixt Rules. For Example, If an hundred Tragedies were to be play'd in one Day, we must measure the time by the Hour-glass, as they say it was formerly practised. It must be regulated then, by the Nature of the Poem it self, and assuredly the larger Extent any Piece has, the finer it will be, provided it be not so large, that the Subject, cannot be Comprehended all at once; and so the Prospect of it, be amazed and Confounded ; We may then determine in General, that this Measure depends on the truth, or the Veri-similitude,  101 That is to say, that a Piece to have its Just Extent, ought to take up so much time as it must necessarily, or probably do, rightly to induce all the Incidents, till the unravelling the Plot, shows the last Good, or ill Fortune of the Principal Persons. This is the Exact, and Just Measure of its Extent. 1\. For there is a thing, which is entire, and yet hath not a Just extent.] Aristotle declares here, why the Action which makes the Subject of a Tragedy, ought to be not only entire, and perfect, but of a Just Extent; for, says he, there are Actions, which are entire and perfect, and which nevertheless, have not a Just Magnitude, as are all those Actions which we may call Momentaneous ; because they happen in an instant, and have neither Preparation, nor Sequel. These Actions however Entire they may be, yet not having a due Extension, they can never make the Subject either of a Dramatick, nor an Epick Poem; They can enter only as Episodes, or Incidents. 2\. I call that Entire, which hath a Beginning, a Middle, and an End .] This is the same Definition which Plato had given us before in his Parmenides of, an Whole , or Entire thing . 'Tis necessary then, for an Action to be of a Just Extent; that it has, a Beginning, a Middle, and an End: That which has not these three Conditions, cannot be Entire, it will be imperfect; and consequently, cannot be the Subject either, of Tragedy or Epopoeia . For both one and t'other, necessarily require Actions, which have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End. In which they differ from ordinary Fables, that are very often, with a Beginning and Middle; but without an End, as are most of those of Æ sop . But as these Terms, Beginning, Middle , and End , are Indeterminate, we must explain them the more exactly. And this the Author of that excellent Piece of Epick Poem, has done before me, in shewing, that the Cause and Design of Undertaking an Action, are the Beginning ; that the Effects of those Causes, and the Difficulties we find in the execution of that Design, are the Middle ; that the unravelling and resolving those Difficulties, are the End ; and that thus an Action has its due Extent. He hath also render'd this very plain, by Examples which are well enough known: the Subject of the Ilias , is the Anger of Achilles , which was Destructive to the Greeks . The Beginning of that Action is the Quarrel of Agamemnon with that Prince: The Middle is all the Evils it was the occasion of; And the End, is when Achilles , satisfy'd with the Revenge he had taken, relented, at the Tears and Misery of Priam . The Action of the Odysses is not less Perfect; 'tis the return of Ulysses into Ithaca . The Beginning of that Action, is his Departure from Troy . The Middle are the Hardships which he suffered, and the Difficulties, which opposed his Design; The End, is his Restoration, to the peaceable Possession of his Kingdom. Virgil was as Prudent and regular in the Constitution of his Æ neids , as Homer was. The Subject is Æ neas ; who went to Carry his Goods, and Establish his Religion in Italy ; The Beginning of that Action is the Burning of Troy , and Æ neas's Embarkation; His Voyages, Fights, and what other Obstacles he met with, make the Middle; and it Ends with the Death of Turnus , which made him Master of Lavinia , and peaceable Possessor, of an Empire in which he set up his Gods. The Action of a Tragedy, ought to be entirely like, that, of an Epick Poem, and the Three Greek Tragick Poets which remain, have happily imitated Homer in that Point. 3\. The Beginning is that, which necessarily suppose nothing before it.] Aristotle is not Content to say, that an Epick and Dramatick Poem, ought to have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End; but gives also, an exact definition of the Three Parts; in shewing, that every one of them is Imperfect, and necessarily supposes something else: He says then, that The Beginning is that, which necessarily supposes, nothing to be before it . The beginning of an Epick , or Dramatick Poem, may be the Sequel of another Action; for Example, the Quarrel of Agamemnon , and Achilles , which is the beginning of the Action, of the Iliad , is only what follows, from an Incident, in the War of Troy . But to make that Beginning, to be Just, and Sufficient, as Aristotle here says, that it supposes nothing necessary before it, that nothing ought necessarily to precede it, and that it has something which follows; and this is the Beginning of the Action of the Iliad , all was quiet in the Grecian Camp, when Agamemnon , by his Injustice, gave Achilles an Occasion of being Angry with him; so we may Consider, this Quarrel, as an Affair, that was beginning, and which did not necessarily, depend on any thing, which preceded, altho' it did not come to pass without them: and we demand nothing more. There are Poets, as Statius , who little minding this Precept of Aristotle , give a Beginning, to the beginning of their Actions, and which go backwards, to the Original of things. Nothing can be more Vitious. Homer took Care, not to fall into this fault. Thus Horace gives him this Praise in his Art of Poetry, Nec reditum Diomedis, ab Interitu Meleagri, Nec Gemino bellum Trojanum Orditur ab ovo. Not Meleagers death, doth Diomede bring in, Nor from double Egg, the Trojan War begin. 4\. And requires something else, which is, or ought to be .] This last part of the Definition of Beginning, is so essential, that I would not forget the least word; the Literal Translation of Aristotle is, and after which something ought to be, or it self to do . I confess that these Terms appear'd to me very obscure. But as this Philosopher doth not employ one word which is not of absolute necessity, I used them at first without understanding them, but at last I believe I penetrated the Sense of them. Aristotle explains the Nature of the Effects which an Action produces, which are of two sorts, either present or remote. For Example: The present Effects which Achilles his Anger produc'd, were his retreat to his Ships, his Resolution not to fight, and the Defeat which the Greeks receiv'd from the Trojans . The remote Effects, and which were afterwards produc'd, were the Death of Patroclus , which gave occasion to his Reconciliation to Agamemnon ; and the Death of Hector , which giving perfect satisfaction to Achilles , leads to the entire unravelling of the Action, and disposes Achilles to relent at Priam's Tears, and to return to his first Tranquility. 5\. The end is just contrary .] To find the true Definition of the End , we need only reverse the Conditions, which are given to the Beginning , and take the contrary Sense; for the End is that which is followed by nothing, and is necessarily preceded by something. The Beginning and the Middle precede the End , but nothing ought to follow it; so that whatever comes after the finishing of an Action, is not only Unprofitable, but Vitious, and offends directly against this Definition of Aristotle's . If there are Poets who have offended, by giving a Beginning to the Beginning, there are others who have transgress'd, by adding an End to the End. And such is Statius's Fault, who after the Death of the two Brothers, whose Quarrel was the Subject of his Poem, troubles himself to relate what became of Creon , for whom the Reader had no concern. There are these Faults in our Modern Poets, which any one may remark in reading them. 6\. The Middle is that which supposes something which ought to precede it, and requires something which ought to follow .] We must not imagine that Aristotle takes any needless trouble to define so exactly things which were very well known, for the Offences which are often committed against this Definition, are a certain sign, that what he defines, is not so well known as we think it is. According to this Doctrine of Aristotle , the Middle ought not to have for it self either Beginning or End, but it ought to have respect to the beginning of the Principal Action, of which it ought to be the effect, and to terminate in the end, of which it ought to be a Cause; and consequently all those Middle Parts , which are entire by themselves, that is to say, which suppose nothing before them nor require nothing after them, are no part of an Action; They are forreign, and don't belong to the Subject of the Poem. Such is Statius's History of Hypsipyla , which is altogether independant from the Theban Action, and makes something Entire, from the rest. The same is to be found in many Poems; for our greatest Wits could not prevent falling into this defect. 7\. Those who would manage, a Subject well, can neither begin, nor end it, when they please .] This is a Consequence, which is necessarily drawn from what has been established. If a Poet, will succeed he must not make his Beginning, where something ought necessarily to precede, nor give an end to his Action, when something must of necessity follow; for by that he entirely overthrows, the Oeconomy of the Subject, and makes a Beginning, or End, where there is only a Middle. 8\. Add to this, that whatever is fine, among Animals, or other beings, if it is Composed of Parts, ought not only to be in order, but it ought also to have a just and reasonable Magnitude .] After having explained the Parts of an Action, which ought to make the Subject of a Poem, and shew'd the Order, and relation which they ought to have to one another, he undertakes, to explain its extent, and the Just Magnitude which should be given to it, and to that end, he produces a very good Comparison, which no less proves what he has said, than what he is going to say. 9\. If it is Composed of Parts .] For Aristotle knew, there were Beings, which not being Composed of Parts, could not from thence draw their beauty, nor Order, nor Grandeur, nor Symmetry, such are Angels, Spirits, and God himself 10\. ' Tis for this reason that nothing which is too little can be fine.] Aristotle maintains this Truth in the Fourth Book of his Morals also, where to undeceive the People, and bring them out of the Error in which they were, in believing that young People, altho' they were little, yet they might be fine, provided they were of a well proportion'd Shape; for he tells how we ought to call them. Magnanimity , says he, Doth consist [illeg.] in the greatness of the Soul, as Beauty doth in that of the Body. Young People who are little, may be called Handsome and Well-shap'd, but they may not be called fine . It is not possible then, that beauty, which Plato so justly called, The most Transcendant and Aimable of all things, can ever be found in that which is little. 11\. Because the Sight is confounded in an object which we see as it were in an insensible Moment ] This is a wonderful Reason, for 'tis taken from Nature it self. The Pleasure which the Sight of any Object gives, is not Pleasure, which is produced in a Moment; it is necessary that the Eye, run over all the Parts, and view the Resemblances and Proportions; and this is what a small Object will not allow, it is seen as it were in an insensible space of time; there is no succession of Time or Place, as we may say, and [illeg.] the Visual Rays being contracted into so small a Compass, must needs be Jumbled and Confounded. 12\. What is too great, cannot be fine neither. If the Eye is confounded by an Object which is too small, because it is all seen, in too short time; it is lost in an Object too great, because it can see it only by many repeated Views and can't contract all the Parts into one view whereby it may be capable of judging of. Aristotle pursues this Maxim so far in the seventh Book of his Politicks, that he proves by the same reason that no Dominion can be fine that is, Happy, and well Governed, which is either too Little or too Great. If it is too little, rle, it will be Weak; if it is too Great it will not Enjoy an Orderly Government; God only being able to rule any State of such extent; tent; wherefore it ought to have a due magnitude. And the Measure of this Largeness is, when all the People who compose it, [illeg.] be known to him who Governs, and be [illeg.] led by the same Laws. If Aristotle was in the right, as Theory perswades us, his disciple Alexander made but bad use of his Lessons. 13\. So ought the Subjects of Dramatick Pieces, to have such an extent, that that the Memory may receive, and retain them without trouble .] For what the Eye is to visible Objects, the Memory is to Intellectual; as the Eye must comprehend and measure the Parts of an Object, without trouble, to find it fine, so must the Memory receive and retain, without being burthen'd, all the Parts of the Subject of a Tragedy, to know its Beauty. If it should be too little, the Mind would have no Pleasure in considering it: If it should be too great, it would not apprehend it all together, and the Memory would very difficultly retain it. This Precept of Aristotle's , is founded on Nature, and on the the Practice of the Ancients. Let us see for Example, the Subject of the Oedipus of Sophocles , where we shall find that just Magnitude, which Aristotle requires. The Scene opens with a Sacrifice which a great Number of Thebans are making in the Court of Oedipus's Palace. That Prince enters, and to comfort the People, tells them, That he had sent Creon a long time ago to enquire of Apollo's Oracle at Delphos , the means of making the devouring Pestilence cease, upon which Creon arrives and relates what the Oracle had said: Oedipus sends for Tiresias to explain it. The Prophet at first refused to do it; but provok'd at last by the Severe Carriage of Oedipus , he accuses him of the Murder of Laius. Oedipus imagines that 'twas Creon made him do this: Creon complains of this Injustice, so the two Princes Quarrel: Jocasta comes in to appease them, and endeavours to remove the Uneasiness, which the Reproach that was cast on Oedipus , gave him; but all what she said served only to augment his Trouble. A Messenger enters from Corinth , who brought the News of the Death of King Polybius , who was thought to be his Father; and to remove some Fears which he had upon account of his suppos'd defiling his Mothers Bed, he tells him, That the King and Queen of Corinth were not his Parents; he was resolved to know the Matter throughly, and enquires of the Shepherd, who alone was able to give him a perfect Account of his Misfortunes: The Shepherd leaves him no room to doubt of all his Crimes, and then he Punishes himself. This is the entire Plan of the Oedipus , even with the Episodes too. There is nothing in it but what may be seen at once, and which the Memory may easily retain. The Subjects of Epick Poems are neither longer, nor more embarrass'd, as we shall see in what follows. 14\. Now the precise measure of this extent in what regards the duration of the Representation, and the attention of the Spectators, cannot be determin'd by certain and fixt Rules.] Aristotle was very sensible, that after having spoke of the extent of the Subject of Tragedy, the Reader would define that he should also regulate the time of the duration of the Representation; but this is what he would not engage himself in, because 'tis impossible to give certain Rules to it: The duration of the Representation, depends on the Nature of the Poem, as we shall see in what follows. A Tragedy, to be perfect, ought not to occupy more or less time for the Action, than for the Representation, for then it has all the Circumstances of Probability. The Greek Tragedians always practis'd it, they look't on it as an indispensable Law, which ought never to be transgress'd, they have sometimes missed their incidents in such a manner, as [illeg.] would by no means perswade any to imitate. 15\. For Example: If an hundred Tragedies were to be play'd in one Day, we must measure the time by the Hour-glass .] This is the true reason which hinder'd Aristotle from speaking his Mind before: He explains himself with some uneasiness, and his words contain a sharp Reflexion on the Athenians , who were so bewitch't to Shows, that they were never tir'd of them, and caus'd twelve or sixteen Tragedies to be Acted in one Day; for they had established Plays where three or four Poets disputed the Prize of Poetry, every one of them had four Tragedies, of which the last was a Satyrical Piece. Wherefore those which were composed on those Occasions, were ordinarily shorter than the others, which were Acted more regularly, and to which they gave a greater Attention. What occasion then (says Aristotle ) is there to give Rules for the duration of the Representation, when I have to do with a People, who, if the Fancy takes them, will to Morrow require an hundred Pieces for one Day, and oblige the Poets to make their Poems of such a length, as they ought to have according to the time which is allow'd to represent them in. 16\. As they say it was formerly practis'd .] This is the only Passage I know which shows that the Ancient Greeks caused their Plays to be Acted by the Hour-glass. From Aristotle's time that Custom was abolish't, and was observ'd only at the Bar, as was practis'd afterwards among the Romans , where two Hours were given to the Plaintiff, and three to the Defendant. The Athenians at last saw the Folly of measuring out the Time to the Poets, who took Pains to divert them. 17\. And assuredly the larger extent any Piece has, the finer it will be, provided it be not so large, that the Subject cannot be comprehended all at once, and so the prospect of it be amaz'd and confounded .] I was willing in these last words to express all the force of the Text, ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , by which Aristotle manifestly alludes to what he had said before, ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , Because we do not see it all at once . A Piece ought to encrease no longer, than till its Subject hath all, which it ought to have, to be seen all at once without confounding the Sight, which it will infallibly do, if it is too little; or without causing it to wander, as certainly it will, if 'tis too great. This, in my Opinion, is the true Sense of this Passage. 18\. That is to say, that a Piece to have its just extent, ought to take up so much time, as it must necessarily, or probably do, rightly to induce the Incidents .] To make a good Tragedy, which shall be a true Imitation, the Action which is Imitated ought not in reality to be longer than the Representation, for so the Representation is more like, and consequently more perfect. The three Greek Tragedians have most an end kept within these Bounds, and have given to their Actions only so much Time as is necessary to Represent them. When they could not Reduce them to this exactly (which very seldom happen'd) they had Recourse to the plain Veri-similitude; that is, not being able to give to the Representation all the Time, which the Truth of the Action did necessarily require; they shortned that Time, and were satisfy'd so to manage it, that the Audience might think that all the Incidents of their Pieces could happen in the Time which they suppos'd. It is true, that in endeavouring to keep to the Veri-imilitude, they have sometimes strangely offended against it. Euripides in his Suppliants , and Æ schylus in his Agamemnon , have made their Heroes Act, what is impossible to do in the time they assign them, which is much too short; but the Violence they offer to the Incidents, and the Law they have made, which obliges them to follow this Rule, prove, that there was an indispensable Necessity, and will convince those who will give themselves the trouble to reflect on it, That the Rule of twenty four or thirty Hours, which they would establish at this time, is monstrous, and ruines all the Beauty of a Dramatick Poem; and 'tis also what the Ancients never knew. In a word, the Representation, should neither be longer nor shorter than the Action it imitates. But as there are Actions of ten or twelve Hours, and 'tis impossible to make the Representation of them so long; then indeed not to deprive the Theatre of its Subjects, we may bring in some of the Incidents in the Intervals only, the better to deceive the Audience, who will not pry so narrowly, as to mind what is behind the Scenes; provided there be nothing too Extravagant; and that the Poet conducts himself with Art and Measure. And therefore Aristotle supply'd the Defect of Necessity, by the Probability. This Probability may be preserv'd, tho' we should put into four Hours, what really was Acted in ten; but it is impossible not to transgress it, when we crowd into so short a Space, what took up four and twenty or thirty Hours. Such long Actions can never be the Subject of Tragedy; because in the Representation, the Poet can never bring in the Incidents, either Necessarily or Probably. Thus Aristotle hath said, That all those Actions are without the Rules, since they are not contained in the Space of a Day. You may see what has been Remark'd on the Fifth Chapter. The Unity of the Subject, and in what it Consists. The Errors of some Ancient Poets in that Vnity. How Homer knew it. An Elogy of that Poet. The Integrity of the Action: And what ought to be the Connexion between all its parts. only : or as we see every day an infinity of Accidents, of the greatest part of which, we can make nothing that is one; it happens also that the Actions of the same Man, are so many and different, that we can never reduce them to this Unity, and make of them one and the same Action. 2\. For this Reason it seems to me, that all the poets, who have made the Heracleids , or the Theseids , or any such like Poems, are deceived very much; for they were in the wrong, to think, that because Theseus was one, and Hercules was one, that all  102 their Lives ought only to make one Subject, one Fable; and that the unity of the Hero made the unity of the Action. 3\. Homer , who excell'd other Poets in all respects, seems to me perfectly to have known the defect , either by  103 the natural sagacity of his happy Genius, or by the Rules of Art; so in Composing his Odysses , he has not mention'd all the Adventures of Ulysses : For example, he has not mixt the Wound he receiv'd on Parnassus , with his feigned Madness, when the Greeks assembled their Army: For, because one of them happen'd, 'tis neither necessary, nor probable, that the other should also happen; but he has employed all that could have respect to one only and the same Action, as is that of the Odysses . He hath follow'd the same in his Iliads. 4\. As then in all other Imitations,  104 what is imitated is one, so in Tragedy, since the Fable is imitation of an Action, that Action must be one and entire; and whose different parts are so link'd together, that if you transpose them, or take only one away, the whole will be entirely changed, or destroy'd: For whatever can be put in, or left out, without causing a sensible change, cannot be a part of an Action. 1\. The Subject ought to be one, and not, as many think, taken from one person only. ] Aristotle refutes the Error of those who pretended the unity of the Hero made the unity of the Action; and that if the Poem comprehended only the Actions of one Man, it kept unity, and was within the Rules. There is nothing falser, as this Philosopher proves very solidly. But is there no Poem, say you, where there are many Actions? Who doubts it: But there is only one which is independant, and doth not make a part of the Principal Action, which ought to have several subordinate ones. As Aristotle said, it is in Poetry as in Painting; a Painter puts many Actions into one Piece; but those Actions form only one entire perfect one. A Poet uses many Epicodes, but all those Epicodes taken by themselves finish nothing, they are but imperfect members, which make together one and the same Action. 2\. For, as we see every day an Infinity of Accidents, of the greatest part of which we can make nothing that is one; it happens also, that the Actions of the same Man are so many and different, &c.] Aristotle means that what generally happens in the World, in different times, and places, is not sometimes more different than the Actions of one Man: So that 'twould be almost as ridiculous to endeavour to make one Action of all the Actions of the World, as to reduce the Adventures of this one Man to Unity. 3\. For this reason it seems to me, that all the Poets who have made the Heracleide, or the Theseide, or any such like Poems, are deceived very much .] It appears by this passage, that in Aristotles time there were many Poems as vicious, as the Heracleids , and Theseids , which comprehended all the Actions of their Hero's; 'Tis an astonishing thing, that after so just and solemn a Censure, and grounded on Examples which are so solid, and of such great Authority, as the two Poems of Homer , from which Virgil himself thought he ought not to wander, that Statius should be guilty of the fault in his Achilleids , which is here condemn'd by Aristotle ; for he has not chosen one Action, as Homer and Virgil , but has taken in all the Actions of Achilles , and describ'd him entirely. Probably Statius had not read Aristotle's Art of Poetry ; for at all times ill Poets, who have presum'd too much on their own knowledge, have neglected to instruct themselves in the Rules of their Art, and wrote without knowing them. But you may say, he had read Homer's and Virgil's Poems: Yes, he had read them, just as some do now; that is, without discovering the beauty of that marvellous Conduct, and yet think themselves able to write much more perfectly. This proves very well the truth of what has been said in Horace's Art of Poetry, That none can be an excellent Poet without Art . It is necessary that the best natural parts be Polish'd, Enrich'd, Strengthen'd, and Assisted, by Study; for without its help, they are generally rash and blind. We have a very remarkable example in our time: Mr. Corneille had, without doubt, one of the greatest Genius's for the Theatre that ever was seen; when he began to write, he not only had not read the Rules of a Dramatick Poem, but did not know there were any; as he confesses in one of his Prefaces. We need only compare one of those Pieces which were made, as we may say, in his time of Ignorance, with any of those which he made, after he had been by long study instructed in those Rules. 4\. Homer, who excell'd all other Poets in all respects, seems to me perfectly to have known the defect, either by the natural sagacity of his happy Genius, or by the Rules of Art.] Aristotle would not decide the Famous Question, Whether Homer be the first Author of Epick Poem? or whether he wrote after others, who opened the way to him? If it was the first, he must apprehend by the force of his Genius alone, that an Epick Poem ought to comprehend one Action of the Hero only. If he followed others, then there was an Art known, of which he might follow the Rules. 5\. For Example, he has not mixt the Wound he receiv'd on Parnassus, with his feign'd Madness, where the Greeks assembled their Army .] If such a Poet as Statius had made the Odysses , he would not have failed to set forth all Ulysses Actions, and consequently would not have forgot the cunning trick he used to exempt himself from going to the Siege of Troy ; but Homer is not fallen into that fault, he saw that that counterfeit Madness had no connexion either in Truth, or Probability, with the Subject of his Poem; and therefore he says not one word of it. He has dealt otherwise with the Wound Ulysses received at Parnassus ; for although that Wound was no more to the Matter of his Poem, than the Madness he feigned when the Greeks assembled themselves, yet however he has not omitted speaking of it, because he found an opportunity of inserting it so naturally in his Principal Action, that it becomes a necessary part of it, since it causes a remembrance of that Hero. The Story in few words is thus: When Ulysses was young, he went to see his Grandfather Autolycus who had some Land near Parnassus: Autolycus , desirous to divert his Grandson, ordered his Children to go a Hunting with him on mount Parnassus . The Dogs had seized a Boar, Ulysses came first in with him, and was wounded by his Tusks below the Knee; Homer makes a wonderful use of this Adventure of Ulysses ; for that [illeg.]ce being arriv'd at Penelope's Palace, unknown, she orders Euryclea to wash that Princes Feet; ulysses perceiving that the Woman who had bred him would know the Scar, went into a dark place that he might not be discovered; but all his precautions were in vain, for Euryclea knew the wound by the touch: So this History, which is related at length, in the Nineteenth Book of the Odysses , far from being a Foreign Epicode , becomes very naturally the manner of joyning it to the Subject; for word necessary to give an account of that remembrance which followed. With his feigned Madness, when the Greeks assembled their Army .] They Write that Ulysses , to excuse himself from going to the Trojan War, called himself a Fool; that he went to Plow with [illeg.] and an Horse: Palamedes suspected the Counterfeit, and to be assur'd that it was so, he took Telemachus , who was in his Cradle, and put him under the Plow-Wheels; Ulysses could not continue his Furrow without Killing his Son, so stopt, and discover'd the Trick. If this particular had been as glorious to Ulysses , as it is unworthy him, and little agreeable to his Character, Homer would certainly never have forgot it. 7\. For because one of them happen'd, 'tis neither necessary, nor probable, that the other should also happen .] This Passage is very important; for Aristotle most evidently teaches, of what Nature the different parts, which a Poet uses to form one and the same Action, ought to be: They ought to be the necessary, or probable, consequences of one another, as the remembrance of Ulysses was of his Wound. Every Adventure then, which hath not this connexion, and relation, with some part of the Matter of the Poem, ought to be rejected as Foreign, and which breaks the unity of the Action and therefore Homer took care not to interrupt the unity of his Odysses , by the Epicode of the Madness which Ulysses feigned; for that Incident could never be produc'd by any of those which were necessary and proper to the Poem, nor produce any which had the least relation to them. Our Er[illeg.] Tragedies oftentimes offend against this Rule, [illeg.] and I have remark'd the same faults in the Greek Tragedians. We shall speak of this, when we shall have occasion to explain what an Epicodick fable is. 8\. But he has employed all that could have respect to one only and the same Action, as is that of the Odysses; and he hath followed the same in his Iliads There is not one Epicode , in the Iliads , or Odysses which hath not the three Conditions requir'd of a good one; they are proper to the Subject, are drawn from the ground of the Fable: They are so joyn'd with the Principal Action, that one is a necessary Consequence of the other, either truly or probably. And to conclude, they are in themselves imperfect Members, which do not make a compleat and finish'd Body; for an Epicode , which makes a Compleat Action, can't be one part of the Principal Action. 9\. As then in all other Imitations, what is imitated is one, so in Tragedy .] After having assur'd us, that Tragedy ought to imitate one Action alone, he confirms his opinion by the example of all other Imitations, ev'ry one of which proposes to imitate only one thing; as Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, and all other Arts and Imitations, of which he has spoken in the beginning of this Art of Poetry. Parachasius , who Painted the Madness which Ulysses counterfeited among the Grecian Princes, corrupted the Unity of his Action, by the mixture of the Wound which that Prince received at Parnassus . It is so of all others; Tragedy can have no peculiar privilege in this case; for since it is an Imitation, it must follow the nature of all other Imitations. 10\. Whose different parts are so link'd together, that if you transpose them, or take only one away, the whole will be entirely chang'd or destroy'd .] In a Dramatick , as well as in an Epick Poem, when the subject is once well form'd, that all the parts which compose it are in their proper places, and the Epicodes so depending on one another, that the first are the occasion of the latter, it is impossible to transpose, or take away any one part, without changing, or destroying the whole Action. If we should transpose, for example, one of the Epicodes of Sophocles's Oedipus , the Action could no longer [illeg.]sist, or it must be double. We may see the same in the Iliads ; If Achilles should become tractable, and receive satisfaction from Agamemnon before the death of Patroclus , 'twould destroy the unity of the Subject entirely; Homer would have two Angers and two Revenges to sing off. 11\. For whatever can be put in, or left out, without causing a sensible change, cannot be part of the Action .] That which is a Member of a Body, is by no means indifferent to that Body; and it makes a very sensible change, when it is either taken away, or added. All that then which can be omitted, or added, to a Subject, with a perceptible alteration, can in no wise be a necessary part of that Subject. This is a very sure Rule, to distinguish the true Epicodes from the false; these last add nothing to the Principal Action, when they are added; and diminish nothing of it, when they are omitted. Such is the History of Hypsipyla in Statius's Thebaids , which add nothing to the Subject; nor will the Subject lose any thing, tho' you leave that out. The Poet ought to follow the Truth, or veri-similitude. The difference between a Poet and an Historian. The advantages Poetry has over History. If Tragedy may invent the Names of all the Persons. An example drawn from the Tragedy of Agathon. If we must always follow the Fables which are received. How a Poet is Master of his Subject. Whether a true History may be the Subject of Tragedy. What Epicodick Fables are. And why good Poets have sometimes been Guilty of that Error. Surprize is necessary to Tragedy. How the Fable ought to produce this surprize. The History of the Statue of Mitys. 1\. By what we have already said, it is easie to discern, that 'tis not the  105 Property of a Poet, to relate things just as they came to pass, but as they might, or ought necessarily or probably to happen. For an Historian, and a Poet don't differ in that one Writes in Prose, and the other in Verse; for truly Herodotus 's History might very well be put into Verse, and twould be no less in a History when in Verse, than 'tis now in Prose. But they differ in this, that an Historian Writes what did happen, and a Poet what might, or ought to have , come to pass. 'Tis for this reason that Poetry is more  106 Solid and Moral than History, because it treats of general, and History relates only particular things; a general thing, is that, which every Man, of such or such a Character, necessarily or probably ought to say, or do, which is the aim of Poesy, even when it imposes Names on the Persons. A particular thing is, for Example , what Alcibiades has done or suffer'd. 3\. This is already render'd very  107 sensible in Comedy; for the Comick Poets, after having drawn up their Subject on probability, impose what Names they please on their Persons, and don't imitate the  108 Satyrical Poets, who confine themselves to particulars only. 4\. 'Tis true, that the Tragick Poets make use of  109 true Names; but the reason of that is, because whatever is possible  110 is credible; now what never happen'd, does not always appear possible; whereas we cannot doubt, but that which hath been already done, may be possible, (without any difficulty) since it could not have been, if it had been impossible. 5\. It falls out however very often, that in Tragedies we are contented with one or two Names which are known, and all the other invented. There are also Pieces where not one Name is known, as in the Tragedy of Agathon , which he calls the Flower ; for in that Piece, all the Names are feign'd, as the things are too, and yet it pleases. 6\. 'Tis not therefore  111 necessary, always to tye up ones self scrupulously to follow known Fables, from whence the Subject of Tragedies are generally drawn, that would be ridiculous; for what is known, is ordinarily so by few, and yet nevertheless it equally pleases all. 7\. By this it is evident, that a Poet ought  112 to be the Author of his Subject, as much as  113 of his Verse, especially , since he imitates Actions, and is a Poet only by Imitation;  114 and when he also exposes true Incidents on the Stage, he no less deserves the Name of a Poet, since nothing hinders, but that the Incidents which did really happen, may have all the veri-similitude, and all possibility which Art requires, and which may cause him to be look'd on as the Author and Poet. 8\. The Epicodick are the  115 most imperfect of all simple Fables and Actions. I call a Fable Epicodick , which hath Epicodes that are not joyn'd one with another, either truly, or probably. Ill Poets  116 fall into this Error by their Ignorance, and the good by their Complaisance to 117 the Actors; for as  118 there are always Jealousies between the different Companies of Comedeans , who dispute the Prize: The Poets, to let the Actors appear , stretch and violate their Subjects, and Consequently, are very often forc'd to break the Unity of its parts. 9\.  119 Tragedy is not only the Imitation of an entire Action, but of  120 such an Action as excites Terror and Compassion; now these two Passions come by surprize, when some things are produc'd out of others, contrary to our ex- spectations. For the Wonderful is much more to be seen in these than in those which happen without design, and by chance; since even in those things which Fortune Conducts, these which seem to come to pass designedly, and are by a particular direction, are always much more surprizing and wonderful; as it happen'd to the statue of Mitys at Argos , which, in the middle of a great Feast , fell on his Murderer, and kill'd him  121 on the spot. For  122 it did not seem upon any account to happen by accident. It necessarily follows from hence, that those Fables, when this Conduct is observed , will always appear the finest. 1\. By what I have already said, it is easie to discern, that 'tis not the property of a Poet to relate things just as they came to pass, but as they might, or ought, necessarily or probably happen.] Aristotle having taught that Tragedy is the Imitation of one single Action, that that Action ought to be perfect and entire; and that all the parts which compose it, ought to be so link'd together, that no one can either be transpos'd, or taken away, without changing, or destroying the whole, draws from those Principles the following consequence; It is easie to discern , that 'tis not the Property of a Poet, to relate things just as they came to pass .] In effect, if any Poet should oblige himself to relate things just as they really happen'd. his Action would not have the necessary extent, he could give it neither that beginning, middle, nor end, which Aristotle requires in an Action; and what is yet more considerable, as he could not know all the Causes and Motives of the Incidents which compos'd it, he could not make his Incidents so dependent one on another, that the first should be the cause of the latter; the Reason is plain, for a prodigious number of things happen every day, of which we know not the Causes, especially those which concern Monarchs, which are properly the Subjects of Tragedy. Now a Poet is obliged to explain all the Causes of the incidents which enter into the Composition of the Subject; and as 'tis just to let him be Master of his Matter, so it should not be required of him to speak things as they are, but as they may, or ought to be, provided he follows either Necessity, or Probability; for nothing more can be requ ired of him. All this Chapter is of great importance; and I shall endeavour to make it as plain and clear as possible. 2\. Necessarily, or Probably .] Necessity and Probability, are very often not found in those things which do really happen, because we are Ignorant of the Causes which have produc'd those Effects. 3\. For an Historian and a Poet don't differ in that one Writes in Prose, and the other in Verse .] In order to maintain what he has said, he goes on to shew the difference between a Poet and an Historian; this difference doth not consist, in one's Writing in Verse, and the other in Prose; for if Herodotus 's History should be put into Verse, it would be still an History in Verse; and if the Iliads was turn'd into Prose, it would, for all that, be a Poem in Prose; there must then be some more essential difference, and which does not proceed from the Manner, but the Matter; and this is what he is going to explain. 4\. But they differ in this, That an Historian Writes what did happen, and a Poet what might, or ought to have, come to pass .] An Historian doth not make his Matter, he speaks only what he knows, and no more is required of him, provided he keep to the truth. 'Tis not so with the Poet; as he is Author of his Matter, he follows only truth or veri-similitude, that is to say, That all which he relates, may or ought to happen as he relates it; and if he does at any time take any thing from History, 'tis only so far as it can accommodate him, and that is, furnishes Subjects, as he would have feign'd them, otherwise he may change all that is not convenient for him. 5\. 'Tis for this Reason that Poetry is more Solid, and Moral, than History; because it treats of general, and History relates only particular things .] There is nothing more solid and real, than the Advantage Aristotle gives here to Poetry, over History; but we must not imagine that he had only a design to extol the excellence of that Art, he would also make known its Nature: Poetry , says he, is more grave and Phylosophick than History ; for that is the term he uses. For truly History can instruct no further than the Facts it relates give an opportunity, and as those Facts are particular, it very rarely happens that they are suitable to those who read them, and there is not one of a Thousand to whom they agree; and those to whom they do agree, have not perhaps in all their Lives two occasions, on which they can draw any advantage from what they have Read. 'Tis not so with Poetry, that keeps close to Generals, and it is so much the more Instructive and Moral, as General things surpass Particulars; these agree to one only, those to all the World: Besides, 'tis not the Facts which instruct, 'tis the Causes of those Facts. The Historian very rarely recounts the Causes of what he relates, for they are almost alway kept secret; and if he does explain them, 'tis rather conjectures which he gives, than certain truths. But the Poet being Master of his Matter, advances nothing for which he doth not give a very good Reason; and there is not so much as a small Incident, of which he doth not lay open the Causes, and Effects. In the Third place, History hath a bare Relation, Poetry hath Action, because it is an Imitation; ev'ry thing is animated in Tragedy. Now what is only related in order to be understood, affects us much less, than what we see with our Eyes. Fourthly, History is solitary and cold, whereas Poetry associates with Natural Philosophy and Theology; and borrows assistance from the Passions. We may find many other advantages which Poetry has over History; But what I have said, may suffice to shew that Aristotle perfectly well understood the nature of these two Arts, when he said, that one was more Moral and Philosophical than the other. Horace has said more than Aristotle ; for he asserts, that an Epick Poem (which without contradiction is inferiour to Tragedy in that respect) is more Philosophical than Philosophy it self; for that is what he means by these Verses, of the 2d Epist . of the first Book , Qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non, Plenius & melius Chrysippo, & Crantore dicit. Homer told plainer than Crantor did, Or than Chrysippus , what things were forbid, What fit to show, and what ought to be hid. and truly Poetry has almost the same advantage over Philosophy, as it has over History: But there is no necessity of proving that. 6, A general thing is that, which every Man, of such or such a Character, necessarily or probably, ought to say or do .) To shew that an Action which makes the subject of Tragedy, is not a particular, but a general thing, he defines what a general thing is, and says very well, That 'tis what every Man of the same Character ought to say or do, either necessarily or probably. Thus when Homer wrote the Action of Achilles , he had no design to describe that Man alone who bore that Name, but to set before our Eyes, what Violence and Anger could make all Men of that Character, say, or do. Achilles is then an Universal Person, General and Allegorical; it is so of the Hero's of Tragedy. 7\. Which is the aim of Poetry, even when it imposes Names on the Persons.] Aristotle foresaw an Objection which might be made, against a definition he had given of a general thing: For the Ignorant would not fail to say, that Homer , for Example, had no intention to Write a general and universal Action, but a particular one, since he relates what some certain Men, as Achilles, Agamemnon , and Ulysses, &c . had done; and consequently there is no difference between Homer and an Historian who should Write the Actions of Achilles . The Philosopher prevents this Objection, by shewing that the Poets, i.e. the Authors, of a Tragick or Epick Poem, at the same time they give Names to their Persons, don't think at all of making them speak truly, which they would be obliged to do, if they wrote the particular and real Action of a certain Man, called Achilles , or Oedipus , but they propose to make them speak and act, necessarily, or probably; that is to say, to make them speak and do, all that Men of the same Character would say or do in the same Circumstances, either of necessity, or according to the rules of veri-similitude, which proves uccontrolably, that they are general and universal Actions: What follows will set this truth in a better light. 8\. This is already render'd very sensible in Comedy; for the Comick Poets, after having drawn up their Subject on Probability, impose what Names they please on their Persons .] To confirm what he had said of Tragedy, That at the very time it imposes Names on the Persons, it has only general and universal prospects; he says, that it is rendred very sensible by what is done in Comedy. No body doubts that the Action of a Comedy is a feign'd and allegorical Action, since the intention of the Poet is to describe the manners of his own times. Now a Comick Poet goes thus to work; first, he invents and disposes his Subjects, which he endeavours to render as probable as possibly he can. Then he gives Names to his Persons of his own invention, and just as he pleases. Since then the Action which is in a Comedy, and attributed to one certain Person, doth not cease to be a general thing, and of which all are agreed, Why should it be more difficult to conceive that tis the same in the Action of a Tragedy, tho' under true Names? 'Tis equal, and the proof is sure. He goes on to explain, why Tragedy does rather employ true than feigned Names; as for what remains, when Aristotle says, that Comedy intents first its Subjects, and then gives the Names according to its fancy, we may believe that he speaks neither of the old nor of the middle Comedy. For the first invented neither Subjects, nor names; and the latter, though it might invent the subjects, yet did not invent the Names but of the new Comedy, which was only in use in his time, the old, and mean, being both forbidden. 'Tis certain Aristotle saw the establishment of the new Comedy; for how could he do otherwise since he survived Alexander , under whose Reign the new Comedy began? He also speaks of it in his Morals. But I don't believe, however, that he speaks here only of this last sort of Comedy, I am perswaded that he speaks of Comedy in general; for although the old and mean Comedy, brought the real Adventures of the chief Citizens on the Stage, and the Old under their true Names, it may, notwithstanding this, be true, that the Poet invented the plan, and the disposition of his Subject, and that afterwards he gave either true or false Names to his Persons. When Aristophanes nam'd his Actors Socrates, Euripides, Cleon, Hyperbolus, Lamach[illeg.] which are true Names, That did not change the Nature of the Subject of the Piece; the Subject is always feign'd, though it has something of truth and is a general and universal thing; when a Tragick Poet, takes the Subject of a Tragedy from a true History, it is general, universal, and allegorical, as all others are which have no truth in them. 9\. And don't imitate the Satyrical Poets, who confine themselves to particulars only .] The Greek has it thus, and don't do as the makers of Iambicks, i.e . as I have already said, as the Satyrical Poets; for the Iambick Verse was devoted to backbiting and Satyr. This is then the difference between the Comick and Tragick Poets, Both of them are Biting; but the Comick Poets keep close to general and the Satyrical Poets to particular things. When Archilochus would bespatter Lycambes , he keeps only to what Lycambes had done, or what he was supposed to have done, and had nothing else in view. It is the same with those who Write Satyr against those whom they make known, under feigned Names only. 10\. Tis true, that the Tragick Poets make use of true Names .] He continues to answer to the Objection which he saw might be brought to destroy what he had advanced, That the Action of a Tragedy is neither Historical nor Particular, but General and Allegorical. It must be confess'd, says he, that Tragedy employs true Names; but that does not destroy the Fiction, which is the foundation of a Dramatick , as well as of an Epick Poem. The Tragick Poets, as those who make Epopoeias , have their reasons for what they do, which shall be explained in what follows. 11\. But the reason of that is, that whatever is possible, is credible .] That which obliges the Tragick Poets to give to their Persons true and known Names, is the better to perswade us, that the Action which they attribute to them, is possible and true; for the Audience easily believes that the Thing is as true as the Name. These true Names furnish the Poets also with another conveniency, that they give them an opportunity to make use of the real Adventures of those Persons which are known, and which they accommodate to the grounds of the Fable they treat of, and from which they draw such Ingenious Episodes, that renders the Action more probable, (though 'tis feigned) and make it pass for true History; this is the great address of Homer , and the Tragick Poets of Greece. 12\. It falls out however very often, that, in Tragedies, we are not contented with one or two Names which are known, and all the other invented .] As what he hath already said, That the Tragick Poets employ names which are known, might perswade us, that there is an indispensable necessity of putting true Names into the Fable of Tragedy, he takes Care to Advertise us, that the Poets were very often contented to employ one or two Names which are true, though all the other were false; and truly one or two Names which are known, are enough to make all the other pass. 13\. There are also Pieces, in which not one Name is known. ] Aristotle goes yet further, and by the example of Agathon , shews us, that a Tragick Poet has the liberty to invent, as well the Names as the Things; the other way is the best, and I would advise to follow it, as being preferable. 14\. As in the Tragedy of Agathon, which he calls the Flower .] This Agathon Liv'd in the Times of Eupolis and Aristophanes , we don't know what was the Nature of that Piece which Aristotle speaks of, nor why it was called the Flower ; that Poet was very well qualified for a Tragedian, yet he was Guilty of considerable Faults, for which some of his Pieces were damn'd, as we shall see in the 19th. Chap. 15\. In that Piece, all the Names are feigned, as the Things are .] He means, that there was not one Name which was true; and that all the Parts of the Fable were the Poets invention, without any Incident drawn from a known Subject. 16\. ' Tis not therefore necessary, always to tye up ones self Scrupulously, to follow known Fables, from whence the Subjects of Tragedy are generally drawn .] The success which that Piece of Agathon had, incourages Aristotle to declare boldly, that Tragick Poets have the liberty to invent new Subjects, and new Names, and truly there is nothing hinders, why those invented Pieces should not succeed, as well as those whose Subjects are known: Horace was of the same opinion, but thought himself obliged to inform the Romans , that those invented Pieces were much more difficult to manage than the others; and to advise them at the same time, rather to keep to those Subjects which are known. Difficile est proprie Comunia dicere, tuque Rectius Iliacum Carmen deduces in actus, Quam si preferres ignota, indictaq; primus. 'Tis much more safe, known Subjects for to chuse, Then your own Thoughts in Publick to produce. For general things are hard to imitate. and afterwards in speaking of these Satyrical Pieces, he says, Ex noto fictum Carmen sequor. And feigned Verse, I will from true produce. Aristotle had not the same reason to give such advice to the Greeks ; for they had such a Genius for Tragedy, that nothing was impossible to them. We see that the first, who dar'd to go out of the Common Road, and try, what Horace afterwards found so difficult, for the Romans , did it with such success, that it deserves to be proposed as a Model. 17\. That would be Ridiculous .] He means, That such a scruple as should keep a Poet only to old Fables, for fear that a new Invented Subject will not succeed, would be intirely Ridiculous, and this is the reason. 18\. For what is known, is ordinarily so by few, and yet nevertheless, it equally pleases all .] If those Subjects, which were known, were only capable of pleasing, certainly they could please but very few, and those only who understood and knew the History from whence those Subjects were taken. Oedipus and Electra of Sophocles ; The Phedra and Iphigenia of Mr. Racine , would divert the Learned only; but on the contrary we see, that they do extreamly delight the most Ignorant, and those to, who don't so much as know the Names of the Persons; we may be assur'd then, that new Subjects are no less proper for the Theatre than old ones; this proof is certain, for 'tis demonstration. 19\. By this it is evident, that a Poet ought to be the Author of his Subject, as much as of his Verse, especially since he imitates Actions, and is a Poet only by imitation.] Aristotle says, that the Conduct of Poets, in the composition of their Pieces, clearly proves, that they ought to be as much Masters of the Constitution of their Subjects, as of the Composition of their Verse; and surely, the first thing which a Poet doth, is to make the Fable, which is at first general and universal; he afterwards particularizes, by the giving the Names to his Persons; and if any who are known, afford any thing for his Story, he endeavours to accommodate them to his Subject, and to draw some Episode from them, and this is what the Poet doth. The measure of the Verse does not Contribute to him that Name, for he is a Poet by imitation only, since he imitates Actions, and not Words; and instructs by Examples. The very Name of Poet, renders him absolutely Master of his Subject; for Poet signifies properly Maker , if I may use that Term. Now that which is the Principal, in Tragedy or Epick Poem, is the Fable, or the Composition of things; and as that is purely the invention of the Poet, 'tis by it that he has that Name. We may say further, that the Subject belongs to him more than the Verse, in which he follows the Rules which are prescribed; but in the Subject he has an unbounded Liberty, provided he still keeps in view, either what is Necessary, or Probable. 20\. And when he also exposes true Incidents on the Stage, he no less deserves the Name of a Poet .] all what he hath said of Poets, being no Poets, but by Imitation, and that they ought to be Authors of their Subjects; might make us think, that if a Poet should expose a true Action on the Stage, he would cease to be a Poet, because he would not invent his Subject. He prevents that Objection, by asserting that he is no less a Poet for that; for the truth of the Action which he relates, does not make him lose that Name, and this is the reason which he gives for't. 21\. Since nothing hinders, but the Incidents which did really happen, may have all the veri-similitude, and all the Possibility which Art requires .] What doth a Poets Art require? It requires, that he give to his Subjects, all the probability which is possible. Now that probability is not incompatible with the truth; and that which does really come to pass, may be also as probable, and possible, as that which is feign'd and even such as the Poet would have invented. The truth of the Matter of Fact, doth never destroy the nature of the Fable; and he is a Poet: Aristotle is satisfied with this Reason, which is drawn from the nature of the Subject, and very convincing; he might have added another which appears to me very Solid, and is, that the truth of any Point of History, which a Poet undertakes to Manage, doth not exclude the Art of Poetry, who hath always the Power to dispose of his Subject, and to order the Plan, in such a Manner, that the Fable be still the Soul of the Poem; 'tis this Oeconomy, and just Connexion of things, which do properly Contribute to Dramatick Poem, and which is as easie to be done in true Subjects, as in those which are invented. 22\. The Episodick are the most imperfect of all simple Fables, and Actions; I call a Fable Episodick, which hath Episodes, that are not joyn'd one with another, either truly, or probably .] We have seen, that all the Parts which Compose a Tragedy, ought to be well Connexed, and to have a Relation one to another, that if you take away one only, or transpose it, the whole will be intirely changed or destroyed. When any Action, which doth not make a part of the Principal one, is mixed with the Fable, it may be all left out, without making any Breach, or destroying the Action, which makes the Subject of the Poem, which is thereby made better, since it loses only that which was improper and corrupted, its Unity. An Episodick Fable then is, a Fable which has something which is improper, foreign, and superadded, and which may be retrench'd without the Fables losing any thing. These vicious Episodes, are mostly found in simple Fables, because, as they have fewer Incidents, and Parts than others, so they furnish the Poet with less Matter, who is obliged to commit this irregularity, as dextrously as he can, that he may finish five Acts. Mr. Corneille has fallen into this fault, which the Barrenness of the Subjects, often throws the Poets into, though Oedipus was a Complex story, and consequently he might have had Matter enongh, without betaking himself to foreign Episodes. The Love of Theseus and Dirce , is the most vicious of all the Episodes; for it is not only no part of the Action, but it makes an Action by it self, so perfect and entire, that the Piece would be more tolerable, if that was the Principal Action, and the Story of Oedipus only an Episode to it; however Mr. Corneille calls that Love , a Lucky Episode. Aristotle would have judg'd otherwise, and though that Love was capable of furnishing Monstrous Episodes, to the History of Oedipus , which is Compos'd only of Incests, Paricides, and all sorts of Horrors. 23\. And the good, by their Complaisance to the Actors, for as there are always jealousies between the different Companies of Comedians .] I have translated this passage in the sense which seem'd justest and truest, the Complaisance which a Poet has to the Actors whom he would have appear better than others obliges him oftentimes to forsake his Matter that such and such particular Actors have parts to Play [illeg.] thus Multiplying the Number of the Persons, he is forc'd to Corrupt the Unity of the Action by Foreign Episodes. And although at this time, we have neither such disputes nor jealousies betwen the different[illeg.] Companies, yet we see very ill effects of this Complaisance which the Poets shew to the Comedians. 24\. Tragedy is not only the imitation of an entire Action, but of such an Action as excites Terror and Compassion.] Aristotle hath already shewn what an entire and perfect Action is, and what will break its Unity; and in doing that, he has explained the first part of the definition of Tragedy. He now passes to the last part, where he says, That by the means of Terror and Compassion, Tragedy compleatly refines in us all sorts of Passions, and whatever else is like them , and to do this, 'tis necessary that it imitate an Action which is capable of exciting Terror and Compassion; for if it excites any other Passions, the Definition is false, for that Action doth not at all answer the design of Tragedy. It is certain that there can be no Tragedy where Fear and Pity are not excited; and for this Reason Aristotle would have excluded Mr. Corneilles Nicomedes from the number of Tragedies, wherein he only endeavours to stir up Admiration in the minds of the Spectators, and in thus receding from the rules of Aristotle , thought he had discover'd a new way to refine the Passions; for (says he) the Love this Piece creates for the Virtue we admire, imprints in us an Hatred for the contrary Vice; the greatness of Nicomedes's Courage, can leave in us an aversion only for Cowardize . But this way of refining the Passions by Admiration, is in no wise the design of Tragedy; for that Passion is too soft for such a great Effect: Tragedy employs only Terror and Compassion, and leaves Admiration for an Epick Poem, to which it is more necessary and proper, and where it has more time to act on Habitudes and Manners. 25\. Now these two Passions come by surprize .] This is a certain truth; for where there is no Surprize, there is generally neither Fear nor Pity. 26\. When some things are produced out of others, contrary to our expectation .] Because there are many Accidents which may cause surprize, Aristotle took care to explain those which agree to Tragedy. This Poem doth not accommodate it self in any sort to those who are purely Accidental, and which have no Cause that produces them, as a Mans being Crush'd to Pieces by the fall of an House; or Killed by a Stone thrown at Random. The surprize such Accidents causes, are by no means proper to refine the Passions: Because there being no sensible Cause which produced them, we impute it to Blind Chance, and know not how to make any application of them. But the Surprize which Tragedy requires, is that which shews several Incidents that are produced of one another, contrary to the expectation of the Spectator. It was worth remarking, that he did not say, Incidents which come one after another , but Incidents which were produced one of another . For an Incident which comes after another may cause surprize, and yet not have that Relation to the rest that Tragedy requires, but it must necessarily follow from those which preceded, otherwise 'tis not proper for Tragedy. 27\. For the Marvellous is much more to be seen in these, than in those which happen without design, and by chance.] Aristotle advances nothing for which he does not give a very solid, and convincing reason; He tells us here, why Tragedy uses not those Surprizes, which Accidents, that happen without design, and by chance, are the causes of: 'Tis because those which are purely fortuitous, have not that Marvellous , which we find find in those that are produced from Incidents that went before. For truly there is nothing very wonderful in an Houses falling and Crushing a Man to Death, the mind of the Spectator goes not far, in searching the Causes of that Accident, what are hid in the bosom of Providence; he has no other concern on him, than to shew some Sorrow as the Dead Mans Misfortune, such as common Humanity obliges him to have; but when any Surprize come from those things which are produced from one another, that certainly has this Wonderful of which Aristotle here speaks For the Spirit of the Spectator is stricken and fill'd with the Object; he sees at the same time, its Causes, and its end, and 'tis from this double prospect that the wonderful is produced; 'tis thus, it reigns with so great splendor in Homer's Poems, where the Surpize is always the product of the Incidents which are link'd with the foregoing; and to give a proof, yet more sensible, 'tis for this reason, that we find nothing, which is Comparable to the Holy Scripture , for the Marvellous . It is full of very extraordinary Events, which come to pass contrary to the expectation of the Reader; but they are produced by these means which depend on one another, so that when you see the Cause, you see also the Effect. 28\. Since even in those things which Fortune Conducts, those which seem to come to pass designedly, and by a particular direction, are always much more Surprizing and Wonderful .] To prove the truth of what he hath Establish'd, That things which come from a known Cause, contrary to the expectation of the Audience, are more Marvellous and Surprizing than those which arrive casually. He starts a Reason beyond any reply: and which could not have been thought of, by any one, who did not know Nature to the Bottom: He says, that among the Accidents which are purely of Chance, there are some which have the Wonderful he speaks of, and they are always those which happen such a manner, that instead of imputing them to Chance, we are apt to think they fell out on set purpose, and that they were by some guided particular direction, as it happen'd to the Murderer of a certain Man, called Mitys . That Man being sitting under the Statue of him he had slain; the Statue tumbled on him, and Crush'd him to Death. This Accident was Fortunes Conduct; for the Statue had certainly fell at that time, tho' the Murderer had not been there; but the Spectator, who joyns the Cause and the Effect together, is easily perswaded, that it was done designedly, if we may venture so to speak; and that 'twas Mitys himself that was revenged of his Enemy: There is nothing more common, than the thoughts of any one who saw that; both ancient, and modern History, can furnish us with a thousand Examples; every one on such occasions, makes the reflections, which Callimachus did in his Epigram , on the Statue of a cruel Step-mother, which fell on her Son-in-Law and Killed him. ![](/images/inline/Sgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbOHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) . ![](/images/inline/sbEEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/PHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) . A Youth to Crown his Mothers Statue try'd, Thinking with her, her Malice too had dy'd. The Statue on him fell, for so fate dooms, And Kill'd him; Young Man fly such Mothers Tombs. 29\. As it happened to the Statue of Mitys at Argos, which in the Middle of a great Feast, fell down on his Murderer, and Killed him on the Spot.] Plutarch relates this History in his Treatise, why Justice, oftentimes deferrs the Punishment of the Wicked : He says, that Mitys , the Argian , was Killed in a Tumult; and that some Years after, the People of Argos being assembled together to see some Publick Shows, Mitys's Statue, which was made of Brass, tumbled down on his Murderer, and Crush'd him to Pieces. He attributes this Punishment to Providence. 30\. For it did not seem upon any account to happen by Accident .] The Peripateticks believed, neither Providence , nor Fatal Necessity : And this is the reason why Aristotle is content with saying, that it did not seem that this Statue fell by Accident. He was perswaded that it was pure Chance, but he conforms himself to the common opinion of Mankind, to attribute Effects to their Causes, where there is the least Probability that they are such, especially in matters where Religion is concerned. 'Tis no proper place to prove now the truth of such a general sentiment; but 'tis sufficient to say, that the Tragick Poets chose rather to follow the opinion of the Stoicks , who acknowledged such a Providence, and fatal Necessity, than those of the Peripateticks; very well perceiving, that that was the only means, to preserve, in the Theatre, those wonderful Surprizes which are produc'd by accidents that seem fortuitous, and yet nevertheless have Causes assigned to them, which are certain. 31\. It necessarily follows from hence, that those Fables where this Conduct is observed, will always appear the finest .] This is a necessary consequence; since the Surprize which is caused by Incidents, that are well managed, and produced of one another, must assuredly be more wonderful than that which arises from fortuitous accidents only. Tragedies which cause the great Surprize, will always be the best, this is most certain, and without reply; but a scruple may here be raised, and which seems to me very reasonable; and 'tis this, to know whether Aristotle would have the Poets endeavour to make their Surprizes by Accidents, which have nothing of Chance in them, and which naturally proceed one from another? Or whether he advises them, to try to produce this Surprize by Accidents which may seem to happen designedly, and yet may be imputed to Chance or Fortune? I should declare my self for the latter, for that seems to me much more Marvellous than the other; and 'tis for this reason that Oedipus is the best Subject for Tragedy that ever was; for whatever happened to that unhappy Prince, has this Character, 'tis managed by Fortune; but every body may see, that all the Accidents have their Causes, and fall out according to the design of a particular Providence. I am perswaded that Aristotle would have explained himself better on this Head, if he had not been afraid of infringing his notion of destiny; and 'tis to this we ought to atrribute the obscurity of this place. Division of Fable into Simple and Implex Their Definition. The distance of Incidents which came one after another, or are produced one of another. 1\. Fables are either Simple or Implex, for all those Actions which Fables imitate,  123 have either one, or t'other of these qualities. 2\. I call the Simple , those Actions which being continued and united,  124 end  125 without Remembrance any remembrance or Peripetie. And I call those Implex, 126 which have either a Peripetie, or Remembrance, or both. 3\. Now both of them ought to proceed from the very Constitution of the Subject, in such a manner, that what preceeds them, should produce them either necessarily, or probably; for there is a very great difference,  127 between Incidents which arise one from another, and those which only come one after another. 1\. I call the Simple, those Actions, which being Continued, and United, end without any Remembrance, or Peripetie .] I call a simple Fable, that, in which there is neither Change of Condition, nor Remembrance, and the unravelling of which, is only a single passage of agitation and trouble, or repose and tranquility. Such is the Ajax and Philoctetes of Sophocles , The Medea and Hecuba of Euripides , the Fable of the Iliads , as also that of the Eneids , are in the number of simple Fables. 2\. I call these Implex, which have either a Peripetie, or Remembrance, or both .] If the Peripetie, that is, the change of the State of the Persons, can be without Remembrance, as in Sophocles's Antigone , the Remembrance may also be without the Peripetie. 'Tis true, there are more examples of the former than the latter, in the Oedipus, and Electra of Sophocles , and the Iphigenia Taurica of Euripides , there are Remembrancee, and Peripeties too. 3\. Now both of them ought to proceed from the very constitution of the Subject; In such a manner, that what preceeds them, should produce them, either Necessarily, or Probably .] The Peripetie, and Remembrance, can neither be necessarily or probable, if they are not drawn from the bottom of the Subject: The Oedipus , and Electra of Sophocles , are the most excellent Models in that kind. That great Poet, hath perfectly imitated the Remembrance, which unravels the Odysses ; for 'tis Homer , who has given to the Tragick Poets, the finest examples, both of the Plots, and unravelling them; our Tragick Poets, have discovered few intrigues by the Remembrance , either because they have found few Subjects which have afforded them, or because, such Subjects have appear'd too difficult to manage, they have however wonderful Effects on the Stage, as we may judge, by the double Remembrance of the Electra of Sophocles . Mr. Corneille was convinced of this, when he said, the Remembrance is the greatest Ornament of Tragedies; but it is certain, that it hath its inconveniencies . The inconveniencies are not those which he mentions; for 'tis so far from destroying the Pathetick sentiments, that nothing whatever affords such moving ones. The greatest inconvenience of Remembrances is, that they are very difficult to manage; for if you make the Spirit speak more than the Heart, they Languish, and grow cold. There are many other ways of deviating from them: Mr. Corneille has ventured at a double Remembrance, in his Heraclius , which I believe Aristotle would not have approved of; for besides its being a Riddle from the beginning to the end, nay, and at the very end you are not certain it is perfected. He offends directly against the Rules which Aristotle has laid down. It is necessary that the Remembrance arise from the Subject; but there is no occasion for it to be the Subject: Now in the Heraclius , 'tis the Remembrance only which makes the Subject; we find only a Father who could not distinguish his Son, whom he had a mind to save, from his Enemy , whom he would destroy. In the Electra of Sophocles , and the Iphigenia Taurica of Euripides , the Remembrance is a means, and not an end. 4\. For there is a very great difference, between Incidents which arise one from another, and those which only come one after another .] 'Those Incidents which are only one after another, are, properly speaking, like Numbers which subsist by themselves, independantly, from those which went before, the First neither induces the Second, nor the Second the Third: But those Incidents which arise from one another, are as parts of the same Body, which could no longer subsist, should we take away, or change, one part only; for that would dissolve the Connexion, and break the Continuity. Of Peripetie and Remembrance. There are many sorts of Remembrances. Which is the most perfect; and the Conditions it ought to have. It is single, or double . What Passion is in Fable. 1\. Peripetie is a change of  128 one Fortune into another  129 contrary to what was expected , and that Change happens either Necessarily, or Probably, as in the Oedipus of Sophocles ; for he who comes to tell him agreeable news, and ought to deliver him out of those fears, into which, the thoughts  130 of committing Incest with his Mother had cast him, does the quite contrary, in telling him plainly what the is.  131 Or as in the Lynceus of Theodectes where Lynceus who was led to dye, and Danaus who followed in order to  132 Sacrifice him[illeg.] both changed their Fortune ; for by a Series of Incidents, it hapned that  133 Danaus suffered the Death he had prepared for Lynceus , and  134 Lynceus was Saved. 3\. The Remembrance, as the Name it self testifies, is a Change, which causing us to pass from Ignorance to Knowledge, produces either Hatred or Love, in those  135 whom the Poet has a design to render either happy or miserable. 3\. The best Remembrance, is that which is found with the Peripetie, as in the Oedipus. 4\. There are many other sorts of Remembrances; for it falls out very often, that we  136 Remember inanimate things, and those which are most common.  137 We Remember also, for example , what any Person has done, or what he has not done. But that of which I have spoken is the most proper for Fable and Action; for that Remembrance, accompanied with the Peripetie, will Infallibly produce, either Compassion,  138 or Terror, of which  139 Tragedy  140 is an Imitation, as we have laid down for a fundamental : It will also produce either the Good or Ill Fortune of the Principal Persons. 5\. Since then the Remembrance, is the Remembrance of certain Persons, it must be either single, or double; The single is , when one Person is Remembred by another whom he knows; and the double , when two Persons who know not, do yet come to remember one another, as in the Iphigenia of Euripides , where Orestes Remembred the Princess by  141 means of a Letter; and there must be another Remembrance, that Orestes might be known. 6\. Besides these , two parts of a Fable which regard the Subject,  142 there is a Third, which I call the Passion; I have already explained the Remembrance, and the Peripetie. I call Passion  143 an Action which destroys some Person, or causes some violent Pains, as an evident and certain Death, Torments, Wounds, and all such like things. 1\. Peripetie is a change of one Fortune into another, contrary to what was expected .] I have added these last words, better to explain Aristotle's Thought; for it is certain, that the Peripeties, which are least expected, and most surprizing, are the finest, provided they be either necessary or probable. 2\. As in the Oedipus of Sophocles; for he who comes to tell him agreeable News, and ought to deliver him out of those Fears ,  &c.] 'Tis in the Third Scene of the Fourth Act; A Man from Corinth , comes to acquaint Oedipus of King Polybius's Death, that he might go and take possession of that Kingdom : Oedipus , who thought that Polybius was his Father, and being affraid of committing Incest, as the Oracle had said he should, told him, that he was resolved never to go into any place where his Mother was. The Corinthian answered, that 'twas very plain, he did not know himself, and that he disturbed himself about nothing; and thinking to do him some signal Service, in bringing him out of his Error, he told him, that he was not the Son of Polybius and Merope , which began the Remembrance, which cast him into the most Horrible of all his Misfortunes. Thus did the discourse of this Corinthian produce a Change of Fortune, not probably, but necessarily; for without doubt whatever is necessary, probable; but all that is probable, is not always dispensably necessary. 3\. Or as in the Lynceus of Theodectes.] Theodectes was a Lycian , a Disciple of Plato , and a great friend of Aristotle's ; He wrote Fifty Tragedies, but not so well in Prose as in Verse. Nothing of his remains, and we know not the Subject of his Lynceus , 'tis probable that it was taken from the Story of the Danaids , who, by the command of their Father Danaus , killed all their Husbands on the Wedding Night: Hypermnestra only saved hers, and spared his Life, who was this Lynceus. Danaus set Messengers after him, being resolved to finish what he had began, lest he should revenge the death of his Brethren; he would also have put Hypermnestra to Death, under some false pretence, which tyrants never want: But the People filled with horror, at the Cruelty and Injustice of such a Barbarous Father, and touch'd with Compassion for his Son-in-Law and his Daughter, made an Insurrection, saved the Life of Lynceus , and put Danaus to Death. You may see the Twentieth Chapter. [illeg.]. Gombault has treated the same Subject in his [illeg.]ce of the Danaids , but cannot be sufficiently wonder'd at, for not following the Conduct of the Greek Poet; for instead of making Lynceus and Hypermnestra be led to Execution, and afterwards freed by an Insurrection of the People, who tore Danaus in Pieces; he makes Lynceus return with his own Retinue, and kill Danaus his Father-in-Law in a Duel, and thus the Poet fell unnecessarily into a very Cruel Action; he loses the best Peripetie that could ever be brought on the Stage, and spoils an unravelling which is perfectly fine. He would not have been guilty of this fault, if he had Read the Fifteenth Chapter of this Art of Poetry . This is the difference which the neglect of Rules make in the same Piece; in observing them we follow Nature, which is the supreme Reason, and we always please; in breaking them, just the contrary happens. 4\. The Remembrance, as the Name it self testifies is a Change, which causing us to pass from Ignorance to Knowledge, produces either Hatred or Love, in the whom the Poet has a design to render either Happy or Miserable .] In defining the Remembrance, Aristotle takes care to note the Qualities which it ought to have to be good; it ought not to be in vain, and to leave those who Remember one another, in the same sentiments they were before: It must produce either Hatred, or Love. But this is not sufficient it must also stir up one of these Passions in those whom the Poet has a mind to make Happy or Miserable; that is, of the Principal Persons; for if the Remembrance descends to the subordinate Persons, or the Episodick ones, 'tis vitious, and never produces any good effect. The Remembrance which is between the first and second Persons is blameable, if it be not the Consequence of a former Remembrance which was between the Principal Actors; and such an one in the Electra of Sophocles is the Remembrance of Orestes's Governour, who is not known to the Princess, till after Orestes and he had Remember'd one another. 5\. The best Remembrance, is that which is found with the Peripetie, as in the Oedipus .] Strictly speaking there is no Remembrance which does not produce a Peripetie ; for there is none which doth not make some manner of change in the condition of some of the Persons who are Remember'd; but I believe this is not what Aristotle meant ; he would give us to understand, that the finest Remembrance is that which produces on the spot, that change in the Fortune of the Principal Persons, which is the unravelling of the Intrigue, and the finishing of the Piece; for that Remembrance, which makes the Heroe of the Poem pass at once, from the greatest Felicity, to an Extremity of Misery, or which draws him from the depth of Despair, to place him in possession of extraordinary Happiness; has much greater Effects on the minds of the Audience, than that which does not Surprize it all at once, but disposes all things plainly, and conducts them to their end by other means. The Subject of Oedipus furnished Sophocles with the best Remembrance the Theatre ever saw; for that Prince no sooner knew himself to be the Son of Laius and Jocasta , but of the most Happy of Men, he became at once the most Miserable. The Remembrance of the Electra of the same Poet , is not near so sprightly nor so fine, because it is remote from the Peripetie; for after Orestes and Electra remembred one another, their Fortune continued the same, and they did not change their Condition, till after the Death of Clytemnestra and Egysthes . There is the same Remembrance in the second Iphigenia of Euripides , in his Helena , and in his Electra . All these Examples prove the truth of Aristotle's Judgment; insomuch that we must necessarily agree, that the best Remembrance is that which immediately produces the Peripetie. 'Tis aparent that Mr. Corneille was not sensible of this Truth when he Writ his Heraclius , wherein the Peripetie precedes the Remembrance, for the true Peripetie of that Piece is the Death of Phocas; Martian and Heraclius were known afterwards, but 'twas when they had nothing to fear, and consequently the Audience had no great concern to know, which of the two was Heraclius or Martian. 6\. There are many sorts of Remembrances, for it falls out very often, that we remember in animate things, and those which are common .] After having spoke of the Principal Remembrance, Aristotle thought he could not be excused from speaking a Word of the others which are inferiour to it; but such however, as the best Poets have not disdain'd to make use of; 'tis when we remember the most Ordinary and Common things, as Horses, Neck-laces, & c . In the Coephores of Eschylus, Electra finding Horses at her Father's Tomb, knew them to be Orestes's . The same Chanced to Chrysothemis , in the Electra of Sophocles , we shall speak at large of these Remembrances in the xvii. Chapter. 7\. We remember also, for example, what any Person has done, or what he has not done .] As in the Electra of Sophocles; Electra and Chrysothemis , Remember that the Libations which they found on Agamemnons Tomb, were not of Clytemnestra's puting, but Orestes's or somebody on his account. 8\. But that of which I have spoken, is the most proper for Fable, and Action .] If the other Remembrances are well managed, they ought to be means and preparatives for that which should follow, for they would be very vitious if they were alone; but as their end is to produce another Remembrance, they are never so proper for Fable, and have not so much Action as those which are done at once, and produce the Peripetie without delay. 9\. For that Remembrance accompanied with the Peripetie, will Infallibly produce either Compassion, or Terror, of which Tragedy is an Imitation, &c .] He here gives the reason of what he had before said, ( viz ) That the Remembrance which is Joyned to the Peripetie, is the most proper for Fable, and for Action: And this reason is drawn from his general principle, that Tragedy is the Imitation of an Action; and not only of an Action, but of such an one which excites Pity, and Fear, all this is found in that Remembrance which he prefers to the rest; there is Action, since it makes the Good or Ill Fortune of the principal Personages, and it can't fail of exciting Terror or Compassion, since in one and the same moment, it decides things of so great Importance, and produces such grand Effects. 10\. The Single is, when one Person is Remember'd, by another which he knows .] As in Oedipus ; for that Prince is remember'd by Jocasta whom he knew. 11\. And the Double, when two Persons who know not, do yet come to Remember one another, as in the Iphigenia of Euripides.] 'Tis in the Iphigenia Taurica , where Iphigenia is Remember'd by Orestes , by a Letter which she gave him to carry into Greece , and of which, she had told him the Contents, that if the Letter should chance to be lost, he might deliver what she had writ by word of Mouth. And Orestes is Remembred by Iphigenia , by certain Presents which she made him. In the Electra of Sophocles , the Remembrance is also Double; for Electra is first known by Orestes , and afterwards Orestes by Electra. 12\. Besides these two parts of a Fable which regard the Subject, there is also another which I call the Passion ]. The Passion is still more Essential to the Subject than the Remembrance, and the Peripetie; since there are simple Subjects which have neither Remembrance, nor Peripetie, and yet have Passion, as the Ajax of Sophocles , and the Hecuba of Euripides. 13\. I call the Passion, an Action which destroys some Person .] I know very well that the word Passion is neither French nor English in this sense, except it be in Matters of Religion, and that ev'ry where else it signifies the Sentiments, or to speak more properly, the Weaknesses of the Soul: But this does not explain what Aristotle would say, but I am willing to avoid Equivocations in the explanation of this Sentence. 14\. As are evident and certain Deaths .] The Greek words are remarkable, ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ἴ ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/isubgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/isubgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  Mortes in aperto; Open deaths . Mr. Corneille , in his Examien of Horace , explains it, Deaths in the Shows, or Plays. 'Tis a Rule , says he, not to fill the Stage with Blood; It was not so in Aristotle's time, who tells us, That to move Powerfully and Effectually, we must shew on the Stage the unpleasant sights of Wounds, and Death . But this could not be Aristotle's meaning, who had no design to approve of Murders on the Stage, since it was contrary to the practice of the Ancients. Mr. Corneille did not well understand the Greek term, ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/isubgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/isubgr.gif)  which does not strictly signify a thing exposed to the Eyes; but a thing which is evident and certain, and of which we have such tokens that we cannot doubt of it: He opposes ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ,  , certain ; to ἄ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ,  , doubtful . Under this General expression, the Philosopher comprehends the two sorts of Death which were found in Tragedy, those which were seen, and those which were not seen; for a Person may come and dye on the Stage, though he was not any ways hurt. The Parts of Quantity of Tragedy, and their Definition. 1\. After having explained the Parts which Constitute the Form and Quality of Tragedy, I must speak of those which Constitute the Quantity, and which have a seperate Subsistance. 2\. Tragedy hath four Principal Parts, the Prologue , the Episode , the Exode , and the Chorus , and the last is again divided into Three Parts, which are called Parodos ,  144 Stasimon , and  145 Commoi . The two First are found in all Pieces; but the Third is only in certain Tragedies: It is always mixed with the Action, and is common to the Actors, and the Chorus. 3\. The Prologue , is all that part of the Tragedy which  146 precedes the entrance of the Chorus. 4\. The Episode , is that which is between the  147 Songs of the Chorus. 5\. The Exode , is all that which is said after the Chorus has left of singing, not to begin again. 6\. The Parodos , is the first discourse of all the Chorus. 7\. The Stasimon , is all that which the Chorus sings after it has taken possession of the Stage, and is as it were incorporated in the Action, This Song is without Anap aestes and Trochees. 8\. Commoi , are the Lamentations which the Chorus and the Actors make together  148 . 1\. After having explained the parts which constitute the form and quality of Tragedy .] These Parts are the Subjects, Manners, Sentiments, Musick, Decoration, Remembrance, Peripetie, and Passion. 2\. I must speak of those which Constitute the Quantity, and which have a Separate Subsistance .] The Parts of Quality may be found altogether, thro' the whole Piece, and not taken notice of Separately; on the Contrary, the Parts of Quantity are seperately measur'd, and can never be together; they have their fixt places marked out which they can never change, any more than the Parts of the Body. 3\. Tragedy hath four Principal Parts, The Prologue, the Episodes, the Exode, and the Chorus.] We are come now to one of the most difficult places, of the Art of Poetry , That is the Division which Aristotle makes of the Parts which Compose the Body of Tragedy. I shall endeavour to clear these difficulties, and hope to do it in such a manner, that every one may Wonder at the Boldness of a certain Writer, who in his practice of the Theatre, (a work otherwise filled with good things) makes no Scruple to say, that Aristotle did not distinguish the Parts of the Poem as it was in his time, or at least in the time of those three excellent Tragedians which now remains, whose Works , says he, have no agreement with his Discourse : Surely no Accusation was ever so Rash. He was not quite so Bold, who accused Hercules of being a Coward. We shall see in what follows, that the Writer did not know the Practice of the Greeks , nor the Art of their Plays. But before we begin with that, we will say a Word or two of the Nature of this Division, no Body can doubt, but that 'tis much better than the Latins have made, in saying, that a Tragedy hath five Acts; for this Division which Divides Tragedy into so many equal Parts, denotes well enough its extent, but not the difference of its Parts; whereas that of the Greeks into unequal Parts, shews the extent of Tragedy in general, and the different nature of its parts in particular. Perhaps you may say, that the Latin Division makes four Intervals, or Time of rest in Tragedy, which the Greek does not. To this I answer, that the Greek Division does what it ought to do, that is, to let us know the different Parts which Compose the Body of Tragedy, and which the Latin by no means does; on the contrary, it explains the Matter, as if there were five Actions in the place of one, which is very vitious. And as for the Intervals, 'tis true, Aristotle doth not speak of them in this Work, for that was the Matter of another Precept which he has without doubt explained in some of his Books, which are lost, either in his Treatise of Musick, or in that of Tragedies: for it is not sufficient to tell us only as Horace doth, that a Dramatick Poem ought to have five Acts Neve minor, neu sit quinto productior actu Fabula. Five Acts; no more, nor less, a Play must have. He should have added, the reason of this Division, and show'd why a Piece of the Theatre ought to have four Intervals, or four Songs of the Chorus, rather than five; and certainly, this is what he ought not to have forgot. I am also perswaded that 'tis from this, that Vitruvius has taken what he says of the Intervals of the Greek Pieces: That the Comick Poets divided the Spaces of their Fables into parts, by a Cubical Proportion; Diviserunt Spatia Fabularum, in partes, ratione Cubica . That is to say, that what Aristotle calls here Episode , the Subject of the Piece was included between the four Songs of the Chorus; and that the four Songs, joyned to the Prologue and Exode, made the Number six, which is a Cubick Number, and the most perfect of all Numbers, as some Mathematicians pretend. Vitruvius says, of the Comick Poets, what he ought to have said of all the Poets in general; for the Comick Poets have nothing peculiar, as to what regards the Intervals: As to the Convenience of these Spaces, divided by the Song of the Chorus , 'twas no less than that of the Division into our Acts; for we may Count by the first, second, third, & c . Song of the Chorus , as we Count by the first, second, third, & c . Act; and it had moreover this Advantage, that every Song of the Chorus having some difference, whereby it was distinguish'd from the rest, any one who came in, for example, at the third Song, might presently tell which it was: Whereas when we come in at the second, or third Act, we cannot tell whereabouts they are, unless those who were there from the beginning tell us. 4\. And this last is again divided into three Parts, which are called Parodos, Stasimon, and Commoi.] Aristotle does not speak here only, of what the Chorus Sung between the Acts, and sometimes also in the course of the Acts, when they Lamented with the Actors; but what the Chorus said in the Acts, as an Actor, was not comprehended, in what Aristotle calls here Choricum , Song of the Chorus . We will explain every part one by one. 5\. The Prologue is the part of the Tragedy, which precedes the entrance of the Chorus .] The Prologue is made to explain to the Audience, not only what concerns the Subject of the Poem, but what is proper, and necessary, and makes a true part of it; 'tis our first Act. But you may say, since the Prologue is a part of quantity of the Tragedy, there can be no Tragedy without a Prologue ; The Prologue is all that which precedes the entrance of the Chorus ; now there are Tragedies, where the Chorus enters first on the Stage, and consequently there can be no Prologue to those Pieces; or what Aristotle has said, that the Prologue precedes the entrance of the Chorus , is false. Thus they will talk, who don't understand what they Read, nor give themseves time to examine those things of which they Write. The Author of the Practice of the Theatre, would not have fallen into this Error, if he had known the nature of those Actions which make the Subjects of the Greek Tragedies ; or to speak more properly, might make the Subject of Tragedy; considering the Truth and Simplicity of that Poem, when associated with the Chorus . These Actions then can be but of two sorts, for either they begin before the People concerned are Assembled, and give occasion to that Assembly; or else 'tis the Assembly of the People which begins the Action, and which gives occasion to the Incidents that Compose it. There is no mean between these two sorts of Actions; and which we shall endeavour to render very plain, by Examples. It is no difficult Matter to find enough for the first Case, these Actions which begin before the People are Assembled, are very common; and 'tis thus, that almost all the Actions which make the Subjects of the Greek Pieces, do begin. In the Electra of Sophocles, Orestes accompanied by Pylades , arrived at Mycena , just at Day-break, and concerted with his Governour the proper Methods to succeed in his Enterprize. Electra at the same time left Egysthes Palace, which she could no longer endure, and went to Lament her Misfortunes. These Complaints of hers, gave occasion to the Young Ladies of Mycena to visit that Princess, in order to Comfort her, and at the end of the first Act, those Ladies are the Chorus . Thus what preceded the first Song of the Chorus , is the true Prologue of that Play, according to Aristotles's definition. 'Tis the same with all the other Pieces of that great Poet, they have every one their Prologue , and 'tis directly contrary to the Truth to attest that they have not. We come now to the second sort of Actions, which gave occasion to this Error; but as they are much more rare than the other, we must not wonder if there are very few Tragedies which begin in this manner. There are but two, in Æ schylus, the Persians , and the Suppliants ; and one in Euripides , (viz.) Rhesus . We need only explain the Subject of these Pieces, and 'twill appear, that altho' the Chorus opens the Scene, yet they are not without Prologues , but have them as well as those Pieces, where the Chorus doth not enter, till some of the Actors have spoke, and the Action is began. The Subject of the Persians of Æ schylus , is the defeat of Xerxes , who retired out of Greece , after he had lost the two Famous Battles of Salamine , and Platea . This is the manner in which the Subject is constituted, or rather, the manner in which the Scene opens; for the question is concerning that. As it was a long time, since that Prince sent a Courier to the Queen Atossa his Mother, the chief Lords of Susa , who were some old States-men, to whom the King had committed the Administration of his Kingdom, Assembled together to consult of the present Affairs; whilst they were in Council, the Queen Atossa , who had been Frightned by some Dreams the Night before, comes to them. Thus these old Gentlemen make the Prologue , but they don't begin the Duty of the Chorus , till after the Action is commenced, and the Audience instructed. In the Suppliants of the same Poet , the fifty Daughters of Danaus , to avoid Marrying with their Cousin-Germans, the Sons of Æ gyptus , forsake their Country; and demand Protection of the King of Argos . The Scene opens by the fifty Ladies, who coming before the Town, declare the reason of their flight, and what obliged them to retire to Argos , rather than any where else. These same Gentlewomen make the Chorus , but they don't begin the Duty of the Chorus , till after they have made the Prologue , for otherwise, there would be nothing natural in it. The Rhesus of Euripides sets this Truth in a much better light; the Centinels that watch'd in the Trojan Camp, who then Besieged the Greeks in their Retrenchments, after they had Routed them, come to Hector's Tent, to inform him that the Enemies had lighted great Fires, and that there was a great Noise towards Agamemnon's Quarters; 'tis these Centinels which open the Scene, begin the Action, and are afterwards the Chorus of the Piece. Tho' the Chorus is first on the Stage, there is nevertheless a Prologue ; 'tis the Chorus indeed which makes it, but they are not properly the Chorus till after the Subject is expounded, and the Action commenced. Moreover there are Pieces where the Chorus is the first on the Stage, and yet notwithstanding that, there is a Prologie , tho' it be not made by the Chorus ; A couple of Examples will make this very plain. The Suppliants of Euripides are the chief Ladies of Argos , whose Husbands were killed before Thebes , they come to entreat Theseus to let them have the Bodies that they might bury them, They are at Eleusina , near the Temple of Ceres; Theseus his Mother, who went from Athens to Sacrifice to that Goddess, found these Women there, who immediately cast themselves at her Feet: This is the opening of the Scene. 'Tis the Mother of Theseus who makes the Prologue , and the Suppliants don't form the Chorus , till after that Princess had spake and heard their request. The other Example is as clear, and 'tis taken from the Oedipus of Sophocles , the sinest Tragedy of all Antiquity. Jupiter's High Priest, followed by a great many other Priests, and the chosen young Men of Thebes , is going to prostrate himself at an Altar, which was Erected to Oedipus , before the Court of his Palace; The Cries and Groans both of young and old, obliged that Prince to come out to know the reason of it; and this is what makes the opening of the Scene: Oedipus makes the Prologue , and when the Subject is well explained, the Priests themselves make the Chorus of the Piece. 'Tis certain then, that the Greeks had no Tragedies without that, which Aristotle here calls Prologue , and consequently the Philosopher had reason to make the Prologue one part of the quantity of Tragedy. He who would contradict him, was so little acquainted with the Greek Authors, that he calls the Persians of Æ schylus , the Persian Women ; as if the Chorus of that Piece was composed of Women, whereas it was made up of old Men, as I have already said: As for what remains, we must not confound the Prologue of the Greek Tragedy, with the Prologue of the Latin Comedy. The Prologue of those Comick Pieces did not make a part of the Action for the Stage; 'tis borrowed from the old Greek Comedy, where it is very often found in the middle of the Play, under the name of Parabasis . The Latins almost always place it at the beginning of their Pieces. There are some however that have taken the liberty of the Greeks , and placed the Prologue in the Play, as Plautus has made it the First Act, in his Miles Gloriosus Boasting Soldier ; and put it after the first Act in his Cistellaria : But that was never followed by prudent and regular Poets. Terence took care, not to be guilty of so great a fault. 6\. The Episode is that which is between the Songs of the Chorus.] Tragedy, in its original, was nothing but a Chorus , without Actors; afterwards they added Actors, to give time to the Chorus to rest, and all that which the Actors said between the Songs of the Chorus , was called Episode ; that is as much as to say, an Additional Part ; because those recitations were foreign and super-added Pieces, always included between two Songs of the Chorus , and drawn from different Adventure so; that there were many different Episodes : But when Tragedy began to come into form, and those Recitations which were only accessary parts, became the principal; then they began to look on the Subject of Tragedy, as a Body which ought to have no strange Members, or which were independent of one another; The good Poets drew the Subject of their Recitations from one and the same Action; and that Action retain'd its first name, and was called Episode . This is the Reason why Aristotle says, that the Episode is all that which is included between the Songs of the Chorus ; that is to say, That 'tis all the Subject of Tragedy, or rather all that makes the Intrigues and Plot, till its unravelling, and the Catastrophe, which never happens till after the Fourth and last Song of the Chorus , in those Pieces which are well Composed. 7\. The Exode, is all that which is said after the Chorus has left off Singing, not to begin again .] A very Learned Man thought, that the Exode was properly the Epilogue , and that 'twas used to thank the Company, and take leave of them; but I find no such sort of Epilogues in the Greek Tragedies, which generally end with a Moral Instruction, or Praise, or Prayer, or Wishes, & c . If the Exode were only a returning Thanks, and taking Leave, it would not make a part of the Quantity of Tragedy; it would be a separate part, as a Compliment made by an Actor, on our Stage, at the end of the Play. The manner in which Aristotle explains himself, will not permit us to take the Exode in that sence, since he defines it, All that is after the last Song of the Chorus; that word All denotes, that 'tis a part, which hath extent; and truly the Exode is the Unravelling, and Catastrophe of the Piece. This Unravelling begins always after the last Song of the Chorus , in those Plays which are well made, and answers exactly to our Fifth Act. But you may say, Why was not this Exode, this Fifth Act , included between two Songs of the Chorus , as those two which precede? 'Tis very easie to answer to that Objection; 'tis not natural to sing, neither does any desire to hear Singing at the End of a Tragick Action. The Audience would have had no Concern in that Chorus , nor would have given Attention to the End of it; what the Chorus should say after the Action was finished, could not be too short: It often says but two or three Verses: It never exceeds seven, or eight; but when it is either an Instruction or a Petition. There are some Plays which end without any Discourse of the Chorus ; as the Troades of Euripides , the Prometheus , and Eumenides of Æ schylus. 8\. The Parodos, is the first Discourse of all the Chorus.] I have kept to Aristotle's own Terms, who uses the Word ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , Discourse , for those words which were put into Song; for the Parodos was the first Song of the Chorus after the Prologue . When the Chorus Spake, only one did it for the whole Company; but when it Sung, all they who composed the Chorus sung together: This is the Reason, why Aristotle says here, the first Discourse of the Chorus; but to render what he hath said more plain, I shall apply it to the Oedipus of Sophocles , which, I have translated, and am resolved to publish, after this Art of Poetry . The Prologue comprehends the two first Scenes which begins ![](/images/inline/OHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , Divine Oracle of Jupiter ,  &c. is the Parodos , the first Song of the Chorus . The Episode comprehends the Second, Third, and Fourth Acts, 'till the Chorus , which begins, ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Zgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) Unhappy Mortals, whose extreamest Bliss, To nothing justly I compare. And the Exode is all the Fifth Act. 'Tis necessary to know, that the first Song on the Chorus , always ends the first Act, makes the first Interval; and consequently in all those Plays, where the Chorus speaks, in the Course of the first Act, what it says cannot be the Parodos : 'Tis only one Person of the Chorus , who speaks for all the Company. In the Electra of Sophocles the Chorus enters at the hundred and twentieth Verse and says, ![](/images/inline/sbOHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/OHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) Princess of an unnatural Mother Born.

If I in my Predictions do not fail. Where the Interval of the first Act begins. This is still more Evident, in the Oedipus Colone of the same Poet, where the first Act is of a prodigious length, for 'tis seven Hundred Verses; however the Chorus enters at the Hundred and Eighteenth Verse, and in searching for Oedipus , says, ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/qugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  .

Stranger, you now into this Land art come. And makes the Interval of the first Act. Every time then that the Chorus speaks in the Course of the first Act, whether it speaks alone, or discourses with any of the Actors, we must not think that 'tis the Parodos , the first Song of the Chorus. The Parodos is always at the end of the first Act, and the Chorus never sings before. Twou'd be very unnatural for the Chorus to enter singing. It must have time to learn, and to be instructed in the Action, with which it is to be concerned; and from which it ought to be formed. This is a Rule which the Greeks , who followed Nature very close, never failed to observe, and 'tis only for want of having sufficiently examined their Practice, that the first Discourse of the Chorus has often been taken for the first Song, the Parodos . 'Tis a Fault that some of the Ancients have been guilty of. The Greek Author, who made the Argument to the Persians of Æschylus , quotes for the Parodos of the Phenicians of Euripides , the first Verses of the Chorus. ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) Quitting the Tyrian Shore.

I have been a little long on this Matter, because the understanding of it, is the only Means to read the Greek Poets with Pleasure. 9\. The Stasimon is all that which the Chorus sings, after it has taken Possession of the Stage, and is, as it were, incorporated into the Action.] Aristotle says only, that the Stasimon is without Anapstetig;stes , and Trochees : But I have enlarged his Definition, to render the Matter the more intellegible; the Chorus of the Greek Plays did not properly begin to take Possession of the Stage, and to be incorporated into the Action, 'till the Parodos the first Song: All which was sung after that, was called Stasimon , that is to say, the Three last Songs were comprised under that Name; and they were called so, because the Chorus was fixed, and employed in their Songs, slow Measures, never quick, and precipitate, as the Anap aeste , and the Trochee , which are good only for Motion. 10\. This Song is without Anap aestes and Trochees.] Those two Feet (of which, the Anap aest doth consist of two short, and one long; and the Trochee of one long, and one short) were in the first Song of the Chorus ; but they are very rarely found in the Three others: When the Chorus had not so quick a Movement, this Difference of Numbers, and Measures serves at least, to shew us, with how great Exactness the Greeks composed their Pieces, since they were so nice as to weigh (if I may use that Term) even the very Words of the Chorus , to give them weight, or Levity, according to the Movements the Chorus ought to have. 11\. Commoi are those Lamentations, which the Chorus, and the Actors make together .] The Chorus accompanied the Actors in their Complaints and Lamentations, which they made in the Course of the Acts, on any dismal Accident which happened: And Aristotle did not think it amiss, to give us the Name of those Lamentations: The Name is taken from the Gestures, which are commonlly used on such Occasions, as to strike and beat ones self; and as that falls out, only in those Plays where those fatal Accidents are found, the Philosopher took care to inform us before, that they are found only in certain Tragedies, for they never are in those whose places they were used in, and according to the Subject is not very Tragical. The Characters which Tragedy ought to chuse to be perfect, whether it ought to be simple, or double, and to have a Catastrophe Happy or Fatal. The different Relish of the first Athenians, and those of Aristotle's Time. From what Families the Subjects of the best Pieces were taken . Euripides is defended against the Ancients, who accuse him of being too Tragecal. The Success of his Pieces. The Publick Disputes of the Poets. To be good, a Tragedy ought to have the Approbation, both of the Learned, and the Ignorant . Euripides his Faults. Double Tragedies more Comical than Tragecal. Their Origine. 1\. After having sufficiently explained all the Parts of Tragedy, Order requires that we should treat of those things, which a Poet ought to follow, or avoid, in the Composition of a Subject; and the way which he ought to take, to arrive at the end which Tragedy proposes. 2\. Since Tragedy ought to be Implex and not Simple, to have all the Beauty which it is capable of, and  149 that it ought to excite Terror and Compassion; for we have already said, that that is the Property of this sort of Imitation; 'tis  150 a necessary Consequence, that we must not chuse to make a very honest Man fall from Prosperity into Adversity; for  151 instead of exciting Terror and Compassion, it will give Horror, which is detested by all. 3\. It is also evident, that he must not take an ill Man, to make him pass from an unhappy State, to one that shall be Happy and Easie : There is nothing which is less Tragecal;  152 and we don't find in it any of the Effects of Tragedy; for beside, its not Exciting either Terror or Compassion, it does not give any Pleasure. 4\. Moreover, he ought not to represent the Misfortunes of a very wicked Man: 153 'Tis most certain, that such a Representation may give some Pleasure, but it will produce neither Fear nor Pity; for the first is produced by the Misfortunes of those who are like our selves; and the latter from the Miseries of those who deserve better Luck; and consequently 154 such a Subject hath nothing which either deserves Pity, or is Terrible. 5\. There remains only him then, who is between these who bring  155 neither bad nor good, in the superlative Degree, doth not draw his Misfortunes on him, by his Wickedness, or by his Crimes: He must chuse, from among those who are of Eminent Quality, and of Great Reputation, some Illustrious Person, who is become miserable, by some involuntary Fault, as Oedipus , and Thyestes , and  156 all the Famous Men of those Two Families. 6\. It necessarily follows from hence, that a Fable which is  157 well composed, ought to be simple, and not double, as some People have pretended; and that it ought rather to end with the ill than the good Fortune of the Principal Persons , provided that that Unhappiness be the Consequence of some great Fault, and not the Effect of a Remarkable Crime. In a Word, it ought to be the Misfortune of  158 a Man, who is neither bad nor good; but if he cannot find one, who is exactly such, he ought to chuse one, who is rather good than wicked. 7\. What we see at this Day, is an evident Proof of this Truth. The Poets do now bring all sorts of Subjects on the Stage, with Success ; but those which are at present the best Pieces, and which succeed best, are without doubt those whose Subjects are taken only from a small Number of Families, or those of Alem aeon, Oedipus, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus , and all others, who have either done, or suffer'd terrible things. You may be assured then, that the finest Tragedy, according to the Rules of Art, is that where this Conduct is observed. 8\. 'Tis for this Reason, that those who blame Euripides for following these Maxims, in his Tragedies; and that most of his Pieces have a lamentable Catastrophe , are  159 very much deceived. On the contrary, 'tis perfectly good; and  160 an inconstestable Proof of it is, that in all the publick  161 Disputes, and on the Stage, these sort of Tragedies appear always more Tragecal and affecting,  162 if nothing that is Foreign, disturb or spoil the Representation. And Euripides himself appear'd the most Tragecal of all the Poets, tho' otherwise he was not exact, and correct, in the Conduct and Disposition of his Subjects. 9\. The Fable to which I give the second Place, tho' others have given it the first, is that which hath a double Constitution, as that of the Odysses , and which end with a  163 double Catastrophe ; that is, by one Catastrophe , which is happy for the Good, and fatal for the Wicked. Those who have prefer'd this, to the First, did it in all probability,  164 by reason of the weakness of the Audience, to whose Relish and Desires, the Poets do generally Conform themselves. But the Pleasure which this Fable gives, is nothing near so proper for Tragedy, as for Comedy; and truly  165 we see in Comedy , Enemies as irreconcilable as Orestes , and Egysthus , become, at last, very good Friends, and go off the Stage without  166 one drop of Blood being spilt on either side. 1\. 'Tis a necessary Consequence, that we must not chuse to make a very honest Man fall from Prosperity into Adversity .] None but Aristotle , who was so great a Philosopher, that he knew, perfectly well, the Nature of the Passions, even to the least Difference, could ever pretend, from the Practice of the Ancients, to form Rules so sure, and so judicious, as those he gives us here; but we must confess, in the mean time, that 'twas to the Grecians alone that he proposed such perfect Rules; for as they were the most nice and delicate People of the whole World, they sought, in Tragedy, only the Pleasures which that Poem ought to give. We are not so difficult to be pleased, if a Tragedy has a great deal of Intrigue, Pathetick Sentiments, and Motions, it stirs up our Curiosity, and we desire no more; 'tis equal to us whether a good or wicked Man perish. Let us examine the Rules of Aristotle , with the Reasons which make them so solid; and after that, we shall see whether there be any Opportunity which will permit us to deviate from them. This is Aristotle's way of Reasoning. Tragedy is the Imitation of an Action, which ought to excite Terror and Compassion; the Misfortunes of a very vicious Man, do neither one nor t'other; so they can't make the Subject of Tragedy. If the second Proposition is true, the Consequence is so beyond Contradiction. To be convinc'd of the truth of this Second Proposition, we need only remember that Fear, and Pity, which ought to bear the sway in Tragedy, are two Passions which do ordinarily arise from the Misfortunes of those who are like our selves: And truly, Pity is a Sense of Pain, which the Sufferings of a Man who does not deserve it, produces in us; since that Evil is of such a Nature, that it may happen to us, and which we may reasonably fear; for Self-love is the Foundation of all the Passions; and that Pity, which seems only to exert it self on our Neighbours Account, is really founded on our own. The Misfortunes of a Man, who is Superiour to others by his Virtue, cannot naturally excite in us, either Fear or Pity, because they give us Horror. Now there is a great deal of Difference between a thing that is Horrible, and another that is Pitiful, since that which is Horrible, not only drives away Pity, but often-times casts us into a Passion, which is quite contrary. If these Misfortunes, cannot excite Pity and Fear, they cannot refine the Passions; for the Audience, seeing Virtue unhappy, is thrown into dispair; finds fault, and does not endeavour to resist the Passions, thinking it is in vain to overcome them, since Virtue precipitates us into Misery, no less than Vice does. Aristotle surely had Reason then to exclude a very virtuous Man from Tragedy. Mr. Corneille perceiving that this Maxime would banish the Martyrs from the Stage, endeavoured to find Authorities to defend his Polyeuctes , by other means than its great Success; and at last he found out one Minturnus , who examins in his Treatise, If the Passion of Jesus Christ , and the Holy Martyrs , ought to be excluded the Theatre , by reason of their Virtue? And decides it in his Favour. Thus is Minturnus opposed to Aristotle . If the Polyeuctes of that great Man had no other Foundation, I shou'd think it had but little to rely on. It is better freely to confess, that Mr. Corneille knew the Age he lived in; and that he ventur'd that Poem on that Knowledge which he had. The Success justified the Poet well enough; but I don't know whether it would be easie to justifie that Success: I don't speak here of the Subject, of which few are capable of judging; for perhaps in other respects, that Piece is the best composed of all Mr. Corneille's Plays. It is full of fine Thoughts, and hath perfectly good Characters where the Manners are admirably well denoted: There's no Body but would Interest themselves for Paulinus and Severus , and be concerned at their Inlicity 'Tis this which made the Play succeed; but that Subject is by no means proper for the Stage, which ought neither to expose the good or ill Fortune of a very virtuous Man. In whatever manner we regard Martyrdom, either as a good, or an evil, it cannot excite either Pity or Fear; and consequently can't refine the Passions, which is the only end that Tragedy aims at, as we have already shewn. This Rule of Aristotle will try several other Pieces which have pleased, tho' not by the Subject, but some other Places, which being conformable to these Rules, have all the Beauty they are possibly capable of. The Italian Commentator exalts himself here into mighty Theological speculations, to contradict the Philosopher; as if Divinity, and the Holy Scripture, could ever be contrary to the Sentiments of Nature, on which Aristotle founds his Judgement. 2\. It is also evident, that he must not take an ill Man, to make him pass from an unhappy, to an happy State; there is nothing which is less Tragecal .] If the Misfortunes of a virtuous Man give Horror, the good Fortune of an ill Man will give us Indignation; 'tis for this Reason that he ought also to be excluded the Theatre . There is nothing more certain than this Decision. 3\. And we don't find in it any of the Effects of Tragedy .] These Effects are those which he explains afterwards; the Terror, Compassion, and Pleasure, which ought to be the Products of Tragedy: If Tragedy does not produce these Effects which it ought to produce, it is most certain that it can never obtain its end, and purge the Passions. There is nothing more opposite to the Refining of the Passions, than the Prosperity of the Wicked; instead of correcting, it nourishes and strengthens them; for who would take the Trouble to get rid of his Vices, if they make him happy. 4\. For beside its not exciting either Terror , or Compassion, it does not give any Pleasure .] I could name many Pieces which excite neither Terror, nor Compassion, and yet don't fail of giving Pleasure, and being well received; and don't at all shock the Choice, or the Inclination of the Audience; for he that exposes the happiness of an Ill Man, stirs up Anger, is very far from causing any Pleasure, and consequently can have nothing to render it tollerable. 5\. Moreover, he ought not to represent the misfortunes of a very Wicked Man, 'Tis most certain, that such a representation may give some Pleasure, but it will produce neither Fear nor Pity .] One may have some Pleasure in seeing a very wicked Man punished for his Crimes; but his Misery will never stir us up to Compassion, because he has only what he deserved: For no good Man is ever concerned to see a Murderer, or a Parricide, punished; because it is a just Action, and consequently all good Men ought to be pleased at it. If his Misery does not excite Pity, it will much less excite Fear, and so cannot refine the Passions; for the Spectators knowing themselves not to be so wicked as that Man, will never fear those evils, which he has drawn on him by his Crimes; nor endeavour to make themselves better. 6\. For the first is produced by the misfortunes of those who are like our selves . The misfortunes of those who are above us, don't make us afraid, because they signify little to us, and we are not in a condition to fear them; but it may be objected, that if only the misfortunes of those who are like us[illeg.] Excite fear, Tragedy would not do it, since it exposes only the misfortunes of Princes and Kings and other Illustrious Persons; or if it did give it, it would be to Persons of that Quality, which is the reason why Paul Beny applies the effect of Trajedy to them only. 'Tis no difficult matter to answer this Objection. Mr. Corneille hath endeavour'd to do it, in saying that Paul Beny understood the Words like our Selves , in too literal a Sense, and did not consider that there were no Kings at Athens , where these Poems were Acted from which Aristotle draws his Examples, and forms his Rules. The Philosopher , says he, had no such thought, and would not have employ'd in the Definition of Tragedy, a thing whose effect could so seldom happen, and whose use was restrain'd to so very few Persons. 'Tis true, that Kings are brought on the Stage as the Principal Actors in Tragedy; but the Auditors have no occasion for Scepters to resemble them, in order to fear the misfortunes which befal them, for those Kings are Men as well as the Audience, and fall into misfortune by the Extravagance of those Passions, which the Audience is capable of. They afford an Argument very easy to be made by the greatest and the meanest of Men, and the Spectator can easily judge that a King, who has given himself over to Ambition, Fear, Hatred, Revenge, and falls into great Misfortunes, deserves pity; much more he, who is but an ordinary Man, should curb those Passions for fear they should plunge him into the same misery . But this Answer of Mr. Corneille , instead of solving the difficulty, proves rather that Aristotle's definition is false, for truly, if all the misfortunes which the Passions draw on us should cause fear to every one indifferently, those of Kings and Princes would give it to the People, as well as those of other Men, and consequently Aristotle was in the wrong to say, both in his Rhetorick and here that fear is produc'd by the miseries of those who are like our selves. The true Answer ought to be drawn from Aristotle's own Doctrine, who hath shew'd the Tragedy at first sight, is an Universal Fable which regards all Men in General; 'tis not Oedipus, Atreus , nor Thyestes , but an ordinary Man, to whom they give what Name they please; but the Poet gives him some eminent Name which is known to render the Action the more noble and credible, notwithstanding the Fable be render'd particular by the Names; however, its Nature remains still the same, and 'twill be always general, 'tis a common Man that Acts under the Name of a Prince, or King. Thus Aristotle had reason to call Kings and Princes like our Selves ; for the aim of the Poet is, not to imitate the Actions of Kings, but of mankind, 'tis that which he Represents. \--- Mutato nomine de te Fabula Narratur. Change but the Name, the Story's told of thee. 7\. And the latter from the Miseries of those who deserve better luck .] What Aristotle says here, that Pity is produc'd by the Miseries of those who don't deserve the evils they suffer, seems to contradict what he had said before, that the unhappiness of a very virtuous Man doth not exile Compassion, but notwithstanding this, he does not contradict himself, Pity always presuposes, that those who are pitied are good People, for none would pity them if they thought they deserv'd the Evils they suffer; but they are those who have an ordinary and common Honesty, as all those who are called Honest Men; if they were vertuous and just, to the supreme degree, we should be afflicted with horror only for their misery; for Pity, as well as Fear, requires some sort of equality in those who suffer, and those who are concern'd for their Afflictions. 8\. There remains only him then, who is between these two, who being neither Bad nor Good, in the superlative degree, doth not draw his misfortune on him, by his wickedness, or by his Crime .] It seems that there are yet two conditions of Life which Aristotle has not mention'd, the first is, of those Men who are extra-ordinarily virtuous, who may pass from a very unhappy to a very blessed condition; the other of those Ill Men who should be overwhelm'd with Misery; but Aristotle spake not of them, since one of them has nothing Tragical, and the other nothing that deserves Pity, and which ought not to be admitted. unless in the subordinate Persons; and 'tis thus, the Ancients have used it, at least, in those pieces which now remain, except those simple ones where there is neither Peripitie nor Remembrance; in all the rest, that is in the Implex, those wicked Persons, who are introduc'd on the Stage as Clytemnestra. Egysthes , are never the Principal Persons, and 'tis of these that Aristotle speaks here, and since they can neither be very Vertuous nor very Vitious, they must certainly be between both; now this mean is only in those who commit Errors by their Infirmities and fall into involuntary Crimes. They are vitious, because they do that which is so, and they are good because they commit iniquities, contrary to their Inclinations, and by infirmity. 9\. He must chuse from among those who are of Eminent Quality, great Reputation and some Illustrious Person .] There happen enow extraordinary Adventures, and Tragical enough too, among People of a mean or low Condition. which might deservedly take place in Tragedy; but I believe it would never succed, not by reason of the Action for that would have all necessary and requisite Qualifications, but on account of the meanness of the Persons; for Tragedy, as Epick Poem does not require, that the Action which it represents should be great, and important in it self. It is sufficient that it be Tragical, the Names of the Persons are sufficient to render it Magnificent, which, for that very reason, are all taken from those of the greatest Fortune and Reputation. The greatness of these eminent Men render the Action great, and their Reputation makes it credible and probable. This is the reason why Aristotle said, in the 5th . Chapt. that Epopoeia has this in common with Tragedy, that they are an imitation of the Actions of the greatest Persons, see what was said in the Remarks on that place. 10\. Who is become miserable by some Involuntary fault .] These Words ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif)  don't signify barely, by an humane frailty or fault , but by an involuntary fault, which has been committed either by Ignorance, or Imprudence, against the natural Temper of the Man, when he was transported by a violent Passion, which he could not suppress, or by some greater and external force, in execution of such Orders, as he neither could, nor ought to disobey. Oedipus his fault is of the first sort, and he is also guilty of the second. That of Thyestes is of the second only. Those of Orestes and Alcmeon are of the third, as shall be shown in what follows. 11\. As Oedipus .] Lets hear what Mr. Corneille says, for all, that such great Men as he write, tho' they are deceiv'd, has yet something that is precious. Truly , says he, I don't understand what Aristotle means in this place ; Oedipus doth not seem to me to be guilty of any fault, altho' he kill'd his Father, because he did not know him, and no Man of Spirit and Courage but will dispute the way against a Stranger, who Attacks him very furiously; nevertheless, as the signification of the Greek word ![](/images/inline/rbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , may be extended to mean a simple Error of forgetfulness, such as his was, we will (with the Philosopher) admit of it, altho' I don't well see, what Passion it can refine in us, and which of them it would have us correct by his Example . It seems 'tis of his good grace that he gives us this decision, and on account of the esteem which he had for the Philosopher in other respects. Notwithstanding which Aristotle is in the right, and Mr. Corneille is guilty of two very considerable Faults: The first is, that he did not rightly understand the Words, ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif)  , and consequently must be ignorant of the Nature of Oedipus's Crime. The second is, that he knew very little of the Character of that Patricide Prince, which hinder'd him from seeing what Passions his example instructs us to Correct. The Greek Term has been sufficiently explained in the preceeding Remark. Oedipus his Fault was, being transported to Anger by the Insolence of a Coach-man, who would make him break way against his Will, he killed some Men; two days after the Oracle told him he should kill his own Father. He himself relates the Action in Sophocles very naturally. This Action alone sufficiently denotes his Character, but Sophocles has given one, by all his Manners so Conformable to this; and which answers so perfectly to Aristotle's Rules, that he appears in every respect a Man, who is neither Good nor Bad, a mixture of Virtue and Vice; his Vices are Pride, Violence, Anger, Temerity and Imprudence; 'tis not properly his Patricide nor Incest, which made him unhappy. Any punishment for those had been in a manner unjust since they were Crimes Involuntary and Committed without his Knowledge; he fell not into those terrible Calamities, but by his Curiosity, Rashness and Violence. Thus Creon tells him in the Greek Tragedy, Such Tempers as yours are insupportable to themselves . These are the Vices which Sophocles would have us correct. 'Tis therefore from his piece that we must take the true Characters of Oedipus , to find that just mean which Aristotle here requires. Instead of which Mr. Corneille makes a very Virtuous Man, notwithstanding all his Innocence, fall into horrible Miseries. He himself says, I still remember Generous Exploits , Yet Parricide and Incest do me Haunt , I've follow'd none, but great Alcides Steps. Sought ev'ry where just Laws for to maintain , Ill Men to Punish, and all Vice restrain. We don't find here, that just mean; the Man, who is neither Good nor Bad, and thereby Mr. Corneille his spoiled the most perfect and compleat Character, which the Ancients ever Invented. The exploits of Oedipus alone, were killing four Men in a violent Rage; explaining the Sphinx's Enigma , which the most Wicked Man who had any parts, might have done as well as he; whereupon Sophocles does not praise in him any thing but his Courage, his good Fortune and Judgment, Qualities which are equally common to the Good and the Bad; and in those also, who are made up both of Virtues and Vices, and are neither Righteous nor Wicked. Plutarch was only capable of knowing the true Character of Oedipus ; and that Passion, which by his Example we ought to correct for in his Treatise of Curiosity , he attributes not only the least, but also the greatest misfortunes of this Prince to that Vice. I cite the whole Passage because, 'tis very remarkable, Curiosity cast Oedipus into the greatest of all Evils, for being desirous to know who he was, because they reproached him for being a Stranger. He set forward to Confute the Oracle, met with his Father, and killed him without knowing who he was: afterwards he Married his own Mother, and by that became King of Thebes[illeg.] and when he seemed to be most happy, he had still a desire to know more concerning himself, altho' his Wife used all possible Endeavours to hinder him; but the more she strove to do it, the more he sollicited a certain old Man, who knew all the Affair, threatning and forcing him by all the ways imaginable; so that at last the Business was so far Revealed, that he began to have some sort of Suspicion; and then the Old Man, seeing himself obliged to declare ev'ry particular, Cried out, Alas! I am at last reduced to the Cruel necessity of Speaking . Oedipus transported with Passion and Trembling, answered, and I am reduced to the Cruel necessity to Hear but speak. So much so tickling is the Pleasure of Curiosity, and difficult to withstand as an Ulcer, the more 'tis scratch'd the more 'tis Inflamed and Bloody; but he that is free from this Malady, and of an easy Temper, when he hath neglected to hear some bad News, ought to say. O divine forgetfulness of past Evils, how full of Wisdom art thou ! 12\. Thyestes .] For Thyestes , as Mr. Corneille goes on, I cannot discover that Common Honesty, nor that Crime without a Fault, which plunged him into his Misery; for he is an Incestrious Person, who abuses his Brother's Wife . This Censure appears at first sight better grounded than the first, and it seems not to be so easy to prove the Thyestes's Action was an Involuntary one, such as Aristotle desires in this place, and that he Committed a Sin by the Violence of his Passion only, which would in some measure render his Fault excusable. If Thyestes's Crime was only the Love which he had for his Sister in-Law, it would not be perhaps so difficult to excuse, and 'tis that way some have endeavour'd to do it; but Love was not the only Crime Thyestes was Guilty of; for he not only defiled Atreus's Wife. but carried away the Ram which was the Token of the Empire, and which had the Golden Fleece. Can this premeditated Theft ever pass for a Crime without a Fault? We will give the History, and then judge of it. Atreus and Thyestes , both Sons of Pelops , agreed after the Death of their Father, that they would both Reign by turns at Argos. Atreus , who had been used to Govern, would not give place to Thyestes when it came to his turn. Thyestes being very Angry at this, got Atreus's Wife, carried her away; and that he might have the Empire, which was his due, he carried away the fatal Ram also. 'Twas Thyestes's Anger which provok'd him to take this Revenge on his Brother. Thus is Aristotle justified and the Character of Thyestes Conformable to his Rule; he does amiss, but 'tis by his Anger, and to repel the Injury and Injustice which was done him, and 'tis this without doubt Horace had respect to, where he says in the XVIth Ode of the 1st Book. Ir ae Thyestem exitio gravi stravere. Anger , Thyestes, Overwhelm'd with Woe. As Mr. Corneille has accused Aristotle of not knowing Thyestes's Character. I accuse Horace of having put Thyestes for Atreus ; but Aristotle and Horace are in the right, and Mr. Corneille and I in the wrong. For I may venture to put my self into Competition with that Great Man, where we speak only of faults which we are both Guilty of. As for the Refining the Passions, 'tis no difficult matter to shew immediately, what Vices this example of Thyestes may correct in us; 'tis Choler, and an inordinate and unbridled desire of Revenge, which always draws a Man to act Unjustly and sooner or later is fatal. This Anger of Thyestes was the occasion of all the miseries of the Pelopides . The only thing which can be opposed to my Remark, is what Aristotle says in the 3d Book of his Morals when he treats of Actions which are Voluntary, and of those which are Involuntary, or by Compulsion; plainly determines that all the Actions which are Committed by Anger or Lust, ought to pass for Voluntary, and no ways forced, because their Principles are in us, and we do them willingly, and with the knowledge of all their circumstances. This is certainly true, when we consider Actions one by one, and to the bottom; but when we consider them in general, and in themselves, we may say of those which Anger has produced, that they are involuntary and forced, because without violent Passion there would be no such things, and they would never be Committed. Otherwise it is certain, as Aristotle assures us, that ev'ry forced or involuntary Action is accompanied with sadness, for sadness is an inseparable condition of an involuntary Action. We can no longer doubt but that Cholerick Actions are forced Actions, since in them we find the Character of Sadness and Grief. And this is a truth which Theophrastus perceived very well; for the Emperor Marcus Aurelius tell us in the 2d Book of his Reflections, that in the comparison which that Philosopher had made of Sins in their general respects had asserted, That those which proceed from Concupiscence, are greater, and deserve more punishment than those which proceed from Anger, because what that Passion makes a Man act, seems to resist Reason, be against his Will, and with a sort of secret Reluctance, and he is very like a Man that has received some affront, whose uneasiness obliges him to revenge himself, whereas the Voluptuous goes on to Injustice by his own proper Motion, and to gratify his Passion . But it may be said, that tho' the matter disputed of is preserv'd, yet that does not excuse Aristotle from contradicting himself, since he says in his Art of Poetry, that the Crime Thyestes was guilty of was an involuntary fault; and in his Morals he says that it was an Action purely free, and which lay in his own power to do, or not to do. I answer, that there is no contradiction in Aristotle , for in his Morals he examines the actions of Men, and their Passions throughly, and one by one, according to the Principles of Morality; and that in his Art of Poetry he examines them only in gross, and with respect to Poetry. Which is satisfied with general inspections, whereas Morality requires particular ones, and searches the very Origine and Principle of all our Actions. 13\. It necessarily follows from hence, that a Fable which is well composed, ought to be Simple and not Double.] Aristotle in this place calls that a Simple Fable , which exposes the unhappiness of one Man only. He calls it double, when it has a double Catastrophe, that is, when it finishes by one Catastrophe which is happy for the Good, and another which is unhappy for the Impious, as in the Electra of Sophocles , where Electra and Orestes are at last made happy, and Egisthus and Clytemstra perish. But from what this Philosopher says, doth it necessarily follow, that an excellent Tragedy ought to be single and not double? Yes, without doubt, for since he has said, that to be perfect, a Tragedy, ought to take the Action of one Man who being neither good nor ill, is not render'd unhappy by his own fault; this can be found only in simple Fables; the consequence therefore is necessary sure and indisputable. The Fable which has the double Catastrophe of which I have spoken, is directly opposite to this Rule, the prosperity of the good hath nothing Tragical in it; and there is nothing terrible, nor that deserves pity in the punishment of the Wicked. We shall see in this Chapter, what 'twas Introduced the double Fables; the reason why they succeed, and will continue so to do. 14\. As some People have pretended .] He does not name those who contradicted this opinion, but without doubt they were such, whose Authority had some force. Socrates and Plato were probably of the number, for both of them asserted, that Tragedy ought to be regulated according to Law, and that it should be Conform to the meaning of the Law. Now the Law wills, that the Good prosper, and the Wicked be destroyed. This is a very remarkable passage on this Head in Plato, de Leg. lib. 7. 15\. If he cannot find one who is exactly such, he ought to chuse one, who is rather good than Wicked .] There is but one Sovereign Perfection, all that is below it is more or less perfect, as it approaches more or less that first Pattern; from whence it follows as a sure Consequence, if the Poet cannot find a Man who is in the just mean, whose good and evil Qualities are so exactly mingled, that he is neither good nor bad, to form the subject of a Tragedy off, he ought to chuse one, who is as near that just mean as possibly he can; but if he be rather Wicked than Pious, he can neither excite Fear nor Pity, for those reasons which have been already laid down; he must be rather Pious, than Wicked as the Promotheus and Agamemnon of Æ schylus , the Ajax and Antigone of Sophocles , the Hippolitus , and some other Heroes of Euripides , we have at this time some single pieces in our Theatre, but if I well remember there is none which is exact according to either of these Rules, except Mr. Racine's Ph aedra , which is a Greek Play. That is, there is none whose Hero being neither Good nor Wicked, falls into misfortunes by his own fault, or being rather good, than Wicked draws a fatal Catastrophe on himself by an involuntary Crime. So that our Theatre cannot pretend to say, it has the two sorts of Tragedy, to which Aristotle gives the chief places. 16\. What we see at this day, is an evident Proof of this Truth; the Poets do now bring all sorts of Subjects on the Stage with success; but these which are at present the best pieces, and which succeed best, are those, of which the Subjects are taken only from a small number of Families .] This is one of the most important Passages of the whole Book; the Commentators think that Aristotle means that the Antient Poets introduc'd all sorts of Subjects on the Stage, and that those, of his time being more judicious and wiser, had only choice Subjects, and conformable to the Rules he had given; but this is not Aristotle's meaning, who never had any thoughts of preferring the Poets of his own time to Sophocles and Euripides , whom he always looks on as the Master of, and Patterns for the Stage. His design is to confirm, by Authority and Examples, an Opinion which he has already prov'd, by very solid reasons, he does not take this Authority and Examples from the change the Poets of his time had made in Tragedy; but from the change which was made in the Audience. Formerly, says he, the Poets brought all sorts of Subjects on the Stage, and the People who were not very nice, saw them all with pleasure; but now their Relish is more delicate, and the Audience Criticizing, none succeed, but those Plays, which are made according to the Rules I have laid down: and 'tis an undeniable sign of it, that those Tragedies are the most perfect and fine, which imitate the Action of a Man, who is neither good nor bad, or less wicked than good. It is certain that Æ schylus, Sophocles and Euripides brought all sorts of Subjects on the Stage indifferently, we have the Persians , and Suppliants of Æ schylus , which are not according to the Idea Aristotle gives us here: We have the Philoctetes of Sophocles ; the Alcestes, Suppliants, Rhesuss Bacchantes, Heraclides, Helena and Ion of Euripides ; without counting the other pieces of these three Poets, which are lost, and of which the Names only remain, these sufficiently denote that most of them were far enough off from that Perfection which Aristotle sought after. This Passage teaches us something which is particularly remarkable, that those very Tragedies which did succeed in their time had not the same success afterwards, and that those only were esteem'd, which were according to Aristotle's Rules; whatever good Opinion we may have of our selves at this day, were have the same vitiated Relish the old Athenians had, and for which Aristotle Condemns them; we Entertain, as they did, all sorts of Subjects in our Theatre, the misfortunes of an honest Man, and those of the wicked, Tragical and Romantick Adventures, nay, we have Tragedies, whose Constitution is so Comical, that we need only change the Names, to make a true Comedy of them, but the difference between the old Athenians and us, and which is on their side, is, that Tragedy was hardly finish'd in their time, whereas, 'tis now two Thousand Years since it has had all the Perfection can possibly be given to it. 17\. As those of Alcmeon, Oedipus, Thyestes, Meleager, Telephus,  &c.] We have had the Stories of Oedipus, Orestes and Thyestes , there remain only Alcmeon, Meleager and Telephus , to give an Account of. Alcmeon was the Son of Amphiaraus and Eriphyla . His Father, who was a great Southsayer, foreseeing that all who went with Adrastus to the Theban War should perish, Adrastus only excepted, refused to go along with him, and prevented several others from entring into the same League. Adrastus , and his Son-in- law Polynices , or as others call him Eterocles , went to Consult Iphis , to know how they might bring Amphiaraus to a Compliance. Iphis told them, that they need only give the Necklace to Eriphyla , which Polynices had brought from Thebes , and which had been Dedicated to Harmony. Amphiaraus being inform'd of all that was Transacted against him, forbid his Wife to take any thing from either of these two Princes; but that Prohibition was in vain, Eriphyla was charm'd with the Beauty of the Necklace, and promis'd to engage her Husband; for that depended entirely on her, Amphiaraus having sworn to obey his Wife in every thing. Amphiaraus was forc'd to leave his Country, but on his departure strictly charg'd his Son Alcmeon , who was very young, that when he came to Age, he should Revenge his Death by killing his Mother. Alcmeon obey'd these orders very punctually, and 'tis this Murder of Eriphyla , by Alcmeon , which the Antients saw with so much pleasure Acted on their Stages. I must confess I think this is a very fine Subject for Action, but not for the manners, at least, if the Father's order was not Confirm'd by one of the Oracles, as some Authors pretend it was; almost all Poets treated of this Subject, but since none of their Pieces remain, we cannot tell how they manag'd it; all we can learn is from a Passage in the third Book of Aristotles Morals, where he tells us that Euripides , did not succeed in it; for the Philosopher ridicules all the fine Arguments the Poet brings to make that Murder look well, and the reasons also, which he also brings to show, that Alcmeon was forc'd to come to that extremity, the Passage is very remarkable. Aristotle speaking of mixt Actions, that is, such that however voluntary they may seem, yet, when they come to be considered in themselves, and void of all Circumstances, appear to be forc'd, says very well. These Actions are sometimes blameable, and sometimes praise worthy, and sometimes pardonable; those are praise worthy when a Man exposes himself to those things which are dangerous, and troublesom to obtain those, which are Great and Honourable. The Blameable are just the contrary, when a Man does shameful Actions for to obtain that which is Dishonest, and of no Reputation; to Conclude, those things deserve Pity, and Pardon; when we do those things, which we ought not to do, in order to avoid some insupportable Extremity. Moreover , says he further, there are some Actions which ought not to be done on these Occasions, tho' we should suffer Death, and 'tis for this reason that all the Excuses, which Alcmeon makes in Euripides, to palliate the Murder of his Mother, are vain and ridiculous, there being nothing which can possibly palliate such an Offence . By this it appears that Euripides did not follow those who said, that this Murder was Commanded by the Oracle; for Aristotle would never have dar'd to say, that an order of the Gods was not sufficient to Authorize that Action; and if he had said it, he would also have Condemn'd the Murder of Clytemnestra , by Orestes , which he does not. 18\. Meleager] Meleager was the Son of Althea , and Oeneus , King of Calydon ; a Week after he was born, the Destinies went to see him, and foretold that he should live till a Brand which lay there on the Fire was entirely Consum'd; his Mother immediately extinguish'd the Brand, and kept it very safe. Sometime after Diana , who was angry with Oeneus , sent a very furious Boar, which wasted the whole Country. Oeneus gave publick notice of a day to Hunt this Boar in, and invited all the valiant Princes of Greece. Atalanta was also there; the day of Hunting came, Atalanta was the first who wounded the Boar, which Meleager slew; and that Atalanta , with whom he was in Love, might have all the Glory, he presented her with the Hide. Althea's Brothers, i.e. Meleagers Uncles, being very uneasy, that a Damosel should run away with the Prize, endeavour'd to take it away from her; Meleager being angry at the violence, they offered to that Princess, kill'd his Uncles, Althea was much concern'd for the Death of her Brethren, and to be reveng'd, burnt that fatal Brand, on the Preservation of which her Son's Life depended, and they were both Consum'd at the same time. The Subject is very fine, and has all the Conditions which Aristotle requires, since Meleager drew on himself his unhappiness, by a Passion which he could not master; you may see all the Story in the 8th Book of Ovids Metramorphoses. 19\. Telephus ] Æ schylus, Euripides and Agathon , have made Tragedies whose Subjects were drawn from the History of Telephus . But as those Pieces are lost, 'tis very difficult to know that History exactly, what follows is taken from a Passage in Strabo , who quotes this Play of Euripides: Hercules passing thro' Arcadia , tarried with Alevas at Tegea , and Debauch'd his Daughter Auge , who was a Preistess to Minerva , and had a Son by her. The Father discovering his Daughter's mischance, shut her, and her Child together in a Chest, and cast 'em into the Sea. Minerva mov'd with Compassion for her Priestess, and for her Offspring, safely convey'd the Coffer to the Mysian Shore, where Teuthras was King, who Married Auge , and afterwards Adopted her Son. Apollodorus relates this History after another manner, for he says, that Alevas expos'd the Infant on Mount Parthinius , and delivered the Mother to Nauplius to be slain. Nauplius gave her to Teuthras , King of Mysia , who Married her. The Child, who was expos'd on the Mountains, was suckled by a Deer, and afterwards Nurs'd by the Shepherds, who called him Telephus , because he was brought up in the Desart, far distant from his Parents. When he was of Age, he consulted the Oracle, to know whose Son he was; the Oracle sent him into Mysia , where he was adopted by Teuthras ; but neither Strabo nor Apollodorus tell us, wherein the terrible Adventures which happened to him do consist, and which make the subject for Tragedy. There is some probability, that he was guilty of some Murder, since he was Banished from Mysia , and went into Greece in the Habit of a Beggar. 20\. And all others who have either done or suffered terrible things .] For all those who meet with such Tragical Adventures, may equally furnish subject matter for Tragedy, since they have in them all a very great loftiness. 21\. Who have done, or suffered terrible things .] There have been very great difficulties started on this passage, without ever being solved, we will endeavour not to leave one scruple unsatisfied on this place. It seems at first sight that Aristotle means, Those who have done and suffered terrible things ; since he said before, that Tragedy ought to imitate the Action of such a Man only, who drew on himself great miseries by an involuntary Crime, that is to say, who has suffered terrible things, after he had done some unwillingly; there is nothing in this which is Contradictory. Aristotle makes use of the disjunctive; or , to denote the difference of the Actions of Men, which might furnish the subjects of Tragedy. In some, what they do is more Remarkable and Outrageous, than what they suffer, as in Atreus's Action; in others, what they suffer is more affecting and terrible than what they have done, as in the Actions of Oedipus . 'Tis convenient then, that the Poet makes use of both these sorts of Actions, provided that he always observes this general and inviolable Rule, that the principal Person falls into his misfortunes by some involuntary fault. 22\. You may be assured then, that the finest Tragedy, according to the Rules of Art, is that, where this Conduct is followed .] There may be Plays, which neglecting the Rules of Art, may not fail to please by the conjuncture of the Times, or the ignorance of the Audience, or by the humour they are in; or lastly, because they have so many fine things in them, as hide their defects. This is the reason why Aristotle does not say in general, The finest Tragedy is that where ,  &c. But the finest, according to the Rules of Art , which is sufficient to show, that of two Tragedies, one of which shall be according, and the other contrary to the Rules of Art, if they are equally beautiful in all their parts, that which is regular shall be the most approved of, and be the best beyond Comparison. 23\. 'Tis for this Reason, that those who blame Euripides for following these Maxims in his Tragedies, and, that the most part of his pieces have a lamentable Catastrophes, are very much deceived . What Aristotle says here of Euripides , confirms the explanation I have given of this Passage, What we see at this day ,  &c. for if he had spoken of the Modern Poets, he would not have returned so soon to Euripides , who was dead above Three score Years before our Philosopher wrote this Art of Poetry. This is without dispute, so we'll pass on to examine this Passage, which is of more importance than it really seems to be. As the Philosopher had said, that those Tragedies were at that time thought the best, which expose the misfortunes of those who had committed involuntary Crimes, so he takes notice that there were at the same time some Spirits too weak, or too nice to bear such dismal Catastrophes. as Euripides made in his Plays, who had however the same Relish with the Ancient Athenians , who see those pieces, whose end was happy with a great deal of Pleasure. 'Tis this sort of People whom he would undeceive, and his Argument is invincible, as we shall see in the second Remark after this. 24\. And that most part if his pieces have a lamentable Catastrophe .] This is so true, that of XIX. Plays of Euripides which remain, ten or eleven are entirely Tragical, Hecuba, The Phenician Women, Medea, Hippolyta; Andromache, The Suppliants, The Troades, The Bacchantes, The Heraclides, Hercules the Furious , and Electra . And there are eight which terminate happily, Orestes, Alcest , the two Iphigenia's, Rhesus, Cyclops Helena and Ion. But that which more peculiarly denotes the Tragical Temper of Euripides is, that even in most of these last pleces whose end is happy, he doth not fail to excite Terror and Compassion, and we may venture to say that the Constitution is Tragical, but 'tis the end which spoils all. 25\. And an incontestable proof of it is, that in all the Publick disputes, and on the Stage, those sorts of Tragedies appear always more Tragical and Affecting ] In order to undeceive those who retained still the Relish of the old Athenians , and preferred those pieces which had an happy Conclusion, to those which had a dismal one; he thinks nothing more proper or effectual, than to shew the wonderful success these last had, when they were Acted before the Learned, or before the People in the Publick Disputes , that is, when the Poets disputed the Prize of Tragedy before Judges, who were established for that end, those pieces always succeeded the best[illeg.] And on the Stage , that is, when they were play'd before the People for diversion only, they had still the same success. If they had pleased the Learned only, those who are refractory, would be always appealing to the Learned, and so the dispute would never have an end; but says Aristotle , they had the Suffrages of the People, as well as of the Learned, and this is an incontestable proof that they were the best. Nothing can be finer, nor more judicious than this decision, it were to be wished that we could follow this Wisdom. We hear some saying ev'ry day, such a Play pleased the greatest part of the Audience, therefore it must be good . This is false arguing, pray who did it please? The Ignorant or the Learned, if they say the People; can any body affirm, that that which pleases the Common People only is fine? And if it pleases the Learned only how we can be assured that the Learned are infallible, and never deceived? There can be nothing then so sure in any one of these Parties. What Rule then shall we have and how shall we be able to Judge of what is fine? This is a sure and certain Rule, that whatever pleases the Learned, and the Ignorant too, is infallibly very Good and Beautiful. Now I dare affirm that there are no pieces which will please both, but those which are made according to the Rules of this Art. And 'tis for this reason, that Aristotle says in the 3d Book of his Politicks, that a multitude judges better of Poetry and Musick then one Man only; for one takes notice of one thing, and another of another, and so among them they take notice of every thing. When he says a multitude, he means the whole Assembly which is generally Composed of the Learned and the Ignorant. 26\. In the Publick Disputes, and on the Stage .] There was every Year a fair opportunity for those Poets, who had a mind to dispute the Prize of Tragedy. They all Assembled as certain Feasts, and every one had four pieces Acted before select Judges, which were taken out of every Tribe, who also took an Oath to Judge according to Right and Equity, without Favour or Affection. There is a very remarkable passage on this by Plutarch , in his Life of Cimon . This is the reason why Aristotle opposes the Publick Disputes to the Stage, where the Plays were Acted to divert the People, and not to have a Judgment past on their value and merit. 27\. If nothing that is Foreign, disturb or spoil the Representation.] Aristotle adds this, because the least thing is capable of spoiling the finest piece in the World; there wants only one Actor to Act worse than he commonly does, either accidentally, or by his Caprice, for that which is well plaid, will seem quite a different thing from what it is, when badly Acted. 28\. And Euripides himself appeared the most Tragical of all the Poets, tho' otherwise he was not Correct, and exact in the Conduct and disposition of his Subjects .] This is a very just and true Judgment of Euripides , he is so unexact in the management of his Subjects, that he often offends against probability and necessity too; his Incidents are not produced of one another, and the Action does not generally make one and the same whole , there is always something wanting, either in the manner of forming his Plots, or unravelling them. Moreover, his Chorus's are often Foreign to the Subject he treats of, and there are but few of his pieces, where some of these faults are not to be found. But this excepted, he is the most Affecting and Pathetick of all the Poets. Sophocles is more Regular, Noble and Sublime, more Equal and Agreeable; he disposes his Subjects, and forms the Manners and Characters of his Persons much better; but as for being Pathetick, he seems to hit only the Violent Passions, such as excite Terror; but he is not so good for those which are soft and sweet, which depend on Compassion; whereas Euripides is wonderful at the former, and the best that ever wrote for the latter; for this was Quintilian's Judgment. In affectibus vero cum omnibus mirus, tum in iis qui miseratione Constant pr aecipuus . None ever knew better than Euripides the manner of the Affections, and to place the most Tender Affecting Words so well to the purpose, that he would make even the most obdurate Weep. The division of those two Qualities, has prevented the Ancients from determining who was the greatest Poet, Sophocles or Euripides. Quintilian would not say any thing on this point, but is satisfied by telling us, that Euripides is the most useful to those who are obliged to speak in publick; but this is certain, that take them altogether, Aristotle would give the preference to Sophocles , notwithstanding the large Encomiums he bestows on Euripides , and this I believe cannot be disputed. 29\. The Fable to which I give the second Place, tho' others have given it the first, is that which hath a double Constitution .] After having spoke of a simple Tragedy and its two species, he comes to give an account of double or compounded Tragedy, and takes notice of the reasons which his Adversaries had to prefer it to the first, and those also which moved him, not to be of their opinion. 30\. As the Odysses .] For the Odysses hath a double Catastrophe, Ulysses and Penelope are happy, and their Enemies are destroyed. Homer hath given us an Idea of all the sorts of Tragedy, his Iliads is Simple , and his Odysses Compound ; but we ought to remember, that that double Catastrophe ought to proceed from one and the same Action. Virgil's Æneis is Compounded as the Odysses is. 31\. Those who preferr'd this to the first, did it in all probability by reason of the weakness of the Audience, to whose Relish and Desires the Poets do generally Conform themselves .] For truly the generality of Spectators have the Weakness not to bear dismal Catastrophes, they say, they make them Melancholy and Uneasy, and they had rather have such Catastrophes as will please them. Aristotle in the third Book of his Morals , has traced the Original of this Error very well, in shewing that Pleasure doth so much deceive Men, and Corrupt their Judgments, that tho' 'tis no Good, yet they seek it every where with the greatest Eagerness imaginable, as if it was the only true and solid Good; and avoid all that is contrary to it, as if it was a real Evil. Wherefore the Poets, that they might Conform themselves to this Humour, and not rob the Theatre of the Happy Catastrophes, invented this double Constitution. According to Homer's Odysses , never considering that what is fine in an Epick Poem, may not be so in Tragedy. However that be, Æ schylus, Sophocles, Euripides , and all the rest, endeavoured to please the Athenians that way. Our Poets have the same reasons to follow the Greek Poets. And 'tis now so much the more pardonable, as we are softer and more ignorant than they. 32\. But the Pleasure which this Fable gives, is nothing near so proper for Tragedy, as for Comedy .] This is a very substantial and true Reason; a Tragedy which ends happily for the Good, and unhappily for the Wicked, neither excites Compassion nor Terror, for there is nothing in the punishment of the Wicked, which deserves Pity, nor Terror in the Prosperity of the Good, and consequently it can give only that pleasure which is found in Comedy. If Aristotle could not approve of those Plays, whose Catastrophe is happy for the Good, and fatal for others; 'tis certain, that he would never have endur'd those, which tho' they have a double Constitution, yet end happily for all the Persons, whose Interests are generally opposite. We have some of this sort among our finest pieces; but tho' he might have Condemn'd the design of these Plays, yet he would infallibly have admir'd those infinite Beauties under which this defect, is for the most part hid; and if he shou'd have banish'd the Poet from the Stage, it would have been as Plato did Homer from his Commonwealth, after he had bestowed a Crown on him. 33: And truly we see in Comedy, Enemies as irreconcileable, as Orestes and Egisthes become at last very good Friends .] That we may rightly understand how this double or compounded Tragedy, gives us the same pleasure as Comedy doth, he shows us, wherein the pleasure of a Comick Poem doth consist, viz . in seeing the most exasperated People agree, and the most irreconcileable very good Friends, at the cost of some poor unlucky Footman, who generally comes off, with a good Beating, or at worst a few days Imprisonment; 'tis just the same in a double Tragedy. The wicked perish, and the rest making a right use of their misfortunes are reconciled, if there was any misunderstanding between them before. I am perswaded that when Aristotle wrote this, he had a regard to the Orestes of Euripides. Orestes and Pylades , after having design'd to kill Helena and held their Daggers a long time at Hermiones Throat, whom they threatned to kill before Menelas's his Face, were stopt by Apollo , who reconciled them, and ordered that Orestes should Marry Hermione , and give his Sister Electra to Pylades ; thus ended this horrible Story, and Orestes became Menelas's Son-in-Law. 34\. And go off the Stage without one drop of Blood being spilt on either side .] This passage teaches us, that those Bloody Deaths and Wounds, which are not permitted in Tragedy, but off of the Stage, and out of the Spectators view, are absolutely banished from Comedy, in which they ought not to be, either by Representation or Repetition. 'Twould be very barbarous to mix Murders with Comical divertisements, that could never be approved of. Comedy is not only an Enemy to Murders, but also of whatever else is sorrowful; we have some excellent Comedies, which seem to err on this account. I never come from seeing Moliere's Misanthrope , but I am sorry for the misfortunes of poor Alceste . Comedy ought never to send the Spectator away uneasy, since 'tis made with the contrary design, of making him merry by something that is Ridiculous. Now that Ridiculous, is never found where there is any Sorrow or Pain. This is so true, that to avoid the same inconvenience which displeases in Misanthrope. Terence adds to his Andria , the Person Charinus , which was not in Menander; ne ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  fierat, says Donatus, Philumenam Spretam, relinquere sine sponso, Pamphilo aliam ducente. For fear that it should seem too Cruel and Hard to leave Philumena without an Husband after Pamphilus had left her to marry his Mistress . This is what Comedy requires and 'tis one of the Rules, which ought the least of all to be broke. From whence the Terrible and the Pittyful proceed. The Error of those who would excite them by Decoration, or by Monstruous Incidents. 1\. The Terrible and Pittiful, may be produced by the show, and the Decoration . They may also be produced by the  167 Series of Incidents, and that is much the better way. These are what may be called  168 master Strokes, for the Fable must be composed in such a manner; that  169 he who understands the things which happen, altho' he see them not, yet tremble  170 at the Recitation of them, and feel the same  171 Compassion, and the same Terror, which, none can hinder themselves from feeling at the Tragedy of Oedipus . Now to endeavour to excite these two Passions by the sight, that is by means of the Scenes , is what the Poet has no concern with, this depends rather on those who order the Decorations, and are at the charge of furnishing the Theatre. 2\. Those who don't Endeavour to find the Terrible; but the Monstrous in the Decoration  172 Err, much more from the scope of Tragedy. For Tragedy is not made to give us all sorts of Pleasure Indifferently , but only that Pleasure , which is proper to it. 3\. That Pleasure is that which by imitation produces Terror and Compassion, and consequently it is Evident, that the Poet ought to produce that Pleasure in us, by the means of those things which he Represents. 1\. The Terrible and the Pittiful may be produced by the Shows and the Decoration; they may also be produced by the Series of Incidents, and that is much the better way .] Hitherto Aristotle has proved, that Tragedy is the imitation of an Action, which excites Terror and Compassion; he goes on to shew at present from whence that Terrible and Pitiful proceed. He begins by the refutation of their Error, who believe, that they ought to proceed from the Show and Decoration, when the Stage and the Actors are so adorned and dress'd, that at first view the Audience is prepared for something Terrible. Æ schylus depended much on the Decoration, for he chose every thing that was frightful. Horror and Death were in his Paintings seen. In the Tragedy of Eumenides , he excites Terror and Compassion by the Show only. His Chorus of the Furies appeared so Terrible, that several Children dy'd with Fear, and the Women Miscarried on the spot. This is not that which is proper for Tragedy, 'tis true, the Decoration ought not to be neglected, it should answer to the Subject of the Play; But that is not the Poets business, he ought to endeavour the exciting Terror and Compassion by the Series of Incidents. 2\. For the Fable must be Composed in such a manner, that he who understands the things which happen, altho he sees them not, yet trembles at the Recitation .] If the Terrible proceeds from the Decoration, he who is Blind, or Reads the Plays, can never be so affected; but both he that is Blind, and he that Reads the Play only, ought to be as much concerned as he that sees it, and consequently the terrible should principally arise from the Subject itself. When we read the Eumerides of Æ schylus , we are very little affected with it, because the Terrible which was in it, proceeded from the Decoration only; but when we read Oedipus , we can't forbear vexing our selves, and feeling those motions of Terror and Compassion, which those who should see it represented on the Stage would feel, because the Terrible proceeds from the subject, and not from the Decoration. 3\. Is what the Poet has no concern with, that depends rather on those who order the Decoration .] If the Terrible was produced by the Decorations, the Ingineers and Workmen would have the Honour of those Passions, which we find raised in us, when we see a Tragedy; and they would be able to regulate them, according to their Skill and Charge they would be at. Every one can easily see how ridiculous this proposition is. 4\. Those who don't endeavour to find the Terrible but the Monstruous in the Decoration, err much more from the Scope of Tragedy .] Some have thought that Aristotle's intention here, was to Condemn those Monstruous Decorations, but the Philosopher does not concern himself with giving any Rules about them. These Monstrous Decorations are sufficiently found fault with, in what he has said of the Terrible ones; for after he has refused those who endeavour to excite Terror by means of the Show, he goes on to another, and no less defect, viz . Of the Poets, who not only depend on the Decorations to excite our Passions but endeavour to do it by Preternatural and Monstruous ones. Nothing can be farther from true Tragedy than this means. Æ schylus has a great share in this Censure, for as his imagination was vast and quick, but extravagant and irregular, he often ventured at those things, which were not only contrary to Art, but Nature too. His Promotheus is full of these Monsters, which Aristotle Condemns, for what can be more such, than his Punishment of that God, where Force and Violence , two persons Nail him to the Rock with vast Hammers? Than the fierce Oceanus mounted on a Griffin , going to see that Criminal on mouut Caucasus ? To Conclude, that the good Io should change herself into an Heifer , to go and talk with Promotheus , and learn from him what should afterwards come to pass? Euripides , tho' he is much more simple, and moderate than Æ schylus , falls however into his fault. In his Hercules Furens , where he introduces Rage , whom Iris by Juno's Order leads on the Stage, that she may take Possession of Hercules . That Monster appears with an hundred Heads, round which are a thousand Serpents hissing, for 'tis thus the Chorus speaks, she made also a very wise and sensible Discourse, with so much Reason, as can never accompany Rage . However, after this fine Speech, she remembers who she is, and doth some things worthy of her self, for Hercules kills his Wife and Children; and surely nothing can be finer than the relation which is made of the effects of that Madness; but the best thing in the World would be spoiled by such an horrible sight. Seneca has handled the same subject as Euripides , and if he did not know how to chuse all that was fine, he has prudently avoided the Monstrous: Hercules might grow Mad, without Juno's taking so much pains. 'Tis doing too much Honour to Mankind, to think there are so many things Requisite to make them Fools. 5\. For Tragedy is not made to give us all sorts of Pleasure indifferently, but only that Pleasure which is proper to it .] All things in the World are appropriated to some certain end, to endeavour to use them for any other, is to destroy their Essence, and to bring them into their first Confusion and Chaos. This is no less true in Natural, than Moral Philosophy. 6\. The Pleasure is that which by Imitation produces Compassion and Terror.] Plato has proved very well in his Philebus , that all the Passions give Men a certain Pleasure, and that they are all mixed with something that is both agreeable and disagreeable; but this mixture is different according to the different Nature of the Passions. That which is produced by Terror and Compassion is not like that which proceeds from Anger and Revenge. Plato expresses that mixture which proceeds from Tragedy by ![](/images/inline/KHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) .  . They Weep smiling . This therefore is the Pleasure, which we ought to expect from this Poem, 'tis the Terrible and the Pitiful which give it, and not the Monstrous and Surprising. 7\. And consequently it is Evident, that the Poet ought to produce that Pleasure in us, by the means of those things which he Represents .] This concludes equally against those, who endeavour to give this Pleasure by the means of Decoration only, and those also, who mix Monstrous and Supernatural Incidents in their prices. What Incidents are terrible and pitiful; How the Poet ought to behave himself, that he may not change the commonly receiv'd Fables, in what is Principal and most Affecting. Three sorts of cruel Actions, and which of them agrees best with Tragedy. The defect of those cruel Actions which are designedly begun, but not finish'd. The Rarity of the Subjects of Tragedy, and the cause of that Rarity. The Slavery of the Poets. 1\. We will  173 endeavour at present to establish , what Incidents are terrible or pitiful. 174 Whatsoever happens is either between Friends or Enemies, or indifferent Persons,  175 an Enemy who is kill'd by, or kills his Enemy, excites no other pity than what proceeds from the Evil it self, 'tis the same with indifferent Persons, who kill one another . But when such misfortunes happen among Friends, as when one Brother kills, or is  176 kill'd by his Brother, or a Father his Son, or a Mother her Son, or the Son his Mother, or do any such like thing, this is what should be sought after. 2\. And for this reason , those Fables which are received ought not to be changed, For Example ,  177 Clytemnestra must be kill'd by Orestes , and Eriphyla by Alcmeon . But the Poet himself ought to invent it, in  178 making use of these receiv'd Fables  179 as he should do; now we will explain what we mean by making use of, as he should do. 3\. We may represent Actions which are done by those who act with an entire Knowledge, and know what 'tis they do, this was the Practice of the Ancient Poets,  180 Euripides followed it , when he represented Medea killing her Children. 4\. We may also represent the Actions of those who don't know the  181 Cruelty of the Action they commit, and who, after the doing it , come to remember the  182 Relation and Friendship which was between them, and those on whom they were Reveng'd , as Oedipus in Sophocles. 'Tis true that in Sophocles that Action is out of the Tragedy. But we see the Death of Eriphyla by Alcmeon, in the Poet Astydamas and the wounding of Ulysses by Telegonus , in the very Acting of the Tragedy. 5\.  183 To conclude, we may manage it so, that  184 a Person that goes ignorantly to commit a very great Crime, may recollect himself before he puts it into Execution. 6\. If we take due heed , there is no other way than these there, at least which are proper for Tragedy . For 'tis necessary that an Action be done, or not done, and that both of them happen by those Persons who Act , either Ignorantly, or with an entire Knowledge, and deliberate purpose. 7\. ' Tis true that this Includes a fourth sort of manner, which is , when any Person goes to commit a Crime voluntarily, and willingly , and yet does not execute it. But this manner is the very worst of all; for besides its being horrible, 'tis not Tragical,  185 since there is nothing affecting in it, and this is the Reason why the Poets have not followed it, or if they have, 'twas very seldom. Sophocles made use of it once in his Antigone , where H aemon drew his Sword against his Father Creon to kill him. On these Occasions , 'twere better that the Crime was Committed, as in the first manner. 8\. The second manner is yet preferrable to this, I mean ,  186 when he who Commits the Crime, Commits it ignorantly, and remembers what it is after he has Committed it, for then the Action has nothing that is flagitious in it, and the Remembrance  187 is very Pathetick 9\. But the  188 third is without doubt the best of all these manners, and which Euripides has followed in his 189 Cresphantes, where Merone 190 remember'd her Son, in the very moment she went to kill him, and in his Iphigenia 191 when the Princess remember'd her brother, as she was going to Sacrifice him. 'Tis thus that Phrixus in Helle remembred his Mother, just as he was going to deliver her to her Enemies. 10\.  192 By this 'tis easy to know, that there are few Families which can furnish good Subjects for Tragedy, as I said before, the reason of which is, that the first Poets in searching for Subjects, did not draw them by their Act, but 193 borrow'd them from Chance, whose Caprices they have follow'd in their imitations , and  194 this is the reason also, why the Poets, at this day , are forc'd to have recourse to the same Families, in which fortune permitted all these great Misfortunes to happen. 11\. This is enough on the Constitution, Nature, and the Quality of Fables, or the Subject of Tragedy. 1\. Whatever happens, is either between Friends or Enemies, or indifferent Persons .] For 'tis impossible to find a fourth condition different from these three. 2\. An Enemy who is killed, or kills his Enemy, excites no other Pitty, than what proceeds from the Evil it self .] 'Tis Aristotle's Custom to refute before he establishes. Of the three conditions he speaks of, he immediately rejects the two last, as no ways proper for Tragedy, for truly when one Enemy kills another, or indifferent Persons kill one another; this doth not excite any other Pity than what the Murder produces in our Hearts, for Men are naturally formed so, that they cannot see Wounds or Death without being concerned at them; but this Sentiment does not proceed from the Person who suffers, but the accident only, so that 'tis rather a sense of Humanity than Compassion; but the Compassion which Tragedy ought to excite, proceeds not only from the mischief itself, but from the condition in which, and the Relation, both those who suffer, and those who cause them to suffer, have done to another. 3\. But when such misfortunes happen among friends .] Whether they be truly Friends, or ought to be so, because they have been so: Under the Word Friendship, Aristotle comprehends not only Friendship, but Parentage and Alliance, as he shows in what follows, and as he has explained himself in his Morals. 4\. As when one Brother kills, or is killed by his Brother .] As Eteocles and Polynices in the Phenician Women of Euripides , and in the Rival Brothers of Mr. Racine. 5\. A Son his Father .] As in the Oedipus of Sophocles, Oedipus kills his Father Lajus. 6\. A Mother her Son, or the Son his Mother.] A Mother her Son , as Merope , who prepared herself to kill her Son Cresphontes, or the Son his Mother , as Orestes killed Clytemnestra , and Alcmeon Eriphyla ; there is a Play of Euripides , wherein these two things happen at the same time, the Mother would kill her Son, and the Son his Mother. 'Tis Ion , where Creusa endeavoured by all the efforts imaginable to kill her Son Ion , whom she took for the Bastard Son of her Husband Xuthus , and where Ion would Murder Creusa , because she had prepared some Poison for him. This double danger of two Persons so nearly related, who did not know one another, has an admirable effect in that piece, whose Subject is not otherwise entirely conform to Aristotle's Rules, and which would by no means succeed now. 7\. Or do any such like thing .] For there are other things beside Death, which can excite Compassion, as Wounds, Affronts, Captivity, Banishment, & c . but the more considerable and terrible the affair is, which happens between these Persons, the more it excites Compassion, and consequently is the more proper for Tragedy. 8\. This is what should be sought after.] Aristotle would have the Poet confine himself to those Enmities which arm Relations one against another and 'tis certainly a great advantage, which the proximity of Blood gives to excite Terror and Compassion, that which doth not happen between Friends, is very inconsiderable. However, there may be certain ties of Love or Friendship, where the Evils which one of the Persons loved, may threaten the other with, may interest us considerably, and have almost the same effect, as if they were never Relations; but then the danger must be certain and evident, that condition is indispensably necessary; if that fails, it is out of doubt, that the Audience will never be touched with it, and of this I can give certain proofs. As for what remains, we must remember, that what Aristotle says here, can be found in implex pieces only, that is, where there is a Peripetie and Remembrance, and which are certainly the most perfect, as Aristotle has already proved. 9\. And for this reason, those Fables which are received, ought not to be Changed, for example Clytemnestra must be killed by Orestes, and Eriphyla by Alcmeon.] As the misfortunes which happen between Relations, are more Terrible and Pitiful according to the measure of the strict Union Nature has united the Person who suffers, with that Person who makes him suffer. 'Tis a true Consequence, that we ought not to change those Fables, which furnish us with Actions so proper for Tragedy. Orestes must kill Clytemnestra , and Eriphyla must be slain by Alcmeon . What Aristotle says in the Xth Chap. That it is not always proper for the Poet to relate things just as they happened, but to tell how they might, or ought to happen, either Necessarily or Probably , is not contrary to what he says here, That we must not change received Fables; Orestes must kill Clytemnestra ; but supposing there was an Historical verity in that case. The Poet would not be obliged scrupulously to follow it in all its circumstances, provided he change not the Fundamentals of the Fable; he is master of the matter, and may take what way he pleases to manage his Action, and this is farther explained in what follows. 10\. But the Poet himself ought to invent it, in making use of received Fables .] This is an important a passage as any in the Book; for the manner, in which he hath hitherto explained himself, fills all the rest of this Chapter with insuperable difficulties, for 'tis thought that Aristotle meant, That the Poet ought to invent new Fables, or make use as he ought to do of the old ones , but he says not so, his own Words are, The Poet should invent and make use of received Fables as he ought to do . He does not say, Or make use of received Fables that's very different. Aristotle doth not speak here of the Liberty which the Poets have to invent new Subjects; he discoursed of that in another Chapter; his intention is, to Teach how they ought to make use of those subjects which are already received; this is servile, and perhaps contrary to the usage of the Theatre, but he must make use of them in inventing himself , that is, he ought to draw from his own Wit, some means which are convenient to make it succeed, and find out some probable Conduct, which is proportioned to the nature of the Action, and which ought not to change it; and this is what he calls making use of as they ought , and what he endeavours to render more plain, in explaining the different Manners, in which all Tragical Actions happen, and in showing us their Beauties and Defects. All this Doctrine is very considerable, and deserves to be Studied with great Application. 11\. We may represent Actions, which are done by those who Act with an entire knowlege, and know what 'tis they do .] An Action is finished or not finished, and that by those who either do, or do not know what they do. The different Combination of these different Manners, produce four sorts of Actions which we shall explain, and take particular notice of those which are the properest for the Stage. The first and most Common Action is, that which is done by those who know it. The Ancient Poets sought for no others, Æ schylus and Sophocles brought only this sort of Actions on the Stage, and it does not appear that they had any notion of the other Manners. 12\. Euripides followed it, when he represented Medea killing her Children.] Aristotle might have quoted also the Electra of the same Poet , where Orestes kills his Mother, in a perfect knowlege of what he did, but as Euripides did not treat of that Fable, till after Æ schylus and Sophocles , the Philosopher would not mention it, and speaks only of his Medea ; because Euripides was the first who brought that on the Stage, and consequently had the power of managing it as he pleased. Aristotle blames that Poet for making Medea kill her Children with a perfect knowledge, and can't bear that he should conform himself in that to the Antient Manners, there is a very remarkable History concerning that Tragedy. They say, that after Medea had, killed the Daughter of King Creon , the Corinthians to revenge the Death of that Princess , killed Medea's Children, and when Euripides was Writing on that Subject, the Corinthians sent Deputies to him privately, to cast the Murder on Medea herself, hoping that the great Reputation of the Poet, would make the Story current, and that the Lye should take place of the Truth. I should be very glad to see any Town so Industrious, to raze out of the memory of Mankind a Passionate Injustice of their Ancestors. But Euripides might have the Complaisance for the Corinthians , in making Medea kill her Children after another manner, in order to give the greater Beauty to his Play: If 'tis true, as Aristotle pretends, that that which he has followed is not the finest; which we shall examine hereafter. 13\. We may also Represent the Actions of those, who don't know the Cruelty of the Action which they Commit, and who after the doing it, come to remember the Relation and Friendship which was between them, and those on whom they are Revenged .] This is the second manner, according to which Actions may happen, 'tis when those who commit them don't know it, and come to remember what 'tis they have done, after they have Committed the Action. This second manner is divided into two, the least considerable for the Stage is, that when the Action is so far from remembrance, that they cannot come into the same piece, as in the Oedipus of Sophocles , for it was so long after Oedipus had kill'd his Father, that he knew his Crime, that the Poet could only take the Remembrance for the Subject of his Play, which is a very great defect. The other, which is much the finest, is when the Action, and the Remembrance come so near together, that the Poet may use them both, without doing violence to his Subject. The Poet should always chuse the last of those ways, if it be possible. 'Tis this, which is the cause of the great success of the Wenceslaus of Rotrou, [illeg.] the Murder of Alexander by Ladislas , is followed by the remembrance, and tho' that piece has on other accounts very considerable defects, yet 'tis never seen without a great deal of Pleasure. 14\. The Death of Eriphyla by Alcmeon in the Poet Astydamus.] There were two Tragick Poets called Astydamas , the Father and the Son; the Father began to appear some years before Aristotle's Birth, and the Son was much about the same Age with him. I don't know which of the two made Alcmeon : That signifies little, 'tis sufficient to know, that the Poet has compriz'd in that Play, the death of the Mother, and the Son's Repentance; but that he might not follow the manner of the Ancients, nor draw on himself the same Reproaches, which Æ schylus, Sophocles and Euripides had done by not sufficiencly. Studydying Nature, in making Orestes stab his Mother, with a perfect Knowledge and premeditated Design; he manag'd his subject after another manner, in feigning that Alcmeon did not know his Mother, when he killed her but afterwards he remember'd who she was. This change is very remarkable, for it shows us, that notwithstanding all the hatred the Athenians had to Kings, yet they were shockt at the Barbarity, wherewith Æ schylus, Sophocles and Euripides made Orestes stab his Mother Clytemnestra. 15\. And the Wounding of Ulysses by Telegonus.] Telegonus was one of Vlysses's Sons, whom he had by Circe , when he was grown up he would go and find his Father, he arrived at Ithaca , where he took some Sheep for his Retinue to eat; the Shepherds put themselves into a posture to rescue them, one went and told Vlysses , who came with his Son Telemachus to repel the Stranger Telegonus , in defending himself Wounded Vlysses , not knowing who he was. You may see the History in Hyginus, Dictys and Oppian . Many Poets have brought this on the Stage, and all under the same name, Vlysses Wounded , because he did not dye till three days after the Wound. 16\. To Conclude we may Manage it so, that a Person who goes ignorantly to Commit a very great Crime, may recollect himself before he puts it into execution .] This is the third manner which he will presently prefer to the other two, 'tis when a Person goes to Commit some great Crime against another, whom he does not know, but remembers him a moment before the execution of his design, and so proceeds no farther. 17\. ' Tis true, that this includes a fourth sort of Manner .] For Aristotle proves elsewhere, that these four Terms, To do, not to do, to know, not to know , ought necessarily to produce four manner of Actions, Aristotle's Interpreters have explained this method very largely, and particularly Simplicius. 18\. Which is, when any Person goes to Commit a Crime, Voluntarily and Wittingly, and yet does not execute it; but this manner is the very worst of them all .] 'Tis with a great deal of Reason, that Aristotle Condemns this fourth manner; for 'tis Compounded of two contraries without any middle which seperates them, to do and not to do , which do not constitute any Action, and consequently is very improper for Tragedy. Mr. Corneille says, that if this Condemnation was not modified, it would extend too far, and not only include the Cid , but Cinna Rodogune, Heraclius and Nicomedes. Let's say then , says he, that it ought to extend to those only who know the Person whom they would destroy, and retract it, by a single change of their Will, without any notable Accident, which obliges them to it, and without any want of Power on their part; I have already taken notice of that sort of Vnravelling as Vitious; but when they do all they can on either side, and are hindred by some Superior Power from obtaining their ends, or by some change of Fortune that destroys them, or reduces them under the Power of those they would destroy, 'tis out of doubt that would make a sort of Tragedy perhaps more sublime than those three Aristotle approves of ,  &c. This is a very considerable dispute, both in respect to the Parties, and the matter disputed of; one of the greatest Masters of the Stage, disputes against the Master of the Rules of Dramatick Poem, and the dispute is to know, whether a Cruel Action, tho' 'tis imperfect, is the most Vitious of all the Actions which Aristotle speaks of: The Philosopher pretends, that tis, and admits of no distinction. Mr. Corneille maintains, that the Philosopher speaks only of Actions which are not finished, and which may be retracted by a simple change of the Will without any notable Accident, which may oblige to it. However, that example which Aristotle afterwards gives, seems contrary to this explanation; For in the Antigone of Sophocles , if H aemon , who had a design to kill his Father, did not do it, 'twas not because he had changed his Mind, but because he could not do it, for his Father avoided the danger by flying from him, but if any example should be conform to the Sence which Mr. Corneille would give to this Censure, to restrain it in very narrow bounds; 'tis certain, that his distinction can never take place. If Tragedy were the Imitation of a design, or an Act of the Will, then these imperfect Actions might make the subject of Tragedy; but 'tis not so, 'tis the imitation of an entire and perfect Action, as we have seen in the definition of it, all the obstacles which Mr. Corneille can imagine to hinder the effecting any thing as greater Force, or some change of Fortune can never change the nature of that Action, and render it perfect; therefore it cannot be the subject of this imitation, and consequently must be vitious; the only difference which may be, is that it is more or less Vitious, according as it is placed in the Play; if it is not the Principal Action, but only an Incident, as in the Antigone of Sophocles , and in the Cid , 'tis not so bad, but if it is the principal Action, and makes the subject, as in Cinna and Nicomedes , 'tis entirely Vitious, or all Aristotle's Principles are false. The only thing Mr. Corneille seems to be in the right of, is, that when those obstacles which make an Action imperfect, cause those to perish, who would have committed that Action, and save those whom they would destroy; that Action may indeed be the subject of Tragedy, provided it has all the other necessary qualifications, but 'tis not the more perfect for that, it makes a double or compounded Tragedy, of which we have already spoke, and which is so far from being of a sort more sublime than the rest, as Mr. Corneille pretends, that Aristotle has proved it has only the second, or perhaps the third place, 'tis this alone, which can excuse the Action of his Heraclius , and that of his Rodogune , which are faulty in divers other places. 19\. For beside its being horrible and flagitious, 'tis not Tragical, since there is nothing Affecting in it .] Those Actions which are not finished, are faulty, not only because they are imperfect; but because they do that which they ought not to do, and don't do that which they ought to do; they do that which they ought not to do, in shewing to the Spectators the Barbarity of a Crime, that is by no means proper for Tragedy, which as has been shown already, admits not of that which is Abominable and Flagitious, and they don't do what they ought to do, because they have nothing Tragical and Affecting, and are as, Aristotle words it, without Passion ; that is, they do nothing which can excite Pity or Compassion, or rather they don't stir up those Commotions which we generally feel, when we see Wounds, Deaths, and all those other Accidents which he hath Comprehended under the General Term of Passion. 20\. Sophocles made use of it once in his Antigone, where H aemon drew his Sword against his Father Creon to kill him.] Antigone having buried her Brother, contrary to Creon's Order, that King caused her to be Buried alive in a Tomb: H aemon , who was in Love with that Princess, went to dye with her; Creon , when he was informed of his Son's despair, went to save him, H aemon , when he saw his Father enter, looked furiously on him, drew his Sword, and struck at him; the King avoided the Blow, on which H aemon stabb'd himself, and fell down on the Body of his Mistress, 'Tis not without reason, that Aristotle blames this Action as imperfect, for besides its being Cruel without any necessity, 'tis without Passion ; but 'tis the less faulty, because 'tis only a small circumstance of an Episode . Tho' these imperfect Actions take no place in Tragedy, yet they have wonderful fine effects in Epick Poems. We are delighted to see Achilles draw his Sword to slay Agamemnon , and Æ neas going to kill Helena . The first is prevented by Minerva , and the latter by Venus. 21\. On these occasions 'twere better that the Crime was Committed, as in the first manner .] It had been better if H aemon had compleated the killing his Father, for the Action would have had the same Cruelty, and there would have been Passion which Tragedy requires. 22\. The second Manner is yet preferrable to this, I mean when he who Commits the Crime, Commits it Ignorantly, and Remembers what it is, after he has Committed it.] Aristotle is not satisfied to name only the four ways, which a Cruel Action may happen between Friends and Relations; but takes care also to set down their Order, that is, to shew which are preferrable to others, and to give his Reasons for it. These are the four Manners. 1\. To Act with an entire knowledge, and to finish what is projected. 2\. To Act with knowledge, and to remember the Crime after it is Committed. 3\. To be just on the point of Acting; but to recollect ones self before the Action. 4\. To Act with an entire knowledge, but not to compleat or finish the Action. Of all these four, Aristotle says the last is most deficient, because it is Cruel without Passion. The next in faults is the First, because it is Cruel, and the Stage ought to banish Cruelties; but it is preferrable to the last, because it has Passion, which that has not. There remain only the Second and the Third. The Second is certainly better than the First, and the last, because there is nothing Cruel in it. Since the Crime is Committed ignorantly, and it hath all the advantages of Passion. The Third is preferrable to all the rest. Aristotle has not given the Reason, since every body must needs perceive it: 'Tis because it engages us more than the Second, that it is not so Cruel, that it answers the expectation and desires of the Audience, who are wonderfully pleased to see two Persons so nearly related, escape the dangers which threatn'd them, after they had been in great pain least they should miscarry. This is Aristotle's Doctrine, Mr. Corneille is of a quite different Opinion, and directly inverts this Order; for he pretends, that the first manner, which Aristotle esteems the least of the three, is the finest, and the third which Aristotle judges the best is the least so, the Reason of which, is, says he, because in the third, A Mother who goes to kill her Son; as Merope did Cresphontes, and a Sister to Sacrifice her Brother, as Iphigenia, look on them as Enemies, or indifferent Persons, till they remember them now, according to Aristotle, neither of these Conditions excite either Pity or Fear. When a Remembrance is made after the Death of an unknown Person, as in the second Manner, the Compassion, which is excited by the uneasinesses of him, who destroyed that Person, can have no great Extent, since it is included, and bound up in the Catastrophe; but when a Person Acts with a perfect Knowledge and Bare-fac'd, as in the first manner, the Conflict of the Passions against Nature, the Duty and Love takes up the best part of the Poem, and from thence great Emotions are produced, which ev'ry moment renew and redouble the Commiseration. To justify this Reasoning by Experience, we see that Chimenes and Antiochus move us much more than Oedipus. There is some probability , continues this great Poet, that what this Philosopher has said, of the divers degrees of the Perfection of Tragedy, was exact and just in his time, and according to the Humour of his Country-men; that I cannot doubt of no more than I can forbear saying, that the Relish of our Age is not like that of his, on the preference of one of these Manners to another, at least that which pleased the Athenians so nicely and exquisitely, would not please our French; this is the only way I can think of to support my scruples, and at the same time preserve the Veneration I ought to have for all that he has wrote concerning the Art of Poetry. The fondness Mr. Corneille had for some of his own pieces, to which this Order of preference which Aristotle establishes is not all favourable, obliged him to take the contrary part, and invert the order; but I dare say, that Love was never blinder than on this occasion; and I hope to demonstrate it without being deficient in the Veneration which is owing to so great a Man. I shall begin at the end, Mr. Corneille's principle, that what was exact and just in the time of the Athenians , is not so in ours, and that that which pleased them, would displease now, appears to me very extraordinary, and as directly contrary to truth as any thing in the World can be. I always believed that this might depend on the Humours and Fancies of Men, and so might please and displease at different times; but I can not perswade myself, that what pleased the Athenians according to reason, can now displease us according to reason too. It seems to me to be a manifest contradiction and impossibility. 'Tis that Reason then which must be examined, what Aristotle says of the different degrees of Perfection of these three Manners, is so true and indisputable, that Mr. Corneille never had any thoughts of finding fault with them: and as they are still the same 'tis a certain consequence that our Relish ought to be in that point agreeable to that of the Athenians , and if it is not, 'tis necessarily true, that ours must be to blame, and indeed it is so: and to prove it, I shall make use of those very examples which Mr. Corneille has taken out of his own pieces. The misfortune of Antiochus in Rodogune , very far from giving either Fear or Pity, gives only (as Aristotle right foretold) a just horror for the danger, which threatned that Virtuous Prince, and a dreadful Aversion for the unnatural Mother, who attempted to Poison him, after she had Assassinated his Brother; and this example plainly proves, that the Commission of a Crime with a perfect Knowlege and Barefac'd, is abominable, and will always be so, when Cruel Actions are exposed on the Stage. Aristotle then had reason to condemn, and Mr. Corneille was in the wrong to defend them. 'Twould be to no purpose to examine that Compassion which Chimenes excites; for his Action not having that Cruelty, of which we now Discourse, it doth not belong to this place. As for Oedipus , Mr. Corneille readily agrees, that he does not excite a great deal of Compassion in his piece; 'tis true, and I have told the reason of it in another place; but it stirs up an extraordinary one in Sophocles , and is very far from being included, and bound up in the Catastrophe, as Mr. Corneille pretends, that it ought to be for it is predominant throughout the Poem, and begins as I may say at the first Verse; and this alone should determine in favour of the second Manner, which is effectually preferable to the first. As for what respects the third, it is certain, as Mr. Corneille , says, that Merope did not know her Son, when she endeavoured to Kill him, and Iphigenia went to Sacrifice her Brother without knowing him, and that they lookt on one another as indifferent Persons or Enemies, but Mr. Corneille forgot that those Subjects were known (for 'tis of them we now speak) the Son, who was Persecuted by his Mother, and the Brother Sacrificed by his Sister, were unknown to the Mother and Sister only, the Spectators knew them, and of consequence must be sensible of all the Passions, which the danger that threatned two Persons so nearly Related, could produce, and since Mr. Corneille appeals to the success his Antigonus , which is after the first manner, has had on our Stage, we may appeal to the Cresphontes of Euripides , which is in the third manner, and the effects it had in the Grecian Theatres five hundred years after his Death, not on the ignorant People only, but the most discerning Judges also. Plutarch tells us in his Treatise, whether it be Lawful to eat Flesh ? That when Merope went to Kill her Son, there was a murmuring among the Spectators, which shew'd not only their Attention, but the Interest they made themselves to have at the misfortune of a Mother, who was going to kill her Son, and of the Son who was to dye by his Mother's Hands; and 'tis impossible to imagine the Pleasure which a remembrance so well placed as this is, does create. We have not Euripides his Cresphontes , but we have his Iphigenia Taurica , and nothing can be more Pathetical, than what Orestes and Iphigenia say, after they remember'd one another. Those Crimes which are Transacted with a perfect Knowledge and premeditated Design, can never cause such Emotions as are proper to Tragedy, nor never so much Pleasure. After having refuted the Inversion which Mr. Corneille would give to Aristotle's Order, we come to the examination of this passage, in respect to what the Philosopher has elsewhere said. The preference which he gives to the third manner, appears directly contrary to what he delivered in the XIIIth Chapter, where he assures us, that a well composed Fable ought rather to end by the Ill, than good Fortune of the Principal Persons . This third sort ends with the good Luck, and therefore it is not so good as the second; this is certainly a very great difficulty. The Learned Victorius is the only Man who has taken notice of it, but as he did not understand what was treated of in this Chapter, and that 'tis by it only, that the difficulty can be solved, he did not attempt to do it; however, a contradiction so plain as this, deserves to be searched to the bottom, to see if 'twas possible, that Aristotle should fall into it. I have already said that those who have commented on this Art of Poetry, have comprehended nothing of this whole Chapter, and 'tis this which made Mr. Corneille to be mistaken. They all thought, that Aristotle spake here of the Constitution of Fable in general, but he only Teaches how Cruel Actions ought to be managed, so that the Fable may not be changed, but made use of as it ought to be, and this is the design of all this Chapter. For example, suppose I would treat of the Murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes; Aristotle gives me here a Plan of four different Manners, in which such Cruel Actions may come to pass. I ought to have particular regard to that which is most convenient for me. The first is not so, because 'tis too Horrible, the fourth is as improper, because it is Imperfect and Cruel without Passion , and beside that it spoils the Fable; the third, which would be more proper, is useless, because it would save Clytemnestra , who must necessarily dye by the hand of Orestes ; there remains then the second only, which I can make use of, it hath Passion , and is not so Cruel as the first; 'tis exactly the same of all other Actions which we would represent. The Poet ought to chuse that manner, which is most proper, and affords him an opportunity to preserve all the Beauties of Tragedy without changing the Action. Thus Astydamus used it when he brought Alcmeon on the Stage, who kill'd Eriphyla . He did not follow the first manner, as Æ schylus did, in his Coephores , and Sophocles and Euripides in Electra . He chose the second, because the certainty of Eriphyla's Death, did not allow him to chuse the third, but Euripides chose the third in his Cresphontes , because the uncertain Tradition of Merope's Action, gave him the Liberty to chuse which he pleased. This is Aristotle's design in this Chapter, who is so far from being guilty of a contradiction, that what he says follows very Naturally. We may remember, that the second manner is the best for single Plays, which are more perfect than the Compounded ones, as has been already proved, as the third manner is without doubt the best for the Compounded pieces. 23\. Which Euripides has followed in his Cresphontes, where Merope remembers her Son in the very moment she goes to Kill him .] 'Tis difficult to know the Subject of this piece. There is in Appollodorus , one Cresphontes of the Race of the Heraclides , who was King of Messene , and who Married Merope , by whom he had three Sons. This Cresphontes was killed with two of his Children, Polyphontes , who was also of the Heraclides succeeded him, and Married Merope ; this Polyphontes was Slain by Cresphontes's third Son, who by that means regain'd his Kingdom. 'Tis certain that Euripides drew the Subject of his Tragedy from this History, I remember I have Read part of a Fragment, which deserves to be repeated for the Beauty, and the Sence which is in it. 'Tis Merope speaking of the Death of her Husband and Children, who says, ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/Sgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) Fortune hath Taught me to be Wise, and take Those things for Ills which should me happy make. 24\. And in his Iphigenia, where that Princess remembers her Brother, just when she was going to Sacrifice him .] 'Tis his Iphigenia Taurica , we must remember that Aristotle praises only the Remembrance in this piece, and the manner of Euripides managing it, to prevent the Horror which Iphigenia's Sacrificing of Orestes would have caused if she had actually done it, and truly Euripides is to be commended for preferring the third manner to the second on this occasion; but otherwise the constitution of this piece is not what Aristotle would approve of. 25\. ' Tis thus the Phrixus in Helle, remembred his Mother, just as he was going to deliver her to his Enemies .] I believe this was also a piece of Euripides . I don't know the Subject, but only that Phyrxus and Helle , were the Children of Athamas and Nephele. Apollodorus gives an Acconnt of their Adventures; but there is no circumstance from whence any hint can be taken, to conjecture how Phrixus could be brought to the necessity of delivering his Mother to her Enemies without knowing her. 26\. The Reason of which is, that the first Poets in their searching for Subjects, did not draw them from Art, but borrowed them from Chance .] He throws the scarcity of the Subjects of Tragedy on the first Poets, who instead of inventing them to furnish the Stage, were contented to take only those which were known; and took from Chance that which they ought to have been obliged to Art for, afterwards it was difficult to overcome and free themselves from that Servitude, as he goes on to explain. 27\. This is the reason also, why the Poets at this day, are forced to have recourse to the same Families, in which Fortune permitted all these great misfortunes to happen.] Aristotle says in the Xth Chapter, that the Poets may invent new Subjects, and that 'tis not necessary to adhere scrupulously to those Fables, which have been always received, and from which Tragedies are generally drawn. If that Liberty may be used, from whence comes it, that Aristotle says here, that the Poets are obliged to have recourse to those few Families? This seems to be a sort of Contradiction, but is really none; however, rightly to understand this matter, 'tis necessary to have recourse to the Origine and Principles of this Art. Aristotle means, that the first Poets neglecting to make use of the Priveleges of their Art, which permitted them to bring feigned Adventures on the Stage, provided they did it under names that were known, (as in Epick Poem) to render them more probable, but they took also known Adventures with their Names, insomuch, that the Poets who followed, durst not take the names only, but obliged themselves to take the Adventures too, for as all the World knew, what those Men of great Reputation had done, that was Tragical and Extraordinary, they were afraid, that if they should attribute new Actions to those Men, the Publick would not believe those things which were really true, and very remarkable; but of which History and Fable should not think it worth while to take notice and that they might preserve in their Pieces, that necessary Veri- Similitude, and Air of Truth, they Religiously followed the steps of the Antient Poets, and Custom imposed this Law on them, whose Yoke they have not yet had the Courage to shake off, by inventing not only new Subjects, but new Persons as they had a mind to. Agathon has done it with very good success, and that is sufficient to encourage them to follow his example. This is the explanation of this passage, which is so far from prohibiting the Undertaking what Fortune has not afforded; to produce new Subjects on the Stage, independent from her, as Mr. Corneille would have it. That on the contrary, it confirms all that Aristotle said of the Liberty granted to the Poets to invent both Things and Names; and what makes this passage yet more considerable, is, that it informs us that the Poets did not use that Liberty, and that all their pieces were taken out of the Grecian History or Fables, which proves that Euripides did not invent the Subject of his Iphigenia Taurica , nor of his Helene and his Ion . for if he had, Aristotle would not fail to have done him the honour to mention it. 28\. This is enough on the Constitution, Nature and Quality of Fables, or the Subjects of Tragedy.] Aristotle takes care to give notice of the matters he speaks of, that the order he keeps, may be always taken notice of, and what follows, may be not confounded with what precedes. This Summary comprehends the nine preceeding Chapters, for he began at the 7th to treat of the Constitution of the Subject. These Things being explain'd, we'll see what the Constitution of the Subject ought to be, since it is the chief and principal part of Tragedy. What Manners are in Tragedy, and the four Qualities they ought to have. How the goodness of the Manners ought to be extended . Euripides's Transgressions against the Manners, necessity and probability must be followed in the Manners, as in the Subject; what the unravelling ought to be. Of Machines, and when they ought to be used. A Rule of Aristotle's which is too rigorous. The Vitious unravelling of the Medea, and the Nature of the Greeks. How Incidents without any Cause may be permitted in Tragedy. How a Poet may, and ought to keep the Resemblance in adorning it. When, and how the Verisimilitude ought to be preferr'd to the Truth. The Ingenuity of Homer and Agathon in their Character of Achilles. The obligation the Poets lay under to satisfy the two Sences, which are the only Judges of Poetry. 1\. There are four things to be observed in the Manners; the first and  195 most important, is, that they be good. There are Manners in a Discourse, or in an Action, as I have already said; when both of them make known the Inclination or Resolution, such as it is , good if it be good, and bad if it be bad; and this goodness of Manners is found in all conditions. For a Woman may be  196 Good, and a Servant may be Good , tho' the Women are generally speaking rather bad than good , and the Servants are absolutely naught. 2\. The Second thing to be observed in the Manners , is, that they be agreeable  197 Valour is a Moral Virtue, but 'tis very disagreeable to a Woman, who ought neither to be Valiant nor Bold. 3\. The Third that they be like, for Manners which are like , are different from those which are good or agreeable , as hath been already said. 4\. To Conclude , the fourth is, that they be equal, and if the Original, from whence our Imitation is taken  198 be unequal in its Manners. We ought to make them equally unequal, tho' the whole Imitation. 5\. We offend against the Goodness of the Manners, when they are not necessary. Such are the Manners of Menelas,  199 in the Orestes of Euripides. 6\. The Lamentations of Ulysses in the Scylla of the Poet , and all the discourse of his Menalippe , in the piece which bears that Name, offend against the agreeableness, for there is nothing more indecent. 7\. That Poet has also offended against the equality of the Manners, in his Iphigenia at Aulis . For the suppliant Iphigenia, whom we see at the beginning , is not  200 that courageous Iphigenia , which we see at the end. 8\. As in the disposition of the Subject, so in the Manners we ought always to seek the necessity, or the verisimilitude; so, that  201 things happen necessarily or probably. 9\. 'Tis therefore evident by this , that the unravelling of the Subject ought to be taken from the Subject it self, without making use of any Machine, as in the Medea , or as in the Iliad upon the return of the  202 Grecians . If a Machine be made use of, it ought to be out of the Action of the Tragedy, either to explain some things which happened before, and which 'tis impossible for a Man to know, or to inform of some thing which will happen,  203 concerning which 'tis necessary to be instructed, for we  204 are all perswaded, that the Gods can see all things. ' Tis absolutely necessary, that among all the Incidents which compose the Fable, no one be without Reason, or if  205 that be impossible, it ought to be so ordered, that that which is without Reason be always out of the Tragedy, as Sophocles has prudently observed in his Oedipus. 10\. Since Tragedy is an Imitation of that which is most excellent among Men ; we ought to imitate good Painters, who in giving to every one their true form, and making them like, do represent them handsomer than they are: The same must be done by a Poet, who would imitate a Passionate and Cholerick Man, 206 or some other such like Character, in setting before our Eyes what such Anger might probably produce, rather than what it actually did; 'tis thus, that Homer and Agathon have formed their Character of Achilles. 11\. All these things must be observed, and besides these, all those which 207 the two Senses require, ought to be satisfied, which are inseparably from Poetry, and the only Judges of it , for it happens, that Poets often err 208 in that respect; but have said enough of this in the Treatise which I writ on this Head. 1\. The first, and the most important is, that they be good. There are Manners in a Discourse, or in an Action, as I have already said; when both of them make known, the Inclination or Resolution, such as it is, bad if it be bad, and good if it be good .] There is nothing in all this Book explained more clearly, than this first condition of the Manners, That they be good , nevertheless some have been deceived, and thought that Aristotle would have them be Virtuous . Mr. Corneille has very solidly refuted that explication, which would equally Condemn all the Antient Poems, as well Epick as Tragick Poems, in which are found abundance of Vitious Persons, and he saw very well, that we should seek for such a Goodness, as was Compatible with Actions Morally Evil, and with those which are Morally Good; but this is what could never be found, the Explanation which he gives to these Words of Aristotle being no better than that of the others, As for me , says he, I believe that 'tis the shining Character, that enhances a Virtuous, or a Criminal Habit, according as 'tis proper and agreeable to the Person who is introduced . This explication would not only damn a great many Characters, which the Antient Poets have made, and which have neither that greatness of Soul nor Elevation, which Mr Corneille requires; but 'tis certain also, that this Quality would not agree with two of the others, viz . the likeness and agreeableness, 'twould be of no advantage to repeat all the other explanations which are made of this place. What Aristotle says, That the Manners ought to be good , is what Horace has thus Translated Notandi sunt tibi mores , as I have explained, that is, That the Manners be well adapted . Whether the Person introduced be morally Vicious or Virtuous. Aristotle himself explains this very clearly. There are Manners in a Discourse, or in an Action, when both one and t'other, make known the Inclination or Resolution, such as it is, bad if it is bad, and good if it is good . The Manners will have this goodness of which we now speak, if they rightly denote the Resolution, which he, who speaks will take, whether it tends to Good or Evil; that is to say, if they are well adapted and well expressed, for a greater elucidation of this matter; the Philosopher adds, and the goodness of Manners is found in all Conditions, for a Woman may be good, and a Servant may be good . That is, that the most vitious Characters, as those of Servants are capable of this goodness, and consequently this goodness doth consist in denoting truly their evil Inclinations; 'tis not at all necessary that the Heroes of Poems should be Virtuous, the most Vitious as Achilles, Turnus, Mezentius , are as regularly good, as Æ neas and Vlysses . The Author of the Treatise of Epick Poem has handled this admirably well; there is nothing more judicious than what he has wrote, and he hath taken Aristotle for his Guide. 2\. Tho the Women, are generally speaking, rather bad than good. ] This passage is no more favourable to the Women, than that of Solomon , who says in the Ecclesiastes , that he found one wise Man among a thousand, but not one wise Woman among them all, Virum de mille unum reperi, mulierem ex omnibus non Inveni . The Philosopher assures us, that they are Subject to more Vices than the Men, by reason of their natural frailty. Aristotle gives an account of most part of them in the IXth Book of his History of Animals; but if that be true. I believe those Vices which they have more than the Men, do not so much arise from the Imbecility of their Nature, as from the Education which they generally have, which if it be not absolutely Wicked, as too often it is, yet 'tis not proper to strengthen their Vertue, and correct their Vices. 3\. And the Servants are absolutely nought .] As the Antients had only Slaves, 'twas almost a miracle to find any of them virtuous for Virtue rarely dwells is Slavery. Homer said, that when a Freeman was put into Chains, he lost half his Virtue: What ought we then to think of those, who for several Generations have been born Slaves, we have no Slaves our Servants are free, but the Liberty which Christianity gives them, does not make 'em a whit the better. 4\. The Second, that they be agreeable .] This is what Horace calls Convenientia singe , to make the Manners agreeable, is to give to every person that which is convenient for him to make him speak and act, according to his Age, State and Condition, 'tis a thing of no small scope. This is one part of what a Poet ought to know, in order to acquit himself well. Qui didicit patri ae quid debeat, & quid amicis, Quo sit amore parens, quo frater amandus & hospes; Quod sit Conscripti, quid Judicis officium: qu ae Partes in Bellum missiducis: Ille profecto Reddere Person ae soit Convenientia Cuiq; Respicere exemplar vit[illeg.] morumq; Jubebo, Doctum Imitatorem & Veras hinc ducere Voces , He that has learnt what's to his Country due, What we to Parents, Friends and Kindred owe: What charge a Statesman, or a Judge does bear, And what, a leading General's Duties are; Will never be at loss, he may be sure, To give each Person their true Portraicture. Take Humane Life for your Original, Keep out your Draughts to that, you'l never fall. 5\. Valour is a Moral Virtue, but 'tis very disagreeable to a Woman .] That Poet who makes a Woman Valiant, offends as much against Manners, as he, who makes her Prudent and Politick, for neither Prudence nor Policy, are the ordinary Virtues of Women. However, there are some exceptions; but then the Poet ought to take care so exactly to to hit the Character, that we may expect all that it may produce. Thus oeschylus makes Clytemnestroe valiant in these Verses of his Coephores. ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἤ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  . Give me my Sword, and I soon will Try, Who shall be Conqueror, and who shall dye. But he offends against the agreeabless, because a Woman who had killed her Husband with an Ax, ought not to be represented as others, and have her Character promise it.

We see that Mars some Women Animates. There is no Virtue which Women are not capable of, if Nature was corrected and strengthned by Education. History and Fable give an account of several, who have been Valiant, Prudent and Politick; for this reason Plato would have them Educated as Men, being perswaded, that nothing hindred them from leading of Armies, and governing States as well as they. Euripides has not observed so nicely the agreeableness in the Manners; for sometimes, and without any Grounds for it, he makes the Women greater Philosophers than Anaxagoras , and sometimes more Politick than Solon ; his is no less faulty, in respect to the likeness and the equality, as will be shown in what follows. I know no good Patterns for Manners among the Greek Poets, except Homer and Sophocles , and among the Latins, Virgil and Terence only. 6\. They be like .] This third quality is only for known Characters, for 'tis from the Story, that this likeness must be drawn, and we must describe them as we find 'em. 'Tis for this reason Horace says, aut Famam sequere, Follow Fame , now to follow Fame, is as the same Horace speaks. Scriptor Honoratum si forte reponis Achillem, Impiger, Iracundus, Inexorabilis, Acer, Jura eget sibi nata, nihil non arrogat armis. Sit Medea Ferox Invictaque, flebilis Ino, Perfidus Ixion; Io vaga. Tristis Orestes. If great Achilles comes upon the Stage, Inexorable, Angry, Fierce with Rage: Let him deny his Right, and Claim by Arms, Though Ino Weeps, Medea has her Charms; Ixion is Perfidious, Io flyes, And sad Orestes moans with Weeping Eyes. 7\. For Manners which are like, are different from those which are good, or agreeable, as hath been already said.) Aristotle had good reason to add this, for most Men are deceived about these two Qualities. They confound one with t'other, and those Manners which are Like, for those which are Agreeable; and those which are Agreeable, for those which are Like. There is no necessity of falling into this Error, and therefore wee'll examine the nature of these Qualities, and mark their differences exactly. It cannot be very difficult to apprehend, since Aristotle only refers us, to what he hath said, of the Goodness, and Agreableness of Manners; and truly the two first being so well explained, we should not be deceived with the third. Mr. Corneille endeavours to prevent this disorder, by separating them, and attributing those which are like to known Characters, and those which are agreeable to invented ones, see his own Words; These two qualities of which Interpreters have had a great deal of trouble, to find the difference which Aristotle would have between them, without assigning that difference; may be easily reconciled, provided they be separated, and that we give those which are agreeable to imaginary Persons, who never had existence, but in the Poets fancy, and keep the others for those who are known by History or Fable, as I have said . But this Medium is useless, and would destroy all that Aristotle has established. The agreeableness ought no less to be found, in the known than in the invented Characters; there must be then a more essential difference; The Manners which are like , (says Aristotle) are those which we have, and which Fame has spread abroad of those Persons who are introduced on the Stage , and the agreeable Manners are these, which agree with the Characters of these Persons . By this tis evident, that Manners may be made like and not agreeable , and agreeable yet not vilified by sordid and pittiful Covetousness, I should give him Manners like himself, if I should make him act and discourse conformably to what was really true of him; but those Manners would by no means be agreeable, for nothing can be more indecent and unworthy of a King. On the contrary, if I should make him Magnificent, and Liberal, I should indeed give him Manners which were Agreeable, but they would not be Like; since they would be contrary to the opinion which was commonly received of him, what must be done then, that we offend neither against the Agreeableness, not the Likeness, in the Character of this Emperor? we must dissemble his Avarice without changing it into Liberality. And 'tis thus Mr. Corneille has used it, in his Heraclius , in the Character of the Emperor Maurice , as the Author of the Treatise of Epick Poem has rightly observed, he very judiciously suppresses this evil Inclination in Maurice , which was not Agreeable, and yet does not attribute the contrary to him, which would be Unlike. To render this plainer by an Example which is greater, and more known; Homer has represented the Gods with all the Passions of Men; he has not offended against the Likeness; since he says only, what Fame had published, but he has offended against the Agreeableness, since he attributes those Passions to them, to which Men alone are subject; nevertheless Plato and after him Proclus , have called what Homer says of the Gods, ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  to imitate irregularly ; but that is not with relation to the Idea, which we naturally have, or ought to have, of an infinite, immortal and almighty being. 8\. To conclude the fourth is, that they be equal. This is what Horace says. Servetur ad Imuni Qualis ab Inc aepto processerit, & sibi Constet. As you begin, so keep on to the end. At the same time a Poet offends also against this last sort of Manners, he offends also against the first and third sorts; for if the Manners be not equal, they cannot possibly be either agreeable or good. 9\. And if the Original, from whence our imitation is taken, be unequal in its Manners, we ought to make them also unequal, thro' the whole imitation .] As what he hath said of the Manners being equal, might deceive some People, and make them think, that they ought to make the humours of the Persons always the same, without any variety. He takes care to inform them, that such a variety is consistent with the equality he speaks of provided that it be in the Original, which the imitation is of, and that they be equally unequal. Children and young People are unequal, a Poet ought then to represent them unequally, and he will not err against this fourth Rule. If that inequality be through the whole Character, Equal and Like, Tigellus , Musitian to Augustus , was the most Uneven Person that even was; Nilfuit unquam sic impar sibi , says Horace ; 'twou'd be against the Likeness, to represent them always in the same Manner, and in the same Condition. They must be made Unequal then, and be equally Unequal from the beginning to the end of the Poem. 10\. We offend against the goodness of the Manners when they are not necessary .] After he has explained the foar qualities of Manners, he gives some Examples of faults which have been committed against them, what he says here, concerning their goodness, may suffice to shew all his Commentators, that that goodness doth not consist in the Virtue, but in the Expression; and that 'tis not a Moral, but a Poetical Goodness; which consists in expressing the Manners, and so well making them known, that we may be able at the same time to perceive what they will produce. Those Manners which are Morally good, may not be necessary, and then, as Aristotle says, they are vitious; if the Goodness of which he speaks were a Moral Goodness, then they might be both Morally Good and Evil at the same time, which is contradictory and impossible; without staying longer on a thing which is so clear, let us see, how the Manners which are not necessary, trespass against this Goodness, and that is not difficult to show. That the Manners of any Person may be good, they ought to let us foresee what resolutions that Person will take: those which are not necessary, offend directly against this Goodness Aristotle speaks of, because they can neither be foreseen, nor be the consequence of those which we know; and therefore cannot be Agreeable or Equal, for we cannot offend against this goodness, without trespassing on the other three, of which this is the Basis and Foundation. The Example which Aristotle produces will make it more plain. 11\. Such are the Manners of Menelas in the Orestes of Euripides.] Menelas arrived at Argos just as they were going to Condemn Orestes to Death. Orestes hopes that the Arrival of his Unkle would secure him from that danger, and truly the Manners which Euripides then gives him, would make us think that he would not forsake his Nephew, for he says, that his Calamity and Distress obliged him to take the more care of him; and when Tyndarus pressed to have the Prince executed, that he might reverge the Death of his Daughter Clytemnestra , he tells him that his long stay among the Barbarians, had made him one too. Menclas answers, that he acted in that according to the Grecian Education, who always had great considerations for their Relations, and thought themselves obliged to do them all possible Service. Nay, he was so transported as to tell Tyndarus , that Anger and Old Age made him a Fool. Thus are the Manners of Menelas well denoted, all that he says is Oratio Morata, a Moral Speech , and seem to intimate that he will take a resolution agreeable to them. But this is contradicted the next moment, for Menelas being terrified at Tyndarus his threats, becomes at once very fearful, and coward like abandons his Nephew. Aristotle had reason then to say, that these Manners are not necessary, for Euripides would have treated his Subject as well if he had given Menelas quite contrary Manners. Mr. Corneille seems to be guilty of the same fault; The Manners which he gives to Rodogune when she proposes to Antiochus and Seleucus the killing of her Mother, are without necessity, and go directly contrary to the Goodness they ought to have, for the Character of that Princess, till then, made something else to be expected, than such an horrible Proposal. The way by which Mr. Corneille endeavours to justifie it, does not do it, and only serves to render it more odious. 12\. The lamentations of Ulysses in the Scylla of the same Poet, and all the discourse of his Menalippe, in the piece which bears that Name, offend against the Agreeableness, for there is nothing more indecent .] We have neither of these pieces, so 'tis difficult to tell the subjects of them. 'Tis probable that the lamentations of Ulysses proceeded from his fear of his being devoured by that Monster. Such lamentations are indecent in a Man of Spirit. As for what respects Menalippe , that she indecence which Aristotle takes notice of was, that she laid before her Father all Anaxagoras's Opinions in Natural Philosophy, to prevent his burning two Children, which he had found in his Stable, and took for Monsters brought forth by some of his Cattle, not thinking that they were two Children which his Daughter was newly delivered of, and put into the Stable to hide her shame. All these Physical reasonings, to prove that a Child might be born of a Beast and not be a Monster, are in no wise agreeable to a young Lady, but very unbecoming. And as the Criticks have well observed, Euripides is often guilty of this fault. Aristotle blames only Menalippe's Character, but Dionysius Halicarnasseus who says a great deal of this Play in his first and second Treatise of Figur'd Discourses, gives us an occasion to discover two other very considerable Defects. The first is, that Euripides has described himself under the Person of Menalippe , and that he might honour his Master Anaxagoras by shewing that he was his Scholar, very impertinently tells, that famous Opinion which was not known in the time of Menalippe, That all things were in confusion . The precaution which this Poet had taken to render this Philosophy probable, in the mouth of a young Princess, in calling his Piece Menalippe the Philosopher , ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif)  , and making her say, that what she spake on this occasion she had learned of her Mother, doth not excuse him. The other fault is yet greater than this, for by that he has debased the Majesty of Tragedy, which does not allow of Philosophical Discourses, which Comedy may indeed use for ridicule. Euripides was guilty of this fault, by following the Comick Poets too nearly, he has a great many good things, but did not always consider that Comedy and Tragedy are Poems very different, and that what agrees with one, is not proper for the other. Dionysius Halicarnasseus speaks of this piece, only to shew the Ingenuity of the Poet, who found out a way for Menalippe to tell her Father her Story, for after she had run thru' all the Arguments she could use, to save the Childrens Lives, she adds by way of Advice; but suppose some young Woman, who has had a misfortune, should have exposed these Children, to hide her shame from her Father, would you then kill them ? by this means she succeeded according to her request. 13\. The same Poet has also offended against the equality of Manners, in his Iphigenia at Aulis, for the suppliant Iphigenia whom we see at the beginning, is not that Couragious Iphigenia whom we see at the end. This Remark of Aristotle's is extraordinarily Judicious. When Iphigenia embraces her Fathers Knees, conjuring him not to deliver her up to Death, she carries her Prayers even to meanness and baseness, and shews such a love for Life, as is unworthy a High born Princess, for she says, There is nothing more agreeable than to see the light of the Sun, and none but Fools can desire Death; and that she had rather live shamefully than die gloriously . After which she makes a thousand complaints, and calls her Father impious ; but immediately she becomes another Person, she loves nothing now, so much as Glory, and begs of her Mother that she would let her die, for the safety of the Greeks , the glorious Victory which her Country was to obtain by her Death, should be to her a Husband, Children and whatever else was agreeable in the whole World. She desires her Mother that she would not put her self into Mourning nor suffer her Sisters to do it, because she was happy, and her fortune deserved rather envy than pity. Mr. Racine has succeeded much better in borrowing all the Beauties of Euripides , and avoiding his faults, he makes a noble Character of Iphigenia , always such, and without any inequality. Before I finish this Remark, I shall make one reflexion, which seems to me very important. That after Aristotle has spoken of the faults which may be committed against the Goodness, Agreeableness and Equality of the Manners, he says nothing of those which may be committed against the Resemblance or Likeness, did he forget it? or is there any part of this Chapter lost as Victorius thinks? Not at all, Aristotle speaks nothing of it, because 'tis next to an impossibility to be defective in the Resemblance on set purpose; for if the Characters which are brought on the Stage, are not known at all, or at most very little, 'tis impossible to err against the Likeness then, because the Poet has liberty to make them just as he pleases. If they are known, there is nothing more easy than to follow them. St. Chrysostom however has observed, that Æ schylus has offended against this third Manner, in his Philoctetes , where he makes Ulysses a dull and severe Man, whereas he ought to be easy and cunning, according to the Idea which we have of him. Mr. Racine has also trespassed against the Resemblance, in the Character of his Hippolytus , for he knows very well, that he deviated from the truth when he makes him amorous, but to hide the defect, and in some measure to recover the Resemblance, he gives him a fierce and savage Love, imagining that our Stage could not endure a Man who had no Love at all. However, I would not advise any to follow his Example; 'tis of dangerous consequence to change known and established Characters. 14\. As in the disposition of the Subject, so in the Manners, we ought always to seek the necessity or the verisimilitude .] After having set down the faults, in managing the Manners, he tells us in two words, how we may avoid them; by always following the necessity, or the verisimilitude. The necessity ought always to precede, that is, we ought as much as we can to make the Persons speak and act as they would necessarily or probably do. A young Man ought not to speak, and act as an old one, nor an old Man as a young; but as it sometimes falls out that an old Man may have the inclinations of Youth, and a Youth the inclinations of an old Man, then the necessity fails, and we must go on to the verisimilitude. If Euripides had endeavoured after the necessity and the probability, he had not fallen into those Errors Aristotle accuses him of. Thus Horace did not forget to take notice of this precept, when he endeavours to denote its extent, by saying, Semper in adjunctis, aevoq; mor abimar aptis. Still to the Age, and Circumstances keep. For what he says simply in respect to Age, ought also to be meant of Sex, Country, Quality, and all those other things by which Men are distinguished. 15\. So that things happen necessarily or probably .] The Probability or the Necessity of the Manners ought to be found in all the Actions they produce, in such a manner, that they may be all of them either necessary or probable, not only by their Nature and Quality, but also by their Order and Consequence, for they must come one after another, either necessarily or probably. All humane Passions have different degrees, which produce different Actions, which must not be confounded, nor put out of Order. In a Word the Poet ought to observe, that all those things which the Manners produce; be in their proper Order, and that they be produced one of another, necessarily or at least probably. 16\. 'Tis therefore evident by this, that the unravelling a subject ought to be taken from the subject it self .] Since the Manners ought to produce the Actions, and these Actions ought to arise one from another, it necessary follows from thence, that the unraveling which is also an Action, ought to arise, either necessarily or probably, from that which precedes it, and which the Manners have already produced. This is an undeniable Consequence. The unravelling of Oedipus arises from the Manners, which produced the begining of the Action. 17\. Without making use of any Machine, as in the Medea.] Aristotle condemns the unravelling the Medea of the Euripides , which is done by a Machine, in which Medea flies away after she had reveng'd her self on Jason for his infidelity, by killing her Rival. I find that that Machine has no foundation in the Play. Mr. Corneille is of a quite different Opinion. I find , says he, that Aristotle's opinion is a little too rigorous; it seems to have a sufficient foundation, by making Medea a Magician, to have related her to be so all along the Poem, and to have done Actions as much above the power of Nature, as this, after what she had done for Jason at Colchis, had renewed Æson's Youth at his return, after she had joyn'd invisible Fire to the present she made to Creusa, this flying Chariot cannot be beyond probability, and the Play had no occasion of any other preparation for this extraordinary Action . Mr. Corneille would have been in the right, if Medea had had recourse to her Art, for this flying Chariot, as she had for all the others. But the unravelling doth not in the least proceed from Medea's Manners, nor from the incidents which preceded it, where nothing was seen that could give the least reason to expect an end of this Nature. Tho Medea was a great Magician, yet she did not owe this Chariot to her Enchantments, but to the goodness of the Sun her Grandfather, who was very desirous to save her. She says, ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ὄ ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) mgr; ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) Ἤ ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif)  . ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . The Sun my Grandfather, this Chariot gave Me, from my cruel Enemies to Save. Tho' Medea had been no Sorceress, yet she would have been saved by the power of that God, and this is the reason why Aristotle condemns it: for tis that which makes the unravelling vitious. Euripides should have done it some other way, by making Medea have recourse to her Art for it, and not to a Machine, and the power of a God, that is the ordinary usage of low Genius's, when they know not how to bring themselves off. 18\. Or as in the Ilias upon the return of the Grecians .] The Question here, is not concerning Epick Poem, for Aristotle speaks only of the Dramatick, he could not Condemn the usage of Machines, without directly opposing Homer's Practice, and entirely destroying the nature of that Poem, when those Machines are as necessary as they are unnecessary in Tragedy, for we may say that Epick Poem, requires every thing to be done by Machine, that is, by the assistance and power, of the Gods. The Poet employs them with a great deal of reason, and which he could not well omit, for the Ministry of those Divinities renders, the incidents, more Majestical and Wonderful. The Gods are the unravelling of the Iliads, Odysses and Æ neids , the Iliads then which Aristotle brings his allegation against, is not Homer's Iliads , but a Tragedy whose Title was the Ileas or the return of the Greeks , and tis very probably the same which Longinus quotes, in his XIII. Chapter, and attributes to Sophocles . The unravelling of that piece is made by Achilles's Spectre, which comes out of his Tomb and demands that Polyxenus may be Sacrificed to him. Aristotle condemns this unravelling . which comes on a sudden, and has too much of the Miracle in it; and the Encomiums which Longinus gives to the same place of that piece, are not contrary to this determination: Longinus praises only, the spritely fine description, which Sophocles gives of that Ghost: But Aristotle does not only condemn the manner in which it is done, but finds fault with the Apparition also. 19\. If a Machine be made use of, it ought to be out of the action of the Tragedy, either to explain some things which happened before, which 'tis impossible for a Man to know, or to inform of some things which will happen, concerning which 'tis necessary to be Instructed .] After having condemned the use of Machines in general, he tells us when 'tis allowed to make use of them. He says then, that they should be employed, in those things only, which are not of the Subject, that is, which are not of the action of the Tragedy. Now those things which don't enter into the subject of the Tragedy are of two sorts, either those which have already happened, or which ought to happen, when either of these are of such a nature, that they cannot be known to Men, and yet 'tis necessary that they know them, then the assistance of some God must be called in, from whom nothing is hid. 'Tis thus Sophocles uses the presence of Minerva in his Ajax , to tell Ulysses , what Ajax had done, the night before in his Rage. Euripides likewise introduces Apollo at the end of his Orestes , to tell Menelas , and Orestes , what was become of Helena , and to inform the latter, what should afterwards happen to him: But the usage of Machines and recourse to the Gods is so limited by this, that it can very rarely happen, that the Poet shall have occasion to use them. Sophocles might very well have omitted the making Minerva descend, to inform Ulysses of something, which she might easily have discovered to him another way. Apollo was not necessary for Euripides , to unravel his Orestes , since he might have done it in some other manner. The Prologue which Venus makes in the Hippolytus of the same Poet, is also contrary to Aristotles rule. Phedra's Son, and the cause of it, might have been well explained without Venus being concerned in the matter. Diana , who comes at the end of that Play, to inform Theseus of Hippolytus 's Innocence, is another needless Machine, since his Innocence, might have been discovered, without the Assistance of the Goddess. Alceste's proposal might have very well been made, without Apollo : And the Dialogue of that God with Death , was not necessary. Minerva also came without any occasion for't, in Rhesus , to hinder Diomedes , and Ulysses from returning into the Trojan Camp; without performing any other exploit than killing Dolon ; and I can't believe that any body can approve of the Stratagem which she used to amuse Paris , by talking to him, as if she was Venus . To conclude, the Troades might subsist, without Neptune's Prologue, and the Discourse which that God had with Minerva . There are only four Pieces of Euripides , in which, the presence of the Gods is managed as Aristotle here prescribes. Those are, the Iphigenia Taurica, Helena, Ion , and Electra : But I am persuaded that Euripides , might have found out some other means, in his Art, to have avoided these Machines. Sophocles was wiser, in the managing his Philoctetes , at the end of which Hercules descends from Heaven of mere necessity, to carry Philoctetes , to follow Ulysses and Achilles's Son, which could never have been done without that Gods assistance. But to return to Aristotle , I can't tell whether he be not too severe, when he would have no Machines employ'd, but only to explain those things which are out of the action. 'Tis out of doubt, that this Law is made for Pieces of the first Rank, and I believe this rigor must and ought to be moderated, and Machines suffered in the unravelling of the subject, provided it cannot be well done, any other way. It seems Horace mitigated this precept, when he is content, to say in general, Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus Inciderit. Let great occasions make the Gods attend, And no slight cause oblige them to descend. And if we take due notice, the practice of the antients is conformable to this Opinion. The Apparition of Hercules in Sophocles's Philoctetes , is not at all out of the action, the presence of the Gods, is more necessary for the unravelling the Play, which would be imperfect without it, than for the Predictions which Philoctetes makes, which are not so absolutely necessary, but that the Audience might be without their Instruction. I put into the number of the Machines, which Aristotle speaks of, that furious storm, which makes the unravelling of the Second Oedipus of the same Poet; for altho' Jupiter does not appear, 'tis he who sends that Tempest, during which Oedipus is buried. We see then, that Machines may be employed, not only out of, but also in the action of Tragedy, provided there be an absolute necessity for them; those pieces indeed where they are used to explain those things which are out of the Subject, will certainly be more perfect than the others, but these will not be vitious; and that is sufficient not to deprive the Theatre, of those pieces, where recourse must be had to a Machine to unravel the Plot. If Aristotle did not approve of those pieces, but where the Machines were out of the subject. 'Tis certain that he would reasonably blame those pieces where the Machines are very frequent. The Poets ought not to be prodigal of their Miracles, and their Gods. Tragedy should leave these Ornaments for Epick Poems, where the relation makes that very agreeable to the Auditor which he would infallibly condemn if it were exposed to his view. 20\. For we are all perswaded, that the Gods can see all things .] The use of Machines, which makes the Gods appear on the Stage, is founded on the generally received Opinion, that the Gods can see all things, and take care of Men; for if, for example there were none but Epicureans in the world, the Machines would be ridiculous, or not suffered, because they would directly thwart their Opinion, that the Gods lead a quiet life, free from all sorts of care, and if Nature sometimes doth those things which seem miraculous, the Gods take no notice of it, and don't interrupt their pleasure. This is one reason why the Tragick Poets conform themselves rather to the opinions of the Stoicks than other Philosophers. 21\. 'Tis absolutely necessary, that among all the incidents which Compose the Fable, no one be without reason .] This is the Foundation of what he hath advanced, viz . That the Machines ought not to be employed, but out of the Action; for says he, among all the Incidents which Compose the Subject, no one ought to be without reason: and which doth not arise naturally from what preceded , what is done by Machine, and the assistance of the Gods is separated from all the rest; for what the Gods are pleased to do, is pure Miracle; it is without Reason so far, as it is above Reason, and doth not come to pass according to the natural order of Common Events, that is, from the Causes which preceded, and therefore ought to be excluded from the action of Tragedy: this is a sure Consequence. Plays would be more perfect, if this Precept was always followed, but this does not hinder, but on some occasions recourse may be had to Machines, even in the Subject it self, as the Ancients sometimes had; for there is a great deal of difference, between that which is without Reason, and that which is contrary to Reason. The latter cannot be permitted upon any account whatever, but the former would be tolerable, if it were not abused. This Precept of Aristotle's doth not regard only those Incidents, where Machines are employed, but extends to all others, of what Nature soever, as the following example will amply demonstrate. Whatever is unreasonable, and absurd, ought to be out of the Action of the Tragedy. The same ought to be observed in Epopoeia , as he advises in the 34 Chap. where this Precept is more circumstantiated, and extensive. 22\. Or if that be impossible, it ought to be so ordered, that that which is without Reason, be always out of the Tragedy, as Sophocles has prudently observed in his Oedipus.] As there are Subjects which cannot be managed without using these Incidents, which Aristotle calls without reason , he says, that they ought to be placed out of the Tragedy, that is, out of the Action which makes the Subject of the peice, and made use of, as Sophocles does of that which is without reason in his Oedipus . 'Twas without reason that Oedipus should be so long Married to Jocasta , and not know in what manner Laius was killed, and making Enquiry after the Murderers, but as that Subject, which is otherwise the finest in the world, could not subsist without that, Sophocles did not think fit to omit it, but has placed it out of the Action which he has taken for the Subject of his piece; that Incident is related as a thing already done, and which precedes the day of the Action. The Poet is answerable, only for these Incidents which enter into the Composition of his Subject, and not for those which precede or follow it. 23\. Since Tragedy, is an imitation of that, which is most excellent among Men, we ought to imitate good Painters, who in giving to every one their true form and making them like, do always represent them handsomer than they are .] This is a very important precept, for informing the Characters the Poet must imitate the Painters, who in drawing the Picture of any Person, preserve the true strokes, which may be called the Characteristick Strokes, for without them, there would be no resemblance between the Copy, and the Originals; but after that, they don't confine themselves to the Object but endeavour to find what will make the Picture fine. They give it a graceful mean, Embellish it with a good Complexion, and a Noble Air. To conclude they omit nothing which can encrease the Beauty of the Person, without changing the true Features, and altering the Proportions of the Shape and Face. The Tragick Poets ought to Act after the same manner, and with so much the more reason, as they imitate more Illustrious Persons, such as Kings and Princes, and they may make them so much finer, as they are exalted above other Men, for those Characters are capable of all the Beauty that can possibly be given them, if they are agreeable to the Truth, and don't destroy the remembrance. Aristotle tell us how this is to be done. 24\. The same must be done by a Poet, who would imitate a Passionate and Cholerick Man, or some other such like Character, in seting before our eyes, what such like anger might probably produce, rather than what it actually did .] This passage has given a deal of trouble to all Aristotle's Commentators. The Author of the Treatise of Epick Poem, has taken it in Victorius's Sence. The Poet also ought to form examples of Goodness or Harshness, when he imitates a Cholerick and Violent Man; or Sweet and Easie, or some other such like Character . And because he was not satisfied with this Explanation, he gives us another in the same Chapter, When a Poet imitates a Cholerick Person, or one who is of a Sweet and easie Temper, or any such like Character, he ought rather to propose models of Goodness than Harshness . Mr. Corneille has taken it almost in the same Sence with Robertellus , for he Translates it, Thus the Poet representing Cholerick, or lazy persons, ought to draw a Lofty Idea, from those qualities which they attribute to them, so that there may be found a very good example of Equity, or Inflexibility . But none of these Translations explain Aristotle's meaning. Mr. Corneille was so little satisfied both with his own, and the others, that after he had run through all the different Opinions, he says, There is very good reason to reject all these Interpretations, when a new one shall offer, that will please better, for the opinions of the most learned are no Laws . I shall not stick to say, that having explained this Passage, in a Letter, which I wrote to Mr. Chevreau , about fourteen years ago, which Letter was read to Mr. Corncelle , who was very well pleased to see the true meaning, of a precept, which had always appeared very obscure, and concerning which he could never receive any satisfaction: He praised this Explication; for he loved the Truth no less when it was found out by others, than when 'twas discovered by himself. The obscurity of this passage is caused by these two words, ![](/images/inline/sbrgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  and ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  : which were not rightly understood; ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  signifies often Probity, Easiness, Goodness , but it also signifies Versimilitude, as in this place; and ![](/images/inline/sbrgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  signifies ordinarily a lazy, soft, condescending, easie Man ; but it signifies also a Passionate, Furious Man , and excells the word ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , see Hesychius , 'tis there in this latter Sence. These words being rightly explained, 'tis easie to Translate the whole Passage. 'Tis thus word for word. Thus a Poet who imitates passionate and cholerick Men, or such other Characters, ought rather to propose an Idea of Verisimilitude, than an Idea of Harshness . That is to say, that he ought rather to consider, what Anger might probably make a Man do, than what he did: He ought rather to work after Nature, who is the true Original than to amuse himself with any particulars, which is only an imperfect and confused Copy, or so vitious that the Poet ought to avoid it. Having explained the Letter of the Text, I shall proceed, to make the Application of the Comparison, which Aristotle has made use of. If a Poet would imitate a Cholerick, Unjust and Passionate Man, he is obliged to keep the true, Draught of that Man, his Choler , his Injustice , his Passion ; but in preserving them he hath the Liberty which Painters have, he may Flatter and Embellish them: and in order to that, he ought not to fix on any particular Man that hath been Cholerick, but he ought to consult Nature, and borrow from her, those Colours which may make his Picture fine, without spoiling the resemblance. The angry Man, may be Lazy, Perfidious, or a Traitor . If the Poet endeavours, to joyn these qualities to his Character, he will spoil his Picture, instead of beautifying it, and trespass against this rule of Aristotle . Let him then seek other Colours, and Nature, who is the true Original, and model of that which is fine will not fail to furnish him, she'll shew him that Valour agrees admirably well with the very Fundamental part of his Character, and consequently, he should give his Hero a large share of it: 'Tis thus Homer has made use of it for Achilles , he has preserved in that Character, all that was necessary from the Fable, but when he was left to his own liberty, he hath used it so much to his Hero's advantage, and set it off so finely, that he hath almost hid his great Vices, by the Brillant of a wonderful Valour, which has deceived an infinite number of people. Sophocles uses the same Conduct, in his Oedipus . He would describe a Man, that is Passionate, Violent, Rash; he always keeps in that Character, what is necessary and proper for the subject; and enhances it, by all the Embellishments it is capable of: He neither makes him a Base, nor a very vitious Man, that would spoil the likeness, but he makes him a very good, and valiant King, who neglects nothing, that may contribute to the good of his People; This is the way by which the Poets set rather before our Eyes, what their Characters can do, according to the probability, than matter of fact: And this is the sence of that extraordinary Precept, which Horace has endeavoured to express, by these two verses in his Art of Poetry. Respicere exemplar vit ae morumque Jubebo Doctum imitatorem, & veras hinc ducere voces. Take Humane Life for the Original, Keep but your draughts to that, you'll never fall. 25\. 'Tis thus that Homer and Agathon have formed their Character of Achilles.] It is in the Greek, and 'tis thus that Homer and Agathon have made Achilles. This passage hath been explained otherwise. And 'tis thus that Homer himself hath made Achilles good . For the word Agathon , which is a proper name, was taken for the Adjective which signifies good ; and this is a sequel of the fault in translating the word ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , goodness , but here is no dispute about goodness , but Beauty; Aristotle says that Homer and Agathon , Tragick Poets, have made Achilles , as he has mentioned; drawn him like, but much finer. 26\. All these things must be observed, besides these, all those which the two Senses require, ought to be satisfied, which are inseparable from Poetry, and the only Judges of it .] This passage is much more difficult than the former; and of as great Consequence: I believe I have found the true sense of it. Aristotle teaches us, that it is not sufficient, to observe all those things he has spoken of, and to form the Characters according to the necessity, and probability, but the Poet must endeavour to satisfie the two Senses, which judge of Poetry, that is the Hearing and Seeing. There are things which the Audience ought to see, and there are others which they ought only to hear related. If this order is inverted; and that is related which ought to be seen, and that is exposed to the sight, which ought to be only related, 'tis such a fault as will certainly spoil the Poem. A Poet has need of a great deal of Judgment, and Ingenuity, not to leave any of those Incidents behind the Scene, which will affect the Audience by being seen: And to hide those which might offend by reason of their Cruelty, or be found fault with for the want of probability. And what is yet worth taking notice of, is, that Horace has explained the same passage in these Verses of his Art of Poetry. Aut agitur res in Scenis, aut acta refertur, Segnius irritant animum demissa per aures, Quam qu ae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, & quae, Ipse sibi tradit spectator, non tamen intus, Digna geri, promes in Scenam, multaque tolles Ex oculis, qu ae mox narrat facundia praesens. Nec pueros coram Populo Medea Trucidet Aut Humana palam coquat exta nefarius Atreus. Aut in avem Progne vertatur, Cadmus in anguem, Qu aecunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi , Some things are best to act, others to tell, Those by the Ear conveyed, don't near so well, Nor with such moving Passions stir our Mind, As what we to our Eyes presented find. Yet there are many things, which should not come In view, nor pass beyond the Tiring room. Which after that, in moving language told, Shall please the Audience more than to behold. Let not Medea shew her cruel rage, And cut her Childrens Throats upon the Stage, Nor wicked Atreus his dire part prepare, Cadmus nor Progne in new forms appear. When one a Snakes, to'ther a Birds shall wear. 27\. For it hapens that the Poets often err in that respect .] He has good reason to say, that 'tis very easie to err in Dramatck Poem, in that respect, and to offend both the Seeing, and Hearing. For nothing is more delicate; and they may be offended a thousand ways, either by shewing those things which they dislike, or keeping back those things they would be pleased with. 28\. But I have said enough of this, in the Treatises which I have written on this head .] He speaks without doubt of some pieces which he had writ on Dramatick Poetry, and called the Didascalies. Aristotle . did not only explain in them the Subjects of Plays, but when, how, on what occasions, those Plays were acted, so that Work was an exact History of the Ancient Poets, and a sure method to resolve the chronological difficulties in the Greek History. these Didascalies which are now at the Head of Terence's Comedies, may give us a slight Idea of it; 'tis pity these pieces are lost. The different sorts of Remembrances, of those which are most perfect, and which the Poet ought to prefer[illeg.]. 1\. We have already explained in that which preceded , what a Remembrance is, there are several sorts . The first  209 is the the most simple, without any Art, and which most Poets use for want of Invention, is that which is made by marks or tokens . These marks are either natural as the Lance imprinted on the bodies of those Thebans , who were Earth-born. And as the Stars which Carcinus made use of, in his Thyestes ; or adventitious: And these latter, are, either on the Body, as Scars, or off from it, as Necklaces, or the little Cradle in the Play called Tyro. 2\. These marks may be used with more, or less Art, as we may see in the Remembrance of Ulysses , by the Scar of his Wound, for he is remembred by his Nurse, otherwise, than by his Sheepherds. Thus 'tis certain, that all marks which are used, on set purpose , to establish a truth  210 have but little ingenuity in them whereas those which produce their effects by chance are much better,  211 and more ingenious , as that which is in the Odysses , when Ulysses's Feet were wash't. 3\. The second sort of remembrance , is that which is invented by the Poet, and therefore it is  212 without Art. 'Tis thus in the Iphigenia of Euripides, Orestes having remembred his Sister by a Letter, is known to her  213 by certain tokens which she gave him : for there  214 the Poet says what he pleases; 'tis not his Subject which speaks and explains it self . Thus this remembrance falls almost into the same defect, which I have spoken of, for the Poet had the liberty to make Orestes be remembred by Iphigenia , by any other token which he pleased, that Orestes could have carried about him . The voice which Sophocles has given to a Weavers Shittle, in his Tereus , is of the same nature. 4\. A third sort of remembrance is that which is made by the Memory, when 215 an Object, stirs up in us some thought, which produces the remembrance, as is the Cypriacks of Dic aeogenes , where he who saw a Picture wept, and his tears made him remember : Or as, in  216 Alcinous, Ulysses hearing a Man play on the Harp, and remembring his former hardships could not forbear weeping, and so was remembred. 5\. The fourth sort of remembrance is that which is made by reasoning: as in the Coephores of Æ schylus , where Electra reasons after this manner, There is a Man come hither, who is like me, no body like me but Orestes , therefore Orestes is come. And as in the Iphigenia of the Sophist Polyides , where Orestes argues thus; as my Sister was sacrificed to Diana , I must also be sacrificed too. In the Tydeus , of Theodectes, Adrastus makes this argumentation; Laius was gone to get news of his Son, he was killed in the way, this is his Grandson, therefore 'tis Oedipus's Son , and in the Phincides , those unhappy Women, seeing the place, where they went to be slain, cried out with grief, that they saw very well that cruel destiny had condemned them to die in that place, since 'twas the very same where they were exposed, and 'tis this reasoning which made them to be remembred. 6\. There is yet a  217 fifth sort of remembrance, which is also made by reasoning, and is followed by  218 false consequences; that draws the Audience, as in the false Ulysses : For his saying that he should remember a Bow which he had never seen, deceives the Audience by that  219 proposition, who expect that he should be remembred by that means, but they are catched by false reasoning. 7\. The finest of all the remembrances, is that, which arises from the  220 Incidents themselves, and which causes a great surprize , by means of its probability, as in the  221 Oedipus of Sophocles , and the Iphigenia of Euripides , for 'tis very natural, and probable , that Oedipus should be curious, and that Iphigenia should write a Letter to Orestes , and this sort of Remembrances, is the only one which is made without natural or adventitious signs  222 8\. The best after these, are those, which are made by reasoning. 1\. We have already explained in that which went before what a remembrance is  .] In the XII. Chapter Aristotle explained what a remembrance was, and it seems at first sight, that which he says here, should immediately follow that, and this is the reason why Heinsius did not scruple to transpose this Chapter to the place where he thought it ought naturally to be; but if that learned Man had given himself the trouble to have examined Aristotle's management, he would have seen, that, as he hath spoken of the Manners, in the foregoing Chapter, and hath shewed, that the actions they produce ought to come one after another so, that the unravelling of a subject should arise from the subject it self, so this was the proper place and time, to speak of the different remembrances, since they generally make the unravelling. We need only take notice of the terms which he uses here, We have explained before ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , which could not have been said, if this Chapter had followed the XII. immediately. It seems that Aristotle foresaw what would happen, for he endeavours to prevent it, in shewing by these Words, that he had not lost the design he had in view, but had his reasons for not treating of this matter till after the Chapter of Manners. But Heinsius seems less to have consulted the Text, than to be prickt with an immoderate desire of changing every thing, in all the transpositions he has made in this Art of Poetry, as also in Horace , we may say of him what Horace says of Fortune. Hinc apicem rapax Fortuna cum stridore acuto, Sustulit, hic possuisse gaudit. With dismal shrieks Fortune is glad, as 'twere, To move things hence, only to place them there. 2\. The first is the most simple, without any Art, and which most Poets use, for want of invention, is, that which is made by marks .] There is nothing less ingenious than the Remembrances, which are made by these marks, that are prepared designedly, and which come unexpectedly to unravel the Plot, when it seems most embarassed, and bring a very profound tranquility, immediately after a great trouble and confusion. These remembrances are ordinarily used in Comedy, because Comedy does not make its principal of the subject. 3\. These marks are either natural, as the Lance imprinted on the Bodies of those Thebans, & c .] The first Founders of Thebes had a Lance marked on their Bodies, and as marks and tokens pass often from the Father to the Son, 'tis said that that Lance appeared a long time on that Race; so long that Plutarch writes, there was one Python of Nisibis , who passed for one of the Race of the first Theban Lords, had a Son, who died, and had such a Lance on his Body, which had been a long time lost, till 'twas revived again in him. Just as we see Warts, & c . disappear in the Children, and appear again in the Grand, and Great Grand Children. This Lance might give occasion to the Story of the Thebans being born armed. 4\. And as the Star, which Carcinus made use of in his Thyestes.] That Star was a natural mark on Thyestes , or some of his Family, as the Lance was of the first Family of Thebes . But as we have not the piece of Carcinus , we can't know how the Remembrance was made by the means of the Star, nor in what manner that Star was on his Body. Robertel conjectures, not without great probability, that instead of the Word ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which signifies a Star, Aristotle writ ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , which signifies Bones , and that he means the Bone of Ivory with which the Gods repaired Pelops Shoulder, and which appeared in his Descendants. 5\. Carcinus .] There were two Poets of that Name, at the same time, one was an Athenian , and a Tragick, the other a Sicilian and a Comick Poet. 'Tis the first that is spoke of here, they both lived about the hundredth Olympiad, and were Contemporaries with Aristophanes. 6\. Or the little Cradle, in the piece called Tyro.] Tyro the Daughter of Salmoneus and Alcidice , was in Love with the River Enipeus, Neptune transformed himself into that River, and took the advantage of that Princesses Passion, for another: Tyro was with Child, and delivered of Twins, Peleus and Neleus , whom she exposed on the Banks of that River in a Cradle, which afterwards served as a remembrance of those Children, who killed Tyro 's cruel Stepmother, in the Temple of Juno . This History is related at large in Appollodorus. Sophocles made a Tragedy on this subject. 7\. These marks may be used with more or less Art, as we may see in the remembrance of Ulysses, by the Scar of his Wound, for he is remembred by his Nurse, otherwise than by his Shepherds .] By this single Example of the Remembrance of Ulysses , which is made two different ways in Homers Odysses , he shews that these marks may be employed with more or less Address, according as the Poet has Art to make use of it. In the XIX Book of the Odysses, Ulysses , is remembered by his Nurse by chance, by the Scar of that Wound, which a Boar had formerly given him in Parnassus , the remembrance is very ingenious, because it seems to be done without design: But in the XXI. Book, he is known to his Shepherds, by the same Scar tho' in a quite different manner, for 'tis Ulysses himself, who shows them the Scar, to let them see that he had not deceived them, but that he had told them the truth, when he said he was Ulysses. Aristotle assures us, with a great deal of reason, that this remembrance has little ingenuity in it, for there is no great occasion for any great address or wit, to have recourse to those marks, which one would have known, and this recognizance, causes neither any great change or surprise. 8\. As that which is in the Odysses, when Ulysses Feet were washed .] That is, as the first remembrance of Ulysses , which was made whilst his Nurse washed his Feet, the Greek says in one Word, at the washing his Feet . The Ancients gave to Homers Episodes, such Names as denoted the Subjects, that where Ulysses is remembred by his Nurse, is called Nyptra , by reason of the washing his Feet which gave occasion to that Remembrance. 9\. The second sort of Remembrance, is that, which is invented by the Poet, and therefore it is without 223 Art  .] None has yet comprehended, how a Remembrance must be without Art because it is invented by the Poet. However Aristotle sufficiently explains himself in what follows; for there the Poet says what he pleases, and 'tis not the Subject which speaks, and explains it self . That the remembrance may be ingenious, it ought to arise from the Subject, and the series of Incidents, and not from the fancy of the Poet only, who having the Liberty to invent what he pleases, deserves no great commendation, for inventing a sort of Remembrance, which he may do a thousand ways. The following Example will make it very plain. 10\. ' Tis thus in the Iphigenia of the Euripides, Orestes remembred his Sister by a Letter, is known to her by certain tokens which she gave him .] There is a double Recognizance, in this piece of Euripides , the first is when Iphigenia is remembred by Orestes , by a Letter which she gave to Pylades , that when he returned to Argos he should deliver it to Orestes , and told him the Contents of it, least if he should chance to loose the Letter, he might deliver by word of mouth what she had wrote to him. This gave an opportunity to Orestes to remember Iphigenia; Aristotle does not say, that this first Remembrance is without Art, for on the contrary 'tis very ingenious, since it proceeds from the preceding Incidents, and 'tis natural, and probable that Iphigenia should write a Letter to her Brother; this appears rather to be furnished by the Subject, than invented by the Poet. Aristotle speaks of the other Recognizance, viz . that of Orestes , who remembring his Sister, embraced her, and told her that he was her Brother. Iphigegenia at first doubted the truth of it, and desired proofs; Orestes to shew her that he did not lie, spoke to her of the hatred between Atreus and Thyestes , and how he had taken away the fatal Ram; he told her, that she had wrought all this Story in Tapestry, where she had drawn the Sun retiring behind a Cloud, that he might not see the Murther committed by Atreus ;  224 to finish his perswasions, he told her, the old Lance which Pelops used in the Combat against Onomaus , when he fought for Hippodamia. Iphigenia was convinced by this proof; for it could only be her Brother that could see that Lance in her Apartment, it being lawful only for Fathers, Husbands or Brothers to come into the Womens Lodgings. The Philosopher has reason to say, that this Recognizance is without Art, and falls almost into the same fault, with Homer's second, when Ulysses becomes known to the Shepherds: for the Poet says what he pleases here, and no Body contradicts him; he might have said any thing else, and none would have opposed it. 11\. Is known to her, by certain Tokens which she gave him .] The Names of those things, by which Orestes was known, are wanting in the Text. Some have endeavoured to supply them, but without any success and I the more wonder at it, because 'tis easy to learn it from Euripides , who names these proofs in two places, ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , which I translate Tokens . The Greek must be read thus, ![](/images/inline/sbEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/etigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  . 12\. For the Poet had the liberty to make Orestes be remembered by Iphigenia, by any other Tokens, he pleased, that Orestes could carry about him.] Aristotle gives here the reason, why this second sort of Remembrance, is almost as vitious as the first, which is made by visible marks, because the Poet might say whatever he pleased, and instead of using verbal proofs, he might have made Orestes shew some marks, which Iphigenia should have remembred. 13\. The Voice which Sophocles has given to a Weavers Shittle in his Tereus is of the same Nature .] We have not Sophocles his Tereus , so don't know what to say, to the Recognizance made by the voice of that Shittle. 'Tis enough to know that Aristotle had reason to damn it, and that he puts it into the Number of the disengenious Remembrances, and truly if it were allowable to give voices to inanimate things; in order to make a Recognizance, nothing would be more easy; but that which seems very remarkable to me, is, that Aristotle speaks of this remembrance, as of one that is without Art, but I think a speaking Shittle, would appear a very monstrous thing in a Tragedy, and I should be glad to know how Sophocles managed the point to make it pass. 14\. The third sort of Remembrance is that which is made by the Memory, when an object stirs up in us some thought which produces the Remembrance; as in the Cypriacks of Dic aeogenes where he who saw a Picture wept , and his Tears made him Remember.] I have added these Words, And his Tears made him Remember , for they are necessary to make out the Sense- Dic aeogenes was a Tragick, and Dithyrambick Poet, he also composed an Epopoeia , and 'tis this last Work which Aristotle quotes. I don't know in what time he lived; we have only some fragments of his. 15\. Or in Alcinous; Ulysses hearing a Man play on the Harp, and remembring his former Hardships could not forbear weeping, and so was Remembred .] This is taken from the VIII. Book of the Odysses. Ulysses being arrived at Alcinous King of the Ph aeces , who received him as nobly as possible, and thought only of diverting him. He made a great Feast, where Demodocus the Singing Man, sung to him, the considerable Actions he had done at the Trojan War. Ulysses hearing that, could not refrain from weeping which Alcinous perceiving, obliged Ulysses to discover himself. 16\. The fourth sort of Remembrance is that which is made by reasoning, as in the Coephores of Æschylus, where Electra reasons after this manner, There is a Man come here who is like me, no Man is like me but Orestes, therefore Orestes is come .] In the Coephores of Æ schylus, Electra going to offer Libations on Agamemnon's Tomb, (which gives the name to this piece) found some Horses so like Orestes's , and saw all about footsteps so equal and conform to hers, that she concluded from thence that Orestes was come; he uses this reasoning which Aristotle here mentions, but it seems to me not very good. Æ schylus did not succeed in the Implex Pieces, that is, where there is a Peripetie and Remembrance too. 17\. Or as in the Iphigenia of the Sophist Polyides, where Orestes argues thus, as my Sister was sacrificed to Diana, I must also be sacrificed .] The Sophist Polyides made a Play called Iphigenia Taurica . In which Orestes was brought to the Altar to be sacrificed, who when he was going to receive the fatal blow from the Hands of Iphigenia , cryed out, As my Sister, &c . which gave occasion to the Remembrance, which is very moving and surprizing. This Polyides was ancienter than Euripides , and consequently Euripides did not invent the subject of the Tragedy of Iphigenia Taurica , as some of the Learned have thought. Change but the Remembrance and that Piece is always the same. 18\. In the Ty deus of Theodectes, Adrastus makes this Argumentation , Laius was gone to get News of his Son, he was killed on the Road. This is his Grandson therefore 'tis Oedipus' s Son .] We have spoken already of Theodectes , but as we have nothing of the subject of his Tydeus , we cannot tell how the Remembrance was made, nor what the reasoning was, all that we can conjecture, is, that Theodectes put in that piece the remembrance of Polynices , by Adrastus in his Voyage to Argos : For that Prince being ashamed to name his Father, by reason of the misfortunes which had befallen him, said only that he was the Grandson of a King, who going to consult the Oracle, to know what was become of his Son, whom he had exposed, was killed on the Road. On which Adrastus reasons as Aristotle relates. Laius went once to Delphos on such an occasion, and was killed on the way by the Son he went to enquire after, therefore this must be the Grandson of Laius , and consequently one of Oedipus 's Children. 19\. And in the Phineides, those unhappy Women seeing the place .] We know neither the subject nor the name of this piece; for 'tis writ so differently that we can make but very uncertain conjectures. That is of no great consideration, 'tis enough to know that we see in this piece, these Women going to be slain, and that when they were arrived at the place appointed for their Execution, and remembring it to be the same place where they were exposed, cried, that they perceived very well that Fate had condemned them to die, since they had been exposed before in that place This made them known; to him who was to put them to Death, and so saved their lives. 20\. There is yet a fifth sort of Remembrance, which is also made by reasoning, and is followed by a false consequence, which draws the Audience, as in the false Ulysses.] We know nothing of the subject of this Play neither; we can surmise that 'twas a Gallant, who designing to surprize Penelope , said that he was Ulysses , and to confirm it, pretends to remember a Bow, which he used before he went to the Siege of Troy , tho' he had never seen the Bow before, the Audience is deceived by this proposition, and takes him for Ulysses , not doubting but that he would be remembred. This Recognizance is founded, as Aristotle says, on a sort of captious reasoning, which consists in giving for the proof of a thing, a single Token, and such an one as may deceive, for a Stranger might know the Bow, and yet not be Ulysses. 21\. The finest of all the Remembrances is that which arises from the incidents themselves, and which causes a great surprize, by means of its probability, as in the Oedipus of Sophocles, and the Iphigenia of Euripides.] Having explained all the different sorts of Recognizances, he tells us which is the finest, and gives the preference to that which arises naturally from the Subject. Truly it is most ingenious, and as it does not appear to be invented, it produces great effects. That of Oedipus in Sophocles , and Iphigenia in Euripides , are convincing proofs of it. There is nothing more natural, more probable, nor at the same time more surprizing; but that of Oedipus is much the better, because it arises more from the very Foundation of the Subject, and is produced in the very moment of the Peripetie, as we have said before. 22\. For 'tis very probable and natural, that Oedipus should be curious .] I have added this Line, because it is necessary to make out the Sence, and I think Aristotle ought to have wrote it. For 'tis blind and rash curiosity which makes Oedipus 's Misfortunes, and the unravelling of the Plot; Plutarch very aptly calls this curiosity, an immoderate desire of knowing every thing, and a torrent which breaks down all the Banks of Reason, which oppose it. 23\. This sort of Remembrance, is the only one which is made, without adventitious or invented signs .] That which renders these Remembrances so fine is, that they are made otherwise, than by invented or adventitious Tokens. He calls an invented Sign all that the Poet imagines, to produce the remembrance without employing visible and portable marks, and which is produced at once, without being prepared or induced by the subject. 24\. The best after these, are those which are made by reasoning .] He gives the second place to those, which are made by reasoning, because they are very often made without any Sign, and if they do at any time use those Signs, they can be only such as are drawn from the Subject, and not invented by the Poet. But we must take notice that the reasoning, which causes the remembrance ought to be very just and exact. That of Adrastus , in the Tydeus of Theodectes , and that of Orestes in the Iphigenia of Polyides , are preferable to the reasoning of Electra in the Coephores of Æ schylus. What the Poet ought to observe for the right management of his Subject. The bad success of a Piece of Carcinus for not following this Rule. What ought to be done to form the Characters and the Manners aright. One must have an excellent Genius, or be an Enthusiast to succee ad in Poetry. The Fable ought to be form'd, and Names given to the Actors before the Episodes are thought of. An Example taken from Iphigenia. The reason of that management. An Essential condition of Episodes. The difference of the Episodes of Tragedy and of those of Epopoeia. The Subject of the Odysses made General and Universal. 1\. We ought first to draw the Plan of the Subject, to  225 write it as exactly as possible, to overlook all of it several times, for in thus viewing carefully all its parts, as if we were concerned in the Action, we shall assuredly find what is convenient, and see the least defects , and the least contrarieties  226 which may have escaped us. 2\. A  227 certain token of the importance and necessity of this precept is,  228 the reproach which Carcinus received. That Poet in the Plan of his Subject, made Amphiaraus go out of the Temple without any ones seeing him, he did not take notice of this defect, because he did not overlook the whole Plan , but when that piece was acted in the Theater, 'twas Damn'd, the Audience  229 would not suffer that he should endeavour to perswade them, that Amphiaraus was really gone out, when none of them had seen him. 3\. The Poet must also, as much as possible, imitate the Gestures and Actions of those whom he makes to speak , for 'tis certain, that take two Men, who are of an equal Genius, he that is in a Passion shall be always the most persuasive, and a proof of this is, that he who is truly moved shall move those which hear him; and he that is actually angry will never fail to excite the same  230 motions in the Minds of the Audience . Therefore a Poet to succeed well, ought to have an excellent Genius, or to be fierce, for the enraged are easily susceptible of all sorts of Figures and Characters , and the excellent Genius's are  231 fruitful and Inventive. 4\. Therefore whether a Poet write on a Subject already known, or invents a new one, 'tis necessary that he orders his Fable in general, before he thinks of making his Episodes, and to  232 circumstantiate it. Thus he will have all his Subject under one view. For Example , this is the subject of Iphigenia done as I mean. A young Princess is placed on the Altar to be Sacrificed, disappears on a sudden from the Eyes of the Spectators, is carried into another Country, where the Custom is to Sacrifice Strangers to the Goddess who presides over it. They make her Priestess of that Temple. Some Years after, the Brother of that Princess arrives at the same place . Why did he come there? To obey an Oracle . This is out of the general and universal Fable. What did he come there for? That's out of the Subject. He no sooner arrived but he is taken . But the Remembrance is made in that very moment, either in the manner that Euripides has imagined, or 233 according to the verisimilitude which Polyides has very well observed in making that Prince say,  234 ' Tis not sufficient that my Sister has been Sacrificed, but I must be Sacrificed too , and 'tis that which saved him. 5\. When the Fable is made, the Names must be given to the Actors, and the Episodes made, but due regard must be had, that the Episodes be proper, as in 235 Orestes , the Madness which made him to be taken, and his deliverance by Expiations. 6\. The Episodes are short in a Dramatick Poem, but Epopoeia is extended, and amplified by those that belong to it. And truly the subject of the Odysses , (for Example) is very long. A Man is absent from his Country several Years ; Neptune persecutes him, destroys all his Companions, so that he remained alone. On the other side all things are in disorder in his Family, his Wives Courtiers spend all he has, and lay snares for his Son. To conclude, having escaped many Storms, he at last gets home, remembers some of his Servants, deceives the rest, re establishes his Affairs, and kills his Enemies. This is what is proper, the rest are Episodes. 1\. We ought first to draw the Plan of the Subject, to write it, as exactly as possible, to overlook all of it, several times, for in thus reviewing carefully all its parts: as if we were concerned in the Action; we shall assuredly find, what is convenient  &c.] After he has told us what Tragedy is, he explains its parts, and shows us, what we ought to follow, or avoid, in the Constitution of the Subjects, and having spoke of what relates to the Theory of this Art, he comes now to the practice, and tells us how we ought to begin when we undertake to make a Tragedy. We ought first says he, to draw the Plan of the Subject; and to review it often, there is nothing more useful than this method, and 'tis for want of observing it, that we fall into very considerable Faults. Tragedy is the Imitation of an Action, which passes into Representation, not recitation, and Consequently is the imitation of a visible Action, which ought to be exposed to the sight. The Poet ought then, to be the first Spectator, to Judge well of the effects it will have. If he tarries till it is finished, before he Judges of it, 'twill be too late, and he will find it much harder to correct its Faults, He ought therefore to lay the Plan in as lofty Prose as he can, and to take particular notice, of what is in every Act. When that is done, he ought to examine it, in respect to the Stage, as if he saw the Actors playing it, before him, and at every thing he sees he should ask himself why's that done? why such an Actor entred? Why he went out? And thus unless he be blind, he must see the least Faults and Contrarieties, which may have escaped him. If the Poets who write now, would follow this rule, we should not see in their Plays, so many things, which not only offend against the necessity and probability, but which deceive the Eyes of the Spectators too. 2\. Is the reproach which Carcinus received, that Poet in the Plan of his Subject, made Amphiaraus go out of the Temple, without any ones seeing him, he took no notice of this defect, because he did not overlook the whole Plan .] This passage was corrupted in the Text, and I dare say, that I have amended it, as Aristotle writ it.

That which escaped the Spectator, which he did not see : For the question is not concerning the Audience, when the fault was committed, but the Poet and Aristotle gives the Reason, and explains the Cause of that deficiency.

Aristotle , says then that a certain proof of the Importance, and Necessity of this Precept, is, what happened to Carcinus in his Amphiaraus , that Prince, had took Sanctuary in the Temple; he must needs go out: Carcinus declares that he was gone out, but as he had not in the Plan of his piece made him go out before the Spectators, he did not perceive that it was contrary to all probability that he should go out without being seen, by any body: What a Poet may forget, who has not his first Plan rehearsed before him, shall be taken notice of by the Audience, who don't love to be cheated; and be perswaded that they did see, what they really did not. 3\. But when that piece was acted on the Theatre, 'twas damn'd. The Audience would not suffer, that he should endeavour to perswade them, that Amphiaraus was really gone out, when none of them had seen him .] This passage is worth taking notice of. None must pretend to perswade the Audience, that they see what, they don't see, and that they don't see, what they really behold: And this Precept is of larger extent, than has generally been thought, for it takes in, all the Probability that ought to be observed in Tragedy, and which is the ground of it. Tragedy is the Representation of one Action only, from which it necessarily follows, that, that Action, ought to be publick, and visible, and not transacted in one and the same place. How then shall any one perswade the Audience that without changing the place they can see an action which passed in three or four different places, distant from one another. In the Cinna we are sometimes in Emilius's House, and sometimes in Augustus's Palace: Moreover, there is a Council, in that Princes Closet where the doors are shut. By what Enchantment is this done. Mr. Corneille says, that we don't take the liberty now, to draw Princes and Princesses, from their Appartments. Why don't we take it, and what is there that hinders us? First of all we don't talk of what is done now, but what was done in that time, which we take the Subject of Tragedy from; those Subjects are not taken from the Actions of modern Kings, but from the Fable or History of the ancient ones: Now in those days their manners were simple and their Kings went abroad with less State and Pomp than they do now. We ought therefore to represent them such as they were; or very like, such as they would be in this our Age. I would have Tragedy take its Subjects new, from the History of the Kings which we know, those who are most retired, and least seen by their people: I say, it would be the Poets fault, if he should not make them go out of their Chambers. Indeed they should not do it for trifles, that is unbecoming them; but that which makes the Subject of a Tragedy ought not to be a Trifle, but a great and a serious Action, and there is no Prince but would go out of his Palace on such an account as this. There ought also, to be good, and very pressing reasons to excuse them from not going out at all. The Women in Grece went abroad, less than the Kings do now; but the Tragick Poets find such a necessity for their going abroad, that they cannot avoid it, without offending against the Probability, 'tis therefore the Poets business, not to bring any Actions on the Stage, but what are important enough, to oblige Princes and Princesses, to appear in Publick: all others are disagreeable to Tragedy, and in no wise proper for the Stage, with what Probality or rather, with what necessity does not Sophocles draw Oedipus , and Jocasta from their Palace, to give to his Action that unity of place, and visibility (as I may say) that was necessary? There is no Prince but may on such an occasion, go out of any Country, in spite of any contrary Custom. Dramatick Poem could not subsist without this; and there can never be any way of managing it found, which can destroy this Liberty. Those which Mr. Corneille has imagined are very faulty. The first is that what is transacted in one Town, has the unity of place: And that that unity may be preserved, by placing the Scene in Covent- Garden , and the Park : I had as lieve, it should be at Rome and Madrid , for 'tis as easie to see without changing the Place, what is transacted at those distant Cities, as to see what happens at two different places of London : The other is that we make use of a Fiction of a Theatre, to establish a place to Act in, as an Hall, to which this privilege shall be granted, that all that is acted in it shall in every respect the probability and exact regularity: but 'twould be better to agree on a place to Act in, where the Poets faults should be counted no faults. I am afraid that is too much agreed upon already, and that our Theatre is such a priviledged place, for we see very bad pieces, pass for good. I related what Mr. Corneille proposed, only to shew that the greatest Men may fall into errors, when they violate these Rules, and go from Nature and the Truth. Another Consequence of this Precept of Aristotle is, that the Audience know, why the Actors come on the Stage, why they go out, and what they do in the Intervalls of the Acts. As we have very few pieces, where this is observed, and we find nothing so difficult as to follow these Rules, Mr. Corneille is willing that the Audience should know why an Actor goes out, when he quits the Stage: but he does not think it necessary that they should always know, why he Enters, especially at the first Scene of the first Act. This is the Consequence of that Opinion, that the Apartment of a Princess, the Closet of a Prince, may be the place of the Scene. There is nothing more false. The place of the Scene ought to be publick, since the action ought to be so, and that place being publick, not one Actor ought to appear there without a necessity for't, and that necessity ought to be greater, and more prevalent in the first Scene, than in all the others. We may easily see on what necessity, the ancients always founded the opening of the Scene. Mr. Corneille is satisfied, that the Audience should know, why the Actors go out of the place where the Scene is laid: but he does not think, it necessary, to know, what they do, during the intervals, neither that 'tis required that the Actors should do any thing, during the intervals, but is perswaded, that they may sleep then, if they please, and not break the continuity of the Action, we find Just the Contrary, according to Aristotles Principles, and that it ceases to be a Tragedy, when 'tis so, for this would certainly ruin all the Probability, if the Audience did not know what the Actors were doing during the Intervals; and if the Actors have nothing to do, pray what does the Audience stay for? 'tis very odd to expect the sequel of an action, when the Actors have nothing more to do, and to be interested, in a thing, which the Actors are so little concerned in, that they may go to Sleep. Tragedy never exceeds the bounds of Truth, or Probability; and those who have a just Idea of it, had rather see, the first Scene of Oedipus, Electra , or Antigone , of Sophocles , than the Plays in which such liberty is taken. Tragedy is indeed a deceiver: but not such an one as Mr. Corneille means, to deceive the Auditor, and hinder him from perceiving its want of Justness, it ought to have, that he may not be displeased at it. It deceives only the Mob in this manner, who have Eyes only for the show, or the Women, who judge of all pieces by the Sentiments, and the Passions, but it does not deceive those who have more knowledge, and for whom Tragedies, are general writ now a days, Puppets, Ropedancers, and merry Andrews, will serve to please the Common People. When 'tis said, that Tragedy is a deceiver, 'tis in praise of the Verisimilitude of its Fictions and Passions. It deceives says one of the Ancients, by such a deceit, which makes him that deceives more Just and Excellent, than he who it does not deceive: and who is deceived wiser, and more understanding, than he who is not deceived. 4\. The Poet must also as much as possible imitate the Gestures, and Actions of those, whom he makes to speak .] As the preceeding precept is for the Subject, this is for the Manners, and the Characters: For these, and the Subject, are the most important parts of Tragedy. He says then, that when a Poet Composes, he ought to imitate the Gestares, Voice, and Air of him whom he makes to speak, for by this means, he will find all that is agreeable to the Character which he Represents. Horace has very well explained this precept, in his Art of Poety. Si vis me flere, dolendum est, Primum ipsi tibi. Tunc tua me infortunia l aedent; Telephe, vel Peleu, male si mandata loqueris, Aut dormitabo, aut ridebo. Tristia m aestum Vultum verba decent: Iratum, plena minarum: Ludentem, lasciva; severum, seria dictu. Format enim natura prius nos intus ad omnem Fortunarum habitum; Juvat aut impellit ad Iram: Aut ad humum gravi moerore deducit, & angit [illeg.] Post effert animi motus interprete lingua. Would'st have me Weep, your self must first begin Peleus and Telephus , I'll then incline, To pity thee, and make your suffering mine, But if you chance to act your parts amiss, I can't forbear to Laugh, or Sleep, or Hiss; Let words express the looks, the Speakers wear, Sad, fit a mournful, and distressed Air. The Passionat, who's full of Threats, must Rave, The Gay, Lascivious be, the Serious, Grave. For Nature works, and moulds, our frame within To take all manner of Impresions in. Now gives us Joy, now makes us all on fire Now casts us down, now Sorrow does inspire And all these Passions doth the Tongue express. 5\. For 'tis certain, that take two Men, who art of an Equal Genius, he that is in a Passion shall always be the most perswasive .] This is a demonstration. If two Men of an Equal Genius, should write of the same Subject, he that should endeavour quietly, to find out those things which were agreeable to that Character, and should employ only his Ingenuity in that Search, would not succeed so well as he, who should employ the same Ingenuity, and add the Warmth and Sprightliness of Voice, and movements of the Gesture: and I fancy 'tis this that Quintilian means, when he says, in that fine Passage of the 3 Chapter of his X. Book. That 'tis not Exercise that makes it easie to Write, but the method also. 'Si non resupini, spectantesque tectum, & Cogitationum murmure agitantes expectaverimus, quid obveniat, sed quid res poscat, quid persona deceat, quid sit tempus qui Judicis animus, intuiti, humano quodam modo, ad scribendum accesserimus. We should write much better if we did not carelesly Loll on our Beds, view the tops of them, and neglect what comes into our Minds; But if we consider what the thing requires, what becomes the Character, what is proper for that time, what the Mind of the Judge is, with due regard had to these, we should be able to Write Men. That is to say , If we our selves were touched with the Passions we would inspire. For that is called to Write like a Man, to Write otherwise, is to Write like an Image. The same Quintilian says afterwards . 'Tis necessary to imitate the Passions often, in which the heat does more than the exactness. In quibus fere plas calor, quam diligentia valet. 6\. A proof of this is, that he who is truly moved, shall move those which hear him .] This is a constant truth, the more a Man is truly touch'd the more impossible is it for others to see him, and not to be sensible of the same motions which agitate him. For the Soul of all Men is like, the same Instrument strung, with so many Strings as there are Passions. Suppose two Lutes well set in Tune together, if one of the Strings be struck that which is Unison to it will move visibly, and will give some sort of motion to the other's. 'Tis the same in Mens hearts to move such, or such a Passion in theirs, 'tis necessary that I touch the same in my own. Therefore Horace said Ut ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adsunt Humani vultus, si vis me flore dolendum est Primum ipsi tibi. Where Joy, and Sorrow put on good disguise, We with those persons looks strait sympathize, Would'st have me weep, you sure must first begin. 7\. Therefore a Poet to succeed well, ought to have an excellent Genius, or to be Furious, for the enraged are easily susceptible of all Figures and Characters, and the excellent Genius's are fruitful, and Inventive .] This is a just decision. Poetry is somthing Divine, and to succeed in it, 'tis necessary to have a disposition improved by Art, or an extraordinary and quick Imagination; for that Madness has the same effects, as an excellent Disposition, the first supplies Sweetness and Liberty, the other furnishes all sorts of Inventions, and thus both of them equally conduce to a perfect Imitation, which is the only aim of Poetry. When Aristotle says, that there must be an excellent Nature, or fury, he means such as is no enemy to the rules, but is lead by the Judgment. Horace takes notice of the inconveniencies, into which the greatest part of the Poets of his time fell, in not knowing this difference, and not believing that a Man was a good Poet, when he was very Mad. 8\. Therefore whether a Poet write on a Subject already known, or invents a new one, 'tis necessary that he orders his Fable in general, before he thinks of making his Episodes, and to Circumstantiate it .] He returns again to the Subject, and least the Poets should imagine, that there was some difference in the management of an invented, and known Subject, he says very well, that of what nature soever the Fable be, they must follow the same method, and first order the Fable in general. The Fable which makes the Subject of Tragedy, is in no wise different from ordinary Fables, as those of Æ sop , &c. except that they are in the number of reasonable Fables, i.e. those that are under the names of Men and Gods: Whereas those of Æ sop , &c. are moral, i.e. under the names of Beasts, to which they have given humane Manners. But they are all feigned, universal, and allegorical. A Poet therefore ought to begin thus; he ought first of all, to order the Fable, to make it general, and universal, without Episodes, names, or any other Circumstances, which may render it particular. Aristotle makes this very plain, by the following example. 9\. A young Princess is placed on the Altar to be sacrificed, disappears on a sudden from the eyes of the Spectators, is carried into another Country , &c.] This is the Fable, or Subject of the Iphigenia Taurica set down generally, and under one view; The Poet may afterwards give what names he pleases to the Persons, and place the Scene any where, where the same Customs are used; for the Subject is Allegorical, and Universal. 10\. Why did he come there? To obey an Oracle. This is out of the general, and universal Fable, what did he come there for? That's out of the Subject .] This passage is very remarkable; In the Plan of the Subject of Iphigenia Taurica , the Poet might very well make that Princesse's Brother go into the County where she was, in obedience to an Oracle; for that may be general, and universal; but he doth not say what gave occasion to that Oracle; that particularity had made the Fable no longer general, but particular. He does not put what he went to do there; for that is out of the Subject. Thus the Poet has only the general, and universal Fable before his eyes: He afterwards disposes the rest, as he judges proper, and according to the names which he gives his Persons. 11\. But the remembrance is made in that very moment, either as Euripides hath imagined, or according to the verisimilitude, which Polyides has very well observed .] We saw in the precedeing Chapter, the difference between these two Remembrances, in Euripides, Orestes remembred Iphigenia , by a Letter, which was very natural, but he is remembred by her, only, by certain tokens which she gave him, and this second remembrance, is not near so good, and Ingenious, as that of Polyides , in making Orestes remembred, by what he said, Just as he was going to be sacrificed; that Recognizance has an infinite advantage over the other, in all respects, and 'tis impossible not to perceive it. 12\. When the Fable is made, the Names must be given to the Actors, and the Episodes made .] 'Tis very easie to discern, the reason of this management. After the Fable is formed, the names must be given to the Actors, before the Episodes are made; for if those from whom the names are borrowed, have done any remarkable actions, the Poet should endeavour, to make use of them, and accomodate those truths to the ground of his Fable, which is a pure Fiction: And take all the advantages possible, to render that feigned action more probable, according to the rules of Art, and to mix it, with the truth of the History. Horace , has admirably explained this in the two following Verses. Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet, Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum. And mixes Truth and Fiction skillfully, That nothing in the whole may disagree. The Fiction is the Fable, the Truth are the Episodes, drawn from the real actions of those, from whom the names are borrowed. This is the Secret of Dramatick , and Epic Poem. If we should give to the Persons of that Fable, that Aristotle mentions, any other names than Iphigenia, Orestes, Pylades , and should for example call the Princess, Jeptha's Daughter , 'tis plain, that the Episodes which Euripides has used, would not be agreeable, to the History of that Princess, and others must be chosen out of the History of her Family. If Homer might have done the same, and given other names in his Fable, the Fable had not changed its nature, but the Episodes must have been different, for they must be proper as Aristotle goes on to explain. 13\. But due regard must be had, that the Episodes be proper .] The Episodes must be proper, that is, taken from the very foundation of the Fable, in relation to the names of the Persons, and that those be so link't with the Fable, which is rendered particular, by this imposition of names, that the Episodes cannot be left out; In a word they ought to be necessary, and natural parts of the action it self; so that if after the Fable was made the names given, and the Episodes added, other names were given, the Episodes should not be proper, but must necessarily be changed. The following example will give a great light to this matter. 14\. As in Orestes, the madness which made him be taken, and his deliverance by expiations .] To shew us what proper Episode, are, Aristotle , quotes two, which Euripides used in the abovementioned Fable: the first is the access of the madness which caused Orestes to be seized by the Shepherds. One of the Shepherds who brought Orestes and Pylades to Iphigenia , tells her. That, during those things, one of those Strangers tore his Hair, and trembling cast himself into a deep sighing, his fury encreased, and he cried out, with a terrible noise, see that Fury, see how she falls on me, to destroy me! Look how she excites all the Serpents she is accompanied with, against me, behold the other too, who is encompassed with Fire, and all bedawb'd with blood! Look! see how she comes! She's griping in her arms my Dear Mother, whom she's going to throw on the craggy Rocks! good Gods I'm lost! whither shall I fly? at the same time he changed his countenance, and did not seem to be the same Man. Sometimes he bellowed like a Bull; then sometimes roared out; like a Fury: As for our part, we were dismaid; and fearing that we should all be killed, thought of nothing but hiding our selves, and flying from his sight; but in a moment; he drew his Sword, and cast himself into the midst of our Flocks, where he made such a slaughter; that the foam of the Sea, was red with the blood, and he hoped by such a sacrifice to appease the enraged Goddesses. All of us, who were there, seeing our Flocks thus misused, armed for our defence, and with our Horns allarmed the neighbouring Villages, not thinking that a few fearful Shepherds were sufficient to resist two such Couragious Strangers, our number presently encreased, when this youngman being a little recovered from his raging, fell down foaming at the mouth, we taking our advantage of this seized on him that was left alone ,  &c. This is the first Episode, the second is the deliverance of Orestes , by means of expiations: For Iphigenia made use of this pretence to save him. She told the King Thoas , that those Strangers being stained with domestick Murder could not be agreeable victims, till they were washed in the Sea, and that the Statue of the Goddess must be also wash'd, because it had been profaned, by the presence of those Murderers. Thoas commended the Piety, and care of the Princess, and give her liberty, to make those purifications, as she pleased. Iphigenia, Orestes , and Pylades , taking the opportunity embarked, and carried along with them the Goddesses Statue. We see plainly, that if other names than Orestes and Iphigenia , had been given to the Persons, these Episodes would not be proper and agreeable to the Fable, they not being drawn from the Subject, and consequently manifest that the Episodes ought to be made, after the names are imposed, if we would have them convenient and make a part of the action. But you may say, cannot the Episodes be made before the giving the names to the persons? it may be done, but those Episodes will be general, and universal, and no ways contribute to render the action credible, and give it all the appearance of Truth: This is one of the greatest defects of most of our Tragedies; the Episodes are general, and would agree as well with the Fable, tho' the persons had other names. The Author of the Treatise on Epick Poem was much deceived in this passage. 15\. The Episodes are short, in a dramatick Poem but Epopoeia, is extended and amplified by those that belong to it .] The Episodes of a Tragedy, ought to be infinitely shorter, than those of an Epick Poem, for these two reasons: The first is, That Tragedy is much shorter, since 'tis confined to one Course of the Sun, but an Epick Poem has no set time. The second is, because Tragedy is a representation, and Epick Poem a recitation, and this is the reason why it ought to be extended and amplified by its Episodes. 16\. And truly the subject of the Odysses, ( for example) is very long .] I fancy Aristotle writ, and truly (for example) the subject of the Odysses, is not very long ; for if we consider that subject by it self, without the Episodes, 'tis not longer than that of Iphigenia , but when Aristotle says, that the Subject is very long , he considered the subject, with all the Circumstances and Episodes which make the length of it, and inform us also that the Circumstances are no less of the Action than the Subject it self. A man is absent from his Country several years , Neptune persecutes him , &c.] This is the Subject of the Odysses , simple and without any Episodes, reduced under one view, according to the method he has taught us: The Fable is general and universal, there is neither Name, Country, or Person, and the Poet, may give what he pleases to it. 18\. This is what is proper, the rest are Episodes.] Ulysses's absence and Neptune's anger, the loss of that prince's Companions, the disorders of his Family, the Storms he was in, his return, and restablishment, are the parts which Aristotle calls proper, because they are parts of the Action, and cannot be changed without overthrowing the Design, destroying the Fable and making another Poem. The rest says he are the Episodes , as the adventures of Antiphales, Polyphemus, Circe , the Sirens, Scylla, Charybdis, Calypso , and Alcinous Homer was at liberty, to have used any other Episodes, instead of these, without changing the Fable; thus the Episodes were at first proper, and necessary parts of the Subject, since it depended entirely on the Poet, whether he would use them or no, but Homer knew how to make them proper and necessary, by rendering them parts of the Action; we must take notice, that the Episodes are not added to the principal Action, but only dilate and encrease that principal Action; that is to say, that every part of the Fable, being told singly, is the matter and grounds of an Episode, but related with all the Circumstances of Time, Place, Persons, 'tis no longer a simple, but an Episodick Action, and thereby rendered proper and necessary to the Subject, as the Author of the Treatise of Epick Poem, has very well explained. Of the Plot and the unravelling. The four sorts of Tragedy, The Injustice of the Athenians. Tragick Poets excellent, in the several sorts. How Plays may be alike, or different, whether by the management, or the subject. Epick mixture is vitious in Tragedy, the reason, and proof of this truth. Praise of Æschylus and Euripides, the reason of the ill success of some of Agathon's Pieces. Simple unravellings may be Tragical and agreeable . Agathon's saying on the verisimilitude. What the Chorus is, and all it ought to do. 'Tis an essential part of Tragedy . Sophocles blamed, and Euripides praised, for their Chorus's. Strange Songs introduced by Agathon. How those forreign Songs are vitious. 1\.  236 incidents which happen without, and very often part of those, which the Poet draws from the Subject make the Plot, all the rest is the unravelling. 2\. I call the Plot all that part of the Tragedy, from the beginning to that place where, the affairs change their face.  237 I call the unravelling all that is from that change, to the end. For example, in the Lynceus of Theodectes , all that happens till the taking that Prince  238 is the Plot; and the unravelling  239 begins at the place where that Child complains of his Death, and accuses the Destinies of Cruelty and Injustice. 3\. We have said, that Tragedy has four parts. There are also four sorts of Tragedy, The first is the implex Tragedy which consisteth entirely in the Peripetie and Remembrance. The second is the Pathetick, as  240 Ajax , and the Ixions . The third is the Moral as the Phthiotides , and Peleus. To conclude the fourth, as Pherecydes , and Promethus , and all that is transacted in Hell. 4\. We should endeavour to succeed in all these four sorts, or at least  241 in the greatest part of them, and the most important, especially now, when every one pretends to  242 Criticise on the Poets. For because there have been excellent Men in every one of these kinds. 'tis expected that one only, ought to surpass all that they have done, in what was proper and particular to themselves. 5\. It seems to me unjust to say that a piece is the same with or different from another, because the subject, is the same or different. In my opinion 'twould be more reasonable to say that, of pieces whose Plot and unravelling are the same or different. 6\. Most of the Poets after they have laid the Plot well, unravel it very ill; but they ought to succeed in one as well as the other. 7\. Above all, they should remember very well, as has been often said already, not to make a Tragedy with an Epick  243 Complication. I call an Epick Complication a Complication of several Fables, as if all the Iliad should be put into one Tragedy. In an Epick Poem  244 every part receives its just magnitude, by reason of the length of the Poem; but in Tragedy it happens quite otherwise than was expected: And  245 we may be convinced of this truth, by the ill success of those who have put (for example) all the destruction of Troy into one piece, and not managed that subject in parts, as Euripides treated his Niobe , and Medea ,  246 or as Æ schylus did: for they either saw their Pieces damn'd, or were overcome, and this was the only cause of Agathons misfortune, for otherwise all those Poets are admirable in their Peripeties and simple unravellings, which are Tragical, and  247 cause a great deal of pleasure. For the Tragical and agreeable are found together: (for example ) we see a wise Man, but wicked, that is deceived, as a Sisyphus , or valiant but unjust Man that is conquered. All this is probable, for as Agathon says. There are in the Probability several things which happen contrary to the Probability. 8\. The Chorus must  248 also take the part of an Actor, so that it makes one of the whole, and sing nothing, but what is agreeable to the Subject, and which concurs with the advancement of the action, as in Sophocles , and not as in Euripides . In all the other Poets 'tis yet worse for the Chorus's 249 belong no more to the Subject they treat of, than to any other Tragedy.  250 'Tis for this reason, that they sing Songs which are inserted without any relation, Agathon was the first that introduced this Mal-practice . However what difference is there between singing such adventitious Songs, and transporting any long discourse or Episode entirely, from one piece to another. 1\. An whole Tragedy is composed of a Plot, and an Unravelling it. The Incidents which happen without, and very often, part of those which the Poet draws from the Subject, make the Plot, all the rest is the Unravelling  .] After Aristotle has taught how a Fable ought to be formed, the Names given to the Actors, and the Action made Episodick, he comes to the two parts of the Fable, which are the Plot and the Unravelling . The Plot comprehends all the Obstacles which traverse the designs of the principal Person, or Persons, if there be more than one. Most part of these hindrances are generally forreign, that is, which the Poet takes out of the Fable; there are some also which are proper to the Fable, as in the Iphigenia Taurica , the Shepherds who take Orestes , make one of these forreign Obstacles, and the Madness which carried him to fall on their Flocks, is a natural and proper one. The Plots of the Ilias, Odysses and Æ neids , have more of the forreign Obstacles than any other pieces, but although they are forreign, and out of the Fable, the Poet so appropriates them to the Action, that they seem to be proper and necessary parts: For the Unravelling, like an Episode, ought always to arise naturally from the Subject. 2\. I call the Plot, all that part of the Tragedy, from the beginning to that place, where the Affairs begin to change their Face .] The Plot comprehends the greatest part of the Tragedy, for it generally takes in the four first Acts, and sometimes the greatest part of the fifth; in a word, it lasts so long that the Spectator is in suspence concerning the issue of his Heroes designs, and the Obstacles which hinder him. In Mr. Racine's Iphigenia , and Phedra , as in the Hippolytus and Iphigenia of Euripides , the Plot holds till the last Scene, where the Unravelling is made: and this is much finer than where the Plot goes no farther than the middle of the fourth Act; for then 'tis very difficult, if not impossible, to keep the rest from being dull and flat. 3\. I call the Unravelling, all that is from that change to the end .] The Unravelling begins when all the Obstacles cease, and the doubts are cleared up; and it ought to be a necessary or a probable consequence, of all that preceded, and the shorter and quicker turn it has, 'twill be the more agreeable, provided it be not precipitate and deficient as Aristophanes speaks of the Catastrophe. 4\. For Example, in the Lynceus of Theodectes, all that happens before the taking that young Prince, is the Plot, and the Unravelling begins at the place, where the Child complains of his Death ,  &c.] You may see what has been said concerning the Subject of this piece, in the XII. Chapter; 'tis probable, that those lamentations which Lynceus made, on his dying, stirred up the People, and caused a Sedition, by which that Prince's Life was saved, and Danaus destroyed. 5\. We have said that Tragedy has four parts, there are also four sorts of Tragedy .] This Article is perhaps the most difficult in the whole Art of Poetry. I should be too tedious to repeat all which has been said on it to no purpose, and shall therefore deliver only my own Sentiments. Aristotle lays it down as a fundamental, that Tragedy has four principal parts of Quality. The Subject , the Manners , the Sentiments and the Diction : for I don't count here either the Decoration or the Musick. To these four parts he added, the Recognizance , the Peripetic and the Passion ; but of these seven, there are only three which are common to all Tragedies in general; the Subject , the Sentiments and the Diction . There remain four, viz . the Peripetie , the Recognizance , the Passion , and the Manners , and these four produce the four sorts of Tragedy which Aristotle here speaks of; That which hath a Peripetie and Remembrance is the implex Tragedy; as Oedipus, Electra, Iphigenia Taurica . That which hath neither of them, is the simple Tragedy, which exposes the Subject as it goes on, with a simple Plot and a simple Unravelling; as the Prometheus of Æ schylus , the Phorcydes and all those pieces which are made about the Stories of the Infernal Regions. These are the two principal sorts of Tragedy, which are again each of them divided into two, for they may be either Pathetick or Moral. Aristotle calls those pieces where there is Passion, Pathetick ; that is, where there are Deaths, Wounds, Torments, & c . the Ajax of Sophocles is Simple and Pathetick, and his Oedipus Implex and Pathetick at the same time. To conclude, the Moral Tragedy is that which whether it be Implex or Simple, doth not expose Deaths, Wounds or Torments: but on the contrary, the happiness of some Persons, who are commendable for their virtue. The Ion of Euripides , seems to me to be an Implex and Moral piece. This is all I have to say on this passage, which was certainly very obscure. 6\. As Ajax, and Ixion.] He says Ajax and Ixion in the Plural Number, because there were a great many pieces on those Subjects. The Ajax of Sophocles is Simple and Pathetick. 7\. The third is the Moral, as the Phthiotides and Peleus.] The Moral Tragedy, is that which is made to reform the Manners, and always ends with a happy Catastrophe, it may be as the Pathetick, either Implex or Simple. We know neither the Subject of the Phthiotides , nor Peleus , for those Tragedies have been lost a long time. 'Tis probable, that the Phthiotides were Maidens whose Vertue preserved them from some eminent danger. As for Peleus we know, that the Wife of Acastus , being unable to oblige him to answer her Passion, would take him off, and to that end, accuses him to her Husband, of attempting to force her. Acastus , to revenge that Affront, exposes Peleus to the wild Beasts on the Mountain Pelion ; but Jupiter , who is the Protector of Innocence, sent him a Sword by Vulcan or Chiron , with which he delivered himself, and became Master of Acastus's Kingdom. The Gods delivered him from many other Dangers, and married him to Thetis . And 'tis on this change of Fortune, that Pindar says in the third Ode of his Pythonicks. ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , ![](/images/inline/THgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Xgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ὖ ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) If any has an upright Heart, 'tis he, Shall be made blest with all Felicity. 8\. To conclude, the fourth, as the Phorcydes, Prometheus.] That which caused a very great difficulty in this passage, was, that Aristotle has not put the name to this fourth sort of Tragedy, or 'tis lost, but 'tis easy to supply it from the XXVI Chapter, where the Philosopher says expressly, that there are as many sorts of Epopoeia, as Tragedy, and names these four, the Implex , the Simple , the Moral , and the Pathetick . Therefore this last, which is not named here, must be the Simple , since he names the other three, and we need only look on the pieces he quotes, to be convinced of this. We have Æ schylus's Prometheus , which is without doubt a Simple Tragedy, for it only shews Prometheus's sufferings without any Remembrance or Peripetie: 'Tis Simple and Pathetick. 9\. As the Phorcydes.] The Phorcydes were three Sisters, Daughters of Phorcys , who was Son of the Ocean and the Earth : they were old from their Birth, and had only one Eye among them, which they used in their turns. They dwelt under ground, in the extreme parts of Scythia. Æschylus made a Tragedy on these fine Ladies, for as Aristotle took notice in another place, the Poets made Tragedies on any sort of Subjects. Probably Æ schylus brought in the Story of Perseus who went to steal their Eye away from them, that he might find out the way which led to certain Nymphs, who had Claws, which he had occasion to make use of against the Gorgons. 10\. And all that is transacted in Hell .] That is to say, and all the Tragedies which treat of those Subjects, whose Stories are taken from Hell, for the Antients brought on their Stages, the punishments of those who were tormented there; so Æ schylus made a Tragedy of Silyphus roling his Stone. There is a very notable passage of Lucian on this in his Treatise of Dancing; where he says that a Buffoon, a Dancing Master, ought to know all the Subjects of the Tragedies of Hell, the punishments of the wicked, and the causes of those punishments: The friendships of Theseus and Pirithous, which was preserved even there. To conclude, all that Homer, Hesiod, and the other Poets have invented, but chiefly the Tragick. 11\. We should endeavour to succeed in all these four sorts, or at least, in the greatest part of them, and the most important.] Aristotle does not say that a Poet ought to gather all these four sorts, into one Tragedy, for that would not have done well; for can a Tragedy be at the same time both implex, and simple? But he says, that a Poet should endeavour, to make good Tragedies, in every one of these kinds, or at least in most of them, and the most important. That is in the implex, Moral, and Pathetick. I know that one Tragedy may have all these qualifications, and be implex, Moral, and Pathetick; but 'tis likely that one of these qualities will predominate over the rest, and give it its name. Aristotle speaks here of Tragedies, in which one of these qualities principally reigns. 12\. And especially now, when every one pretends to Criticize on the Poets .] This place teaches us, that the Athenians , who being spoiled, by the fine pieces, they had of Æ lchylus, Sophocles , and Euripides , who were excellent Poets in their several ways, were so nice and delicate, that they wanted a Poet equal to them all. Aristotle complains, of this Injustice, not in that nature, for he uses a term, which I have translated Criticize , which signifies to accuse wrongfully: Litigiously to find fault with , ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  notwithstanding which, he advises the Poets, to endeavour their satisfaction, and certainly when all that is required of a Poet, is a greater perfection, he ought to use his utmost endeavours to attain it: we are not so unjust as the Athenians , but are well satisfied if those who write now, come near Mr. Corneille , or Mr. Racine , and never expect that any one, should surpass those two in their ways. We are more modest in our desires. 13\. For because there have been excellent Men in every one of those kinds .] Those who were excellent in these kinds were Æ schylus, Sophocles and Euripides , who as Cicero well observes, are all very different, and yet very excellent. The entire Passage in his third Book of an Orator is as follows. Una fingendi est ars, in qua pr aestantes fuerunt Myro, Polycletes, Lys[illeg.]ppus, qui omncs inter se dissimiles fuerunt, sed it a tamen, ut neminem sui velis esse dissimilem. Una est ars, ratioque picture dissimillimi tamen inter se Zeuxis, Apelles, Aglaophon, neque eorum quisquam est, cui quidquam in sua arte deesse videtur. Et si hoc in his quoque mutis artibus est mirandum, & tamen veram; quanto admirabilius in Oratione & Lingua, quae cum in iisdem verbis sentintiisque versetur, Summas habet dissimilitudines? non sic ut alii viluperandi sutt, sed ut ii, quos constat esse laudandos, in disuari genere laudantur. Idque primum in Poetis rerni licet, quam inter se Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, dissimiles sint; quanquan omnibus par pene laus in dissimili Scribendi genere tribuatar. There is but one Art of Sculpture, in which Myro, Polycletes, and Lysippus, were excellent, altho' differing one from another, but so, that none would have had any of them to have been otherwise, than what he was. There is but one Art and Reason of Painting; Yet Zeuxis, Apelles, and Aglaophon, were very unlike one another, yet none seems to have wanted any thing, that was ne essary to his Art. Though this is to be admired in these mute Arts, 'tis however true. How much more wonderful is it then, to find the same Differences in Discourse, which uses the same Words and Thoughts not that any are to be blamed; but that those who are praise-worthy deserve it in their several kinds. And this is chiefly discernable in the Poets; how different are Æschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles from one another and yet they all deserve equal praise in their differing ways of Writing . These three Poets are different in their Style, and I hope none will take it amiss, that I speak of it now, (though 'tis not what properly belongs to this place) as Dionysius Halicarnasseus has explained it in his excellent Treatise of the Composition or placing of Words. That Author shews us, that there are three Differences, which distinguish all Writers of what Nature soever. The first is the Character, which he calls Rough , that is rude and neglected, which has less of Art, than Nature, and where the Passions are better noted, than the Manners. This is the Character of Æ [illeg.]schylus for a Tragedian; Pindar for a Lyrick Poet : and Thusydides for an Historian . The second Character is that which he calls Smooth and Florid , when there is nothing, that grates the Ear, nothing that is rude, bombast , or out of place, where Art hides Nature, and the Manners are better described, than the Passions. This is the Character of Euripides, Hesiod, Anacreon , and Isocrates . The third is that, which is called the Mean , because it is in the Middle between the other two, and is composed of the best of both of them. This Character is the more estimable, because 'tis the most fruitful, and 'tis that of Sophocles, Herodotus, Demosthenes, Aristotle , and Plato . But Homer is the Original of all these. There is no place in his Poems, where the Mixture of these Characters does not give a wonderful Pleasure. Those Writers who have imitated him, are admirable, when taken alone, but compared with Homer , fall infinitely short of him. But to return to our Passage, if these three Poets Æ schylus, Sophocles , and Euripides are different in their Style and Composition, they are not less to in the Manner of their limitation, and by the Quality of their Pieces, as Aristotle here assures us. 'Tis to be wish'd, that he wou'd have explained this Difference. He thought without doubt, that 'twould be needless, since 'twas sufficiently known in his time; But as at present we are entirely Ignorant of it, I hope all will be pleased at my Endeavours, to supply what he should have said. Æ schylus, Sophocles , and Euripides have all of them made these four sorts of Tragedies, and each of them excelled in one kind only. The Question than is, to find out, in what sort each of them th[illeg.]n was particularly Eminent. I fancy that Æ schylus is not so good for the Implex pieces, that is, those which have both a Peripetie, and Remembrance, not for the Moral , which simply expose to view the Happiness of some Person, as for the Simple Pathetick , that is, for those, which show dismal Catastrophes, with a continual Coherence. For example, his Prometheous and his seven Captains against Thebes , are in my Judgment, finer than his Agamemnon , and his Coephores . The Remembrance in that last piece is so bad, that Euripides cou'd not forbear jering him, and hath abused the Gravity of the Theatre, by those Satyrical Jests, which he hath used against the Coephores , in his Electra . We must confess, that Tragedy, but beginning then, to arise from its Chaos and Confusion, he could not succeed so well, in those Implex pieces, which are the most difficult in all the Art. On the contrary, Euripides did certainly succeed much better in these, but that was not his Excellence; he was much better for the Moral ones, where he mix'd the Passions admirably well. Sophocles excelled them all in the Implex; so that we may easily determine, that Sophocles is greater than Euripides , and Æ schylus : that Euripides is next to Sophocles , and that Æ schylus is the last. This is what I have to say, concerning the Difference between these three great Poets, as 'twas in Aristotles time. Perhaps I may be deceived; for 'tis no easy Matter, to decide this rightly. I shall be very much obliged to any one, that will give a better Account of these different Characters, and free me from my Error. 14\. It seems to me unjust to say, that a piece is the same with, or different from another, because the Subject is the same, or different. In my Opinion 'twould be more reasonable, to say that, of pieces, whose Plot and marvelling are the same or differen .] I have enlarg'd Aristotles Thought, to render it intelligible. I have also added one Word, which was necessary, and wanting; for I read it, ὧ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἢ ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ἢ ἂ ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif)  . Aristotle condemns here another piece of Injustice in the Athenians ; who believing that the pieces were alike, when the Subject was the same and that they were different, when the Subjects were different, did not relish those pieces, which were made on those Subjects, which had been treated of before: Therefore the Philosopher endeavours, to remove that unjust Prejudice, by telling them, that they must not look on the Subjects of the pieces to know whether they were alike or no, but mind the Plot, and the Unravelling; for two pieces, tho' on different Subjects, may be alike it tho' the Plot, and Unravelling of those two pieces be the same. Æ schylus, Euripides , and Sophocles , all three wrote of the Death of Egysthes and Clytemnestra ; but we cannot say, but that they are three different pieces, because there is neither the same Plot, nor the same Unravelling. And to say something that comes nearer to our selves, Sophocles , and Mr. Corneille have both wrote of Oedipus , 'tis the same Subject, and yet they are very different Plays. Mr. Racine has brought Hippolytus , and Iphigenia on the Stage after Euripides . He hath also furnished his Pieces with all the beauties of the Greek ones, and hath followed a Conduct not very different from that Author; nevertheless the Plays are different, because they have not the same Plot, and the way of Unravelling it. Chrysippus made a Medea after Euripides , and pretends that 'tis the better of the two, because the other had not given that Disposition to the Subject, which it ought to have. We should now give some Examples of pieces, which are alike, though they are made in different Subjects, because the Plot, & c . is the same. I don't know, if there are any such among those of the Ancients, which remain; but I don't remember that I have met with Plots; which have been alike; but 'tis common to find Unravellings, which are so; for these which are made by Machines are almost all the same. The Examples of Pieces, which are alike although different in their, Subjects are very scarce on our Stage, and this no doubt proceeds from the Dulness of our Poets, who not having the Power to invent new Plots and Unravellings, fall into a servile Imitation, and use only those which have been in Plays already acted. It may also happen, because Love generally bears a great Sway in our Pieces; so that 'tis impossible to avoid the same Intrigues. 15\. Most of the Poets, after they have laid the Plot well, Unravel it very ill; but they ought to succeed in one, as well as the other .] This Judgment of Aristotle is very remarkable. The Poets miscarry oftener in the Unravelling, than in the Plot, whether the Unravelling be harder to manage, because 'tis more tyed up, and ought to arise from what went before; or whether the Poet be tyred of his Work, and begins to grow dull and lazy. We have very few Tragedies, in which, the last Act is not the worst, though if any part ought to be better wrought, than another 'tis that; for 'tis that which makes the last Impression on the Minds of the Audience, and either makes them praise, or blame the Poet. Illic enim , says Cicero in his Book of Old Age, debet toto animo a Poeta in dissolutionem nodi agi; eaque pr aecipua fabulae pars est, quae requirit plurimum diligentiae. The Poet ought to employ all his Ingenuity, in the Unravelling the Plot; for that is the part of the Fable, which requires the greatest Care. Aristotle only says, that they ought to succeed in the Unravelling, as well as in the Plot, and to use his own Terms, that both of them be applauded , that is to say, that they merit Applause. He says nothing here of the Vices in the Unravelling, 'tis not a proper place; he spake sufficiently of this Matter, when he treated of the Unity of the Action, and how the Subject ought to be constituted; for the Unravelling is often Vitious, because 'tis not well prepared, and doth not proceed from the Bottom of the Fable, or because 'tis too long, and embarrassed; or because 'tis obscure; or lastly, because 'tis double. We have Examples of all these Defects in some of our pieces; but they are so visible, that there is no need of exposing them. Before I leave this place, I think my self obliged to take Notice, that some have given another Sense to these Words of Aristotle , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , for instead of translating it as I do, They must be both applauded, they pretend that Aristotle means they must be both close . That is, that the Unravelling follow the Intrigue very close. But besides its not being Greek in that Sense, I don't think that he meant so. Aristotle does not intend to teach us here, that nothing forreign or needless should come between the Plot, and the Unravelling, that he has done elsewhere. And to explain it so, is wrong. Neither would he tell us, that we should not be long in Expectation of the Unravelling; On the contrary the farther 'tis removed the better, and that which comes at the end in the last Scene. I did once believe indeed, that Aristotle would have the Catastrophe begin as soon as possible, so that from the very first Scene we might expect the Unravelling to follow. This is one of the great Secrets of Dramatick and Epick Poem. But when I considered this Passage a little more nicely, I found, that that could not be the Meaning; for he would not have spoke in such an Obscure and equivocal Manner. He only says here, that the Unravelling is always more difficult to form, than the Plot. And to rouse up the lazy Poets, He tells them, that they ought to succeed in both, that is, that a Tragedy which shall have the finest Plot in the World, will be spoiled, if the Plot be not well Unravelled. 16\. Above all, they should remember very well, as has been often said already, not to make a Tragedy with an Epick Complication. I call an Epick Complication a Complication of several Fables; as if all that Iliad should be put into one Tragedy.] Aristotle has told us very often, that the Action, which makes the Subject of a Tragedy, ought to be one, and that the Unity of the Action must be preserved, not only in the first Plan of the Fable, but also in the Fable, when it is extended, and amplified by the Episodes , which ought also to be Parts and Members of the same Action: And as the same Rule extends its self to Epick Poem, which ought to be one and single, the Philosopher had great Reason to fear, least the Poets should fall into this Error, and that they should be perswaded, that provided they kept the Unity of the Action in Tragedy, they might put in as many Parts and Fables, as in an Epick Poem. This is what he would prevent, both by Reason and Examples. 'Tis from this Text, and that of the eleventh Remark, that Horace has taken the Subject of those five Verses in his Art of Poetry. Publica Materies privati juris erit, si Nec circa vilem, patulumque moraberis orbem, Nec verbum verbo curari reddere, fidus Interpres, nec desilies imitator in arctum, Unde pedem referre vetat pudor, aut aperis lex. A publick Theme will then your own become, If you your Author follow not too home, Not bound him Word by Word nicely to trace, So straightned up, you cannot add a grace, If you are thus oblig'd to follow close, Your Imitation will its Beauty lose. 17\. In Epick Poem every part receives its Just Magnitude, by reason of the Length of the Poem: but it happens quite otherwise in Tragedy, then was expected .] This is the Reason, why that Multiplicity of Fables, which is receiv'd in an Epick Poem, is Vitious in Tragedy, because the Length of an Epick Poem gives the Poet an Opportunity of letting all the parts of it have their Just Magnitude; Whereas Tragedy, which is an Action contained in a short Space, doth not allow him that Liberty: insomuch that if he would transfer the Fables of an Epick Poem into a Tragedy, instead of making a body, whose Members would be proportionable, not one of them would have its Just Magnitude. Aristotle hath said already, That the Episodes of a Tragedy are short, but that Epopoeia, is extended and amplified by those, which belong to it : If Tragedy can admit only of short Episodes, by Reason of its Brevity, how can it suffer such a Number of Episodes, as are necessary for an Epick Poem? We see by this, and 'tis manifest, that a Tragedy is not only Vitious, when it is Episodical, that is, when it hath Episodes, which are not well united with the principal Action, but also, when it has too many, how proper soever they may be. 18\. And we may be convinced of this Truth by the ill Success of those, who have put (for Example) all the Destruction of Troy into one piece, and not managed that Subject in parts .] After the Reason; the Example which confirms it, follows: and 'tis taken from those, who having made an Epick Complication of a Tragedy, had no success. Many Poets, who made Tragedies on the Taking of Troy , were guilty of this Fault; they put all the Particularities of that Seige into their Pieces, of which any one was sufficient to have made an entire and perfect Tragedy. 19\. As Euripides treated his Niobe, or his Medea, or as Æschylus.] The Interpreters pretend, that Aristotle blames one of these Poets, and praises the other, and quarrel, only to know, on which of these two the Praise or the Blame ought to fall. But to reconcile them, I shall shew, that he praises both, and that they who thought otherwise were mistaken, by not taking Notice of the Words, which he uses. That ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) &sbohacgr; ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , and not as Æschylus , is only a Sequel and Repetition of the first ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif)  , not ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ὥ ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  and not by parts as Euripides, which is as if he had said, and not by parts as Euripides, and not by parts as Æschylus. Æ schylus and Euripides both, made a Medea , and a Niobe . Of all those Pieces, we have only Euripides his Medea , where that Poet is very far from putting all the History of that Princess into his Piece, that he uses only one part, which is the Revenge she takes of Jason for his Infidelity. He us'd the same Conduct in his Niobe , and we have no Reason to doubt, but that Æ schylus had the same Prudence; for those pieces of his, which remain are not chargeable with this Fault. The Reproach, which he lays under, of making Niobe remain three whole Days on her Childrens Tomb, without speaking a Word, is grounded on a false Writing of Suidas's Text, where he transcrib'd Æ schylus's Life read, ἕ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , to the third Day , instead of ἕ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  : To the third part of the Tragedy: that is, till the third Act ; which is evidently justified by the Criticism, which Aristophanes makes on that piece in his Furies , where he makes Euripides say, That Æ schylus , to amuse the Audience, with an Expectation of Niobe's Speaking, kept her silent till the middle of the Play; and after that, the Play being in the middle , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ἤ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif)  , that is, the Play being in the third Act, Niobe brake silence with a dozen hard Words, that none of the Audience could understood. If Æ schylus had introduced a Multiplicity of Fables into that piece, no doubt, but Aristophanes would have found Fault with him for it. Aristotle says then, that those, who make Tragedies on the Taking of Troy , ought to treat of that Subject in parts, not altogether, and imitate the Prudence of Euripides , and Æ schylus , who in composing their Medea , and Niobe , did not put in all their Misfortunes, but one part of them only. 20\. For they either saw their Pieces damn'd; or were overcome .] They either saw their Pieces damn'd, when they were acted before the People; or they were overcome when these Pieces were play'd before the Judges. Aristotle puts in this Alternative, because sometimes those Pieces, which were condemned by the Judges, had very good Success before the People, but they were not the better for that; for though they were the most knowing, and delicate People in the World, yet they might be deceived. The Orestes of Euripides was one of his Pieces, which succeeded the best in the Representation, though it had been condemned at the Examen with good Reason too, because of the Manners which are Vitious without any Necessity, and the Catastrophe, which is naught. 21\. And this was the only Cause of Agathons Misfortune.] Agathon , had several times won the Prize of Tragedy, and was also oftentimes overcome, but that was no oftener than he trespassed against this Rule. 22\. For otherwise all these Poets are wonderful in their Peripeties, and simple Unravellings .] That is, Agathon , and all those Poets who made Tragedies on the Taking of Troy: Aristotle says, that all those Poets were admirable in the Unravellings of those Pieces, which were overcome; and 'tis remarkable; that one or two good parts in a Play were not sufficient to make it pass. In the Peripeties , that is, in the Catastrophe of the Implex Pieces; and in the simple Unravellings , that is, in the Catastrophe of the simple Pieces, which had neither Peripetie nor Remembrance. All the Tragedies, which were made on the Taking of Troy , must be simple Pieces. 23\. Which are Tragical, and cause abundance of Pleasure .] He says, that the Unravelling of those simple Pieces, although they have no Peripetie, that is, change of Fortune into good or bad, are yet Tragical, and please, we may judge of this, by the Prometheus of Æ schylus , and the Ajax , of Sophocles , which are simple Pieces; and although the Misfortune of those two Persons be continued from the beginning to the end of the piece; yet the Unravelling interesses us, and is also Tragical, and agreeable. 24\. For the Tragical, and agreeable, are found together, (for example) when we see a Wise Man, but Wicked, who is deceived, as a Sisyphus, or a valiant but unjust Man that is conquered .] What he says of the Subjects, of simple Pieces being agreeable, and Tragical, seems to contradict, what he had advanc'd in the XVI. Chapter, that the Misfortunes of a wicked Man should not be expos'd on the Stage. He gives the Reason, why the Tragical and Agreeable are found in these Subjects, which is, because the Wickedness of those Men, who were the Subjects of these Plays, was accompanied with some Qualities, which made them seem, as if they should not have fallen into such Miseries, as befell them. For Example, Sisyphus , one of the Heroes of these simple Pieces, was wise, that is, so crafty and cunning, that the Ancients said, he was the most subtile of all Men . It seems then, that he ought to have used that Cunning and Ingenuity, to prevent himself from being deceived, and to commit such Faults, as caused him to be condemned, to rowl a Stone to the Top of a Mountain, which was always running down again. Nevertheless, as the Wisdom of Men is but folly, he was taken in the Snares; and we are both astonished and ravished at the same time; 'tis exactly the same of an unjust Man; for we see with the same Affections, that his Courage did not save him, but these Subjects must never be used, but in the simple Pieces, because they are rather bad, than good. In the implex Pieces, that is, in the finest, and most regular, none are admitted, but these Persons, who are neither Good, nor Wicked, or who are rather Good, than Wicked. If any other are introduced, they are secondary Persons, as we have said in another place; this Passage deserv'd to be explained. 25\. All this is probable .] As a Dramatick Poem is always founded on Probability, and would rather admit of a Lye, that was probable, than a Truth, which was not so. Aristotle prevents an Objection, which might be made, that 'tis improbable, the most Cunning of all Mankind should be deceiv'd, and a very valiant Man conquer'd. He says, 'tis not absolutely probable, but only in a certain manner, insomuch as it doth not directly shock the verisimilitude, and appears not to be manifestly false. 26\. For as Agathon says .] There are in the Probability several things, which happen contrary to the Probability. Aristotle in his Rhetorick quotes this Passage of Agathon's. ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , ![](/images/inline/bgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  . Though many things fall out, which seem to be True; yet, the offend 'gainst Probability. But Dramatick Poem requires the Common and ordinary sort of Probability. And I would not advise the Tragick Poets to venture at many extraordinary things on this Maxim of Agathon's . The two Subjects, he here speaks of, may be true in another respect. The most valiant Men are sometimes conquered, and the Craftiest taken in their own Cunning. 27\. The Chorus must also take the part of an Actor, so that it make one part of the whole, and contribute to the Advancement of the Action .] As a Tragedy is the Representation of a publick and visible Action, which is done by Illustrious Persons, and of high Rank, 'tis impossible, that the Action should pass in publick, without more Persons than the Actors, whose Interest is concern'd, and whose Fortune depends on that of the chief Persons: These are those, who compose the Chorus , the Spectators of the Action, but interessed Spectators, and we may assert, that the Chorus lays the Foundation of the Probability of the Tragedy. I don't wonder, that we omit it; for without taking any Notice of the Unity of Place, which the Chorus requires, we can hardly preserve the Actions, which make the Subject of our Tragedies, they are not the most part visible Actions, but transacted in Chambers and Closets. How can the Chorus enter there, to be Witness of these Actions, which are rather secret, than publick. The Chorus would not only be needless, and incommodious there, but also improbable. The Mischief is, that the Spectators can enter no more, than the Chorus; and 'tis not a little unnatural, the Citizens should see all, that is transacted in the Cabinets of Princes, though the Occasions of the Prince must necessarily require some People to be about him. If we would open our Eyes, and make Use of our Reason, we should find the Necessity of avoiding this Error, and in spite of Custom re-establish the Chorus, which is only capable of restoring Tragedy to its first Lustre, and obliging the Poets to a more exact Choice of those Actions, which they take for their Subjects. Wee'll explain Aristotles Text, and shew what was the Business of the Chorus. By what has been already said, 'tis easy to perceive, that the Chorus made one part of the whole, since it was interessed in the Action. Making thus one part of the whole, it could not be dumb in the Course of the Acts, but if all the Chorus spoke together, 'twould have made an horrible Confusion on the Stage, and been a breach of good Manners towards the principal Persons; 'tis for this Reason, that the first Person of the Chorus, who was called the Corypheus , spoke for them all, and as Aristotle says, play'd the part of an Actor . Which Horace has explain'd in his Art of Poetry thus. Actoris Partes Chorus, officiumque virile Defendat. The Chorus too must act a noble part. The second Duty of the Chorus was to show by its Singing, the Intervals of the Acts. This was its proper Office, and to which 'twas particularly destined; for is it natural that those who were interessed in the Action, and expected the Issue with Impatience, should stand with their Arms across, and say nothing, while the Necessity of the Action obliged the Actors to be off the Stage? Is it not reasonable, that these People should entertain themselves with what was past, and talk of that, which they either feared or hoped for? This was the Matter of the Songs of the Chorus, during the Intermedes, and there Aristotle very aptly says, that the Chorus ought to sing nothing but what is agreeable to the Subject, and concurrs to the Advancement of the Action, or to use: Aristotles own Words; they ought to work with the others ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , and tend to the same end , and thus Horace has very well translated. \--- Neu quid medios intercinat actus, Quid non proposito conducat, & haereat apte. For nothing we between the Acts should see But with the Play exactly will agree. Such was the Conduct of the Ancients in all their Tragedies. The Chorus and the Actors both advanc'd the same Action; and consequently there was nothing in that Poem, but what was natural, and probable. When I consider, that we have Violins, & c . instead of the Chorus, and when we are in a great Concern, what will become of Oedipus, Cinna, Iphigenia, Phedra , instead of Understanding something, that agrees with the Subject, and leads us to the Catastrophe, whilst it gives us Pleasure, we hear nothing but Airs of the Violin, I am astonished at our Fancy; but Mr. Corneille says, The Songs of the Chorus don't give the Audience time to breath, whereas the Violins are of extraordinary great Use; for the Minds of the Spectators are as it were unbent, whilst they play, and reflect on, what they have seen, either to praise or blame, according as it hath pleas'd or displeas'd them. The time that they play is so short, that the Ideas are still fresh so that when the Actors re-enter, there is no Trouble to revive them, and recal their Attention . This great Man should have endeavour'd to make those believe this, who have no Knowledge of the Theatre. A Tragedy is divided into five Parts, to give to the Audience four Opportunities, to consider whether they shall applaud, or condemn, what they have seen. Such a Tragick Action is very commodious, quiet, and well allotted, and the Actors well satisfied to rest in the height of their Passions, to give us time to rest, and to condemn or approve of what they do; but how does the first Act coher to the second, the second to the third when such a forreign thing, as airs for the Violins, separate them? And what is it, that shall oblige me to tarry in my place till the Actors come in again? They tell me they will re-enter. Oh! but will they always re-enter. 'Tis the Custom; a very pleasant sort of Security! but he that sees a Tragedy for the first time, is he instructed in this Custom? He must enquire of his Neighbour, and he will inform him. Besides, in a Tragick Action which either does or ought to interest us, is it natural that we should seek these strange ways of rest? Is there any Person in the World, who has Patience enough, to give Attention three or four Hours to see a Tragick Adventure, when it is managed according to the Rules of Art, and mixt with those things, which will render it, agreeable and affecting! This is not sought with an urgent Desire; In a Word whilst the Violins thus separate the Acts, Tragedy can never be one and the same Body. People may imagine and fancy, what they please, but Imagination will not make Amends for the Deviation from the Rules of Art. 28\. As in Sophocles, and not as in Euripides.] Aristotle found that the Chorus's of Sophocles agreed with the Subject of the Tragedy, and made with the Acts one and the same whole; on the contrary those of Euripides were entirely separated from the Actions, and agreed no more with that, then any other, you would apply them to. This Judgment is true; we need only take the first Piece of Euripides , and examine the Chorus, which makes the first interval. In the first Act Polydorus , whose Throat was cut by Polymnestor , appears by Night in a Dream to Hecuba , and relates his hard Fortune. Hecuba frightned by the Vision, and the Dream, which she had seen, was in pain for her Daughter Polyxena , rose to go to Agamemnon's Tent, to find Cassandra . On this the Chorus enters, which is made up of Phrygian Slaves, who tell us, that the Greeks had resolved to sacrifice Polyxena on Achilles's Tomb. That unhappy Queen calls her Daughter, to tell her that horrible News. After some tender Complaints between these two Ulysses comes to fetch the Victim, and notwithstanding all the Queen's Entreaties, snatches her from her Arms, and carries her away. Hecuba falls into a Swound in her Womens Arms, who carry her off, and thus ends the first Act. What does the Chorus upon this? Why, instead of singing Things agreeable to the Subject, the Women who compose it, amuse themselves by demanding of the Winds. Where will ye carry us? Shall we go to be Slaves in Doris, or Thessaly: or where Eridanus fattens the Earth? Shall it be to Delos, where the first Lawrel and Palmtree extended their Branches, to aid Latona in the time of her Childbirth? Wee'l employ our selves , say they, to praise the fine Dress and Featuras of Diana? Shall it be in Athens, where Minerva hath a Throne of Gold; and where in the finest Silk wee'l work on the mysterious Tapistry, the Chariot of that Goddess, and the History of the Titans, who were Thunder-struck by Jupiter? and end, by the unhappy State of themselves and their Country. 'Tis easy to perceive, that this Chorus is not drawn from the Subject, as also that 'tis not proper; for there is nothing in it, but may be tranferr'd into any other Piece, where the Chorus is composed of captive and strange Women. Sophocles doth not so; we will take his first Piece also, that we may not seem to be prejudiced. In the first Act of Ajax we see Minerva , who informs Ulysses , that 'twas Ajax , who in a mad Fit fell on the Grecian Troops in the Night, and made an horrible Slaughter, thinking to kill Agamemnon, Menelaus and Ulysses . At the same time she causes Ajax to enter, who discourses with that Goddess of the Vengeance, he had taken of his Enemies, and the Mischief he had prepared for Ulysses . After which he goes to his Tent; Ulysses and Minerva retire. During these things the Chorus enters, (which is composed of Salaminians, Ajax's Subjects) to inform their Prince of the ill Report, which was spread abroad concerning him, and of which they thought Ulysses was the Author, and they also entreated him, that he would suppress it, by his Presence, and after they had taken Possession of the Stage, they sang this, which makes the first Intermede. Powerful Fame, who art the Author of our Disgrace, what Reports have you spread abroad against our Princes? Is it not Diana, O Ajax, who excited you against those Troops? Because you have offended her by not thanking her for the Victory she had given you, or in neglecting to consecrate some Honourable Spoils, or to conclude in depriving her of part of the Prey after some happy Chase? It may be Bellona, or Mars, who not having receiv'd the first Fruits of your Spoils, would revenge the Affront, in hurrying you on to commit these Excesses during that Cloud. O Son of Telamon, you would never have committed such a horrid Action in your right Senses; the Gods dispose of our Reason as they please, and according to their Inclinations send us such Distempers; No , Jupiter and Apollo Scatter these injurious Reports. If our Kings are surprized at these Relations, what will those Apostates be, who are descended from the unhappy Sisyphus. In the Name of the Gods O Prince! don't give way to these Calumnies by keeping your self thus shut up. Come out of your Tent, where your stubborn Humour has kept you so long unprofitably, and where you only encrease our Uneasinesses. In the mean while your Enemies Triumph, nothing hinders the Reproaches of their envenomed Tongues, and we are overwhelmed with Grief . All this is drawn from the Subject, and concurrs with the rest, to the Advancement of the Action, and there is none, but is touch'd with it. To say that the Airs for the Violin, a Sarabrand, or a Chacoon will have the same Effect, as this Chorus of Sophocles , if well set to Musick, can never be asserted by any one that is neither mad nor blind. 29\. In all the other Poets 'tis yet worse; for the Chorus's belong no more to the Subject they treat off, than to any other Tragedy; 'tis for this Reason, that they sing Songs, which are inserted without any Relation .] This is a very remarkable Criticism, since it extends to all the Poets of Aristotles time. There was not one of them, who knew how to accommodate the Chorus's to the Subjects. 'Twas worse, than in Euripides ; they were so easy in the Matter, that they had in the Chorus's only inserted Songs, That is to say, Songs, which the Poets took either from other Pieces, or any where else and inserted them into their Tragedies. 30\. Agathon was the First, who introduced this Male Practice.] Agathon , to save the Trouble of making the Chorus's found out this nice way, to take any Songs, where he could get them, and to insert them in the Intervals of his Pieces, as if we should take Songs from the Opera, to make the Intermedes of the Cid, Andromache , and Phedra. 31\. However what Difference is there, between singing such Adventitious Songs, and transperting any long Discourse, or Episode entirely, from one Piece to another.] Aristotle could not describe the foreign Chorus's better, than by saying, that a Poet might as well transfer long Recitations, or whole Episodes from one Play to another; for Example, suppose he should transport an Episode of Andromache into Phedra , or Hippolytus's Death into Andromache . That Change would not have a worse Effect in those Pieces, than these borrow'd Chorus's; for the Chorus's are as much parts and Members of the Tragedy, as the Episodes and Imitations. If Aristotle so absolutely condemned these strange Chorus's, these inserted Songs which made the Intervals, what would he say to our Violins, which are Ten Thousand times more vitious; for though the Chorus did not sing any thing, which agreed with the Subject, it serv'd at least to link the Acts together, and to keep the continuity of the Action, and by its Presence obliged the Spectator to tarry, to see what would become of that Chorus, which had a share in the Action, during the Course of the Act. Of the Sentiments, and in what they consist. The Reasons, from whence the Poets ought do draw them, as the Orators do. The Difference between those things, which the Orators, and those things which the Poets treat off. Of the Action, which comprehends the Pronunciation, and the Gesture. To whom it belongs to treat of it. A Trifling Criticism of Protagoras on Homer. I. There remain only the Diction, and the Sentiments to be spoken of; for we have sufficiently explained all the other parts of Tragedy . As for the Sentiments, you may see, what has been said in my Books of Rhetorick; for they are properly, what belongs to that Art. The Sentiments is all, that makes the Matter of the Discourse, and  251 they consist in proving, refuting, exciting the Passions, as Pity, Anger, Fear, and all the others, to  252 enhance the Value off, or debase any thing. II. 'Tis evident then, that in the Subjects of Dramatick Poems , the Poets ought to make use of the same Reasons, which the Orators do, when they would make things appear worthy of Pity, or terrible, or great, or probable. III. There is  253 however this Difference between those things, we treat of, that some are naturally such, as we would have them appear, without the Assistance of  254 Art; but others are made such by the Ingenuity of him , who speaks, and who 255 gives by his Words such a Form to them, as they seem to us to have; for what would he have to do, if all things were  256 affecting of themselves without the Help of his Discourses. IV. As for the Diction, there is one part of it, which is for Show and the Stage; that is, the  257 Pronunciation and the Gesture, but that properly Regards the Comedians, or some such like Profession. For 'tis their Business to teach , what a Command, a Petition, and Interrogation, an Answer, and  258 such other like things are. V. And truly  259 whether we observe, or violate these Rules, 'tis nothing to the Poem, which can suffer no reproach on this Account, that is worthy of Consideration. For Example ,  260 I should never allow of Protagoras's Criticism, who accuses Homer , of commanding the Muses, whereas he should have petitioned them, under Pretence , that he uses the Imperative Mood: Muse sing the Anger ,  &c.  261 and his Reason is, that to order any one to do a thing, or not to do it, is a Formal Command. But  262 as the Judgment of this Criticism depends on another Art, and not Poetry, we shall not tarry to examine it. 1\. As for the Sentiments, you may see, what hath been said of them in my Books of Rhetorick, for they are properly what belongs, to that Art  .] As the Passions are the Cause and Source of the Sentiments, and the Sentiments the Matter of the Discourse, 'tis Rhetorick, that ought to lay down Rules, to teach what Expressions ought to be us'd, to excite such or such Sentiments, and the Manner, how it should be done, and this is what Aristotle has show'd in his Books of Rhetorick, of which the first Treats of the Passions, and the third of Elocution. 2\. 'Tis evident then, that in the Subjects of Dramatick Poems, the Poets ought to use the same Forms, the Orators do.] Aristotle calls Forms a certain fund, and Quantity of general or particular Propositions on all the Heads, that belong to these sorts of Rhetorick, and from which they may take all they have Occasion for in the Business they treat off, as out of a common Treasury. And he says very well, that the Poets ought to make Use of these as well, as the Orators, since they treat of the same things, and aim at the same Design; for the Poets endeavour to praise, and blame, to perswade, or disswade, to accuse or defend, as the Orators do, if they would prove, that a thing is Good or Evil; Honest, or Dis-honest; Great or Small; Just or Unjust; of little Importance, or great Consideration. They must then have recourse to the said Forms, whether common or particular, in order to use only proper and necessary Arguments. 3\. There is however this Difference between those things we treat of, that some are naturally such, as we would have them appear, without the Assistance of Art, but others are made such, by the Ingenuity of him, who speaks .] This is the Difference between those things, an Orator, and those, which a Poet treats of. Those, that belong to the Poet are in themselves terrible, and pityful, without the Assistance of Art. The Histories of Oedipus, Ajax, Hecuba , have no need of the Ornaments of Art, to appear terrible, or pityful: besides the Poets chuse their Subjects. The Orators have not the same Priviledge, for they don't chuse theirs. And as they are obliged to speak on all sorts of Subjects, they are very often obliged to change the Forms of the Matters, to make that pass, for pityful and terrible, which is not so, and to palliate and disguise that, which is. Thus they by their Words give such a Face to Affairs, as they seem to us to have. But it oftentimes happens also, that Orators treat of some Subjects, which are naturally such, as they would have them appear. The Poets also manage those, that are quite different, and in which they have Occasion, for all the Colours, they can borrow from Rhetorick; such is the Discourse made by Clytemnestra , in the Electra of Sophocles , to prove, that she did a just Action, in killing her Husband, and had nothing to answer for, in Committing that Murder; but as this seldom happens, it does not destroy the Difference, which Aristotle makes. 4\. For what would he have to do, if all things were affecting of themselves, without the Help of his Discourses .] If all that, which affords Matter to the Orator, was touching in it self, he would have nothing to do; his Art would be superfluous, and all he could say, would been vain; for the most simple Expressions would be the best. Aristotles Expression is well worth taking Notice off. He says properly, if all things are sweet of themselves . The Word Sweet , signifies Touching , and 'tis what Horace has imitated in these Verses of his Art of Poetry. Non satis est pulchra esse poemata, dulcia sunto, Et quecunque volunt, animum auditoris agunto. ' Tis not sufficient Poems should be fine But should the Readers Minds, where e're you please incline. 5\. As for the Diction, there is one part of it, which is for show and the Stage, that is the Pronuntiation and the Gesture, but that properly regards the Comedians, or some such like Profession .] The Diction is divided into two parts, the Elocution and the Action. The Action comprehends the Pronuntiation and the Gesture, but neither of them are the Business of Poetry, or Rhetorick, they belong to a separate Art; these belong to the Comedians, or those, whose province it is to give Rules for it. The Actions of Orators received almost no Improvement in Aristotles time: only one Thrasymachus spake something of it, in a little Treatise, concerning the ways of exciting pity. Not long after Glaucon of Teos , and some other Actors began to lay down Rules for the Theatre and for those, who recited Epick Poems. This proceeded from the preceding Poets acting their own Pieces: and what they did in Respect to the Action, was not as Poets, but as Comedians. Soon after the Poets had quitted the Stage, and given their Plays to the Comedians, those latter had all the Advantage on Account of the Action: and made the Price appear infinitely better, than the Poet could have done. 6\. But that properly regards the Comedians, or some such like Profession.] Quintilian in the XI. Chapter of his first Book explains this Place very well. Debet enim docere Comoedus, quomodo narrandum, qua sit autoritate suadendum, qua concitatione consurgat Ira, qui flexus deceat miserationem ? &c. Et ne illos quidem reprehendendos putem, qui paulum etiam Pal aestricis vacaverint, id nomen est iis, a quibus gestus motusque formantur, ut recta sint brachia, ne indoctae rusticaeve manus, ne status indecorus, ne qua in proferendis pedibus inscitia, ne caput oculique ab alia corpori inclinatione dissideant. A Comedian ought to teach, how we should speak, with what Authority we should perswade, with what Emotion Anger should be raised, and with what Change of Voice we may excite Pity , &c. And I can't blame those, who spend some time with the Masters of the Palestrick Art, that is, those, who Form the Gestures and Motions, teach how to hold the Arms, and the Hands, that we seem not to be rustick, or ignorant, to have no unseemly Carriage, no unbecoming Posture of the Feet, and that the Head and Eyes don't differ from the other Motions of the Body . Thus when Aristotle says, ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , and he, who is of some such like Profession , he speaks of those, whom Quintilian , calls Pal aestricos, Palaestritas , Masters of Exercise, Dancing-Masters, those who dress out for Balls, and Masks; for 'twas these, who formed the Gesture, and taught, how to express the Passions by the Motions of the Body only. 7\. For 'tis their Business to teach, what a Command, a Petition, an Interrogation ,  &c. are .] All the secret of this, as Aristotle says elsewhere, depends on the Voice; for it consists in knowing, how to make Use of every Passion. For Example, when we have Occasion to raise, or fall, or to speak in the ordinary Tone; how we must use the different Tones, as the Acute, Grave, Low, Circumflex, to manage them the better in every particular Movement; for 'tis certain, that those, who study Pronunciation, observe these three things, the Body, the Voice, and the Harmony or Number; but those are not sufficient; 'tis necessary, that the Voice be accompanied with a Decent, and proportionable Gesture. Aristotle said, that the Action was of such Importance, that of all the Orators, who appear in publick, those, who have the best Pronunciation, and speak finest, are generally prefer'd. This is of as great Prevalence now adays, when we don't judge of things as they are, but as they please. But this does not regard the Art of Poetry. 8\. And truly, whether we observe, or violate these Rules, 'tis nothing to the Poem, which can suffer no Reproach, on this Account, that is worthy of Consideration .] The Poet is no ways concern'd, whether a Verse be ill pronounc'd, or accompanied with a bad Gesture, whether a Petition be made as it 'twere a Command, and an Interrogation as an Answer: the Actor only ought to be accused here, as deficient in his Duty. A Poet may also trangress the Rules of Grammar, and all other Arts, and yet the Faults ought not to be imputed to Poesy. They are Foreign, as Aristotle has proved in the XXVI. Chapter, on which see the Remarks. 9\. For Example, I should never allow of Protagoras Criticism, who accuses Homer, of commanding the Muses, whereas he should have petitioned them, under pretence, that he uses the Imperative Mood; Muse sing the Anger .] This Protagoras was a Sophist, all whose Doctrines had a sort of deceitful Probability, and Appearance; though he really said nothing, but what was false, and far distant from the Truth. All the Objections, which he made against Homer , were of this Nature; he accuses him of having spoiled his Poem. For that instead of beginning with an Invocation, he begins with a Command, because he made use of the Imperative. But Grammar informs us, that Imperatives are not always formal Commands, and denote the Superiority of those, who speak. They are very often Prayers, which are made by the Imperative, instead of the Optative, to shew the pressing Necessity, or the greater Confidence; and thus it is that, we speak to God. The Parts of Diction, and their exact Definition. I. The parts of  263 Diction properly speaking are eight 264 Letter, Syllable, Conjunction, Noun, Verb, Article, Case, and Speech. II. A  265 Letter is an indivisible Sound, not of any sort, but  266 articulate, and intelligible, that's to say, of which we understand the Signification. For the Sounds of Beasts are also indivisible, and yet none of them are called  267 Letters. III. The  268 Letters are divided into Vowels, Demi-Vowels, and Mutes. A Vowel is that, which  269 makes an intelligible Sound alone, and without the Help of any other Letter. 270 A Demi-Vowel is that, which  271 borrows the Voice of a Vowel to precede it, that it may be understood, as S. R. The Mute is that, which not being to be understood,  272 with the Addition of some other Letter, which hath a Sound, employs that Letter after it, such are B, G, D. IV. There is yet another Difference between them, which is drawn either from the Conformation of the Mouth, and the other parts, which serve for Pronunciation , or because they are harsh, or sweet; short or long; grave or sharp, or Circumflex  273 . But 'tis proper to treat of the different qualities of Letters in those Treatises only, which teach the Art of Versification. V. A Syllable is a Sound, which signifies nothing, and is composed of a Mute, and a Vowel, for if instead of a Vowel, we put a Demi-Vowel, as G r  274 'tis not a Syllable, neither can it be made one but by adding a Vowel, Gra. But to treat of these Differences belongs to the Art of  275 Verses. VI. Conjunction is a Sound, which signifying nothing by it self , neither causes, nor hinders any of the others, it's join'd with, to have a  276 Signification, but only determines them, to have one only, and which makes one, and the same of all the different Sounds, it unites. 'Tis generally at the end, or in the middle, but sometimes in the beginning  277 or thus: A Conjunction is a Sound, which signifying nothing by it self, and which being join'd with two others , or more, which have their proper Signification, joins them all together , and makes one, and the same thing. 278 An Article is a Sound, which signifying nothing by it self, serves only to show the beginning or end of a Discourse, or  279 to separate one thing from another, as I say, or to this Subject, or, if you please . An Article is a Sound, which signifying nothing by it self, neither makes, nor hinders the rest, from having their Signification; but which determines them, and puts them, either at the beginning or in the middle. 8\. A Noun is a compounded Sound, which signifies something, without denoting the time, and whose compounding parts signify nothing alone, for even in double Nouns every Noun separately has no Signification, as Theodore  280 for if we separate the two Nouns, which Form it, neither of them signify any thing. IX. A Verb is a compounded Sound, which signifies something, and whose parts, when separated, signify no more, than they do in the Nouns. But the Verb has this Advantage of the Noun, that it determines the time, which the Noun doth not. For Example, when I say Man or White. I don't mark any time, but if I say, he goes, or he hath gone,  281 I mark the time present, or past. X. A Case both in Nouns and Verbs; we call a Case or Cadence in Nouns, that which marks the Sequel, or Relation ,  282 as this is of such, and this is to such, and which denotes  283 the Number, as a Man, Men, this is also common to Verbs; but what we call Case in Verbs, is the different Inflexions, according to the Tone and Gesture, as when we ask, or command; as, is he gone? or go you, are the Cases of a Verb according to the different Species. XI. Oration, or a Discourse is a compounded Sound, which signifies something, and  284 whose parts though separated, have their Signification; for 'tis not to be imagined, that a Discourse should be always a Composition of Nouns, and Verbs, as the Definition of a Man. There are Speeches without Verbs, but that does not hinder every one of the separate parts, from having their Signification, as well as this Cleon Walks  285 . XII. An Oration is called one after two Manners, either because it signifies one thing only, or  286 else being compounded of several parts, it makes only one and the same Body, by Reason of the Connexions, which put them together. The Iliad, for Example , is one by Connexion, and the Definition of a Man is one by the Signification of one thing only. 1\. The Parts of Diction properly speaking are Eight  .] Without doubt a great many People will admire, that Aristotele having Occasion to speak of Diction and Elocution, goes back to its first Principles, and accuse him of making a Grammatical Treatise, instead of continuing that of the Art of Poetry. 'Tis necessary to answer that Objection first of all. Both the Grammarian, and the Poet examine the parts of Diction, which are the Foundation of their Arts; but in a very different Manner; the Grammarian examines them in order to speak correctly, and according to Rule; the Poet to render his Discourse more polite, soft, and harmonious, and to imitate more exactly by his Words, the Nature of those things he speaks off, and all this depends on a perfect Knowledge of the first Elements. And those Principles are so much more the Business of Poetry, as the Poets were the first, who improved the Diction; from whence it came to pass, that the Poetick Diction was used by the Orators. Aristotle has then done nothing here, but what was agreeable to his Design, and profitable and necessary in his Language. Dionysius Halicarnasseus in his little Treatise of Composition gives a more particular Account of Letters, Syllables and Words, and discovers the Treasury, from whence the Poets, Orators, and other famous Writers have drawn this knowledge. Aristotle does not engage himself in that Detail, but leaves it to those, who teach how to make Verses; for after he has given an exact Definition of the eight part of Discourse, he passes in the following Chapter to the Nouns, of which he explains all the Qualities and Differences. When he says, there are eight parts of Diction, it seems, as if 'twas contrary to what Quintilian tells us after Dionysius Halicarnasseus , that Aristotle and Theodectes made only three, Veteres , says he, quorum fuerunt Aristoteles quoque, atque Theodectes, verba modo & nomina, & conjunctiones tradiderunt. The Ancients of which Number were Aristotle and Theodectes, spake only of Verbs, Nouns, and Conjunctions . That is to say, that which doth express, that which is expressed, and that which joins them both together. There Aristotle speaks as a Philosopher; but here as a Poet, and one who would instruct the Poets, and who ought consequently to examine particularly all that enters into the Diction. 2\. A Letter is an indivisible Sound, not of any sort, but articulate, and intelligible .] The Greeks call the Letters by a Word, which signifies Elements; to shew, that as all Bodies are composed of Elements, and resolved into the same Principles, so 'tis with Words, they are all formed of Letters, and return into the same, when they are destroy'd. Since a Letter then is an Element, 'tis an indivisible Sound; for all that, which can be divided, is not a Letter; as no compounded Body can be an Element; but to define a Letter, 'tis not sufficient to say, that it is an indivisible Sound, and for that Cause Aristotle adds, but one which is articulate and intelligible , that is, which signifies something ; for the Voice of Beasts is an indivisible Sound, but 'tis no Letter, because it can signify nothing. 3\. The Letters are divided into Vowels, Demi-Vowels, and Mutes .] The Demi- Vowels and Mutes are these which are called Consonants, because they have no Sound, but when a Vowel either precedes, or follows them. 4\. A Demi-Vowel is that, which borrows the Sound of a Vowel, which precedes it .] This Passage in my Opinion had no Difficulty in it, but by the Difference, which was made between the two Greek Words ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif)  and ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif)  . The first signifies that which is added before, and the latter, that which is added after, and this is the Difference, which is between the Demi-Vowels, and the Mutes. The Demi-Vowel is that, which to be understood, puts a Vowel before, f, l, m, n, r, s, for these Letters sound as if they were writ, ef, el, em, en, er, es . And the Mute is that, which has a Vowel after it, as b, d, g, k, p, q, t, as if 'twere, be, de, ge, ka, pe, qu, te. 5\. There is yet another Difference between them, which is drawn, either from the Conformation of the Mouth, and the other parts which serve for Pronunciation .] Beside them which Aristotle makes them is another, which he speaks of here that is drawn, from those parts which pronounce. Dionysius Halicarnasseus explains this at large, in his XVIII. and XIX. Chapters. This was a necessary Piece of Knowledge for the Greek Tongue; but 'tis of no use to us. We should be no more ingenious to know that, than we make a Mouth to pronunce a, u. VI. Or because they are harsh, or sweet .] The Mutes are divided into Aspirates, sweet, and middle. The Aspirates are ph, ch, th , which are simple in the Greek , the sweet are p, k, t . The Middle b, g, d , they are called Middle, because they are between the Aspirates and the Sweets; for b, is changed into p, and into ph, g is changed into k, and into ch, and d, is changed into t and th. These Changes are of wonderful Use in the Greek. 7\. Short or long, grave or sharp, or Circumflex .] This regards the Vowels only, or the Syllables, which are distinguished by the Quantity, that is, the time of their Pronunciation, or the Accent, which regards the raising or falling the Voice; for the Acute, Accent raises, the Grave falls, and the Circumflex keeps the Voice even. 8\. But 'tis proper to treat of the different Qualities of Letters in those Treatises only, which teach the Art of making Verses .] As 'tis necessary, that a Poet be instructed in the Nature of Letters, and their different Qualities, in order to use them, as they ought to be, to put a sweet Tone, where it ought to be, and an Acute one in its proper Place, & c . for these are the first Elements of Poesy, or Versification; and Aristotle very reasonably refers to those Treatises, which give the Rules; for this is to instruct Poets, and not to make them such. 9\. A Syllable is a Sound, which signifies nothing, and is composed of a Mute and a Vowel .] Which he says, that a Syllable is a Sound, which signifies nothing, 'tis to distinguish them from Monosyllables, which do signify something, as ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , lux , ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , bos , ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , mus ,  &c. and for that Reason are not called Syllables, but Nouns. As for the rest, and is composed of a Mute and a Vowel , he calls all the Consonants Mutes; for the Demi-Vowels are in effect Mutes, when they are compared with the Vowels. 10\. Conjunction is a Sound, which signifying nothing by its self, neither Causes, nor hinders any of the others, it is joyn'd with, to have a Signification, but only determins them to have one only, and which makes one, and the same of all the different Sounds, it unites .] The Conjunction neither adds to, nor takes any thing from the Words, it is found with, 'tis only to unite them, and make one thing of those Words, which are about it, and which wou'd be otherwise disunited. Conjunctions writ, or omitted give a wonderful Ornament to Poesy, for in using them one thing is made of a great many; and in leaving them out, many are made of one. 11\. 'Tis generally at the end, or in the Middle, but sometimes at the beginning .] Our Language has in this Respect almost the same Advantage with the Greek ; for there are Conjunctions for the beginning, for the Middle, and for the End of a Discourse. But those, which are at the End, are not so many as for the others. 12\. An Article is a Sound, which signifying nothing by it self, serves only to shew the Beginning or End of a Discourse .] An Article is either Prepositive, or Subjunctive. The Prepositive, as The , denotes the Beginning of a Discourse; that is to say, that it points out the thing of which we speak, and which it precedes. As, the Book, the Law, the King . Perhaps the Latin is the only Language, that hath not this prepositive Article; It puts the Pronouns instead of it, as hic, iste, ille ; which has almost the same Beauty. The Subjunctive Article is that, which shews the end of a Discourse; that is, it follows the thing it denotes, as whom, which . That which follows, or to separate one thing from another , as I say, or to this Subject, is much more obscure; it seems Aristotle comprehended under the Articles those Terms, which were used to separate one thing from another, as I would say , or to this Subject , which Expressions are used to prevent the Auditor, from changing his Thoughts. The second Definition, which Aristotle gives to an Article, is almost the same, as that of a Conjunction, and so plain, that there is no need of saying any thing to it. 13\. A Noun is a compounded Sound, which signifies something, without denoting the time, and whose parts, signify nothing alone.] A Noun is a compounded Sound , 'tis composed of Letters and Syllables; for there is no Noun of one Letter, which signifies something , that is to distinguish it from a Syllable, which tho' it be a compounded Sound, yet it signifies nothing, without denothing the time , because 'tis rambling and indeterminate. And whose parts signify nothing alone . For if I should disjoin the Word Letter , the parts would signify nothing; and this 'tis, which makes the Difference between a Noun, and a Discourse; for the parts of a Discourse signify something, when they are taken by themselves. 14\. For even in double Noun every Noun separately has no Signification. as Theodore.] A certain Proof, that the parts or Fragments of Nouns, which are dis-join'd signify nothing is, that even Double Nouns, which are composed of two Nouns, that have both their proper Significations, when they are used alone, yet the two parts signify nothing when they are separated; for Theodorus, Theocritus, Democritus , denote certain Men; but if I separate the two Nouns, which compose these Nouns, neither of them will have any Signification, or give any Idea of them. 'Tis by these Compounded Nouns, as 'tis by the Simple, the taking away one Letter entirely destroys them. This is not true in proper Names only, but in Appellatives, and Adjectives also. 15\. But the Verb has this Advantage of the Noun, that it determins the time, which the Noun doth not . The Term, which Aristotle uses here, is very remarkable, he does not say ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  . It denotes but ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , it denotes with that is, that beside the primitive Signification, a Verb has something else which denotes the time; for there are Nouns, which signify time, as a Day, an Hour, Old, New, & c . but in the Nouns the time is the proper Signification of the Word, which 'tis not in the Verbs. 16\. A Case is both in Nouns and Verbs .] The Word Case signifies properly a Termination, Cadence , and agrees as well with Nouns, as Verbs: for the Verbs have different Cadences, as well as the Nouns. Aristotle gives the Word a larger Extent, than it has in the Latin , and then we give it in ours; for it comprehends the Number as the Plural, and the Mood, as the Indicative, the Imperative, the Optative, & c . Our Language is unhappy in this, that its Nouns have no Causes, and are Indeclinable. 17\. Oration, or a Discourse is a compounded sound, which signifies something, and whose parts, tho' separated, have their Signification .] Oration has this in Common with the Noun and the Verb, that 'tis composed of parts, but that which distinguishes it from the Noun and the Verb is, that the parts of these signify nothing, whereas the parts of Oration do for Nouns and Verbs; which are parts of Discourse, have each their particular Signification. 18\. For 'tis not to be imagined, that a Discourse should be always a Composition of Nouns and Verbs, as the Definition of a Man .] Having said, that a Discourse has some parts which have their Signification when separated, he refutes the Error of those, who taught, that all the parts of Discourse had the same Qualification, because a Discourse being composed of Nouns and Verbs, which have their Signification apart, did not loose them by being join'd together; he says, that the whole Discourse is not a compound of Nouns and Verbs, as that which makes the Definition of a Man, A Man is a reasonable Creature . For 'tis certain, that in a Discourse, which is compounded of Nouns and Verbs, all the parts do signify something, but there are others, where there are Nouns without Verbs. When I say, O most surprizing of Miracles! O astonishing Prodigy ! Here is no Verb, and yet some of the parts have their Signification separately, and others not. This in my Opinion is the Sense of the Passage, which is very obscure in the Greek. 19\. An Oration is called One after two Manners .] For an Oration is One , when 'tis a simple Enunciation of one thing, as Socrates taught Vertue to Men. And 'tis One , where it gathers together several Orations, or Discourses, as Members which it unites by proper Connexions. The Orations of Demosthenes , those of Cicero , the Iliad and the Odysses are all after the same Manner. Aristotle has used the same Division in his Analyticks, and in his Treatise of Interpretation. Of Simple and Compounded Nouns of the different sorts of Metaphors, and all other Qualities of Nouns. I. There are two sorts of Nouns, Simple and Double; the Simple are those, which are composed of parts, which signify nothing, and the Double are formed of one Word, which doth, and another which do not signify any thing, or of two Words, which have each their Signification. There are also Triple, and Quadruple Nouns, many  287 of which are to be found in the Dithyrambick Poets. II. Every Noun is either Proper, or Forreign, or Metaphor, or Ornament, or an Invented Noun, or protracted, or substracted, or chang'd. III.  288 A Noun proper is that, which every one makes Use of in the same Place. The Forreign is that, which is used elsewhere, from whence it follows, that the same Noun may be Proper and Forreign  289 by its Relation to different Persons; for the Noun Sigunon is a Proper Word to the Cyprians , but Forreign to us. IV. A Metaphor, is the  290 Translation of a Noun, from its ordinary Signification, there are four sorts of Metaphors , from the Genus to the Species, from the Species to the Genus, from Species to Species, and that which is founded on the Analogy. V. I call a Metaphor from the Genus to the Species, such as this Verse of Homer . My Ship stood in the Port at a Distance from the Town.  291 For the Word Stood is a Generical Term, and is applyed to the Species, by saying, 'twas in the Port. VI. A Metaphor from the Species to the Genus, as in this Place of the same Poet . Certainly Ulysses has done Ten Thousand good Actions; for he puts a Thousand for many. VII.  292 A Metaphor from Species to Species consists in the Resemblance, as if speaking of a Man, who in hopes of making great Advantage, carried something to his House, which was at last the Cause of a considerable Loss, we might say, 'tis the Carpathian with his Hare. VIII. To Conclude , an Analogical Metaphor is, when of four Terms the Second has the same Relation to the First, as the Fourth to the Third; for we may equally say, the Fourth for the Second, and the Second for the Fourth; as also the Third for the First, and the First for the Third. IX. Sometimes also we add the thing, to which the Resemblance is made, and put it instead of that which is proper. For Example, the Cup is the same to Bacchus , as the Shield is to Mars ; we may say then in speaking of a Buckler, that 'tis the Cup of Mars , and in speaking of a Cup, that 'tis the Shield of Bacchus , or thus; the Night is the same to the Day, as old Age is to Life; we may say then in speaking of the Evening, that 'tis the old Age of the Day, and speaking of old Age, that 'tis the Evening, or to use Empedocles's Expression; 'tis the setting of Life. X. It falls out sometimes , that we meet with those things which have no Analogical Term; however, 'tis used in the same manner. For Example , the Word to sow signifies the Action of an Husband Man, who casts the Seed into the Bosom of the Earth;  293 and because there wanted a proper Term to express the Action of the Sun, when he diffuses his Beams over all, yet the thing, which he would express, having the same Resemblance to the Light, as Sowing has to the Grain, a certain Poet said in speaking of the Sun, sowing the Light Divine. XI. There is yet another Manner of using this Metaphor, when  294 after the Metaphorick Noun we add an Epithete, which destroys some Quality, that is proper to it. For Example , as after having called a Shield a Cup, we should say without Wine, instead of adding of Mars. XII. The invented Noun is that, which the Poet himself creates; as if instead of saying ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , Horns, he should say, ![](/images/inline/rbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  Branches, and instead of ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , a Priest, he says ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , that is a Man, who makes Prayers. XIII.  295 The protracted Nouns are those, when a long Vowel is put instead of a short one, as ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  for ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , or when a Syllable is added, as ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif)  , for ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif)  . And the Subtracted Nouns are those, from which a Syllable is taken away, as ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif)  , for  296 ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif)  , for ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ἧ ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ,  , for ![](/images/inline/rbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . XIV. The changed Noun is, when one half remains, as it was before, and the other half is new made, as when Homer made the Word  297 ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . XV. There is yet another Difference between Nouns; Some are Masculine, some Feminine, some Middle, that is to say neuter . The Masculine are those, which end in ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ,  and by one of the double Letters, which are compounded of two Mutes, as ![](/images/inline/PSgk.gif) ,  and Vowels, ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif)  , and ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) Terminations of the Nouns Masculine and Feminine is equal; for ought to be reckoned among the Terminations in ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) . There is no Noun, which ends in a Mute, or a short Vowel. There are only three which terminate in ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , Meli, Commi, Piperi, and five in ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif)  , Pou, Napu, Gonu, Doru, Astu. The Neutres end with these two latter Vowels, with ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif)  , and 1\. There are two sorts of Nouns, the Simple and the Double. The Simple are those, which are compos'd of parts, which signify nothing, and the Double are formed of one Word which doth, and another which doth not signify any thing, or of two Words, which have each their Signification  .] The Difference, which Aristotle puts here between Single and Double Noun is, that the Fragments of the first signify nothing; of the others, one part does signify, and the other does not; and there are those also, of which both the parts signify. But is not this contrary to what he said. That even in the Double Nouns, every Noun being separated signified nothing, as Theodorus. This is no Contradiction. Aristotle speaks in that Place, of Nouns, which after they have been join'd are disunited again, for then every part signifies nothing, and gives no Idea; but here he speaks of the Signification, which those Words have before they enter into the Composition. The Difference then, which is between Double and Simple Nouns is, that the parts of the first signify nothing on any Account, as he elsewhere explains it; but these other signify ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , that is to say, both before they are separated, or either into the Composition of the Noun. 2\. Of one Word which doth, and another which doth not signify any thing .] That which signifies nothing is only an Extension, or Termination of the first. 3\. There are also Triple, and Quadruple Nouns .] The Greeks were very licentious in this sort of Composition, and especially the Dithyrambick Poets. The Latins did not give themselves near so much Liberty; and therefore Quintilian says, that 'twas not permitted to use Triple Nouns in the Latin Tongue: Nam ex tribus nostr ae utique Linguae non concesserim . And for that Reason he condemns this Verse of Pacuvius . Nerei. Repandi Arostrum, incurvi Cervicum pecus. We are more modest, and reserved in our Language, than the Latins were in theirs. 4\. Many of which are to be found in the Dithyrambick Poets .] There is one Word in the Text corrupted, ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif)  . I correct it, ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . Among those who say great things , that is, among the Dithyrambick Poets, whose property is, to elevate themselves to the Skies. Hesychius calls ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . 5\. Every Noun is either Proper, or Forreign.] Aristotle takes Notice here of the eight Qualities of Nouns, which he explains in what follows, the Latins had not such a plenty of them, as the Greeks , nor we as they had. 6\. A Noun Proper is that, which every one makes use of in the same Place .] A Noun Proper is that, which any People make use of in their Language to signify the same thing: 'Tis that which renders a Discourse terse, and intelligible; but as it makes it somewhat mean and low, they found out the way of exalting it by forreign Words, and those other Terms, which Aristotle here explains. 7\. The Forreign is that, which is used elsewhere .] Forreign Nouns are these, which are borrowed from other Languages. These Words extreamely elevate the Diction, and make it Majestick, of which, Aristotle gives this Reason in his Books of Rhetorick. As we feel a certain sort of Pleasure at the Sight of Strangers, which we do not at that of our own Country-Men, whom we see every day, so 'tis in the Diction. Therefore 'tis very proper to disguise the manner of speaking, and to cloath it, as I may say, like a Stranger; for that which comes from Strangers appears admirable, and that which is admirable, pleases and delights us . But as we can't now distinguish in the Works of the Ancients the Forreign Nouns from those, which are proper, we loose one of the greatest Pleasures, the Reading of them could give, and consequently cannot know all their Beauties. The Latins had fewer strange Words, than the Greeks ; and we have almost none in our Language; and that is the Reason, why our Poesy is so flat, and falls so much below that of the Greeks. Homer used the most Rude and Gross words of the Beotians , with a wonderful Grace, and Dionysius Halicarnasseus well observed, that it gives a very great Majesty to his Poem. 8\. From whence it follows, that the same Noun may be Proper and Forreign, by its Relation to different Persons .] 'Tis impossible, that this should be otherwise; that Word which is forreign to him, that borrows it, must necessarily be proper to him, from whom 'tis borrowed. 9\. For the Noun Sigunon, is a proper Word to the Cyprians, but forreign to us .] The Word Signunon , signifies a Dart made all af Iron, Aristotle says, that 'tis Cyprian , and is followed in it, by the Scholiast of Appollonius; Suidas calls it Macedonian, & Eustathius Beotian. 10\. A Metaphor in the Translation of a Noun from its ordinary Signification .] Some of the Ancients blame Aristotle , that he has put the two first under the Metaphorical Noun, when they are properly Synecdoches; but Aristotle speaks in general, and wrote in a time; when the Figures were not so refined, as to be nicely distinguish'd, and have Names given to them, by which their Nature was best explained. Cicero sufficiently justifies Aristotle , when he writes in his Book of an Orator, Itaque Gr aeaci genus hoc appellant Allegoricum, nomine recte, genere melius ille (Aristoteles) qui ista omnia Translationes vocat. 11\.

A Metaphor from the Species to the Genus, as in this Place of the same Poet : Certainly Ulysses has done a thousand good Actions.] 'Tis a Verse of the second Book of the Ilias , when the Greeks praise Ulysses , for beating the insolent Thersites , ἤ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif)  . Where he puts ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif)  , Ten Thousand , which is the Species for ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif)  , many , which is the Genus. Thus Virgil says, Acheloia pocula , instead of saying Water. 13\. The Metaphor from Species to Species consists in the Resemblance .] This is the first true Species of a Metaphor; for those we have already spoke o, are properly Synecdoches, as has been said. The most usual Metaphor then is, that from Species to Species, and it doth properly consist in the Likeness with the thing, from whence, is borrowed hath with that, to which 'tis applyed. When Plato calls the Head a Cittadel; the Tongue the Judge of Tasts; the Pores narrow Streets; the Lungs the Ear of the Heart, & c . they are to many Metaphors, which consist in the Resemblance of one Species to another. 14\. As in speaking of a Man, who in Hopes ,  &c.] Aristotle gives here an Example, taken from one of Homers Verses, but as it can't be translated into our Language, I shall instead of it quote such a Passage of his Rhetorick, where he puts as a Metaphor from Species to Species, that of the Carpathian with his Hare , to denote a Man, who hath suffered much by that, from which he thought to reap great Profit; for the Carpathian being great Admirers of Hares, had Reason to repent of it; for those Hares ruined the Island. 15\. To conclude, An Analogical Metaphor is, when of four Terms the Second has the same Relation to the First as the Fourth to the Third .] After he has explained the Metaphor which consists in the Resemblance, he goes on to that, which consists in the Analogy and Proportion: not that it doth not also consist in the Likeness; for the Likeness is double, and that there is not without it a true Metaphor; but 'tis, because besides the Resemblance, there is an entire Proportion, or Relation. Aristotle understands it thus. I lay down four Terms, Life, Old Age, Day, Evening . We see, that the same Relation, which is between the First and the Second, is also between the Third and the Fourth. Thus I may as well say, Evening , instead of Old Age , the fourth Term for the Second; as Old-Age for Evening , the second for the Fourth. I can use also Day for Life , the third for the First, and Life for Day , the First for the Third. 'Tis the same in the other Example, Mars , a Shield, Bacchus, a Cup , I may use the Third for the First, Bacchus for Mars , and the First for the third, Mars for Bacchus ; The Second for the Fourth, as Shield for Cup , and the Fourth for the Second, Cup for Shield. Aristotle Discourses at large of this Metaphor in his third Book of Rhetorick, where he says, that of the four sorts of Metaphors, we should always endeavour to chuse the Analogical one, because 'tis the finest, and most esteemed; and that every Metaphor which is grounded on Analogy, must necessarily have these two Conditions: First, That it may be inverted, and that the Terms when transposed, equally answer one to another. Secondly, That 'tis grounded on things of the same Nature and Kind. For Example, If 'tis proper to say of Old Age, That 'tis the Winter of the Life . 'Tis also proper to say of Winter, That 'tis the Old Age of the Year . So if it may be said of Bacchus , That the Cup is his Buckler . We may say of Mars , that, The Buckler is his Cup. 16\. Sometimes also we add the thing to which the Resemblance is made, and put it instead of that which is proper.] Heinsius gave himself a needless trouble to correct this Passage, which is so clear, that it had no occasion for it; but supposing it were faulty, his Correction is intolerable. Aristotle means only, that oftentimes the thing to which the Resemblance is made is added, and put instead of that, from which the Resemblance is taken. For Example, Instead of saying simply, A Cup is a Shield ; I say, ' Tis the Shield of Bacchus. So instead of Mars , to whom the Shield is proper, I put the Name of Bacchus , to whom I make the Resemblance: And in speaking of a Shield , I am not satisfy'd to say, That ' tis a Cup ; but that, ' Tis the Cup of Mars; putting Mars for Bacchus . To use another Example, I say, Heaven, Stars, Meadow, Flowers . The Flowers are the same to the Meadow, as the Stars to Heaven. I say then, in speaking of the Stars, That they are the Flowers of Heaven . And in speaking of Flowers, That they are the Stars of the Meadow . And thus in all others. 17\. We say then, in speaking of a Buckler, That 'tis the Cup of Mars.] Aristotle had without doubt, a Passage of Timotheus in View, and another of Antiphanes , both which call a Buckler the Cup of Mars; but I don't remember to have read any where, that a Cup was called, The Buckler of Bacchus. 'Tis probable, that Atheneus took from this place the hint of calling Nestor's Cup, his Shield. 18\. It falls out sometimes, that we meet with those things which have no Analogical Term, however 'tis used in the same manner .] As he has show'd the Analogical Metaphors to be perfect, ought to bear an Inversion; and that the two Subjects from whence they are taken, have each of them a reciprocal Term, which may be transpos'd from one Subject to another; so now he tellsus, That Subjects are often found, which having no proper Term borrow it from another, without being able reciprocally to return it. For Example, When an Husbandman casts the Seed on the Ground, there is a proper Term to denote the Action, which is to Sow ; but when the Sun casts his Beams, there is no proper Term which expresses that Action: Wherefore in speaking of the Sun, we are obliged to borrow the Term of the Husbandman; but in speaking of an Husbandman, we can borrow no Term from the Sun, because it has none which is proper to him, the Analogy is then imperfect, because the same Term serves two Subjects; but however 'tis used, an Ancient said of the Sun, Sowing the Light Divine. Virgil says the same in speaking of Aurora . Et jam prima novo spargebat lumine terras. And, Postera vix summos spargebat lumine montes, Orta dies. And Lucretius says of the Sun, Et lumine conserit arva. 19\. There is another Manner of using this Metaphor, when after the Metaphorical Noun, we add an Epithet, which destroys some Quality that is proper to it.] Aristotle has taught in what manner an Analogical Metaphor is used, and says that the Name of the Subject to which the Resemblance is made, is often added, instead of that from which it is taken; as when a Buckler is called, The Cup of Mars. He tells us here, That there is another way of using this Figure, when in lieu of using the Name of the Subject, we add a Negative Epithet only; that's to say, which denies the Quality, that is most proper to the Metaphorical Term which is used. Thus, if instead of calling a Buckler, The Cup of Mars, we should call it, a Cup without Wine , ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  ; and in lieu of calling a Cup, The Buckler of Mars, it should be called, ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , A Buckler which is not made for Combats. Aristotle designs this Metaphor, when he says in his Rhetorick, ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  &. A Bow is an Harp without Strings . And when he calls a Consort of Voices only, ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἂ ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , A Consort without Lute and Instruments ; and the Sound of the Trumpet, ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , An Harmony which is without a Lute . This Figure is common, especially in the Greek Poets, who have used it very happily. Victorius quotes several Examples: Euripides uses it twice in the same place, when he makes Iphigenia say, ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) . ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif)  , for he calls those Complaints and Regrets, Elegies without a Lyre ; and the Groans, Songs without Musick . The same Poet in the Chorus of the Phoenician Women , calls an Army, ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . A Feast without Flutes. Aristotle says very well in his Rhetorick, that tho' these Negative Terms express nothing of themselves, because they signifie nothing that is positive, that they are very much esteemed in those Metaphors which are founded on Analogy. Our Language sometimes can use these Metaphors accompanied with the Negative Epithetes; but not so often as the Greek. 20\. An Invented Name is that which the Poet himself creates ,  &c.] After the Metaphor, that which Aristotle calls Ornament , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , should follow; how comes he then to forget it? Is it because the Ornament springs from the Metaphors; so that having explained their different Species, he thought there was no need to explain what an Ornament was? 'Tis not the usage of our Philosopher to advance any thing without explaining it. If he had had a design to mix the Ornament with the Metaphors, he would not have made a separate part of it. I rather think, with Madius and Victorius , that the Text is defective, and that by the Negligence of some Copyist, what Aristotle said of Ornament is lost, either where he had explained it, or refer'd to the place where he would do it; for 'tis possible that he might have reserv'd the treating of the Ornament to the Second or Third Book of his Art of Poetry; it appearing by a Passage in Simplicius , that he spoke of Synonyma's in those Books. However it be, what he means by the word Ornament, is the Epithete which he calls ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , in the Third Book of his Rhetorick; that is to say, proper . The reason of this difference of Names, is, that the Orators use few Epithets for Ornament. They employ them only to express the things they speak of the better, whereas the Poets use them at every turn to grace and adorn their Discourses: For as Quintilian says after Aristotle , an Epithet is a very great Ornament. Wherefore the Poets say, White Milk, Moist Water, Shameful Poverty, Melancholy Old Age , &c. But tho' these Epithets are properly made for Poesie, and a Discourse which has none, appears naked and disagreeable, the use of them is limited by Rules and Bounds. If a Poem is too full of Epithets 'tis flat; if they are ill chosen, and not well adapted, 'tis ridiculous and displeasing, and the Poet is guilty of the Fault, which Aristotle accuses Cleophon of, who would thus adorn the least Discourses, and express himself to Ridiculously, that he said, Venerable Eggs . But to come to the Invented Names. 21\. An Invented Name, is that which the Poet himself creates ,  &c.] Aristotle speaks here of simple words only, and not of compounded ones, because properly speaking, the simple ones alone can be Invented, the other being formed of those which are already known, and in use. The Ancients observed, that Homer Invented several; Aristotle gives us two, the last is in the First Book of the Iliads , but I don't know where the first, ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ,  or ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , Branches for Horns is found, for I don't think 'tis in any of Homer's Works which now remain. 'Tis probable that on this Virgil says, Ramosa Cornua . Et Ramosa Mycon vivacis Cornua Cervi. And elsewhere. Cornibus arboreis. 22\. The protracted Nouns are those where a long Vowel is put for a short one .] What Aristotle says of protracted, substracted, and Invented Nouns, is proper to the Greek only, which diversity made it so copious, florid, and proper to fill up all the Characters of Poesie, and Eloquence, that it can express ev'ry thing very happily. The Latins endeavoured to imitate this copiousness, by their Apocopes, Syncopes, & c . but twould not succeed; for what is very agreeable to one Language, is not so to another. The different Dialects which were properly the usages of the different Countries of Greece , gave them the liberty of using all those ways of speaking, and which were not allowed to the Poets only, but to the Orators, Historians, and Philosophers; and this liberty of changing Letters, and new casting, as I may say, the words, which however altered they were, were still known by the common usage, is one of the chief Causes of that admirable Variety, wonderful Harmony, and inimitable Energy, which are found in the Greek Writers. They were not satisfied to Protract, Subtract, and Invent Nouns, but they used the same Changes in the Parts of Periods; nay, even in the Periods themselves. If we consult Dionysius Halicarnasseus , we shall find what Graces and Beauties they knew, to give to their Pieces, There's an infinite Distance betwixt the Copiousness and Sweetness of that Language, and the Penury and Stiffness of ours. This in respect to the other, may be compared to a Tyrant, who commands his Architects and Workmen to build him a fine House, and gives them only a small quantity of Stones as they came out of the Quarry and Timber without being hewn, with a strict Command to use them as they are without any Alteration. Just such is their Condition who write in English , if it happily falls out that the Materials are of a proper Figure to be adjusted together, 'tis very well; but if there be any knotty, unequal, rough, as often happens, they have no liberty to correct, and make them smooth. This is also the Reason, why we have nothing that is perfect and finish't, that can come into Comparison with the fine Works of Ancient Greece , which always excel ours. especially in this respect; that is, the Composition and the ranging the Words. 23\. The Substracted Nouns, are those from which a Syllable is taken away .] The Latins have the same, sam, sos, sis , for suam, suos, suis. Ennius said gau, for gaudium, Coel . for Coelum. Do for Domum ; but that was not followed: They now say only mi for mihi, caldum for calidum, dixti for dixisti, surpuerat for suripuerat, decesse for decessisse , and such like. 24\. There is yet another Difference between Nouns, some are Masculine, some Feminine; and some Neuter .] I have chose to follow the Sence rather than the Letter, in Translating this place, and what Aristotle meant than what he said, for the Words have been altered, and spoiled by the Copyists: And thus we see what he wrote. 'Tis certain that there is no Greek Nouns that ends with any of the Nine Mutes. or by ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) . ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif)  any more than by the two short Vowels ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ,  and these ten the three long, ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) , are for Feminines; Neuters; and the five others, ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/PSgk.gif)  and Masculines, Feminines and Neuters. 25\. There are but three which end in ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , eri, Trophi, cri , and all the Neuters of the Adjectives in spoke of the three first as Foreign Words; the other three are subtracted Words for Erion, Trophimon, Crimnon . He speaksthere of Nouns Substantives and Primitives only. 26\. And five in u.] Besides the five there are dacru , and molu , and all the Neuters of Adjectives in us; E[illeg.]u, hedu, baru. What 'tis that renders the Expressions clear and noble, of Barbarisms and Ænigms. What 'tis that properly makes an Enigm. The Frivolous Criticism of the Ancient Euclid on Homer. The greatest Ornaments of Speech are Vitious, if they are used too often. The Advantage of figured Words, beyond those which are proper. A Verse of Æschylus, made Noble by Addition of a Word in Euripides. The ridiculous Criticism of Ariphrades on the Tragick Poets. The Division of all the Ornaments of Discourse, and to what Works each of them does particularly belong. 1\. The Virtue of an Expression, consists in its  298 Purity, and Nobleness. That which is composed of simple Words, is very clear; but 'tis also low, as is seen in Cleophon's and Sthbenelus 'S Poetry. The Noble Expression, and which differs from the common ways of speaking, is that which employs borrowed Words. I call those Borrowed Words , Words of Foreign Tongues, Metaphors, protracted Words; and to conclude , all that is not a proper Word. 2\. But if these sorts of Terms were employed  299 throughout, we should make either Enigms, or Barbarisms. The Metaphors, if too much used , would degenerate into a Riddle, and the Foreign Words taken from strange Languages, would produce obscure Barbarisms. For a Riddle properly consists, in saying things,  300 in such a manner, that it makes them appear impossible; this cannot be done by a simple Composition of Words, for only Metaphors have the Power to make an Enigm, as is seen in this celebrated Riddle. I Saw a Man who Glued Tin to a Man with Fire , and such like. The Barbarism  301 can be produced only by the use of strange Words, and therefore they ought to be used with a great deal of Judgment and Caution. 3\. To make an Expression therefore that shall be neither common, nor mean, we must have recourse to Foreign Words, Metaphors, and Ornaments: And all those other sorts which I have mentioned, and to make proper Words to render it clear and pure . But there is a certain way to render it at the same time clear and noble; that is, to make use of protracted, substracted, or changed Words; for that which is extraordinary in them, makes them to appear different from the proper Words , produces the loftiness; and what they retain of the common usage gives the Purity. 4\. 'Tis for this reason, that those who condemn this sort of Expression and blame  302 Homer, for writing it, do it without any reason ; as the Ancient Euelid , who maintains that there is nothing easier than to  303 be a Poet, if we have liberty to protract Words according to our Fancies, and laughs at the Poet for following the same Method in his Verse,  304 5\. 'Tis not the thing it self which makes the Affectation, 'tis the continual using these Manners of Speech. Fer there is a measure common to all these different Species, and which should never be transgressed. This is so true, that if we should use after the same manner Metaphors, Foreign Words, and all those other Figures which I have explained , either with Care or with a design to make them appear Ridiculous, we should succeed in both with the same ease. 6\. To be convinced of  305 the Beauty which the figur'd Speeches give to the Diction, provided they be agreeable, well placed, and in just Proportion, we need only take the Verses of an Epick Poem, or Tragedy, and change the Terms. If instead of Metaphors, Foreign Words, and the other Figures, we should substitute proper Words, we would find that we had advanced nothing but the Truth. 7\. Æ schylus and Euripides hath both made the same Iambick Verse; but because the latter put a  306 Metaphorical Word in the Place of one which was common and usual , he made the Verse very lofty, whereas  307 that of Æ schylus was low and mean. Æ schylus made his Philoctetes say, of the Word Eats , which is common, makes a Metaphorical Term, and by that heightens his Expression. 8\.  308 We should destroy the Beauty of most part of Homer's Verses, if in the place of those Choice and Noble Terms, he used, we should put proper Words. For Example: When Homer says (to represent the terrible Noise, which the enraged Sea makes:) The Rivers Roard , we should put, The Rivers Cried , we should spoil it. 9\. There was also one Ariphrades , who laugh'd at the Tragick Poets for using such Expressions as no one durst do in ordinary Discourse.  309 For Example: When they reverse of the Prepositions, and put them after the Nouns, and such like. But 'tis for this very reason, because these ways of speaking, are neither proper, nor in common use, that they elevate the Style of the Poets, and distinguish it from the simplicity of the ordinary and familiar Language, and this that Critick was  310 Ignorant of. 'Tis fine, tho' difficult , to make use of all those Figures which we have explained agreeably, and to the purpose, as the double and Foreign Words: But 'tis mnch finer and difficult, to use the Metaphor happily. And truly that's the only thing which cannot be borrowed elsewhere, and shows a naturally happy  311 and sprightly Genius. For to  312 make this Translation or one thing to another as it ought to be, is to see at once, what is alike in very different Subjects. 11\. The double Words agree particularly to Dithyrambicks. The Foreign Words to Heroick, and the Metaphors to Iambick Verses. But the double, and Foreign Words, the Metaphors and all the other sorts of which we have spoken, may be of use in Heroick Verse; whereas the Iambick, which Imitates only the Familiar Style, can employ no Terms but such as are used in Conversation; that is, proper Words, the Metaphor, and the Ornament. 12\. What we have said, is sufficient for Tragedy, and the Imitation, which doth consist in Action. 1\. The Virtue of an Expression consists in its Purity and Loftiness; That which is Composed of Simple Words is very clear, but 'tis also low .] That which most contributes to render a Discourse clear and intelligible, are the proper Words, because they are known by every Body: But they make it common and low by the same Reason: For whatever is common, is generally mean and despicable; wherefore to take away that Baseness, we must have recourse to the Terms which Aristotle has explained, and which render the Diction Noble and Majestick. 2\. As is seen in Cleophon's and Sthenelus's Poetry .] They were two Tragick Poets: I don't know when the first was, the other lived in the time of Lysias and Pericles , about the ninetieth Olympiad. The Style of these two Poets was low, because they used only common Terms. Aristotle in the Third Book of his Rhetorick charges Cleophon with another Fault; for he accuses him of using the Ornaments so uncouthly, when he endeavoured to add them to his Diction, that he was Ridiculous, and his Style perfectly Comical; for that is generally the Effect of Ornaments when they are misunderstood. 3\. But if these sorts of Terms were employed throughout, we should make either Enigms, or Barbarisms. The Metaphors too much used, would degenerate into a Riddle .] As he has taken notice of the Fault they are guilty of, who use only proper Nouns; he shews them also, into which they would fall, who should employ the other Terms only, and this Error is greater than the first. For a Riddle and Obscurity in Diction, are the greatest of all its Vices. This is the Fault of Lycophron among the Greeks , and Persius among the Latins. 4\. And the Foreign Words taken from strange Langnages, would produce obscure Barbarisms .] For this Barbarism consists properly, in the use of Foreign Words, as when Catullus said Ploxinon , which is a Gallick Word; and Labienus used Casnar , which is Thuscan , and Virgil, Gaza and Mapalia , the first of which is Persian , and the other Carthaginian . These Foreign Words, give a Loftiness and Majesty to the Discourse, when they are used with Moderation and Discretion, but make it Barbarous, when they are used too often; the Barbarism then consists in the too frequent use of these Foreign Words. 5\. For a Riddle properly consists, in saying things, in such a manner, that it makes them appear impossible, this cannot be done, by a simple Composition of Words, for only Metaphors, have the Power to make an Enigm .] This Passage is remarkable, because it teaches us two things, which are necessary for an Enigm. The one is a Metaphor, and the other that it appears impossible; for if we propose a thing that seems impossible, without the Metaphor, or use the Metaphor without making the thing appear impossible, 'twill not be properly a Riddle. There is a third Condition, no less necessary to a Riddle than the two others; and that is, that the Subject of it be natural and known to every Body. For this Reason that Riddle of Sampson's in the fourteenth Chapter of Judges, Out of the Eater came forth Meat, and out of the Strong came forth Sweetness , appears not to be a true one, because it wants the two last Conditions. That in the Third Eclogue of Virgil. Dic quibus in Terris, & eris mihi Magnus Apollo, Tres pateat Coeli spatium non amplius ulnas. Is no true Enigm, because all the Terms are Simple, and there is no Metaphor; for he speaks of Coelius's Tomb. However that which is obscure, is called a Riddle, after what manner soever it be express'd. 6\. As is seen in this Celebrated Riddle , I saw a Man who glued Tin, to another Man with Fire . Aristotle cites this Enigma again in the Third Book of his Rhetorick, Demetrius quotes it after him in his Treatise of Elocution; but they have taken only the first Verse: Atheneus gives us the Distich entire. ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) &sbetigr; ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ,  . ![](/images/inline/Ogk.gif) ὕ ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) . I saw a Man who glew'd Tin to another with Fire, so that the Blood ran, into the Tin as into the Man . He speaks here of the Applications of ( what we call ) Cupping-glasses, which were not made of Glass in those Days, but of Tin. 'Tis plain that this Riddle has all the necessary Conditions: The Subject is known, the Proposition appears impossible, and the Expression is Metaphorical; that is to say, Tin for a Cupping-glass , that's the Genus for the Species; to Glew , is also a Metaphor, for there being no proper Term for the Manner of applying Cupping-glasses, and to glew being a means of making one thing stick to another, he who made the Riddle, used that Word the better to express the Application of the Cupping-glasses; and nothing can be more exact than that Relation. 7\. But there is a certain way to render it, at the same time clear and noble; that is, to make use of the protracted, substracted, and changed Words .] For we find in all those Words, the proper , which make the clearness; and the Foreign , or Extraordinary , which make the loftiness; but I have already said, these Beauties are found only in the Greek , the Latins have little advantage of us in that respect, so that they were reduced, as well as we, to look for that loftiness of Style, in the choice of the Words, in the good and proper use of Similitudes, Comparisons, Metaphors, and all the Figures. 8\. ' Tis for this reason, that those who condemn this sort of Expression, and blame Homer for using it, do it without any reason, as the Ancient Euclid.] 'Tis not only now, that Homer has found unjust Censurers, he had them also in the most refined Ages, but they both then and now had only Confusion and Shame, for all the painful Labour they underwent. There was an Ancient Euclid , not him, who was Contemporary with Plato and Aristotle ; whose admirable Propositions we now have, whom Aristotle particularly distinguishes, least we should be mistaken, and that any one should be so Injurious to his Friend, as to believe that he would write against the greatest Poet. This Euclid , in order to make Homer's Works ridiculous, had composed a Poem in Heroick Verse, in which he used at almost ev'ry Word, those Figures which Homer uses, in due measure, and very much to the purpose. Aristotle refutes this Writer solidly, by shewing, that he wrote either thro' Ignorance or Malice. 9\. Either following the same Method in his Verses.] Aristotle quotes two Verses of this Euclid's , I have not translated them because they are corrupted, and tell us nothing which is new. Heinsius has endeavoured to correct them; but his Efforts have been fatal to the Passage of Aristotle it self, of which he has spoiled the Sense, and made it unintelligible. As for me, I believe that those Verses ought to be writ thus. ![](/images/inline/rbEEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) .

' Tis not the thing it self, which makes the Affectation, 'tis the continual use of these Manners of Speech .] This is a Refutation of Euclid ; for Aristotle tells him, That Homer us'd these Manners of speaking, which he blames, in a just proportion, and much to the purpose, but you place them without any measure, and when there is no occasion for them. 'Tis you therefore, and not Homer who are ridiculous; for those protracted, substracted, and changed Nouns, are not blameable but according to the Vicious Affectation you employ them with, and this is what he proceeds to prove. 11\. For there is a measure common to all those different Species, and which should never be transgress'd .] There is nothing but ought to have its just measure, and if this be necessary in every thing, 'tis much more so in those which serve only for Ornament. Every Word which is not proper, is of this Nature: That's to say, 'tis only used to embellish, and elevate a Discourse; and consequently, as Aristotle here says, there is a measure for these Ornaments, which is common to them all; and that is, not to employ them but to the purpose, when the Subject requires it; and they add some Beauty, for there is nothing more requisite, than this good Management. There are a thousand Opportunities, where these Ornaments may be used Ridiculously and Impertinently; but they make a Poem Flat and Insipid when they are used too often; and when they are not necessary, they are not relishing, and proper as it were to excite the Appetite, 'tis a relish which cloys, and gives an horrible Disgust. 12\. This is so true, that if we should use after the same Manner, Metaphors, Foreign Words ,  &c.] To shew Euclid , that the Ridicule did not consist in the Figures themselves, but the too frequent use of them: He says, that the finest things, and those the World admires most, may be made as ridiculous, if they be used with that Design. 13\. To be convinced of the Beauty which the figured Speeches give to the Diction, provided they be agreeable, well placed, and in just proportion, we need only take an Epick Poem or Tragedy, and change the Terms .] After he has refuted Euclid , he confirms his Opinion by an Experiment, and says very well, that if we take the Sublimest Verses of an Epick Poem, or a Tragedy, and put proper Words instead of the figured ones, it will lose all its Elevation and Nobleness of Style. 14\. Æschylus made his Philoctetes say , This Ulcer which Eats my Flesh. ] In Æ schylus's Verse, ![](/images/inline/PHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ἥ ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) . The Word ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , to Eat , is a proper Word, and consequently more common and mean, wherefore Euripides changed it, and put into its place ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ,  which is a Metaphorical Word, and signifies, to feast, to devour, to feed : When Virgil speaks of the Serpent which devoured Laocoon's Sons, he says, \--- Miscros morsu depascitur artus. And renders the Expression much more noble by the compounded Word. 15\. We should destroy the Beauty of most part of Homer's Verses, if in the place of those choice and noble Terms he has used, we should put proper Words.] Aristotle quotes two of Homer's Verses, which I have not Translated, because our Language has not figur'd Words to express them: But Homer is full of other Examples, which may be put in the place of those I have suppressed: We need only open his Book to find them. 16\. There was also one Ariphrades, who laughed at the Tragick Poets .] As Euclid had found fault with Homer's Composition, there was one Ariphrades , who condemned the Tragick Poets, by reason of the lib eerty which they took, of putting the Propositions, after Nouns, and say ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif)  , Domo ex, the House out of instead of ex Domo, out of the House. Aristotle shews that this Critick blamed them thro' his own Ignorance, by not perceiving that these uncommon ways of speaking, ennobled their Style, and took away all that was common or familiar in it. 'Tis sufficient that it be according to the Genius of the Language, 'tis they will be Ridiculous who despise it. 17\. ' Tis fine, tho' difficult, to make use of all those Figures which we have explained, agreeably, and to the Purpose, as the double and Foreign Words, but 'tis much more difficult to use the Metaphor happily .] 'Tis no easie matter to invent these Words nicely, and to use properly these Foreign ones, Epithets, protracted, subtracted, and changed Words; however a moderate Genius may attain to it; but to invent the Metaphors happily, is the greatest effort of the Ingenuity, and to do it, there is required a very happy and fruitful Invention. Aristotle gives us the reason of this. 18\. And truly that's the only thing which cannot be borrowed elsewhere, and which shows a naturally happy and sprightly Genius. For to make this Translation of one thing to another, as it ought to be, is to see all at once, what is alike in very different Subjects .] The Foreign Words are borrowed from other People. The Language furnishes the double Words; those which are lengthned, shortned and changed, as also that Epithets they are drawn from the different Dialects, new Words, made according to fancy, which should be always conducted by Imitation. 'Tis not the same with Metaphors, for they in order to be agre eeable, should be new, and taken from those things which are neither to common, nor too rare; 'tis for this reason Aristotle says, That it is the only thing which cannot be borrowed elsewhere; and consequently there must be more Ingenuity to invent these Metaphors, than to make a very proper use of all the other Ornaments. Thus we see, that those who have had the quickest Wit and Imagination, have excelled in those ways of speaking, and the more, as their Language has been filled with Metaphors. And truly since a Metaphor consists in the Resemblance, and in the Proportion, they only who have an Ingenious Invention, and sprightly Imagination, can see all at once the likeness of very different Subjects. thus we see that a Metaphor carries the marks of its Original; for it appears only to enlighten, and always communicates to the Mind some new Knowledge, which the other Ornaments are incapable of doing. For Example, when any one tells me that Compassion is an Altar , by that I understand that Compassion is in the Heart, that which an Altar is in the Temple, that is to say an Azylum, and refuge for the Unhappy. Aristotle proves in the Third Book of his Topicks, that whatsoever we cannot acquire but by it self, is preferable to that, which we can acquire by the assistance of another, by which he shews the excellence of Justice, beyond force. This Rule which is excellent in Morality, may serve admirably well to shew the Advantage a Metaphor has over all the other Figures of Discourse. 19\. The double Words agree particularly to Dithyrambicks ,  &c.] Having shewn the different Qualities of Words, and the Advantages of Sence beyond others, he takes care particularly to shew, in what Works each of them ought to be employed. And this is what he has touched on in the Third Book of his Rhetorick; where he says, That the double Words are entirely Politick, and that they agree perfectly well with the Dithyrambick Poesie, because its Style is very lofty, and its aim to sound great, that the Foreign Words are most proper to Heroick Poem, because it is Noble, and loves that which is so: And that the Metaphor agrees best with Iambick Verses, and the Stage. But he tells us here, That the Heroick Verse uses that which is proper to the Dithyrambick and Iambick; but the Iambick Verse does not use all, that enters into Epopoeia, and the reason is drawn from the different Characters of those two Poems. Insomuch that he who has this different Character in view, will never transgress the Bounds which Aristotle prescribes, nor employ that in Tragedy, which is proper for Epick Poem only. Our Poets have not always observed this Management. 20\. That is, proper Words, the Metaphors, and the Ornaments .] By Ornaments he means the Epithets, which belong also to the Familiar Style. 21\. What we have said, is sufficient for Tragedy, and the Imitation which does consist in Action.] Aristotle takes care to inform us, that he is come to the end of the Treatise of Tragedy, which he had promised and prepares us, for what he is to do in Epopoeia, in setting before our Eyes the difference of those two Poems, one of which imitates by Action, and the other by Narration. The Application of the Rules of Tragedy to Epick Poem. The Difference of this Poem from History. The Art of Homer, in which he is wonderful. The defect of the Cypriacks, and the little Iliad. How many Subjects of Tragedy the Iliad and the Odysses can furnish, and how many have been taken from the little Iliad. 1\. As for the Imitation  313 which consists in Narration, and is made in Hexameter Verses, ' tis evident that the Fables of it ought to be formed as that of a Dramatick Poem, as Tragedy, and ought to include one only Action, entire, perfect, and finished, and which consequently has a beginning, middle, and an end. For 'tis necessary that it give the Pleasure which is proper to it, as one Living and Animated Body: And to effect that, it should not follow the Rules of History, where we are obliged to relate not one Action only, but all the Events which happened in such a space of Time, either to one or more Persons, and which have very little Connexion with one another. For if the Sea-Fight at Salamine , and the Battle of the Carthaginins in Sicily , which were about the same time, have no relation to the same end; much less, shall those things which fall out at different Times, and after one another, tend to the same Design. 2\. However 'tis in this, that most of  314 Poets offend; and 'tis in this as I have said, that Homer 315 appears Divine in respect to them, for having a War before him which had a Beginning and an End, thinking that it would be too great, and could not be comprehended (as it were) at one View, he did not undertake tn treat of it entirely.  316 He was sensible also, that if he should have found out the Secret of reducing it to a just extent, yet he  317 could oot have avoided the Disorder and Confusion, which such great Variety of Incidents would have thrown him into. For this reason he took one part only, and draws from the rest a great Number of Episodes, as the List of the Ships, and many others, by which he enriches and diversifies his Poem. 3\. It is not so with other Poets: They imagine they preserve the Unity of the Subject , when they confine themselves to the Actions of one Man only; or the Accidents which happened in a certain space of time, or one History only, tho' it has divers Parts, such is the Conduct of the Poet who made the Cypriacks , and of him who composed the Little Iliad. Thus we see, that neither Homer's Ilia's nor Odysses, can furnish but one Subject for Tragedy, or two at most, whereas a great many may be taken from the Cypriacks , and the Little Iliad will afford more than eight, as the Iudgment of Arms, Philoctetes, Neoptolemus, Eurypylus, The Beggar, Helena, The Taking of Troy, The Return of the Greeks, Sinon, The Troades. 1\. As for the Imitation which consists in Narration, and is made in Hexameter Verses, 'tis evident that the Fable of it ought to be formed, as that of a Dramatick Poem, as Tragedy.] Aristotle told us in the fifth Chapter, that Epopoeia has this in common with Tragedy, that 'tis an Imitation of the Actions of the greatest Persons, and took care to inform us, that all the Parts of this Poem are to be found in Tragedy; and now having explained perfectly, and particularly, all which regards the Composition of the Dramatick Poem, he has little more to say of the Epopoeia, and that is the reason, why he is so short in his Treatise; it takes up but two Chapters, which are properly speaking, only a summary Recapitulation, and an Application of those Rules to Epopoeia, which he has given for Tragedy. The first Precept which he lays before us, is, That the Fable of an Epick Poem, ought to be Dramatick; that is Active, as that of Tragedy; and this he says, is evident; and truly 'tis a Consequence of the Difinition of Epopoeia, that 'tis the Imitation of an Action. The only difference between the Dramatick of these two Poems is, That Tragedy Imitates without Narration, and Epopoeia Imitates by its Assistance; that is to say, that it does not bring Actors before the Spectators, 'tis the Poet only that speaks, but he often interrupts his Discourse, to make his Persons Speak and Act, that he may give the Action to his Poem, which it requires. This is the Dramatick of Epopoeia; and 'tis in this Sence that Aristotle said, That Homer made Dramatick Imitations . A Poet ought at first to form his Fable that it be Active; and therefore Aristotle condemns those who search History for some true Heroe, before they have done that. The Foundation of those Poems, is no Fable, and consequently they cannot be Epick Poems. See what I have Remark'd on Horace's Art of Poetry, and on the tenth Chapter of this Work. 2\. And ought to Include one only Action, entire, perfect, and finished, and which consequently has a beginning, middle, and an end .] For Epopoeia as Tragedy, is the Imitation of one Action only, and not of many. The Subject of all other Imitations is only one also, as he says in the ninth Chapter. If Epopoeia should imitate many Actions, 'twould be an History, and not a Poem. See the Remarks on the eighth and ninth Chapters. 3\. For 'tis necessary that it give the Pleasure which is proper to it, as one living and animated Body .] The Greek says, As an Animal ,  &c. he used this Comparison in the eighth Chapter, and nothing could better explain his thought to us; for as the whole Animal is composed of different parts, which make the same whole, without any one Parts being of a different Nature, and which give the Spectator the Pleasure it ought to give; so must it be in Epopoeia and Tragedy, they must be composed of different Parts, which make one and the same whole; and give to the Spectator the Pleasure which is proper for them to give. Those who trespass against this Rule, will be guilty of the Fault which Horace condemns in the first Verses of his Art of Poetry: They put an Horses Neck, to a Man's Head. 4\. And to effect that, it should not follow the Rules of History, where we are obliged to relate not only one Action, but all the Events which happened in such a space of time .] This Passage is much corrupted in the Text, or at least I don't understand it, for I can't know what ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ,  , means, word for word, 'tis neque similes Historias consuetas esse : I believe it should be thus Corrected, ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  ; or thus, ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ὃ ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ,  , neque similes Historiis Compositiones esse . He says, That in the Composition of the Incidents, the Connexion which unites the Parts that make an Epick Poem, ought not to be like that which unites the Parts of an History. For in an History many events are gathered together, which have only a fortuitous Connexion, and depend not one on another, but by the time in which they happened; whereas the Incidents of an Epick Poem, ought to be so link't one with another, that they make one and the same Action. If a Poet should insert any Incident which was not a Natural part of his Fable, nor Matter proper for Epopoeia, it must be at least necessary to give an account of some part of the Action. This is entirely opposite to the Rules of History, and sufficiently clear. 5\. And which have very little Connexion with one another .] That's to say, which have no Connexion, but by the time in which they happened, for in other respects they are very different, and one is not the cause of another. 6\. For if the Sea-Fight at Salamine, and the Battle of the Carthaginians in Sicily, which were about the same time, have no relation to the same end, much less shall those things which fall out at different Times, and after one another, tend to the same Design.] Aristotle had no better way than this Comparison, to make us understand rhe difference which is between the Incidents that compose an Epick Poem, and those which enter into an History. Among these latter, those which seem most alike, and are very near, are very different, and tend not to the same end: For example, Herodotus tells us in the same Book of the Fight at Salamine , where the Greeks beat Xerxes , and of the Battle which Gelon gain'd in Sicily over the Carthaginians , who were led by Amilcar . Some say, that both these Fights happened the same Day. There is nothing more different, for as they have not both of them the same Cause, neither do they concur to the same end; since therefore there is so vast a difference between Actions, which happen in the same Hour, what ought we to expect from those which come to pass in different Ages. They all find a place in History, which does not confine it self to relate one Action only; 'twould be ridiculous to make them enter into an Epick Poem, when only those Incidents are admitted, which altogether make the same whole, and aim at the same Design. 7\. However 'tis in this that most of the Poets offend and 'tis in this, as I have said, that Homer appears Divine in respect to them, for having a War before him which had a beginning and an end, he did not undertake to treat of it entirely .] What Aristotle says here of Homer's taking only one part of the Trojan War, seems to contradict what he had advanced, viz . That the Action of an Epick Poem should be an entire and perfect whole; but the Author of the Treatise of Epick Poem has plainly shewn, that these contrary Expressions agree very well in their Sense; for the Anger of Achilles , which Homer hath taken for the only Subject of his Poem, is a part, in respect to the War of Troy , and the History from whence it is drawn; but 'tis entire and finished in the Fable, and Poem, which he formed. The Poet may take the entire Action of an History, or one part only; but he is always obliged to put an entire Action into his Poem, and not a part. Homer in his Odysses , and Virgil in his Æ neids , have taken an entire Action. Homer proposes Ulysses's return, who after the Destruction of Troy , arrives in his own Country: Virgil proposes the Change of a State, which was ruined in Troy , and re-established in Italy by Æ neas : Each of these Actions is an whole, as well in the History from whence they are taken, as in the Fables in which they are employed. 'Tis not the same with the Action of the Ilia's , that is only one part of the History of the War of Troy ; but it becomes a Regular whole, in the Poem, by the good Management of the Poet; for that Anger of Achilles has its Causes, Effects, and End; and to shew that the War of Troy is not the Subject of the Ilia's, Homer ends his Poem with Hector's Funeral, before the twelve Days of Truce were expired, and the Fighting re-commenced. 9\. And draws from the rest, a great Number of Episodes, as the List of the Ships, and many others, by which he enriches, and diversifies his Poem.] Aristotle doth not say, That Homer uses a great many Episodes of the Action, which he had chosen : For what Episodes could Achilles's Anger furnish? But he says, that that Poet used many Episodes which he took from the Trojan War, and whence he had his Subject, and truly this is a great part of Homer's Cunning: He does not Sing of the Trojan War, but draws Episodes from it, which he renders proper to his Action, by accommodating them to the ground of his Fable, as has been taken notice of elsewhere: The List of the Ships which is at the end of the second Book of the Ilia's , is an Episode of this Nature; and 'tis evident, that that Episode is drawn from the same History that the Subject is taken from. 'Tis the same of all the rest, and this 'tis which makes the Fable the more probable, in giving it all the appearance of truth: See the eleventh Remark on the nineteenth Chapter. 10\. 'Tis not the same with other Poets, they imagine they preserve the Vnity of the Subject, when they confine themselves to the Actions of one Man only .] This is a Confirmation of what he said, in the eighth Chapter. For this reason it seems to me, that all the Poets, who have made an Heracleide , or a Theseide , or any such like Poem, are deceived very much; for they were in the wrong to think, that because Theseus was one, and one Fable, and that the Vnity of the Heroe, made the Vnity of the Action. Statius fell into this Mistake, when he sung not one Action of Achilles , as Homer has done, or Virgil of Æ neas , but all Achilles's Actions. 11\. Or the Incidents which happened in a certain space of time .] A certain Sign that the greatest part of the Poets were deceived about Epick Poem; and that they hardly distinguished it from History, is, that there have been as many sorts of Epopoeia, as there are different ways of writing History. The first is that which relates all that happened to one Man only; such is the History of Quintus Cartius . The Poets have also made Epick Poems of the Life of one Man, as the Achilleid , the Theseid , the Heracleid ,  &c. The second sort of History is that which takes for its Subject all that fell out, in such a certain time, as in that of Polybius . We have no Poem of this Nature, but 'tis probable by this Passage, that Aristotle had seen some. To conclude, the third sort of History is that which describes one only, and entire Action, which hath different Parts; as the History of Salust , which gives us the Jugurthine War, or Cataline's Conspiracy: And 'tis this last sort of History that Lucan, Silius Italicus, Valerius Flaccus , and those who writ the Cypriacks , and the Little Iliad , have imitated in their Poems. 12\. And such is the Conduct of the Poet who made the Cypriacks.] Aristotle has already mentioned the Cypriacks , in the seventeenth Chapter, and attributed them to Diceogenes ; some say, that this we now speak of, is different from the other; that this is an Epopoeia, and that a Tragedy. This is certainly grounded on his calling this Poem in the seventeenth Chapter, ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , Cypria ; and here he calls it, ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , Cypriaca ; but this is no consequence since this Poem which he calls ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif)  , Cypriaca ; is quoted by the Ancients by the Name of ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , Cypria , as Herodotus Atheneus , who cites some Verses of it which are perfectly fine. We know not the Subject of this Poem; all that appears, is, by a Passage in the second Book of Herodotus , where he speaks of the Rape of Helena . I believe that this Author had collected the most extraordinary Accidents which had been caused by Love, and called it Cypriacks , as if we should say Cypriack or Love Adventures , for Venus was the Goddess of Cyprus . And that which confirms me, in this Opinion is, that Neoevius an Ancient Latin Poet, made after this Model, a Poem of the same Nature, which he called Ilias Cypria , the Cyprians Iliad . Where he has all the Love Adventures which happened at the famous Siege of Troy. 13\. And of him who composed the little Iliad .] This little Iliad was a Poem which took in all the Trojan War; it begins thus. ![](/images/inline/sbIgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/OHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) . Dardanian, and the Trojan Wars I sing, Which to the Greeks such mighty damage brought. 'Tis called the Little Iliad , to distinguish it from Homer's , which was called the Great Iliad for the same reason: 'Tis surprizing, that that Iliad which treated only of one small part of the Trojan War, should be called the Great Iliad ; and that which comprehended it all, should be called the Little Iliad . He who writes Homer's Life (supposed to be Herodotus ) pretends that that great Author writ them both. Aristotle is not of this mind: Homer had too great a Genius, and too well understood the Rules of Art, to make a Poem of this Nature. 14\. Thus we see, that neither Homer's Ilia's nor Odysses, can furnish but one Subject for Tragedy, or two at most .] To shew that Homer had taken a different Rule from the rest of the Poets who may be called Historical, and that he took one simple Action for his Subject; he says, that if we consider the Plan of his Fable, we shall find in each of his Poems, but one Subject for Tragedy, or two at most; and truly there is nothing in the Plan of the Ilia's , but may be very well put into a Tragedy, if we shorten the time. All the Grecian Princes, tho' independent of one another, were united against the Trojans. Agamemnon whom they had made their Chief, insults Achilles , who was the most Valiant of all the Confederates: That Prince being offended, retires and refuses to fight: This Misunderstanding gave a great Advantage to the Enemies. Achilles suffers his Friend Patroclus to assist the Allies on a very pressing occasion: That Friend is killed by Hector , his Death inspires Achilles with a very eager desire of Revenge, and inclines him to be reconciled to Agamemnon ; he goes then to Battle, re-establishes the Affairs of the Greeks , gains a Victory for them, and revenges his Friends Death, by killing Hector with his own Hand. Here is nothing but what may enter into a Tragedy; and in dividing the Matter, we may easily find two Subjects for a Fable; for I can bring on the Stage only the first part of the Fable; that Ambition and Discord ruines not only the People, but the Princes also who are divided. Thus I should only treat of the Quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon , and the dismal effects of it, in ruining the Grecian Affairs, and causing the Death of Patroclus . I can also make another Tragedy on the second part of the Fable, which shews that when a Misunderstanding is removed, a good Intelligence re-established, what that Discord had ruined. 'Tis the same in the Odysses . A Prince is absent from his Country, the Lords of that Country taking the opportunity of his Absence, commit great Disorders, lay Snares for his Son, and would oblige his Wife to chuse one of them for an Husband. During these Transactions the Prince comes home, kills his Enemies and restores Peace and Tranquillity to his Kingdom. This is the Subject of the Odysses , which can make also two Subjects for Tragedy, by taking for one the first part of the Fable: That the Absence of a Prince doth infallibly cause Mischiefs in the State; and for the second, the happy Effects of his Return. This I take to be what Aristotle meant. The Ilias and the Odysses , can furnish each of them but one or two Subjects for Tragedy; that's to say, when they are stript of their Episodes; for if we take these Poems with their Episodes, they will afford a great many. 15\. Whereas a great many may be taken from the Cypriacks, and the little Iliad will afford more than eight .] For there was no principal and chief Fable in those two Poems. They treated of several Independent Actions, ev'ry one of which, might afford a Subject for Tragedy. 'Tis the same with the Achilleide of Statius. 16\. As the Judgment of Arms.] Æschylus made a Tragedy on the Dispute between Ulysses and Ajax , for Achilles's Armour: Pacuvius and Accius brought it on the Roman Stage. The Ajax of Sophocles , is only a Sequel of the same Subject. 17\. The Philoctetes.] This Subject has been handled by Æ schylus, Sophocles , and Euripides . We have only Sophocles's Tragedy. 18\. Neoptolemus .] 'Twould be difficult to determine what part of the Story of Neoptolemus , he took for the Subject of this Piece. 19\. Eurypilus .] There were two Captains of this Name, at the Siege of Troy , one the Son of Evoemon of Thessaly , who brought forty Ships to that Siege, and the other the Son of Telephus King of Mysia . The Tragedy which Aristotle speaks of, was made on the first, for 'tis without doubt that which a Latin Poet Translated afterwards, and is quoted by Cicero , in the second Book of his Tusculane Questions; but we don't know the Subject of it. 20\. The Beggar .] This was the Subject of a Tragedy: Ulysses put on the Habit of a Beggar, and went into Troy , where he killed a great many brave Trojans , and returned again to the Grecian Camp, without being known by any Body but Helen. Homer relates this Story in the fourth Book of his Odysses. Euripides speaks of it also in his Hecuba , but adds something of his own; for he says, that Helen discovered him to Hecuba , and that she being moved by his Tears, suffer'd him to escape. This deserved the Censure of the Scholiast, who has reason to blame him, for having imagined a thing so improbable and unlikely. And what appearance is there, that Priam's Wife would let go a Spy, and so considerable an Enemy as Ulysses was, when she had him in her Power? 21\. Helena .] The Greek says, The Lacedemonian ; that is, Helena, Helena Lacoena. Aristotle cites these Pieces by their true Names, so that 'tis easie to see that he doth not speak of that Tragedy which Euripides left under the Name of Helena : Besides the Subject of Euripides Piece, was not taken from the Little Iliad . For what likelihood is there that the Author of this Poem, should imagine that Paris carried away a Phantome instead of Helen ? Those who will take the Pains to read the false Dictys of Crete , who has without doubt enrich'd his Work with many things that he has taken from this Poem, will find a great many Particularities of Helen's Life, enough to furnish out the Subject of a Tragedy. 22\. The taking of Troy.] We must remember that Aristotle does not speak here of regular Pieces that comprehend one Action only. This Tragedy was made on the burning of Troy ; and 'tis probable, that Nero took from this Piece all that he sang, when he set Rome on Fire, that he might the better represent the Horrible Sight which the Poet had described. 23\. The Return of the Greeks.] This Piece is lost: 'Tis the same of which we have spoken in the seventeenth Chapter, and which Aristotle calls the Iliad , or the Return of the Greeks. It contained the Sacrifice of Polyxena , whom the Greeks Sacrificed on Achilles's Tomb, to get them a free Passage into Greece , as they had been forced to Sacrifice Iphigenia to open a way to Troy. 24\. Sinon.] Sinon having on set purpose been taken by the Trojans , tells them that the Greeks would have sacrificed him, but that he was escaped from the Altar, he pretends to tell them all the Secrets of the party he had deserted from, and by his fraudulent and artificial Discourse perswaded 'em to receive the Wooden Horse into their Walls. Virgil relates this Story at length, in the second Book of his Æ neids , and perhaps he took it from the Poem called the Little Iliad , and of which we are now speaking. 25\. The Troades.] The Subject of this Piece, which is among those of Euripides , is the distribution of the Trojan Slaves, and the Death of Astyenax , who was thrown headlong from a Tower. The different sorts of Epick Poem, the Parts of it, the same as those of Tragedy. The Character of the Iliad, and Odysses. The bounds of the length of an Epick Poem, and why it may be longer than a Tragedy. What Verse is most proper for it. What sort of Poem Cheremon's Centaur is. Elogy of Homer. He hath introduced nothing, that has not Manners. The Wonderful of an Epick Poem, goes as far as Extravagance, and why it does: An Example taken from Homer, how that Poet taught the others to Romance as they ought to do. A Paralogism which he used. The Impossible in some Cases, ought to be preferr'd to the Possible. All the Incidents of a Poem, ought to have their Causes and Reasons, and what must be done, if that be impossible . Sophocles's Fault in his Electra, and the Play of the Mysians. How an Absurdity may be admitted . Homer disguises his Absurdities admirable well. The meanest Parts require all the Ornaments of Diction. Place where these Ornaments of Diction are useless and vicious. 1\. There must necessarily be as many sorts of Epopoeia, as there are of Tragedy; for Epopoeia should be Simple, or Implex; Moral, or Pathetick: The Epopoeia has also the same Parts as Tragedy, except the Musick, and the Decoration, for it hath its Peripeties, Remembrances, and Passions. Moreover the Sentiments  318 ought to be as fine as the Diction: Homer was the first who mixed all these in his Poetry, and has done it with a great deal of Prudence and Judgment. 2\. And truly if we examine narrowly his two Poems, we shall find, that the Ilia's are Simple and Pathetick, and the Odysses Implex and Moral; for there are Remembrances quite thro' it; and the Morality is plain, from the beginning to the end, and he is so far from neglecting 319 the Sentiments and the Diction, that he excels all the other Poets. 3\. Epopoeia differs then from Tragedy, only in the length, and the Verse, 'twould be needless to give any other Bounds to it, than what we have already spoken of. It's sufficient if we can have the beginning and end under one View, and that would be done, without doubt, if the Plans were laid shorter than those of the Ancients, and so ordered, that the Recitation of an Epick Poem should take up no more time than the Representation of the different sorts of Tragedy which are Acted in one Day. 4\. Epopoeia has this Property, That it may be of a much larger extent than Tragedy; for this cannot imitate several things which are Transacted at the same time, it must necessarily be included in the narrow Bounds of a Theatre, and a certain number of Actors; whereas Epick Poem, which is only a Narration, may easily shew several things which are done at the same time, and in different Places, and which being proper to the Subject, give this Poem such an Extent, that the other cannot have. And this is so considerable an Advantage, that the Poet may by its means, add to the Grandeur and Majesty of his Verse, lead his Reader into a wonderful Variety of Adventures, and Diversifie his Work, by a great many different Episodes, which Tragedy cannot do, where the Resemblance, which never fails of producing, Offence and Disgust, is the most usual Cause of their ill Success. 5\. As for what regards the Verse of Epopoeia, Experience shews, that the Heroick is the only one that agrees with it; for if any should attempt to make 320 an Epick Poem, in any other sort of Verse,  321 'twould be without any Beauty, and would not succeed ; for as Heroick Verse, is the most  322 Grave and Pompous, so it  323 has a particular way of admitting strange Words, and Metaphors, 2nd that Imitation which consists in Narration, uses them much more than all the others. The Iambick and Tetrameter Verses are proper to give Motion; for the Tetrameter is good for Dancing, and the Iambick for Action; but 'twould be more Ridiculous to mix them altogether, as Cheremon has done; wherefore no Body has undertaken to make a long  324 Poem in any other sort of Verse than Hexameter, Nature it self having ( us hath been already said ) taught how to make a just Division, and to give it what is convenient for it. 6\. Homer deserves to be commended for many others; but above all, for being the only Poet, who knew exactly what he ought to do.  325 The Poet ought to say little himself, for in that he is not an Imitator. All the other Poets imitate but rarely, and don't push their Imitation  326 far enough; whereas Homer says little himself, but introduces presently some of his Persons, a Man, or a Woman, or something else that has Manners: for every thing in his Poem has Manners. 7\. The Marvellous ought to be  327 in Tragedy, but much more in Epopoeia, in which it goes even to the  328 Extravagant: For as we don't see in Epopoeia the Persons who Act, whatever passes the bonds of Reason, is proper to produce the Wonderful, and Admirable. For Example: What Homer says of Hector when he was pursued by Achilles , would seem Ridiculous on the Stage: for who could forbear Laughing to see the Grecians on one side standing still, without any Motion, and on the other Achilles pursuing Hector , and making Signs to his Troops. But this does not appear so in Epopoeia. For the Marvellous is always agreeable, and a Proof of it is, That those who relate any thing generally, add something to the Truth, that it may the better please those who hear it. 8\. Homer is the Man who hath given the best Instructions to other Poets how to  329 tell Lyes agreeably, and that is properly a Paralogism; for as all Men are naturally perswaded, that where such a thing is, or is done, such another must happen, we may easily make them believe, that if the last is, the first must consequently be. But beside, the latter, which we lay down for Truth being often false, the first is oftener so; and truly it does not follow, that because one thing is, another must necessarily be; but because we are perswaded of the truth of the latter, we conclude falsely, that the former is also true. 9\. The Poet ought rather to chuse Impossibilities, provided they have a Resemblance to the Truth, than the Possible, which are  330 Incredible with all their Possibility. 10\. He should also endeavour to admit nothing unto his Subject which has not its Cause; and if that be absolutely impossible, then that which is unreasonable, must be out of the Subject as in Oedipus , the Ignorance of that Prince, concerning the Manner of Laius's Death. That should  331 not be seen in that which appears on the Stage, and makes the Body of the Action, as in the Electra , where one enters to inform them of Orestes's Death, who wus killed at 332 the Pythian Games. And as in the Mysians , where we see a Messenger, who comes from Tegea to Mysia , without saying one Word. 11\. It deserves to be Laugh'd at, only 333 to say that this Exactness will destroy the Fables; for all Efforts imaginable ought to be made to form the Subject rightly from the beginning; and if it be done in such a manner, that some of these Places which appear absurd, cannot be avoided, they must be admitted, especially if they contribute to render the rest more probable. 12\.  334 In the Odysses, the place where Ulysses is exposed on the Shore of Ithaca , by the Pheoces , is so full of these Absurdities, that they would be intolerable, if a bad Poet had given us them. But that  335 great Man has hid them under an Infinity of admirable things, with which he has sprinkled all that part of his Poem, and which are as so many Charms, to hinder our perceiving that defect. 13\. Thus ought we to reserve all the  336 Ornaments of the Diction, for these weak places parts: Those that have either good Sentiments, or Manners, have no occasion for them. A Brillant, or Glorious Expression, damages them rather, and serves only to hide their Beauty. 1\. There must necessarily be as many sorts of Epopoeia, as there are of Tragedy; for Epopoeia should be Simple or Implex, Moral or Pathetick .] Since Epopoeia is the Imitation of an Action, as well as Tragedy, it must of necessity have one of these four Conditions, and be either Simple or Implex, Moral or Pathetick; for no Action can be imagined, which has not one of these Characters. See what has been remark'd on the twentieth Chapter. 2\. The Epopoeia has also the same Parts as Tragedy, except the Musick, and the Decoration .] Epopoeia like a Tragedy, hath Fable, Diction, Manners, Sentiments, Remembrances, Peripeties and Passions: That's to say, Wounds, Violent Deaths, Pains, Griefs,  &c. It hath neither Decoration nor Musick, because it imitates by Recitation only. 3\. Homer was the first, who mix'd all these in his Poetry, and has done it with a great deal of Prudence and Judgment .] This Expression of Aristotle seems to me, worth taking notice of; he says, That Homer used both first, and aptly , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which includes two great Commendations, viz . that of Invention, and that of Perfection, which are rarely found together, for never any thing was ever invented and perfected at the same time. Nihil simul inventum, perfectumque est. Homer alone had this Happiness; he was the first that used all those Parts in his Poems, and did it aptly : That is, he used them a propos , and as they ought to be, for he hath admitted neither too few, nor too many, which is the just Perfection in all things. 4\. And truly if we examine his two Poems narrowly, we shall find, that the Ilia's is Simple and Pathetick, and the Odysses Implex and Moral .] There can be nothing more Judicious, than Homer's Management of these two Poems: The Ilia's , where Choler and Fury bear sway, is Simple and Pathetick: 'Tis Pathetick, because we see almost every where Deaths and Wounds: 'Tis Simple, because it has neither Peripetie, nor Remembrance. Two Captains of the same side Quarrel, who after they had suffered much by their Division, are reconciled again; one of these revenges the Death of his Friend on his Murderer, and kills him with his own Hand. There's nothing here but what is Simple. Some say there are Peripeties in the Ilia's, because Affairs often change their Face, and sometimes the Greeks , sometimes the Trojans are Conquerors: But that which falls out according to the ordinary Course of the World, is never called a Peripetie; for if so, there would be a Peripetie in all sorts of Accidents. The Odysses is Implex and Moral, because it is a more sedate, and slow Poem, as being made for a Model of Wisdom, Moderation, and Constancy; for it hath many Peripeties and Remembrances, and the Heroe of the Poem is an Example of Virtue. But it may be objected, That the Odysses is also Pathetick, since Ulysses's Companions are lost, that he himself suffers innumerable Evils, and at last kills his Enemies. How comes it then that Aristotle found the Pathetick in the Ilia's only? This is easily answered. Aristotle quotes these two Poems, only in respect to what is the principal, and most essential in them: Simplicity and Passion, are the two Characters of the Ilias , for they reign from one end of it to the other; he for this Reason therefore, calls it Simple and Pathetick; and tho' this Poem has a Moral Instruction, as well as the Odysses , yet he doth not call it Moral, because the Morality is less frequent and more bidden. The Peripeties, Remembrances, and Morality, are the Essential Characters of the Odysses ; wherefore Aristotle calls it Implex and Moral, and tho' it contains Murders, and Violent Deaths, yet he calls it not Pathetick, because those Deaths take up a very small part of the Poem, and are found rather in the Episodes, than in the principal Action. Virgil in his Æ neids , has imitated these two Poems; he has taken both the Simplicity of the the Iliad , and Morality of the Odysses : The Æ neid is Simple as the Iliad , it hath neither Peripetie nor Remembrance; or if there are Peripeties, they are out of the Action, they are in the Episodes, and 'tis Moral, as the Odysses ; for the heroe of the Æ ineid , as him of the odysses, is an Heroe in Morality, and sets forth to Monarchs and Rulers, a perfect Model of all Virtues. This is surely the Sence of the Passage. Longinus has also laid down these two different Characters of the Ilia's and Odysses , as well as Aristotle , and hath also given the reason, when he says in his eighth Chapter, ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ἦ ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  ; When great Poets and Writers cannot teach the Pathetick they descend to the Moral ; for he endeavours to prove that Homer composed the Iliad , when his Ingenuity was vigorous, and Wit sprightly, and that he made his Odysses when he grew Old. This Difference of the Characters was so well known, that those who made it their Business to recite these two Poems in publick, represented the Iliad in a Scarlet Robe, by reason of the Bloodshed contain'd in it; and the Odysses , in a Sea Green, because of the Voyages it is filled with. 5\. He is so far from neglecting the Sentiments and the Diction, that he excels all the other Poets .] Aristotle has told us already, That Homer is the only Poet that has employed the four sorts of Epopoeia, in his two Poems, and he has also given him the Preference in the Constitution of his Fable, for the Manners, the Peripeties, Remembrances, and the Passion. There remain only the Sentiments and the Diction; and he avouches here, That he surpasses all the other Poets in these two also; and certainly nothing equals the Strength and Sweetness of Homer's Diction: He animates even that which has no Life, and gives Action to that which is most uncapable of Motion. The Sentiments answer to the Beauty of the Expression, and we may say of Homer , that he has the justest, and most exact Idea's of any Man in the World, and knows how to inspire his Reader with whatever he pleases. The Praises which so great a Critick as Aristotle gives to this Poet, will be always a sufficient defence against all the foolish Insults that can be made on him. 6\. Epopoeia differs then from Tragedy only in the length, and the Verse .] For Tragedy makes use of Iambicks, and Epopoeia of Hexameters: Tragedy is confined to one Day, but Epopoeia is not so limited. 7\. ' Twould be needless, to give any other bounds to it; that what we have already spoken of, is sufficient, if we can have the beginning and end under one View ] Tho' Epopoeia be more extended by its Episodes than a Tragedy, yet there is the same Rule for the length of those Poems; both of them must come under one View, so that the Memory may easily retain them; for if we lose the Idea of the Beginning, before we come to the End, 'tis a certain Sign that the Poem is too long, and this length destroys all its Beauty. See the Remarks on the seventh Chapter. 8\. And that would be done without doubt, if the Plays were laid shorter than those of the Ancients .] Aristotle is not satisfied to give us the Rule only, but the means also of putting it into Practice: And says, That to obtain the just Extent which Epopoeia requires, the Plans ought to be shorter than those of the Ancient Poets, who made the Cypriacks and the Little Ilias , and had embarrassed the Matter; for the Subjects of these Poems could never be brought under one View; but as this Precept was not nice enough, the Philosopher adds a second, which denotes the Bounds of Epopoeia a little more exactly: He adds, And so ordered, that the Recitation of an Epick Poem, should take up no more time, than the Representation of the different sorts of Tragedy which are Acted in one Day. Aristotle seeing the Athenians sit whole Days to see several Tragedies Acted, and that with Pleasure, without losing any of the Subject, had good reason to think that they were capable to comprehend and retain, without any difficulty, the Subject of any one Poem, whose Recitation should last no longer, than the Action of those different Plays. He bounds the Extent of Epopoeia to such a length; that is, he would have an Epick Poem to be read over in one Day, pretending that that which should transgress those Bounds would be too long, where the View would be confounded, and the Idea of the beginning lost, before we came to the End; and that which favours this Decision extreamly, is, that the Ilias , the Odysses , and the Æ neis , are exactly conformable to this Rule of Aristotle's . This is the meaning of a Passage whose Difficulties have been either passed by, or very little explained. Aristotle speaks here of the duration of the Poem only, and not of the duration of the Action, because there are no certain Rules for that, and it takes in more or less time according to the Action which it represents. If an Action is Violent, and full of Passion, it has less duration; for that which is violent, cannot endure long. For this Reason the Ilias which represents the Anger of Achilles , contains but seven and forty Days in all: But if it be a gentle Action, it may last as long as the Poet thinks fit, provided his Poem don't exceed the Measure which has been laid down. Thus Homer has given eight Years and an half to the duration of the Odysses ; and Virgil almost seven to his Æ neids. 9\. Epopoeia has this Property, that it may be of a much larger Extent than Tragedy, for this cannot imitate several things which are transacted at the same time, it must necessarily be included in the narrow Bounds of a Theatre, and a certain Number of Actors .] After he has shewn the Bounds of Epopoeia, he gives the reason why it may be more extensive than Tragedy, tho' it imitates but one Action only, and says very well, that it proceeds from the Epopoeia's making its Imitation by Recitation, which Tragedy doth not. Now the Narration gives the Poet an opportunity to represent several things which are transacted in several Places at the same time, and which are done by several Persons. Tragedy is deprived of this Privilege, and can comprehend only what actually passes on the Stage, and is executed by the Persons it introduces, and consequently neither can nor ought to be so extensive as Epopoeia. 10\. And which being proper to the Subject .] For Epopoeia is lengthned by its proper Episodes only; and uses nothing that is foreign, to enlarge it. 11\. And diversifie his Work by a great many different Episodes, which Tragedy cannot do, where the Resemblance, which never fails of causing Offence and Disgust, is the most usual Cause of their ill Success .] Narration gives an opportunity to the Poet to adorn Epopoeia with different Episodes, for having, as we may say, the whole World for his Stage, he may make as many Episodes as he pleases, and diversifie them in such a manner, that no two may be alike. 'Tis not so in Tragedy, that Imitates without the assistance of Narration, hath narrow Bounds, and short time, and consequently can have but few Episodes, or if it has many, they are so alike, that they infallibly displease. Aristotle saw many damn'd on this account, and we should see several served so in our Theaters, if we were as nice and delicate as the Athenians ; for we have Plays, in which all the Episodes are alike. 'Tis very difficult to avoid this Resemblance of the Episodes in the same Piece, since 'tis not easily shun'd in these which are made on far different Subjects. The Episodes are almost all of the same Nature, and we may put one for another, without changing the Action. 12\. As for what regards the Verse of the Epopoeia, Experience shews, that the Heroick is the only one that agrees with it .] 'Twas not Chance that found out this agreeableness, 'tis Nature, assisted by Experience and Custom. There were Poets before Homer , who wrote Heroick Poems in different sorts of Verse, mix'd together. That great Poet perceiving that these displeased, chiefly on the account of the odd Mixture of their Verse, which agreed neither with the Grandeur nor Majesty of Epopoeia, began to use only Hexameters, which is the most Serious and Pompous of them all: And for this Reason, Horace gives Homer the Honour of this Invention. Res gest ae Regumque, Ducumque, & tristia bella, Quo scribi possent numero, monstravit Homerus. Homer first taught us, how a Poet Sings, Of Wars, of Gods, of Captains, and of Kings. 13\. For the Heroick Verse, is the most Grave and Pompous.] The most Grave , the Greek says: The most Stable , because it is compounded of a Spondee, and a Dactyl, which have each of them two equal Times, and which are confin'd to their Feet, if we may so say; and for this Reason Horace calls them, Spond aeos Stabiles ; whereas the other Feet are unequal, as the Trochee, and Iambick. 14\. So it has a particular way of receiving strange Words and Metaphors .] This 'tis which makes the Pomp and Grandeur of Heroick Verse. 15\. And that Imitation which consists in Narration, uses them much more than all the others .] Writers have been much deceived by this Passage. Aristotle doth not say. That Epopoeia is the most Noble of all Imitations; for he was perswaded of the contrary, as will be seen in what follows. The Word ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif)  , which hath been Translated, The Most Noble , signifies also, The Most Excessive. Aristotle says Word for Word, This Imitation which consists in the Narration, is in that the Most Excessive of all . He gives the Reason why he says that the Heroick Verse is most agreeable to Epopoeia; that is, because it admits in a particular manner Metaphors, and foreign Words; and this is also the reason why Epopoeia makes a better use of all these sorts of Ornaments than any other Imitation, and employs a much greater Number of them: And this he proved, when he shew'd, that the double Words agreed with the Dithyrambicks, the Metaphors to Iambicks, the strange Words and Metaphors to Epick Poem. This latter proceeds on this Score even to excess, because it is more Pompous than the others, and uses more of the Sublime. 16\. The Iambick, and Tetrameter Verses, are proper to give Motion, for the Tetrameter is good for Dancing, and the Iambick for Action . Having shewn the Reason why Heroick Verse is the most agreeable to Epopoeia, he tells us for what Reasons, the others are not at all agreeable to it; ( viz .) because they are proper to give Motion, which is not agreeable to a Poem that ought to be Serious and Majestick. The Tetrameter Verse is composed of Trochees, which are proper for Dances only; and as he says in his Rhetorick, there is no Number more skipping and lively than it; wherefore 'tis not proper for Epopoeia. The Iambick Verse is good for another sort of Movement, for 'tis made to Act; wherefore Horace calls it, Natum rebus agendis ; and on that Account, it should be agreeable to Epopoeia, but 'tis too Mean and Low, and has too much of ordinary Conversation: It cannot then agree with Epopoeia, that admits nothing but what is Lofty and Grandiloquent. Aristotle has also shew'd us, That 'tis not proper for fine Prose, which requires something to heighten it, and to give it Majesty. 17\. But it would be more Ridiculous, to mix them altogether as Cheremon has done .] However contrary the other sotts of Verse may be to Epopoeia, yet Aristotle assures us, That an Epopoeia entirely composed of Iambick or Tetrameter Verses, would be more tollerable than that where those sort of Verses, were mixed with the Heroick, for nothing could be more Vitious than this Mixture, and the Heroicks which were mixed with them, would only serve to make the others appear more Ridiculous. 18\. Wherefore no Body has undertaken to make a long Poem in any other sort of Verse than the Hexameter.] Aristotle says, That from Homer's Time, down to his own, there was not one Poet who endeavoured to make a long Poem in any other sort of Verse then Hexameters; and this is what he told us in the first Chapter. Cheremon mixed several sorts of Verse in his Centaur , but as hath been already said, that Poem was not an Epopoeia, but a Tragedy, which is very short in respect to an Epick Poem; he had reson then to say, that an Epopoeia of many sorts of Verse, was an unheard of thing; and if this Mixture did not succeed in Tragedy, 'twould do it much less in Epopoeia. 19\. Nature it self having, as hath been already said, taught us, how to make a just Division, and to give it what is convenient for it .] He speaks here of the place of this Chapter, where he says, Experience shews us, that Heroick Verse only agrees with Epopoeia ; for 'tis Experience that helps us to unfold the Mysteries of Nature: And 'tis thus that Nature changed the Tetrameter Iambicks in Tragedy, into the Trimeter, which are more proper for it. 20\. Homer deserves to be commended for many others; but above all, for being the only Poet who knew exactly what he ought to do; the Poet ought to Say little himself, for in that he is not an Imitator .] This is another great Encomium , which Aristotle gives to Homer , in saying, That he was the only Poet who knew perfectly well what he ought to do . He saw on one side, that Epopoeia was different from Tragedy, in that it imitated by Narration; and on the other, that the Epick Fable should not be less active than the Dramatick; and knew that the way of reconciling these two, was to say little himself, but to make those he introduced Act, and speak very much. Epick Poem cannot subsist without Narration, since 'tis the Narration that gives its Form, and distinguishes it from Tragedy; but as Narration, properly speaking, is not an Imitation, or at most an imperfect one, an Epick Poem ought to be a true Imitation. He uses in his Poem only so much of the Narration, as is necessary to preserve its Form; and when he has said some small Matter himself, makes his Persons appear who are really Actors. This is what Aristotle , with good reason too, thought so praise worthy. Virgil knew perfectly well this Address of Homer , and made a wonderful use of it. 21\. All the other Poets imitate but rarely, and don't push their Imitation far enough .] The rest of the Poets follow'd a quite different Method from Homer , they spoke often and their Persons seldom, and therefore they imitate but little; Aristotle then had reason to say, that Homer was the only one who knew what he ought to do. 22\. But presently introduces some of his Persons, a Man or a Woman, or something else that has Manners, for ev'ry thing in his Poems has Manners.] Homer has not only made his Poem Dramatick, in making two Persons speak, Men and Women, Achilles, Agamemnon, Ulysses, Priam, Hector, Hecuba, Helena , but more so, by introducing some other things which have no Manners of themselves, but to which he gives them, either by making them enter into his Poem, under the Allegorical and Feigned Names of Gods and Goddesses, or in giving reason to that which has it not, as the Horie Xanthus , or Life and Passion to that which is Inanimate and Insensible, as when he calls a Rock Impudent , makes an Arrow impatient to strike , and Darts to thirst after Blood . Thus ev'ry thing in Homer's Poems has Manners, and by that he has kept the true Character of Fable, which should not admit any thing that has not Manners, Animals, the Elements, Plants, every thing hath Manners in Fable: This is what Homer has admirably well observed in his Epick Poems, and Virgil imitated most wonderfully in his Æ neids: Mezentius speaks to his Horse, addresses himself to his Lance as to a Person: Æ thon laments the Death of Pallas , so every thing hath Manners in the Æ neid , as well as in the Iliad and Odysses : This is in my Opinion, the true sence of this Passage, where Aristotle says, that Homer introduced nothing but what has Manners. 23\. The Marvellous, ought to be in Tragedy, but much more in Epopoeia, in which it goes even to the Extravagant .] Since Tragedy and Epopoeia imitate that which is more Excellent, they ought to expose only admirable and extraordinary Incidents: But as that which is contained in a Dramatick Poem, must be more probable than that which is in an Epick, where the Bounds of Veri-similitude are larger, because we don't see those who Act, and ev'ry thing is out of the common Course of Affairs, and there's nothing but what is surprizing, so that the Wonderful may be pushed even beyond Reason. However we must not think that he advises the Poets to put things evidently false and impossible into Epopoeia, and give them an entire liberty to run to such an excess, as would plainly destroy the Probability, and offend our Reason. And as in Tragedy, the Probable exceeds the Admirable, without excluding it; so in Epopoeia, the Wonderful should excel the Probable, without destroying it; and that will be done, if the Poet has the Address, to prepare his Reader, and to lead him by a long train of things that depend on Miracle, and prevent him from perceiving the Cheat which is put upon him; such is the Management of Homer and Virgil . The reading of these two Poets, will sufficiently instruct us, how far the Wonderful may be carried, without becoming Ridiculous Virgil took not so large a Liberty as the Greek Poet; for that which was admirable in Homer's Time, was not so in Augustus's . A Poet must therefore accommodate his Fictions to the Genius, Customs and Manners of the People, among whom, and the Time in which he lives. 24\. For, as we don't see in Epopoeia, the Persons who Act, whatsoever passes the Bounds of Reason, is proper to produce the Wonderful and Admirable .] This is the only Reason that Aristotle gives for what he hath advanced: That Epopoeia may push the Wonderful even beyond Reason, and he takes it from the Nature of the Poem. In Epopoeia we don't see the Persons who Act, and understand their Adventures by Relation only, but we see them in Tragedy, and ev'ry thing is Transacted in View of the Spectators, so the unreasonable in Epopoeia is hid, because we don't see that which is described; for the Eyes are always more sure and faithful Judges than the Ears, and we are much more easily deceived by that which is told us, than by that we see, and this is what is observed in Tragedy, wherein whatever is too Cruel, Wonderful, or Incredible, should be removed from the Sight, and represented only by a true Narration. Horace says in his Art of Poetry. Non tamen intus, Digna geri promes in Scenam, multaque tolles Ex oculis, qu ae mox narret facundia praesens: Nec pueros Coram populo Medea trucidet, Aut Humana palain Coquat exta nefarius Atreus, Aut in avem Progne vertatur, Cadmus in anguem; Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi. Yet there are many things which should not come In View, nor pass beyond the Tiring-room; Which after in expressive Language told, Shall please the Audience more than to behold. Let not Medea shew her Cruel Rage, And cut her Childrens Throats upon the Stage. Nor Bloody Atreus his dire Feast prepare, Cadmus or Progne , in new Shape appear, To this a Snake's, t'other a Bird's doth wear. Whatever so incredible you show, Shocks my Belief, and straight does Nauseous grow. Since Tragedy receives into its Narration, the Wonderful, which surpasses Reason, 'tis evident that it may more conveniently be admitted into Epopoeia, which is only an Active Narration, and hath the Advantage of leading the Reader by an Infinity of Miracles, which would be Ridiculous, if they were exposed to View. Homer in the Odysses , relates how Ulysses's Ship was Metamorphosed into a Stone: And Virgil , how Æ neas's into Nymphs, and both succeed very well. This I take to be the true meaning of this Passage which was spoiled, by reading, ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  v in proportion , for ἄ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  without reason. 25\. For Example: What Homer says of Hector, when he was persued by Achilles, would seem ridiculous on the Stage; for who could forbear Laughing, to see the Grecians on one side standing still, and on the other Achilles pursuing Hector, and making Signs to his Troops; but this does not appear so in Epopoeia .] The Example which Aristotle has chosen to prove what he said, is taken from the twenty second Book of the Ilias , where Homer describes the Combat between Achilles and Hector . This latter fled from the Enemy, and ran round the Town, Achilles fearing, that the least Assistance of the Grecians , would sully the Glory of his Victory, makes Signs to the Troops not to move; so that we see on one side Hector who flies, and Achilles who pursues, and making Signs to his Troops not to move, that he might have the entire Honour of the Victory: On the other, the Soldiers with their Arms across, Idle Spectators, waiting the Issue of the Combat. Homer means by this, that all Humane Strength proceeds from the Gods; that their Courage is lost when they abandon them, and that their Assistance is far from dishonouring the Heroe they favour; that on the contrary it enhances the Glory, which the Aid of Men destroys. For this reason, Achilles who was Jealous of his Honour, forbad the Greeks to assist him; but he received that of Minerva with Pleasure, he boasts of that and tells Hector, Don't think to escape: 'Tis Pallas who makes you fall by my Hand . But however fine the Allegorical Sence, which Homer has hid under this Incident, may be, 'tis certain that it would displease, if it were seen on the Stage, and was transacted before our Eyes; for none would endure to see such a Valiant Man run away like a Coward. It succeeds in Epopoeia, because it is only a Narration, aud we don't see the Persons. This is what Aristotle calls, the unreasonable Wonderful , 'tis reasonable in one Sence, since the Poet put it in designedly, and with a perfect knowledge of the Nature of his Poem, which admits that which a Dramatick does not. 'Tis astonishing, that after such a formal Decision, Homer should be reproached with this very place, as a dishonour to his Poem: But may such a thing be put into an Epick Poem now? A pleasant Argument, as if Homer must become Ridiculous, because we dare not do it now. In Homer's Time 'twas the Custom to speak to the People in Fables and Allegories, but 'tis not so now; and consequently, if we would put any Allegory into a Poem, it must be under the Incidents which are most conform to our Manners, and this Virgil has nicely observed. He imitates the Combat of Achilles and Hector , in that between Æ neas and Turnus , but has changed all that was not according to the Customs of his Country, where Allegories, how simple soever they were, would not be received. Turnus flies from Æ neas , but not till the Sword which he had taken instead of his own, unfortunately broke, they no sooner gave him his own, but he returns to the Fight, and faces his Enemy; you may see the rest in the same place of Virgil , who doth admit the Allegory, but under such things as may be understood simply, and without any other Mystery, and this we may do now. 26\. Now the Marvellous is always agreeable .] The Agreeable it inseparable from the Marvellous, of what Nature soever it be, and this proceeds from the Inclination Men naturally have to know something new. There's nothing newer than that which is Wonderful; and consequently there is nothing more agreeable; this gave occasion to the invention of Fables, which are always the first things that excite the Natural Inclination Men have of endeavouring to know ev'ry thing. What is a Fable? 'Tis a new Story not of something that is, but of something quite contrary. That which is new, and unknown, is agreeable, and stirs up our Curiosity. To which, if we add the Prodigious and the Wonderful, it makes it perfectly agreeable, and gives a Pleasure beyond compare. 27\. And a certain proof of it is, that those who relate any thing, generally add something to the Truth, that it may the better please those who hear it .] And truly nothing demonstrates better that the Wonderful is always agreeable, than the Application they use, who in relating any thing, endeavour to set off the Truth: This 'tis which produces Fables, and which caused the first Historians, as Hecat aeus, Herodotus, Ephorus , and the first Natural Philosophers; as Xenophanes, Parmenides, Empedocles , to mix Fable with their Works, ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , says Strabo ; as Homer mixed the Truth with his Fables, to render them the more probable and useful; these Writers mixed Fables with the Truth, to make it the more Wonderful, and consequently more Agreeable. 28\. Homer is the Man who hath given the best Instructions to other Poets how to tell Lies agreeably.] Aristotle doth not speak here of the Mixture which Homer has made of Truth and Falsehood, in the Plan of his Poem; who when he had disposed the Fable which is a pure Lye, had made the Episodes of Incidents, which he took from a true History; which made Horace say, Atque ita mentitur, sic veris falsa remiscet. Thus he tells Lies, and mixes them with Truth. As hath been explained on the 19th Chapter, but he speaks also of those particular Falsehoods, which he hath used in adorning the Truth, and which Horace call Speciosa Miracula; Plausible, Agreeable Miracles ; and truly in all his Fictions, which appear most extraordinary and Wonderful, there is always some Truth, which he disguises after his Manner, that it may give the more Pleasure; for as Strabo has very well remark'd, ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . 'Tis Homer's way, to joyn some Truth with his Fictions . Therefore he compares him to Ulysses , who talking to Penelope , as if he were Idomeneus's Brother, relates an History, in which he mixes Truth with Falsehood. ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/PSgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  . He told her Lies, yet made them seem like Truth. He made them probable, by the Mixture of some Truth: This is the Character of Homer , what he says of the Cyclops , the Lestrygones , the Cimmerians, Charybdis, Scylla, Æolus , &c. are Homer's Lies, but such as have some mixture of Truth, which serves for a foundation to render them in some sort probable; and 'tis thus that Polybius , and after him Strabo , refuted the Opinion of Eratosthenes , who asserted, That all that Homer Writ, was only frivolous Lies without any Truth, and said, that we should find the place to which Ulysses was carried, when we knew him who sew'd up the Sack, in which the Winds were inclosed. 29\. And that is properly a Paralogism, for as all Men are naturally perswaded, that where such a thing is, or is done, such another must happen, we may easily make them believe, that if the last is, the first must consequently be.] Homer teaches the other Poets to tell Lies as they should do. These Words, as they should do , denotes the Me thod which should be observed in making these Lies; and that Method consists in making use of false Reasonings, or of Paralogisms , which Aristotle calls ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) &rbetigr; ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , which is to prove a thing by the Consequence; as if when we would prove a Man to be in Love, we are contented to say he is Pale. The first Philosophers have observed, that the long Experience Men had had of some things following consequentially from others, perswaded them that they would always happen after the same manner, and knew that they could easily draw the Means of deceiving them from that natural Perswasion, and that too as much as they pleased, in giving probable Signs for certain Causes; and truly they are perswaded continually of the Truth of that which is most Absurd, and receive what is told them as true effects of the first, which are oftentimes as false as the others, for there are two ways of using this Paralogism : The first is when a false thing is infer'd from a true one; the other when a false thing is used, to make another pass, which is a necessary consequence of it. Homer is full of these Turns. Thus he makes us receive the Fables of the Cyclops, Scylla and Charybdis , which he has changed into hideous Monsters; of the Lestrygones , who carry on their Shoulders Men on a String, as Fish, and eat them, & c . This is, in my Opinion, the Sense of this Passage, which was very dark and obscure. 30\. And truly it does not follow, that because one thing is, another must necessarily be, but because we are perswaded of the truth of the latter, we conclude falsely, that the former is also true.] Homer knew that all Men were convinced, that all things were possible to God: And 'tis on this that he undertakes to perswade us, That Achilles's Horse spake, because the Goddess Minerva , had given him the use of Voice. This is a Paralogism: For as Aristotle rightly takes notice, that because one is, it does not follow, that the other must be. Homer understood how to make use of our Prepossession to his purposes, to make us receive somewhat that was false, without being able to convince our selves that it was so. And this was the Manner in which Aristotle says, a Poet ought to lye. Victorius says, that after Aristotle's Words, there are in some Manuscripts, ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Ngk.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  An Example of this is in the Place of the Odysses, where Ulysses's Feet are mark'd . If this be Aristotle's Text, he refers the Reader to the same Example, which he quotes in the Third Book of his Rhetorick, where speaking of the same Paralogism, which is made by that which is known, we draw Consequences and Conjectures, for that which is not known; and cites these Verses of the nineteenth Book of the Odysses , where Homer , to render his Story probable, by a simple and natural Circumstance, which is the Consequence of a Passion, says, ![](/images/inline/Ggk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  . And with her Hands the Old Nurse hid her Face, Then shed warm Tears \--- For those who Weep, generally hide their Face with their Hands, and Homer would by that Sign perswade his Reader, that it is no less false than the rest. 'Tis more likely that 'twas an Observation of some Critick, who had Writ in the Margin, that this Example of a Paralogism, was found in this Place of Homer , as Aristotle had said in his Rhetorick. 31\. The Poet ought rather to chuse Impossibilities, provided they have a resemblance of the Truth, than the Possible, which are Incredible with all their Possibility .] This Passage is of great Importance, to shew us, that the Wonderful in Epopoeia, tho' it transcends the bounds of Reason, ought not to destroy the Veri-similitude; and Aristotle says very well, That the Poets ought to prefer the Impossible, which is probable to the Possible that is not so. The Ilias, Odysses , and Æ neis , are full of things that are humanely speaking Impossible, and yet they continue to be Probable. There are two sorts of these Impossibilities, that are within the Bounds of Probability: The first, which may be called the Great and Incredible, are those which require all the Divine Veri-similitude; as the Horse which speaks in the Ilias , the Metamorphosis of Ulysses's Ship into a Rock in the Odysses ; that of Æ neas's Ships, into so many Nymphs in the Æ neid . These ought not to be too frequent in a Poem, least they be abused. The others are those, which tho' they are Impossible, are humanely speaking Probable, either of themselves, or by the Credulity of those, to whom they are told. 'Tis by this last way that Homer has brought into Humane Probability those things which are not so; as the History of Circe and the Syrens, Scylla, Polyphemus , and many others, for he hath so ordered it, that Ulysses tells these Stories to the Pheaces , who were a Foolish, Simple, and a Credulous People, very Idle, and loved dearly to hear such Stories. That Poet designedly gave the Character of those People, when he said, That they dwell far from any place where there were Men of Judgment , ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Sgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/isubgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , Odysses 4\. but as that Probability, which is taken from the Simplicity of those People, cannot acquit the Poet from keeping another sort of Probability in those Fables for the Learned and Rational Readers; he foresaw that; and with exact Address, hides Physical, or Moral Truths under the Allegories, and by that Method reduces to Poetical Verisimilitude and Truth, all those Wonders which Horace calls Speciosa Miracula, Specious Miracles. 32\. He should endeavour also to admit nothing into his Subject, which has not its Cause, and if that be Impossible, then that which is unreasonable must be out of the Subject, as in Oedipus, the Ignorance of that Prince concerning the manner of Laius's Death .] This is the same Precept which he gave for Tragedy in the fifteenth Chapter. ' Tis absolutely necessary, that in all the Incidents which compose the Fable, there be nothing without Reason, or if that is Impossible, it must be so ordered, that that which is without Reason be found out of the Tragedy, as Sophocles has prudently observed in his Oedipus. There were great Absurdities in the History of that Prince; for what likelihood was there that he could be so long ignorant of the Manner of Laius's Death? Was it possible that he should be Married twenty Years to Jocasta , and neither of them make the least Search after the Murder of that Prince? This was utterly incredible, and contrary to all Sence and Reason; but Sophocles finding it received in the Story, and that 'twas Marvellous, for the Theater, took the Subject of his Play from thence, and disposed it in such a manner, that what is unreasonable, is out of the Action, which doth not begin till the last Day of the Plague which afflicted the Thebans ; and 'tis this Judicious Management which Aristotle proposes to those who make Epick Poems. 33\. That should not be seen in that which appears on the Stage, and makes the Body of the Action, as in the Electra, where one enters to inform them of Orestes's Death, who was killed at the Pythian Games] Sophocles was not so Prudent and Judicious in the Management of some other of his Pieces, as he was in Oedipus , for in his Electra , he was guilty of the very Fault that Aristotle here mentions, by putting in something that was Absurd, and which is the more Vicious, because he was the Author of it. In the second Scene of the second Act, he who brings the false News of Orestes's Death, says, That that Prince being at the celebrated meeting of the Grecians , to assist at the Pythian Games, won all the Prizes, but was kill'd in the Race of the Chariots. Aristotle thought this was Absurd, and out of all Reason, not because it was not probable, that Egisthus and Clytemnestra should not hear the News before the Arrival of those who brought Orestes's Ashes, for there were a thousand things which might hinder that; but because the Pythian Games were not Instituted till above five Years after Orestes was Dead, and this Falsehood ruined all the Probability of the Piece, of which it was the Foundation: Sophocles needed only have feigned as Æ schylus did, that he was killed some other way. Some say, in defence of that Poet, that such Anachronisms are allowed of in Poetry; and that Virgil has made as great; but beside, one's Absurdities not be sufficient to Justifie another's, there's a great difference between an Absurdity, in the very ground of a Fable, and one that is in an Episode only. It were to be wished, that they were in neither, but they are more excusable in the Episodes. Without doubt Sophocles thought his Audience did not know the Rise of those Games, or else he would have taken care not to have made such an Alteration in the Epocha; otherwise the Absurdity is admirably well hid, under the wonderful Charms which are in the Relation, but that don't Justifie him. 34\. And as in the Mysians, where we see one who comes from Tegea to Mysia, without saying one Word .] The Fault which Sophocles is guilty of in the Mysians , is greater, and more inexcusable than that in the Electra ; for nothing can be more ridiculous than to imagine, that a Man should go from ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbrgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , a Town of Arcadia in Mysia , without saying one Word during a Journey of several Days, as we are entirely ignorant of the Subject of that Piece, for 'tis not taken from the History of Telephus ; 'tis impossible to conceive what obliged Sophocles to let such an Absurdity be in his Fable. 35\. It deserves to be Laugh'd at only, to say that this exactness destroys the Fables, for all the Efforts imaginable ought to be made to form the Subject rightly from the beginning .] This is the same Objection that some of our Modern Poets make, when we talk to them of Rules; if such Rules as these, (say they) were to be observed, we should hardly find any Subject that was fit for the Stage, and the Players had as good give over Acting. This deserves only to be Laugh'd at, as Aristotle says; and truly these Rules can never spoil any thing, and are so far from destroying the Fables, that on the contrary, they serve to correct all that is Vicious in them, or to disguise them in such a manner, that they may appear more tolerable; but this is the Cry of Ignorance and Laziness, to find fault with that they don't know how to follow. This is what Aristotle condemns. He says, and with a great deal of reason, that when any thing Absurd is found in the Subject, all Efforts imaginable must be made so to form the Plan, that all that is without Reason, may appear out of the Action of a Poem; and as there are Subjects, in which 'tis impossible to prevent all Absurdities; he says, that it may be admitted, provided it makes the rest Probable, and is adorned by all the Ornaments it is capable of; this Sophocles did, to hide the Absurdity of the Relation of the Death of Orestes . The Example which Aristotle quotes from Homer , will make this Rule more plain and clear. 36\. In the Odysses the place where Ulysses is exposed on the Shore of Ithaca, by the Pheaces, is so full of these Absurdities, that they would be intolerable, if a bad Poet had given us them, but that great Man has hid them under an Infinity of admirable things ,  &c.] This is a notable Judgment. There is nothing in the Odysses that shocks Reason so much as the exposing of Ulysses on the Shore of Ithaca by the Pheaces . The Fact was thus, as 'tis in the thirteenth Book of the Odysses, Alcinous gave Ulysses a Ship to carry him back into his Countrey. He Embark'd in the Evening at Corfou , and in the Morning at Break of Day he arrived at Ithaca : The Pheaces took him Sleeping, went and carried him to the Shore in his Bed, placed it under an Olive-tree, out of the Road, with all the Presents Alcinous had made him, and went their way without Waking him. Aristotle had reason to say, that this was Absurd; for what probability is there that a Man so prudent as Ulysses , who saw himself alone in a Ship, at the Discretion of Strangers, and whose Mind was intent, upon his Arrival in his own dear Country, should Sleep so soundly, that he should be taken out of the Vessel, carried with all his Baggage, on Shore, and that they should set Sail and he never Wake? However Homer was not ashamed of that Absurdity, but not being able to omit it, he used it to make the rest Probable; for it was necessary that Ulysses should Land alone at Ithaca , in order to his being concealed: If he had been Waked, the Pheaces would have been obliged to follow him, which Ulysses could not have handsomly denied, nor safely accepted. Homer had no other way to unravel his Fable happily, but as we knew what was Absurd in this means, he takes this Method to hide it; he uses all his Wit and Address, and puts so many admirable things into that part of his Poem, that the Mind of the Reader is Inchanted, so that he can't perceive this Defect, and is so much lull'd Asleep as Ulysses was, that he knows no more than he did how he came there. That great Poet describes the Ceremony of Ulysses taking his leave of Alcinous , and his Queen Arete ; after that, he sets off the Swiftness of the Ship by two very fine Comparisons; then he gives us an exact Description of the Haven to which she came: This Description is accompanied with that of the Caue of the Nymphs which is near this Port, beside a Wood of Olives, which is so wonderful and full of Learning, that Porphyry of Tyre thought it worth his while to explain it by an excellent Commentary. When Homer perceives that the Mind of his Reader is, as it were, Drunk with these fine things, he takes an opportunity to send Ulysses ashore, and the Pheaces back again: All that Work takes up but eight Verses, which are followed by a fine Dialogue between Jupiter and Neptune . When this Dialogue is ended, we see Neptune : changing the Ship which carried Ulysses into a rock. This was done in the View of the Inhabitants of the Island of the Pheaces; Alcinous was astonished at the Prodigy, of which he would fain know the Cause, and endeavoured to appease the Fury of that Angry God by making a Sacrifice on the Shore, and offering twenty Bulls. Then he returns to Ulysses . who was left Asleep, now Wakes, and not knowing the Place where he was, because Minerva made all things appear otherwise than they were, complains of his Misfortunes, accuses the Pheaces of Perfidiousness; and to pass the better Judgment on them, looks over his Baggage, to see whether they had taken any thing away. Minerva then appears to him in the Shape of a Young Shepherd; Ulysses uses his ordinary Reservedness with her, & c , Thus this Absurdity which is found in the Fable, when 'tis examin'd alone, is hidden by the Beauties that surround it, and 'tis this the Poets ought to imitate: This is more adorned with Fictions, than any place of Homer , and whose Style is most wrought up, it signifies little to have this Account of it; Read it and you'll find that Homer is the greatest Charmer in the World. 37\. Thus ought we to reserve all the Ornaments of the Diction for these weak Places .] This Precept is of importance; and no less necessary for Orators than Poets, All those Places which are either Absurd or Weak, and that cannot maintain themselves, ought to be supported by all the Ornaments of the Diction; as Homer, Virgil, Demosthenes and Cicero have happily practised. 38\. Those that have either good Sentiments or Manners, have no occasion for them .] This is a good Saying. Those Places which have Beautiful Sentiments, have no occasion for the Ornaments of the Diction, because these Ornaments would only obscure them. A good Sentiment never appears better, than in a simple Style: These Places which express the Manners, have no occasion for them neither, because they are also found in Plainness, wherefore Hermogenes has said more than once. That those who Write Morally ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , and express the Manners in their Discourse, Write plainly ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , and without Art. 39\. A Brillant, or Glorious Expression; damages them rather, and serves only to hide their Beauty .] In the Infancy of Poetry they did not perceive this Truth, that the Ornaments of the Diction offended the Sentiments, and hid the Manners; for the first Poets were dazled by the Beauties of their Art, and Prodigal of them without any reserve, they were always florid, and never said any thing in a plain manner; and for this Reason there are scarce any Manners in their Pieces, and the Thoughts are so laded with the Ornaments of the Diction, that they hide them, so that they are not easily distinguished. The Poets who followed, perceiving this Fault, forsook that Elaborate Language, and kept to the usual and ordinary way of speaking: Thus Poesie and Eloquence had a different Taste, this was perfect at first, for the Ancient Orators sought only the Simplicity and the Truth; but it was afterwards corrupted, and employed only Lyes and Cheats, whereas Poetry was corrupted at first, and afterwards became sound. Eloquence has not yet recovered its first Purity, and Poetry is almost relaps'd into its first Distemper. We have few Tragedies where the Persons speak Politickly , to use Aristotle's Term, that's to say, simply and ordinarily. They endeavour to use all the Ornaments of Rhetorick, and are more Declamators than Actors; and from thence it proceeds, that there are so many false Lustres, and the Manners seldom well denoted; for there is nothing more contrary to the Manners and the Sentiments than a bombast and lofty Style, as Dionysius Halicarnasseus well remarks, ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . Objections which are made to the Poets, and Answers to those Objections. Why we must not Judge of Poetry, as we do of Politicks, and other Arts. The Defects in Poetry are of two Sorts; those which may, and those which may not be excused. The difference of the Heroes of Sophocles, and those of Euripides. How we may salve what Homer has said of the Gods. A Maxim of Xenophanes. What is Customary and of common use, must not be condemned A Maxim of Morality applied to Criticism. Justification of several Places of Homer, the unjust prejudice of those who censure him. The Manner of Zeuxis. An Inexcusable fault of Euripides in his Medea, and in his Orestes. 1\.  337 IF we would know the Number and Qualities of the common Places, from whence the Objections are drawn, that are made to the Poets, and the Answers which may be made to those Objections, we need only read this Chapter. 2\. Since a Poet is an Imitator as well as a Painter,  338 and a Statuary, it necessarily follows, that he imitates one of those three things, for he represents a Subject either as it was, or as it is; such as it is said to be, or such as it appears; or such as it ought to be  339 and to do that, he uses, either proper or forreign Words, or Metaphors,  340 or any of the other Manners of Diction, that the Poets have the liberty to employ. 3\. Moreover, we must remember that we should not judge of the 341 Excellency of Poetry as of Politicks, nor as of any other of the  342 Arts. 4\. There are two defects in Poetry, one that proceeds from it self, and the other which happens by Accident. When it chuses Subjects out of its reach and power, 'tis that which proceeds from it self; but when it chuses Subjects that are not above it, but Vitious, this is that which happens by Accident: As for Example, it represents an Horse, that removes his two right Feet at the same time. It may also offend against the Rules of all other Arts, as Medicine, Geography, & c . or treat of Impossibilities, but all these Defects of what Nature soever, do not proceed from it self. 5\. We must therefore draw from these Places the Answers which ought to be opposed to the Reproaches that are made to the Poets. First, The Poet is guilty of a Fault beyond Contradiction , if he advances these things, which are impossible according to the Rules of this Art. But this ceases to be a fault, when by those means he obtains the end which he proposed; for he has then found what he sought for. For Example, If he renders by it, that, or any other part of his Poem more astonishing or admirable; such is the place  343 in the Iliads , where Achilles pursues Hector. 6\. But when the Poet can obtain some end, and produce almost the same effect, without infringing the Rules of Art, then his Fault is no less pardonable, for he must avoid, as much as is possible, the falling into any Error. 7\. We must also strictly examine, whether the Fault which is in dispute, be against the Art of Poetry, or whether it be a Fault by any other Accident whatever. For the latter is of less moment, and we may more voluntarily excuse that Poet, who does not know that a Doe has Horns, than he who shall make a bad Imitation. 8\. Besides, the Poets are often blamed, that they follow not the Truth in the Characters which they form; but they shew, that they do form them, either as they are, or ought to be: And 'tis thus that Sophocles and Euripides answered their Censures, Sophocles in saying, That He made his Heroes as they ought to be: And Euripides , That He made them as they were. And thus we should answer to all these sorts of objections. 9\. But if we cannot answer one of these two ways, we must  344 have recourse to Fame, and demonstrate that she hath said so: 'Tis thus that we salve what Homer has said of the Gods; for it may very well be, that what he has said may be neither true, nor better after this manner; but he has followed that which was reported; and otherwise as Xenophon says, Who is sure that he knows the Truth of his Way. 10\. It happens some times that the Thing is no better than the Poet speaks it; for he relates it just at is: And thus it is that we answer the Criticism, which is made on the place of Homer, where he says, That the Troops of Diomede slept standing by their Pikes, which they had fixed in the Earth; for it was then the Custom of those People, as it now appears by what the Illyrians do at this Day. 11\. To know whether a Thing be well or ill done or spoken, we must not be satisfied to examine the Thing it self, to see whether it be good or ill, but we must also have respect to him who speaks, or acts, and to him to whom he addresses himself, and to consider well the Time, the Means, and the End: For several things which may appear Evil , may be done to procure a greater Good, or to avoid a greater Evil. 12\. We may also render a great many Criticisms of none effect, by the manner of expressing our selves: For Example, When that which is taken for a proper Word , may be Foreign, and have a quite different Signification. Thus when they blame Homer for saying impertinently, That the Plague first seized on the  345 Mules, we may say that the Word in this Passage, which they Translate it in this last sence, when he said of Dolon ,  346 That He was ill made, he speaks of his Face, and not of his Body, for when the  347 Candiotes would say, That a Man has a fine Face, They use a Word which is compounded of this which Homer uses . When the same Poet is accused of making them give pure Wine to the Ambassadors, which Agamemnon sent to Achilles , he may be justified by saying, That the Greek Word does not signifie  348 readily. 13\. We often justifie them also, by shewing that they speak Metaphorically; and thus 'tis that we salve all those Places of Homer, where he says, That all the Gods and Men Slept, except Jupiter: He puts All for the most part, for Many; when he says of Agamemnon , who being shut up in his Tent in the middle of his Camp, That He cast his Eyes on the Trojan Camp. To cast his Eyes, is a Metaphorical Term, which signifies in that place only Uoice of the Flutes and To conclude, When he says, in speaking of the Bear, that 'tis the Only Constellation, which Baths it self in the Ocean: The Only, that is to say, alone. 14\. It comes to pass sometimes that we answer solidly to the Censures of the Criticks , by only changing the Tone or Accent, and 'tis thus that Hippias of Thasos salved Homer on that place, where Jupiter sends a Dream to Agamemnon, for they accused him of making a Lye upon Jupiter, and that Accusation would have been very well grounded if it was true that Jupiter said, Let us grant him great Glory; but in changing the Accent, we find that he only commanded the Dream, to promise him that Glory, and this is very different. 15\. The same Hippias, after the same manner defends this Poet, in the passage where after having spoken of a dry Tree, he is accused of saying , That one part of that Tree was Corrupted by the Rain ; for he shews, that what was taken for a Pronoun, is a Negative Particle. and that Homer said, That the rain never Corrupted that Tree. 16\. There are a great many places salved by  350 the different Pointing; and tis this that justifies Empedocles, who was accused of Contradicting himself, in his Verses, where he has explained the Principles of things. 17\. Sometimes we have recourse to the Ambiguity, as in the Passage where Homer says , That the Night is more than two thirds parts, and that there yet remains one third; for this apparent Contradiction is reconciled, in explaining the Word  351 18\. The Authority of Custom is often used to defend the Poets, who shall for Example call Wine that is mixed with Water, Wine; and 'tis thus that we excuse the Expressions of Homer , who call, Tin Buskins, tho' they were made of Iron, and there was only a little Tin in the Soddering, and he calls the Workers in Tin, those who laboured in the Forging of Iron; and says, in speaking of Ganymede , That he Filled out Wine to the 352 by Metaphors. 19\. Whenever a Word seems to signifie something contrary to the Intention of the Poet, we should examine all the different Significations which the Word can have in the Passage, that is in dispute. For Example , In the place where Homer describes the Combat of Æ neas and Achilles , he says, That signifies that it could go no further, but was repelled; and the shortest way to explain those Places, is to take the Word in the quite contrary Sense from what it is generally used. 20\. It happens often, as Glaucon has very well taken notice, that the Criticks are prejudiced, and possessed of some things before they read the Poets; and being perswaded that their Opinion alone is reasonable, they condemn without any further Examination, whatsoever is contrary to that Opinion. 'Tis from this false prejudice, That the Criticism which is made an Homer upon the account of Icarius Penelope's Father was produced; for his Censurers being prepossessed, That Icarius was a Lacedemonian , blame the Poet for making Telemachus lodge at another place, and not his Grandfather's when he came to  353 Lacedemonia : But they must be silent before the Cephalionians , who assert, That Ulysses Married in their Country, and that his Father in Law was called Icadius, and not Icarius. So that what they take for a just Criticism, can only be Question. 21\. When the Poet is accused of saying in general any thing that is impossible, we must examine that Impossibility, either in respect to Poesie, or that which is better, or in respect to  354 Fame. In respect to the Poetry, for we show, that the probable impossible, ought to be preferr'd to the possible, which hath no verisimilitude, and which would not be believed, and 'tis thus that Zeuxis painted his Pieces. In respect to that which is better, for we see that a thing is most excellent and marvellous in this manner, and that the Originals ought always to surpass. Lastly, in respect to Fame  355 for we have proved that the Poet need only follow the common Opinion. All that appears absurd, may be also justified by these three ways, either by the Maxim we have already laid down, that it is probable, that a great many things happen against probability. 22\. As for these things which seem contrary to what has been said before, we must examine them as we do Objections in  356 Logick. That's to say we must enquire, Whether it be the same thing? Tend to the same end? And whether it be spoken in the same manner? It is also very convenient to consider, Whether he that speaks of himself, or whether he speaks upon the report of some Prudent and Wise Man. 23\. The just Criticisms to which no Answer can be given, are those where 'tis plain, that one place is unreasonable and absurd, and that another is bad; a Poet falls into the first Fault, when he has recourse without necessity to that which is without reason, and this is the Fault of Euripides in his Egoeus . He was guilty of the second, when he introduces for Example, a bad Character without any occasion , such is the Character of Menelaus in the Orestes of that Poet. 24\. The Objections then which are made to the Poets, may be reduced under five Heads: For they may be blamed for saying things which are either  357 impossible, or absurd, or bad, or which contradict one another, or are contrary to the Rules of Art and the  358 Answers which may be made to them, may be drawn from those places we have set down, and which are in all twelve. 1\. If we would know the Number and Qualities of the Common Places from whence the Objections are drawn that are made to the Poets, and the Answers which may be made to them, we need only read this Chapter.] Aristotle having done giving Rules for Tragedy and Epick Poem, had reason to think, that all his labour would be in vain, unless he should instruct those who read this Work, to answer to the Objections which certain Criticks might make against the Poets; for in his Time there were Censors who were not satisfied to condemn Poetry, as an unprofitable thing, or rather a vicious Imitation, which corrupted the Manners, and consequently was unworthy to amuse Men; but also made all their Efforts to divert People from the reading of it. If those Censors had been only inconsiderable People, as Protagoras or Ariphrades; Aristotle would not have given himself this trouble, but there were Men of extraordinary Merit, as Socrates and Plato , who had drawn almost all the Academicks on their side; 'twas necessary then, that Aristotle should furnish his Readers with Arms to fight against such dangerous Enemies: This is what he has done, in gathering together the Answers which had been made by learned Men, to most of these Objections, and adding some of his own Invention. The Answers serve very luckily against all the Reproaches which are cast on the Poets now in our Time, especially Homer . I should never have sought an occasion to speak of this; but since it comes so naturally in my way, I will relate some of their Criticisms, not so much to contradict them, as to shew, that if those Censors had read this Chapter, they would have seen themselves condemned. 2\. Since a Poet is an Imitator as well as a Painter, and a Statuary, it necessarily follows, that he imitates one of these things.] Aristotle establishes three common Places, which are as Magazines or Arsenals, from which we may draw all necessary Arms, for to repel the Attacks of the Adversaries, before he descends to the particular Answers which may be made to every Objection. The first regards the Subject of the Imitation which has three essential Differences. The second regards all the Changes which happen in the Diction, and all the Liberty the Poets use. The third regards the manner, he goes on to explain himself. 3\. For he represents a Subject either as it was, or as it is, or such as it is said to be, or such as it appears, or such as it ought to be .] This is the first common Place which regards the Subject. There can be none other than these three Differences thought of, so when the Objection is aimed at the Imitation, we must endeavour to answer it one of these three ways; and if that cannot be, 'tis unanswerable, and we must not seek to make any Excuse for it. Horace said, Aut Famam sequere, aut Convenientia singe . 'Tis necessary that the Poet search for the Resemblance or the Convenience, if he doth neither of these he is certainly guilty of a Fault. 4\. And to do that, he uses either proper, or Foreign Words, or Metaphors, or any of the other manners of Diction that the Poets have the Liberty to employ .] This is the second common Place, which regards the Means, for the Poets make their Imitations by the assistance of Verse; so when a Criticism shall be made on the Diction, we must see if we cannot answer it, by some of those Changes that are allowed in the Diction, and the great Liberty which is granted to the Poets. 5\. Moreover we must remember that we should not judge of the Excellence of Poetry, as of Politicks, nor of any other of the Arts .] This is the third common Place, which regards the Manner, in which the Poets make their Imitation. Aristotle wrote this particularly against Plato , who in his Books of a Republick , and those of the Laws , examines Poetry with respect to Politicks, and condemns it, when it is not conformable to the Rules which good Politicks gives for the Preservation of States, and the Welfare of the People. There is nothing more unjust. For as Aristotle says very well, we must not judge of Poetry as of Policy, nor as we judge of the other Arts; and truly as Policy is the Art of managing the People wisely; Medicine of preserving the Health, Logick of discerning the Truth from a Lye, and Rhetorick of perswading; they have all a different aim from Poetry, and so often as they arrive not at that aim, they commit inexcusable Faults, which produce them, and that cannot be imputed to any other Art. 'Tis not the same of Poesie, its Intention is to imitate, and the Faults which it is guilty of in not doing it well, are of two sorts, either Proper or Foreign; the Proper are those which it commits, in chusing Subjects above its power; and the Foreign are those into which it falls by chusing Vicious Subjects. The first are essential Defects, which are only pardonable in some particular Cases, as we shall see in what follows; and the others are not the fault of the Poetry, but the Poet, who offends not against his own, but some other Art; this is the sense of this Passage, and what follows, will make it yet plainer. 6\. When it chuses Subjects out of its reach and power, 'tis that which proceeds from it self .] There are no Faults that can be attributed to the Arts properly speaking, for they cannot err: Physick never kills the Patient, 'tis the Doctor. 'Tis the same in all other Arts, to accuse them of any such Faults, is to maintain, that the Art of Shooting makes a Man miss the Mark he aimed at. Since 'tis thus, when we say that such a thing is the defect of the Art, we mean that 'tis the fault of the Artist, who deviates from the Rules of his Art; a Poet then who offends against the Art of Poetry, is such an one as chuses Subjects which are not proportionable to his Capacity, for then 'tis impossible that he should succeed in his Imitation. For this reason Horace gives this fine Precept, at the beginning of his Art of Poetry. Sumite materiam, vestris, qui scribitis, aeiquum Viribus, & versate diu quid ferre recusant; Quid valeant humeri; cui lecta potenter erit res. Nec facundia deserit hunc, nec lucidus ordo. Be sure, all you that undertake to Write, To chuse a Subject for your Genius fit; Try long and often, what your Talents are; What is the Burthen which your Parts will bear; And where they'll suit; he that discerns with skill To chuse his Argument, and Subject well, Will never be to seek for Eloquence To dress, or Method to dispose his Sense. 7\. But when it chuses Subjects that are not above it but Vicious, this is that which happens by Accident. For Example, an Horse that removes his two right Feet at one time .] The Foreign Faults, and of which we should not accuse Poetry, are those which the Poets commit against some other Art than their own, and those are of less moment and more pardonable than the first: A Poet will not cease to be a good one, tho' in describing the Course of a Sprightly Horse he should make him move his two right Feet at the same time, 'tis a Fault, but not in Poetry. If the Poet would have consulted the Jockeys, or seen an Horse walk, or any other Animal that has four Feet, he would have seen, that none of them move two Feet of the same side, at the same time, but the right Fore-foot, and left one behind, or the left Fore-foot, and the right one behind, so that they bear up both Sides of their Bodies. A Poet ought indeed to know so much of all Arts, as not to offend against any of them; but if I was to chuse, I would rather have him that was guilty of some Faults of this Nature, than one that was too knowing, for nothing is more disagreeable, than a Poet who affects to shew an Universal Knowledge. 8\. It may offend against the Rules of all other Arts, as Physick .] For Example. Homer may be accused of committing a Fault against the Art of Physick, when he gives Wine to those who were dangerously wounded. But besides Atheneus's Justification of him in shewing, that the Frugality of the Greeks made them find a Sovereign Remedy in Wine, which our Intemperance causes us to lose; 'tis certain, that when he did offend against this and other Arts, as Anatomy, Astronomy, Geography ,  &c. he did not offend against the Art of Poetry. 9\. Or Treat of Impossible Things .] When the Poet advances things which can never be, he errs by Accident also; for his Fault happens by his Ignorance, of the Nature of the Thing he speaks of. 10\. We must therefore draw from these Places the Answers, which ought to be opposed to the Reproaches which are made to the Poets .] If the Objection be aimed at the Subject, we must examine these three Differences which he has established and shew, that the Poet hath imitated such a Thing as it was, or as it is, or as it should be. If it regards the Means, we must examine the Term the Poet made use of, and see whether it be proper or Foreign, or Metaphorical, or any other Ornament of Discourse, if it be protracted, substracted, or changed, and consider the Reasons the Poet might have to make use of that Expression rather then another. To conclude, If it be on the Manner, we must enquire if that which is blamed be a proper, or a foreign Fault, if it be contrary to the Art of Poetry or any other. 11\. First the Poet is guilty of a Fault beyond Contradiction, if he advances those things which are impossible, according to the Rules of his Art, but it ceaseth to be a Fault, when by those means he obtains the end which he proposed.] Aristotle begins with those Faults which may be committed against the Art of Poetry. He hath said already, that they consist in an ill choice of the Subject, by chusing them above their Capacity. All that is Absurd is such, and 'tis that which he here calls Impossible , for by the Word Impossible , he doth not mean that which can't happen according to the Course of Nature, since these sort of Faults are foreign, or by Accident, as hath been already shown. Impossible in this place, is that which he calls in the preceding Chapter ἄ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , Unreasonable, Absurd . Every Absurdity in the Imitation is a Fault of Poesie. Aristotle does not then only tell us here, on what Occasions the Faults which a Poet commits in this Art, may be excused, but also when they cease to be such: 'Tis only when the Poet by their means obtains the end which he had proposed to himself, that is to excite Wonder and Admiration, and such is the place in the Iliads where Achilles pursues Hector. 12\. If he renders by it, that, or any other part of his Poem more astonishing or admirable.] Aristotle tells us here, That the Unreasonable, which the Poets oftentimes put designedly into their Poems, is not always designed to render that place more wonderful where it is put, but they often use it to make some other Places which accompany or follow it seem more admirable, as Painters make use of Shades to give the greater Lustre to the bright parts of their Pictures. In that place of the Ilias where Hector is pursued by Achilles , all the Unreasonable which is put there, is only to render that place the more surprizing; but the Absurdity which is in Ulysses's being left asleep on the Coasts of Ithaca , serves only to make that which follows, the more astonishing. 13\. But when the Poet can obtain the same end, and produce almost all the same effects, without infringing the Rules of Art, his Fault is no less pardonable, for he must avoid as much as is possibly the falling into any Error .] As what he hath said of Absurdities ceasing to be Faults, if they are used to excite the greater Admiration, might cast the Poets into a dangerous Security, by preventing them from taking the strictest care to purge their Works from all that is Vicious or Absurd, under pretence that it would render some place more surprizing and admirable, he takes care to inform them, that 'tis not only better to obtain that end without any Fault, but that 'tis also better to do it, tho' not so well, for what is what he means by these Words, ἢ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἢ ἦ ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , more or less , which I have Translated almost , provided the Difference be not too great; 'tis better not to obtain his end so well, and cause less Admiration, then to be guilty of a Fault. This Judgment so worthy of its Author, serves to shew us, that those are the most wonderful and admirable Places, where Homer has violated the Rules of Art, either designedly or being forced to it by the disposition of his Fable. 14\. We must also strictly examine, whether the Fault that is in dispute, be against the Art of Poetry, or by any other Accident whatever .] Before we condemn a Poet, we should see whether he has offered against the Art of Poetry, or whether it be only an accidental Fault, let the Accident be of what nature soever, for a Poet, properly speaking, only offends when he imitates that Ill which the Art is capable of doing well, all the other Faults are trivial, and pardonable, and don't hinder him from being Excellent in his Art. 15\. And we may more voluntarily excuse that Poet, who does not know, that a Doe has Horns, than he who shall make a bad Imitation .] He hath already shew'd us by an Example, what these Faults are which may be committed against any other Art than that of Poetry, a Poet describes an Horse, that lifts up his two right Feet as he walks. This is another Example drawn from things that are prodigious, or impossible in Nature; a Poet represents a Doe that has Horns; this Fault is not in the Poetry, but proceeds from the Poets Ignorance of that truth, which all Naturalists have taken notice of, and which Aristotle endeavours to prove in the second Chapter of the eleventh Book of the Parts of Animals, ( viz .) that Nature doth not give Horns to Does. This is more pardonable, than if the Poet had made a Vicious Imitation; for then he wou'd have been deficient in his own Art. What Aristotle says here, may excuse Anacreon and Pindar , who have both of them made the Does Horned; but however inconsiderable such a Fault may be, 'tis better to omit it; if it is true, that Does have no Horns, how shall we excuse Callimachus , for falling into the same Error, after this Judicious Remark of Aristotle , whom he had certainly read; but without doubt he thought that the authority of Pindar and Anacreon , were sufficient to justifie him, and that a Herd of Does with Golden Horns, would set off an Hymn consecrated to Diana , much better than one of Stags, or else they had discovered in his time that Aristotle was deceived, and that Nature doth sometimes give Horns to the Does, as they say was seen in the last Age, in which a Doe was taken that had Horns, and the Head kept as a great Rarity. 16\. Besides the Poets are often blamed, that they follow not the Truth in the Characters which they form; but they show that they do form them either as they are, or as they ought to be .] He goes back to the Objections which regard the Subject, and teaches us how we may answer to them. If the Poets represent the finest things, as they are not ordinarily, they may be justified by saying, that they represent them not such as they are, but such as they ought to be; and follow more the verisimilitude than the necessity; and if they represent them with less Ornament, and not in so flattering a manner we excuse them by saying, that they represent them, not such as they ought to be, but such as they are, that they followed the Necessity more than the Probability, and kept closer to their Copies, than to the Originals. 17\. And 'tis thus that Sophocles and Euripides answer'd their Censurers , Sophocles in saying that he made his Heroes as they ought to be: And Euripides, that he made them as they were .] This is the Sence of the Passage, which in my Opinion is very remarkable, for it teaches us, that in the time of Sophocles and Euripides there were some who found fault with the first for flattering his principal Persons too much, and the latter for not doing it enough; and truly Sophocles endeavour'd to make his Imitations perfect by always following, rather what Nature could do, than what she did; whereas Euripides strove to render them like, consulting chiefly what Nature did, than what she could do. I believe that last way would agree best with Comedy, and the first with Tradegy and Epick Poem, which ought to imitate that which is most excellent. If Heinsius had comprehended the Beauty of this Passage and the Solidity of the Judgment, he would not have endeavoured to Correct it. 'Tis one of his worst Criticisms, and is as follows: And 'tis thus that Sophocles answer'd his Criticks, in saying, That he made the Women as they ought to be, and that Euripides, made them as they were . For says he, Sophocles represented the Women Honest and Vertuous, and Euripides made them bad. He founded this Opinion on the Reproach that was cast on Euripides for hating the Women, and truly he is one of the Poets that speaks the worst of them; but that did not hinder him from bringing some very good ones on the Stage, as Alceste, Iphigenia Andromache . We may say also that he flattered his Heroines more than he did his Heroes. Whereas Sophocles , hath flattered his Heroes more than his Heroines: As for Example, the Character of his Electra appears too severe, and he hath much augmented the Cruelty of Clytemnestra. 18\. But if we cannot answer one of these two ways, we must have recourse to Fame, and demonstrate that she hath said so .] If the Subject of the Imitation be neither such as it should be probably, or necessarily, then we must have recourse to Report, to see if the Poet has followed that; this is the use of those three Differences, which regard the Subject, and which he hath explained. For a Poet treats of it either as it is, or as it should be, or as 'tis said to be; that which cannot be salved by one of these Authorities, is a Fault. 19\. 'Tis thus we salve what Homer has said of the Gods; for it may very well be that what he has said, may be neither true, nor better after this manner; but he has followed that which was reported .] The Ancients blamed Homer for attributing all the Passions and Vices of Men to the Gods; for this Reason Plato banished him from his Commonwealth; and Pythagoras said, That he was cruelly tormented in Hell, for having said so many things Injurious to Divinity. Aristotle answers these Objections, and endeavours to defend Homer ; he says, That he followed Fame in what she had published concerning them; for Orpheus , and the other Poets who preceded him, gave the same account, and as we can't doubt but that he added something of his own, yet 'tis conformable to all the rest. Aristotle thought this was sufficient to excuse him, but there are several other Reasons to justifie him. It hath been already taken notice of, that in Homer's Time they spake to the People only in Allegories and Parables; all the Divinities which he introduces into his Poem are Allegorical, he speaks of them as a Divine, or a Natural, or as a Moral Poet. As a Theological Poet he says nothing of his Gods but what is good, and agreeable to them: But to accommodate them to the usual way of Humane speaking, he attributes to them the same Passions as the most Orthodox Theology doth, viz . Anger, Rage, Sadness, Vengeance, & c . altho' they are free from them. As a Natural Poet, he makes Natural Causes of his Gods, and gives them Manners, Discourses, and Actions conformable to the Natures of those things which these Divinities represent. As a Moral Poet, he makes Gods of our Virtues and Vices. If we take the pains to examine all that appears most Choquant in Homer , according to these several ways, we shall find, that he is blamed in vain, that he is very far from deserving any, but on the contrary is praise worthy. I add, that setting aside the Allegories, his Fictions are marvellous, and that we find in the Sacred Scriptures , Examples of such Expressions and Figures. This Agreeableness of Homer's to the Divine Writings , ought to make the Criticks a little more reserved in their Judgments, and modest in their Censures. 20\. For it may very well be, that what he has said, may be neither true, nor better, after this manner, but he has followed that which was reported.] Plato condemns these Fictions of Homer , because they were as he says, false, and that they might do a great deal of Prejudice to the Ignorant and Simple, in giving them Ideas Unworthy the Holiness and Majesty of the Gods. Aristotle passes by all this, and pretends to justifie Homer on his account of his saying only that which had been advanced before his Time; but he doth it in an indeterminate and very equivocal sort of way. It may very well be , says he, that which he says may be neither true nor better , [illeg.] He doth not say, It is , but only It may very well be ; and in this he speaks according to his Maxims, that is to say, like a Blind Philosopher, who believed that God did not concern himself with the Affairs of Mankind, and that Men had very little Knowledge of him. This Place is unworthy of Aristotle. 21\. And otherwise as Xenophanes said, Who is sure that he knows the Truth this way. ] This is the consequence of that Impious Opinion, we just now saw. God does not concern himself with Humane Affairs, and Men know so little of him, that in whatsoever manner they speak of him, they cannot be reprehended; and Aristotle calls to his Assistance, the Testimony of an Ancient Philosophical Divine, who had wrote some Verses of the Nature of the Gods. To prove that we could know nothing of them, and that if we found out any Truth, 'twas pure Chance, and we could not be certain of it. These are his Verses. ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ὔ ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  . ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ὄ ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ű ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) o ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  . Of Nature, and the Gods, none e're yet knew, Or ever shall, that which is plainly true; And if by Chance, he thinks h'as found it out, He knows it not, it still remains a Doubt. This is an impertinent and gross Error, and has no need of the Light of the true Religion to confute it; we need only have recourse to some of the Wise Heathen, who acknowledged, That the Godhead was so visible by his Works, and Providence, that he must be blind that could not see it, and insensible that should attribute any thing to him but what was Good and Just. Euripides said well, The Gods which commit Unjust, or Shameful Actions, are not Gods. Aristotle could without doubt have defended Homer much better, if he had pleased; but he was afraid of Injuring the Sect he had established, and fortifying those of Plato and the Academicks. 22\. It happens sometimes, that the Thing is no better than the Poet speaks it, for he relates it just as it is, and there it is that we answer the Criticism which is made on the Place of Homer, where he says, That the Troops of Diomede slept standing by their Pikes .] In the tenth Book of the Iliad, Agamemnon, Hector and Ulysses , go to wake Diomedes. Homer says, That they found him laid on an Oxe-Hide at the Door of his Tent, having under his Head a piece of Purple Cloth, his Soldiers were laid also on the Ground, resting on their Helmets, having fixed their Pikes in the Ground beside them. On this account Homer is blamed, of having a Design to give a fine Idea of the Valour of these Troops, and to shew that they were ready to fight Night or Day; but 'tis quite contrary, for the Pikes being fixed in the Ground, were not so ready at hand as if they had lain down by them. Aristotle enters into no further Examination of the Matter, but consents to the Criticks, That it might very well be that the way of keeping the Pikes so near them, was not so good as the other, but thinks 'tis enough to justifie Homer , that it was the Custom of these People, and which as yet remained among the Illyrians , who certainly took it from the Greeks. Eustathius writes, That the Greeks did not leave it off till a long time after that, and then on account of an Accident which happened thus; some of the Pikes fell in the Night-time on the Soldiers, and waked them by Surprize, which caused a general Alarm in the Camp; so they ordered that the Army should be no more exposed to these sort of Accidents. This Criticism is then not only unprofitable, but unjust, as all those will be, that are made on those things that depend purely on Custom, 'twas impossible that Homer should conform himself to succeeding Ages, but they ought to go back to the Customs of his Time. There was nothing more common then to see in those Days People talking together before they went to fight. Homer is full of these Examples; and 'tis but reasonable that we should do him the Justice to think, that he would not so often have mentioned if it had been contrary to the usage of his Time. 'Tis on this Custom that the Conversation of Glaucus and Diomede is founded, in the sixth Book of the Ilias . 'Tis true that it is long, and 'tis the length which offends our Criticks, who never lose sight of their own Age, and would have Homer and Virgil from the Manners and Customs of their Persons, according to ours; but if they had given themselves the trouble to have examined the Reasons of that length, 'tis probable they would not have been so much disgusted. Hospitality was in those Heroick Days more sacred than Parentage it self, and 'twas this which made Diomede give such a long Audience to Glaucus , who took him at first sight for his Host, with whom it was not lawful to fight: And Homer admirably well uses this Conjuncture, to make an agreeable stay after so many Battles as he had related, and to divert his Reader, by such a pleasant History as that of the Family of Sisyphus was: But this is not all, we ought to take notice with what Address and Management he inserts this long Discourse; 'tis not during the heat of a sharp Encounter, that had been wrong timed, and no Custom had been sufficient to excuse it, he places it after Hector was returned into Troy , and the Absence of that Formidable Enemy had given Diomede that leisure, which he could not have had without it, we need only read the Judicious Remark of Eustathius on this place, which I shall only Translate, without inserting the Greek Text: This Poet having sent such a dangerous Enemy as Hector out of the way, and made him retreat from the Throng, breaks off the heat of the Fight, and gives some respit to his Reader, in bringing him from the Disorder and Confusion of the Action, to the Security and Tranquility of an Historical Relation; for by that Happy Episode of Glaucus. He hath found the means of mixing several admirable things in his Poem, as Fables which contain charming Allegories, Histories, Genealogies, Sentences, Ancient Customs, and such like things that are agreeable, which diversifie his Poem, and which breaking as we may say, the Series of it, instructs us very agreeably . This is what Homer does, for by this he nicely praises Diomede and Hector ; for he shows us, That whilst Hector was in the Field, the Greek had no spare time; and that when he was retir'd, all the rest of the Trojans were not sufficient to employ Diomede , and that 'twas only Play to him; he gives his Reader some rest, by an Episode that is very agreeable, and well placed, and with which he also diversifies his Poem; but this the Criticks are not sensible of. They think they have done Wonders when they have drawn any Passage out of its place, and have without any proof assured us, that 'tis Ridiculous and Impertinent, as if it was not easie to disfigure the most admirable and excellent Places, by relating them alone, and without the Context which they ought to have. It may be objected, That tho' we may justifie Homer , yet we can't excuse the Manners of his Age; for 'tis Unnatural for Men to talk cooly together when they have their Swords drawn in order to Fight. 'Tis an Injust Prejudice which makes us prefer our own Customs to those of the Ancients, and perswades us that they are more agreeable to Nature, but more than this, the duration of the ancient Customs in their proper Countries, which the Commerce of Strangers was never able to corrupt, is an evident Sign that they were Natural, and who hath told us, that 'tis more Natural to fall to fighting at once, than to talk with our Enemies before we begin? The first may be more natural to Tygers and Lyons, but the last seems more natural to Men: And if we may judge of two People who have quite contrary Customs, I say that the most reserved would have the greatest Courage and Firmness, and the most Passionate a Rash Heat, and that they would make haste to put into execution that Anger which their Choler should inspire, for fear that it should vanish together with their Courage, if they did not make use of it in that very moment. 22\. To know whether a thing be well or ill done or spoken, we must not be satisfied to examine the thing it self, to see whether it be good or ill, but we must also have respect to him who speaks or acts .] There is an admirable Rule in Morality, which prohibits us from judging of other Mens Actions, because 'tis very difficult to know certainly whether they are bad; for there are a thousand things which are done designedly, for some unseen Advantage, and which tho' they appear Ridiculous, are very Wise and Solid when we look to the bottom of them. Aristotle had good reason to give the same Rule for Criticism, and that we should examine all the Circumstantials of a Subject, before we condemn it; for the Circumstances of Persons, Time, Place, Means, and the End, make such a change in things, that those which appear evil, when they are taken by themselves and in gross, become very good when they are examined in detail, and by the Particulars. 'Tis by such a discreet Conduct as this, that many Places of the Holy Scriptures themselves are to be justified, which being taken according to the Letter, would appear unworthy of the Sanctity of those Writings, and contrary to Justice and Truth. If there are such Places in the Sacred Writings, much more may we expect them in Profane ones; and therefore 'tis the more requisite to read them with the same Circumspection If we do so, all that appears at first sight defective in the Characters, which Homer has formed, and which has drawn on him the Censures of some Criticks, is not only regular, but wonderful, and the best Model that can be imitated. 23\. But we must also have respect to him who speaks or acts; and to him to whom he addresses himself .] For the Character of the Person who speaks, and of him to whom he speaks, makes that to be good which would not come well out of anothers Mouth, or if it were addressed to any Body else. 'Tis on this Account that the Stories which Ulysses told the Pheoces would appear foolish if they had been told to a more knowing or less ignorant People, but they are excellent and probable, according to the Character of these People, who were ignorant, and wild after Fables and Stories. 'Tis on this account also as the Author of the Treatise on Epick Poetry has well remarked, that we justifie all that is found amiss in the Fable of the Adultery of Mars and Venus , without having any recourse to the Natural or Moral Allegory, which may be hid under the Fable; and shew that Homer is not without excuse, for truly we must consider, that 'tis neither the Poet nor his Heroe, nor a Man of any Value that makes that Story; 'tis a Musician, and one that Sings during the Festival, to a soft and effeminate People, as the Pheoces were, and Homer would shew us by the Example of those Idle People, who know how to do nothing but Sing and Dance, Eat and Drink, that that Idle and Soft Carriage was the Source of Criminal Pleasures, and that those Persons, who lead such a Life, are generally pleased to hear immodest Stories, and to see the Gods made Partakers of their Lusts: From whence we may conclude, that this Relation of Homer's is less an Example of Adultery and Impiety, than of good Advice which he gives to them, who would live Honestly, by insinuating, that if they would avoid those Crimes, they should also avoid the Paths which lead to them. If Scaliger had made this Reflexion, he had not been guilty of this false Criticism. Demodorus Deorum soeditates in Alcinoi canit convivio. Noster Jopas res Rege dignas . Demodorus sings the Lusts of the Gods, at the Feast of Alcinous, and Jopas things worthy of a King . The Songs of Demodorus are proportioned to the Natural Inclination and Relish of those to whom he sings them. And those of Jopas in Virgil , are such as should be for a Queen, who was as then Chaste, who had received Strangers to her Table, before whom she ought to shew all her Prudence and Modesty. But to shew that Virgil is no more reserved in this matter than Homer , see the fourth Book of the Georgicks , where he introduces a Nymph, who in the Court of the Cyrenian Goddess, sings to her Mistress who had only Nymphs about her, she sings, I say, the same Songs as Demodorus did. Inter quas Curam Clymene narrabat Inanem Vulcani, Martisque dolos, & dulcia furta: Atque chao densos Divum numerabat amores. To whom Clymene sang Vulcan's vain Care, The Crafty Tricks of Mars , and Sweetest Thefts, And th' Gods Amours e're since the World was made. If any of these two Poets is to be blamed, 'tis certainly Virgil , but neither of them deserve it, but are on the contrary praise worthy. Virgil understood very well what a Prudent Queen ought to hear before Strangers, and what Women might say when they were alone by themselves. And 'tis these Good Manners that the Poets should never violate. Servius might have convinced Scaliger , if he would have suffered himself to be guided by Reason more than his own Fancy. For this is the wise Remark of that learned Critick, on the singing of Jopas in the first Book of the Æ neids. Bene Philosophica inducitur Cantilena in Convivio Reginae: Adhuc castae contra, inter Nymphas ubi foeminae erant, ait Vulcani Martique Dolos. Philosophick Songs are very properly introduced at the Feasts of a Queen, who was as yet Chaste; on the contrary 'twas right to sing the Stories of Vulcan's Fears and Mars's Intrigues amongst the Nymphs, and when the Women were alone. 24\. And to consider well the time .] For the Conjuncture of the Time may render that good which would otherwise be evil, and 'tis this way that a great many Defects of the Ancient Poets are justified, which seem to be so when they are examined without any regard to the Time, or when they were Translated. 25\. The Means .] For the Means which the Poets use to obtain the unraveling of the Fable, are not sufficient to justifie that which appears extravagant, and extraordinary in the Characters which they have formed, and 'tis thus, That what the less Judicious Criticks find so Brutal, Cruel, and Capricious in Homer's Heroes, appears to the Wiser sort, not only Just and Regular, but what is most essential to the Character, and necessary to the Subject. The Brutality of Achilles , the Goodness and Piety of Æ neas , and the profound Dissimulation of Ulysses , may be the Subjects of Raillery among the Unlearned Criticks, but they will be always the Wonder of those who understand themselves. 26\. And the End .] The End may also serve very much to salve that, which seems too low in the Means which are used. This justifies Achilles in many Places, and excuses all the Humiliations of Ulysses. 27\. We may also render a great many Criticisms of none effect by the manner of expressing our selves; for Example, When that which is taken for a proper Word, may be foreign, and have a quite different signification .] Having told us how we may answer to the Objections which regard the Subject, and the manner of Imitation, he comes to those which regard the Means, that is to say the Diction. The Diction hath two parts, for it generally comprehends the Thoughts and the Expression Aristotle has told us more than once, that Homer has surpassed all the other Poets in the Art of Writing well, whether we look on the Expression, or the Thoughts and Sentiments, and that he has not only excelled the others, but that he has also done it to perfection, after a declaration of this Nature, he might easily dispence with following the Criticks in their wandering Steps, however he doth it, and tells us how we may refute all that Envy and Ignorance can invent against the Poets. The Answers which may be made to these Objections, are drawn from the richness of the Language which the Poets use. The following Examples will make this more plain. 28\. Thus when they blame Homer for saying impertinently, That the Plague first seized the Mules, we may say, That the Word in that Passage, &c .] In the first Book of the Ilias, Homer speaking of the Plague which Apollo sent into the Grecian Camp, says, ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) It seized first the Mules, and then the Dogs. The Criticks endeavoured to ridicule this: Apollo , say they, was angry with the Greeks , and amuses himself with first killing the Asses, Mules, and Dogs, who had been guilty of no Offence towards him. Aristotle answers to this impertinent Criticism, by saying, That this Word may be a Foreign, and not a Proper one: There is in the Greek , a proper Word ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which signifies a Mule , from a Word which signifies Mountains, but there is also a Foreign Word, which it sometimes uses, 'tis ' ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which comes from the Word o![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , of the Verb ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif)  , I see, I look out , and signifies a Guard, a Centinel. Homer uses that Word in the tenth Book of the Iliad , when Nestor demands of Agamemnon , ![](/images/inline/EEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἢ ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) Seek for a Leader, or some of the Guards. Aristotle says then, that in the Passage in dispute, the Word ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , taken in its proper signification, would be Nonsence, but before we condemn Homer , we should have recourse to the Foreign Signification, which makes it good; and certainly when Homer said that Apollo first slew the Guards , and the Dogs they had with them, is very reasonable, for they being exposed to the heat of the Sun, might first feel the Effects of that Contagion, before it was become general. But Aristotle does not assure us that Homer did make use of this Foreign Word, he only says it may be , because he says that the Poet might well enough be justified, tho' he made use of it as a proper Word; for the Beasts, and especially the Mules and the Dogs might by reason of their acute Smelling perceive the Infection of the Air, as all the Commentators on Homer have remarked. Again, That Poet might insinuate, That God, who loves Mankind, and always Punishes them with Regret, would give the Greeks some time to repent; wherefore he first smites those Creatures which are of greatest use to them, as the Mules and Dogs, the former of which carried their Baggage, and the latter kept Watch by Night. There is nothing here that can deserve Raillery, nay, which is not perfectly fine, since it is conformable to the Style of the Holy Scripture , the Plague was the first Stroke with which God afflicted the Egyptians ; and Moses thus speaks from God to Pharaoh. Behold my hand shall be on thy Fields, and thy Horses, and thy Asses, and Camels, and Oxen, and Sheep, a very grievous Plague , Exod. Chap. 9. 29\. When he said of Dolon, That he was ill made , he speaks of his Face, and not of his Body .] In the tenth Book of the Iliad, Homer says of Dolon , that he offer'd himself to Hector to go into the Grecian Camp by Night, to discover what was done there. ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ἂ ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) He was not Handsome, but was very Swift. The Criticks say, That Homer contradicted himself in this place, for 'tis impossible that a Man who is ill shaped, can have this Qualification. This Criticism was founded on the Word ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , being taken in the general usage of the Greek Tongue, for the Air of the whole Person, so that a Man who was well made was called ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  ; but Aristotle shews that the same Word was taken in Crete for the Face only, and the Man who had a fine one was called ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . For this reason Hesychius has set down ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ἔ ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , and perhaps ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif)  should be added. The Latin Word facies is as equivocal, as the Greek , ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , for it signifies both the Visage and the Air of the whole Person. 30\. When the same Poet is accused of making them give pure Wine to the Ambassadors, which Agamemnon sent to Achilles, he may be justify'd by saying, That the Greek Word does not signifie pure Wine , such as is given to Drunkards, but that it signifies readily. .] In the ninth Book of the Ilias, Agamemnon sends Ulysses, Ajax and Phoenix to appease Achilles ; who received these Ambassadors very kindly, and gave order to Patroclus . ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Zgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) .  . Menetius Son, the largest Bowls fill up With purest Wine, and give to each his Cup. Zoilus the Amphipolitane , says, that Homer is guilty of an unpardonable Indecency, in ordering pure Wine to be given to such Wise Men, which was used only to be drank by those who were Debauched and Drunken. In answer, we say, That the Word ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ,  , doth not signifie pure Wine, but readily , as Hesychius has explained it after Aristotle . It signifies also the hottest Wine, fullest of Spirits, and consequently the most excellent. Thus Achilles tells Patroclus , that he should get some of the best Wine, and mingle it with Water, according to their Custom, in a Vessel called Crater . We have reason to think, that he would have less Water mixed with it than ordinary, because his Heroes were fatigued with the Labour of that Day. Plutarch thought that this Question deserved an whole Chapter in his Table Discourses: See what he says in Chap. IV. of Book V. where he assents to the latter Explication. The Word ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif)  , which signifies to mix , infallibly denotes, that Water was mixed with the Wine. 31\. We often justifie them also, by shewing that they speak Metaphorically; and thus 'tis that we salve all those Places of Homer when we say , That all the Gods and Men Slept , except Jupiter.] Homer begins the second Book of his Ilias with these two Verses. ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ὖ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) . ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . The Gods and Men were then all fast Asleep. Great Jove alone, himself could waking keep. The Criticks pretend, that 'tis ridiculous to say. that Jupiter only was Awake in Heaven, and that it gave a very bad Idea of the Grecian Captains, to tell us that all their Army was Asleep. This was an Army well guarded (say they) when all the soldiers slept, but this Criticism is badly founded, for there is nothing more common not only in Verse, but in Prose too, to say the general Word All for the most part . Thus in the ninth Chapter of Exodus , it is said. That the Plague kill'd all the Beasts : And four Verses after he says, That the sixth Punishment of the Ashes, which immediately followed the Plague, covered the [illeg.]ores both of Man and Beast. Now 'tis plain by this last Passage, that the Word All in the first, is meant only of a great part. There is nothing more usual, yet notwithstanding this Remark of Aristotle, Scaliger , has fallen into this false Criticism of accusing Homer of a Lye, when he says in the eleventh Book of the Iliad , That all the Gods were angry with Jupiter for taking the part of the Trojans : "For 'tis false, says he, that all the Gods were angry, since there was half of them that were for Troy . Pitiful Invention!" 32\.

When to the Trojan Camp he cast his Eye, He saw the kindling Fires flame round the Town, He heard the Voice of Flutes, and Noise of Men; But when he saw his Troops, and view'd his Fleet, He tore his Hair, and Jove he thus invok'd. The Criticks ask how Agamemnon , who was shut up in his Tent in the middle of a well fortified Camp, could see what passed among the Trojans , and cast his Eyes on the Fleet; some would salve this Contradiction by saying, That he had a Tent in an eminent place, from whence he could see all that was transacted thereabouts; but this is founded on Conjecture only. Aristotle answers much better, in shewing, that to regard, to cast ones Eyes , are Metaphorical Terms, to think of, revolve in his Mind. Agamemnon when he was shut up in his Tent thought of all that he had seen before he went thither. The same Criticks blame Homer for having said in the same place, The Voices of the Flutes and Pipes ; for Voice is properly said of Men only; but Aristotle answers by saying, That 'tis put Metaphorically for the Sound , and there is nothing more admirable than the Metaphor, which is of wonderful use in the Sublime. 'Tis thus that David says, The Voice of thy Thunder , and the Prophet Nahum makes admirable use of the Description of the Destruction of Nineveh , a Description which is far exceeding all those of Profane Authors, both for its Energy and Vivacity: For he says in the third Chapter, The Shield of the Mighty Men is made red, the Valiant Men are in Scarlet, their Chariots shall be with flaming Torches in the Day of his Preparation, and the Firr-trees shall be sensibly shaken. The Chariots shall rage in the Streets, they shall Justle one against another, in the broad Ways: They shall seem like Torches, they shall run like the Lightnings. He shall recount his Worthies; they shall stumble in their Walk; they shall make haste to the Walls thereof, and the Defence shall be prepared. The Gates of the Rivers shall be opened, and the Palace shall be dissolved . Voice is not only attributed to things that cannot make a noise, but also to those which are Mute: Thus God blaming Cain for his Crime, says, The Voice of thy Brother's Blood, crieth to me from the Ground. 33\.

The same Verses are repeated in the fist Book of the Odysses . The Criticks have made use of this Passage, to prove, that Homer was entirely ignorant of Astronomy, since he believed, that the Bear was the only Constellation which was not bathed in the Ocean, that is to say, that did not set, and was always visible; for say they, this is common to other Constellations of the Arctick Circle, as the Little Bear , the Dragon , the Hand of Boores , and the greatest part of Cepheus . To salve Homer , we answer, That he says it is the only one, to shew, that 'tis the only one of the Constellations he had spoken of, or that he had put the Only , for the Principal, the most known. Strabo justifies this after another manner, in the beginnig of his first Book, see the entire Passage, which I have Translated, because it seemed to me very considerable. Vnder the Name of the Bear and the Chariot, Homer comprehends all the Artick Circle, for there being several other Stars in that Circle, which never Set, he could not say, That the Bear was the only one which did not bath it self in the Ocean; wherefore these are deceived who accuse the Poet of Ignorance, because he knew one Bear only, when there are two; for the Little one was not found out in his time. The Phenicians were the first who took notice of it, and made use of it in their Navigation, and the Figure of that Sign passed from them to the Greeks: The same thing happened in the Constellation of Berenices Hair, and that of Canopus, which was named Yesterday, or the Day before: And as Aratus says very well, there are several other Stars which have no Names . Crates was then in the wrong to endeavour to correct this Passage, in putting [illeg.] alone, for [illeg.] alone; for he would avoid that which there is no occasion to do . Heraclitus did better than he, for he put the Bear for the Artick Circle, as Homer has done: The Bear, says he, is the Bounds of the Rising and Setting of the Stars; 'tis evident then, that by the Word Bear, which he calls the Waggon, and which he says observes Orion, he understands the Artick Circle, that by the Ocean he means the Horizon, where the Stars Rise and Set, and by those Words, which turns to the same place, and doth not bath it self in the Ocean, he shews that the Artick Circle is the most Northern part of the Horizon ,  &c. 34\. It comes to pass sometimes, that we answer solidly to the Censures of the Criticks, by only changing the Tone or Accent; and 'tis thus that Hippias of Thasos, salved Homer on that place where Jupiter sends a Dream to Agamemnon, for they accuse him of making a Lye on Jupiter.] I have extended this Passage in the Translation, for it seems to be too short in the Original. Aristotle said only, and by the Accent, as Hippias of Thasos salved that Passage; Let us give him , but that brevity which was so well understood in the Days of Aristotle , when most Men knew Homer almost by Heart, would make a Riddle how that few would understand. I therefore thought it necessary to explain the Text it self, the Criticism which is here treated of, is in the second Book of the Iliad; Jupiter , who thought of nothing more than to enhance Achilles's Valour, sends a false Dream to Agamemnon , who orders him to make a general Assault on the Place, and promises him, as from Jupiter , good Success in the Order which the God gave to the Dream, there was one Verse in which he expressed himself in this manner, ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif)  , Let us give him great Glory . This Lye in the Mouth of Jupiter appeared horrible to the Ancients. Plato blames Homer , in the second Book of his Republick; but Hippius of Thasos salves that Poet, by shewing, that instead of ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ,  , Let us give , he writ it with an Accent on the Penultima , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , which is for ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  the Infinitive for the Imperative; and Jupiter said to the Dream, Give him, Promise him great Glory ; now 'tis not extraordinary to see a Lying Dream, and Jupiter who suffered Agamemnon to be deceived, was by no means guilty of Deceit. He permitted it without being the Author. The Holy Scriptures afford us a parallel Example in the History of King Ahab , when God would have him perish in Ramoth Gilead: And the Lord said, Who will perswade Ahab, that he may go up, and fall at Ramoth Gilead: And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. And there came forth a Spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will perswade him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a Lying Spirit in the Mouth of all his Prophets. And he said, Thou shalt perswade him and prevail also: Go forth, and do so . Nothing can be more like. The Jupiter of Homer , is no more a Lyer and Seducer in this Passage, than the true God is in the History of Ahab ; and Homer knew this Truth, That God uses the Malice of his Creatures to accomplish his Judgments, and we need only change one Accent in his Expression, to render it conform, if we dare say so, to the Holy Scripture. The Criticks who were terrified at the Impiety which they found in their Verse, and not knowing this Remark of Hippias , have taken the liberty to expunge it by a sort of Pious Fraud; 'tis not in the Greek Text at present. Aristotle speaks more at large of this Passage, in his Book de Elenchus Sophisticis. 35\. The same Hippias after the same manner defends this Poet in the Passage, where, after having spoken of a dry tree, he is accused of saying, That one part of that Tree was Corrupted by the Rain .] This Criticism is not so considerable as the former.

A Sapless Trunk of Oak or Pine there stood, A Cubits height, not putrified by Rain. Instead of the Negative[illeg.], which Homer uses, the Criticks read[illeg.], which is the Genitive of the Substantive Article, which ; and thus they make Homer fall into a manifest Contradiction; but Hippias shews us the Impertinence of these Censures, by establishing the Negative. 36\. There are a great many Places salved by the different Pointing, and this 'tis that justifies Empedocles, who was accused of contradicting himself in his Verses, where he has explained the Principles of Things .] There is an Infinity of Places in the Works of the Ancients, where a false Pointing spoils the Sense, and where consequently, we need only change the Point, to find that which is good or true. Aristotle quotes an Example, which he had taken from Empedocles Verses; but as that Example could not be Translated into our Language, in such a manner as we might discern the false Pointing, I have reserved it for Remarks. That Philosopher in a Treatise which he had Writ to prove that Love and Discord were the Principles of things said. ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ἴ ![](/images/inline/PSgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἶ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/Zgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) .

We see plainly that he would say the same thing twice; nevertheless, the second Verse would say the quite contrary to the first; but the Criticks ought to take notice, that to find the true Sense, the Point ought to be transposed to ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . ![](/images/inline/Zgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ἄ ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  And that which was before Compounded, becomes Simple. Quintilian hath spoken at large of this Vice in Chap. 9\. of Book VII. 37\. Sometimes we have recourse to the Ambiguity, as in the Passage where Homer says, That the Night was more than two thirds past, and that there yet remains one third .] In the tenth Book of the Ilias, Ulysses says to Diomede , with whom he was going into the Trojan Camd. ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ὄ ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) . ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) . Come let us on, the Night is almost gone, The Stars are Setting, and the Morn approaches. More than two Thirds of Night are past, and one alone Remains. The Criticks say, That one Third of the Night could not remain, when more than two thirds were spent. Aristotle says. That the Word more than , which causes the Ambiguity, ought to be understood in another sense, and that Homer said, That the greatest part of the Night was passed, that is to say, two Thirds . 'Twould be very difficult to render this intelligible in our Language. See what the Commentators say on it, for this Criticism is not of such Importance, as to oblige us to relate all that they have said concerning it. 38\. The Authority of Custom is often used to defend the Poets, who shall, for Example, call Wine that is mingled with Water, Wine .] There were Criticks ridiculous enough, to blame Homer for calling Wine mingled with Water, Wine ; that he said, Boots of Tin , for Boots of Iron; that he called those who forged Iron, Workmen in Brass ; and that he made Ganymede fill out Wine to the Gods, when they drank Nectar only. Aristotle says, That all these Expressions may be salved by the Metaphor, and that even without having recourse to that, we may justifie them by usage, which is the Tyrant of Languages, and gives no Reasons for its Decisions. There is another Custom that justifies certain ways of speaking, which extreamly offends some of our Criticks now a-days, who are a little too nice. Homer speaks often of Cauldrons, Kettles, Blood, Fat, Intestines, & c . We see the Princes themselves assist to flea the Beasts, and to help roast them. And because our Customs and Manners are different, and that all these things are done only in our Kitchins and Butcheries, that only Cooks and Butchers concern themselves with those mean Offices, Homer is ridicul'd. But how do we know but that for which he is blamed, is entirely conform to what is found in the Holy Scriptures , than which nothing is more august and venerable, and which will suffer no Railleries without Impiety. As that Knowing and Religious Man, the Author of the Treatise of Epick Poem, as well remarked, since the Works of Homer and Virgil , are not so full of them as the Holy Writings , and which are consequently exposed to the Railleries of Libertines and Atheists. In Homer, Agamemnon and the other Princes kill the Victims themselves, because it is the most August and Solemn act of Religion, and 'twas for this reason, that at Rome the Censors who were the Magistrates of the greatest Authority perform'd the same Office, and to shew the importance of it, they did it with a Crown on their Head, and cloathed with a Purple Robe. There is nothing then to blame Homer with, on that account, but they may say, who can endure to think, that Princes should get ready their own Victuals, and that Ulysses should brag of his being the best Cook in the World; that he knew better than any Body, how to cut up Food, serve Wine, make a Fire; and that Achilles should submit to the most ordinary Functions, in his own House? This Objection is no better than the others. Could Homer do better then to describe the Manners of those Times then, as they were? Both Holy and Profane History do equally teach us, that 'twas then the Custom to serve ones self, and that nothing was counted Shameful. And we ought the less to admire at what Homer says of the Manners of Achilles , who was a Thessalian ; for Thessaly loved most, and retained longest that Ancient Simplicity, for it preserved it, after most other Countries had lost it. A Greek Author who Wrote some Treatises of Manners in the Dorick Language, writes formally. 'Tis a becoming thing in Thessaly to dress ones own Horses and Mules, to kill Oxen, to flea them, and cut them out, altho' in Sicily 'tis shameful, and the Duty of a Servant only . The same Criticks read some Epithets in Homer , which they complain are flat and impertinent, because they would appear ridiculous, if they were literally Translated. He calls Juno, Boopis , that is, Juno with Oxe Eyes ; but that Epithet signifies only fine, which hath even fine Eyes , and is a customary Word. Achilles is call'd ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , swift of Foot ; Is this Epithet proper for a General or a great Commander? Yes without doubt, since David takes it to himself, and thanks God, that he had made his Feet as swift as an Harts Feet; Who hath made my Feet as the Feet of an Hart . There is no Epithet in the Holy Scripture more usual for Valiant Men. In the Lamentations which David made for the Deaths of Saul and Jonathan , he calls them, Swifter than Eagles , and stronger than Lions , II Kings 1\. 23. and some Valiant Men who came to David , are said to be as swift as the young Goats on the Mountains. Another great Scandal to these Censurers, are the Comparisons. Homer compares Ajax to an Ass , and Ulysses to Fat : Can any thing be more despicable or disgusting? Thus they pass their Judgments without any Examination or Formality; and those Comparisons which seem so flat and dull now, were then very fine and noble. In Homer's Time, Asses were not so despicable, as they are now; their Name was not then thought Scandalous, for Kings and Princes rode on them. So that Homer might well enough compare Ajax to one of those Animals; and none can laugh at the Comparison without Impiety, since God himself put it into Jacob's Mouth, when he Blessed his Children; Issachar is a strong Ass couching under his Burden ,  &c. The other Comparison of Ulysses to Fat, was yet more Noble, since it was taken from the Sacrifices which yielded Blood and Fat, things the most Holy and Venerable in those Days; and what is most unhappy for the Criticks, is, that 'tis found in the Holy Scripture, which begins David's Praises by that Comparison, David is like Fat without Flesh, and the rest of the Children of Israel are like Flesh without Fat , Ecclesiastic. 17. 2. Thus David compares the United Brethren to the Oil which was poured forth on Aaron's Head, which ran down to his Beard, yea even to the Skirts of his Cloathing. The Criticks might better employ their time, then to condemn that which is conform, to that which is most perfect, and which claims the Respects and Veneration of all Mankind; and let me tell them, that till they have formed their Judgment rightly, and acquired all the Knowledge that is necessary for to turn Criticks they will never be able either to praise or blame with Justice. 39\. Whenever a Word seems to signifie something contrary to the Intention of the Poet, we should examine all the different Significations which the Word can have in that Passage that is in dispute .] This is a wise Rule, and 'tis for want of observing it, that the Crittcks have fallen into such Absurdities as we find. In the twentieth Book of the Iliad where Homer describes the Combat of Æ neas and Achilles , he says, that Æ neas's Pike which had pierced the two first Folds of Achilles's Sheild, stopt at the third which was of Gold. ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbrgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) .  . The Criticks take the Word Stopt , to remain fixed, and blame Homer for saying so ridiculous a Thing, for a Pike is too long to remain fix'd in the Buckler, only Darts and Arrows could do that: But Aristotle discovers the ridiculousness of this Criticism by shewing, that the Word Stopt , had a quite contrary Signification; for it signifies, that it could go no further, and so was repelled. 40\. And the shortest way to explain these Places, is to take the Word in the quite contrary Sence from what it is generally used .] This Rule is of infinite more use in the Greek than the Latin ; for the Greek hath a great many Words, which have not only different, but contrary Significations. There is a place in Homer which has been explained in a wrong sense, for want of following this Rule. The Conversation of Glaucus and Diomede , ends by their exchanging their Arms; Diomede gives to Glaucus his made of Steel and finely polished, and Glaucus gives to Diomede his, which were of Gold, and ten times the value of the others; 'twas Diomede who proposed that Exchange on which Homer says, ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ὖ ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Ggk.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/KHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/etigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Zgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  And they construe it, Jupiter took away Glaucus's Prudence at that Moment , for making so unequal an Exchange, and giving Arms of Gold for those which were only plain Steel. This Sentiment is too mean for an Epick Poem. Homer could have spoke no otherwise if his Princes had been Merchants, and endeavoured to Cheat one another.

Still Gen'rous, and in Good excelling all, That no Disgrace might on his Fathers fall. 41\. It happens often as Glaucon has very well taken notice, that the Criticks are prejudiced and possessed of some things, before they read the Poets. And being perswaded, that their Opinion alone is reasonable, they condemn, without any further Examination, whatsoever is contrary to their Opinion .] Nothing can be better described, than these blind Criticks, who being prepossessed with certain Opinions, undertake to read the Poets, and condemn all that is not agreeable to their sense. Thus Eratesthenes being prepossessed, that Geography was very little known in Homer's Time, accuses him of speaking at random, and that he said nothing that was true; but Strabo has sufficiently answered him, by refuting all the Errors into which this unjust Prejudice had precipitated this Critick who was otherwise a very Ingenious Man; and in shewing that Homer was no less preferable to the other Poets upon the account of his skill in Geography, than for all his other Perfections. The Description of these Criticks very much resembles those of our own Time, who having it in their Head, that our Age in the only Rule of what is Fine and Good, condemn all that is not conform to it, and so fall into a thousand Absurdities. 41\. Glaucon.] Glaucon of Teos , who wrote a Treatise of Gesture and Pronunciation, Aristotle mentions it in his Rhetorick. 43\. 'Tis from this false Prejudice, that the Criticism which is made on Homer, upon the Account of Icarius Penelope's Father, was produced; for these Criticks being prepossessed that Icarius was a Lacedemonian.] The Criticks being prepossessed, that Icarius Penelope's Father was a Lacedemonian , accuse Homer of being guilty of a breach of good Manners, in making Telemachus , when he went to Lacedemon to enquire after his Father to go and lodge with Menelaus , rather than with his Grandfather Icarius . To this Censure Aristotle opposes an old Tradition of the Cephalonians , who say Icarius Penelope's Father, was of their Island. But we may answer this Objection better and more agreeably to History. 'Tis certain that Icarius Penelope's Father was of Lacedemon, Oebalus the Son of Perierus King of Lacedemon had three Sons, Tyndarus, Hippocoon , and Icarius. Hippocoon expelled his two Brothers, who retired to Thestius King of Pleuron , a Town of Etolia ; and assisted him in extending the Bounds of his Kingdom on those of Achelous. Thestius gave his Daughter Leda to Tyndarus , who returned into Laconia , after Hippocoon's and his Childrens Deaths, who were killed by Hercules. Icarius being possessed of some part of Acarnania by the Assistance of Thestius , Married Polycasta the Daughter of Lygeus , by whom he had Penelope , and five Sons, whose Names may be seen in Appollodorus . So that when Telemachus came to Laconia , he could not go to his Grandfathers, for he was in Arcanania ; but he went to Menelaus who had Married Tyndarus's Daughter, that is the Daughter of his Great Uncle. And a certain sign that Homer followed the Tradition, is, that in the fifteenth Book of the Odysses , when Minerva would have Telemachus go for Lacedem on , she appeared to him in a Dream, and tells him, That his Grandfather and his Uncle would oblige Penelope to Marry Eurymachus . ![](/images/inline/rbEEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  . ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) .  For this proves, that Icarius and his Children were in Arcanania , or Ithaca , and not at Lacedemon ; and if there was only this Verse left as a Proof, it were sufficient to destroy all the Pretensions of the Criticks. So Timocles a famous Athenian Poet, calls Telemachus an Arcananian , in his Bacchus , and in his Satyrical Piece against Icarius. 44\. When the Poet is accused of saying any thing in general that is impossible, we must examine that impossibility, either in respect to Poesie, or that which is better, or in respect to Fame.] Aristotle goes back to the Impossibilities and Absurdities which were taken notice of in the Ancient Poems, because he knew very well, that 'twas that which did most offend the Ignorant, and furnish them with Objections against his Works. He teaches us three ways how to justifie them, which I shall endeavour to make plain by Examples. 44\. In respect to Poesie: For we show that the probable impossible, ought to be prefer'd to the possible, which has no verisimilitude, and which would not be believed .] Poetry is a mixture of History and Fable, that is, Truth and Falsehood. The foundation is Historical, because the Poet doth not entirely neglect the Truth, the rest is Fabulous, because the naked Truth would not be surprizing enough, since the Admirable ought to excel, and especially in an Epick Poem. It follows from hence, that the impossible Verisimilitude, is more proper for Epopoeia , than the Possible, which being above the reach of Men, would be neither probable nor admirable: But it may be said, Why doth it not keep it self within the Bounds of the possible Probable, for otherwise it will not be a Poem. The Verisimilitude would be there, but the Admirable would not; there would be Truth but no Fable, and 'twould be taken rather for an Historical Relation, then for an Epopoeia , which ought to be avoided above all things. Petronius says, Non enim res gest ae versibus Comprehendendae sunt, quod longe melius Historici faciunt, sed per ambages Deorumque Ministeria, & fabulorum sententiarum Tormentum praecipitandus est Liber Spiritus, ut potius furentis animi. Vaticinatio appareat, quam religiosae orationis sub testibus fides. Actions are not to be treated of in Verse, the Historians will do that better, but a Poetick Spirit ought rather to run through those things which requires the Ministry of the Gods, that are Fabulous and Intricate, so that it may rather appear like the Prophecy of an Enthusiast, than the Faith of a Religious Discourse which is testified by Witnesses . Thus in respect to Poetry, that is to say, by the Nature of the Poem it self, are all the Impossibilities which are found in Homer to be salved, for we see what 'tis that Poem requires, that it goes even to the Unreasonable, provided it retains the Probable. But it may be asked, Whether the Trevits of Vulcan , which have a Motion, and go alone, be within the Bounds of Probability? And had not Julius Scaliger reason to laugh at it, and say, Tripodas fabricavit Vulcanus sponte Mobiles, quare non & lebetas fecit sponte Coquentes obsonia . Vulcan made Trevits which moved; Why did not he also make Kettles which would boil Food of themselves ? I dare say, That this Criticism proceeds from the want of being rightly instructed in the Nature of Epopoeia . But before we set to justifie Homer , we'll take a View of that Passage. In the nineteenth Book of the Iliad, Thetis going to Vulcan's , found that God at Work, he had made some Trevits, Under each of which he had placed Golden Wheels, that they might go of themselves to the Assembly of the Gods, and that they might return to his House again, which was wonderful to behold . ![](/images/inline/KHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ,  . ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/EEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) If Vulcan had made ordinary Trevits, they would not have been fit for a Poem, and had not answered the Greatness, Power, and Skill of a God. It was therefore necessary that his Work should be above that of Men: And for to effect that, the Trevits were animated in a manner, and in this Homer doth not run from the Probability; for there is no Body who is not fully perswaded that a God can do things more difficult than these, and that all Matter will obey him. What has not been said of the Statues of Dedalus? Plato Writes, That they walked alone, and if they had not taken care to tie them, they would have gotten loose and run from their Master. If a Writer in Prose can speak Hyperbolically of a Man to shew his Ingenuity, may not Homer do it much more of a God? I go still further, and say, That this Circumstance with which Homer has embellished his Poem, would have had nothing too surprizing tho' these Trevits had been made by a Man; For what may not be done by an exact Management of Springs? Don't they make in these Days Figures which go alone, which come down Stairs, and get into a Coach? This Criticism then is ill grounded, and Homer does not deserve the Ridicule they would cast on him. 46\. And 'tis thus, that Zeuxis painted his Pieces] Zeuxis prefer'd, as Homer did, the Impossible Probable to the Possible, which had no Verisimilitude, and for this reason 'tis, that Aristotle said elsewhere, That his Pieces were without Manners; for nothing hides the Manners so much as the Sublime and the Marvelous. 47\. In respect to that which is better, for we see that a thing is most excellent and marvellous in this manner, and that the Original ought always to surpass .] Thus we justifie that which appears Prodigious and Wonderful in the Characters which Homer has formed; the Ignorant condemn them, because they see nothing like them in the Works of Nature: but Homer has not wrought after these Copies, he followed the true Original, which is Nature it self, and a Spirit filled with the fruitful Ideas of the Universal Agent, brought forth those originals, which have the same advantage over ordinary Men, as Nature her self hath over those Beings which she hath produced, for the Originals should always excel the Copies. This way we also see the excellence of certain pretended Impossibilities which are condemned in the same Poet, as those Trevits of which I have spoken, which went alone, and that of all those different Figures which Vulcan graved on Achilles's Shield. The Description which Homer gives of it in the eighteenth Book of the Iliad , is one of the Prime Places of his Poem. It has been the Wonder of the most Polite and Knowing Ages, but that has not prevented some from Criticizing on it. Julius Scaliger is the first and only one who has appeared in this latter Age, but at present Hunc Tota armenta sequuntur . 'Tis impossible, say the Criticks, to represent the Movement of all these Figures, and in condemning the Manner, they take the Liberty to condemn also the Subject which they say is trivial, and not well understood. But I hope to make it appear, that there is something really frivolous in the Censure, and that they are infinitely deceived. We'll begin with the Manner. 'Tis certain that Homer speaks of the Figures on this Buckler, as if they were alive: And some of the Ancients taking his Expressions to the strictness of the Letter, did really believe that they were so, and that they used all sorts of Motion. Eustathius reprehended that Sentiment by a Passage of this Description. That Poet , says he, to show that his Figures are not animated, as some of the Ancients have pretended, without any necessity, by an excessive Affection for the Prodigious, took care to say that they moved and fought as living Men . The Ancients certainly founded this ridiculous Opinion on this Rule of Aristotle , for they thought that the Poet could not make his Description more Admirable and Marvellous, than in making his Figures animated, since the Originals should always excel the Copies. That Shield is the Work of a God. 'Tis the Original of which the Engraving and Painting of Men is but a Copy, and there is nothing impossible to the Gods: But they did not perceive, that by this Homer would have fallen into an extravagant Admirable , which would not have been probable. Thefore 'tis without any necessity that the same Eustathius adds. That 'tis possible all those Figures did not stick close to the Shield, but that they were off of it, and moved by Springs, in such a manner, that they appeared to have Motion, as Æschylus has feigned something like it, in his seven Captains against Thebes. The Passage of Æ schylus , which Eustathius means, is certainly that where he says, That Parthenopeus carried on his Shield the Chimera which was off from it, ἔ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . Without having any recourse to that Conjecture, we can show, that there is nothing more Simple and Natural, than the Description of that Sheild, and there is not one Word which Homer might not have said of it, if it had been the Work of a Man. For there is a great deal of difference between the Work and the Description of it. We'll examine a little more narrowly what Homer is blamed for. Homer , say they, has put two Towns which speak different Languages . 'Tis the Latin Translation, and not Homer which says so; the Word ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , is a common Epithet of Men, and which signifies only, That they have an articulate Voice . These Towns could not speak different Languages, since as the Ancients have remarked, they were Athens and Eleusina , both which spake the same Language, but tho' that Epithet should signifie, which spake two Languages , there would be nothing very surprizing: For Virgil said, what Homer durst not. If a Painter should put into one Painting one Town of France , and another of Flanders , might not one say, that they were two Towns which spake different Languages: But to proceed, Where we hear the Harangue of two Orators. Homer says not so, but only that two Men pleaded for a Wager, which one said he had paid, and the other denied that he had received . There is nothing here can be said of the Arts, hiding that which it ought to shew, as an Ancient has very well observed, in speaking of Painting, Ostendat qu ae occultat . Was not the same said of Nicomachus, That he had painted two Greeks, which spake one after another . Can we say otherwise of these two Arts, that tho' they are mute, yet they have a Language? Or in explaining a Painting of Raphael or Poussin , Can we prevent animating the Figures, in making them speak conformably to the Design of the Painter? But how could the Engraver represent these Young Shepherds and Lasses that Dance in a Ring, and then in Sets or Troops which were in Ambuscade? This would be very difficult if the Workman had not the liberty to make his Persons appear in different Circumstances. All the Objections against the Young Man who Sings at the same time he plays on the Harp; upon the Bull that roars whilst he is devoured by a Lion, and against Musical Consorts, are Childish, for we could never speak of Painting, if we should banish those Expressions. When Pliny says of Apelles, That he painted Clytus on Horseback, going to Battle, and demanding his Helmet of his Squire . And of Aristides, That he painted a Beggar whom we could almost understand , pene cum voce. Of Cresilochus, That he had painted Jupiter bringing forth Bacchus, and crying out like a Woman , Et Muliebriter ingemiscentem. And of Nicearchus, That he had painted a Piece, in which Hercules was seen very Melancholly, for having been a Fool , Herculem tristem, Insani ae poen;tentia. No Body sure will condemn those ways of Expression which are so common. Pliny had said much more of Apelles , he tells us, That he painted those things which could not be painted , as Thunder, Pinxit qu ae pingi non possunt . And of Timanthes, that in all his Works there was something more understood, than was seen, and tho' there was all the Art imaginable, yet there was more Ingenuity than Art. Atque in omnibus ejus operibus, intelligitur plus semper, quam pingitur; & cum Ars summa sit, Ingenium tamen, ultra artem est . If we take the Pains to compare these Expressions with those of Homer , we shall find him very wise in the Description which he has given of that Shield, so that there is nothing to find fault with in the Manner. Now for the Subject. If that Shield , says one, had been made in a wiser Age, it would have been more correct, and less charged with Matter . I perceive very well, that the wiser Age is ours: I don't know what ours could do on such a Subject, but we may praise it as much as we please by Conjecture. Those are happy who can see so far, but in respect to the Matter, wherewith the Buckler is charged, I say, there are two things which cause the Censurers to fall into this false Criticism: The first is, That they think that Shield was no broader than the Brims of an Hat, whereas it was large enough to cover an whole Man. The other is, That they did not know the Design of the Poet, and imagined, that that Description was only the Maggot of an unruly Wit, which did it by Chance, and not follow Nature. If they would have taken the pains to have instructed themselves before they spake, they would have found, that Homer's Intention was to represent in that Shield, all the Universe, and the different Occupations of Men, both in War and Peace. Several of the best Criticks among the Ancients took the Pains to shew Homer's Ingenuity in that Shield; but especially a very learned Woman, called Damo , who I believe was Pythagoras's Daughter, wrote a very long and rational Comment on it. We need only see what Eustathius says, and he'll convince us that Homer is far from deserving any blame, and that on the contrary he deserves great Praise, for having executed with such Order such Harmony, and so few Figures, so great a Design as the Representation of the Universe, and all that passed in it except Hunting, which was at that time no diversion to Princes; and Navigation which has done more hurt than good to Mankind; so that it has been always said, that that Description was not only the Work of a good Poet, but also of a great Philosopher who knew how, in order and probability, to mix the Grave and the Profound with all the richness of Art. This is the Subject which is look'd on as childish and frivolous, as badly managed, and illy understood. But since we speak of a Wise Age, let us see what was done in one, which having more Conformity to ours than that of Homer , may pass as one wiser than that of the Greek Poet. Virgil has very happily made a Shield for Æ neas , as Homer did for Achilles . The Latin Poet who imitated the Greek one, took such care to accommodate those things which time had changed, and which would not be agreeable to the Palate of his Readers, that he hath not only charged his Shield with a great deal more Work, since he paints all the Actions of the Romans from Ascanius to Augustus , inclusively, but hath not avoided any of those Expressions which offend the Criticks. We see here the Wolf of Romulus and Remus , who gives them her Dugs, one after another, Muliere alternos, & Corpora fingere lingua : We see also the Rape of the Sabines , and the War which immediately followed it, Snbitoque novum Consurgere bellum ; we see Metius drawn by four Horses; and Tullus who draws his Entrails thro' the Forrest. We see Porsenna , who commanded the Romans to receive Tarquin and Besieged Rome . We see the Geese, who flying to the Porches of the Capitol, give notice by their Cries of the Gauls scaling it. Atque hic auratis Volitans argenteus anser Porticibus, Gallos in Limine adesse canebat. We see the Salian Dance, Hell, and the Pains of the Damned; and further off, the Place of the Blessed, where Cato presides; we see the Famous Battle of Actium , where we may distinguish the Captains: Agrippa with the Gods, and the Winds favourable. Anthony leads on all the Forces of the East, Egypt , and the Bactrians ; the Fight begins, the Sea is red with Blood, Cleopatra gives the Signal for a Retreat, and call'd her Troops with a Systrum. Patrioque vocat agmina systro . The Gods, or rather the Monsters of Egypt , fought against Neptune, Venus, Minerva, Mars and Apollo . We see Anthony's Fleet beaten, and the Nile sorrowfully opening his Bosom to receive the conquered: Cleopatra looks pale, and almost dead at the Thoughts of that Death which she had already determined; and the Wind Japix which hastens her Flight. We see the three Triumphs of Augustus ; and that Prince to perform his Vow, consecrates three hundred Temples to the Gods of his Country, and the Streets eccho with Shouts of Rejoycing The Temples and the Altars are filled with Ladies offering up Sacrifices, and Augustus sitting at the Entrance of Apollo's Temple, receiving Presents and hanging them on the Pillars of the Temple, while all the conquered Nations pass by, who speak different Languages , and which are differently equipped and armed. \--- Incedunt vict ae, longo ordine gentes, Quam vari ae linguis, habitu, tum vectis & armis. Nothing can justifie Homer better, or shew the Wisdom and Judgment of Virgil He was charmed with Achilles's Shield, and therefore would give the same Ornament to his Poem, but as Homer had painted the Universe, he was sensible that nothing remained for him to do, he had no other way to take then that of Prophesie, and shew what the Descendant of his Heroe should perform, and he was not afraid to go beyond Homer , because there is nothing improbable in the Hands of a God. If the Criticks say, That this is justifying of one Fault by another, I desire that they would agree among themselves. For Scaliger who was the first that condemned Homer's Shield, admires Virgil's ; but suppose they should agree, 'twould be foolish to endeavour to perswade us, that what Homer and Virgil have done by the Approbation, of all Ages is not good; and to make us think that one particular Tast should prevail over that of all other Men. I should not have troubled my self to have defended Homer , if I had not been desired to do it, for I must confess, that nothing is more Ridiculous than to trouble ones self to answer to those People who shew so little reason in their Criticisms, that we can do them no greater Favour, than to think that 'tis their Ignorance: But that is not always unhappy, and may sometimes hit on the Right, but to judge it always, shews as if they had a design to make the best things bad, or that they have so little sense as to take things only contrary. If any be so curious as to see the Difference between a good and a bad Piece of Work, let them view the Shield of Hercules , which is attributed to Hesiod , and compare it with that of Homer or Virgil ; there is nothing more different. Illum Hominem dices, hunc possuisse Deum. That one appears like the Work of a God, and the other like that of a Man. 48 Lastly in respect to Fame, for we have proved, that the Poet need only follow the common Opinion .] But 'tis necessary that the Opinion which we follow be general, and that it be not contradicted at the same time by Truths which are better explained and known; such was the Opinion which Homer followed in speaking of the Gods. 49\. All that appears Absurd may be also justify'd by these three ways, either by the Maxim which we have already laid down ,  &c.] There are apparent Absurdities in Homer , which are justify'd by one of these four ways, which Aristotle mentions. The Wound of Venus may be put into the Number; the Tears of Mars , and such like; but the Criticks have often taken those things for Absurd and Unreasonable, which in their own Nature are perfectly fine. Julius Scaliger derides what Achilles says to Thetis. That he was afraid the Flies would corrupt the Body of Patroclus. Had he no little Slave , says he, that could drive away the Flies This is a notable Objection, as if there was not more Poetry and Grandeur, by bringing in Thetis to comfort Achilles , and promise him to perfume the Corps with some Ambrosia, that should preserve it an whole Year. By this means Homer explains the Nature of Corruption; and that of Salt which hinders it. In another place he says, That Homer is Impertinent, because he feigns in the fifteenth Book of the Iliad , that Juno prays to the God Somnus , to send Jupiter to sleep, and promises him the Graces in Marriage. He believes that Natural Philosophy is terminated in this Fiction: Jam hic, says he, nullam Physin Physici Comentabuntur . However nothing is easier than to find some Physicks hidden under this; for by it Homer would denote the return of the Spring, when Juno , that is to say, the Earth, after laying barren all the Winter, demands very importunately, That Jupiter may be laid asleep; that is, that a quiet and calm Air may caress her, and thereby re- animate all Nature, which is languishing; and as that Tranquility, by all that is most pleasing and agreeable, Homer aptly feigned, That the Earth should give to Sleep one of the Graces in Marriage. Nothing can be more Ingenious than this Fiction; and Virgil has explained it in his Georgicks the eleventh Book, Vere tument terr ae, & genitalia semina possunt. Tum pater omnipotens f aecundis imbribus Æther, Conjugis in gremium l aetae descendit, &c. And that that which Homer calls Sleep, Virgil calls Rest . Si non tanta quies Iret, frigusque Caloremque Inter, & excipient Coeli Indulgentia terras. We need only read these two places and compare them together; but altho' there was nothing hid under the Fable, yet it would be marvellous, for nothing can be more happily imagined. Juno would favour the Greeks , and to succeed in it, 'twas necessary to deceive Jupiter , and to lay him asleep; and as she knew that there was nothing a Woman could not obtain when she gave Love, she endeavours to set out all her Charms, and to make her self Lovely. To the end she borrowed Venus's Girdle, whom she had first deceived; to this she adds the assistance of Sleep , which is not useless on these Occasions, and Promises that if he will make Jupiter Sleep, he shall Marry one of the Graces , she afterwards presents her self to the God, who was charmed with her Beauty, and fell into the Snare. At the same time the Earth offers a fine Green Bed, strowed with Flowers, and places it beneath their Feet, and they were wrapt up in a Golden Cloud, & c . this is what Poetry can do; and they must be very ill natur'd who condemn it. There's no Woman but wou'd judge better of that Marriage than Scaliger , who was amazed at it; for there is none who doth not know the Necessity, and who is not perswaded that the Graces are to be found in the Arms of Sleep. The same Critick adds, That Virgil is much wiser in the Imitation which he makes of this place in the first of the Æ neids , for when Juno entreats Æ olus , and promises him one of her Nymphs , she tells him, 'Tis to bring him pretty Children, whereas in Homer Juno says to Sleep; I will give you the finest of the Graces, with whom you shall be always Enamoured . Tho this Promise of Juno's displeases Scaliger , yet that in Homer appears to me much more Polite and Gracious, than that in Virgil , there is no comparison. 50\. As for those things which seem contrary to what has been said before, we must examine them as we do Objections in Logick .] There are often in the Works of the Poets some things which appear as it were contrary to those which they have said elsewhere, and which the Censorious Criticks have not failed to take notice of as inexcusable Faults. Aristotle teaches us how we ought to examine those Places in order to justifie them. We must examine them, says he, as we examine the Objections, made in Logick against those things which have been advanced: For to answer to them, and to find the Solution, we must have recourse to these Places, and to examine, Whether It is the same Thing. It relates to the same End. It is spoken in the same Manner. It is the same Person which speaks in both Places. Aristotle adds a fifth in the fifth Chapter of the first Book of False Reasoning . ἤ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif)  , for a thing may differ from it self in different Seasons. 51\. The Just Criticisms, to which no answer can be given, are where 'tis plain, that one Place is Unreasonable and Absurd, and that another is bad ] As Aristotle's Design, is not to justifie the Poets from those Errors into which they may have fallen, but to refute the Criticisms which are made on the Places which appear faulty, altho' they really are not so, he tells us what those Faults are which cannot be excused. Always when the Poet, without any necessity, has recourse to Impossibilities or Absurdities, that he makes bad Characters, contradicts himself, or violates the Rules of his Art, he is inexcusable, and 'tis in vain to endeavour his Justification. 52\. A Poet falls into the first Fault, where he has recourse, without necessity to that which is without reason, and such is the fault of Euripides in his Ægaeus.] 'Tis not without reason that Aristotle condemns the Part of Æ gaeus , in the Medea of Euripides , for 'tis Absurd, and without any reason. In the third Act of that Play we see Æ gaeus , who coming from Delphos , and passing thro' Corinth to go to Trezenium , by chance meets with Medea , and discourses with her, without having any other part in the Action, or being concerned upon any necessary occasion. After the first Complements Medea enquires the reason of his Voyage, he gives her an Account, and very famliliarly tells her the Oracle, which he had received, which was not proper for a Princess to know; after that she tells him the History of Jason's Infidelity, and desires an Asylum at Athens. Ægaeus grants her Request, provided he has no hand in her running away, for he would have no Quarrel with Creon. Medea obliges him to confirm his Promise by an Oath, which he did, says he, as much on his own Account as for her; on this he leaves her, and continued his Journey. Medea and the Chorus wish him a good Journey, and there's no more mention made of him. All this is full of Absurdities, and so much the greater, because they are committed without necessity. 53\. He was guilty of the second, when he introduces a bad Character without any occasion, such is the Character of Menelaus in the Orestes of that Poet .] This Character of Menelaus is bad, because it is unequal, this has been explained at large in the Remarks on the fifteenth Chapter. 54\. The Objections which are made to the Poets, may be reduced under five Heads ] This is the Conclusion of the Chapter, and as it is long and full of Matter, Aristotle took care to put at the end, a short Summary to refresh his Readers Memory. 55\. And the Answers which may be made to them, may be drawn from those places we have set down, and which are in all twelve .] It seems that Aristotle had laid down twelve Solutions, and those which are more have relation to one of these twelve Principal ones, which are not very easie to reckon up. Victorius found so much difficulty in it, that he durst not undertake it. I shall be bolder than he. The Criticks can fall only on these three things. On the Subject. --- On the Means. On the Manner. Each of these three has Places, which are proper to it, from which we may draw the Solutions which justifie it. It seems to me that there are four for the Subject. What it is. --- What it ought to be. What 'tis said to be. Or what it may be according to the most extensive Probability. That there are five for the Means. The Metaphor. --- The Foreign Word. The Accent. The Pointing. The Ambiguity. That (to conclude) there are three for the Manner where we examine. If the Fault be proper, or foreign, --- If the thing is the same or different. If it is always the same Character. Which Imitation is most perfect, Tragedy, or Epick Poem. Why Epick Poem is compared to the Excellent Players on the Flute, and good Actors, and Tragedy to the bad. The Difference between the Ancient Comedians, and those of Aristotle's Time. Rhapsodies, their Recitations, and Songs, Ridiculous and Lascivious Gestures condemned. The Care of the first Poets to direct the Gestures; and Motions of their Actors. The indisputable Advantages of Tragedy over Epick Poem. 1\.  359 excellent Tragedy, or Epick Poem; and truly that is the best which requires least Aid and Assistance ; and without doubt such is that whose Aim is to please the nicest Spectators: 'Tis evidently thus, That that which imitates all,  360 is the least Simple, for as the Spectators cannot comprehend any thing when all is not set before their Eyes, those who represent things makes a great many Gestures and Motions to make them the more evident . Just almost as the bad Players on the Flute, who move themselves to imitate the Motion of a Quoit, or draw the end of their Band when they play the Scylla, only what they cannot express by their Sounds, they endeavour to do by Gestures . This is the defect of Tragedy, the blame the old Comedians cast on the new ones, and because Callippedes was excessive in his Gestures, Muniscus called him the Ape. The same Railery was used to the Comedian Tyndarus , in so much, that on this account Tragedy will be below Epopoeia, as these latter Actors were inferior to the first. 2\. We assert then that Epopoeia being made for the better sort, it had no need of being upheld by any Motion, but that Tragedy has occasion for those Succours, since it is made for the Common People, and so is consequently inferior to Epopoeia. 3\. But first of all; what we have said against Tragedy, is not against the Art of the Poet, but that of the Actor. For that defect is no less common to those who recite an Epick Poem, as Socrates , or that sing, as Mnesith eens the Opuntian; For both of them accompany'd their imitation and Singing, with Gestures that were extravagant enough. 4\. Otherwise all the Motions are not to be blamed any more than Dances, except they  361 be Lascivious and Effeminate, as those that Callipedes was reproached with, and our Comedians now adays are blamed for, who seem to affect the Gestures of Debauched and Dishonest Women. 5\. Moreover Tragedy produces its effects by it self, and without these Motions, as well as Epopoeia doth; for a simple reading lets us know what it is. If it has other Advantages over Epick Poem, we must confess, that it is preferable to it, since the blame which is laid on it, is not a defect that is proper, and natural to it. 6\. Tragedy has all that is found in Epick Poem, for it may also make use of Hexameter Verse, and which is of no small Consideration, it has also Musick and Decoration, which contribute to give it an Infinite Pleasure, and to render it the more sensible. 7\.  362 But what is yet of more esteem is, that it hath the evidence of an Action, for both in the representation and reading it sets all things  363 before the Eyes of the Spectator. 8\. It hath moreover this great Advantage, that it is not so long, and that it comes to the end of its Imitation in less time. Now that which is well compacted, is much more agreeable, and touches us more sensibly than that which is diffused, and as it were enervate by the length of time. We may be convinced of this Truth, if we put Sophocles's Oedipus , into as many Verses as the Ilias contains. 9\. To conclude: There is no Epopoeia which preserves the unity so well as Tragedy; and a certain Sign of it is, that we may draw the Subjects of many Tragedies from any Epick Poem whatever. And if to avoid this defect in an Heroick Poem, we should keep entirely to one Subject only, as a Tragick Poet doth, it would necessarily follow, That either the brevity of the Subject would make the Poem appear maimed and imperfect; or if we would at any rate give it its due extent, which it ordinarily has, that length would be destitute of Matter, and render the Poem flat. On the ether side if the Poet should mix several Fables with his Subject: That is to say, If he should make an Imitation that was composed of many Actions and Incidents, it would no more have a perfect Unity, than the Ilias and the Odysses, which have several parts of that Nature, that have every one their Grandeur; tho' those two Poems are otherwise as perfect as they can be, and both of them imitate as near as possible one Action only. 10\. If beside all these Advantages Tragedy has this also of obtaining its aim better, and giving more Pleasure, for neither Tragedy nor Epick Poem, ought to give all sorts of Pleasure, but only what is proper to them. It is certain, that Tragedy is more perfect, than Epick Poem, since it obtains its end more exactly. 11\. That which we have said is sufficient to explain what Tragedy and Epopoeia are, their Forms and Parts, with their Number and Differences. To shew the Virtues and the Vices of those two Poems, and what 'tis causes them; to give an exact knowledge of all the Objections which are made to the Poets, and the means which are to be used to refute them. 1\. 'Tis a very doubtful Question to demand immediately, which is the most excellent, Tragedy or Epick Poem .] Having explained all that regards Tragedy, or Epick Poetry, he gives sure Rules to defend the Poets against the Censures of the Ill-natur'd Criticks. Aristotle examines to the bottom which is the most excellent of these two Imitations, Epopoeia or Tragedy. Plato prefer'd the first, and Aristotle immediately proposes all that is wont to be said in its favour; but he declares for Tragedy, in shewing all the Advantages it has of its Rival. Wee'll see his Reasons. 2\. And truly that is the best, which requires least aid and assistance, and without doubt, such is that whose aim is to please the nicest Spectators; 'tis evident by this, that that which imitates all, is the least Simple .] The Partisans of Epopoeia say, That that Imitation being made for the nicest Spectators, and Tragedy for the People, this hath need of a greater number of things. For beside the being of many Actors, a Theater, Habits, Decorations, it hath occasion for Actors, who imitate very exactly the Actions of those whom they represent, since it cannot obtain its end without that. Whereas Epopoeia obtains its end without any of these Assistances. Epopoeia is then more simple, and consequently more perfect. Aristotle goes on to answer that Objection solidly. 3\. That that which Imitates all ] That is to say, which imitates the most minute Motions, and the least Actions of those it represents. 4\. For as the Spectators cannot comprehend any thing when it is not set before their Eyes, those who represent the things make a great many Gestures and Motions, to make them the more evident .] 'Twas cast on Tragedy as an Imperfection, that its Motion and Gestures were grave and exact; for 'twas a Mark, say they, that it was deficient in it self, and that it could not be understood, if it was not acted in a Day. This reasoning is false, as we shall see in what follows. 5\. Just almost as the bad Players on the Flute, who move themselves to imitate the Motion of a Quoit, or draw the end of their Band to them, when they play the Scylla .] There were in Greece excellent Players on the Flute, who by the sound only, could imitate perfectly all the Passions and Actions of Men: But there were also some bad ones, who not being able to arrive at those things by the sound only, added Gestures, and to imitate the rouling of a Quoit, rouled themselves on the Ground: Or if they were to represent the Voracity of Scylla , who swallowed up Ships and Men, they knew no other way than to hale the end of their Band. Epopoeia was compared to the first, because it obtained its end, without any other assistance than Verse; and Tragedy was compared to the latter, who joyned Motion and Gesture to their Verse, and nothing can be more just than this Comparison. All that can be said is, That the Art of Tragedy is not answerable for the Faults of the Actors, no more than the Art of playing on the Flute is for the Ignorance of those who play badly on it. 6\. This is the Defect of Tragedy, and the Blame which the old Comedians cast on the new ones .] This Passage seems to me very remarkable, for it informs us, that in Aristotle's Time and before, Tragedy had suffered very much on account of its Actors, who were not so good as they had been, for they were more dissolute, as we may say, in their Gestures, and did not retain the Simplicity and Gravity of the Aneients; I believe the change which was made in the Musick, render'd them more Soft and Lascivious, and contributed very much to spoil the Action; for their Manners being corrupted, the Gestures were so too, for the Motions of the Body will necessarily follow the Corruptions of the Heart. 7\. And because Callipedes was excessive in his Gestures Miniscus calls him the Ape.] Miniscus, Callipides and Pindar , were three Comedians who had a great Reputation. Miniscus was the most ancient, he blamed Callipedes for being too Antick, and for that reason he called him the Ape ; for he imitated the least thing, and carried himself so, that without stirring out of his place, he seemed to go a great way. There was a Proverb made on his Name, to signifie a Man who took a deal of pains to do nothing; on this was the Raillery on Tiberius founded, in calling him Callipedes ; because every Year he made great Preparations for his Voyage, suffer'd the People to make Vows for his safe Return, but never stir'd out of Rome. Utvulgo Jam per Jocum Callipedes vocaretur quem cursitare, & ne Cubito quidem mensuram progredi, proverbio Graeco notatum est Suetonius Tiberius , Chap. 8. Cicero had railled Varro in the same manner, before Tiberius's Time; for as Varro had promised to dedicate his Books of the Latin Tongue to Cicero , and made no Advances in that Work, he writes to his Friend Atticus, Biennium jam pr aeteriit, cum ille Callipedes assiduo cursu Cubitum nullum processierit. Two Years are past since that Callipedes has been running without gaining one Cubit Book XIII. Epist. 12. This Fault of Callipedes , did not hinder him from being esteemed in his Time, he was so pufft up with the Reputation he had, and possessed of his own Merit, that going one Day into the Place where Agesilaus was, and perceiving that the King took no notice of him, had the Impudence to say, Ah, Sir! Don't you know me? Has no Body told you who I am? Agesilaus answered, Are not you a Comedian ? By the Word which Agesilaus used, it seems as if he did not only reproach him on account of his Profession, but the Fault into which he was fallen, for he uses the Word Deicelista , which signifies an Imitator, a too exact Copyist. 8\. Insomuch, that on this account Tragedy will be below Epopoeia, as the latter Actors were inferiour to the first .] Epopoeia was like the first Actors, who were such of Wisdom and Gravity, and Tragedy was like the latter, who were fallen into a Vicious Affectation; but that is not the fault of Tragedy, but of the Actors. 9\. We assert then, that Epopoeia being made for the better sort .] 'Tis thus that I thought that I ought to Translate ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ἷ ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , for that is what we call properly the better sort , that is People of the best Education.

But I am perswaded, that the best Poem is that which diverts the better sort, and those who are best Educated. 10\. But first of all what we had said against Tragedy, is not against the Art of the Poet, but that of the Actor .] The Consent of the Patrons of Epopoeia is a certain Token of this Truth, for the first Comedians were not guilty of that Fault, the latter were. We must not then judge of a Tragedy by the Gestures and the Motions of the Actors, for at that rate, a Piece that would be good if it was played by a Miniscus , would be bad if it were acted by a Pindar or a Callippedes . If the Excessive and Effeminate Gesture of an Actor can do damage to a Tragedy, then the Vicious Pronunciation of a Reader may also hurt an Epopoeia, which cannot be thought of without an Absurdity. Tho' the Ilias be badly read, and the Oedipus of Sophocles illy plaid, yet neither of them will thereby cease to be excellent in their kind, for the Poet is not responsible for the Defects of the Reader or Actor. 11\. For that Defect is no less common to those who write an Epick Poem as Sostrates, or that Sing as Mnesitheus of Opuntum. Hipparchus the Son of Pisistratus , was the first, as they say, that brought Homer's Poems to Athens , and made a foundation for some People who should write them publickly, with a great deal of show and pomp, during the Pan-Athenian Feasts . These People were called Homerists or Rhapsodists , either because they joyned together different parts of these Poems, or because they held a Laurel branch in their Hand while they recited them. This Establishment of Hipparchus was so well received, that in a little time there was an infinite Number of the Rhapsodists ; for several Towns instituted Feasts and Shows, and gave considerable Prizes to those who should succeed best in this Profession: In fine, they came so in Vogue, that there was no Assembly, Sacrifice, or Feasts, to which one of these Rhapsodists was not invited. I find that they did not stint themselves to recite Homer's Verses only, they recited also those of Hesiod, Archilochus, Mimnermus, Phocylides , and used the Iambick and Lyrick Verses, as the Hexameters. But I dont remember that I have read any where else than in Aristotle , that there were two sorts of Rhapsodists , one that repeated the Verses without Singing, as Sostrates , and another that repeated them singing, as Mnesitheus of Opuntum. 12\. For both of them accompany'd their Imitation and Singing, with Gestures that are extravagant enough ] 'Tis certain that the same Blame which may be laid on Tragedy, may be also laid on Epopoeia, and with as much reason, for the Rhapsodists had a Theatre built, and Cloaths made for that purpose, which were of divers Colours, Gold Rings, a Crown, and a Branch of Laurel; as for their Gestures they were no less extravagant than those of Callipedes and Pindar The famous Rhapsodist Ion , on whom Plato vouchsafed to make a Dialogue, and says in express Terms, That when he recited any thing that was pitiful, he shed Tears, and when he recited any thing that was terrible, his Hair stood an end, he was entirely beside himself, and as it were Mad. 13\. Otherwise all the Motions are not to be blamed, any more than Dances, except they be Lascivious and Effeminate. ] This third Reason is no less solid than the rest; Tragedy cannot be blamed for making use of Gestures; for that can only be when it employs those which are not agreeable to the Majesty of the Poem; for if in the Gesture of Actors, as in Dances, there are some that have Dignity and Decency, and there are others that are Effeminate and Lascivious. For this reason the Ancient Poets took the pains to dress their Actors themselves, and to mark all the Steps of the Dances in their Pieces, that so there might not be one Motion but what was Noble, and agreeable to the Quality of the Verses which were sang, and to this end they studied with great application, the different Gestures, and all the Postures of the Statues made by the most eminent Masters of Antiquity, especially those that represented the Dances of the Ancients, on these they formed the Gestures of their Persons, and the Dances of the Chorus, this seems to me very remarkable. They learn'd Wisdom and Modesty from the Mute Statues, which were not be found in their time, when all was corrupted by Softness and Luxury. 14\. And our Comedians now adays are blamed for, who seem to affect the Gestures of Debauched and Dishonest Women ] After the Poets had left off mounting the Stage, and to dress the Actors, the Comedians being left to themselves, immediately spoiled the Acting, and degenerated from that Wisdom and Simplicity, by which it had been maintained. In Aristotle's Time this Corruption was perceived very sensibly; the Acting of most part of them, was Immodest and Disorderly. 15\. Moreover, Tragedy produces its effect by its self, and without these Motions, as well as Epopoeia doth; for a simple Reading, lets us know what it is .] He shew'd us in the first place that the Gestures don't proceed from the Poet, but Actor. In the second place, That they are common to Epopoeia and Tragedy. And in the third place, That they are not all to be blamed. Now he gives a fourth Reason, by which he proves, That those Gestures are no more necessary for Tragedy, than they are for Epopoeia, since it performs its effect without their assistance; for there is no Person, who will not be affected with a simple Reading of the Oedipus of Sophocles , provided he sees all its Beauties. 'Tis very ridiculous then to prefer Epopoeia to Tragedy, under pretence that this uses Gestures and Motions, since they are not at all proper, and natural to it, and that it uses the Theatre only for the greater Pleasure of the Spectator, as Epopoeia employs them, when 'tis sung in the Publick Assemblies. But it seems to me that Aristotle has not answered to the strongest Argument which he used to exalt Epopoeia above Tragedy, nevertheless it may be retorted on Epopoeia, and made use of to shew one of the greatest Advantages Tragedy has over it. If Epopoeia is made for the better sort, and Tragedy for the Common People, Epopoeia is, beyond Contradiction, the most excellent and perfect, for 'tis a sure Rule in Nature, as well as Morality. That that which serves the greater, is more perfect than that which serves the less; but Tragedy is made no less for the better sort, than Epopoeia; and hath this more; 'tis made for the People; 'tis therefore without any dispute preferable to Epopoeia; for that which serves all, is, more considerable than that which serves a part only. This is a demonstration to which I believe nothing can be opposed. 16\. Tragedy has all that is found in an Epick Poem .] He now goes on to set forth all the Advantages of Tragedy. It hath all that is in Epick Poem, but that hath not all that is in it. For this reason, he that can judge well of an Epick Poem, shall not always do so of a Tragedy: But he that can judge well of a Tragedy shall always judge well of an Epick Poem, as we have said on Chap. V. 17\. For it may also make use of Hexameter Verse . To prevent any Advantage that Epick Poem may take on pretence that its Hexameter Verse is more noble than the Iambick. Aristotle tells us, That Tragedy may also employ the same Verse, and if it has not been done, 'tis because the Iambick appeared more proper for it. He might have added, That Epick Poem could successfully use the Hexameter only, whereas Tragedy uses the Anapestes and Trochees, with the Iambicks in the course of the Acts, and that it has Verses of a different Measure for the Chorus's, which give it a variety that Epick Poem has not. Our Tragedy hath only the same Verse as Epopoeia, which is one of the Reasons that make it so much inferior to the Greek Tragedy, and this I think none will dispute. 18\. And which is of no small Consideration, it hath Musick and Decoration.] Aristotle told us the Epopoeia was sung, how comes it to pass then, that Tragedy has Musick which Epopoeia has not? However specious this Objection may appear, 'tis not difficult to give an Answer to it. Epick Poem is not naturally made to be sung, but read. The Singing which was afterwards added to it, was an Invention of the Rhapsodists; for when 'tis said that Homer sang his Verses, 'tis not to be thought that 'twas so regulated Musick, 'twas rather a Pronunciation with Cadencies, than a Song. 'Tis not the same with Tragedy, it hath Chorus's made on purpose to be sung, and the Poet takes no less pains for his Verse, than for his Musick, witness that little History which is made of Euripides . 'Tis said, that one Day when he taught the Musick of one of his Chorus's to the Musicians, one of them who heard him, fell a laughing; to whom Euripides said, It plainly appears Friend, that you are a Sot, and an Ignoramus, since you Laugh when I sing the Mixolydian Tone . The Mixolydian Tone was very sad and made People Weep. Euripides had reason to think that that Man was a Sot and an Ignorant Fellow, since he Laugh'd at that which drew Tears from others. 19\. Which contribute to give it an infinite Pleasure, and to render it the more sensible .] We can't doubt of this Truth, and 'tis easie to perceive by it, that in taking away the Chorus's of Tragedy, they have deprived us of one of the greatest Advantages, that of the Ancients had over Epick Poem; for all the Musick which can be placed in the Interludes of our Plays, and all the Dances that can be added, do in no wise produce the same effect, because they cannot be considered as parts of the Tragedy. They are strange Members which corrupt and render it monstrous. 20\. But that which is yet of more esteem, is that it hath the Evidence of an Action, for it sets all things before the Eyes of the Spectator .] Epopoeia is only a Recitation, but Tragedy is a Representation of the Action it self. Now 'tis certain that what we see affects much more than what we hear. Tragedy is then more perfect and excellent than Epopoeia. 21\. In the Representation, and in the Reading ] I think this Passage ought to be Translated thus, ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , in the Reading , ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ,  , in the Action . That's to say, in the Representation; for this is one of the great Advantages of Tragedy, That whether it be Read or Represented, it exposes all to the Eyes of the Reader, and Spectator: Victorius chuses rather to Translate, ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , in the Remembrances and Incidents , but why should Aristotle look for the Remembrances, to distinguish them from the Incidents; This is neither Natural nor Probable. 22\. It hath moreover this great advantage, that it comes to the end of its Imitation in less time .] Tragedy is confined to one Course of the Sun, nay does not take that up entirely neither, when as Epopoeia has no set bounds. However we must not imagine that this difference was imaginary at the beginning, its ground was the nature of those Poems; Epopoeia is made to correct Manners and Habits, and Tragedy to purifie the Passions; and as these are raised at once, and the others require longer time to be imprinted on us, 'twas necessary to give a greater extent to Epopoeia than Tragedy. Wherefore Tragedy is more perfect, since it arrives in less time to the end of its Imitation; but for the same reason then, one of Æ sop's Fables ought to be prefer'd to a Tragedy. For tis shorter, and obtains its end sooner; 'tis not the same thing; Epopoeia and Tragedy are as truly Fables as those of Æ sop , but they have their just Magnitude which those of Æ sop have not. Now Aristotle speaks here only of those Works which make a Body of a just extent, and are the only ones that can be called fine, for as it hath been said already, Beauty consists only in the Magnitude and the Order. 23\. Now that which is well compacted, is made more agreeable than that which is diffused .] To prove that the shortness of Tragedy is preferable to the length of Epopoeia, he uses a general Rule which is found true in all things. That which is compact, is more agreeable, and affects more friendly, than that which is diffused; the truth of this Assertion is very natural, and we need not go far to seek the reason of it. That which is compact, teaches us at the same time, with all its parts, but that which is diffused, teaches us only by degrees and successively, any body may try this in reading a Tragedy and an Epick Poem. The first affects us very sensibly, because all the Parts of its Actions strike us as it were at once, Epick Poem does it slowly, because we are affected but with one part only, and the length of the Episodes, temperates and mollifies, as I may say, the force of the Action. 24\. We may be convinced of this truth, if we put Sophocles's Oedipus into as many Verses as the Ilias contains .] This is a proof of the reason he hath mentioned; which is, that if an Epick Poem should be made of the Action of the Oedipus , in extending it by Episodes, we should undoubtedly find, that that Poem would be more flat, insipid and languishing, than the Tragedy of Sophocles ; and would not strike us so vividly. The same thing would be proved if a Tragedy should be made of the Ilias , for that Action contained in the bounds of a Tragedy, would have another sort of Vivacity than it has in a long and large Poem. 25\. To Conclude there is no Epopoeia which preserves the Unity so well as Tragedy.] Aristotle has often told us, That Epopoeia as well as Tragedy, is the imitation of one and the same Action. From whence comes it then, that he now tells us that the Unity of Epopoeia is less perfect than that of Tragedy? This is in my Opinion the explication of a Passage, which seems at first sight to have some difficulty: Tragedy hath only very short Episodes, so that all the Parts of its Action separated from one another, are so small, and so imperfect by themselves, that there is not one of them that can make an entire Action by it self alone, this is what makes the perfect Unity of Tragedy. 'Tis not so with Epick Poem, for as that is very extensive and much amplified by its Episodes, those Episodes which are but Members of the Principal Actions, are considerable enough in themselves to make a perfect and entire Action, tho' they should be seperated from the Body of the Poem. 'Tis true, that altogether, they compose one and the same Action; but separately, they make many, and by that variety render the Unity of Epopoeia less exact and strict than that of Tragedy, tho' it be otherwise as perfect as the Nature of the Poem will permit. 26\. And a certain sign of it is, that we may draw the Subjects of many Tragedies from any Epick Poem whatever .] The foregoing Remark has sufficiently explained the reason which Aristotle gives of his Opinion, and reconciles this Passage with that of Chap. 23\. where he says, That the Ilias or Odysses can furnish only one Subject for Tragedy, or two at most. This is true of the Ilias or Odysses taken in their first Fable, their first Plan, as has been said in the Remarks; but these Poems considered with all their Episodes, can furnish many Subjects for Tragedy, since every Episode is considerable and extended enough to furnish one by it self, and 'tis this length and entireness of the Episodes, which do in some manner alter the Unity of Epopoeia; for 'tis certain that the Unity of any thing is more perfect in the proportion that the Parts which compose it are perfect, and as they can make an whole. 27\. And if to avoid this defect in an Heroick Poem, we should keep entirely to one Subject only, as a Tragick Poet.] Aristotle is not satisfied to give the Reasons of his Opinion, but gives also the Proofs of his Reasons, and draws them from Experience and Practice. To establish then this Truth, That the Unity of Epopoeia, is less perfect than that of Tragedy, and to shew that it can't be otherwise, that 'tis not the Fault of the Poets but the Poem. He enquires what would happen, if a Poet should oblige himself to imitate the Unity of a Tragedy in an Epopoeia. 28\. It would necessarily follow, That either the brevity of the Subject would make the Poem appear maimed and imperfect, or if we would at any rate give it its due extent, which it ordinarily has. that length would be destitute of Matter, and make the Poem flat .] This Opinion is very solid and convincing. Suppose a Poet would make an Epick Poem, with the Unity as exact and perfect as that of a Tragedy. What would happen? If he made his Episodes as short and as imperfect as those of a Tragedy, to the end that they might make one whole, 'twould come to pass, that instead of a Poem of the just extent, that an Epick Poem ought to have, that we should only have an Abortive, a maimed and imperfect work; and if to obtain the length of an Epick Poem, he should engage himself to enlarge his Episodes, with mixing other Fables, that extent would be destitute of Matter, and would render the Poem flat and insipid, as Wine which is mixed with Water, that I may express all the Energy of the Term which Aristotle uses. 29\. On the other side, if the Poet should mix several Fables with his Subject; that is to say, If he should make an Imitation that is composed of many Actions and Incidents, it would no more have that perfect unity .] But you may say, That the Poet to avoid both these Inconveniencies, of which we have spoken, may incorporate into his Episodes, other Incidents and Fables, which he may joyn to his Subject. This is very well, 'twill not have even then the perfect Unity of Tragedy; it will only obtain the Unity of an Epick Poem: For having given to his Episodes their just grandeur, each of them will be able to furnish a Subject for a Tragedy, so that he must necessarily fall into that Inconvenience in his Poem, which he endeavoured to avoid. 30\. Than the Ilias and Odysses which have several parts of that Nature, that have ev'ry one their extent tho' those two Poems are otherwise as perfect as they can be, and both of them imitate, as near as possible, one Action only.] Aristotle adds this to prevent his Readers from believing, that he blames Homer's Poems, which he admires in so many Places, and on which he bestows such great Praises; the Unity is not so perfect as in Tragedy, by reason of the extent of the Episodes; but such is the Nature of Epopoeia, that it cannot by any means accommodate it self to a more exact Unity, for Reasons already mentioned. However these Poems don't cease to be perfect in their kind; the Unity of Epopoeia would be Vicious if it was like that of Tragedy; and that of Tragedy would be the same if it approached that of Epopoeia: Each of them hath its Rules and Bounds, which no Poet ought to transgress. 31\. If beside all these Advantages Tragedy has this also, of obtaining its aim better, and giving more pleasure, for neither Tragedy nor Epick Poem ought to give all sorts of Pleasure, but only what is proper to them, it is certain that Tragedy is more perfect than Epick Poem, since it obtains its end more exactly .] Thus Aristotle concludes in favour of Tragedy: Epopoeia and Tragedy endeavour to give us Pleasure, to the end that they may form our Manners and correct our Vices; to obtain this, they take a different way, and tho' both of them receive all the Passions, or each of them have some particular ones, which reign in their Poems. Epopoeia employs particularly Curiosity and Admiration, which places in us a love for the Sciences, and engage us to learn that which we are ignorant of; and Tragedy uses Terror and Compassion, which may render us Cautious of our selves, that we may endeavour to avoid falling into the same Misfortunes, which we see represented to us; and as these means are very apt, they give us pleasure also, and consequently we must agree, That Tragedy is preferable to Epopoeia, which gives very slowly that Pleasure which it ought to give. The Patrons of that Poem not being able to gainsay such an evident Truth, would counterbalance that Advantage, by several other Pleasures which it gives, and Tragedy does not, altho' this be true, yet Aristotle shews, That that retrenchment is useless, because, as hath been said in another place, these Poems are not made to give all sorts of Pleasure, but those only which are proper, and ought to arise from the Nature of their Imitation, and the end proposed we ought to judge of Poems, and all other Works by this, that Epopoeia, calls not to it's assistance any other Pleasures, but to fill up its void Spaces, and to make us attend with less Impatience, and more agreeably to that which it promiseth us. 32\. That which we have said is sufficient to explain what Tragedy and Epopoeia are.] Aristotle according to his Custom, puts at the end of his Work a Summary Recapitulation of all his Design, to let us know, that he hath performed that which he had promised, and that he is come to the end of the first Treatise, according to the Method he had laid down. In the Books which should have followed this. he treated of Comedy, Mimes, Dithyrambicks , and Nomes , that is to say, the Rules and Modes of Singing: the Playing on the Flute; and the Lyre, and of all the Passions. The loss of these Books is very great: The Beauty of this first makes us regret, that there is nothing in all Antiquity that can make it up; we find in this Book a great many things which we should otherwise in all probability have been ignorant of; and which are not only curious, but very useful. We may be sorry for the loss of what Aristotle said of Comedy; but that which deserves our grief most, is what he had wrote of the Passions and the manner of purifying them, for he treated of that matter to the bottom, as appears by the least Chapter of the eighth of his Politicks, where he says, he touches on that en passant , which he would explain here at large and in all its extent. The END.
