He has given in two passages very minute descriptions of angelick beauty; but though the images are nearly the same, the numbers will be found upon comparison very different. And now a stripling cherub he appears, Not of the prime, yet such as in his face Youth smil'd caelestial, and to ev'ry limb Suitable grace diffus'd, so well he feign'd ; Under a coronet his flowing hair In curls on either cheek play'd; wings he wore Of many a colour'd plume, sprinkled with gold . Some of the lines of this description are remarkably defective in harmony, and therefore by no means correspondent with that symmetrical elegance and easy grace which they are intended to exhibit. The failure, however, is fully compensated by the representation of Raphael which equally delights the ear and imagination. A seraph wing'd: six wings he wore to shade His lineaments divine; the pair that clad Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast With regal ornament: the middle pair Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round Skirted his loins and thighs, with downy gold, And colours dipp'd in heav'n: the third his feet Shadow'd from either heel with feather'd mail, Sky-tinctur'd grain! like Maia's son he stood, And shook his plumes, that heav'nly fragrance fill'd The circuit wide--- perceptible resemblance of sound, is sometimes studied, and sometimes casual. Every language has many words formed in imitation of the noises which they signify. Such are Stridor, Balo , and Boatus , in Latin ; and in English to growl , to buzz , to hiss , and to jarr . Words of this kind give to a verse the proper similitude of sound without much labour of the writer, and such happiness is therefore to be attributed rather to fortune than skill; yet they are sometimes combined with great propriety, and undeniably contribute to enforce the impression of the idea. We hear the passing arrow in this line of Virgil ; Et fugit horrendum sridens elapsa sagitta; and the creaking of hell gates, in the description by Milton ; Open fly With impetuous recoil, and jarring sound Th' infernal doors; and on their hinges grate' Harsh thunder. ancients have observed, seem to be the product of blind reverence acting upon fancy. Dionysius himself tells us, that the sound of Homer's verses sometimes exhibits the idea of corporeal bulk: is not this a discovery nearly approaching to that of the blind man, who after long enquiry into the nature of the scarlet colour, sound that it represented nothing so much as the clangor of a trumpet? the representative power of poetick harmony consists of sound and measure; of the force of the syllables singly considered, and of the time in which they are pronounced. Sound can resemble nothing but sound, and time can measure nothing but motion and duration. irregularity of numbers which credulous admiration cannot discover to be eminently beautiful. Thus the propriety of each of these lines has been celebrated by writers whose opinion the world has reason to regard, Vertitur interea coelum, & ruit oceano nox.--- Sternitur, exanimisque tremens procumbit humi bos.--- Parturiunt, montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.--- If all these observations are just, there must be some remarkable conformity between the sudden succession of night to day, the fall of an ox under a blow, and the birth of a mouse from a mountain; since we are told of all these images, that they are very strongly impressed by the same form and termination of the verse. beauties of this kind may be produced. A sudden stop at an unusual syllable may image the cessation of action, or the pause of discourse; and Milton has very happily imitated the repetitions of an echo, I fled, and cried out death ; Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sigh'd From all her caves, and back resounded death . represent, not only the modes of external motion, but the quick or slow succession of ideas, and consequently the passions of the mind. This at least was the power of the spondaick and dactylick harmony, but our language can reach no eminent diversities of sound. We can indeed sometimes, by encumbering and retarding the line, shew the difficulty of a progress made by strong efforts and with frequent interruptions, or mark a slow and heavy motion. Thus Milton has imaged the toil of Satan struggling through chaos, So he with difficulty and labour hard. Mov'd on: with difficulty and labour he--- thus he has described the leviathans or whales. Wallowing, unweildy, enormous in their gait. But he has at other times neglected such representations, as may be observed in the volubility and levity of these lines, which express an action tardy and reluctant. Descent and fall To us is adverse. Who but felt of late, When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear Insulting, and pursu'd us through the deep, With what confusion and laborious flight We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy then. remarkably rough and halting. Tripping ebb; that stole With soft foot tow'rds the deep who now had stopp'd His sluices. meaning, but it ought never to counteract it; and therefore Milton has here certainly committed a fault like that of the player, who looked on the earth when he implored the heavens, and to the heavens when he addressed the earth. excellencies which have enobled all other poets, will perhaps be offended that I do not celebrate his versification in higher terms; for there are readers who discover that in this passage, So stretch'd out huge in length the archfiend lay, a long form is described in a long line; but the truth is, that length of body is only mentioned in a slow line, to which it has only the resemblance of time to space, of an hour to a maypole. the ark; Then from the mountains hewing timber tall Began to build a vessel of huge bulk; Measur'd by cubit, length, breadth, and height. In these lines the poet apparently designs to fix the attention upon bulk; but this is effected by the enumeration, not by the measure; for what analogy can there be between modulations of sound, and corporeal dimensions.
