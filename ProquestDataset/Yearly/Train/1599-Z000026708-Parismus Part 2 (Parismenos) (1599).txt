 disdained not to trauell, to visit simple Diogenes in his Cell. Not the gifts value, but the giuers good will, hath bene alwaies esteemed. Euen so I rest in hopefull assurance, that (of your own most Honorable and vertuous inclination, to fauour learning) you wil daine to take this small gift, proceeding from my hartie good will. Which I am bold to present to your protection, thereby in some sort to expresse my humble dutie, which bindeth me to giue your worthinesse a far better present then this, if my abilitie were correspondent. The dutifull regard I beare to your laudable guifts, beeing such, that I am vnable (hauing no other meane) to expresse the same: humbly beseeching your honor, to accept this gift in place of a better:  & my humble and dutifull meaning, in steed of a better performance: And (according to your vertuous bountie) vouchsafe to protect this talent of my poore labors, vnder the Title of your honorable Pratronage. Which shal bind me to inuocate the almightie, to indue your noble minde with innumerable vertues, increase your honors, inrich you with all blessings, and reward you with eternall happinesse. Your Honours in all dutie, Emmanuell Ford . Parismus , which I wish may prooue worthie your fauour and kind estimation, the Authors whereon my hopes depend: and though it deserue not so much, yet let my good meaning therewith purchase the same. If you find any imperfections, passe them ouer with a carelesse respect: and if oght please your fancie, let it counteruaile that which is amisse. If neither wel nor amisse, then I pray rest indifferent: and let your curtesie be greater then my boldnesse: and your fauour beyond my desert. My intent was to please, but if not, my labours are ill bestowed, and my hap the harder: If I may breed any delight to the well minded, or purchase any good opinion of the welwillers to learning, then I haue the reward I expect. One peraduenture will say, the inuention is barren: another, the English is harsh: and a third, all is naught. Yet let me answere in my owne behalfe, that which is lightly discommended, is not easily amended: and the worke well done, that pleaseth all: and that very harsh that none liketh. But I submit my selfe to the wise, curteous, and learned: whom I trust will vouchsafe to esteeme fauourably of my good intent: that though I am not able to compare with any, yet I am willing to proue woorthie: and haue taken some paines to procure their good opinion, vnto which I submit my selfe. As for Momus mates, that are contented with nothing, yet desire most: I let them passe as regardlesse, whom I neither care to please, nor displease: But if my fortune be so aduerse, that I cannot procure their delight I would, then I pleade penitencie: protesting I was in good hope of their fauour. Knowing this, that which disagrees with ones fancie, may delight an others. So that I am in hope this poore Treatise, may passe with the fauourable opinion of some, though not of all, yet especially of the curteous: That I still rest in hope, I shall not be frustrated in all my expectation, but reape your curteous censure, for my good meaning. And so I commit you to the heauens protection. Your friend, E. Ford . Towards the midst, till the end of this Booke, for Getulia , alwaies reade Natolia . of Parismus , the renowmed Prince of Bohemia, his trauels with the valiant Kinght Pollipus, in search of Violetta. How Parismus after Pollipus marriage, departed from Thessalie . And of a straunge aduenture befell them in Bohemia . After that Pollipus had wedded Violetta (as is declared in the first part of this Historie) and euery one in Dionisius Court enioyed his owne hearts content, Parismus againe desired to see his natiue countrie of Bohemia from whence he had beene long time absent: as also to comfort his aged Parents, who languished with extreame sorrowe, doubting that hee was perished. Parismus now determined to take his iourney by land, the rather for that Laurana could not brooke the seas, the passage being long and dangerous, that within fewe daies Parismus (hauing with Laurana, Pollipus, Violetta, Tellamur, Barzillus, and two hundreth Knights, being honourably accompanied onward of their iourney by Dionisius and Oliuia , the King of Hungarie , the Prince of Sparta , and his beloued Clariana , Lord Remus and Lady Isabella , with thousands of the citizens of Th aebes ,) left the bounds of Thessalie , to the exceeding greefe of all, especially of the King and Queen, whose farewelles were exprest with exceeding sorrowes, and hearts replenished with sadnes, whose care for their welfare, and praiers for their prosperous successe, were vttered with abundance of teares. They on the other side, with like heauie discontentment and sad sighes; left their delightful company, with whom they could euerlastingly haue remained, if waightie occasions had not withdrawn them. To recount their trauailes, and the countries they ouerpast, would be tedious, the rather for that they were neither crost by misfortune, nor any way indaungered, but atchieued the tediousnesse thereof, with prosperous successe, and within few daies, they arriued in the wished country of Bohemia , whither Parismus welcommed Laurana , with these speeches. Now most deare Lady, you set foote on the Bohemian soile, whither I haue long time wished to coduct you, desiring you to account both it and all therein, as yours to dispose of, and though by your departure, you left your parents in heauinesse, your friends in care, and your subiects disconteted: yet heere shall you finde parents, whom you shall raise from heauinesse, friends whom you shal comfort, and subiects whose pensiue hearts will be reuiued with your presence. Then I beseech you, let no disquiet thought trouble your kinde harts content, but esteeme your selfe both welcome and beloued in Bohemia , for thousads of my subiects haue already deuoted their liues to your command. And deare friends quoth he, as my self I esteeme you, and as my selfe, esteeme your selues welcome hither, for your kindnesse hath deserued that estimation and recompece, that I am not able to make. And deare friend Pollipus , my faithful partner in woe, make you account of all mine as your owne, for well haue you deserued all kinde estimation and friendship of me, whom you haue infinitly bound to you in all league of affection. The Bohemians soone had knowledge of their arriuall, and by infinit troupes came to meete them. Amongst the rest, Aurestes an ancient noble man, desired Parismus to vouchsafe him such honor, as to grace his poore mansion with his presence, & to except of his vnworthy entertainment, to refresh himself after his tedious trauailes: whose kind offer Parismus curtiously accepted: where he and the princesse Laurana were so honorably and louingly entertained, as that she & the rest that were strangers, exceedingly maruailed there at. The aged king and Queen, hauing intelligence that Parismus was arriued & in safetie, cast off their former habit of sadnesse, and banished care, which long had tormented them, and with exceeding ioy, vnwoonted state, and inexplicable maiestie, went forth to meete him royally, accompanied with gallant troupes of estates. Parismus seeing his aged parents, with all reuerence humbled himself to them, who could haue spent many houres onely in embracing him, but seeing Laurana , they both came vnto her, most louingly welcoming her, expressing the same with teares, proceeding from the depth of kindnesse: with all, vttering these words. Most vertuous, kind, and honorable Princesse, our words cannot expresse your welcome, nor our deedes, shewe our good will, our ioy for your presence is not to be described, and our entertainment too simple to entertain you according to our desires. Which said, the aged queen, after a louing embrace, took her by the hand, and all the Ladies of high estate, saluted her with most reuerent behauiours. The good King knowing Pollipus , embraced and welcommed him with great kindnesse. Likewise, the Queen welcommed Violetta , and on euery side, all exprest their ioy, for their happy arriuall. Bonfires were made in the Citie, the belles roong in the countrey, and triumphes in the Court, some welcomed the with gifts, some with myrth, some with prayses, and all with ioy and exceeding reioycings, which my dulled pen is altogither vnskilfull to describe the: king and queene, exceedingly reioyced in their sonnes vertuous choise: and in Lauranaes presece. Laurana was affected with great delight to see their kindnesse, Parismus had his fill of content, and altogither greatly admired Lauranaes beautie, and did their best to welcome and entertain the whole company that came with Parismus , with all curtesie: that the Bohemian court which lately was darkned with the mists of sorrowe, was now beautified with the pleasant assemblies of knights and Ladies, that repaired thither to welcome home Parismus and behold the princesse Laurana . In which place, they continued many dayes after. But Fortune whose constancie was neuer permanent, but disposeth all things according to her owne variable disposition, thus crost their content. Pollipus and Violetta vpon a day walkt foorth for recreation some halfe myle from the Court, into a most pleasant shadie greene wood, which by meanes of the coolenesse and aboundance of sweete smelling flowers, wherewith it was adorned, and by naturall sleight was so pauised, with the assistance of little twigges and spraies, that neither the heate of the sunne, nor vehemencie of winde could molest it, that the place seemed to ad increase to their delight, where they louingly sat downe, recreating themselues with great pleasure, and at last fel both a sleepe, in middest of which slumber, a rauenous wilde beare that haunted those woodes, whom extreame hunger had forced to wander so neare the Court, winded them, and guided by vnluckie fate, came to the place where they lay, readie to seize vpon the tender bodie of kinde Violetta , who at the very instant (by the diuine prouidence) awaked, and espying the vglie beare, suddainly shriked. Pollipus amazed with her crie, started vp and drewe out his sword, and rescued her from the beastes violence, pursuing him with such vigor and dexteritie, that the beare beeing greeuously wounded, shund his blowes, and made haste to get from him, but hee intending to winne honour by his conquest, regardlesly pursued the beare, vntill he was quite out of Violettas sight. Who likewise fearing his harme, and pricked forward with a tender care of his welfare, followed after him, but not knowing which way he was gone, tooke a quite contrarie way, and with eger steppes laboured to ouertake him. Hee hauing with much trauell slaine the beare, smote off his head, and intending to present that spoyle to his loue, came backe to the place where hee had left her, and missing her, hee could not well tell what to thinke, beeing perswaded shee was gone to seeke him, wherewith hee was wrapt into an extreame perplexitie and doubt: fearing that if he should go to the Court to seeke her, she might in the mean time wander out of the way, and runne into danger. Contrarily, hee thought if hee should seeke her in the wood, and shee bee in the Court, his long tariance might bring her in some feare of his welfare, that in these extremities he could not determine of any thing: at last calling her with a loude voyce by name, and not hearing her answere, with all haste hee ran to the Court with his spoyle vpon his swoords poynt, and running hastily, hee enquired if any sawe Violetta returne, but she was not there heard of, which made him cast downe the Beares head, and without speaking a word, returned towards the wood againe. Which strange behauiour of his, draue the Courtiers (but especially Parismus ) into a wonderfull doubt. Parismus seeing the Beares head, and hearing some speech of Violettas absence, presently mounted a goodly steede, and with haste rode that way he was directed Pollipus went. Tellamar, Barzillus , and many other Knights, followed after him, neither of them knowing wherefore they made such haste. Parismus hauing ouertaken him, demaunded if any mischance had befallen Violetta ? My Lord (quoth hee) as she and I lay slumbring in this wood, the beare whose head I brought to the Court, was readie to seize vppon her, but shee with a shrike awaked me, and I pursued him vntil I had slaine him: and returning to the place wher I left Violetta , she was gone: neither can I suppose whither, vnlesse shee bee wandred to seeke me: the haste I made, was to come backe to seeke her. Doo so quoth Parismus , and my selfe and these Knights will search the wood throughout, so euery one tooke a seuerall way. Violetta in the meane time, still wandred on without regard whither she went, her feare perswading her, that shee heard Pollipus blowes and the beare gone right before her, that with as much speede as she could she ranne quite out of the wood, but not yet setting eye on him, (the night approaching) shee was drawne into an exceeding feare of his welfare, and her owne daunger: for to go backe by the wood she durst not, fearing least shee might againe meete the furious beaste: and to go further she thought it vaine, for she sawe no likelyhood hee was come out of the wood, and there, what with greefe and wearinesse, she sate downe vpon a banque, encombred and ouerwhelmed with a thousand cares, and giuing her mind some respit to ponder on her miserable estate, for feare of her most deare Knights danger, she entered into such heauie plaints and lamentations, that euen the very woods and medowes wherinto she was wandred, seemed to impart her sorrowes, & yeeld pitie to her cries & scorching sighes. At which very instant (I know not by what vnluckie destinie) Archas the Cruel (so called for his cruell tyrannie) came to ye hearing of her lamentations, and drawing nigh to her, demaunded her cause of sorrow. Sir knight (quoth she) I am a stranger, that lately came fro Thessalie , with the Prince of this country, and this day, coming into these woods with my Lord & husband Pollipus , a mightie beare encoutred vs, whom he pursuing, I haue lost, & am wandred hither, not knowing which way to retire. Archas all this while, well noting her exceeding beautie, and sweete deliuery of speech, ye gracious moouing and disposition of her eyes, which had power to pearce millions of harts, felt such an inward effect of transitory confusion in himselfe, that he resolued, hauing so fit oportunitie offered him, to trie his wits to win her loue, or exercise by that meanes, some reuenge against Parismus whom he mortally hated, vttering these speeches. Most sweete Lady, my heart is much tormented to see the sorrow you needlesly make, for no doubt your knight is in safetie: pleaseth you to accept of my seruice, my seruats shal guard you to the Bohemian court, where you shall find him: and my self wil search the woodde to giue him knowledge of your returne. Violetta kindly thanked him for his curtesie: who presently mounted her behinde one of his seruants, giuing them secret warning to conuey her to his owne castle, which was scituate in the mountaines: himselfe tooke her scarffe, which he said, he wold deliuer vnto Pollipus , as a token that she was in safetie: wherewith he departed backe into the wood, and tare the same into many peeces, here scattering one, and there confusedly casting another, & withall haste, rode an other way to his Castle. All which was effected before any of the Bohemian Knights were come, by which meanes, their diligent search was all in vaine: which draue Pollipus to such an extacie of sorrow, yt he was almost mad, whom Parismus comforted with many perswasions, vntill Pollipus vttered these speeches. My louing L. neuer shall quiet possesse this brest, rest giue ease to my body, nor sleepe refresh my sences, vntill I haue found my beloued, whose loue is my life, whose safetie is my welfare, & whose quiet, is my cheefest content. At which very instant, came Tellamor , bringing the torne scarffe which Archas hadde strewed, which when Pollipus beheld, a chill colde dispearst through all his vaines, and his vitall breath began to leaue his troubled brest, and all his sences forgat their wonted vse. Which when Parismus beheld, he caught him in his armes, saying: Most noble knight, where is now your patiece, wherwith you wontedly indured extremities? no doubt for all this, Violetta is in health, onely wadred out of the way, & gotten to some house where we shal heare of her to morrow: then comfort your self, and be not thus ouercome with grief: for for be you assured no harme hath betide her. O my Lord (quoth hee) my vertuous Violetta , my constant friend, the most truest loue that euer wretch inioyed, is perished. What comfort, what quiet, what rest, what content, what respit, or what ease can I giue to my troubled minde, since she is fallen into decay, the most purest, most sweetest, most kindest, and truest Lady that euer liued? how can I recouer this losse? how can I plague my selfe sufficiently for my misdeeds? these woods condemne me, her ghost accuseth me, and all the world will hate me, miserie waiteth my steps, sorrow pincheth my heart, griefe compelleth me, and care inforceth me to be thus impatient. Whilest I stand here, she may be in danger: whilest I am negligent, the wilde beasts may deuoure her body: then stay me not, for I am resolued, either to finde her or loose my selfe: and therewith in a great furie, flung into the wood. Parismus seeing his sorrow, and this mishap, stood like one in a traunce, not knowing how or which way to remedie the least of these euils, and in that most sad and heauie estate, returned to the Court with this heauie newes, which turned all their ioy into heauinesse, especially Laurana , and all in generall that had knowledge of Violettas vertues, made great lamentation for her losse. How Violetta arriued at Archas Castle, and what befell to Pollipus afterwards. and soone arriued there, before whose comming, their Maister had caused all things to bee prepared in good order for Violettas entertainment, who beeing entred, she perceiued her selfe to be in a straunge place, which draue her into an extreame feare, and enquiring of them why they had not conueyed her to the Bohemian Court, they tolde her (beeing instructed before) that they had mistaken their Maisters meaning, and withall, intreated her to pardon them, and also to be a meanes to pacifie his wrath, whom they were assured would be greatly offended with them. Which words of theirs altered that feare, and added some little comfort to her minde. Presently two Gentlewomen welcommed her with great courtesie, comforting, perswading, and intising her to remit all care, vntill Archas returne, whom they assured was so honourable and vertuous a Knight, as she needed not any way doubt of his dilligence. There was great store of delicates prouided for her, which seemed more loathsome then gall to her sight. Long they seemed to stay for Archas returne (who absented himselfe to colour his treacherie) but when in a great while he came not, they intreated her to taste of that meate which was prouided they said for his supper. But shee poore soule could not eate one bit, but all things seemed to bee hatefull: their sweete musicke harshe: their curteous entertainment, rude and barbarous: and that well adorned place, more loathsome then a prison, nothing but care and greefe could take place in her vnquiet brest. After supper, they brought her to a most pleasant chamber, where all things were most neately prouided, comforting her with many perswasions, that Archas was at the Bohemian court to expect her comming, and by reason of the nights approach, could not come backe that night, but would early in the morning bring her newes, intreating her to be take her selfe to her rest: which she did, the rather to bee rid from their company, that being alone, she might enter into consideration of her estate: and being by her selfe, she began to reuolue in her minde, her miserable condition, Pollipus perill, and Archas intent: for her selfe she cared not, if Pollipus were in safetie: neither feared shee what Archas entended, if her Knight were in health: that so many cares concurring togither, so many doubts clogged her mind, and such feare possest her hart, that her words, burst into a floud of teares, and the warme bloud seemed to issue from euery vaine of her body, that with their abundance, she bedeawed the bed where she laie. When she had wept her fountaines drie, she then began to accuse her selfe of follie, that would not stay in the place where he left her: then a certaine perswasion entred her heart, that he was dead, which tooke such deepe roote, that of a long time no other thought would take place, which made her thinke the Tapers which gaue her light, burnt blew: which likewise added a further setled resolue in her fancie, that it was so indeede. In this carefull estate, she lay tumbling and tossing her selfe, giuing no quiet to her minde: no rest to her cares: no ease to her pensiue heart: no respit to her sences, nor sleepe to her head: but being ouercome with sorrowe, shee continually rather augmented then diminished the same. In this sad and heauie estate, she spent that night, not suffring her eyes once to slumber. In the morning, the two gentlewomen came to her again, offring her al dutiful seruice, which she kindly accepted. And shortly after came Archas , counterfaiting a sad countenance, with his eyes cast downe to the earth: whom when Violetta beheld, a suddaine feare infused it selfe into euery part of her bodie, and she stood shaking and quaking like one transformed, to heare the news he had brought, which she thought to bee but bad by his looke: who with a shamelesse face, and impudent dissimulation, tolde her that Pollipus was not yet returned to the Court, nor heard of, but all supposed him to bee dead. Which words, strooke such greefe to her heart, that there shee fell downe at his feete in a traunce: but when by their industrie, she came to her selfe againe, her amazed countenance, and lamentable grones, made the teares trickle downe her cheekes, and seeing her in that daungerous estate, conueyed her to her bedde, whose vitall sences were so abated and extinguished that for a long time, notwithstanding their vttermost indeuours, shee seemed no otherwise, then as one quite bereft of sence, and in that lamentable estate, she continued many dayes. Pollipus all that night, raunged vp and downe the woodde in euery corner, searching each thicket and vnfrequented place, calling Violetta by name, and tearing both his flesh and apparell, with the bushes and brambles, that encountred his madde steppes: sometimes making haste this waye, then returning backe with perswasion that he heard her shrike behinde him, being so fullie possest with feare and desire to finde her, that euery fancie that rose in his braine, altered his former thoughts: that whereas in other mens afflictions he seemed most patient and prouident, by his owne, hee was quite bereft of reason. In this vnquiet sort, hee spent the most part of the night, vntill towards morning, what with wearinesse and care that opprest his heart, he laid him downe, leaning vppon his elbowe, neither vttering word nor teare, but inwardly stuft with extreame vexation, seeming no other then the forme and picture of discontent. But when he saw Phoebus display his brightnesse, he againe betooke himselfe to his earnest search, vttering such inward grones, as would haue melted a Rockie heart into liquid teares. Parismus being early vp that morning, gaue commaundement to all the Bohemian Knights, to arme themselues, and to poste throughout all Bohemia in her search, and to make proclamations, with great promises of reward, to them that could bring any newes of Violetta that by time the sunne was vp, there were a great number of Knights departed, vowing to search all places to finde her, that all the whole countrey was filled with report of her losse. Parismus, Tellamor and Barzillus , presently rode to the wood to Pollipus , whom they found in such heauie plight, as it made their manlike hearts to melt with greefe. But Pollipus espying them, would haue fled from their sight, that loued him most dearely, vntill Parismus ouertooke him, and said: Most deare friend, how can you bee so vnkinde, as to shun my company, whose care is no lesse then yours? and who tendeth your welfare as much as mine owne? haue you forgotten manhood, knighthood and curtesie? where is that vertue now become, that was wont to rule your affections? good Pollipus , for my sake, for all the friendship, by all the curtesies, promises, and good will, that euer past betwixt vs, leaue off this desperate follie, and listen to my counsaile: if not for all this, yet for Violettaes sake pittie your selfe, and recall your former sences, and let vs determine how to recouer her, that is but strayed out of the way: many hundred Knights are already posted into most places of this countrey, and will coast all Germaine throughout, but they will finde her: then do not you increase our further care, by this desperate sorrowe, but according to your wonted wisedome, wherewith you haue counsailed mee in my afflictions, let vs studie how to recouer this miserie. Oh my Lord (quoth Pollipus ) my Violetta is dead: at which word, extreame hearts sorrowe, and inward griefe, stopt the passage of his speech, and was restrained with heart-swelling sighes, which being a litle asswaged, he againe said: If I were sure shee were not dead, then would I willingly immitate your direction: or were I but sure death had seized vpon her tender heart, then would I neuer part from this place, though millions of diuels should seeke to driue me hence. Why (quoth Parismus ) how can you thinke shee is dead, when there is no likelihood, signe, nor mention to bee seene thereof: neither her apparell, nor any part of her body torne: or any other circumstance to perswade vs to any such conceit? then why will you suffer any such perswasions to possesse your fancie? Quoth Pollipus , how then came the scarffe so torne? it may be the wilde beasts haue some secret dens, whereinto they haue drawne her bodie, and many other mischaunces befallen her, that shee was subiect vnto, and yet still bee hidden from our knowledge: neither let that trouble you (quoth Parismus ) but rest contented, and your care that way shall soone bee eased: but depart with me to the court; to comfort your selfe with some foode, and I will presentlie giue order to haue this woodde so throughlie searcht, that you shall plainely finde shee hath not miscaried. Pollipus with his perswasions, though vnwillingly, went backe with them, mounting on Tellamors horse, for that he was sore trauailed and wearie of that disquiet nights trouble. Thus for a time we will leaue Pollipus returned to the Court with Parismus, Violetta very sicke and weake in Archas Castle, and many of the Bohemian and Thessalian knights in her search, to turne my sences to write of an other Subiect, long time buried in forgetfulnesse, the cheefest subiect whereon this Historie dependeth. How Parismenos was brought vp in the Ilad of Rocks in Tartaria . How his nurse was slaine by a Lyon. How he liued many yeares like a wilde man, and afterwards arriued at Andramarts Castle. At such time as Laurana was imprisoned in the Iland of Rocks, vnder the gouernment of Adamasia Andramarts sister (as is declared in the first part of this Historie) the nurse vnto whose custody the young child Parismenos was committed, fearing his vntimely death, which Adamasia threatned, because his mother would not consent to Andramarts lust, secretly (to saue the childe from her crueltie fled by night into a desolate wood, where she carefully educated him according to the condition of the place, which was with such wilde fruite as she gathered, making many a hard shift to stanch her hunger, and defend the sweete babe from famine, vntill at length, hearing of Andramarts death, she determined to returne to the Castle, and there present him to his mother: and to that intent, forsaking her poore habitation, she went as she thought, thitherwards, but most vnfortunately, wandred into a desolate and vnfrequented Wildernesse: where she had not long stayed, but met a fierce and cruell Lyon, who slew her: which when Parismenos beheld notwithstanding his infancie, hee laboured with his weake resistance to preserue her: but the Lyon refusing to hurt him, withdrew himselfe to his denne, whither Parismenos boldly pursued him: and being entred therein, the Lyon began to wag his taile and fawne vppon him gently, which made him maruaile why he had slaine his nurse, and would not hurt him: and made him the more bolde, that beeing wearie with trauell, he laide himselfe downe to sleepe, and when he awooke, being very hungrie, he gathered wilde fruite, whereof there was plentie, which was his foode, and the cleare water his drinke. This was his habitation a long time, taking great pleasure to hunt and chase the wilde beasts, from whose furie hee was still preserued by the Lyon. Afterwards when he was growen to riper age, in his sleepe he drempt, that his nurse appeared vnto him, willing him to forsake that vnfrequented place, and to seeke out Andramarts Castle, where he should finde people, in whose company he should bee brought vp. When he awaked, he could not tell what to thinke of his dreame, nor what she ment by Andramarts Castle, nor which way to go thither, being therewith drawne into a deepe studie, but suddainly hee espied a young Beare, whose sight made him quite forget his dreame, and taking exceeding delight to chase such beastes, he caught vp his staffe and followed her, and pursued her so fiercely, that at length hee slewe her: wherewith he was wandred to farre, that getting to the top of a mountaine, and looking round about him, he espied the Castle, thinking that was the place his nurse had tolde him of in his dreame, that hee went thitherwards. It chanced, one of the knights that Parismus had left to keepe the Castle, espied him: and beeing of a sadde disposition, seeing Parismenos begin to withdraw himselfe, ranne to him, and offered to lay hands on him. But Parismenos being afraid of his behauior, strook at him with his staffe so fiercely, that had he not quickly auoyded his blowe, he had beaten out his braines. The Tartarian beeing angrie, drewe his sword, and therewith wounded Parismenos in the thigh, the smart whereof so inraged him, that notwithstanding all his resistance, he left him for dead. Afterwards entring the Castle, his minde was drawne into an exceeding delight, to behold the goodly buildings and beautie thereof. The Tartarians beholding one in such straunge disguise, (for he was clad in the skinnes of such beastes as he had slaine, and his hayre growne to a great length) much maruelled how hee came into that countrie: withall, noting his comely personage and stately countenance, were suddainly drawn into a great affection towards him, that they saluted him most kindly, demaunding the cause of his arriuall in that place, and of whence he was? who seeing their behauiour to be more gentle then the others with whom he had encountred before, made answere so well as he could, yt he knew not: which blunt answere of his, made them muse. Withall, noting his attire, they tooke him either to be a mad man, or that he had bene Sauagely brought vp: which they were the rather perswaded vnto, for that he was very young. Notwithstanding, they entertained him, and vsed him most kindly. By his countenance, calling to remembrance, the noble Knight Parismus , whome hee so much resembled, that they were halfe perswaded he was his sonne, that the nurse fled withall. One amongst the rest named Tyresus , vsed him most kindly, apparelled him decentlie, & instructed him in all points belonging to ciuilitie: teaching him to manage a horse, and vse armor, whereunto he was so apt, and tooke therein such delight, that in short space, he grew to such perfection, that hee excelled his instructor, in all warlike behauiours. And was so generally beloued, that nothing they had or could deuise, was to deare for him. Many dayes remained Parismenos amongst the Tartarians, increasing in many excellent qualities, not finding occasions inough amongst them to make triall of his manhood. Upon a time, certaine Pyrates returning from sea, in his hearing, made report of their battailes & skirmishes, and the huge slaughters they had made: reporting how tragically they murdred some of the resistants, and how valiantly some withstood them, and with what trauell they indured the fight. Making particular rehearsall of one Captaine amongst the rest, who so valiantly withstood them, that before they could vanquish him, hee had slaine aboue twentie of them: but in the ende, seeing that by reason of their multitude, he must needes eyther be taken prisoner, or die, he rather chose an honourable death, then to become their captiue, and indured the fight, vntill with faintnesse he fell downe dead, euen as hee was aduancing his sword to resist them. Which report of theirs, kindled such honourable sparks in Parismenos brest, that hee extreamely thursted to see those braue skirmishes, accounting it dishonourable for him to spend his daies in that obscure place: his thoughts still ayming at higher matters, and his fancie perswading him, that he should rather spend his time in heroicall exercises in Kings courts, then in that vnfrequented place, where no pleasing attempt of martiall deedes was exercised: which thoughts took such effect, that he presently determined to seeke aduentures abroad: and comming to Tyresus who loued him dearely) he tolde him his whole intent, asking his aduise therein. Tyresus , seeing such resolued valour in him, tolde him, that he was both ready and willing to do any thing that might agree to his fancie, or purchase his content: that if he desired to trauaile and hazard himselfe by sea he was ready to go with him: or if he were determined to seeke strange aduentures by land, he would likewise trauaile with him, and forsake no perill for his sake. Parismenos hearing his curteous reply, could not chuse but embrace him, yeelding him many thankes. Tyresius effected all things with such speede, and so well ordered his affaires to further his intent, that within fewe dayes they departed into a shippe well manned and victualled, hoising their sailes, with a mery gale, committed themselues to the mercies of the seas. They sayled many dayes without any aduenture, which inwardlie fretted Parismenos , for his minde longed to performe some exployt. At last, they kenned a sayle a far off, and towards it they styrred amaine: and comming nigh the ship, laide her aboorde, which was of Barbaria , well manned with stout Moores: who seeing the Pyrates, and knowing, that eyther they must resolutely fight it out, or become captiues, valiantly resisted them: betweene whom, began a most fierce & cruel fight: where Parismenos had means inough to exercise his valour, who behaued himselfe with such courage, that many Moores that day lost their liues by his infant blowes. Egradam , Captain of the Moores, being a man of exceeding courage, seeing the cruell slaughter Parismenos made, came to him, and vttered these speeches. Proude Pyrate, thou shalt dearely buye these Moores liues, for I am determined to bring thy cursed life to an ende, that thinkest by robbery to inrich thy selfe. Wherewith hee assayled him so fiercely, that he wounded him in many places: notwithstanding, such was his valour, that with great force, he likewise so valianty defended himselfe, and offending Egradam, that it was doubtfull which of them wold haue the conquest. In middest of this cruel fight, a mightie storme began suddainly to arise, and the windes began to blow with violence, that their Cables burst, and both light of day and sunne was shadowed by thicke Cloudes, the seas began to rage and swell, that they were inforced to giue ouer their fight, the thunders rored, and the lightnings flasht about their eares, and their ship with violence of the surging seas was so tost, that there was none but expected present death. The Northerne blast, rent their sayles, one way goeth their Helme, another way swimmeth their mast, with violence torne from their ship, & waue vpon waue rusht in, ready to ouerturne the ship, who now tossing vpon the seas at libertie, was driuen vppon a flintie rocke and split in sunder. Then beganne a hideous crie amongst the souldiers, some cursing Parismenos the causer of that iourney, some exclaiming on Tyresus, and some banning their owne destinies. Some whelmed vnder the gaping water, yeeld vp their ghostes: here three at once are cast vppon the rockes, and againe deuoured by the waues: there others sunke in the quicke sands, and downe fals the Maister headlong: then might you behold men swim in their armour: here and there striuing to make their death tedious: there might you see one seated vpon a planke, ouerthrown with a waue: here another tumbling with his heeles vpward. Parismenos (by good fortune) was gotten vp to the maste, whose length had some power to indure the waues, with his sword still drawne in his hand. Tyresus he was gotten on to a chest, wherewith a while hee applied himself fro drowning, but in the end, the raging waues dreched him deep in their spatious gulfes. Within a while the raging seas bega to cease and ware calme, the sunne beganne to shine, and the cloudes to vanish that darkened the skies, and the maste whereon Parismenos sate, beganne to slide along with the calme tide: when hee looked about him, and espied all his fellowes drowned, an exceeding sorrow ouerwhelmed his heart, especially for his louing friend Tyresus , that had not the feare he was in reuiued his sences, hee would haue waxt carelesse of his owne life. But the remembrance of his perill made him recall his better sences to their former vse, and to studie for his owne safetie, to whom the seas were so mercifull, that with a gentle and calme tide he was driuen to shore, where getting to a sunnie bancke, he sate him downe to refresh his wearied limmes, and ponder his happie escape from drowning, drying his gaping wounds with such linnen as hee had about him, who with the salt water smarted exceedingly. How Parismenos being cast on shore in Trace , was taken vp by Duke Amasenus , who named him the knight of Fame: of two combats hee fought with Corus and Argalus . As Parismenos was sitting vpon the banke after his shipwrack, in heauie estate for the losse of his deare friend Tyresus , it happened, an ancient Duke of Thrace , named Amasenus , that day was come into a forrest adioyning to the sea to hunt, accompanied by a gallant troupe of Knights, who sheltring himselfe from the storme vnder the craggie cliffes, beheld the miserable shipwracke, and sawe Parismenos swim to shore, and so straungely preserued from drowning, vnto whom he came as hee was sitting vppon a sunnie bancke, and demaunded of whence he was. Parismenos beholding his reuerent age, and the troupe of Knights that attended him, rose from the ground, and with great humilitie bowed his bodie, making this aunswere. I am a miserable man, by crueltie of the seas cast on this shore, hauing lost my faithfull friend, drenched in the spacious gulfes, beeing my selfe reserued to further miseries, my name is hidden from my selfe, neither know I certainly in what countrie I was borne, nor where my Parents remaine, and now am cast into an vnknowne place, and miserably left to the wide world, to indure such hard fortune as my vnluckie starres haue alotted me. Amasenus hearing his answere, and withall, noting his tall and comely proportion and beautifull countenance, thought by his speech that his sences were altered with feare of the tempest, and care for the losse of his friends, that he thus replyed. I perceiue feare of drowning hath made you forget both your selfe, your name, and countrie, which feare now shake off, since all the perill is past, and leaue to greeue for their losse that are irrecouerable, and go with me to my Castle, and to such entertainment as the same yeeldeth, you shall be welcome. I most humbly thanke you (quoth he) for this kindnesse, but whereas you thinke, that feare hath made me forget my selfe, you altogither ayme amisse, for I haue reported of my selfe nothing but trueth. Then stept foorth Corus (a suspitious and enuious Knight) my Lord (quoth hee) it is some Pirate that liueth by spoyle of passengers, and hath heeretofore don you some mischief, which maketh him thus cunningly dissemble. Parismenos hearing his speeches, could not containe himselfe, but made this answere. Most discourteous Knight, neither thy selfe, nor any in this countrie whatsoeuer, shal make me disseble, or once falsifie my word, and were it not that the strangers of this place, and the reuerence I beare to this courteous Lord, withholdeth me, I would euen presently make thee eate that word,  & turne it backe into thy dishonorable throat. Corus beeing a Knight of a proude courage, was so vexed with that reply, that he intreated Amasenus to giue him leaue to reuenge those iniurious words. Stay quoth Amasenus , and leaue off this discourteous behauiour to strangers, heere is neither place nor time, for you see hee is wearied with shipwracke, and faint with effusion of blood: thy pride and discourteous behauiour will one day bee thy death: had he done me wrong, yet he hath not offended thee. Then hee said to Parismenos : Sir Knight, I pray cease this discontent, and goe to my Castle, for so well do I esteeme of you, and so farre am I from the least suppose of any such thought, as my selfe will vndertake his accusation is false. So they departed togither, Parismenos by the way, so well as he could declared his birth, which made Amasenus make greater estimation of him, for by all tokens he thought he should be sprung of kingly race, that Amasenns entertained him most honourably and kindely, and welcommed him in the best sort hee could deuise, which made him disdained amongst many of the knights that attended the Duke, and seeing him so highly esteemed, beganne to suspect by that meanes, that they were but slightly accounted of by Amasenus , that euer after that, they beganne to enuie him, and to consult which way to do them a mischiefe: thinking Corus quarrel alreadie begun, a fit occasion to further their intent, they vrged him to prosecute the same, who beeing readie of himselfe, and the rather by their instigation, sent him this challenge. Knight (for so I must call thee) thou remembrest what past betwixt vs at our first meeting, which thou thinkest I haue forgot, but so far is it from my thought, as courage is from thee to performe that which thou threatnedst: thy feare of drowning is now, and thy deep wounds I am sure well cured, therefore if thou darest maintaine the words thou haste spoken in my disgrace, send me word where I shal meete thee, and there we will end the controuersie. So farewell. As thou wilt, Corus . Parismenos hauing read this braue challenge, smiling thereat, sent this reply. Corus , by the name of the vnknowne Knight, I will aunswere thee, and maintaine my words, wishing thee to be perswaded, that I so little feare thy vaunts, as that euen now I will come to thee, or whe thou wilt, if not now. But if thou intendest to auouch this challenge, thou shalt finde me readie for thee at the South side of my Lord Amasenus parke, and so adue. The Knight of Fame. Corus hauing receiued this reply, presently went and armed himselfe, and came to the appoynted place, where hee found the knight of Fame gallantly mounted, staying for him, whom he little esteemed, as that he assured himselfe the conquest before he begunne: for Parismenos was young and of tender yeares, and nothing comparable to him in growth nor skill, notwithstanding, of such vndaunted resolue, that he would not haue refused to cope with him, had he been another Hercules. Corus seeing him in that readinesse, came to him, vttering these speeches. Knight, I like well thy forwardnesse, and commend thy resolution, but by that time thou departest hence, thou wilt repent thy folly. Parismenos thus answered, if I repent me, the woorst will bee mine, but if I ayme not amisse, thy folly wil be the greatest: for know, that I so lightly esteeme thy speeches, that I account them ridiculous, and this time spent in prate too tedious. With that Corus went backe, and Parismenos retired himselfe to take their careir, which was performed so gallantly, as that they shiuered their lances, passing by without any other harme: presently drawing their keene swords, beginning fight with gallant brauerie, sometimes offending, and sometimes defending, which continued so long, vntill their armour beganne to yeeld to their fierce blowes, and the blood to issue out at many places. In which cruell rage they continued for an houres space, without any disaduantage on either partie, sometimes taking breath, and then againe redoubling their blowes with fresh courage, that Corus fretting at his enemies valour, and calling to minde his former speeches, strooke so mightie a blow at him, that with the force thereof, he made him stagger, which turned Parismenos sences into such furie, that aduancing himselfe in his stirropes, he strooke Corus so full and so valiantly on the Crest, that he was astonish therewith: yet notwithstanding, with quick courage soon recouered his memorie again, prosecuting his blows with great fortitude, vntill that both their armor and steedes beganne to bee coloured with the purple blood that issued from their wounds: both of them waxing faint, yet neither willing to yeeld. Sometimes the one driuing his enemie to retire, and hee againe returning with new courage. But Parismenos being the nimbler of bodie, warded many of Corus blowes, and in the end wounded him so sore, that hee beganne to stagger too and fro, to saue himselfe from his furie, who still pursued him with such violence, that Corus with faintnesse fel on his horseneck: which he espying, was lifting his sword to fetch a fresh blowe to ende his life, but that he heard one call to him to staye, and looking back, saw that it was Amasenus : who missing him, being tolde that he departed from the Castle in armour, followed him to the place, and had all that while stayed couertly and beheld the combat, and seeing the daunger Corus was in, desired Parismenos to spare his life, who according to his request desisted. Amasenus then caused his knights to take vp Corus fallen from his horse in a trance, who receiuing fresh ayre, came to himselfe againe: but when he saw the Duke present, and his enemie still mounted and in good estate, his heart was readie to burst with inward greefe, which malicious rancour filled vp all his sences, that cursing himselfe and his ill fortune, he yeelded vp his fainting ghost. Farewell quoth Amasenus ) the most proude and discourteous knight that euer liued in Thrace , thy insolencie and malicious discontented enuie, hath wrought thine owne downfall. And most noble Knight (quoth hee) to Parismenos , I both honour your valour, and applaude your victorie, wherein you haue behaued your selfe so valiantly, as I shall for euer loue you: and since you remaine victor, I praye returne with me to haue your wounds cured. Parismenos humbly thanking him departed: and the rest of Amasenus Knights tooke vp Corus bodie, which afterwards they buried with great solemnitie. After Corus death, the Knights that enuied Parismenos , now beganne to imagine assuredly, that this Knight would darken all their glories, and the more account they saw the D. make of him, the more their malicious enuie increased, that they deuised all the meanes they coulde to contriue his death, whatsoeuer ensued thereon, waiting all opportunities. But hee hauing his wounds fully cured, forsooke his chamber, and betooke himselfe again to his wonted exercises, which was, sometimes to mannage the sturdie steede, and somtimes to sporte himselfe (in company of his vnknowne enemies) amongst the Ladies and Gentle women, who liked his behauiour and courtesie so well, besides his comely proportion, the sweete youthe so greatly pleased their fancies, that they accounted the Thracian Knights rude in respect of him, all both liking, louing, and commending him, and that so openly, that his enemies might heare their speeches, which wrought such a violent effect of rancor, that no thought could harbour in their brests, but tragicall deuises to worke his downfall. One amongst the rest, neare kinsman to Corus , named Argalus , was forwardest in this exployt, who to further his intent with one Themides , dissembling a friendly countenance, insinuated themselues into his familiaritie, vsing such kind behauiour towards him, and entertaining his company with such curtesie, that (he hauing no insight into their dissimulation) beganne to make account of their friendship, and to take delight in their company, oftentimes imparting his secretes vnto them, and without suspition, making them priuie to most of his actions. Argalus vpon a time came to Parismenos , telling him that a squire of his had found a mightie wild Bore, and could bring them to his den, desiring his company to go with them to hunt him. Parismenos hearing that, was as forward as any of them, and the next morning appointed to meete them in the midst of the Forrest, at the Pooles side. And early the next morning he got vp, according to his appointment, being readie to depart his Chamber, some fiue or sixe droppes of blood suddenly fell from his nose, with which he started, and staying, felt a suddaine drowsie heauinesse and throbbing, possesse his heart, which draue him into a deepe studie what should be the cause of that vnwonted passion: at last he began to think with himselfe, May not these fewe drops of blood deuine some bad successe to my enterprise this day? I am here in a straunge Country, amongst such as I know not how to trust, for I see apparantly many of them do enuy me, which they manifest by their lowring countenances, and Corus behauiour may be a patterne of their dispositions: therefore I were best not to go at all. Then again he began to thinke, Argalus and Themides are my friends, then what neede I feare any mishap? All which doubts would not staie him, but arming himselfe, and resoluing to endure all mischaunces, he departed towards the Poole. By the way as he rode, he met a damsell posting towards him with great speede, wringing her hands, and making great lamentation. Parismenos maruelling at her sorrow, asked the cause of her complaint. Sir knight (quoth she) I was going to Duke Amasenus court, carrying a present, and a letter from my Mistresse, vnto a strange knight that lately arriued there: but by ye way, I met with two knights in greene Armour, who dispoyled me thereof, and most disloyally offered to abuse me, had I not fled. Damsell (quoth he) bring me if you can where they are, and I will do my best to cause them make you restitution. Wherewith the Damsell turned her horse, and rode back againe. Sir Knight (quoth she) they tooke downe this narrow Lane. Parismenos set spurs to his horse, and with great speed rode that way. He was not farre entred, but he espied the two knights in greene Armor, readie mounted, staying in a pleasant valley, incompassed round with woods, vnto whom he thus saide: Is it the maner of you Thracians, to offer violence to silly Damsels? Render me those things you haue taken fro her, or I protest I will not leaue you, vntil I haue compeld you to do it by force. Unto whom one of them replied: If thy selfe art no Thracian, what doest thou here? or what interest hast thou in that Damsels quarrell, that maketh thee so bold to controwle our doings? That interest I haue (quoth he) as all knights should haue, which is to succor distressed Damsels: wherewith turning back to take scope for his race, he ran at one of them, and at the encounter, ouerthrew him backwards, who by mischance in the fall, burst one of his armes. The other seeing his fellowes mischance, assailed Parismenos with his sword drawne: whom Parismenos so ouerlaid with fierce blows, and wounded so greeuously, that he fearing his death, and seeing no other come to his rescue, was readie to yeeld. Euen at that instant another knight came, who seeing one of them dead, and the other in great danger, ranne at Parismenos , with intent vnawares to pearce his spears through his bodie: But he hearing the noyse of his horse feete behinde him, nimbly spurd his horse forwards, by which meanes the knight lost his course, passing by without doing him any harme. Parismenos looking about him, and espying two enemies more, and missing the Damsell that had brought him thither, began to suspect some trechery: which thoughts, and the remembrance of the drops of blood yt fel from him that morning, added new courage to his valor, that reaching a furious blow at the wounded knight, the sword lighting on a broken place in the armor, rusht into his bodie, and ended his life. By which time the two knights lately come, assailed him both at once, betweene whom began a most cruell and dangerous fight, that all the earth was coloured with ye blood that issued from their wounds: and notwithstanding Parismenos was before sore wounded, yet he defended himselfe so couragiously, that his new come enemies could not indanger him, but with their owne disaduantage, who seeing his valour, and calling to mind Corus death, forsooke knightly chiualry, and vsed all villainous  & cowardly fight, the one sometimes behind him offring him a thrust, and when he turned to reuenge ye iniurious deede, the other did the like, that he perceiued they intended to murther him, which so inraged this gallat knight, that dashing his spurs into his trustie steeds sides, he rusht with such violence against one of them, that he bare him quite out of his saddle, whose foote stil hung in his stirrop, and his horse dragd him with violence vp and down the field, vntil ye stirrop burst, and he lay dead & dismounted. The other knight seeing his friends misfortune, wold haue fled, but Parismenos strooke such a violent blow vpon his head, that he lost his sences, but soone recouering himselfe againe, & thinking it better to die by his enemies sword, then to yeeld to his mercy, turned to Parismenos , vttring these speeches. Knight, if thou art well giue ouer, otherwise know, that notwithstanding my former shew of flight, it is ye least part of my thought, but I intend to try it out with thee to the vttermost. Quoth he again, no dissembling Thracian, account not me so base minded to leaue such a villain to breath any longer, that art not worthy of knighthood, much lesse to be esteemed amongest men: was it thy pollicie by subtiltie to betray my life? If I be not deceiued, I knowe thee by thy voyce, and thy name is Argalus , my counterfaited friend. Am I the Bore thou intendest to slaie? No Traytor Thracian, doo not thinke me so simple, but I perceiue thy trecherie, and well vnderstand thy drifts, nor doo thou thinke to escape my hands. This Knight indeed was Argalus , who hearing his words, was so ouercome with rage, that marking where his Armour was most broken, he gaue him such a violent thrust, that the purple blood followed his keene sword: which wounde was more deadly then all that he had before receiued, that bending all his forces to reuenge the same, he smote so fiercely and nimbly at Argalus , that in the ende with many greeuous wounds, he beate him from his horse, and lighting, puld off his helmet and knew him: with that he said, Argalus , what offence haue I done thee, that thou shouldest seek my death? or wherein did I euer merit other then friendship at thy hands? most vnkind dissembler, thou shalt receiue a fit reward for thy vilany, wherwith, feeling the smart of the wound he had lately giuen him oppresse his heart, he thrust his sword into his bodie, which ended his life, and sate downe weary with trauell, and so faint with effusion of blood, that his eyes began to dazle, and he fell downe vpon the earth, as one bereft of sence. Amasenus all that day missing the knight of Fame, began to suspect that some other challenge had caused him to depart so secretly, but hearing that Argalus and Themides were in his company, whom he thought loued him dearly, his care was somewhat diminished, but whe it grew towards night, and none of them yet returned, he then began vehemently to feare the worst, that calling for his steede, he presently rode forth well accompanied, commaunding one to poste this way, and another that way about the Forrest, to seeke the Knight of Fame, himselfe rode which way his fancie best perswaded him vnto, and by chance (directed by good fortune), he tooke directly towards the place where the Combat was fought, and as he passed by the narrow Lane that went downe the valley, he espied one of the steedes all bestained with blood, wandring without his Ryder, which strooke a sodaine feare to his hart, that ryding downe that Lane, he espied the dead bodies of mangeled knights, lye confusedly scattered vpon the earth, with gastly countenances, being the fearfullest spectacle that euer eye beheld. The first that he beheld was Themides , almost torne to peeces by his owne steede, with his foote still in the stirrope. Next he viewed the other two knights so greeuously mangled and wounded, that the teares with griefe gusht from his eyes in abundance. Next he came to Argalus , whose face was vncouered, whom he soone knew. And last of all, he came to Parismenos , who laie groueling with his face to the earth, still grasping his bloodie sword in his hand, whom he perceiued to gaspe for breath, that in all haste lifting vp his Beuer to giue him fresh aire, he knew him to be the knight of Fame, and perceiuing some life yet to remaine in him, he vnarmed him with his owne hands, and gently wrapt him vp close, that his wounds might not take aire, causing him to be carried to his Castle. The rest of the dead knights he likewise caused to be carried backe, which was done with great lamentations, and afterwards by his pointment were honourably buried. How the Knights returned without any newes of Violetta . Of the sorrowe Pollipus made for her absence, departing in her search. How Violetta hauing indured many miseries in Archas Castle, at last escaped from thence in Soranas disguise. The Bohemian knights, by commandement of Parismus , and the Thessalian knights for the affection they bare to Violetta , hauing posted through euery part of Bohemia , and made all diligent search, leauing no place vnsought, no means vnattempted, nor labour vnperformed to finde her: yet notwithstanding all their faithfull diligence, at last, returned without any newes of her at all: which renewed Pollipus sorrowes afresh, that but euen then had entertained a little quiet by Parismus perswasions. But when he saw Violetta was by no meanes to be heard of, nor any likelihood or comfort left for him euer to see her againe: neither knowing nor any way supposing, what shuld be become of her, his heart was so inwardlie ouercome with troublesome cogitations, and doubtfull cares, that he could neither resolue to seeke her, nor take any course to ease his minde: but rested like one vtterly giuen ouer, to forlorne and carelesse miserie, daylie frequenting those sollitary walkes where he left her, and hourely renewing his sorrowes, by the sad remembrance of her absence, vttering such mournfull plaints and sad lamentations, that the birds that haunted those vnfrequented places, seemed to mourn and lament with him. Sometimes accusing himselfe of negligence, to leaue her to pursue the Beare, blaming her, that would not stay his returne, and then againe, fretting his heart for accusing her. Sometimes thinking she was dead, and then againe, perswading himselfe she was aliue, then musing why shee did not returne to him, if she were aliue: that by contrarieties of doubts, he could adde no ease to his cares, nor rest to his heart, at last, hee determined to search throughout all Germanie and Greece , but hee would find her: for he assuredly thought she was not dead, being therto induced, for that he could not finde no likelihood thereof, being perswaded by Parismus , that some discourteous Knight had met with her, and so withheld her returne: that within fewe dayes (arming himselfe in a greene armour, which hee made of purpose, bearing this deuice, A knight pursuing a wild Beare ) hee left the Bohemian Court, making none priuie to his departure, but Parismus , (who determined not to stay long behinde him) whom we will leaue onwards of his iourney, and speake of Violetta , whom we left weake in Archas Castle. As soone as the two gentlewomen had conueyed her to her bed, with the comfortable means they vsed, shee began to be somewhat reuiued, and calling her sences to their woonted vses, began to make such doleful lamentations, that no heart was able to indure to heare them, without effusion of teares: oftentimes offering to do her selfe violence, but that she was hindred by the two gentlewomen: especially one of them, named Sorana , was so carefull ouer her, that she left not so much as a pinne about her, wherewith she might do her selfe harme: but when some three dayes were past, and the extremitie of her desperate passion somewhat calmed, she began to desire, that Archas would conuey her to the Bohemian Court: if not to finde Pollipus , yet to enioy the comfortable presence of Parismus and Laurana : but notwithstanding her manifold intreaties, they vsed some excuses or other, to frustrate her expectation, telling her, that it was dangerous for her to trauell yet, by reason of her late sicknesse, and that since it was certaine Pollipus was no more to be enioyed, she might stay with them some fewe daies, vntill she were better able to indure so long a iourney: for that the Bohemian Court was not so neare as she thought. Which excuses, rather increased her desire, and the more she seemed desirous to go thither, the more they defrauded her by excuses many dayes. In which time, she being indued with an extraordinary wisedome, hauing well waighed each circumstance of her bringing thither, and their friuolous excuses, to deteine her there: and withall, noting their behauiours and speeches, began to suspect Archas dissimulation: to finde out the truth thereof, she began (contrary to her inward thoughts) to frame a cheerefuller countenance, and comfortabler disposition, thereby to feele their intents, which wrought such effect, that within a while, Archas would often frequent her company, and in the end, profered loue to her, vsing her most kindly, carefully and tenderly, seeming aboue all things, to regarde her quiet and content, whose speeches shee indured quietly, and took in good part (as he thought) that vpon a time, amongst many speeches, taking her by the hand, hee said: Most beautifull Lady, I haue euer since the first viewe of those excellent bewties, beene tormented with the passions of entire loue, that I could take no quiet, but in the sweete remembrance of your perfections, which haue bound my deuotions to your seruice, in such firme and constant leagues, that my resolution is, to spend my life (if it were a thousand times dearer to mee then it is) onely to procure your content: therefore, thus boldlie I presume to reueale my affections, trusting your clemencie will adde same ease to my carefull heart, by shewing some curteous signe of your fauourable acceptance of my humble sute: and though my merit hath no way deserued such fauour, yet I beseech you, make tryall of my loyaltie, and you shall finde I will be inferior to none in good will, nor violate my protested loyaltie in any vndutifull respect: I haue the boldlier presumed to detaine you here, because with your absence my life would depart: then consture not amisse of that true loue and sincere affection which hath caused me to offend in, but no offence at all, if you vouchsafe not to take it so: here shal you inioy your fill of content, in as ample sort as any other place can yeelde: then I beseech you graunt some ease to my troubled heart, and by your clemencie release mee of those cares that possesse my brest, onelye procured by the piercing dart of your sacred beautie. Which words beeing ended, hee offered to haue kist her, but shee gentlie refusing the same, made this replie. Syr knight, my sorrows will not suffer me to beleeue your speeches, nor my late losse, permit me to entertaine your loue: for then might you esteeme me light, and so lightly wonne, as little regard me: but to put you out of suspence, my resolution is, neuer to loue any but my deare Pollipus : wherewith the Christall teares with a violent passage, fell from her griefe swollen eye-balls. That griefe quoth he, is remedilesse: therefore bannish the sad remembrance thereof, from your heart, and entertaine a perswasion of my constancie, and true affection, which shal euerlastingly remaine inuiolable, without intermission. How can I (quoth she) in conscience, and without euerlasting staine to my honour, when I haue neither performed his funerall, nor shewed any token of dutie to his dead corps, who loued me most dearely in his life time. But shew me this fauour, as to let me but returne to the Court to bewaile his death, and a while enioy my deare friendes company, and I promise and protest next Pollipus , to leue none but your selfe. Archas hearing her reasonable demaund, stoode like one amazed, not knowing what aunswere to make her, thinking that if hee shoulde denie her that request beeing so small, she might thinke his loue but slender: and if hee shoulde promise her, and not performe it, that might bee a meanes to breede a suspition in her that his reports to her were false: that he stoode musing a great while confounded in his thoughts, what to deuise for a ready aunswere. Nay studie not so for that (quoth Violetta ) but aunswere me an other time. Which said, she withdrew her selfe vnto her chamber, where she began to meditate of his speeches, and how he was astonished, when she requested him to conuey her to the court, which draue her into many cogitations, when presently one of the gentlewomen came to her, whom she vsed most kindlie, and of purpose to feele her minde, grew into familiar conference with her: & amongst many other speeches (quoth she) I pray tell me what Archas hath reported vnto you, concerning Pollipus , for he seemeth vnwilling to vtter his minde vnto me? He told me nothing quoth she. Which words, came from her with such stuttering, and change of countenance, that Violetta began to suspect, that Archas had all that while dissembled with her, and that Pollipus contrary to his report) was yet liuing. And when Sorana came, she likewise felt her minde, of whom she gathered some probabilitie: and likewise, when she next came into Archas company, she asked him so many questions, that she found many contrarieties in his speeches, which setled such a perswasiue opinion in her minde, that Archas report of Pollipus was vntrue, that she rested greatly comforted that way, but yet in great care, cogitating what he shuld suppose was become of her, how she shuld get out of that place, or giue him knowledge of her being there, and auoyd Archas odious loue, which seemed as deadly to her heart, as infectious venome. Archas still prosecuted his sute with great earnestnesse, making many friuolous excuses to withhold her from the Bohemian court, growing into such boldnesse, that oftentimes when she refused his offered embracings and impudent behauiours, he would by force kisse her, and fold her in his armes, which rudenesse, he so often vsed, that she began so extreamely to abhorre him, that his sight was most odious vnto her. Oftentimes Violetta did walke into a pleasant Orchard adioyning to the Castle, as well to recreate her dulled sences in those pleasant shades, as in sollitarinesse to recount her miseries, and ease her carefull heart, by inuenting meanes how to ridde her selfe from forth that laborinth of sorrow, and also to auoyde Archas odious sight, who inwardly lusted to satisfie his inordinate appetite, by obtaining the fruition of her dilicate body: and though he knew Pollipus were liuing, and heard the mones and sorrowfull complaints Violetta made, able to extenuate any tyrannous dispositio, yet he persisted in his diuellish resolution, with such impudency, that neither regarding her complaints, nor the lawes of nature, he still sought all disloyall opportuniteis to dishonor her. And one time, marking when she went into the Orchard, as she was wont, in middest of her silent cogitations, he came to the place where she sate, (whose hart began to pant with a kinde of feare, when she beheld him) and comming vnto her, seating himselfe close by her sweet side, he vttered these speeches. You know deare Ladie, how long I haue sued to obtaine your loue, being thereto compelled by the extremities of loues euerlasting flame, which boileth in my troubled brest, but hitherto you haue obdurated your heart against me, and not vouchsafed to yeelde any pitty to my distresse, but contrary to the kinde nature which should abound in you, seeme not at all to regard my passions, which hath added sorrow to my torment. Now sweete Lady, seeing with what deuotions I haue attended your pleasure, defer me no longer, but let me obtaine that fauour, which with such care I haue expected, and you so vnkindly withheld: which wold both ease my comfortlesse heart, and adde no small content to the remedilesse sorrowes you so impatiently indure. Violetta hearing his speeches, made this replie. Sir, I haue long since told you my resolutio, which might be a sufficient answer to any reasonable creature: besides, my vows passed to my deare knight Pollipus , haue bound me from yeelding my spotlesse honour to be stained with the blot of infamie. Then I pray leaue off to prosecute your sute, which you ground vpon loues foundation, being indeede, nothing but the insatiate desire of filthy concupisence, the remembrance whereof, addeth new care to my carefull heart, and euery way affrighteth me with discontent: and if you so much regard my content, as you protest, desist to trouble me with your loue, and giue me leaue to depart from hece, that I may spend the rest of my daies in sorrow, for his losse, that was more deare vnto me, then all the worlds treasure. I but Lady quoth Archas , calme this discontent with remembrance of an impossibilitie in obtaining ought at his hands, and goe not about to cosume those heauenly perfections with sorrow, & seeme not stranger then reason requireth, to him that loueth you as well as Pollipus euer did: and now that occasion hath so fitly offered the sweete opportunitie of time and place, let vs spend this time in loue, and not in these contentions: these vnfrequented pathes adde meanes to further our ioyes: here are no eyes to behold vs, nor any to bewray our secrets, but the silent trees & sweete smelling flowers: & that which is vnknown, is in a maner vncommitted: and in requital of your kindnesse, I wil performe whatsoeuer you shall command me, were it to run through thousands of deathes, to procure your content: the sweet loue be not so vnkind, but yeeld some pittie to my restlesse cares, and detaine not from mee that pleasant delight, which will extinguish my bitter griefes. When he had ended his speeches, he stricktly caught her tender body in his arms imprinting a compelled kisse vpo her tender lips, twining her curled locks about his grosse fingers, and boldly fingring her tender brests, offering other forced behauiour: whilest she striued to vntwine her body off his armes, which when she had obtained, casting a disdainfull countenance vpon him like as Diana cast vpon the wofull Acteon ) with her cheekes as red as scarlet, she vttered these speeches. Most discourteous villaine, hath my leuitie inforced thee to offer me this abuse: or is thy minde so far from pietie, as not to desist from prosecuting thy detested lust? know this, that rather then I will yeelde my honour to bee blemished by thy appetite, I will teare these eyes from forth my head, and ende my woful life, which thou soughtest to spill. Is this the friendship thou hast protested? was it thy pollicie to traine mee hither to dishonour mee? hadst thou left me in the place where I lost my beloued, then had I beene happie, if some wilde beast had ended my life. I now perceiue thy protestations are but filthy actors of thy intended villanie, and all which thou hast tolde me of Pollipus death, to be most false and vntrue: for no doubt, he is yet liuing, whom thou seekest to dishonour, by dispoyling me of that which I reserued for him. Accursed wretch that I was, to fal into thy odious hads, which art voyde of knightlie behauiour. Archas hearing himselfe thus reuiled, abandoned shame and pitie, violentlie pulling her to him: tolde her, that she should submit her selfe to his will, offering by force to attaine the fruition of her spotlesse body. When Violetta felt her selfe so handled, she laboured by all meanes to disappoint him of his will: but in the ende, feeling her selfe too weake, long to withhold his force, she yeelded forth such shrikes, as all the Castle roong with the noyse of her entrie: that Sorana hearing the same, knowing the place where she vsed, came thitherwards. Archas beholding her, withdrew himselfe, and Violetta rose from the place, tyred with resistance, and swolne with inward vexation and disdain, to be so vsed, casting her countenance down to the earth: to whom Sorana said: How now Lady, what causeth your sorrow? hath Archas offered you violence? Violetta with teares trickling downe her crimsen cheekes, answered: yea, that villaine Archas would haue done me violence, had not you so fortunately come to my rescue: but I thanke the diuine prouidence, that hath sent you so happily to preserue mee from his deuouring lust, whose dishonourable minde is fraught with all villanies: accursed be the day that first brought me to this hatefull place, to fall into his loathsome power, that contrary to nature, hath done me this outrage. Sweet Sorana (quoth she) conuey me secretly into the Castle, that there I may in sorrow end my accursed life: rather then againe abide his loathsome sight, which will be as pestilent as deadly poyson to my heart. Sorana taking her by the arme to support her weake body, led her to her Chamber. Archas likewise seeing himselfe so frustrated of his desire, with an impudent and vnshamefast countenance, went into the Castle, vowing in his heart neuer to desist vntill he had accomplished his desire. Violetta being come to her chamber, related to Sorana the whole manner of Archas vsage, intreating her counsaile which way to auoyd his sutes, which she knew he wold still prosecute: who vttered her mind in this sort. Lady, I pittie your estate, but am so far from adding release thereto, as I know no meanes at all how to comfort you: for Archas disposition, I too well know, is far from any sparke of honestie, who hath in like sort behaued himselfe to mee at my first comming hither, which was in the prime of my youth: neither giue any credit to his reports: for he hath tolde me, that Pollipus is yet liuing, and long since I suspected he would vse you in this sort, and escape from hence you cannot: for this Castle is continually guarded, hauing but one entrance thereto, whereby none can escape vndescried: therefore I thinke it best for you to yeelde to his loue, and then you may liue in quiet: otherwise, I know your life will be miserable inough. Violetta was stricken into a suddaine amazement to heare her detested counsaile, thinking to haue found some comfort in her speeches: insomuch, that with extremitie of passion, she was ready to giue vp the ghost. Which Sorana beholding, reuiuing her with rubbing her pale cheekes, she said, as followeth. If you will follow my aduise and counsaile, I may peraduenture ease you in some respect, which is this: That the next time when Archas againe sollicites his sute, condiscend to his request, conditionally, that he will come to you in the silent of the night, so secretly that none may know thereof, and that onely he satisfie himselfe with your loue, without asking questions, or entring into any talke, which may renew the remembrance of your former griefe: and when with these conditions, you haue agreed, my selfe will supplie your roome: and therby safegard your honor, and satisfie him: which may well be performed, considering that his desire being nothing but lust, he easily will be drawn to condiscend to your conditions: which once done, let me alone to execute the rest: for I am so well acquainted with his fashions, that it shall be long before he discrie our deceit. Violetta hearing the circumstance of her talke, promised to do all things according to her counsaile, if she her self ment faithfullie. Which Sorana assured her of, by many protestations, and so left her in some comfort, hoping by this meanes, to bee ridde from her impudent louer. Assoone as Sorana was departed, she presently goeth to Archas (pricked forwards with as great a sting of foule lust, as raigned in him) and told him, that she had talked with Violetta about his sute, which she was perswaded she would yeeld vnto, but that she was bashful: & by his speeches, rather hardned, then any way mollified: but (quoth she) try her euen now, and whatsoeuer she bindeth you vnto by condition, yt promise you to performe: and when you know her minde, tell me what she sayes, and I may peraduenture counsaile you what to do for your furtherance: for she is worthie to be beloued and kindlie vsed: and in my iudgement, you did amisse to vse her so rudely as you did in the Orchard: for forced kindnesse is not worth estimation, but consent in loue breedes the sweetest delight. Archas presently put her counsaile in practise, and came to Violettaes chamber (who was then studying how to rid her selfe from his custodie) and very kindly saluted her, crauing pardon for his last offence, excusing himselfe by many reasons, and alleaging as many perswasions, that she could not in reason deny his request, his loue being grounded vpon the truest foundation of perfect constancie, of vowes, oathes, and protestations, to dedicate himself, his life, and all that he had to be at her commaund. Violetta (casting downe her eies to the earth, and with a blushing countenance, to think how much it went against her heart, to vse him kindly: asking pardon of Pollipus , in her secret thoughts, for doing him that vnwilling wrong) at last made aunswere, that shee coulde in some sort bee contented to graunt his request, if he would promise to performe what she should inioyne him too: which he vowed and protested to fulfill in euery respect. Then she concluded with him as Sorana had counselled her to do, which liked him exceedingly well, and quoth shee, for a pledge heereof, giue me that ring which you so much esteem, which he gaue vnto her, and at his departure receiued from her a gentle kisse, which she wisht might prooue as deadly poyson to his heart, beeing greatly discontented with her selfe for shewing him that fauour. Archas presently with a ioyfull heart went to Sorana , and tolde her all that had passed betwixt him and Violetta : which she willed him in any wise to performe: and seeing she hath bound you from talke, what neede you care for speaking, sith you may enioy what otherwise you desire: & she finding you so willing to condiscend to her requestes, will bee the easiler drawne to yeelde you any courtesie. Sorana beeing parted from him, immediately came to Violetta , and tolde her all that he had made her priuie vnto, and withall said, that for her sake onely she vndertooke that taske, (which was nothing so, but of a most inordinate desire to beastly lust, which Violetta well noted:) and thus they spent the day in much ydle talke, vntill euening drawing nigh, shee left Violetta in her chamber, and went vnto that sweete bedde, which she had neatly drest for Archas , perfuming her selfe with many odoriferous waters, deuising all meanes she could to keep her selfe vnknown from him, being affected with great desire for his approach. Assoone as the appoynted time was come, Archas secretly conueyed himselfe in the darke, into Violettas chamber, without speaking a word, whom when Sorana heard rusling vppon the rushes, her heart leapt for ioy: and she prepared her selfe to entertaine him in the kindest sort, who approaching the beds side, softly lifting vp the clothes, laide himselfe downe by her side, who seemed to shrinke thereat, and with such cunning behaued her selfe, that he no whit supposed he embraced his woonted Sorana . Violetta beeing sure of Archas , with all haste attired her selfe in Soranas apparrell, which so well became her, that had Archas himselfe seen her, he would not haue discerned her disguise, & taking with her the ring he had giuen her, she came to the Gardiants, telling the she must go out about a little businesse for Archas , and gaue them the ring as her warrant to passe by. The Gardiants maruelled whither she went so late, yet taking her for no other then Sorana , accepting her warrant, let her depart. Violetta being past the entrance, beganne to studie which way to take, but knowing that the time now yeelded no respite to delaye, tooke any way came into her fancie, fittest as shee thought for her escape, and with all hast, arming her selfe with as much courage as could possibly be in a woman, forsaking the mountaines, which she thought daungerous for wilde beastes, she trauelled all that night, sometimes running, and sometimes going, as if Archas had bin hard at hand pursuing her, and by that time Phoebus beganne to illuminate the earth with his brightnesse, she was gotten a great way from Archas Castle, towards Greece , reioycing at her happie escape, not caring which way she went, so she might get from him: and applauding Soranas counsell, which had sorted to that vnexpected issue for her escape. How Pollipus was taken prisoner by the Gyant Brandamor , in the Forrest of Arde . And of Parismus departure with Tellamor and Barzallus , in search of Violetta . After that Pollipus was departed from Parismus , he came to the place where he left Violetta , and there vttered these speeches. This is that blessed place where my Loue lay last foulded in mine armes, whose presence was the sollace of my sweete content, whose perfections exceld the rarest gifts of other Ladies, as farre as good doth bad, or any vertue his contrarie: which way should I take to recouer that inestimable iewel of my delight here left? or whither should I trauell to finde her, considering I know not whether she bee dead or aliue? Dead I am perswaded she is not, but by some discourteous Knight withheld from returning, or conueyed far hence vnto some vnknowne place, fro whence she cannot send me word, or any way giue me knowledge in what estate she remaineth: then what resteth for me to do, but to search the world throughout to find her, and either to recouer her to my comfort, or spend my life in that pursuite: and since I vndertake a trauell, without knowledge which way to take, or whither to conuey my steppes, sweet Fortune be so fauourable, as to guide me in my trauels, that by thy ayde I may come to the place of her abode, and attaine the fruition of her heauenly presence, who by thy appoyntment, hath fallen into these mischances: and I will for euer dedicate my indeuours to thy seruice, and continually adore thy name. Which words being ended, he mounted himselfe on his steede, and rode the way his fancie first chose, trauelling towards the mountaines that incompasse Bohemia , but not finding her, being vnacquainted in those countries, wandred towards Grecia ,  & trauelled without any more hope to finde her, then at the beginning, continuing his trauels without intermission, passing many places without any misaduenture. At last he came to the great Forrest of Ardea , wherein stoode the Castle of the mightie Gyant Brandamor , the place being inuincible, by reason of the scituation and strength, whose cruelties committed by him and his brother Argaletus , made him much feared, and his walkes eschued of all men. Which Forrest Pollipus was no sooner entred, but he espied the bodie of a goodly Knight, that had lately giuen vp his ghost, lie weltred in his blood, which when he had well viewed, and perceiued to be quite past recouerie, he maruelled what sad aduenture had been cause of his death, perswading himself, those that had done the same were not far off, that he withdrew himselfe into a thicket of bushes, where he could not be discerned, to stay vntill he might descrie those that had done that deede. He had not been long shrowded there, but he saw a damzell and a squire, comming to the dead Knight, with great lamentations, bewailing his vntimely death, seeming by their behauiour, to be quite ouercome with extreame miserie. After their lamentations ended, they hasted to take vppe the dead Knight, to whom Pollipus came and demaunded what Knight that was, and what misaduenture had brought him to that vntimely death. The damzell casting her eyes vp to him, which before were sadly fixed on the earth, said. Sir Knight, to discouer the whole circumstance of our mishap, would aske more respite then the time will now permit: because if we be surprised by our tariance, wee are like to bee partners with him in death. This Knight was named Tyrides , sonne to the noble Duke Amasenus of Thrace , being brought vppe in the court of the renowned King of Libia , who being with the Princesse Venola , the kings onely daughter on hunting, in the middest of their pastime, she was seuered from the rest of her company, and being wet with following the game, alighted in a pleasant valley to coole her selfe, and lay downe on the flowring bankes of a sweete burbling brooke, where she had not long stayed, but she was supprised by a Gyant, who with rude behauiour brought her away: wherewith I being amazed, ranne backe to this woorthie knight Tyrides , who with mee and this Page, pursued him vntill we came to this place, where this noble Knight charged him to redeliuer the Ladie to him, who lay panting with extreame feare of her life vnder his guard: but the Gyant presently set vpon this Knight, and in long continuance of terrible fight: slewe him by which time many of her damsels had found vs out, whom hee with Venola , notwithstanding their earnest intreaties, conueyed to a castle not farre hence, whither we secretly followed him, and are now returned to carrie backe this knight, with this heauie newes to the king. Do not so quoth Pollipus , but bring me to the Castle, and thou shalt soone see I will set her at libertie, or venter my life. Sir (quoth the damzell) if I thought your trauel would sort to any good issue, I would conduct you thither, but the Gyant is now within the Castle, & the night neare approached, therefore we will depart with this dead knight: and if you please to go thither, you may easily finde it. Pollipus seeing her so vnwilling, left her, and rode towardes the Castle, which he found fast shut, whereto was one passing by a bridge, ouer a mightie huge deepe lake, the Castle it selfe being scituated vpon a loftie rocke, so well fenced by nature, and strengthened by the art of man, that it was vnconquerable, and not to be subdued by force: and comming to the bridge, he found the same drawn vp, by means whereof, he thought it vaine to account of any thing that night, but contented himselfe to take the cold earth for his bed, and the large Forrest for his chamber, where hee could take no rest, beeing troubled with many thoughts; hauing likewise some hope to finde Violetta in that place, which added (though it were verie vnlikelie) great courage to his resolution. That viewing the inuincible strength of the Castle, and well considering how he might disaduantage the Gyant, if he could get him to single fight, in these and such like thoughts hee spent most part of the night, vntill at last he laid him downe, and gaue a little slumber to his eyes. Early in the morning he buckled on his armour, and mounting his steede, shrowded himselfe vnder the shadow of an oake, not farre from the Castle, where he might easilie see who went out and in thereat. The first that came out that morning, was Argalte , mounted vppon a goodly Courser, and armed in very rich armour, whom Pollipus thought had beene the Gyant that the Damzell had tolde him of, whom he thus greeted. Traitor, art thou the Gyant of this Castle, which hast stolne the Ladie Venola ? Argalt hearing his peremptorie demaund, made this answere. I haue the Ladie Venola in my custodie, whom I esteeme aboue all the world, but no traitor as thou termest me. Yes (quoth Pollipus ) thou art a traitor, and woorse then a villaine, that disloyally offerest outrage to resistlesse Ladies, that haste not so much valour, as to shewe thy selfe before an armed Knight: but since my destinies haue alotted me to meete thee thus conueniently, I will abate thy pride, and correct thy tyrannie, and make thee repent the outrages thou haste committed. Argalt hearing his speeches, was so inraged, that suddainly hee drew foorth his mightie Fawchion, and as suddainely strooke a violent blowe therewith at Pollipus , which by the vnexpected approach, being vnresisted, glaunced on to his thigh, and pierced the armour, that the blood appeared. Pollipus seeing how treacherously hee had smitten him, drewe his sword and reuenged that blowe, beginning a braue and faire combat, which continued for a good space, vntill they had giuen each other many deepe wounds. Argalte maruelling at his enemies valour, beeing neuer before so roughly handled, laid on his blowes with mightie force, but Pollipus sometime nimbly auoyding one, and cunningly warding another, kept himselfe from any great harme, and in the end tired Argalt , who seeing that all his strength litle auailed to his enemies disaduantage, and withall, feeling himselfe almost wearied, beganne to abate his blowes, which Pollipus perceiuing gaue him so many blows, and withall, such deepe wounds, that he was in great daunger of his life: and turning his backe, fled towards the Castle, when Pollipus pursuing, gaue so many wounds, that he beganne to rore and crie exceedingly, yelling foorth such a hideous noyse, that all the Castle rung therewith. Brandamor hearing the same, presently hasted to his rescue, and lifting vp his mightie mace, vnawars strooke so forcibly therewith vppon Pollipus Crest, that it made him stagger, withall saying: Why offerest thou this outrage to my brother? Pollipus seeing his mightie proportion, beeing somewhat dazeled with the blowe, retired a little backe, and beeing recouered, made this aunswere. I neede not tell thee wherefore, for that thy guiltie conscience replete with vice, can bear witnesse of thy degenerate crueltie, offered to al that come within thy power, but especially to the faire Ladie Venola , whom thou (or thy brother) haste brought to this Castle, whom I am come to redeeme. Brandamor hearing his speeches, most cowardly assayled him, being before almost wearied, and greeuously wounded: who notwithstanding resisted him so valiantly, that Brandamor in short time had receiued many greeuous woundes, yet staying himselfe, said. I pittie thy estate, and therefore I wish thee to yeelde thy selfe, before I chastise thy boldnesse any further, for I see thou art alreadie wounded, and vnable to withstand my strength: besides, I scorne to cope with one alreadie vanquished: then take my offer of mercie, or else I will soone giue that weake bodie of thine to be deuoured of wilde beasts. Uaine boasting monster, (quoth Pollipus ) know, that I disdaine thy friendship, and disclaime thy proffer, desiring rather to die by thy cursed hand, then yeeld to thy courtesie, therefore do thy woorst. Brandamor hearing this resolute reply, being inraged with collor, strooke at him most violently, but Pollipus auoyding his blowe, thrust at him, and wounded him so deepe, that the blood ranne downe vppon his white steede. Argalt seeing this Knight so valiantly withstand his brother, called with a great sort of seruants in armour, who rushing all at once vppon him, with their throng beate him from his horse, and carried him into the Castle, where hee was vnarmed, and for that night put into a close prison, hauing an olde woman to dresse his wounds. Early the next morning, hee was brought into the Hall before Brandamor , who had Maiestically seated himselfe in a chaire, with firie redde eyes swolne with rage, vttering these speeches. Presumptuous and euerdaring Knight, what frenzie hath caused thee to commit this vnaduised folly, whereby thou hast incenst my wrath against thee, and brought thy selfe in daunger? Wherein haue I wronged thee, that thou shouldest offer to molest me? Pollipus disdaining to be so peremptorily examined, made this reply. I list not tell my name, because thou knowest me not, the cause of my comming hither, is in search of a Ladie that I suppose thou vniustly detainest, making thy infamous name so ignominious by thy outrages, that both heauen and earth will shortly hate thee. Doest thou seeke a Ladie (quoth he) come with me, and thou shalt see all the Ladies I haue. Then hee brought him into a goodly Hall, hung with auncient clothes of Tapistrie, out of which he went into a most pleasant Gallerie, furnished with al sorts of most beautiful pictures of excellent workmanship: from thence he came into a chamber of great largenesse, so rarely furnished, as Pollipus maruelled at the richnesse thereof: at the end whereof, sate the most beautifull and faire Ladie Venola , with her golden hayre hanging about her shoulders, her rich and costly ornaments all betorne, her crimson cheekes besprinckled with olde dried teares, and fresh droppes flowing from her pure eyes: heauily leaning her carefull head vpon a cushion, with her hands hanging downe folded one in another, seeming so sadde and heauie a spectacle of a distressed Ladie, as neuer eye beheld: who seeing Brandamor and Pollipus comming toward her, lifted vp her head from the place where she rested it, and carelessly let the same fall on the heauie pillow againe. Pollipus seeing her exceeding beautie, and withall, noting her heauie estate, was strooken into a suddaine dumpe, that he stood like one in a studie. Brandamor thinking that was the Ladie he came to redeeme, sayd Knight, if this be the Ladie thou seekest to release, thy labour is in vaine: for her do I esteeme more then all the world: whose presence I so highly honour, that no force shall redeeme her from hence: whom I both loue and honour, as much as thou and all the Knights in the world besides: whose loue hath caused my languishing torments this long time, which now I purpose to enioy, to the extinguishing of my inward vexations: for her sake haue I indured much trauell, then do not think, that I will easily or willingly leaue her heauenly company, but wil approoue and maintaine, that I am woorthier of her loue then any Knight liuing: and since I haue my desire in attaining her custodie, I will likewise enioy her loue before she part hence. Venola hearing his proude boasting, so much disdained them, that shee could not refraine from answering him, but rising from the ground where she sate, shee vttered these speeches. Impudent miscreant, why presumest thou so much of thy selfe, that art able to performe nothing but bragges? thinkest thou my loue of so small estimation, as to be controlde and conquered by thy vaine speeches? or any way to yeeld liking to thy detested Karcasse: no, I account the basest trull in Libia , too good to bee thy Paramour, much lesse my selfe do so much scorne thee, that I will rather execute mine owne death, then suffer thee to defile me so much as with a touch: and thinkest thou because thou haste betraied this one knight by treacherie, there are no other that will seeke my release? Yes be thou assured, that the violence thou haste offered mee, by bringing me hither against my will, one day will turne to be the occasion of thy cruell death. Thou foule detested villaine, leaue off to vtter such bosting speeches in my presence, for nothing can bring more greefe to my heart, then thy ill pleasing sight. Brandamor hearing her heauenly voyce sound foorth such bitter taunts against him, was exceedingly inraged therewith, but dissembling a pleasant countenance, hee departed with Pollipus , whom after some speeches past betwixt them, hee commaunded to bee conueyed to a chamber, from whence he could as hardly get, as from the strongest prison in the world: who seeing that Violetta was not in the Castle, wisht he had not attempted to haue come there, but making a vertue of necessitie, he indured his imprisonment as patiently as might be, thinking all miserie nothing, being vndergone for Violettas sake. Where we will leaue him, to speake of Parismus . Parismus heart was opprest with such greefe, for the losse of the vertuous Violetta , and the absence of his deare friend Pollipus , that day nor night, hee could neither by sleepe, or other recreation, giue any ease to his troubled head: therefore he determined likewise, to indure some trauell for their sakes, that had suffered much miserie in his behalfe: and when Laurana and he were one night sweetly solacing themselues, each in the others pleasant loue, he tolde her his full intent, desiring her not to be discontented therewith, but to take his departure patiently. Laurana hearing his speeches, was so ouercome with greefe, that a flood of teares distilled from her precious eyes, and twining her tender armes about his necke, empressing a sweete kisse vpon his lips, shee vttered these speeches. Most noble Lord, are you wearie of my company, that you seeke to estraunge your selfe from mee by trauell? do you thinke I shall be able long to endure your absence, well knowing how many dangers may hazard your person, and detain your heauenly presence from my sight? thinke you that I can attaine any quiet, without the fruition of your heauenly company? or euer suffer sleepe to seize vpon my eyes while you are absent? No sweet Lord, with your departure, all ioy and delight shall part from me, and neuer will I suffer any content to harbour in my brest. Then most deare Loue, which words she vttered, intermingled with a number of sweete kisses do not leaue me in care, do not withhold my content, do not take away my sweetest delight, but staie you stil with me, and commaund your knights to go in Violettas search, who at the least becke, wil poste through the worlde to do you seruice: and hazard not your person in strange Countries, nor amongst forraine enemies, which may by some trecherie worke your griefe: my self wil here shrowde you from harme: my armes shall inclose you from danger, and my loue shall be the Fort you shall conquer. I wil expel the sad remembrance of their losse, with delightful communication: my selfe wil rocke your sences a sleep with Musicke, and my indeuours shal labor to purchase your content: then do not seeke to leaue me comfortlesse to bewaile your absence, but make abode with me ful, and my loue shall shelter you from all peril. Which words being ended, the ouerflowing of her teares, stopt the passage of her speech, and sobbing forth sighes, she hung about his necke. Parismenos was exceedingly greeued to see her heauinesse, that fowlding her precious bodie in his armes, with a strict imbracing, he laboured by delightful familiarities, to expel her sadnesse: which being somewhat mittigated, he vttered these speeches. Why deare Ladie, what need you make these complaints, considering you know nothing is so precious in my sight, nor of so dear estimation with me, as your sweete loue? Or what neede you make speech, or take such feare of dangers, when you see no cause of disquiet? Why are you vnwilling that I should take a litle paines for their sakes, that wold haue many wayes indangered their liues, and endured extreame miserie for your sake? How can I excuse my selfe of ingratitude, to that curteous knight Pollipus ? if whilest he passeth his tune in sorrowfull care, I should liue here in ease, not seeming to regard his misery, that would haue shunned no danger to procure my comfort? How wil all the knights of this Court esteeme of me, but as of an ingrateful person, if I should so much neglect the dutie of a friend? Then sweete Loue, be not you the cause of my stay, but let me obtaine your sweet consent, and expell those confused cares that trouble your quiet: for be you assured, nothing can be more greeuous vnto me, then your discontent: and nothing more pleasing, then your accord: the dangers accurrant to trauel, are wisedome easily auoyded: then be you assured, that I will shun all hazard of mishap, for your sweete sake: and leaue you off to sorrow thus, for that which you cannot with equitie contradict: my stay shall not bee long, nor my iourney far: then be you contented to vouchsafe your agreement, and you shall thereby satisfie my content: his speeches being ended, with silence she gaue consent, spending some time in sweet dalliance, and in the end, fell fast a sleepe. Early in the morning, Parismus with many sweet kisses, tooke his leaue of Laurana , who bedewed her bed with abundance of teares, for his departure, and falling into a deepe passion of feare, she presently started vp, and arraying her selfe, came downe into the court, where Parismus was readie to take his horse, & running to him, caught hold of him, who maruailing thereat, tooke her most louingly in his arms, who was so far ouergon with griefe, that she could not speake a word: but bestowing many sweete tear-wet kisses on her, hee left her amongst her maids, and departed. With him, were Tellamor and Barzillus , keeping company togither some three dayes, without aduenture at all: at last, they came to a goodly plaine, wherinto, a common beaten path conducted them, vntill comming to the middest thereof, there stood a brazen pillar, from which, parted three seuerall waies: there they stayed deuising amongst themselues, which of those wayes to take: at last, they concluded, that each of them should take a seuerall way, and solemnly taking their leaues, with kinde farewells, they betooke each other to their good or bad fortunes. How Parismenos called the knight of Fame , woon the chief honor of the Tourney, at the Court of the King of Thrace . And hauing won Phylena the Kings daughter, was commaunded in a vision, to giue her to Remulus . Parismenos (no otherwise knowne, but by the name of the Knight of Fame , vnder which name, he did passe till he came to the knowledge of his parets) being as is before said in another Chapter, coueied by Amasenus to his castle, sore wounded in the battel he had with Argalus and Themides , was so carefully tended by the Dukes Phisitians, that in a fewe daies they had brought him to his perfect remembrances: and within short time after that, to his former health, which greatly reioyced the good old Duke, who tooke great felicitie in his company, for the many honourable parts he saw to abound in him. And vpon a time, in the presence of all his Court, demanded the cause of the combat between him and Argalus , which he requested as well to know the truth thereof himselfe, as to satisfie the suspitious mindes of many that inwardly maligned the discontented Knight, vnto whom he declared the truth in maner as is before set downe, saying: This my lord, is the truth of our misadueture, whom I neuer iniuried, but alwaies esteemed as my deare friends. Amasenus was glad that no cause of discontent could be conceiued against him, by any other of his knights, who enuied him, because his noble gifts darkened their glories: but yet his curteous  & kind behauiour in short time expelled that rancor, & they that before were his enemies, began to make good estimation of him, and his fame began to spred it selfe in most parts of Thrace , and all that euer beheld him, grew into admiration of his strength, accopanied with such bewtie, as his youth yeelded; that had they not knowne the contrary by his prowesse, they would haue taken him for some disguised Lady. Whilest the knight of Fame remained in Amasenus court, the King of Thrace appointed a generall triumph, to be held for certaine dayes, the occasion whereof, is this. He had one onelie daughter, named Phylena , whose bewtie was inferior to none: and her gifts of nature were such, as made her much spoken of in many countries: insomuch, that many knights came as sutors to obtaine her loue: but she had secretly betrothed her selfe to Remulus , one of the knights of her fathers court, without her parets consent: by meanes of whose bewtie, the court of Thrace was so ful of gallant knights that sought her loue, that the king was much troubled in minde how to bestow her: and seeing that she did not fancie one more then another, he appointed a generall triumph to be held for seue daies, and whosoeuer bare away the prize ye last day, shuld marrie his daughter. Intending thereby to end his doubt and care that way: thinking, that though his daughter had not a rich and Princely husband, yet she should haue a valiant Champion to defend the price of her beautie. Amongst the rest of the Knights, there was Guido , who had long time sued to obtaine her loue, who now reioyced at this decree, hoping by his valour to beare away the bride. There was Trudamor of Candie , who thought none to equall him in strength, and therefore none more forward against the appointed Tryumph. There was Drio of Cicil , who had sailed from his owne Country thither, who likewise by his strength, at seuerall times, slew three Lyons, who came with resolution to winne Phylena for his wife. And many other knights of high account. The report of this Tryumph came to the knowledge of the knight of Fame, whose minde was kindled with a great desire to goe thither, that he requested Amasenus consent, who being desirous any way to pleasure him, gaue him sufficient coyne to furnish himselfe of all things fit for such an attempt. Who caused a most rich Armor of greene to be made, shadowed with trees of gold, representing a Forrest. In his shield he bare this deuice: A naked man leading a Lyon, with this motto vnderneath. Ouergrowne with discontent . Wherin the expert Artsman had so cunningly immitated his Fancie, that a man by his Armor and shield, might easily vnderstand his meaning. The appointed time of Tryumph drawing nigh, Amasenus with a gallant troupe of knights, amongst whom the knight of Fame was chiefe, came to the Thracian Court, whom the king honourably receiued. Amasenu hauing done his homage to the king, pitched his Tent without the Court Gates, vpon a litle hill hard by the appointed place for Tryumph, where likewise hard by him were the Tents of Guido, Trudamor, Drio , and the three valiant knights of Candie : Tristamus, Tennulus , and Babulus , in whose company were a number of valiant knights, that came thither, some to make triall of their valour, and some of purpose to winne the faire Phylena . Likewise there were the Tents of the young king of Aragon : who came accompanied with a number of valiant knights, hoping to beare away the prize, that all the plaines were filled with Tents. There might you see knights breaking staues, practising themselues against the day of Tryumph. Here might you see other recreating themselues in martiall exercises: there might you heare the neighing of horses, clattering of Armour, cracking of staues, and such companies of knights assembled, as if the richest prize in the world had bene appointed for reward. Whilst these things were acting, Phylena was in great care fo Romulus , whom she loued so dearely, that rather then shee would part with him, she would indure any miserie whatsoeuer: who likewise addressed himselfe to trie his fortune amongst the rest. And the day before the triumph, Phylena secretly getting opportunitie to speak with him, gaue him this assurance of her constancie. My deare loue quoth she, since my father hath decreed this publicke triumph, for the bestowing of mee in marriage, because amongst so many knights as haue sought my loue, I haue affianced my selfe to none of them, but haue chosen you, as the chiefest loadstarre of my life and loue: be you yet assured, that though fortune may alot me to bee anothers by conquest, yet none but your selfe shall enioy my loue: and though another may challenge me by right of my fathers decree, yet none but your selfe shall haue true interest in me: and rather then I will yeelde to like of any knights loue but yours, I will indure either death, or any other torment shall be inflicted vpon me, for you are the knight that shall conquer my loue: you haue by courtesie wonne my loue, and you shall weare it. Nor king nor Knight shall robbe mee of that which I haue giuen to you: then be not you discomforted, or any way disquieted, but trie your fortune amongst the rest, and fate may happily allot you the conquest as well as any other. Remulus hearing his Ladies constant resolution, was ouercome with exceeding ioy, resoluing to venture as much as any, to attaine the conquest, and solacing himselfe so long as their stolen time would permit in her company, beeing by necessitie compelled, they parted. The next morning, the King of Thrace accompanied by a number of personages of estate, brought forth the beautifull and faire Phylena , most richly adorned with costly ornaments, wearing vppon her head a crowne of golde, attended by a hundreth Damzels clad in white, and seated her on a scaffold, in the open view of all the Knights there assembled, whose hearts were inamoured with the sweete attaint of her shining beautie, and their courages reuiued with the hope of so rich and precious a prize. Amongst the rest, there was Remulus , whose heart was opprest with distrustfull care, to see the Ladie hee most esteemed: and his secret protested loue, set as a prize, to wring him fro his possession: yet comforted by her faithfull promise, hee tooke great felicitie to see that beautie made famous, which he made account to enioy. The knights of Thrace beganne the triumph, and the first that entred the listes was Andreas , who was at two courses vnhorsed by Cleauthes , who continued conquerour by the ouerthrowe of many Knights, vntill Bubulu , one of the three brethren of Candie , with violence draue him from his horse, and burst one of his ribbes. Bubulus vnhorsed many Knights afterwards, both of Thrace and other straunge countries, and in the end, was vnhorsed himself by Remulus , who behaued himselfe so valiantly in the sight of the Princes, that by the foyle of many Knights, hee ended that daies triumph, to his exceeding honour, resting conquerour vntill the next morning. When the night was ouerpast, the King conducting Phylena in the like manner hee had done the day before, seated her againe vpon the scaffold. When Remulus came into the listes, brauely mannaging his prauncing steed, whom Phylena beheld with a carefull eye, breathing foorth many a deuouted prayer for his good successe, who hauing conquered some twentie Knights, in the end was foyled by Temulus , and so with a heauie heart left the field. Temulus continued conquerour by the disgrace of many knights, almost all that day, but in the ende, was vnhorsed by the king of Aragon . The king of Aragon ended that daies triumph, and continued chiefe conquerour the next day, and on the fourth day was vnhorsed by Tristramus , and so lost the conquest hee so much desired. Afterwards Tristramus continued that daies triumph with great brauerie, and the fift day was vnhorsed by Annulus , a knight of Libia , who vnhorsed that day fortie knights, to his exceeding honour. The knight of Fame all this while kept himselfe out of sight, and lodged at a village some two myles distant from the Thracian Court, and according to Amasenus appoyntment, came toward the listes gallantly mounted all alone, and by the vnexpected manner of his suddain approach, and by the straunge fashion of his armour, as fortune would, was not generally noted, and in that sort hee entered the listes, reuerencing himselfe towards the scaffold whereon the king was seated, and setting spurres to his horse, incountred Annulus , (and fortune intending at the first to do him some disgrace) mist his course, and Annulus brake his staffe most brauely, wherewith the whole assembly gaue an exceeding shout, and the knight of Fame beeing inraged with his ouersight, charged another course at Annulus with great violence, and ouerthrewe him with his heeles vpward, whereat the whole company gaue an exceeding shout againe, euery one thinking hee had purposely lost his first course, by which meanes all were desirous to see him run againe, which the discontented knight performed so gallantly, that hee vnhorsed another knight of Libia , that thought to reuenge Annulus ouerthrow. Guido disdaining thereat, and seeing how the beholders were affected, noted him more specially, thinking by his foyle to winne some speciall honour, and with the more brauerie to continue the rest of the triumph, and attaine the prize, taking a strong staffe, prepared to meete the knight of Fame , who by that time had dismounted three or foure other knights. The people seeing the valiant Guido come to the listes, who was well knowne to all, thought then surely to see the discontented knights honour at an end, for on him and Drio , the chiefest suppose of conquest depended. Guido incountred the knight of Fame the first time, without offering or sustaining disaduantage, which inwardly vexed him to the heart, that charging him againe the second time, notwithstanding all his force, he could not once mooue him in his saddle. The discontented knight likewise feeling the puissance of his enemie, was exceedingly inraged, that taking another course, they met with such furie, that the earth shooke with the force of their incounter, and their launces shiuered into a thousand peeces, passing by without any shew or signe of oddes. The king of Thrace seeing the day so farre spent, sent a messenger to intreat them to leaue the further triall of their doubtfull conquest vntill the next day, which they both consented vnto. The next morning these two Champions came againe, with desirous mindes to bee reuenged each of the other, and met two courses with such brauerie, that the people with great shouts applauded their chiualrie, the knight of Fame chusing the strongest staffe that he could finde, ment now or neuer to giue or take the foyle, and rushing forcibly to incounter Guido , he met him so violently, that Guidos horse yeelded to the force of their incounter, and falling downe burst his leg: the people seeing Guido downe, were drawne into a wonderfull amazement what this Knight should be. Phylena likewise was much tormented in minde, in her fancie alloting him the chiefest honour. and seeing he was some knight of a straunge countrie, fearing least he obtaining her by conquest, should carrie her farre from her fathers Court, and so quite from the sight and company of her deare friend Remulus , that she was drawen into such a sadde conceit, that her heart seemed to melt thereat. Trudamor seeing Guido so foyled, with great brauerie entred the listes, and encountred the Knight of Fame , who likewise charged him with many braue courses, that in the ende, the conquest remained in great doubt betwixt them, still continuing their encounters with exceeding courage, that Trudamor with all his strength could not any whit disaduantage the Knight of Fame , nor he by his force get any oddes of Trudamor : that in the end, Trudamor thirsting for the honour of the title, and longing to enioy Phylena for his Bride, tracing softly to his races ende, went towards the knight of Fame , who with the like behauiour met him, to whom Trudamor sayd as followeth. Knight, I see we haue no aduantage against each other by this exercise, let vs then finish the doubtfulnesse of this strife with our swords, which is the readiest meane to make one of vs conquerours. With all my heart (answered he againe) your proffer so well agreeth to my fancie, as I neither can nor will deny the same: wherewith they drew their swords, and charged each other with furious blowes, whose courage each beholder greatly commended. The king of Thrace beholding the noble valour of the Knight of Fame , was exceedingly well affected towards him: in so much, that he desired none might enioy his daughter but hee: betweene whom and Trudamor continued a most braue combat, till in the end, the knight of Fame had so grieuously wounded him, and in so many places, that all the beholders accounted Trudamor as halfe vanquished: and what with effusion of blood, and ouermaistred by the knight of Fames strength, his armour giuing way to euery blowe, was readie to fall from his horse: which the Knight of Fame perceiuing stayed: vttering these words. Most noble knight (quoth he) I see the daunger you are in, therefore I wish you to yeeld your selfe, for it is not your death that I seeke: and rather then I will be guiltie thereof, I will yeeld vp the pray I shall winne by your conquest. Trudamor hearing his speeches, exceedingly admired his courtesie, and being readie to speake, his sences by weaknesse beganne to fayle, and he was taken from his horse to haue his gaping wounds stenched. The whole multitude of beholders noting the singular valour of the knight of Fame , and how courteously he had abstained from killing Trudamor , whose life was in his power, were so wel affected towards him, that they shouted and reioyced exceedingly at his victorie. The king seeing the day growne to an end, came from the scaffolde, and with great intreaties got the knight of Fame to go with him to the Court, where hee was most honourably entertained, and had his wounds carefully searcht by the Phisitians, who found none of them daungerous. Amasenus seeing the knight of Fame had won the chiefest honour of the triumph for that day, came to the king, and reported to him how long he had beene with him, and the manner of his first arriuall in that countrie, seeking to increase the kings affection towardes him, by entring into many exceeding commendations of his valor, vertue, and courtesie: that the king did him all the honour that might bee for that night, intending after the triumph ended, to expresse his loue toward him by all meanes he could deuise. Early the next morning, being the last day of the triumph, the king was sommoned to the fielde, by the shrill sounde of the knight of Fames trumpet, who was gallantly mounted, attended by an infinit number of people, that came to glut their eyes with beholding him: there was now no talke but of the knight of Fame , his fame had fedde the eares of all, in so much, that such a number of people thronged to see the last daies triumph, that the place could not containe their multitude. The knights of Thrace maruelled what hee should be, and for that he was vnknowne, the straunge knights somewhat reioyced, that the prize should be carried from Thrace . Amongst the rest, Remulus noting his exceeding courtesie, and prying more narrowly then any of the rest, into his behauiour, reioyced in his mind, that so honorable, valiant, and courteous a knight, should possesse his deare Phylena , and aboue all the knights of the Court, he was most readie to entertaine the knight of Fame with all courtesie, and wisht that none but he might beare away the chiefest honour of the triumph. The king hauing againe in most sumptuous and royall sort, seated his daughter vpon the scaffold, attended the first encounter that should be giuen to the knight of Fame , which was performed by Parrus , & knight of Cicill , with great brauerie, but the second course hee measured his length on the earth, as others had done before him. Next him came a knight of Libia , who had like fortune to Parrus: Guido being not satisfied with desire of victorie, but in putting the cause of his lost ouerthrow to his horse, not himselfe, changed his armour, and came into the listes againe, intending to reuenge his foyle: but before he came, Drio of Cicill had broken two staues with the knight of Fame , and before he could take the third course, Guido instigated by rage, ranne against the knight of Fame , and intercepted him. Drio disdaining thereat, strooke Guido such a forcibly blowe on the head, with the trunchion of a staffe, that he made him stagger. Wherewith Guido drewe his sword, and assayled Drio with great furie, betweene whom began a most braue combat, vntill the knight of Fame stept betwixt them, and parted them, vttering these speeches. Knights (quoth he) what meaneth this outrage? why contend you betwixt your selues, and leaue me, with whom you should principally deale, vnassayed? thinke you I am not of sufficiencie to deale with you both? but that you must thus dishonourably, seeke with priuate quarrels to disturbe our triall? But notwithstanding his speeches, they began to assayle each other againe, which so inraged him, that drawing his sword, he first strooke at Guido , and then at Drio , offering to combat with them both, that the issue of this combat seemed to be most intricate. Sometimes the knight of Fame assayled Guido , and he resisting, when Drio lent his blowes to both: and the knight of Fame intending to reuenge him on Drio , was againe assayled by Guido . The k. perceuing what danger this tripartite fight might breed, commanded the Champions to be parted, which beeing done, the Iudges gaue order, that the knight of Fame should continue his course with Drio . This conclusion being made, the knight of Fame sheathing his sword, went to the races end so fully incenst with rage, that his eyes smarted with vexation. Drio likewise was so fully puft with fury, that hee vowed at that course to ende the triall of the combat: that both of them taking scope ynough, to meete with the greater swiftnesse, set spurs to their steeds sides, and with exceeding violence, and shiuering their launces into a thousand spels, which sung in the ayre: before the steeds met, Drio winding his raines, intending to ouerthrow his enemie vnawares, the steed vnacquainted to such custome, bare his head aloft, and the knight of Fames steede keeping on his continued course, with great strength ouerturned both horse and man, that Drio lay almost brused to death with the waight of his horse. Guido attending the next triall, had readily couched his staffe, but the knight of Fame being extreamly inraged, not well knowing, nor caring what he did hauing secret intelligence before giuen him, that it was Guido , the knight that he had alreadie vanquished, set spurs to his horse, and ran at him with his sword poynt, that had he not auoyded him, he had pearsed the same quite through his bodie: who turning himselfe with his sword drawn, assayled the knight of Fame , betweene whom continued a most braue combat a long space, vntill Guido by his vnresistable blowes, was greeuously wounded: who intending to reuenge himselfe, strooke a most violent blowe, which lighting crosse his helmet, brake his sword: which the knight of Fame seeing, cast down his owne, disdaining to haue any oddes of weapon, and ioyning himselfe close to Guido , with long striuing and maine force, in the end slung him down from his horse: wherwith the people gaue such a shout, that the earth seemed to shake with the Eccho of their voyces: by which time, the nights blacke mantel began to ouerspred the whole earth, and there appeared no more combattants against the knight of Fame , but to his vnspeakable honor he remained victor. Then presently he was in triumphant manner (according to their custome) with the noyse of trumpets conducted to the kings Pallace: where the king and all the vanquished Knights receiued him with great honour. Amongst the rest, was the King of Aragon , a most gallant and braue Knight at armes, who greatly desired to be acquainted with this braue Champion, vsing him, with the rest of the knights, with all courtesie and kindnesse. After many solemne welcomes were past on euery side, and hee vnarmed, the king speaking to him, vttered these speeches. Most noble knight, whose prowesse hath deserued euerlasting commendatiens, according to my former decree, and the promise reward to the conquerour, I yeeld to your hands my daughter, the onely heire of my kingdome. Then taking Phylena by the hand, he deliuered her to him. The knight of Fame with great reuerence kissing her hand, vttered these speeches. Most sacred Princesse, how can I sufficiently reioyce, that am this day extolled to the highest type of heauenly felicitie, by beeing vnworthily preferred to haue your custodie. Yet I beseech you vouchsafe me though a stranger) that bounty, as to esteem of me, as one that is altogether vowed to your seruice, & thogh by right of conquest I may iustly challenge you for my own, yet be you assured, I will request nothing at your handes, but what shal be granted with your free consent; but I rest yours to command dispose of in all humble dutie. Which words being ended, (he that neuer before kist Ladies lippes) with great reuerence tooke of her a sweete kisse: and she with a heauie heart and milde behauiour, yeelding her selfe as his to dispose of, which she was constrained to do by her fathers promise, and the knights worthie deserts: though inwardly in her heart shee deuoted all kinde loue and affection to Remulus : on whom being by, shee cast many a milde and modest looke, inwardly wishing he were the man might claime her by right of conquest, as well as by the true affection shee bare him. That night the knight of Fame was honourably feasted by the king, and afterwards conducted to a most Princely lodging. And beeing now alone, he began to meditate of his estate, and to ponder how happily he had escaped shipwracke, and was preferred to such high dignitie, as to marry the daughter and onely heire of a king: withall, he beganne to call to minde euery particular thing hee could remember of his birth and bringing vp in the Iland of Rockes , his fancie perswading him, that he was sonne vnto some greater personage then he yet knew of: withall, well viewing a iewell which he had kept euer since his nurse was slaine, which she gaue him in charge to keepe charily, which thoughts, and withall, a secret instinct of nature, which hee felt in himself ayming at higher matters, setled a perswasio in his thoghts, that he was borne of royall race, and therefore meete to match with a kings daughter. And calling to minde the exceeding beautie of Phylena , importing in his fancie a perfect remembrance of her graces, sweet countenance and milde behauiour, hee felt a secret stirring and throbbing at his heart, which disturbed all his sences, that he was as it were transformed into a kinde of pleasant delight, wherewith hee fell into a dead sleepe. In middest of his sleepe the Goddesse Venus pittying the troubled thoughts of her deuoted subiect Phylena , willing to extoll the fame of this knight, appeared vnto him in a vision, standing by his beds side, with a cleare burning taper in his one hand, and holding a most beautifull Ladie in the other, of such diuine perfections, that heauen nor earth could not in his fancie frame a more diuine essence of puritie: the Ladie Venus vttering these words. Thou Knight of Fame, Regard the words I speake: Seeke not by force, Loues constant bands to breake, Phylena faire, The bewteous heire of Thrace : Her constant Loue, On Remulus doth place. Desire not then, Her liking to attaine, But from her loue, Thy fantasie refraine. Thy conquest right, Giue him that hath her loue: And from their hearts, The cares they bide, remoue. This Lady bright, thy fansies shall subdue, Then to her loue, be constant iust and true. First seeke her out, then to her pleasure tend: To win her loue, thy whole affection bend. Of Royoll rare, thy selfe art rightly sproong. Lost by thy friends, when thou of art were yoong. Thy fathers fame, hath fild the world with praise. Thy mothers gifts, her lasting honors raise. Bend thy desires, Their comfort to procure, That for thy losse, Sad sorrowes do procure. Whilest the Goddesse vttered these words, the Knight of Fame diligently beheld the exceeding bewtie of the Lady she held in her hand, and thinking to haue demaunded her name, shee presently vanisht: wherewith he awaked. The remembrance of this Uision, draue him into a confused multitude of thoughts: one while perswading himselfe, it was but a dreame and not to be regarded, and then againe assuring himselfe it was a Uision, like to that which appeared to him in the Iland of Rocks, but chiefly such a secret impression of the Ladies bewtie was fired in his remembrance, that he quite forsooke and forgot the least thought to Phylena , whose bewtie in his fancie, was nothing comparable to her diuine perfections, that calling to minde euerie particular note hee had seene, the perfect Idea of the Ladies countenance, fauour and bewtie, was so deepely imprinted in his heart, that no other thought could sinke in his braine, but that she was the Lady he should honour, that he vowed to search the world throughout to finde her, and come to the knowledge of his parents. In these cogitations he spent the rest of that night. Earlie in the morning, he was honored with all diuersities of curtesies, and most royally feasted of the King, and by his appointment, should be affianced to Phylena , within six daies. The knight of Fame remembring the Uision, being most commonly in company of Phylena , diligently noted, which might be the knight Phylena loued, and soone perceiued that it was Remulus , who amongst the knights of Thrace , had sought most meanes to honour him. Who little thought the knight of Fame hadde noted the kindnesse betwixt him and Phylena : but he noting all circumstances, perceiued that Phylena was deepely inthralled in the bands of constant loue: for though shee were in talke with him, yet her eye was continually on Remulus , glaunsing so many sweete lookes intermingled with sighes) towards him, that he thought it a most discurteous and inhumane deede to parte them. And once taking occasion when Phylena was in a deepe studie, he said, Deare Lady, may I bee so bolde as breake off your old studie, wherewith you adde heauinesse to your minde: and expell this carefull disposition, and rather spend your time in mirth and pleasure, I haue often noted your heauinesse, which maketh me suppose my vnworthinesse to bee the causer thereof: but seeing my interest is such, as that I may clayme you for my owne, I beseech you do not so much disgrace my trauailes, as not to vouchsafe me that kindnesse belongeth to the condition of my conquest, and your fathers decree: and if you esteeme mee, because vnknowne, as yet not to haue deserued your loue, impose me any taske, and I will vndertake it for your sake: and not onely labour to winne your loue by desert, as by the tryumphe I haue attained the interest of your person. But I perceiue your cares are such, for some other great occasion, that I am an vnwelcome guest to your company, and an other hath alreadie attained your sweete loue: which if it be so, sweete Lady hide not the same from mee, but make me priuie thereto, for I am not of that rude disposition, to challenge any thing at your hands, or inforce you to any thing, but what shall stand with your liking: and though your vertues force you to yeelde consent to your fathers decree, yet considering that loue is not wonne with the swoorde, but with a mutuall consent of the heart, I yeelde my selfe to bee censured by you, and giue my right of tryall into your hands, and the interest I attained by conquest, I surrender to your censure, to be reuoked or established. Phylena hearing his woords, with teares standing in her eyes, made this reply: Most curteous Knight, how soeuer I haue setled my fancie heretofore, that is nowe countermaunded by my fathers promise, and your interest, that I am not mine owne to dispose of, but must in all humblenesse rest at your disposition. And if an other had my promise of loue, yet nowe I must reuoke that promise, and labour to attend your liking: therefore I wholely commit my selfe according to your right of conquest, into your curteous hands. Deare Lady (quoth he) know this, that I account my selfe vnworthy of that honour, and am vnwilling any way to contradict your will, or disturbe your quiet: but knowing that which you vertuously conceale, will surrender my estate to the Knight you most fancie: for the honour I haue wonne, shall be my sufficient reward: therefore I beseech you, conceale no part of your minde from me, for I will not denie to performe any thing you shall command, but will hazard both life and honour to satisfie your fancie, and any way procure your content. Phylena with a blushing countenance, made this short replie: Most noble Knight, Remulus is the knight I haue long esteemed, but must now forsake him, or purchase my parents discontent, and denie you the right of your conquest. The knight of Fame smiling at the inward conceit of his Uision, made this answere. And deare Lady, I will yeelde my interest to Remulus , onely to worke your content: for he hath worthily deserued to be beloued of you: besides the honour he hath done me (notwithstanding I might be the onely man to hinder his content) sheweth the abudant vertues that rule his heart. He had not scarce ended those woords, but Remulus , seeing his eares to glow, thinking all time tedious out of his La. sight, came into ye gallery, wher they were in priuate conference: but seeing them (half repenting his intrusion) would haue stept backe: towards whom, the Knight of Fame came, leading the Princesse by the hand, and contrary to Remulus expectation, said. Curteous Knight, your interest in this Lady, is greater then mine, for you haue her heart, and I but her hand: which I surrender vnto you, with all the state I can claime in her by right of conquest: and so effectually will I deale with the King, to your liking, that hee shall confirme that to you, which I should possesse by his graunt. Remulus hearing his speeches, was so reuiued with ioy, that he could not tell what answer to make him, and Phylenas heart leapt within her, being most glad fortune had effected that meanes for her, to enioy her deare knight Remulus . The Knight of Fame , hauing his thoughts troubled with the remembrance of his trauels in search of his vnknowne Lady, and willing to leaue them to their secret content, with all curtesie (after many speeches past) departed from them: who tooke such felicitie in the assurance he had giuen them of obtaining the Kings consent, that their ioy was without company, spending their time in sweet and pleasant communication. Afterwards the knight of Fame grew into great familiaritie with Remulus , and the day for the solemnization of the wedding being come, he with Phylena in great pompe, were conducted to the Chappell to be affianced togither, where the Knight of Fame kneeling downe, desired the King to grant him one request: who sware by his Crowne and Kingdome, to grant it him, whatsoeuer it were. Most noble King (quoth he) my humble desire is, that you wold without further doubt, ratifie that which I shall performe in the behalfe of the Princesse. Thou shalt not be denied quoth the King. Then the Knight of Fame rising vp, tooke Phylena by the hand, and gaue her to Remulus : the King being astonished thereat, yet remembring his oath, said. Since by right she is yours, & this being with her liking, I giue her freely to thee Remulus , & withall, adopt thee mine heire, with her after my death. Remulus kneeling, thankt his Maiestie: and presently they were affianced togither, and the rights and solemnities of the wedding performed with admirable pompe, to their ioy, and the high honor of the Knight of Fame . How Archas discouered Soranas deceit, and missing Violetta , slue her. And how Violetta lighted on a Hermits Cel, who conducting her towards Bohemia , died: and of the miseries shee indured afterwards, vntill shee was entertained at Panuamus Castle, neare the Forrest of Arde . by Sorana , whom he supposed to be Violetta , without speaking a word, and hauing somewhile embraced her in his armes, beganne his daliance, whom Sorana so cunningly handled, that (notwithstanding his former familiaritie) he perceiued nothing but that it was Violetta indeed. At the first she made a shew of straungenesse, but afterwards indured whatsoeuer he proffred, with whom hee spent that night, giuing no respite to sleepe, but greedily satisfying both their desires, vntill the morning approaching, Archas according to his mistresse commad, departed, and left his Paramour in his bedde, his fancie perswading him, that shee was the most sweetest Ladie in the world, which so reioyced his heart, that he spent that forenoone in much mirth, but missing Sorana , for that he had not seene her all that day, he went to her chamber, where being entred, he saw some of Violettas attires and ornaments confusedly cast about, and all things in such disorder, that hee could not tell what to thinke, at last he enquired of euery one for her but none could tell what was become of her, vntill comming to the Gardiants, they told him that Sorana went out of the Castle the last night, and that she had left with them his ring. Archas seeing the ring, knowing that he had giuen it to none but Violetta , was so amazed  & astonished with doubt, that he presently suspected Violetta was escapt: and comming to the chamber where she should haue beene, softly drawing the bed curtaines, found that Sorana had beene his bedfellow in steede of Violetta , who after her pastime was fallen a sleepe. Archas now perfectly knew that Violetta was escaped in Soranas disguise, and thought that it could not be, but that she must bee consenting thereto, which caused him to fetch his sword, determining to end her life: but by that time he was returned, she was awake, and seeing him comming towards her, with his sword bent to her death, being terrified therewith, shee gaue such shrikes, as many of the seruaunts hearing the noyse, came running into the chamber, but he being incenst with exceeding rage, for Violettas losse, and inwardly fretting at his deceit, with repentance that he had bestowed his loue on that loathsome creature, who now seemed most vgly, in respect of the diuine and sweete Lady he supposed he had embraced, caught holde on her, and by the haire of the head, dragd her out of the bed into the middest of the chamber, vttering these words. Most detested strumpet, couldst thou not bee contented to consent to Violettas escape, but thou must also betray my loue to thy loathsome lust? was not the fauour I daily shewed thee, sufficient to deter thy mind from offering me that abuse? deceiuing my expectation, betraying my life by her escape? I could peraduenture haue remitted the one, if thou haddest not beene guiltie in both: but neuer shalt thou reioyce in my fall, and little pleasure shalt thou reape by thy nights worke: wherewith, not suffering her to make him answere, assuredly perswading himselfe she was guiltie in both, he thrust his sword quite through her body, and there in that vndecent sort left her, giuing many a grone, with the date of her life. The seruants seeing this, couered her body, and afterwards buried it. Archas presently arming himselfe, giuing speciall charge to the Gardiants to keepe diligent watch, posted that way he thought best in her search. Violetta by this time was wandred a great way, care hastning her steppes, and feare to be againe by him surprised, tooke away the tediousnesse of trauell, at last forsaking the beaten way, she wandred aside into a most desart and vnfrequented place, being so full fraught with trees and litle springes, that there she thought was the safest harbour, wherein to remaine vndescried, being tired with trauel, & possest with care, she sate down vpon a banke side to refresh her selfe. She had not long stayed in that place, but she beheld an aged man, whose yeares made him stoupe to the earthwards, carying a fewe drie stickes vnder his arme. Violetta thinking she might repose some confidence in his vertues because of his yeares, drew towards him: who seeing so beautifull a Ladie in that vnfrequented place vnattended, exceedingly maruelled: so whom she said. Ah good father, whose yeares beare reuerence, will you vouchsafe a distressed Ladie succour, who by extreame miseries compulsion, am wandred to this vnknowne place, sore wearied with trauell, and in requitall of your kindnesse, my prayers shall inuocate the heauens to graunt you felicitie, and my reward sufficient to content you for your paines. The old man hearing her speeches, made this answere: Faire Ladie, my homely Cell is not woorthie to receiue your person, but such as it is, you shall be hartily welcome thereto: for I desire to liue no longer, then to extend my small assistance to such as are in distresse, but especially to such harmelesse creatures as your selfe: therefore pleaseth you with kindnesse to accept what succour my abilitie will afford, or what counsell my experience may giue you, you shall receiue both with a willing heart. And for that I see your trauell, (vpon what occasion to me as yet vnknown) hath both wearied you, and this colde earth whereon you sate, may indanger your health, giue me your hand and I will yeeld you what ayde my weake strength will permit, to guide you to my Cell, which is hard by. Do so good father (quoth she) and I thanke you most hartily, where I will disclose to you my vnfortunate mishap: that said, she lent her selfe vppon his aged arme, so wearied with trauell, that she scarce could set her feete vppon the grassie earth, for hurting them. His Cell it was no other but a hollow caue, which the poore olde man by his owne industrie, had cut and vndermined vnder the side of a rockie hill, which was well contriued, hauing his lodging seuerall from the rest, and so artificially had he framed his Chimnie, that through a hollow vawte hee conueyed the smoke, at the foote wherof, ran a most pleasant spring, where the cleare water striuing with the smooth pebbles, made a burbling noyse, where the comfortable beames of golden Phoebus had full force. On the other side was a sweete spring, where the birds kept continuall pleasant recording harmonie. Assoone as Violetta was entred this old mans Paradice, he seated her soft vpon a chaire, giuing her all the courteous entertainment he could, and presently brought foorth such eates as he was prouided of: which was, white bread, cheese, and apples: her drinke being the cleare brooke water that ran by his Cell doore, whereto, because he would amend the taste to her liking, he mingled Aquauitie. Violetta being hungrie, thoght his poore prouision in that quiet place, daintie fare, wherwith she stenched her hunger, & in the meantime, the old man had heat water and hearbes for to bath her euertrauelled feete in, which shee kindly accepted, perceiuing that it came as willingly from the old mans heart, as euer good deed came from any, & therwith bathed her feet. This done, Violetta desired the old man to seat himself down by her, who taking a stoole, sate downright against her, fixing his eyes vpon her face, whilst she began to speake as followeth. Good father (quoth she) the kindnesse I finde in your entertainment, sheweth the vertues that rule your heart, which maketh me no whit doubt to commit the dangerous report of my tragical misfortune to your secrecie, neither need I require any stricter assurance, then your promise alreadie past, to extend your ayde to my distresse. Therefore thus it is. I was borne in Thessalie , and there wedded to the noble and courteous knight Pollipus , who came lately to Bohemia , with the most noble and famous Prince Parismus , who hath brought hither the kings daughter of Thessalie , the vertuous Princesse Laurana : we had not stayed long in the Bohemian Court in great ioy, but thus our felicitie was crost, my Lord and I one day) intised by the heate of the sunne to seeke some coole shadow, wandred from the Court into a pleasant groue, where haunted a wilde Beare, whom my louing knight espying, pursued, and I fearing least some harme might betide him, compelled by desire of his welfare, thought to haue followed him, but wandred a quite contrarie way, and beeing gotten out of the wood, fearing to returne backe, was by Archas (to mee before vnknowne) by cunning deceit conueyed to his Castle, his promise being to carry mee backe to the Bohemian Court, where when hee had remained some two daies, he certified me falsly (which I afterwards perceiued) that Pollipus was dead, which I beleeuing, tooke so heauily, that I was often in daunger of my life thereby: but in small time I plainly found his falsehood, and vnderstood his intent, which was, to detaine mee in his keeping, to satiate his lust, which grew to such furie, that surprising me vnawares in his Garden, he would haue forced me, had not a Gentlewoman by my cries repaired to the place where I was, and thereby preuented him. Whom I made priuie to all my secrets, by whose meanes, late yesternight I stole from the Castle: now good father (quoth she) counsell me how to escape his hands, who I know maketh all diligent search for me, and vnlesse you helpe me, I am like to fall into his hands againe, which rather then I will do, I will indure a thousand deaths. The old man had all this while diligently noted euery circumstance of her discourse, making this answer: Lady, I perceiue by your speech what miseries you haue vndergone by Archas treacherie, whose infamous deeds hath made his name famous, being the chiefe Gouernour of these mountaines: indeede extreamly and generally hated, who delighteth in no vertuous action, but continually addicts his minde to villanie, and vnknightly deedes, out of whose hands, you are most happie to haue escaped: neither are you in the countrey of Bohemia (as you suppose) but far distant from thence: and the best meanes for you to get thither, is to change your habit, whither my selfe so pleaseth you, will be your weake, yet trustie guide. Violettaes heart leapt within her, for ioy to heare his speeches, which she presently put in practise, giuing him a Iewell: which he at the next towne exchanged for such homely weedes as they deuised to bee fittest to shrowde her from being discried. Wherewith hauing apparelled her selfe, she departed with the olde man, who left his Cell to the keeping of his sonne, who was seruant to a wealthie Boore dwelling thereby. The first dayes iourney they ouerpast with ease, shortning the tediousnesse of the way, with the olde mans discourses: and at night rested themselues as conueniently as they might, vpon the colde earth, and in this sort they iournied on some three dayes, vntill their prouision began to decay: and they were without hope of getting any more to supply their want, for that they were entered into a desolate Wildernesse: which they could not ouerpasse in three or foure of their short dayes iournies. Violetta of the twaine, was the best traueller: for the olde man by reason of his withered age, was soone tyred, hauing no such inward conceit to driue him forwards, as she had procured by a longing desire to see her deare knight Pollipus , that she wisht a thousand times that her guide had beene young, and of better strength to indure their iourney. But thus contrary, it fell out the olde mans time of death then approched, who hauing taken a surfet, with lying on the colde earth, began to be sickly: and in the ende so weake, that he could indure no further trauell: but sitting downe vpon a banke side, feeling an extreame faintnesse possesse his heart, he vttered these speeches: Unfortunate wretch that I am, that am not able to performe my promise made to you most curteous Lady: but must here leaue you in distresse, and without comfort: would that my desteny had not suffered me to liue vntill this instant: or that your good fortune had bin so fauorable to haue lighted vpon a safer guide, that you might haue escaped the desolation, I am most vnhappily like to leaue you in: this vnfrequented wildernesse, affoordeth no release to your cares: but after my death, your trauells are to begin afresh, being without a guide, which may chance to bring your vertuous perfections into some further danger: onely this comfort remaineth to my carefull dying heart, that your habit may be a meane to bring you safe from all dangers. This vnfrequented place is so full of vncertaine waies, that I know not almost which of them to counsaile you to follow: onely this: keep the Sunne at his setting, right before you: for that way lyeth the Bohemian Court, and so sweete Lady, I commit you to all good fortune: for I see the date of my wretched life, is at an ende, wishing all prosperous successe to your iourney, all happie escape out of daunger, and your owne sweete hearts content: desiring you to make no tarriance to prouide my Funeralles, but leaue me in this place: for little account do I make of my aged bodie. And so againe, I wish you all happie felicitie, with a blessed and ioyfull ende of your cares: which words being ended, he gaue vp the ghost. Violetta seeing the good olde man dead, was ouercome with such infinit multitudes of cares, that shee had much adoo to keepe her selfe from following him, that she sate there sheading abundance of teares, and what with the remembrance of the desolatenesse of the place, & the dead bodie of the olde man, which was a fearefull coarse to looke vpon: her sences were drawne into such amazed terror, that shee was halfe beside her selfe therewith: and beeing ghasted with the sight of the olde man, hasted with all the speede she coulde, onwards her iourney, but darke night approaching, her minde was then rackt with such confused feare, that sometimes shee thought the olde mans Ghoast haunted her, which appaled her sences with deadlie ghastfull terror: then she thought she heard some wilde beast behinde her, readie to seize vppon her, which made her forsake the place where shee hadde shrowded her selfe, and seeke an other in her fancie more safe: and in a multitude of these cares, shee ouerpast that tedious night, vttering many a sigh for the mornings chearfull approach: which beeing come, shee againe betooke her selfe to her sollitarie trauell, inwardlie sorrowfull for her late misfortune: but most of all terrified with feare to meete Archas , thinking to bend her steppes towards Bohemia . But Fortune intending to augment her cares, and lengthen her trauailes, caused her to wander a quite contrarie way, and shee nothing misdoubting, but supposing shee was in the best way, kept on her steps some three dayes without intermission, and at last espied an auncient Castle, whose craggie walles were readie to fall to the earth, by reason of age, where she was constrained by reason of extreame hunger, to seeke for succour: and comming to the gate, she saw an aged old man with a sad countenance, keeping the entrance: to whom Violetta spake in this sort. Good aged sir, vouchsafe a poore distressed woman some releefe, being wandred far out of my way, and for want of foode, am like to perish. He lifting vp his head, made this aunswere: this place affoordeth small comfort, because euery part thereof, is replete with sorrow: but come in, and what entertainment it yeeldeth, you shall be welcome vnto: that said, he shut the gate, and brought her into the Castle, where were a fewe seruants in mourning attire: seeming by their habit and sad countenances, to be quite ouergrowne with discontent: and in a roome seuerall by it selfe, sate a bewtifull Damzel, with her eyes swolen with griefe: to whom the porter brought Violetta , and said. Madame Clarina , this distressed woman craueth some succour, being wandred far from her way, whom I will leaue with you, because I must returne to my charge. Clarina rising vp, tooke Violetta by the hand, and desired her to sit downe by her, to whom she said. This place by reason of our misfortune, may rather adde care to augment your sorrows, then comfort your distresse: for the miserie that hath lately befallen vs, is such, as hath expeld all ioy from our hearts. And because you shall be acquainted with the truth of all, I will relate the circumstance of our tragedie. There remaineth a Gyant not far from this place, called Brandamor , in a castle of such inuincible strength, as it is impossible to be vanquished by Legions of souldiers, who taketh delight in nothing but cruelty, and vnlawfull attempts. Who vppon a time, chanced to arriue at this Castle, and by euill fortune, espied me walking abroad, in company of my parents, my brother Panuamus , and two of my fathers seruants. And (I know not by what desire thereto drawne, his minde being apt to any mischeefe) he viewing me, liked my beautie, & such a disordinate desire stirred in his brest to obtaine the same, that he shrowded himselfe in secret, vntill he espied his fittest oportunitie, and suddenly set vppon my father, offering to take me away by violence: my father denying him, vntill the Gyant beeing inraged, drew his sworde and assailed him, whom in short time he slew: which my mother and I perceiuing, fled towards this Castle, and in the meane time my brother Panuamus continued fight against him a good space, but beeing vnable to cope with so mighty an enemie, was by reason of many greeuous wounds, in the ende left by him for dead: which done, Brandamor seeing our flight, hasted after vs: but before he could come at vs, we attained the Castle, and rescued our selues from his possession: But when he saw himselfe disappointed, he made as though he had departed from hence, and contrarie to our thoughts, he hid himselfe secretly amongst the bushes. My mother being ouercome with extreame sorrow for my fathers death, neither regarding doubt, nor daunger, went back with hope to recouer him, whom Brandamor surpressed and carried aaway with him, hoping by her imprisonment, to win her consent to yeeld me into his hands. My brother Panuamus , within a while, recouered his feet, not knowing of my mothers misfortune, with great danger of his life, crawled home; whom I had much adoo to preserue from death, and now he is departed towards the Forrest of Arde , where the giants castle standeth, to inuent means to set my mother at libertie: and this night is the promised time of his returne. And thus haue you heard the whole circumstance of our sorrow: which when she had said, aabundance of teares issued from her eyes: which made Violetta (whose tender heart was readie to relent at euery sad discourse) accompanie her lamentations with watrie eyes: withall, remembring how vnfortunately she was still crost in her desires, which was to attaine to Bohemia and how contrary to her expectation, she was wandred quite an other way, and brought both in danger of her life, and to that poore and distressed estate, her heart was prest with such inward sorrow, that she could not stay the passage of her teares already begun: but such a violent floud distilled from her precious eye-balles, that Clariana could not chuse but note them, and withall, grew into an earnest desire to know the cause of that extraordinarie passion: withall, wel viewing her beautie and sweete countenance: collecting into her fancie euerie circumstance, shee beganne to suppose that Violetta was no such as her apparell shewed, but of better byrthe and bringing vppe, then by her attire was shewen, that desiring to bee resolued of those doubts which rose in her fancie, she vttered these speeches. I know not quoth shee, what title to ascribe vnto you, for that I am ignorant of whence and what you are, but if you will commit the report therof to me, I promise you both to coceale the same (if any such neede be) and also to do my vttermost to pleasure you any way. Therefore I desire you to impart the recital thereof to my secrecie, that knowing your estate, I may know how to vse you according to your worthinesse. Violetta being desirous to seeke any meanes for to comfort her selfe, made this reply. I most hartily thank you for offring me so large a proffer of your assistance, which I stad in need of now, for that my endlesse trauel craue some ease: for my lucklesse stars haue alotted me such aduersities, as would soone cut off the wretched liues of many: but neither death, nor ought else will be so fauourably as to ridde me from further calamities, but I am still plunged into their intricate laborinth: for know most courteous Ladie, that my selfe of late was promoted to all felicitie, but now am contrarily plunged in all distresse, and that this habit I haue onely put on, to shrowd my selfe from many perils, that I was formerly subiect vnto. For I am an vnfortunate Ladie as you are, by extreame misfortune drawne from my dignitie, friendes and acquaintance, and forced both by want and wearinesse to seeke refuge in this place, where by your kindnesse I am well refresht: neither will I conceale any of my misfortunes from your knowledge. Then Violetta repeated the whole trueth, as she had done before to the olde man in his Cell, which when Clarina heard, with teares shee did pertake her sorrow: and taking her by the hand, desired her to hold her excused, for not vsing that behauiour towards her, which her estate deserued, promising with willingnesse, to further her safe conduct into Bohemia , which she knew her brother Panuamus at her intreatie would vndertake. In this and such like communication they spent their sad time, vntil Panuamus returne, who shortly came without hope of redeeming the Ladie Madera his mother. Clarina assoone as he was come, declared to him all that she could of Violettas estate, and what she was: amongst the rest, she tolde him that she was espoused to a Knight named Pollipus. Panuamus hearing her name Pollipus , called to remembrance the speeches hee had with a Knight that he met that day, and assuredly thought this was the Ladie he went in search of. Now the Knight he had met was Tellamor , who entring into communication with him, inquired if he could tell any newes of a Lady that was vnfortunately lost in Bohemia (relating the very same circumstance that Clarina told him, Violetta had before declared vnto her) withall, Tellamor demaunded if he had not met a Knight, bearing this deuise in his shield: A Knight pursuing a Beare . Now it fell so out, that Panuamus beheld the notable combat that Pollipus fought with Brandamor , and remembring his deuise, knew him to be the same knight Tellamor inquired after, to whom he declared all that hee knewe, concerning the battell with Brandamor , and how treacherously he was surprised and imprisoned. Tellamor hearing that Pollipus was imprisoned in the Forrest of Arde , departed thitherwardes, and Panuamus came to his Castle, where at his comming, he found Violetta in simple array, and hearing his sisters speeches, waying each circumstance, found that she was the very Ladie that the Knight inquired after, and that the knight that fought so valiantly with Brandamor , and was by him imprisoned, was her husband. Panuamus hauing gathered this intelligence of Violettas misfortunes, and remembring the noble valour of Pollipus , was touched with an affectionate pittie of her distresse, and what furthered by his owne inclination and Clarinas intreatie, resolued to vse his vttermost indeuours to worke her comfort: and coming to Violetta , declared the whole circumstance of all that he had heard of Tellamor , and of Pollipus , in the Castle of Brandamor . Violetta hearing of a certaintie that Pollipus was yet liuing, and not dead, as she before that suspected, (for though she perceiued the contrary before in Archas Castle, yet a scruple remaining in her minde thereof) was somewhat comforted, and in some better hope to come to him againe: but calling to minde the daunger hee was now in, was exceedingly againe ouerwhelmed with care of his welfare: and hearing of his imprisonment, determined to indaunger her owne libertie to enioy his company, if other meanes could not be wrought for his release. Panuamus seeing her ouerwhelmed with such a chaos of cofused cares, said as followeth. Most vertuous Ladie, since Fortune hath brought you into this place, & that you haue thus happily heard of your knight Pollipus , release your selfe from the bonds of those cares, which disturbe your quiet: for here you shall want nothing that accordeth to your will: and my selfe will do the best I can to set Pollipus at libertie, which whilest I go about, so pleaseth you, my sister Clarina shall keepe you company, whose greefes are as geat as may be. Sir (quoth Violetta ) might I obtaine this fauour at your handes, that you would giue the knight you met, knowledge of my beeing here, then I am sure he will soone come to me, with whom I would gladly speake, for I know he is one of the knights of Bohemia . That will I do (quoth Panuamus ) or any thing else you shall commaund me: and because I will not be disappoynted of meeting him, I wil early in the morning follow him, for that he is gon to the Forrest of Arde , where I shall be sure to finde him. Early the next morning, according to his word, he mounted himselfe, and departed after Tellamor , leauing Clarina and Violetta togither, vsing the best perswasions they could to comfort one another. How Panuamus met with Tellamor , and how hee and Tellamor met Barzillus at the Golden Tower: and returning altogither to Panuamus Castle, Tellamor was enamoured of Clarina . to finde Tellamor , and riding an vnwoonted pace, hee ouertooke him entring into the Forrest, vnto whom hee said. Sir Knight, let me bee so bold as to aske you one question? Tellamor hearing his words, and knowing him to be the same knight he had met withall before, courteously had him aske what he pleased. Are you not a knight of Bohemia (quoth he?) Tellamor maruelling why he askt him that question, tolde him that he was indeede belonging to Parismus Prince of Rohemia . The said Panuamus , a Ladie that remaineth not far hence, named Violetta , hath sent me backe vnto you, and desireth to speake with you. Tellamor hearing his words, was affected with exceeding ioy thereat, making this reply. Sir knight, in a happie houre did I meete with you, by your meanes to come to knowledge of their abode I most desire to finde: indeede Violetta is the Ladie I go in search of, and also wife to the knight you tolde me of yesterday, who by your report remaineth prisoner in the Forrest: therefore I will returne with you to visite that Ladie, to whose seruice my life is wholly dedicated. This said, they returned backe togither, but the night beeing approched,  & they without any place to lodge in, thoght it as good to trauel al night, as take vp their lodging on the colde ground: therefore Panuamus vndertooke to guide them, trusting to his owne knowledge, contrary to his expectation, wandred a quite contrary way: and when Phoebus beganne to illuminate the earth with his golden brightnesse, they were come into a pleasant valley, where they beheld two Knights continuing a most fierce combat, and drawing neare vnto them, Tellamor presently knew the one of them to be Barzillus , the occasion of which combat was thus. After Barzillus had parted from Barzillus , and Tellamor taking the middle way, he wandred many daies without any aduenture, and at last arriued at a most goodly Pallace, most exceedingly beautified with innumerable Turrets of exceeding height, that their toppes seemed to equall the clouldes, of such curious workemanshippe, as the like hath not been seen, whose glistring reflection procured by the sunnes bright beames, dazeled the sight of the beholders: with an admirable glittering. In the midst of this stately Pallace, stoode a gallant building in forme of a Temple, seeming to the view of such as beheld the same, to be made of the most purest and burnisht gold. On the toppe whereof, stood the forme of a most goodly Lady, with a Crowne of gold vpon her head, whose liuely proportion & forme of exceeding beautie, would haue detained a most constant mind, in a wandring delight to beholde the same. Barzillus beholding the exceeding beautie of the Pallace, and the stately forme of the pictured Lady, was desirous to know who inhabited there, & to that intent drawing nigh thereto, at the entrance thereof, he beheld a tent, with these verses written theron. Passe not this Bridge before thou knocke, Least thou too late repent thy pride: Leaue not obtained, thou mayst go backe, For entrance is to all denide. A Knight within must know thy name, Thy boldnesse else will turne to shame. Barzillus reading the superscription, smote the Tent with his launce, when presently issued out a knight, in euery poynt readie armed, to whom Barzillus saide as followeth. Knight, I reading the superscription ouer the entrance into the Tent, according to the direction thereof, haue called thee foorth, demanding thy meaning thereby, and what goodly Pallace this is, the like whereof, I neuer beheld for beautie? Knight (aunswered hee againe) this Pallace is called the Golden Tower, belonging to Maximus , the most mightie and famous king of Natolia , wherein is his onely daughter Angelica , for beautie without compare: for wit, forme, and vertuous ornaments, excelling all the Ladies in the world: whose equall was neuer heard of, nor can be found within the spatious continent of the earth. The king hath placed her in this most rich and gorgeous Pallace, whose walles are of Brasse, and framed of such inuincible strength, that no power of man is able to subdue the same: she hath to attend her a hundreth Ladies of great dignitie, and a thousand of the most valiant knights in all the world. The occasion why he guardeth her person is this: At her birth, an olde Inchauntresse prophecied, that her beautie should set kings at discord, and be the cause of her fathers death. A childe is borne, whose beautie bright,, Shall passe each forme of other faire: As doth the sunne in perfect light, Each little starre fixt in the ayre. For whom great Kings shall enter strife, And warre shall shed Natolians blood: Whose Ire shall spill Maximus life, Yet wisdome oft hath harme withstood. A mightie Prine her loue shall gaine, Though vice do seeke to crosse their blisse: He shall her winne with restlesse paine, And she of sorrow shall not misse. Much barbrous blood reuenge shall spill, And all of warre shall haue their fill. All this shall happen by degree, Before this child shall wedded bee. And because he will match her according to her dignitie, hee hath likewise made a vowe, that none but the greatest Potentate in the world shall be her husband. Which said, the knight went into his Tent, and brought out a most gallant picture: this (quoth he) is the Ladies forme, wherein the Artsman hath shewed some pretie skill, but so farre is this picture vncomparable to the perfect description of her celestiall perfections, and as farre different in delicacie, as is blacke from white, or beautie from deformitie, whose view would change the affections of the truest knight liuing, from his former constant resolue, to adore her beautie, and forsake his former vowes, onely to attend her person, for so diuine are her liniaments, and so rare her perfections, that her fame is euen spred throgh all the regions of the world. Barzillus hearing him enter into a new discourse of her beautie, and that in such affectionate sort, hauing before in his fancie said ynough, beganne to laugh at him, saying. Knight; mee thinkst thou dotest, or else art mad, to enter into such commendation of this Ladies beautie, hauing peraduenture neuer seene other faire Ladie, or else for that thy selfe art affectionately deuoted to loue none but her: for I haue seene a Lady that as farre exceedeth this picture, as thou reportest shee doth all other: (which wordes Barzillus spake onely to see whether his valour and boastings were agreeable) wherewith the knight that kept the Tent was so vexed, that he vttered these speeches. What ill nurtured creature art thou (quoth he) that deridest the beautie, that is rather to be admired? haste thou no more maners, then to make so litle estimation of that which all the world adores? thou shalt dearly abide this discourtesie: with that, hee mounted him selfe, and charged a speare at Barzillus , who aunswered him with such courage, that at two courses he ouerthrew him from his horse. By which time a number of Knights were vpon the battlements viewing their combat, and seeing the knight that kept the Tent foyled, burst into an exceeding laughter, and so departed. Barzillus hauing foyled the knight, for that the night drew nigh, withdrew himselfe from the Golden Tower into a pleasant valley, and there stayed that night. The Knight that kept the Tent was belonging to the King of Candie , who came with perswasion to win Angelicas loue with his prowesse, and with much a do had obtained leaue of the Gardiants to keepe the passage, but hee not contented with his foyle, intending to reuenge his disgrace, followed him to the valley, where Tellamor found them combatting, as is aforesaid: who knowing Barzillus , stepping betwixt them, parted the fray. Barzillus likewise knowing Tellamor , with great kindnesse embraced him, and vpon his request declared the cause of their combats. Tellamor then speaking to the knight of the Tent, gaue him this farewell. Knight, returne to your charge, for your combat here is at an ende, for businesse of more importance withdraweth this knight, which may turne to thy good, for likely thou wouldest haue perished by his prowesse. You shall haue occasion ynough to exercise your armes, against such as would steale your Ladie, which this knight intendeth not, therefore returne to your Tent and defend her beautie ther, which none here gainsaieth. Tellamor hauing ended his speeches, intreated Barzillus to depart with him, which the Knight of Candie seeing, hee returned towardes the Golden Tower. By the way as they were returning towards Panuamus Castle, Tellamor declared to Barzillus , how fortunately hee came to knowledge of Violetta , which exceedingly reioyced Barzillus heart, but whe he vnderstood Pollipus misfortune, he was contrarily affected with as great desire to set him at libertie: which communication shortned their iourney, and in the end arriued at the Castle. The newes of their approach soone came to Violettas hearing, who knowing both Tellamor and Barzillus , welcommed their presence with such effusion of teares, that for a space she could not vtter a word, but her floode being somewhat stinted, saluting them most kindly, she vttered these speeches. Your presence woorthie friends, bringeth great comfort to my heart, after my tedious toyle of miserie, what thankes my vndeseruing heart can yeeld, I render you for the paines you haue taken for my sake: for I know you vndertooke this trauell to finde me out, that am not worthie to be so well esteemed of you, much lesse vnable to make you the least part of amends. You may see to what poore estate I am brought by the treacherie of a disloyall knight, who hath caused my misery, your trauell, and Pollipus imprisonment, vntill I was succoured by this courteous Ladie, whose friendshippe hath succoured mee from famishment. This homely attire I vndertooke for my quiet passage, but misfortunes still awayte my miserable steppes, which no disguise can preuent: with that, her teares burst into a flood againe. Barzillus beeing mooued with her teares, was readie to participate her greefe in the maner she did, but at last he said. I beseech you comfort your selfe in these extremities, and let no such passions of sorrow oppresse your heart, since the woorst of your daungers are past: we haue al the reward we expect for our trauelles, now we haue found you, for so much are we bound to that woorthie knight Pollipus , and the most noble and gracious Prince Parismus , (who is likewise trauelled in your search) that we account our liues well imployed to pleasure them and you. Violetta hearing that Parismus was trauelled in her search, was almost ouercome with passionate affection of his kindnesse, and remembring what sorrow Laurana would indure for his absence, with sighes she said. I of all am most vnfortunate, to be the cause of that noble knights trauell, which may many waies hazard his safetie, and breed much disquiet in the Bohemian Court, but especially to that most vertuous, courteous, and honourable Princesse Laurana : whose sorrow I know will bee most exceeding, and all procured by my vnluckie destinie, that am altogither vnwoorthie to bee esteemed of them, nor in any degree to be so highly regarded. Tellamor likewise greeuing to see her sorrow, comforted her in these fewe words: Deare Ladie, cast off these sadde cares, and let no disquiet thought trouble you, for what is past, cannot be recalled, but al is now amended by your recouerie, whose death we all greatly feared. By this time Panuamus had prouided their dinner, which was serued after the best sort: to which, hee and Clarina welcommed them with great kindnesse. Clarinas heart being somewhat comforted by their company, hoping by their meanes to see the downfall of Brandamor , and her mothers release. When they had well refresht themselues, and heard Violetta relate the whole circumstance of her misfortunes, they beganne to deuise what course to take to set Pollipus at libertie: which they found impossible to do by force, because the strength of the place was inuincible: at last, they determined the next morning to trauell thither, to trie if Fortune would any way fauour their attempts. After they had spent some time in these speeches, and euery one fully resolued what to doo, Barzillus sawe a paire of chesse standing on a side Table, which hee went vnto, and beganne to place the men in order, which Panuamus espying, came to him and said: that if he please, he would play a game with him, wherewith Barzillus was contented. Clarina seeing them busie at chesse, tooke Violetta by the hand, and requested her to walke into the Garden: Ladie (quoth Violetta ) so pleaseth you, this knight may beare vs company. Then taking Tellamor with them, they three walkt into the Garden togither, and awhile recreated themselues with seueral discourses of the vertue of the herbs and faire flowers they incountred. And at last beeing wearie with walking, and procured thereto by the heate of the Sunne, they seated themselues togither vnder the shadow of a Mirtle-tree, vpon a rising banke bedeckt with many sweete smelling flowers. Tellamor seeing their sadnesse, entred into many pleasant discourses to expell the same (if he could) out of their mindes, but no speeches he did vse, could once reuiue their cast downe countenances. But Violetta leaning her selfe vpon her elbow, fell fast asleepe, and left Tellamor onely to comfort Clarina , for she heard not what he said: which he perceiuing, left off his talke a while, and in short space after, fell into a deepe studie, from which he suddainely reuiued himselfe (thinking Clarina had noted the same) and casting his eye upon her, he sawe how busie she was cropping the sweete flowers, and collecting diuers of them togither, began to frame a Nosegey. Tellamor seeing her so busie, was vnwilling to interrupt her quiet content, withall, viewing her sweete beautie and prettie gesture, his minde was affected with great pleasure to behold her, and her carelesse nipping the flowers with her white hand, exceedingly gracst her perfections, that his heart inwardly panted with a suddaine motion of delight, and his fancie beganne so much to commend her sweete behauiour, that euen then his affections entertained a secret motion of loue. Whilest he viewed her thus precisely, she suddainly cast her eye vpon him, thinking he had been still in his dumpes, but perceiuing how stedfastly hee beheld her, a suddaine blush attainted her, that therewith the sweet rosiate colour glowed in her cheeks, which he likewise perceiuing, came toward her, and with great reuerence folding her precious hand in his, said. Faire Ladie, I am sorrie my presence hath interrupted your quiet meditation, and hindred your delightfull exercise. Sir (quoth she) your presence hath done no harme, my studie being but ydlenesse, neither was my labour well bestowed, therefore you might the better hinder it. If quoth he) you make so little account thereof, bestowe these flowers on me, and I will become your debtor for them: and your studie I thinke was not as you please to term the same, ydlenesse: for now I see you are fallen into it againe, which maketh me maruell why you should spend your pleasant daies in such cares and sadde cogitations. Sir (quoth Clarina ) how can I do otherwise, when my sorrowes are past compare? Sweete Lady quoth hee) would you followe my aduise, you should mittigate your passions, and banish that care which oppresseth your heart: for things past remedie, are not to be lamented, and impossible to be recouered: but I beseech you pardon my boldnesse, that presume to enter into speech of your thoughts, which may (contrary to my knowledge) be procured by many other occasions: more he would haue said, but Violetta awaking, broke off his talke, that letting go Clarinas sweete hand, which he had held in strict imprisonment, he rose vppe from the rosiate bancke whereon he sate, feeling a suddaine passion ouerwhelme his heart, and turning to a rose bush, cropt off a rose, which he smelt too, and maruelling at that suddaine dumpe, pondring what might be the cause thereof, he felt loues inclinations to take possession of his heart, but suddainely reuiuing himselfe from that dumpe, he turned to them againe, who were risen from their seat, and attended them into the Castle, where Panuamus and Barzillus were, who euen then had ended their pastime, whom afterwards they accompanied till the nights approach broke vp their company. Early the next morning, these knights (resoluing to follow their former purpose) armed themselues, and came downe into the Hall, to take their leaue of Clarina and Violetta. Clarinas heart so melted with greefe, by remembrance of her fathers death, her mothers imprisonment, and the daunger these Knights and her brother might incur, that withdrawing her selfe to a window, she bedewed her Christall cheekes with Christall teares: which Tellamor perceiuing, hauing his deuotions vowed to her seruice, and hauing but lately entertained loue, pittying her laments, and desirous to shew his affection to her wardes, whilest Barzillus and Panuamus were in conference with Violetta ) he came to her and said. Most vertuous Lady, your sadde laments affect my heart with greefe, neither can I chuse but partake your woe, therefore I beseech you, tell me what is the thing you most desire, and which may adde any comfort to your heart, and I will venture both my life and libertie, to purchase the same to your content? Courteous knight (quoth Clarina ) no other cause of care troubleth me, but my fathers death, my mothers imprisonment, and the daunger my brother and you are like to incur, by the treachery of that Gyant Brandamor : for your proffered friendship I yeeld you thankes, being all the reward I am able to make you, wishing you not to hazard yourselfe for my sake, that am vnworthie of such kindnesse, and vnable to make requitall for the same. Yes Lady (quoth Tellamor ) vouchsafe but to inshrine my willingnesse in your remembrance, and giue me any commaund, and but accept me for your preseruatiue: and that is the onely reward I craue, and you shall see that I will in all dutie indeuour to become more gracious in your sight, for my heart desireth nothing more, then to imploy itselfe in your seruice. Clarina hearing his speeches, could not chuse but take them kindly, and marking with what affectionate deuotion they came from him, made this answere. Good Sir, to withhold that small fauour you demaund, were discourtesie, therefore because you proffer your friendship so kindly, I giue you leaue to assume that name vpon you, which is far vnmeet to your dignitie, and if heereafter you performe your words, you shall finde me nothing vnmindfull to reward you: which words being ended, Tellamor with reuerence, parted with a sweet kisse from her corrall coloured lippes. How Tellamor, Barzillus , and Panuamus , set the Ladie Madera at libertie from Brandamors Castle. How they met with Parismus , How the knight of Fame arriued there, and preserued Parismus life, and ouercame the Gyant. After many cerimonious farwels past, they parted, the Ladies to their chaber, & the knights to their iourney towards Brandamors Castle, where at sunne set they arriued, and for that night tooke vp their Inne vnder the couert of a spreading Oake, deuising amongst themselues, by what meanes they might atchiue their desire. Early the next morning Argalt issued foorth of the Castle, intending as his custome was, to search if any knights were in the Forrest, (for euer since Venolas imprisonment, diuers knights of Libia came to trie their fortune against Brandamor ) whom these three knights supposed to haue beene the Gyant himselfe. And Tellamor being the forwardest, went toward him, whom Argalt thus greeted. Knight, of whence art thou? or wherefore commest thou on to this forbidden ground? Gyant, (quoth Tellamor ) I come to defie thee that vsurpest such priuiledge to examine passengers, and my intent is, in despight of thee, to keepe my standing on this ground, which is free for all men. What is thy quarrell (quoth Argalte ?) I come (quoth hee) to redeeme a knight, whom contrary to equitie thou detainest: and a Ladie, whose Lord thou lately slewest, that dwelt in a Castle hereby. Argalte hearing his speeches, burst into a laughter, saying. Thinkest thou poore knight, to do more then many thy betters could accomplish: no, knowe that thou art so farre from attaining the least of thy desires, that thy selfe art like to beare them company: wherewith Tellamor ranne at him, and in the incounter burst his speare, when the Gyant valiantly resisted. Panuamus and Barzillus regarding to performe no respect of knightly chiualrie, to him that was without regard of humanitie, presently both at once with Tellamor assailed him, and within little space had brought him within mercie of their swords. When Argalt saw himselfe so shrowdly handled, and his life in that danger, he vttered these speeches. Ualiant knights spare my life, that neuer yet offended you: and let me vnderstand wherein I haue done you wrong, and I will doo my best to make you restitution. Tyrant (quoth Panuamus ) hadst thou a thousand liues, all of them could not make vs restitution for any of the least iniuries thou haste done vs but now thou seest thy selfe in daunger, thou treatest for pittie, when otherwise thou intendest nothing but villanie: thinkest thou our minds are so easily drawn to vse mercie: towards thee, that hast fild the world with thy tyrannies, and yeeldest no fauour to any that come within thy power? No, know wicked homicide, that this is the last houre thou shalt breath, wherewith hee aduanced his sword to haue thrust it through him. Argalt fearing his resolution, cried vnto him to heare him speake, and said as followeth. Woorthie knights (quoth hee) before you finish my daies know whom you put to death: I am not Brandamor , whom you suppose me to be, but his brother, my name Argalt , that neuer in my life offended you: therefore I beseech you spare my life, and whatsoeuer you impose vpon me, I will performe to my vttermost power. Barzillus hearing his speeches, tolde Panuamus that hee might bee a meanes to saue their further trauell, if he wold set the Ladie Madera & Pollipus at libertie: therefore he thus said. Argalt , we know not how to trust a man of thy nature and disposition, which thinkest euery disloyall action lawfull to further thy drifts, and regardest neither vertue nor knighthood, but onely thine owne will: therefore if we should inioyne thee to any thing, thou wouldest disloyally breake thy oath, and soone forget what thou vowedst to vs to performe: and contrary to honestie, rather betray vs to thy treacherie: but if thou wilt saue thy life, assure vs to set at libertie the Lady Madera , and the woorthie Knight Pollipus , and on that condition we will let thee go free. Argalt beeing glad of his speeches, vowed and protested with infinit protestations, to fulfill their requests within two daies, vppon which condition they let him depart. Argalt being gone, began to consider what promise hee had made them, and by what meanes he had escaped death, and how courteously vpon his oathes they had saued his life, and gaue credence to his speeches, which with intended resolution he purposed to accomplish, and beeing entred the Castle, comming to Brandamor (wounded & faint, with bleeding he declared to him all that had happened) requesting his consent to accomplish their demaund, which he had bound himselfe by oath to performe. Brandamor hearing his words, fel into a bitter rage against him, and vttered these speeches. Why brother (quoth hee) consider you not what great daunger might ensue, if I should accomplish your request? and withall, do you not remember the valour that is in this knight Pollipus , which might by his libertie bring vs all in daunger? As for the Ladie Madera , I regard not if I send her hence, for now I esteem not her daughters beautie, which was the cause I haue so long time detained her: then if you please, send her vnto them, and let them seeke the performance of the rest how they can: for what neede you regard your promise, being out of their daunger. Argalt hearing his speeches, perceiuing hee could perswade him no way, was content with that. And with all, being easily drawne sleightly to forget his oathes to them made, thought that Maderas releasement would satisfie them, and be more then he needed to perform, therfore he resolued to send her to them presently with a message, that Pollipus could by no meanes be set at libertie. And comming to Madera , (who still continued in her heauie dumpes) he tolde her that her time of libertie was come) and that she should bee no longer detained in that place. Madera at the first gaue litle credence to his speeches, but perceiuing he ment as he spoke, thought that news very welcome, and so he let her out of the gate, attended by her two damzels, desiring her to tell the knights that sought her libertie, that Pollipus could by no meanes be released, but that they might speake with him if they would, whom they should see at a window right ouer the Castle bridge. Madera was soone espied of Panuamus , who knowing her, with dutifull reuence saluted her with his knee on the ground, whilest she with motherly teares reioyced to see him. And being met with Tellamor and Barzillus , she declared to them what Argalt had said concerning Pollipus , which when they heard, they were exceedingly tormented with vexation of the Gyants disloyaltie: yet notwithstanding, setting all doubts apart, they determined to trie if the Gyant ment true, that they might come to his speech, which was some comfort, and though they knew he would omit no opportunitie to betray them, yet they went to the bridge (hauing a carefull respect to their daunger) where according to Argalts message they found Pollipus , who knowing them, with great ioy welcommed them with these speeches. Deare friends (quoth he) you see how I am inclosed by treacherous meanes, comming to rescue the faire Ladie Venola , daughter to the king of Libia : here am I well and kindly vsed, therefore I praye tell me the occasion of your arriuall in this place? Most noble Knight (quoth Tellamor ) we reioyce at your health: we haue also found the vertuous Ladie Violetta , who remaineth in good health at yonder Ladies Castle, hauing indured many miseries before she came thither. He had not scarce ended those words, but Barzillus espied Brandamor with sixe knights in his company, crossing the chanell that incompassed the Castle with a boate, whom they were sure ment them no good: therefore they withdrew themselues from off the bridge, the better to withstand him: which Pollipus perceiuing, a thousand times wisht himselfe amongst them, beeing readie to teare the hayre from his head with extreame vexation. Brandamor beeing landed, presently with his mightie mace set vppon them with great violence, who to their vttermost indevors) resisted him most valiantly: but by reason of the great oddes (for all the Knights that were with him assayled them) they were in short space sore wounded, and brought in great distresse: which Panuamus perceiuing, left his mother, and came to their rescue, who likewise in short time by their cruel fight was greeuously wounded, that he beganne with the rest to faint and dispaire of victorie, notwithstanding they had slaine three of Brandamors Knights. Whilest they continued in this combat, Parismus by good fortune (hearing by a knight, of Venolas imprisonment) arriued there at the very instant, and espying their cruell combat, perceiuing the Gyant by his huge proportion to be one of them, and knowing Tellamor by his armour, suddainly rusht in amongst them, reaching so violent a blowe at Brandamor , that his armour on his left arme burst, and the blood issued out at the entrance his sword had made: and redoubling another blowe before Brandamor could lift vp his mightie mace, hee hit him so right vppon the Crest, that with the blow he made the fire to start out of his eyes. Tellamor and Barzillus presently knewe the Prince by his armour, which so reuiued their dismayed sences, that with great valour and resolution they renewed the fight against Brandamors other three knights, whilest Parismus dealt with the Gyant himselfe: who felt his prowesse to bee such, as was euery way able to cope with his great and mightie strength. Pollipus still standing at the windowe, sawe when Parismus came, whom by all likelyhoode hee thought he knewe to bee the Prince of Bohemia , which stirred such resolued courage in his heart, that with maine force he wroong a barre of yron from the windowe, wherewith he slewe his keeper, and so rauaged from chamber to chamber, vntill hee came to the place where Venola was, beeing continually attended and guarded by tenne knights: whom Pollipus nothing regarding his nakednesse, desperately assayled with his barre of yron, continuing so long fight, and with such courage, that hee had soone slaine the one halfe of them: and the other beeing terrified with his feare, fledde from him, and fast boulted and barred the doore, with such strong deuises, that it was imposible for him to get out that way. In which time the Gardyants made such an outcrye, that Argalte and all that remained in the Castle, presently armed themselues: and some issued out to Brandamor , and immediately set vppon Parismus and the rest, thinking by force to take them prisoners: but contrary to their thought, they withstoode them with great courage, especially Parismus layde about him with such violence, that many of them lost their liues by his strokes: but Brandamor still continued such egar pursuit against him, that he was most greeuously wounded: which so inraged him, that he draue his enemie to his vttermost shifts. Argalte being likewise issued out, with others in his company, with their multitude had slaine Barzillus , and brought Parismus to most estreame daunger of his life, who notwithstanding seeing Tellamor fallen downe, and vnder his enemies mercie, gathering courage a fresh, bestirred him, and with his valiant and braue courage saued his life from a great number that assailed him. In the meane time, Brandamor had respite to take new breath, but seeing now one of his knights, and then another drop downe dead by Parismus blowes, comming behinde the Prince, most like a cowardly traitor, he aduanced his mace to haue strooken him, but ere the Gyants blow was descended, there came a knight rushing his speare against him, and most violently ouerthrewe hym backwards: which done, drawing his swoord, and dismounting himselfe with great humblenesse and force, set his foote in Brandamors necke, and had not Argalt preuented him, he had parted his head from his shoulders: and likewise turning to Argalt , followed him with such violent pursuite, and draue at him with such swift and egar blowes, that he made him stagger and reele backwards. Now beganne the fight a fresh, continuing with such fury, that my vnskilfull penne wanteth abilitie to describe. Parismus beholding so valiant a Champion come in his rescue, reuiued his courage, & though he were most greeuously wounded, and neuer before in his life time brought to that extreame danger, yet his noble courage gathered such a new spirit, that brandishing his sword, and stepping from Tellamor (who by his succour was well refresht) presently sent the ghost of one of Brandamors seruants to hell, and after him another. In the meane time, most cruell fight continued between Brandamor and Argalt , against the new come knight, who both at once assayled him, till in the end Argalt vnable to indure any longer, by reason of the greeuous wounds he had receiued, with hideous grones gaue vp his ghost: the straunge knight likewise perceiuing the daunger Parismus and the other two knights were in, and how greeuously they were wounded, with all his force, and adding courage to his strength, ran with such violence at Brandamor with the poynt of his keene sword, that lighting on a broken place in his armour, it pearced him into the shoulderbone, where it stucke so hard, that he was compelled with a snatch to draw out the same, wherewith Brandamor let fall his mace, and this valiant Knight with a carefull eye looking backe on Parismus , saw him fallen downe in a traunce, procured by the exceeding aboundance of blood that issued from his wounds, and Brandamors seruants ready to make a finall end of his precious life: amongst whom hee rushed with such violence, that hee soone made them flie from their intent to saue themselues, in so much that none of them durst come within compasse of his sword, but betooke themselues to flight, some one way, some an other: in which time Brandamor was gotten in to the bridge, thinking to haue attained the Castle, which this Knight perceiuing, hasted after him, and ouertooke him on the middest thereof, and with his sword gaue him foure or fiue mortall wounds. The Gyant perceiuing himselfe so hard bested, and now fearing his euerlasting downfall, ran vpon this Knight, and with great force grapled him in his huge & boystrous armes, who being of an vndoubted courage, and fearieg no force, got vnder the Gyant, and with long striuing and strugling, at last ouerthrew him against the railes of the bridge, which being rotten, and not able to vphold his waightie carkasse, falling with such force, burst, and he fell downe into the chanell. That done, this noble knight nimbly catching vp his sword, pursued other of Brandamors seruants, who fledde into the Castle, intending to shut them out, but hee beeing warie to preuent such a mischiefo, slew the hindermost euen as he was entring the gate, that his dead bodie fell so right therein, that the other were thereby disappoynted, and he by that meanes got in, which they perceiuing, were so terrified with feare of him, that euery one of them fledde, and hid themselues from his sight. In which time Madera and her two maids seeing Brandamors ouerthrow, and all his seruaunts fledde, came to her sonne, who of all the three was nearest death, to whom she gaue breath by pulling off his helmet. Her damzels likewise came to Parismus , whose beuer they lift vp, and withall gaue him fresh ayre, afterwards pulling off his helmet, hee came to himselfe againe, being fallen into that trance by extreame heate, want of breath, and effusion of blood, but by the damzels indeuours was prettily recouered: and remembring himselfe, lookt earnestly about for the knight that came in such prosperous time to his rescue, and neither seeing him nor the Gyant, he maruelled what was become of him, that raising himselfe vp, he went with Tellamor towards the Castle gate, where he found that most valiant knight breathing himself whom Parismus embraced in his armes, saying. Most noble and couragious knight, whose prowesse hath redeemed our liues, and destroyed our enemies, what praises may I giue to your victorie? with what thankes may I gratulate your courtesie towards vs, that onely by your happy arriuall and high chiualrie, haue beene shielded from the tyranny of that cruell homicide, and cut him off from executing any more of his treacherie? If euer it may lie in my power, you shall both commaund me to requite your kindnesse, and bind me to you in all the vndissoluable bonds of true friendship. This knight thus replyed. I count my vndeseruing valour vnwoorthie the least estimation, much lesse to deserue such thankes at your hands, who before my comming had so weakned my enemies, that it was an easie taske for me to accomplish his ouerthrowe: but if it were in my power to performe any such deed as you ascribe to me, I would most willingly doo my best to pleasure you, who attribute that commendation to mee, that by all right belongeth to your selfe. I thanke you most hartily (quoth Parismus ) hereafter trusting to be both better acquainted with you, and of better abilitie to requite your kindnesse: by this time, Madera had brought Panuamus to his sences, who was entred the Castle, being supported by his mothers two damzels, for of himselfe was not able to stand. Parismus demaunded of Tellamor if he knew him? My Lord (replyed Tellamor ) this knight is sonne to this auncient Lady, whom came hither with me and the valiant Barzillus , to redeeme her that this day was prisoner in this Castle, and by vs released, as I will declare to your honour hereafter. In whose Castle (scituate not farre hence) remaines Violetta in good estate, and kindly vsed. And may it be (quoth Parismus ) that Violetta is yet liuing, and in safetie, what ioy will that be to Pollipus , if he might come to knowledge thereof, who no doubt is trauelled farre hence in her search: Not so my Lord (replyed Tellamor) Pollipus hath knowledge of her being there, who is prisoner within this Castle, and to day was in good health. Then (quoth Parismus ) what further cause haue we of sadnesse, but onely for the death of Barzillus , whom I was euery way beholding vnto: which wee must ouerpasse with forced patience, and let vs seeke out Pollipus , who I know will reioyce to meete vs here: then turning to Panuamus , he most louingly embraced him, the like hee did to Madera : and taking the knight (whom vnknowne) by the hand, he desired his company to search for Pollipus and the Lady Venola , whose imprisonment was the cause of both their arriuals there) who willingly went with him, before their departure making faste the gate, that none could enter or go out. As they entred into the Hall, there were diuers of the Gyants seruants, who willingly submitted themselues to their mercies. Parismus told them, if they ment faithfully, he would no way offend them: which they assured him of by many protestations. Then (quoth hee) one of you direct vs to the place where the Lady Venola remaineth: but they made answere. We dare not come thither, for there is with her a knight, that hath slaine fiue of our fellowes, who likewise will vse vs no better, if we come within his reach. Well (quoth Parismus ) come, I will be your warrant. How Parismus met with Pollipus and the Lady Venola , and of the ioy was made, but especially for the knight of Fames arriuall. Then Brandamors seruaunts conducted them to the chamber doore, which was fastned with so many barres, that it was long before they could vndo the same. Pollipus (as before is said) hauing slaine Venolas Gardiants, and seeing that he could by no meanes get out, came to Venola , desiring her not to be dismayed to see his rudenesse. For (quoth he) there are diuers knights in fight with the Gyant, amongst whom is the most valiant Prince of Bohemia , vnto whom I would willingly haue gotten downe, for I greatly feare his death, being beset with the Gyant and a number of his seruants. Sir (quoth Venola ) do not thinke me one whit dismayed with your presence, but wish you all happy successe, and the ouerthrow of your enemies: and fortunate had that woorthie Prince been, if he had not arriued heere, for Brandamor by his treacherie, no doubt will betray his life and libertie. Then both togither stepping to the window, saw the combattants, and beheld the daunger Parismus was in, and the comming of the straunge Knight to his rescue, and withall, how valiantly hee ouerthrewe the Gyant, which when he had seene, he thought in his fancie that hee had neuer before beheld so valiant and comely a knight. And also noting the carefull regard he had of Parismus , he exceedingly wondred what he might be, that his minde was drawne to a great affection towardes him, entring into these speeches. Most faire Princes, did you euer behold a goodlier, or more valianter knight then yonder is, who by his onely prowesse hath ouercome such enemies? do you not beholde how carefully and valiantly hee hath rescued the Prince? which maketh me so much the more maruell what he should be: for neuer in my life did I before this see him: such valor, such courtesie and comelinesse, did I neuer beholde in any: with the one, he hath left his foes slaughtered: with the other, preserued the Prince. Pollipus had no sooner ended his words, and Venola readie to make answere, but they heard some vnbolting the doore, which made him again betake himselfe to his bar, but when he beheld Parismus and the rest entring, he ranne to him, embracing him with such kindnesse, as true and loyall friends might proffer: he did the like to the straunge knight and the rest. Parismus seeing so beautifull a Lady in his company, so gorgeously attired, and attended by so many damzels, thought that was the Princesse Venola , whom he most kindly saluted, whose heart melted into teares of ioy, for her deliuerie and their victorie: after that, such courteous greetings past on euery side, as would be tedious to describe, but suppose them to be such as proceeded from the depth of ioy. Presently Parismus, Tellamor , and Panuamus , were vnarmed, to haue their wounds drest, which taske the Ladie Madera vndertooke, which when she had performed, dinner was brought vp by Brandamors seruants, who had all submitted themselues to the Conquerours. The straunge knight all this while was prouiding things necessary, with as much diligence as might be, that all in generall wondred at his courtesie, who would not vnarme himselfe, vntill hee had well ordered matters for their securitie, not trusting to the trueth of Brandmors seruants. And when they were readie to take their repast, Parismus desired him to vnarme himselfe, and not longer to conceale what he was from their knowledge. (For Parismus thought him to be some Knight that knew him. Venola likewise supposed him to bee some Knight that sought her loue but both were deceiued.) Now this Knight was the Knight of Fame , the occasion of whose comming thither, shall be declared in the next Chapter, who being drawne by naturall instinct, so much reuerenced Parismus , that he thought he could not sufficiently expresse his loue towards him, and though hee neuer saw him before, yet such a secret impression of reuerence towards him, was stirred in his heart, that he desired nothing more, then to be gracious in his sight: and although he had not the least thought that Parismus was his father, nor he one perswasion that the other might bee his sonne, yet both their hearts were stirred with an earnest and deuoted expectation of friendship, and nearnesse of acquaintance. And the Knight of Fame noting by the others behauiour, that Parismus was some great personage, hearing him desire him to discouer himself, made this answere. Right noble Knight, at your commaund I will vnarme my selfe, being a far borne straunger to this countrie, neither haue I any acquaintance in this place, but by misaduentures forced to wander through the world, to seeke that which I haue not yet found, nor scarce knowe if I meet withall, being onely fortunate to arriue in this place, to make some triall of my strength in your defence: which said, he presently vnarmed himselfe. Parismus beholding his youth, beganne (with all the rest) to admire his valour, accompanied with such young yeares, that embracing him in his armes, hee could not by that courtesie expresse his good will towards him. The Knight of Fame likewise reuerently kissing Venolas hand, said. Most noble Lady, my comming to this place, was to set you at libertie, and also to reuenge the death of the courteous Knight Tyrides , sonne to the good Duke Amasenus of Thrace , vnto whom I am infinitly bound: that had I a thousand liues, I would venture them all in his behalfe that is now dead. And seeing by the daunger and valour of these knights, you are set at libertie, and released from bondage, be of good comfort, for the King your father will soone bee heere, with thousands of Knight to conduct you safely into Libia , who at my last being in this Court, was making great preparation for this expectation. Venola made this reply. Courteous Knight, I yeeld to you and this noble Prince, all humble thankes for your kindnesse, being all the reward my maiden estate can affoord: and for the newes you bring of my fathers approach, that can yeelde no such quiet to my heart, as your happy victorie hath done: which hath expeld those infinit troubles, wherewith I was on euery side compassed: and in steed of care, replenisht my heart with comfort. These ceremonious salutations past, they went to dinner. Pollipus diligently noted the knight of Fame , his countenance, proportion, and gesture, thinking in his fancie, he neuer sawe a knight more like Parismus : that his minde was inwardly stirred with a great desire to knowe his name and birth. After dinner was ended, Parismus with Pollipus and Tellamor , grew into conference about Violetta : determining the next morning eyther to go to the place where she was, or to fetch her thither. Venola shee continued in conference with the olde Lady Madera , entring into many exceeding commendations of the valour of those three knights, Parismus, Pollipus , and the knight of Fame . But the knight of Fame withdrawing himselfe into a priuate place, reuolued his cares in these cogitations. How vnfortunate am I of all knights liuing, to bee tormented in such restlesse cares as daily torment me, and am subiect to so many and innumerable troubles, as none but my selfe could indure: first my birth and Parents vnknowne: next, my troubles in Thrace : and the taske imposed me by Venus , to find out the Lady she shewed me in the vision, whom I was in hope had beene the faire Lady Venola , but contrary to my expectation, I am still allotted to indure more miseries in her search. Tush (quoth he) may not Venola be the same Lady she ment? is she not faire, noble, and vertuous? may not I bee deceiued by that vision, and so driuen to consume my time in purchasing my owne torment? do not dreams often fall out false and vaine? Tut, why do I make these doubts? Venola is faire, yet nothing comparable to the same I serue, whose sweete Idea is perfectly fixt in my remembrance. Venola is both noble and beautifull, yet the countenance of my beloued, countermaundeth that noblenesse: and that vision cannot prooue fallible, neither can I account it any labor, if I indure a thousand more miseries in her search, so that in the end, I may obtaine her heauenly sight. How should I come to any knowledge of her abode? which way shuld I direct my steppes in her search? shall I first seeke my Parents, or shall I giue ouer my care for them, and imploy all my indeuours to finde her? such a choas of confused cares doo oppresse my sences, that I knowe not what to determine whose counsell to follow, or what aide to implore. If I knew in what continent of the world she were harboured, then would I with some comfort direct my steppes thitherwards: and shun no danger though neuer so doubtfull, to purchase her good liking. Well, I will pacifie my selfe with constrained countenance, and patiently indure the hardest extremitie. In these and such like complaints he spent some time, and afterwards came and accompanied Parismus and the rest, who spent that night in quiet, resoluing vpon other matters the next morning. In this Chapter is declared, the cause why the knight of Fame departed from Thrace : and how by the way hee arriued in Libia , and from thence came to Brandamors Castle. After that the knight of Fame had won the chief honour of the triumph, in the Court of the king of Thrace ,  & had giuen away the kings daughter to Remulus , with her fathers consent thereto, & the solemnization of the wedding past and performed with great royaltie, the king calling to mind the valor of the knight of Fame , & how prodigally he gaue Phylena to another, whose beautie might haue satisfied a mightie Potentates liking: and withall, how little he regarded his heire, by which meanes afterwards, hee might haue come to the highest type of dignitie, and to the high honour to bee king and Queen of so mightie a nation: wondred what might mooue him to refuse those offers: sometimes thinking it proceeded from want of wisedome: then againe he supposed, a knight indued with such bountifull and rare gifts of prowesse, could not chuse but likewise enioy sufficient wisedome, to consider the valiew of such gifts. And entring into a further cosideratio therof, he bega to coniecture that he was sprung of some great parentage, which might be the cause therof, and for that he was vnknown, he thought that to be the very truth. The again he cald to remembrance what Amasenus had told him, about his comming into that countrie, that he was by these thoghts grown into such a desire to be satisfied therin, that he sent for the knight of Fame , and in the presence of the Queen, Amasenus, Remulus , & Phylena & all the assembly of gallant knights that came to the triumph, he said as followeth. Woorthie knight, whom I so much affect, that if it in my power lye, to do you any more honour then I haue heretofore proffered, I would willingly do it, for your valour deserueth euerlasting commen- I haue offered you my daughter in marriage, and withall, intended to haue adopted you my sonne and heire, both which you haue refused, yeelding your interest in my daughter to Remulus , and therewith left the inheritance I adioyned to her marriage, which were both woorthie of regard, for that such gifts are seldome giuen: which maketh me send for you, desiring to be satisfied of your comming in the one, and also to know of whence, and what you are, if I can without offence to you, obtaine the same. The Knight of Fame made this reply. Most high and mightie king, I will vnfold the truth of all, to satisfie your demaund: I confesse your Maiestie did so much honour me, as my life shall be alwaies ready at your command, in requitall of the same: and your Princely gifts are of such estimation, as I confesse my selfe far vnwoorthie to possesse them: but that they might haue beene bestowed of the greatest Potentate in the world, which I neither refused, nor lightly esteemed, but alwaies regarded, as of precious and inestimable valiew: not drawne thereto by any want of consideration of their woorthinesse, but for the honourable respect I beare to loyaltie. For should I haue presumed to haue wed your Princely daughter, I should haue done her great iniury, and thereby parted the vnited hearts of true and loyall friends. For pleaseth your Maiestie, at the first I intended with a ioyfull heart to haue claymed my interest in that sweete Princesse loue: but I was commaunded the contrary by an vnwoonted meane, (which if it so please you, I will in priuate vnfolde) as also perceiuing the true friendship betwixt her and that noble knight Remulus , past with consent of both their hearts: I should haue esteemed it eyther in my selfe, or in any other, an act of great dishonour and impietie, to part those firmed bands of friendship, which if I had desolued, might haue turned their sweete intent, into discontented miserie: neither could I so rudely presume to challenge interest in so sweete a Ladies loue without desert, which is not attained by armes, but by loyaltie: which was the cause that I yeelded my interest to him, that had taken possession in her gentle heart, before my comming. And for my birth, I know not my Parents, but the trueth of all that is manifested to me, the noble Duke Amasenus hath made you priuie vnto. The king hearing his answere, greatly commended his honourable minde, saying: Thou woorthie knight, if there be any meanes left wherein I may pleasure you, do but aske, and you shall assuredly obtaine whatsoeuer it bee, for which kinde and kingly proffer, the knight of Fame with all humilitie gaue him thankes. Whilest they were in this communication, there suddainly entred in to the Hall foure knights in mourning attire, carrying on their shoulders a coffin couered with blacke, by their countenances pretending the discouerie of some tragicall euent. The king of Thrace seeing this sadde spectacle, greatly maruelled of whence they should be, and what heauie newes they brought: and they beeing come neare to the place where the king was, setting downe their hearse, spake as followeth. Most high and mightie king of Thrace , wee are knights belonging to the king of Libia , who kindly greeteth your Maiestie by vs, requesting you to take no offence at our rude message, the occasion whereof is this. It is not vnknowne, that the king our Lord hath but one onely daughter, named Venola , who on a day riding foorth on hunting, beeing by a tempest seuered from her traine (being accompanied by many knights, amongst whom was Tyrides , a knight of Thrace , vnto whose custodie the king committed her) and was vnawares surprised by the Gyant Brandamor , (that dwelleth in a Castle in the Forrest of Arde ) and by him by violence carryed away, whom the noble knight Tyrides pursued, but the Gyant (too mightie a foe for him to cope withall) slew him, and so conueyed the Princesse into his Castle: whose corpes we haue (according to our kings commaund) brought hither. Amasenus hearing this report, ranne vnto the dead body of his sonne, breathing foorth such lamentations, that it would haue made the very rockes to haue rent at his sorrowes: whom the king comforted by all possible meanes he could, but greefe for his sonnes vntimely death, ouerwhelmed and opprest his heart with such passions of desperate care, that he fell into an extreame sicknesse which (his olde age not being able to outweare) within fewe daies ended his life. Amasenus death (who was generally beloued) turned their mirth into sorrow, and their ioy into sad preparation for mournfull funerals, for the two dead knights, which was afterwardes performed in most stately manner. The knight of Fame seeing his deare friend Amasenus dead, hearing of Venolas imprisonment, resolued in requital of some part of Amasenus his friendship, to reuenge Tyrides death on the Gyant: besides his minde was affected with such a desire to see the Lady Venola , that giuing no respite to delay, he presently after the rights of Amasenus funeralles was performed, made his intent knowne to the king, and with all reuerence tooke his leaue of him. Likewise diuers Knights that came to the triumph and still remained in the kings Court, being growne into great familiaritie with the Knight of Fame , and desirous to make triall of their valour against the Gyant, departed likewise toward Libia , with the Knights that brought the dead body of Tyrides , amongst whom was the King of Aragon , named Archilacus, Guido of Thrace, Trudamor of Candie, Drio of Cicill , and Tristramus , one of the three brethren, and within fewe daies arriued in Libia , where the King hearing of their intent and cause of their comming, entertained them most royally. The Knight of Fame remained in the Court of the King of Libia some two daies, where his entertainment was most courteous and honourable, which might haue drawne a resolute determination to haue taken delight therein, but hee thought all time, though entertained with all varitie of pleasure, tedious: all delicate fare and costly banquetting, superfluous: and all company wearisome: hauing his cogitations opprest with care, his minde filled meditating on his Ladies sweete beautie, and his heart thirsting for reuenge of Tyrides death, respect no pleasure, nor affecting no delight, but to finde some knowledge of his vnkind Mistresse, wherewith to comfort his heart, seeing the King of Libia busie in making preparation to besiege Brandamor , and thirsting for honour, secretly departed towards the Forrest of Arde , where he arriued most fortunately to preserue his Princely fathers life, (thogh to him vnknown) as is declared in the former Chapter. How Pollipus and Tellamor departed from Brandamors Castle to Violetta and Clarina : and how as they were againe returning backe with them, they met with Brandamor , whom they supposed had been dead: and of the arriuall of the King of Libia in the Forrest of Arde . Castle, begunne to determine what to do, and at last concluded, because Parismus and Panuamus were greeuously wounded, and thereby not able to indure trauell, they should stay, and with them the knight of Fame to guard Venola, Pollipus and Tellamor , should depart towards Panuamus Castle, who taking kind farewels of Parismus , & the Knight of Fame , betooke themselues to their iourney, towards the place that harbored their chiefest delights, Pollipus being drawne with an exceeding desire to see his constant Lady Violetta , from whence he had beene long time seuered, and to recreate his sences, ouerduld with care, in the sweet solace of her pleasant company: the remembrance of which delight, filled his heart with exceeding affectionate content. Tellamor likewise had taken such a surfet with beholding Clarinas sweete beautie, that no phisicke but her beautie could cure the same: neyther could a thousand perils detaine him from thence: which hopefull conceit fed his heart with inward delight, that in these meditations, entermingled with diuers pleasant communications, they spent the time vntill they were near the Castle, where within short time they arriued: and dismounting themselues, came to the Porter, who knowing Tellamor , admitted their entrance, being conducted in by some of the seruants into the hall, and asking for the Lady Clarina , the wayting maide tolde them that she was in the Garden, accompanied by Violetta , offering to conduct them to the place. Nay (quoth Tellamor ) faire damzels, I pray let vs go alone: with that Pollipus and he entred into the Garden, and espied where they were seated vpon a greene bancke in communication, & pacing softly towards the place, they shelted themselues fro their sight, by a rosebush that was close by them, & heard their conferences which was this. Violetta leaning sadly vpon her elbow, her countenance bearing shew that a multitude of cares possest her heart, and Clarina was seated a litle distance off, tearing and dismembring the sweet flowers that she had carelessely cropt fro their stalkes. Violetta answering to som speech that Clarina had before vttered, said. Yea, my misfortunes haue bin too extream, & such as I thinke no creature euer bid the like, but my most vnhappy selfe: which now being ouerpast, would soon be banisht from my remebrance, might I once enioie the sight of my dear knight Pollipus : which hope hath been the only preseruer of my life. Oh (quoth Clariana ) happy, and ten times more then happy, in my fancie are Ladies that are wedded to such constat knights: but I feare me, there are too many of the contrary part: but I wish my brother and those two other courteous knights, such good successe, as to set him at libertie, that I might but behold him, whom you so highly commend. Yea (quoth Violetta ) that would be a happie day to me, but I greatly misdoubt, that will not suddainly come to passe, and I haue been so often crost in my desire, that my doubtfull heart will not suffer me to entertaine the least conceit of such felicitie: which said, the teares with aboundance fell from her eyes: which caused Clarina to do the like, and wept for company. Pollipus hearing Violettas speeches, and seeing her teares, could no longer withholde himselfe, but intreated Tellamor to discouer himselfe, & comming towards them, both of them espying them, at the first maruelled what they should be, but Violetta knowing Tellamor , thought the other had beene Barzillus, Tellamor comming to Clarina , greeted her ruddie lippes with a sweete kisse, saying. Most vertuous Ladies, we bring you happy newes of the safetie & releasement of your friends, and the death of Brandamor . Violetta well noting the other knights shield, had a mightie perswasion, that by his deuise he should be Pollipus , withall, marking his proportion, her heart sometimes fainted, and sometimes reuiued, and her colour went and came wonderfully: sometimes a pale colour appeared, which straight was ouerspredde with a rosiate blush, and such perplexities, one while of ioy, and againe another while of sorrow ouerwhelmed her heart, that the salt teares ouerflowed her eyes, and she turned backe to wipe them off, thinking to haue concealed the same. In which time, Pollipus had vnbuckled his helme, and discouered himselfe. Violetta hauing wiped off the deawe of her salt teares, lifting vp her head espied him, which suddaine ioy filled vp her sences, that she fell into his armes, not beeing able to vtter a word, whilest he louingly embraced her, reuiuing her sences with many sweet kisses: which done, he saide: Welcome my sweete delight, after so many cares, let vs now bid adue to greefe, and forget sad mischances. My deare Knight (quoth Violetta ) my trauels are now conuerted to easefull rest, and the conclusion of my miseries so sweete, as all the worlds ioyes cannot be compared therewith. Since I haue my Loue folded within the circuite of my embrace, since I enioy your company, which I haue long time wanted: since after my greefes, I am possest with such delightfull felicitie, whose pleasure may be compared to mine? what delight may equall my content? My care is banisht to comfort: woe with weale is controlde: paine conquered by pleasure: ioy vnited with ioy: and pleasure with delight, possesse my heart. Which words being ended, shee entertained him with such a sweete laborinth of kinde welcomes, that it would haue rauisht a disconted heart, with surfeting content to behold the same: which ended, Pollipus with great kindnesse saluted Clarina , and hauing not yet satisfied his fancie with ioy of Violettas welcome, sight, and sweete presence, he ledde her a side by the hand, delighting in each others company with inexplicable content. Which sorted to Tellamors desire, whose heart was inflamed with loues burning fire, that comming to Clarina with a submisse gesture, tooke her by the precious hande, saying. Most vertuous Lady, how happy are those that enioy such content as these two louers embrace, which maketh me esteeme my selfe vnfortunate, that haue not yet tasted those delights, but haue beene tormented with loues restlesse desire, neither could I euer settle my fancie to entertaine that diuine deitie, vntill I beheld your beautie, which hath tyed my heart in the strickt bands of loues obseruance, which hath seized my heart with vnwoonted passions, procured by the intire affections of my earnest deuotion to your perfections, that I humbly sue to your courtesie for pittie to my cares, beseeching you to conceiue aright of my meaning, & to moderate my greefes with the sweete salue of your clemencie. I presume thus boldly to commit my passions to your remembrance, procured by my restlesse desire, to be acceptable in your sight. I cannot boast of loyaltie, because hitherto you haue had no triall of my trueth, nor any cause to commend my desert, because the want of meanes to be imployed, hath kept me from performing any such duties: but I protest and promise as much as any true heart dare affirme, or the constantest friend may performe: therefore I beseech you sweete Mistresse, graunt your seruant some fauour, wherewith to comfort his poore heart, which hath deuoted it selfe euerlastingly to your obedience. Clarina hearing his speeches, hauing before growne into some good liking of them, and hauing some sparkes of infant loue kindled in her breast, and being somewhat willing to yeeld to loues assault, yet doubting his constancie, made this answere. Good seruaunt, what further fauour do you require, then that which I haue alreadie graunted For such passions as you speak of, I know not what they are: and withall, I thinke such suddaine loue cannot proceede from any firme foundation: neither would I wish you to make any such protestations or promises of dutie to me, that am neither woorthie thereof, nor expect any such, beeing the ordinarie speeches of light louers: with which I pray trouble not my quiet sences, for it cannot pleasure you, to disturbe my cogitations with loues vanities, when you your selfe are farthest off from the least respect of loyaltie: therefore as I haue vouchsafed you the fauor which with modestie I can affoord, I pray rest contented therewith. I but deare Mistresse (quoth he) loue, which you terme vanitie, is of such power, that it bringeth the free mindes subiect to her obedience, who hath taken such full possession in my heart, that no miserie or torment can remooue the same: then I beseech you, impute not me to be one of them that entertaine loue of custome, but let your clemencie conceiue a better opinion of my sute, which is grounded vpon the firmest foundation of perfect loyaltie: and though I confesse the fauour which you haue alreadie graunted me, is more greater then I haue deserued, or euer shall bee able to requite, yet extend your courtesie so farre, as to consider of my affection, that it may mooue your gentle heart to yeeld me loue: for otherwise I assure you, my life without that will be but greeuous: and my sorrowes so exceeding, that in the end, you will repent the crueltie you vsed: but I trust your vertues will not containe such rigor, but according to the courteous pietie that aboundeth in your gentle heart, you will yeelde my humble request, which shall both shewe your pittie, and bind me to you in all bonds of perfect constancie. Clarina thus answered him againe. Well seruant, your requests pearce so deep into my brest, that I promise you this further fauor, that according as I finde your deserts, I will giue credit to your speeches, and in the meane time take this comfort, that none shall remooue my good liking from you, vntill my selfe prooue you false. Tellamor hearing the sweete contents of those Nector breathing words, ended the rest of his speeches vpon her lippes, which Pollipus and Violetta had no time to note, beeing themselues euery way delighted with as sweete content: and afterwards comming all togither, they went into the Castle (delighting each in others sweeete company, espcially Clarina began to conceiue such good liking of her seruant Tellamor , that she tooke no other felicitie, but onely in his sight) where Pollipus declared to Clarina their happy victorie, and how that it was Maderas will she should depart with them to Brandamors Castle, which she willingly yeelded vnto, the rather thereby to enioy Tellamors company: and so the night approaching, Pollipus and his sweet Violetta betooke themselues to their rest, and Tellamor and Clarina to their seuerall lodgings, whose hearts wisht themselues the like happy content, they knew the other two shuld enioy, if their honor would haue permitted the. Early the next morning they departed towards the Forrest of Arde , being accompanied by twentie seruants belonging to Clarina , passing away the time in many delightfull speeches. Two of Clarinas seruants by occasion staid behind the rest of their company, and as they were newly entred the Forrest, they espyed the Gyant Brandamor crossing the way, which draue them into such feare, that like men bestraught of their wittes, they fled from him. Brandamor seeing that, pursued them, vntill he ouertooke one of them, and slew him, the other making the more hast, ouertooke his company, being so affrighted, that for a good space he could not vtter his mind: which draue them all into an admiration: afterwards breathing, he said that the Gyant Brandamor was aliue, and had slaine one of his fellowes. Pollipus hearing his speeches, wondred whence they should proceede: for that he and all the rest thought the Gyant had been drowned (wherein they were deceiued, for he hauing receiued the fall by the knight of Fame , with much ado scramled out of the water, which was not deepe ynough to drench his huge body) but giuing some credit to the fellowes speeches, Pollipus and fiue or sixe of the seruant went backe with him, and presently espied Brand . bearing in his had a strong yong plant, which he had plukt vp by the root, for his weapon: who seeing Pollipus & his company, knowing him, would haue fled: but Pollipus ouertaking him, beset him with such strickt besiege, that notwithstanding he laid about him with his mightie staffe, he soon broght him to his subiectio, causing his arms to be fast boud with cords. And in that sort they draue him before the, vntill they arriued at his castle, whither they were kindly welcommed by Parismus , who reioiced to see Pollipus and Violetta so happily met againe. And seeing Brandamor , they all both maruelled how hee had escaped death, and were glad they had him againe, to bee reuenged in more seuere manner, for the outrages he had done them. The knight of Fame noting the exceeding ioy of Parismus and Pollipus for Violettas safetie, and of Panuamus with his mother and sister Clarina . And noting Tellamors merrie countenance (procured by a great hope to attaine Clarinas loue) was drawne to a sad remembrance of his owne misfortunes, that was inioyned to a taske to find his Parents, and the Lady to whose seruice hee was dedicated, vnto whose beautie he was become so thralled, that his heart could harbour no conceit of ioy, but onely in meditating of her perfections, which by absence bredde thousands of cares in his head. And withall, he noted the Princesse Venolas pensiuenesse, whose affections he thought shuld best agree with his sadnesse, that he accompanied her in many communications. Word was brought them that the Castle was round begirt with souldiers, which the knight of Fame hearing, desired that he might go out to parley with them, to know whether they were fiends or foes, which they all gaue consent vnto, who arming himselfe, went foorth gallantly mounted, and found that it was the king of Libia , who before hauing some knowledge of the knight of Fame , knew him againe by his armour, maruelling to see him (contrary to his expectation) to issue out of his Castle. The knight of Fame comming towards him, said. Most mightie king, I as one of the Gardiants of this Castle, (hauing by the ouerthrow of Brandamor ) conquered the same, yeelde the same into your hands. The king hearing his speeches, most louingly embraced him, saying. Noble Knight, the report I haue heard of your knightly prowesse, are verified in this noble attempt, that haue subdued that hatefull contemner of honor, which none but your selfe could haue so valiantly performed. Noble king (quoth hee) there is within the Castle the most famous Prince of Bohemia , whose valor before my approach had so much weakned the Tyrants power, that my taske was easie to subdue him. The King hearing that, wondred what occasion had drawne Parismus into those parts, of whom he had knowledge in Thessalie . The king of Libia accompanied by Archillachus , with diuers of his knights was conducted by the knight of Fame into the castle, to the exceeding ioy of Venola , who with humble reuerence fell prostrate at his feete: he comming to Parismus , saluted him with great courtesie, who likewise returned him the salutation, and to the young Archilachus , and after that euery one in most kind and courteous manner saluted each other, spending the rest of the day in such content as the place yeelded. Of Brandamors death, and of the kings departure backe into Libia . How Venola was enamoured with the knight of Fame : How she deuised meanes to stay his departure with Parismus . How Tellamor , dissembled himselfe sicke, to stay in Clarinas company. And of other accidents that befell the knight of Fame . The next morning Brandamor was brought into the Hall, before the whole assembly of States, to whom Parismus said. Disturber of peace, the time of punishment draweth nigh, therefore declare to whom thou art prisoner, for but one was thy conquerour, at whose hands thou maist receiue reward according to thy desert? Brandamor made this reply. I yeeld my selfe thrall to that strange knight, by whose valour I was conquered: otherwise, not all the force the king of Libia hath brought, would haue preuailed against me. The knight of Fame hearing his words, said. Since thou haste yeelded thy selfe to me, I surrender my interest vnto the Princesse Venola , who may at her pleasure dispose of thee as she shall thinke good. Venola hearing the knight of Fames words, yeelded him thankes: desiring the king her father to appoynt his punishment, who caused him that day in the presence of them all, to be drawne in peeces by horses: which done, the king of Libia came to Parismus , requesting him before his returne into Bohemia , to soiorne some fewe daies with him, which he kindly accepted, with whom Pollipus , the knight of Fame , and Violetta , likewise departed: Panuamus staied still with his mother in Brandamors Castle, which by consent of all was giuen to him, in recompence of the iniuries hee had sustained. Tellamor seeing all things fall out contrary to his liking, could not deuise what meanes to vse to stay behinde, to enioy Clarinas company, without the which it was impossible for him to enioy any quiet: and casting in his minde all deuises he thought fittest, at last he famed himselfe extreamly sicke, which he performed so cunningly, that although they had suspected his drift, yet they could hardly haue espied his pollicie: by which means Parismus left him behinde, vpon his faithfull promise to come to him at such time as he was to depart from Libia . The king of Libia with great ioy, (hauing such noble and valiant knights in his company) where he was most ioyfully entertained by his Nobles, who hearing that Venola was released by the valour of onely two knights, which was Parismus and the knight of Fame applauded their victorie with great praises, and deuised all the meanes they could to increase their honourable entertainment. Likewise the Queene vsed many courtesies towards them, in requitall of their kindnesse: where were feastings, banquettings, maskes, and triumphs, performed by the knights there assembled, with exceeding pompe and pleasure: the chiefest honour whereof, redownded to the knight of Fame , whereby his fame is spredde into most places of the world. Venola noting his exceeding valour and beautie, and withall, how much his splendant fame was extolde in euery mans mouth, in recompence of the trauels he had indured to set her at libertie, vsed such extraordinarie kindnesse towards him, as hee might well haue perceiued to proceede from an vnusuall liking: and beholding the gifts of nature that abounded in him, shee beganne to bee intangled in loues bands, offering exceeding kindnesse to demonstrate her affections to him, to the intent hee should perceiue the same: which when she sawe took no such effect as she desired, it rather increased her desire, then any way mittigated the same: and she that had before refused many kings sutes, was now inthralled by her owne choise: and to such a one as made no shew or signe of such deuoted kindnesse as she expected in him. For many daies after, she vsed that extraordinary behauiour, which many began to note, thinking the same had beene procured by his sute, but he contrarily was nothing so affected, but his sences were so benummed with contemplating the perfections of his vnknowne Mistresse, that Venolas kindnesse (which many would haue taken as high fauours) were bestowed in vaine, which in time she well perceiued, maruelling that hee could not vnderstand her meaning: which agrauated her desires, that they grew as a burning flame, which so melted her yeelding heart, that nothing could sinke in her fancie, but how to giue him knowledge of her good will: that by the occurrence of these passions, she began altogither to delight in solitarinesse, vnlesse it were in his company. The time of Parismus departure being come, (which was appoynted the next morning) Venola was drawne into an exceeding feare, least that the knight of Fame would go with him, that she began to deuise what means to vse to stay him, which she could by no meanes of her self inuent, which draue her to her wittes ende, and in great heauinesse comming to her chamber, casting her selfe vpon her bedde, she vttered these complaints. What miserie may be compared to the torment I indure, procured by loue, which hath entagled me in her snares, and setled my liking on a straunger, that as carelesly regardeth my good will, as I earnestly affect his perfections? What extremitie is this, that my vnluckie destinies haue allotted me, to refuse the offer of the many kings that haue humbly sued for my loue, and to make choise of one that maketh least account of my kindnesse? for it canot be but he perceiueth my loue, which being so, how discurteous is he that in all this time will not yeeld me any recompence for the same? peraduenture he seeth nothing in me worth the liking, or else my beautie is not such, as many flatteringly haue perswaded me it is. Am I not a kings daughter, and he peraduenture borne of meane parentage? and what dignitie might he come to by my loue? but all this he regardeth not, but being rudelie brought vp, according to ye rudenesse, cannot conceiue of my liking. But what meane I to disgrace the knight, whose courtesie maketh him beloued of all, whose comelinesse maketh him liked of all, and whose valour maketh him honored of al: who hath no doubt, already placed his affections on some bewtifull Lady, and that is the cause of his strangenesse, yea that is the thing that hindreth my ioyes: for without his loue I ca attaine no quiet, which now I am likewise like to loose by his departure, which I fear me, wil be too soon: which words being ended, such passions ouerwhelmed her heart, that her eyes burst into teares, and there she laie vpon her bedde, tumbling with torment of those restlesse passions. Whilest she continued her sorrowes, in comes Flauia her nurse, who espying her cheekes besmeerd with teares, and her sad countenance, maruelling what should procure the same, said. My sweet Mistresse, how happeneth it that you weepe thus? who hath done you wrong? or why do you torment your sweete selfe with this sadnesse? Deare Lady tell me? Oh Nurse (quoth Venola ) my owne folly hath procured me this disquiet: and my selfe being the cause, whom should I blame but my selfe? Why, Lady (quoth she) what haue you done? what is the matter? haue you done your selfe any harme? why should you conceale any thing from me, that haue all your life long loued you as dearely as my owne heart? my sweete daughter hide nothing from me: but tell me why you marre those your prettie eyes with such sorrow? Why (quoth Venola ) what should it auaile me to tell you, when I know you cannot helpe me: and the matter is such, as both concerneth my life and credit, which if I should declare to you, and by that meanes come to my fathers knowledge, it would be more greeuous to me then death: then good Flauia , do not seeke to know my cause of care, but let me consume my selfe in silence, when I haue no other meanes of remedie. Flauia hearing her words, was the more desirous to knowe what the matter was, sometimes weeping, sometimes intreating her to tell it her, and sometimes protesting, that she would rather indure any torment, then reueale the same: that Venola wonne with her perswasions, teares, and protestations, and withall, desirous of comfort, imparted her whole minde vnto her: desiring to be both secret and trustie: and withall, asking her counsell how she might stay him from departing with the Prince of Bohemia . Lady (quoth Flauia ) since you haue imparted your minde to mee, I will both secretly keepe your counsell, and diligently labor to stay his iourney at this time. I but (quoth Venola ) I pray thee do it so, that hee may no way perceiue that it was by my procurement. Let me alone for that (saide shee) and in the meane time cast you off those clowdie cares, and get you downe amongst the rest of those Ladies, with a merrie countenance and commit the care to me, which I will effect to your liking. Venola beeing somewhat reuiued with Flauias promise, with a merrie heart forsooke her chamber. Flauia went about her businesse, going into the Citie with all haste, where dwelt an ancient Apothecarie, a very friend of hers, to whom she durst commit any secret, whom she desired to compound certaine of his drugges togither, and to make a somniferous potion, which would cause him sleepe for foure and twentie houres, in such sort, that the partie might by no meanes be wakened, promising if he could make such a confection, to reward him richly. The Apothecarie hearing her words, told her that if she would stay, he would compound such a drinke as should euery way worke the same effect she desired. Flauia hauing attained her desire that way, came to a Goldsmith and bought a most curious wrought bottell of gold, whereon she caused him to ingraue these letters. My pleasant taske doth doubts appease, I banish care and griefe vnkinde: Things yet vnknowne, I do reueale, Vnknowne he is that shall me finde. A friend vnknowne hath thee this sent, Be bold and taste incontinent. And hauing gotten euery thing according to her desire, returneth to the Court, and the time of rest drawing nigh, she wrought such means, that she had the appointment of the knights of Fames lodging, where she laide the bottell (in which she had put the somniferous potion) so right in his way, that he could not chuse but find the same, intending that if she failed of her purpose, yet she would worke such meanes, that shee would giue it him in the morning. The knight of Fame all that day kept company with Parismus , vnto whom his heart bare an inward loue, determining to bring him towards Bohemia , and afterwards to trauel in search of his Parents. Parismus likewise was growne into such loue of his quallities, and such a hidden desire to pleasure him, was stirred in his heart towardes him, that hee vsed him with such extraordinarie kindnesse, as the friendship that past betwixt them, seemed vnseparable. Thus the day being spent, euery one betook the to their lodgings: the Knight of Fame comming to his lodging, walking vp & downe lighted on the bottel, & noting the same, took it vp, & espying the verses, read the contents, which draue him into many cogitations how the same should come there: at last, among many other thoghts, he deemed by the contents of the verses, he was the man that should taste thereof. Then he began to feare least it might bee some poyson laid on purpose to betray his life, but that suspition was soone extinguished, by the desire he had to find ease to his doubts, which the contents of the superscription promised: that tasting a little of the liquor, & finding the same pleasant, being perswaded that it was conueyed by some diuine operation to procure content, he dranke it quite off, & presently went to his bed: which when Flauia saw, with a ioyfull heart she went to Venola , and declared vnto her what she had done. And afterwards leauing Venola to her selfe, shee came to an old acquaintance of hers, who at her request wrote a letter to Parismus in the name of the knight of Fame : which the next morning she deliuered to him: the contents whereof were these. Must noble Prince of Bohemia , my ful intent was for the vndeserued kindnesse I haue found in you, to haue atteded you towards Bohemia , but a contrary occasion hath withdrawne mee: therfore I desire your honor, both to pardon me,  & make no inquirie after me: for I will assoone as I haue ended my businesse, repaire to shew my dutie to you in the Bohemian Court: formal reuerence, I commit your worthinesse to all good fortune. A poore Knight vnknowne. Parismus reading the letter, maruelled what occasion had withdrawn him, but being therwith contented,  & trusting accordingly to see him in Bohemia , he made no other speech of him, but taking his leaue of the K. and Q. hauing in his company Pollipus & Violetta , with some 40. Knights of Libia , he departed towards Bohemia, Tellamor all this while remained in the forest of Arde , in company of his deare M. Clarina , so cunningly handling his businesse, that none could perceiue but that he was very sick indeed: in which time Clarina was his Phisitian, carefully tending him, & vsing a most extraordinary diligence, whose copany was more pleasant to him then anything else: that therwith, & other sweet fauors he receiued fro her kindnesse, he forgot his sicknes, & prosecuted his loue: which in time of his sicknesse had that good issue, that Clarina was no lesse tyed in the bands of loue, then he was. And vpon a time, whe Clarina was in his chamber vnaccopanied by any, he amogst other kindnesses, vttered these speeches. My sweete M. (quoth he) how much is your poore seruant beholding vnto you, that haue so tenderly regarded me, & taken such infinit paines about me, which maketh me so much boud vnto you, that my life is & shall be for euer dedicated to deserue this kindnesse: besides the affection which I beare to your diuine excellencies, maketh me presume to prosecute my sute vnto you, therby to bring my selfe farther in your debt: desiring you to yeeld pittie to my distresse & ease to my restlesse passions, procured by your beautie, which if you withold, soone wil care cosume my wearie life: neither can my heart attain to any quiet or content, without your loue, which I more esteem the either life or other thing that I enioy: therfore sweet M. defer my sute no longer, but now extend your fauor to my distresse, & grant me loue for my loue, wheron my chiefest felicitie dependeth. Good seruant (qd Clarina ) were I assured of thy constancie, soon shuldest thou know my mind, but some crosse or misfortune wil soon alter thy affectio, and so thou wilt leaue me in distresse: then what miserie may I incur by granting to thy sute? Sweet M. (quoth Tellamor ) if euer knight were true, the wil your poore seruant prooue trustie: if euer hart harbored costancie, the be you assured, that costant loue possesseth my heart: for so intire are my deuotions to remain unmooueable, that no misfortune, calamitie, &c. shall cause me falsifie my faith, but rather let all plagues and vnfortunate miseries light vpon my head. Clarina hearing his speeches, made this reply. Wel deare seruant, since I see thy faithfulnesse, & how diligent thou hast bin to win my fauor, I yeeld both my loue & my self into thy possessio, which hereafter account as thine own to dispose of: & be thou assured notwithstading my strangenesse, my loue hath euery way equalled thine, & the like good will I bear to thee, hath euery way equalled thy affections: & with so free a heart I giue my life & loue into thy hands, as willingly as thou desirest to haue the same. Tella , hauing receiued this assurance of her loyaltie, to reuiue his sences withall, entertained that comfort, & her sweet presence with great delight, leauing of his sute, & spending the time in imbracings. Many daies cotinued these true louers in great pleasure, being grown to ye familiaritie, yt oftentimes such kind fauors past betwixt them, that Cla . ouercome by his intreaties, yeelded vp her fortres of virginitie vnto him: ofte- frenquenting each others company, in that kind sort tasting their stolne pleasure with great delight, vntil the newes of Parismus returne came to their knowledge, (and Tellamor bound thereto by oath, must needes depart) which strooke an extreame sadnesse to both their hearts. But especially Clarina tooke the same so heauily, that no perswasion could adde comfort to her heart. The remembrance of whose departure, ouercame her with such passions of greef, that being in her chamber alone, she vttered many mournfull plaints, and withall, such aboundance of teares, that a heart of the hardest Adamant, would haue resolued at her lamentations: to ease which greefe, she deuised how to enioy his company, if it were possible, to the last houre of his departure, and by the counsell of one of her damzels named Ancilla , she wroght such means that she enioyed his company that night. Tellamor being a knight of honourable conditions, labored all that he could to leaue her contented, and performe his faithfull promise to Parismus : then before his departure, taking his leaue of Madera and Panuamus , who so well liked his company, that they were vnwilling to leaue the same. After which hee went to bedde, thinking to take his farewell of Clarina betimes in the morning, when none but themselues should be priuie thereto: but shee poore Lady beeing fast fettered in the snares of loue, hauing contriued euery thing for her securitie: when he was in his dead sleepe, approached to his bed side, with a cleare burning taper in her hand, where she stood a great while, being vnwilling to interrupt his quiet sleepe, reuoluing many thoughts in her troubled head. At last she could not chuse but touch his manly hand, which hung ouer the beddes side, wherewith she waked him, who being scarcely out of his drowsie sleepe, espying his beloued standing by his beddes side, could not of a suddaine conceit her beeing there, but at length hauing reuiued his sences by rubbing his eyes, he tooke her by the hand, and wanne her consent to come into the bed, where he entertained her with many sweete embracings and pleasant conference: who tooke no small delight in his company, after much time (which they thought too short) spent in kindnesse. Clarina demaunded when he would returne, for (quoth shee) my life is nothing without your presence: neither shall I attaine the least quiet in your absence: therefore I beseech you, haue regard of my honour, which I haue yeelded into your handes, and when you are amongst your friendes in Bohemia , be not unmindfull of poore Clarinas loue, who hath committed her life, honour and chastitie, into your gentle custodie. Most deare Clarina (quoth Tellamor ) my returne shall be as speedy as may be, for like as you, my self shall neuer enioy one minutes respite of content, without your heauenly company, whereon my chiefest felicitie dependeth: and as you haue yeelded al that I can desire, or you graunt, into my vnwoorthie keeping, I will as carefully labour to preserue the same from all spot of dishonour, hoping at my returne, to enioy the possession of your loue, as well by generall consent of your friends, as by your courtesie I haue attained their diuine fruition in priuate. Then I beseech you, let no disquiet disturbe your peace, let no doubt trouble your fancie, nor any suspence of my loyaltie ake roote in your heart: for sooner shall the sea become drie land, the Sunne and Moone loose their cleare light, and all things turne to their contrary, before Tellamor will any way falsifie his faith. In these and such like speeches (entermingled with many delights) they spent that night, taking their leaue each of other, with many a ceremonious fare well, and parting with many a heauie sigh and sad teare, thinking that with each others sight, each others life had parted. Tellamor according to his promise, arriued in Libia , euen at the time of Barismus departure, whom we will leaue onwards of his iourney towardes Bohemia . The Knight of Fame hauing slept his fill, and longer a great deale then he determined, awaked within two daies after Parismus departure, little thinking the Prince had beene gone, but beginning to arme himselfe, Flauia comming to him, said as followeth. Worthie Knight (quoth she) I am glad to see that you are well, which vntil now I doubted. The Knight of Fame wondring at her speeches, saide. Gentlewoman, as yet I haue not beene sick, then why do you make any question of my health? Indeed sir (quoth she) I see now you haue not beene sicke, but you haue slept very long, for I haue been your keeper here this two daies, euer since the Prince of Bohemia departed, who thought to haue had your company some part of the way, but seeing your sleepe, (from which you could not be wakened) hee imparted his minde to the Ladie Venola , who hath giuen me especiall charge to attend you diligently. Hee hearing her speeches, was amazed in his thoughts to thinke of them, entring into many cogitations what should be the cause of his sleepinesse, which hee perceiued was the potion which hee had tasted, that he was exceedingly inraged with himself, that he thereby was disappoynted of Parismus company, whom hee esteemed aboue all the knights that euer he had met withall, and making a vertue of necessitie, blaming himselfe for his sleepinesse, he went downe into the company of other knights, making the best excuse he could thereof. Flauia in the meane time went to Venola , and tolde her all that had happened: and what she had told him of Parismus departure: wishing her to deuise what she thought best to satisfie his minde. The Knight of Fame being desirous to know what message Parismus had left with Venola , meeting with Flauia , desired her to certifie her Mistresse that he attended her pleasure, to know what the Prince of Bohemia had tolde her as concerning him. Flauia hearing his speeches, brought him into a gallerie, where shee desird him to stay, and she would go bring him answere presently: so comming to Venola , she tolde her thereof. Venola then hauing ridde her chamber of all company, willed her to bring him in, whom shee welcommed with vnwoonted kindnesse: and taking him by the hand, desired him to sit downe by her vppon the beddes side, to whom shee said as followeth. Most courteous knight, the Prince of Bohemia willed me to certifie you, that he would within four daies returne to this place, to desire your company in executing a secret of importance: desiring me, that I would intreate you to stay here some fewe daies, and at his returne hee will requite that kindnesse: therefore I pray (quoth shee) bee my guest for so long time, for I haue receiued such benifits by your courtesie, as I would willingly (if it lay in my power) requite the same. I thanke your excellencie (quoth hee) for proffering mee such kindnesse, acknowledging my selfe both vnwoorthie thereof, and vnable to requite the same: being so much the more willing to stay Parismus returne, thereby to shewe my dutie to your request: and seeing you vouchsafe mee to bee your Guest, hauing yet deserued no such kindnesse, pleaseth you to commaunde or imploy mee any way, and I will most willingly vndertake any trauell to procure your content: which wordes hee spake, little knowing what passions had possest her heart, whom shee vsed so kindly, and entertained with such louing glaunces, that hee beganne greatly to commend her courtesie: and maruelled why she vsed him with such kindnesse, that would haue pearced the heart of any other knight, but onely himselfe, whose affections were setled on his inward deuoted Lady: that Venolas loue was bestowed in vaine, and shee spent her sighes and good will in a barren soyle, where shee wept in hope of recompence: which draue her to such extremitie of greefe, that shee was often in minde (hauing him so fitly in her company, and fearing to loose so sweet opportunitie) to reueale her loue to him her selfe, but that purpose was suddainly altered by contrary thoughts, that shee sate rackt with so many and so extreame cogitations, that the greefe on the one side, that hee could not conceiue of her liking, by so many euident tokens as shee had shewen thereof, and her owne passions ouerwhelmed her heart with such care, that shee suddainly burst into aboundance of teares, and so rose from the bedde and went to a window. The knight of Fame maruelling what should bee the cause of her sadnesse, thinking that his company could but disquiet her, departed her chamber, which shee perceiuing, was ouercome with such passion, that she fell downe dead: wherewith Flauia gaue such shrikes, that the knight of Fame hearing her outcrie, suddainly returned, and finding Venola in that estate, did the best he could with the Nurse to recouer her sences: which at last beganne to turne to their woonted vses. Venola lifting vp her eyes, and espying the knight of Fame holding her in his armes, wisht that she might for euer haue continued in that trance, who carrying her to the bedde, their laide her downe, and Flauia and other Damzelles by that time tooke her into their custodie: which caused him to depart againe: after whom Venola cast such a greedie looke, accompanied with such scalding sighes, that Flauia feared she would haue fallen into the like trance againe. After that shee was well recouered, and all her attendants departed, Flauia said as followeth. Why deare Mistresse (quoth she) how immoderately doo you gouern your selfe to fall into these extreames? I beshrew my heart, if I do not repent that euer I vndertooke to bee an acter heerein. What, haue you no more wisedome, but so fondly to dote on a stragling knight, that cannot, or at the least will not vnderstand your meaning, taking a delight to see your torment, for it is impossible but that hee should perceiue your loue towards him: then be not so affectionate towards such a one as neither regardeth loue, nor knoweth what belongeth to courtly ciuilitie. Peace, peace, (quoth Venola ) either fill my eares with the sound of better words, or else hold thy tongue: for I tell thee, it is more odious vnto me then death, to heare thee so much disgrace the Prince of courtesie: for in him remaine all honourable parts, whose presence is more pleasant vnto me, then all the proffered seruices of al the knights in the world: and if thou canst comfort me no better then by these speeches, keepe secret what thou knowest, and hereafter thou shalt know no more of my mind. For I imparted the same to thee, thinking to haue fomfort by thy counsell, but thou contrarily, addest care to my greefe. Sweete Mistresse (quoth she) I beseech you do not conceiue so hardly of my meaning, for I speake nothing but with intent to procure your good: and rather will I teare my accursed tongue from foorth of my head, then it shall hereafter vtter a word to displease you. Then (quoth Venola ) once againe counsell me what to do, for thou seest how farre I am tied in the bonds of loue to that woorthie knight, that without some hope of comfort, my cares will bee exceeding, and more then my poore heart will be able to indure. This I thinke (quoth Flauia ) is the best to be done, either do it your selfe, or let me giue him knowledge of your loue, and then you shall soone see whether hee will accept thereof or no. Do so then (quoth Venola ) I commit all to thy discretion. The knight of Fame being departed Venolas chamber, was as farre from conceiuing the cause of her passion, as hee was from the knowledge of all things, and being walkt into a Garden alone by himsefe, Flauia came to him, whom he kindly greeted, asking her how her Mistresse did. Sir knight (quoth shee) in the same case you left her, and rather worse, the cause of whose disquiet is procured by no disease, but by an extraordinary occasion, which none but one can remedie, which I would willingly giue the partie knowledge of, but that I knowe not whether he will take the same kindly or no. Else wer he much to blame (quoth he) for hard were his heart, that would not pittie the distresse of so diuine a creature. Gentle sir (quoth she) thus it is. My Lady hath euer since the first sight of your person, beene greatly tormented with loues passions, which is the cause of her sicknesse, which resteth onely in your power to salue. The knight of Fame hearing her speeches, was so suddainly astonisht, and therewith drawne into such cogitations, that he stood a good while like one in a trance, at last he said. The harder is her happe, and the woorse my misfortune, for I am vnwoorthie of such kindnesse, and vnable to yeeld her recompence: which words being spoken, he turned himselfe from her, being drawne into such a deepe meditation, that he regarded not, nor scarce heard some words Flauia spake to him afterwards, who thinking that he had of purpose contemned her, departed in a monstrous rage: and being alone by himselfe, cogitating vppon these euents, perceiued that her former kindnesse had proceeded from the same roote of affection, greatly condemning himselfe of dulnesse, that could not before that perceiue the same: wishing that he had departed with the Prince of Bohemia , for that his fancie could by no meanes be drawne to the least good conceit of her loue: for his heart was wholly imployed an other way. Then he beganne to call to remembrance the somniferous potion he had tasted, by which means he was disappoynted of Parismus company, reuoluing euery consideration and circumstance of the same and these euents, was in the ende fully perswaded, that it was purposely done by Venola , or some by her appointment, to stay him there: which thought was so fully grounded in his fancie, that he assuredly perswaded himselfe that was the very trueth, and none else: which draue him into many studies how to rid himselfe from thence, at last he determined to depart in secret and vnknowne to any. And with this resolution, all that day he accompanied the rest of the Knights, thereby to shun all occasions of hearing any further speech of Venola . Who hearing how scornfully hee had receiued Flauias message, (which Flauia had told her) entred into such extream complaints against her hard fortune, and shed such abundance of teares, that the bed whereon shee lay was watered therewith: in which estate she continued tormenting her selfe with extreame cares. Early the next morning, the knight without the knowledge of any departed, clogged with such a chaos of confused cares, as that he wisht the date of his wearie life (subiect to so many crosses) were expired, intending neuer to returne thither, whom Flauia soone mist: the news, whereof, she conueyed to the hearing of Venola , who tooke the same so heauily, that many daies shee continued as one likelier to entertaine death, then to suruiue: which draue her Parents into an extreame sadnesse, from whom she still concealed the cause of her greefe. In which estate for a while we will leaue her and the knight of Fame onwards on his iourney, and Clarina in great care for the absence of Tellamor , in the forrest of Arde . How the knight of Fame arriued in Natolia : and by what means he found the Lady hee sawe in the vision: and the combat hee fought with Collimus . After the knight of Fame was departed the King of Libias Court, to avoyde the loue of Venola , hee trauelled many daies without any aduenture, tired with extreame care and desire to come to the knowledge of his Parents, and to finde his deuoted Lady, that when the Sunne was at the highest, and by that meanes the season very hotte, hee alighted from his horse in a pleasant valley, where sitting vnder the shadowe of a Chestnut-tree, hee entered into this communication to himselfe. What crosses still prosecute my steppes, that I can in no place bee at quiet, but am still troubled with that which I would not, but cannot finde the thing I desire? My birth day was the beginning of my sorrowes: since which time, nothing but care hath fallen to my share, whereas I see other knights enioy their hearts content. My Parents hidden from my knowledge, my selfe trauelling to finde them, peraduenture go rather a great way from them, then to them: for the Iland of Rockes , from whence I came, and where I was brought vppe, is farre distant from this place: and I thinke if I would come to their knowledge, it is my best course to returne thither againe. Was I not ouerfoolish, to refuse the marriage of Phylena the kings daughter of Thrace , vppon vaine confidence of a dreame? vppon whose certaintie I can no way builde, which might bee procured by some Sorcerie of Remulus , to make mee refuse that honour, to the intent hee might install himselfe therein, and cause mee to dote on the beautie of a Lady that is no where to bee found: for the whole world containes not such an essence of perfect beautie, as that which I behelde? Then what shall I do, or which way shall I shape my course? shall I giue ouer her search, since dreames are so vncertaine? I but this was more then a dreame, it was a vision: for I behelde the Goddesse Venus , who inioyned mee this taske, holding that sweete Lady in her hand: whose forme so perfectly is printed in my remembrance, that I cannot forget the same: which assuredly is liuing and to be found: and therefore I will neuer desist till I haue found her, though I spend the whole race of my life in that quest: which if it were ordained for my endlesse torment, then how should I auoyde the same? neither care I what paine to indure, if I may after all my trauels finde her. In this sort he spent much time, vntill he fell in a deepe studie, leaning his backe to the tree, hee fell fast a sleepe. Whilest hee was in this sweete sleepe, (by happie fortune) Angelica the faire, that day hadde forsaken the Golden Tower, (which was not farre from the place where the knight of Fame lay) to meete the king her father, who with the Queen was comming from the Citie of Ephesus where he kept his Court, to soiourne certain daies for his disport in the golden Tower, that yeelded all kinde of delights, Angelica passing along this pleasant valley, gallantly attended by an vnwoonted traine of Ladies and guard of knights, espied the knight of Fame , supposing that hee had beene dead: to ease which doubt, shee willed one of her knights to see what he was. The knight comming to him, awaked him, who suddainly starting vp, beganne to lay hand on his sword, but casting his eye aside, hee beheld Angelicas gallant traine, and amongst the rest, her selfe, whose countenance hee presently knewe to bee the very Lady hee had seene in the Vision whose beautie and suddaine presence strooke such an amazement to his sences, that he stood like one in a trance. Angelica seeing that hee was aliue, and not dead as she supposed, past on her intended iourney, not regarding him. He seeing her departed, thus said to the knight. Courteous sir, I pray let me craue that gallant Ladies name. Sir (replied he) her name is Angelica , daughter to the most mightie king of Natolia , who passing this way to meete the King and Queene, (who are comming towards the Golden Tower) and seeing you lye vnder this tree, sent me to see whether you were aliue or dead: which said, hee departed. The knight of Fame reioycing that he had seene his long expected Mistresse, was presently rapt into a heauenly conceit of ioy, that hee thought himselfe as it were transformed into pleasure, such comfort reviued his drouping heart from sad dumpes, with her delectable sight, euen then beginning to studie how to come to her speech, or purchase occasion to giue her knowledge of his dutie, finding so many settes and impossibility between him and his intent, that he beganne to dispaire thereof: at last resolued vppon nothing, but determining to doo something, he mounted his steed, and followed that way Angelica went: purposing to take a more precious view of her perfections, being hopelesse of any other comfort. He had soone ouertaken her traine, not yet resolued by reason of his strangenesse, what to do, nor what meanes to vse to speake to her, being incompassed by such a number of Knights: at last he thus thoght with himselfe: I that haue refused the good will of kings daughters, onely to finde this beautifull Ladie, and in her search haue indured so many mischances, shall I now when I see her, be afraid to speake to her? or may I not here after be disappoynted of such fortunate occasion as is now offered me? What though shee bee guarded by these knights, beeing alone; it can no way breede offence to them, that I speake to her? With this resolution he passed by the hindermost of her company without speaking to them, who greatly maruelled what he should be, and comming right against Angelica , who he easily knewe from the rest, by his former little view of her forme in the vision, hee kindly drew neare her, and with a submissive signe of reuerence first giuen, he said as followeth. Most sacred Lay, pardon my boldnesse which I beseech you do not account rudenesse: I haue trauelled many a myle, to attain the heigth of this felictite, to behold your diuine perfections, which maketh mee contrary to that dutifull reuerence my heart hath vowed, to intrude my selfe thus rudely into your presence, being voyde of other meanes to demonstrate my depth of deuotion: therfore I humbly once againe desire your pardon, that haue offended against my will: desiring you withall, to enter into this opinion of my meaning, that (notwithstanding what perswasion my rudenesse may breed in your heauenly hart) it is both loyall, honourable, and vertuous, and no more intending to presume aboue my desert, yet my life shall be alwaies imployed to deserue as well as the best. Angelica hearing his speeches, sadly noting his countenance, and being of a most singular wit, admired his courage, that notwithstanding all her guard, he durst so boldly presume into her presence, which caused her the better to regard both his speeches and proportion, made this reply. Sir Knight, it may be you are deceiued, for you haue not found that which you haue so long sought, which maketh me account your speech flatteries, and your boldnesse folly: entring into no other conceit of your meaning, for be it either good or bad, I care not, for the one cannot harme mee, nor the other pleasure me: but for your good will, I take that kindly, though in my fancie you professe more then you will performe. Diuine Lady (quoth he) vouchsafe but to imploy me, and then shall you make triall of my forwardnesse, which shall be no lesse then I haue promised: for my speech nor bolde approach into your presence, hath not proceeded from want of respect of your woorthinesse, but from a strickt commaund, long since inioyned me to become your dutifull seruant: therefore I humbly beseech you, iudge fauourably of my meaning, for I will rather hereafter consume my heart with silent care, then by my speech purchase your displeasure, if you commaund the cotrary. He had not scarce ended those words, but she let fall her gloue: which he seeing, presently alighted and tooke it vp, with reuerence kissing the same, offered it her againe. Knight (quoth she) take it for your labour, wherewith she turned away from him, for that she espied her father comming: which caused him, being glad of that fauour, to withdraw himselfe. One of Angelicas knights named Camillus to whose principal custodie the king had committed his daughter, aboue all the rest noted the Knight of Fames behauiour, and disdaining that a straunger should carrie away the gloue, which he steemed a fauor far beyond his desert, himselfe hauing bin her seruat a long time, yet could neuer attain any such kindnes: with all, supposing he was some knight Angelica knewe, presently hasted after him, trusting too much to his owne valour, and bluntly badde him render backe the Princesse gloue. Sir (quoth he) againe, the Princesse gaue it me, and for her sake I will keepe the same. Wherewith Collimus without any more words, retired backe to incounter him: and he did the like, and remembring it was the best deede of chiualrie hee could performe in his Ladies presence, thought with himselfe, that if he sate not fast, he would quaile his courage: presently they met each other, the one with brauerie, the other with force, for Collimus measured his length on the ground. By this time the king and Queene had met Angelica , and all greeting ouerpast, their traines met, which almost filled that pleasant valley: in company of Maximus , was Camillus sonne to the king of of Slauonia , attended by a number of gallant knights, who hearing of the exceeding beautie of Angelica , was lately come into the countrie as a suter, to whom Maximus said, (beholding the braue course betweene the two knights,) What knight is yonder, that hath ouerthrowne his aduersarie with such agilitie? A comely knight hee is (quoth Camillus ) but it seemes he is a stranger. With that, another knight of Angelicas attendants, vpon the former quarrell, incountred the knight of Fame , who tasted of his valour, as his predecessor Collimus had done, and after him another, which when Maximus beheld, hee called a Gentleman to him, willing him to request the straunge knight to come and speake with him, which fell out well for the knight of Fames quiet, for had not the king been present, the knights of Angelicas guard had taken such a secret indignation against him, that they by violence would haue sought his death. The messenger Maximus sent, tolde the knight of Fame that the king did request to speake with him. Sir (quoth he) I am readie at his commaund: to whom Maximus said as followeth. Sir knight, you are as it seemeth to me, a stranger in this place, but notwithstanding somewhat bolde with my knights, both whose quarrell against you, and your cause of arriuall, I desire to know. Most renowmed king (quoth he) I am a straunger in this place, or in any else: in my trauels meeting with this gallant troupe, to any of whom I haue as yet giuen no cause of offence, which should make them trouble me. Sir (quoth Maximus ) they haue reapt shame for their discontent: but I pray let vs without offence know your name, & of whence you are: neither feare to disarme your selfe: for vpon my promise, you shall haue no wrong offered you: which said, the knight of Fame pulled off his helmet, making this answere. By name most noble king, I am called the knight of Fame , my birth to my selfe vnknowne, by no ill intent drawne into this countrie, but onely to finde out my Parents, which are likewise vnknowne; my selfe subiect to miserie, by the want of knowledge of my selfe. Marcellus sonne to Maximus , a knight of exceeding courteous and honorable parts, hearing his speeches, humbling himselfe vpon his knee before his father, said. I humbly craue your Maiesties fauour, to entertaine this knight honourably, for that I haue some knowledge of him, which I will declare to your Highnesse hereafter, Maximus hearing his sonnes speeches, said: Rise vp Marcellus , for thy sake, and for his owne too, he shall be welcome: whom do thou vse according as shall seeme good, and bee agreeable to his honourable deserts. The knight of Fame hearing his speeches, most humbly thanked him: and Marcellus presently embraced him, shewing many tokens of hartie good will. Angelica all this while noted euery circumstance of this knights arriuall, as first how she found him a sleepe: and next, of his speeches to her: then how valiantly he had ouerthrowne three knights: then her brothers speeches: and lastly, his gallant youth and comely person: which altogither wrought such a kinde of admiration in her, that shee beganne with a curions eye to marke all his actions: and to affect his company, more then she had done any mans: oftentimes casting a looke vpon him, she perceiued his eye was still vpon her, which made a ruddie blush beautifie her cheekes. In which time, the king intreated him to stay sometime with him, if his important businesse did not withdraw him: which offer he willingly and kindly accepted: which fell out according to his owne hearts content. How the Knight of Fame was entertained at the Golden Tower, and what speeches past betwixt Anna and Angelica . After these speeches past, the King, Camillus , the Queene, Angelica , and all the rest, departed towards the Golden Tower: and by the way, Marcellus beganne to declare in hearing of them all, what he had heard of the knight of Fame : of his valiant exployts in Thrace , and afterwardes how in the Forrest of Arde hee slewe the Gyant Brandamor , which he vttered in such ample manner, and with such commendations, that it made them all admire his noble gifts: especially Angelica aboue all the rest, noted euery circumstance thereof, with such regard, that shee seemed to take great delight therein. The Knight of Fame hearing Marcellus enter into speech of him, drew backe from the hearing thereof, entertaining his Mistresse perfections with such pleasure, and admiring her beautie with such surfetting delight, that he rode like one in a trance, hauing all his sences bent vpon her. By this time they were come to the Golden Tower, where was exceeding preparation made for the King, who speaking to Camillus and the Knight of Fame , tolde them they were most hartily welcome thither: likewise the Queene welcommed them with great kindnesse, epecially Marcellus care for the Knight of Fames entertainment was very great, who caused him to bee lodged in a most stately lodging, where euery thing was readily prepared for him in the best manner. Euery one being departed to their seuerall lodgings, the Knight of Fame meditating on his good fortune, and the kinde entertainment he found in that strange place, waying on the one side, how late hee was plunged in care, and how suddainly he was possest with pleasure, how from miserie, hee was aduanced to the highest of his desired felicitie: how he was lately in dispaire of finding his deuoted, and how prosperously he had now met with her, and had in some part manifested his affectection: how the occasion of his quarrell for his Ladies gloue, was the cause of his kinde entertainment: how fortunately in that straunge place his deedes were extolde: and how kindly Marcellus vsed him, whose acquaintance and friendship might be a meanes both of his stay in that place, and also of obtaining Angelicas loue. Then againe considering how straunge it was, that hee should stay in the very place where his Lady should see him: and how luckily hee had left the Court of the King of Libia , and thereby he was rid from Venolas rash loue, which might both haue indaungered his honour and person: that with the remembrance of all these happy concurrences, his minde was exceedingly contented,  & he seemed to haue attained more happy successe then he would haue wisht: that in that sun-path of sweete delight, accompanied with quiet sleepe, he spent that night. Angelica was likewise no whit inferiour to him in contrarietie of passions, but hauing likewise spent the day in company of her mother, when the time of rest drew nigh, she soone gat from out of all company which shee thought troublesome, being much disquieted in her thoughts, feeling a kinde alteration to her former libertie of mind, being desirous to be alone, shee gat to her chamber: where was none but her damzell Anna , that was her bed-fellow, to whom she said. I pray thee good Anna leaue me alone for a while, for my thoughts are possest with such disquiet, that I desire by solitarinesse to ease my passionate heart. Anna hearing her speeches, maruelling what might be the cause thereof, and being in all respects dutifull, departed. She was no sooner gone, but Angelica sitting downe vpon the rushes, leaning her head vpon the beddes side, beganne to studie whence the occasion of that suddaine alteration she felt in her selfe should proceede: sometimes deeming this, and then that, but still she could not certainly know what to iudge thereof: that her minde was drawne to an extreame torment, which so opprest her sences, that presently she called Anna again: who maruelling at her strange behauiour, & greeuing at her sadnesse, kneeling downe by her, vttered these speeches. My deare Mistresse, I beseech you conceale not from me the occasion of your disquiet, to whose secrecie you neede not feare to commit the same: for I hope you are sufficiently perswaded of my trueth, that do esteeme my dutie to you more dearer then my selfe, which I would most willingly spend for your sake: or if you will vouchsafe to imploy me any way, or in in what sort so euer so it please you to commaund, I will be most willing to vse my vttermost indeuours, as faithfully as euer did seruant, to purchase your content. Ay me wretched creature (quoth Angelica ) it is not mistrust of thy secrecie, nor doubt of thy ayde, nor ought else that I misdoubt in thee, that maketh me withholde any part of my counsell from thee: for if I would shewe it thee, I cannot, for this passion is so newly begunne, that I cannot rightly coniecture what the cause thereof should be, or why my thoughts should be thus suddainly disquieted: and such assured confidence do I retaine in thy fidelitie, that I would conceale no part of my thoughts from thee. Anna hearing her Mistresse speeches, beganne presently to suspect that she had entertained some good conceit of some of the knights that were arriued that day, whom she thought to be the young Prince Camillus : which caused her make this answere. Deare Mistresse (quoth she) I beleeue the approach of some of the gallant knights that came with the king, is the cause of your alteration. Why, (quoth Angelica ) doest thou thinke their approach should disquiet me? Marry (quoth Anna ) because many Ladies haue been suddainly ouertaken with loue: wherewith Angelica blusht, saying. Doest thou thinke my affections so light, to looke of euery one I see? Pardon mee deare Madame (quoth she) I do not thinke so. Wel (quoth Angelica ) suppose thou haste iumpt vpon the right, which of those knights doest thou suppose it is? Wil you pardon me (said Anna ) if I giue my opinion? I will (said she.) I thinke (quoth Anna ) it is the braue Prince Camillus. Camillus (quoth she) it is rather the stranger. Indeed (quoth Anna ) that strange knight farre surmounteth all the knights that euer I beheld, for comelinesse, courtesie, and prowesse. I am assured said Angelica (breathing foorth a sadde sigh) thou speakest this rather to flatter me, then according to that thou thinkest: for otherwise why didst thou speake of Camillus ? Faith Mistresse (quoth she) I named Camillus , not for any thing I see in him comparable with the strange Knight, but for that I would thereby knowe your minde: which now that I vnderstand, if you would follow my counsell, you should not onely like him, but also loue him: for there is no doubt, but the cause of his comming hither, was onely for your sake: who in my rash opinion, will prooue both constant and loyall: for his very countenance bewrayeth the vnited essence of true Nobilitie and vertue to be placed in him. O Anna (quoth she) thou woundest me to the heart: before I had but a suspition of loue, but by thy speeches I begin to be inthralled therein. Do not I pray thee seeke to augment that, which is impossible to come to perfection: which if I should entertaine (as I shall I feare me against my will) thou knowest how many impossibilities do threaten my euerlasting torment thereby: therefore I pray thee do not once name him to mee againe, for if thou doest, I shall bee more inthralled to that very name, then to all the humble sutes of the most noblest knights in the world. Didst thou not heare my brother Marcellus report, how prodigally hee gaue away the kings daughter of Thrace ? and what paines he tooke to redeeme Venola , that beautifull Lady, from Andramarts Castle? I know thou didst: but likewise I know thou didst not heare what he said to me to refell these doubtes, that he was long since inioyned to my seruice, and was the thing hee had long time sought to attaine. Didst thou not see how I found him a sleepe, and yet notwithstanding all the Knights that guarded me, how resolutely (yet with humilitie) hee approached my presence? where hee tolde me, that not want of regard had bredde that rudenesse, but feare of missing that fitte occasion, considering how straightly I am kept and pride into my fathers decree? Didst thou not see how valiantly hee ouerthrew three Knights togither, that would haue taken my gloue from him? Doest thou not see how my brother Marcellus loued him, and all in generall are well affected towardes him? These I thinke are occasions sufficient to refell all suspect of his good intent and meaning. Quoth Anna , Truely Madame, I thinke (all things considered) hee hath not his equall, neither for valour, nor for vertue. You may do as you please, whom I will not so much as once speake of heereafter, since I shall offend you thereby. Yes, I pray thee speake of him (quoth Angelica ) for nothing can please me better, though I feare me nothing will doo mee more harme. And wel maist thou thinke me ouerfond, so soon to be intangled in the bondes of loue, with a straunger, that I neither knewe of whence, nor what he is: of whom we haue said I ynough at this time, therfore I pray let vs deferre any further commendation of him, vntill we haue made better proofe of his woorthinesse: which said, they betooke themselues to their rest. Early the next morning the knight of Fame was vppe, to whom Marcellus was soone gotten, who tooke no other delight, but onely in his company, vsing him so kindly and so honourably, that the knight of Fame maruelled thereat, wondring whence such kindnesse should grow: that he likewise beganne greatly to affect his company, and being both come into the kings presence, who was accompanied by Camillus , they spent the forenoone in seuerall discourses: likewise Angelica spent her time, amongst the Ladies of great account, in such sort as agreed in their fancie. Dinner time being come, a most costly and sumptuous feast was prepared: wherevnto Maximus inuited all his Nobles, and Camillus and the Knight of Fame amongst the rest as his chiefest, where they were most honurably entertained, sumptuously feasted, and kindly welcommed. Camillus seeing that the Queene and Angelica were wanting, was suddainly fallen into a sadde dumpe, because the Lady of his delight was absent: which the King noted more specially then all the rest, who supposing that Camillus came as a suter to his daughter, had of purpose giuen order to the Queene, that she should banquet the Ladies by themselues: which was so done, that neither Camillus nor any else perceiued his drift therein, which made Camillus extream angrie with himselfe, that he had not the day before (when he inioyed both her sight and full libertie of speech) in some measure giuen her knowledge of his loue. The Knight of Fame on the contrary side, gouerned himselfe with more moderation, for he hauing attained such good successe as his hart did wish, was therewith for the present contented: hoping that fortune that had beene so fauourable to him, would not suddainly alter her countenance, but still continue her ayde to his furtherance: whom Maximus likewise diligently noted, hauing suspition that hee likewise came for Angelicas loue, though hee dissembled the contrary, of which he could perceiue no likelihood by his merrie countenance, which caused him onely to suspect Camillus and not him. The feast being ended with great royaltie, eueryone after some Courtly pastime past, be tooke themselues to what exercise liked them best. Camillus still accompanied the King, shewing (for greefe of Angelicas absence) such a kinde of behauiour, as though his sences were bewitched with carelesse passions, which he noted diligently, therby breeding in his minde, an assurance of his suspition. The Knight of Fame had withdrawn himselfe into a garden, and seeking the solitariest place he could finde, began to recall the sweete remembrance of Angelicas bewtie into his minde, wherevnto hee was more firmely inthralled, then he was before he had seene her, though euen then his loue was firme, hauing but seene her in a Uision, that he was now not onely contented with that fauour shee had already shewen him, but also deuised and studied how to become more gracious in her sight, and attaine some better hope of her loue, which as yet hee had not likelihood to attaine. Whilest he was in the depth of these cogitations, Marcellus missing him, and seeing him before enter into the garden, neuer left vntill he had found him out, to whom he said. Syr Knight, I am somewhat bolde to interrupt your quiet meditations by my approach, beeing desirous of your company: therefore if I may without intrusion accompany you, I will stay, otherwise I would be loth to breede your disquiet. Most noble Marcellus (quoth the Knight of Fame ) I am not troubled with your presence, but thinke my selfe most happie to enioy the same, as farre vnworthie such kindnesse: being a stranger here, thinke my selfe so highly honoured by your fauour, that I shall account my selfe for euer bound vnto you for the same: thinking my selfe more happie thereby then I could haue wisht, being before subiect to all euill fortune, account my selfe exceedingly fortunate by your kindnesse and friendship. I would it were in my power (quoth Marcellus ) to deserue so well of you: beeing more willinger then able to pleasure you, for the report of your honourable gifts, hath made me long since desirous of your acquaintance, that if you please to stay with me in my fathers Court, I will labour to shewe my good will towards you: and if you will accept of my plaine meaning, without further tryall, I will hereafter prooue your faithfull friend. Most courteous knight (quoth hee) I can yeelde no other recompence but hartie thankes for your kindenesse, which hath extended it selfe farre beyond my desert, with so willing a heart accepting your kinde proffers, that before I prooue disloyall, I will teare my heart from out my brest. Then (quoth Marcellus ) lette vs conclude this suddaine consent of good will, which for my parte, shall neuer while life doth last bee dissolued. Desiring you henceforwards to make such account of mee, that wherein soeuer I may in any degree pleasure you, I will as assuredly doo my best, as in my power consisteth. With that they embraced each other: betwixt whom, such good will began to growe, as was both constant and indissoluable. How Angelica was imprisoned: and how Maximus rebuked his son, for suffering the knight of Fame to speake to Angelica . accompany him into the Court to visit the Ladies, who (quoth he) are this day feasting by themselues. The knight of Fame glad thereof willingly gaue his consent, being the onely thing that contented his minde: and being come into the presence where the Queene was, and hauing done his reuerence, shee most kindly welcommed the Knight of Fame , telling Marcellus , that his comming was to see the young Ladies: whereat Marcellus smiling, departed into a gallery, where were a multitude of sweet bewties, exercising themselues at seuerall pastimes, some at Chesse, some at Cardes, and some in pleasant communication, whom Marcellus kindly imbraced: but the knight of Fame by reason he was a straunger, was not so bolde, but hauing his minde dedicated to serue no other Saint but Angelica , looked for her, whom he espied at the further end of the Gallery in a heauie dumpe, leaning vpon her elbowe: who hearing Marcellus voyce, looked backe, and cast her eye first on the knight of Fame , on whom she fastned a stedfast eye a good space: but remembering her selfe, with an exceeding blush, she withdrew the same, because she sawe his eye setled on her. Marcellus by this time came towards Angelica , and perceiuing her blushing countenance, caused him to note how melancholly shee was alone, saying: how now sister, what sollitarie studie is that which hath withdrawne you from yonder pleasant company? My mind (quoth she) is better exercised, by beeing sometimes alone, then in their company: but since your presence hath broken my meditation, I can be well content to forsake the same to enioy your company, which me thinkes is very rare. I thanke you good sister (quoth he) assuring you, that I take it wondrous kindely, that you thinke so well of me, which hereafter you shall at your commaund enioy: withall, I desire you for my sake to bid this Knight welcome, whom I esteeme as dearely as my selfe: with that Angelica turned towards him, & hee with humble reuerence, kissed her hand, to whom Angelica said: Syr, by my brothers command I bid you welcome: the Knight of Fame most humbly thanked her, being so exceedingly rauished in his minde with ioy, that no ioy might be compared to that he endured. Angelica on the other side was euery way affected with as sweet content, by that opportunitie to take a more precise view of his comelinesse, entertaining the same with such surffetting delight, that shee not onely augmented the heate of her former affection, but also was now fettered in the indissolueable bands of loue. Marcellus and she continued sometime in conference togither, in which time Angelica cast many a sweete looke towards the knight of Fame , which hee well perceiued, by reason his eye was neuer off her, which shee likewise noting, striued not to shewe the like kindnesse againe, but notwithstanding, contrary to her purpose, her hearts inward affection, constrained her to behold him, which made her colour go and come exceedingly: oftentimes breaking off her speeches with such passionate studies, & sometimes breathing a silent sigh which Marcellus noted, but yet seemed not to marke. In the meane time, in comes the Queene, who calling Marcellus vnto her, entred into comunication with him, which when Angelica beheld, her heart began to throb & pant with a kind of delight: ye knight of Fame likewise was tormented with such diuersitie of passion, being desirous to speake to Angelica , yet not daring to attempt such boldnesse in presence of ye Queen, hauing before heard of Maximus decree Whilest he was in thus cogitatio, Anna seeing her Mi. alone, & the knight she so dearly loued hard by her, came & vsed some speeches vnto her on him, which he well noted, at last the Queene departed again, and Marcellus went to sport amongst the rest of the Ladies, hauing before noted his sisters passions, which he was in some suspicion, was by reason of the knight of Fames being there. The Knight of Fame seeing the Queene departed, and Marcellus amongst the Ladies, not rashly attempting such boldnesse, but with a most submisse and comelie behauiour, drew towards Angelica (beeing surprised with such a feare to offend) and care what to say, that his hart shooke therewith) and humblie kissing her hand, with a trembling feare he still held the same in his palm, and said: My diuine Lady pardon my presumptio, that ouerboldly & contrary to my desert, presume to trouble your sacred eares with my speeches: which if I did suppose would bee offensiue, I would burie still in the closet of my troubled heart, from whence they proceeded: but if I may be so gracious in your sight, as to gain the sweet opportunitie by your fauourable license, as to declare the depth of my deuotion, & how and in what sort, & how long since I was enioyned to become your deuoted seruant, I shall rest so much more inthralled to your vertues, as my poore heart shall for euer be vnable to yeelde sufficient thankes for: which I dare not presume to doo without your fauourable consent, which I desire you to grant. Angelica all this while stood as one transformed into bashfulnesse, being possest with delight, yet vnwilling to make any shew therof, which caused an exceeding blush beautifie her cheeks, which added some splendure to perfect bewtie it selfe, which at all times appeared most liuely in her sweete countenance: at last withdrawing her hand, which now began to sweate with his strickt embrace, which he was vnwilling to let goe, yet fearefull to hold without her cosent, to whom she made this answer: Sir, where no harme is ment, there needeth no such intreatance for pardon, for the actuall offence I see none, but if any be intended, it is more then I know, and therefore without my power to forgiue: neither doth your speech neither please nor offend me, but if spoken with good meaning, I cannot blame, nor will deny to heare another time: withall, wishing you not to thinke me tractable to euery perswasion, but haue yeelded you that fauour, neuer yet any had at my hands: which peraduenture imboldneth you to vse your accustomed maner of flatteries, wherunto most me are addicted, wherein you shall doo greatly amisse: for though I condiscend to heare you, yet do not thinke my minde easily drawne to beleeue euery protestation. Most vertuous Lady (quoth he) neither do my words proceed fro custome, but my speeches proceed from the depth of my true and humble heart, that hath vowed neuer to start from the constant veritie, which hath long nursed many bitter torments, proceeded by desire to find your vertuous selfe; which hath bin the cause of my long trauell. Then I most humbly beseech you, esteeme of me as one that can breath no longer then he is in your fauour. For sooner shall all things be dissolued, then I faile in dutie to your seruice, and constancie to continue deuoted to your commaund: which if I may bee in any hope to attaine, though it be with the extreame hazard that euer knight indured, I shal account my selfe the most happiest man liuing. Therefore I beseech you, let no suspected conceit of my truth, withdrawe your vertues from pittying mee: for without the fruition of your sweete fauour, it is impossible for me to liue. Beseeching your excellencie likewise, not to suppose my words to proceede from fained affection, but from a heart that hath vowed to be perpetually constant, and will neuer start fro truth, whatsoeuer miseries or crosses may happen to trie my constancie. Angelica hearing his speeches, withall, noting with what motions and alterations his heart was oppressed, by the oft chaunge of his countenance, and withall, being her selfe euery way as much inthralled to loue as himselfe, hoping that his heart, if it harboured true loyaltie, would not deeme amisse of his courtesie, (for the noblest minds are soonest drawne to pittie) gaue him this kinde reply. Sir knight, your earnest speeches hath so much preuailed with mee, that gladly I would shewe you what kindnesse resteth in me, but that I still feare to bee deceiued: therefore if heereafter I see you constant, make no doubt but I will bee so kinde as you can wish, and yeeld you what recompence I can, in requitall of your good will: withall, wishing you to thinke that my heart hath yeelded you that fauour, which yet neuer any had from me. Angelica had not ended those words, but in comes Maximus puffing with vexation, to whom Collimus had declared, that the Knight of Fame was some disguised counterfeit, that came to seeke Angelicas loue, whereon his life depended) and comming to him, seeing him in talke with his daughter, said, Knight (quoth hee) what maketh thee thus bolde, so farre to presume aboue thy desert, to intrude thyselfe into my daughters company, which thou knowest is contrary to my decree. Then taking Angelica by the arme, hee thrust her from him, commaunding Collimus (who was readie at hand) to commit her to safe custodie: and vpon paine of death, not to suffer any, not so much as his sonne Marcellus to come to her speech: by whose meanes Collimus had tolde him, the knight of Fame was brought into her company. Collimus hauing this charge, which was his owne seeking, immediately conueyed Angelica from their presence, who notwithstanding her fathers presence and displeasure: turned backe and gaue the knight of Fame a kinde looke at her departure, which he well noted, and therewith conceiued more ioy, then he took greefe at Maximus vnkindnesse. By this time Marcellus was come to his father, who cast such a displeasant countenance vpon him, as that hee well perceiued hee was someway incenst against him: wherewith the King in a great rage departed, not speaking a word to him. After hee was gone, Marcellus comming to the knight of Fame (whose heart was nipt with greef) and noting his sad countenance, departed with him down into the garden: where being come, Marcellus said as followeth. Deare friend (quoth he) for by other name I will neuer call you, be not disquieted with my fathers displeasure, who giueth too much credite to vntrue reports: and that causeth him both to be offended with any that speaketh to my sister, and also suspitious of all that come into his owne company, wherby he dishonoureth his owne name, liueth a troublesome life, and also keepeth her as it were in prison, which I am sure can breed no litle care in her brest, whose hard hap I much pittie, and would any way ease if it lay in my power. Most honourable knight (quoth he) I am most hartily sorrie, that my ouerboldnesse hath caused your fathers displeasure, that diuine Ladies disquiet, which is more greeuous vnto me then death: which it was my accursed misfortune to procure, being drawn to that presumption by attractiue beautie: wishing that I had someway ended this my accursed life, before my approach in this place, that therby I might not haue beene so vnfortunate, as to be a meanes of her care, and your disquiet: for that I see the King is likewise displeased with you. As for that take no care (quoth Marcellus ) nor be so much greeued for my sister, for these troubles will be soone calmed: which to effect, let me alone. In the mean time, (whatsoeuer inward thoughts you conceiue) yet smother your discontent, and shew your selfe chearefull as heeretofore you haue bin: for I perceiue that some of enuie hath incensed my father, the truth whereof I will soone find out. Marcellus hauing ended these speeches, left the Knight of Fame walking in the garden, and presently without any shew or signe of discontent, went into the presence, where he found the King in company of Camillus , according to his woonted manner doing his reuerence, and taking his vsuall place. The King maruelling how he durst so boldly presume into his presence, without reconcilement, thoght that either want of dutie had procured the same, or else he did not perceiue he was displeased with him: to ease himselfe of which doubt, he said as followeth. Marcellus , I had thought your care would haue beene greater to regard my good, then any mans else, considering you know the depth of my secrets: as concerning Angelica , on whose beautie my life doth depend, and not so negligently and disobediently, not onely to suffer that straunge Knight to proffer loue to her, but also to bee a meanes to bring him into her sight, and helpe him to her speech, wherein you haue shewen your selfe vndutifull, which maketh me rather to suspect you as one readie to seeke my life, then carefull to preserue the same. My Lord and father (replyed Marcellus ) I trust your Maiestie do conceiue no such thought of me, which haue in no degree deserued the same: much lesse euer in thought disagreed in the least poynt of dutie to your decree: besides my Lord, I do assuredly beleeue, you are misinformed of the straunge knights meaning, whose intent is both honourable, and from the least thought of loue to my sister: but there are some in credit with your Highnesse, who disquiet you too much with their flatteries, and will rather reioyce to see all things fall out according to their reports, then be any way sorrie to see the same: whose speeches and false informations, I trust shall not alter your good opinion of my loyaltie: whose constant loue, dutie, and obedience, shall continue firme, when their treacheries shall be reuealed, and they found traitors: therefore I beseech your Highnesse, both alter your coceiued displeasure against me, and the Knight of Fame , of whom so honourable report hath bin spred in most places, for it will be accounted an act of great discourtesie, to vse him vnkindly. Maximus hearing his sonnes speeches, in accusation of them he most fauoured, and in defence of the Knight of Fame , against whom he was mightily incenst, was turned into such collor, that he gaue him this rebuke. Darest thou both enuiously accuse my friends, and disloyally plead for my enemie, hencefoorth presume no more into my sight, without my licence, for I will rather esteeme thee as a priuie enemie, then as my naturall sonne. Which when he had said turning a side, Marcellus departed, maruelling who it should bee that had incensed the King against him, being so inwardly greeued in his minde, that he thought to leaue no means vnassaied to learne the truth thereof. Angelica as before is said, being conueyed by Collimus to safe custodie, beganne to conceiue such sorrow for her fathers displeasure taken against the Knight of Fame , vnto whom she beganne to beare an exceeding loue: such effect had his perswasiue speeches wrought in her gentle heart) that she entred into exceeding sorrowes, coniecturing diuersly what disquiet that discontent might breede by reason of her fathers iealous suspect alreadie begunne: and how the Knight of Fame might be abused in that straunge place, hauing no friend to take his part, which thought strooke a suddaine pensiuenesse to her heart. Contrarily, she thought that would be a meanes to trie his loyaltie, which somewhat would haue eased her heart, so that no other daunger would haue ensued thereon. At last, hauing no other meanes of comfort, (nor friend to impart her minde vnto) she called Anna vnto her, and willed her to learne how the Knight of Fame had ouerpast her fathers displeasure: but so discreetly, that none might perceiue the same: who presently went about the businesse Angelica had enioyned her. Thus will we leaue them all in diuers cogitations. How the Knight of Libia hearing that the Knight of Fame was in Natolia , by Flauias false accusation, sent messengers to Maximus , to intreate him to put him to death. How Maximus threw him into the Lyons denne. After that the Knight of Fame was departed from Libia , and Venola had knowledge thereof by Flauia , she continued many daies in great sorrow, but afterwards by tract of time calming her greefe, but no whit her affection, by Flauias perswasions, who was priuie to all her actions, turned her former good will that was grounded vpon vertue, to lust and mad desire: that seeing she could not by faire meanes winne him to her loue, she thought to leaue no meanes vnassayed, either by force to compell him thereto, or else in some measure to be reuenged on him for his discourtesie. The minde beeing alwaies readie by euery perswasion, to yeelde to worke any meanes for to procure desired content: euen so she casting about many deuises with Flauia , one day finding fit opportunitie when the King was in his dumps, for Venolas sicknesse) came vnto him, and tolde him that the cause of his daughters sicknesse, was procured by an exceeding flight shee had taken by the discourteous vsage of the Knight of Fame , who for that cause was lately fledde from the Court, which vntill that day she had concealed from her, neither should she euer recouer her selfe, vntill she were in some hope to be reuenged of him. The King willed her to declare the same vnto him. Flauia then beganne as followeth. My Lord, this Knight presuming often into my Mistresse presence, by reason of the kindnesse she shewed him, for working her release in Brandamors Castle, (which he well deserued) beganne oftentimes to make loue to her, whom she answered in good sort, being vnwilling to make choise of any, but by your appoyntment: but in the end, his sutes grew to that importunacie, that he wold haue no deniall, but comming into her chamber, chusing his fittest opportunitie, when my Mistresse was in her bedde, and surprising her vnawares, offered her exceeding shame and villanie, but being by her striuing and outcrie disappoynted of his full intent, hee presently fledde away. The King hearing Flauias speece s, was exceedingly inraged with furie, commaunding his Knights to post euery way, to learne where he made his abode. This newes being spredde, at last came to a knight of Natolia , who by occasion was then in the Libian Court, who presently came to the king, and tolde him that hee needed not to make inquirie for the Knight of Fame , for that he was at the Golden Tower. The King hearing that newes, was exceedingly glad thereof, commaunding his Knights to stay their iourney, writing a letter to Maximus , to this effect. behalfe vpon a traitor, who now remaineth with you, who hath dishonoured my daughter: he is called the knight of Fame : assuming that name to colour his wicked practises, who no doubt will soone deuise some mischiefe against your person: let him not escape your hands, but rather send him to me, that I may reuenge that monstrous iniurie he hath done me, by his life: which onely shall satisfie me. Thus remembring my loue to you, and desiring your secrece, I cease. Your brother of Libia . Hauing written this letter, and sealed it with his signet, hee presently sent the same by certaine of his knights to the Golden Tower, who as effectually dispatched their iourney, as hee had giuen them straight charge: and arriuing at the Golden Tower, deliuered the letter to Maximus , who hauing redde the same, and well considered the circumstance, which augmented his hatred and suspition alreadie begunne against the knight of Fame , presently coming to the place wher he was in talke with Marcellus , he caused him to be apprehended, and without any other iudgement, caused him presently to bee cast into a denne of Lyons, to be deuoured. The knight of Fame was no sooner put into the denne, but the Lyons made an exceeding roaring, that those without assuredly iudged him deuoured, and himselfe expected nothing but that terrible and fearefull death: but the Lyons, who by nature will not harme those of royall blood, spared his life, and not so much as offered to touch him, but were rather terrified with his presence. He being glad of this happy escape, beganne to assure himselfe, that he was sprung of kingly race, which greatly comforted his heart, and added a perswasiue hope to comfort himselfe withall, that by that occasion hee should attaine Angelicas loue, if he could worke meanes for his releasement out of that place: most of all, he wondred why Maximus had offered him that outrage. In these and such like cogitations he spent the rest of the day. Marcellus seeing the knight whom he most dearely loued destroyed, without iudgement, equitie, or cause, was so inwardly inraged, that he was in minde oftentimes to worke himselfe iniurie, and seeke meanes of reuenge, if he knewe who had beene the causer thereof: and not knowing what to do, nor in whose company to spend his time, he presently thought to go to Angelica , whom he thought bare some good will to the knight of Fame , with her to bemone his vntimely death: but comming to the place where she was, hee would haue entred therein, but Collimus according to Maximus commaund denied him, and that the more obstinately, for that he knewe none fauoured the knight of Fame so much as he, whom he mortally hated. Marcellus being before sufficiently inraged, was now so much more vexed, that hee drewe his dagger, and with a violent blowe stabbed the same to Collimus heart: and withal, going to Angelica , he found her very sad, litle thinking of these mischances, who seeing him in that rage, which she soone perceiued by his behauiour, shee came vnto him, (hauing seated himselfe downe in a chaire) and desired ta knowe the cause of his wrath. O sister (quoth he) this place is the harbour of crueltie, tyranny, and dishonour, which in times past hath beene famous, and a receipt of honour, but shortly wil be hated and shunned, as odious & omniminious, and all procured by the foolish diuining of a wicked Harlot, that hath filled my fathers head with such fansies, that hee forgetteth himselfe, his honour, and kingly behauiour, and giueth credit to none but flatterers and parisides, imprisoning his children, murthering his frends, and seeking the subuersion of honour and honourable knights Oh Angelica , what should I say, or to whom should I complaine? hee hath slaine vertue, he hath destroyed honour, he hath murthered my deare friend, that kinde and courteous knight: hee hath cast the vnknowne, (most honorable thogh vnknown) Knight of Fame , into the Lyons de: without iudgement, iustice, right, offence, or triall. Angelica hearing his words, was readie to sound with greefe, but that feare to discouer her loue withheld her: but being not able to refraine from teares, shee withdrew her selfe aside to conceale the same, which Marcellus espying, caught her in his armes, and said. Nay deare sister, do not conceale your greefe for his death from me, that loue you so much the better: and if you euer conceiued any good liking of him, I shall honour you for the same: for he was worthie to bee beloued of the best Lady in the world: for in him shined all partes and poynts of true Knighthood and honour. I cannot (quoth Angelica ) deny, but that I liked and loued him too: neither shall I euer do otherwise whilest I liue, though he knewe not so much: for whose death, my heart shall neuer harbour quiet, nor neuer shall thought of other loue sinke into my brest: for him had I vowed to loue, and that vowe will I keepe inuiolable, whilst life doth last. Oh Angelica (quoth Marcellus ) had I knowne you had loued him so well, I would haue died with him, but I would haue saued his life, which was so suddainly acted, & so vnexpected, that before I could recouer my sences from amazement, he was past my reach. What cause had my father thinke you, to seeke his destruction, but because he sawe him in speech with you? Ay me (quoth Angelica ) was I the cause of his death, I will then go to him: with that, such greefe opprest her heart, that she fell downe in his armes. Marcellus called to her maides, who presently came thronging about her, maruelling at her suddaine sicknesse: and especially Anna , who was priuie to her thoughts, & hearing Marcellus speeches, made great lamentation. This newes was soone come to the Queens hearing, who presently came running vnto the place, and hauing by her labour recouered her, entred into these speeches. Why how now Angelica , what meanest thou to do thy self this wrong? What mischance or suddaine passion hath caused this disquiet? Then turning to Marcellus , Or can you tell Marcellus (quoth she) for you were by? I know not (quoth he) but I am sure we haue all little cause of ioy, when wee that are the Kings children, shall be imprisoned vpon the flattering report of euery dissembling Sicophant. Why (quoth she) who hath abased you? That did Collimus (qo he) & him I haue rewarded. Besides, my Lord and father hath destroyed that honourable straunge knight, because I loued him, who neuer deserued the least cause of such crueltie, but was alwaies honourably esteemed in euery Kings Court, vntill it was his ill happe to arriue in this vnfortunate place, to ende his life by tyrannie, not by iustice. Take heed Marcellus , schandalize not your fathers honour, which may bring you in daunger: for that he hath done nothing but right, and with good consideration, for beholde that letter, and thou shalt soone see what a counterfeit that Knight of Fame was. Marcellus hauing redde the letter, was at the first suddainly amazed thereat, but yet notwithstanding, he said: vpon my life this accusation is most false and vntrue. Angelica taking the letter, and reading the same, was exceedingly astonished thereat, to whom Marcellus said. Angelica beleeue it not, for if you do, you shall too much wrong that honourable knight, that is too much abused alreadie, who if hee were liuing, would soone prooue these accusations false: but hee good Knight is now dead, and past recalling, whose death will bring more dishonour to the Natolians , then euer will be recouered. Why (quoth the Queene) what maketh thee Marcellus so inconsiderate, by taking a strangers part, to indaunger thy owne life, which knowest the kings humour? Loue (quoth hee) to that straunger, maketh me bewaile his vntimely death, whom I would that I had excused. The Queene seeing Angelica somewhat well recouered, departed vnto Maximus , who by that time had knowledge of Collimus death, & was meditating how to chastise Marc . for that presumption: But the Queen vpon her knees intreated him to pardon him, alleaging that Collimus had greatly abused him: with much adoo the King was pacified. Marcellus hauing somewhat comforted Angelica , in a heauie and sad estate, departed to his chamber, and left her with her Damozell Anna , rather ready to yeelde vp the Ghoast, then otherwise likelie to suruiue: and night being come, she refusing meat, went to her bedde, not to sleepe, but to bewaile the knight of Fames vntimely death. The Knight of Fame all this time remained in the Lyons den, carefully deuising which way to get out of that place, tyring his sences, but finding no meanes of release. One while accusing his hard fortune, and then Maximus for his crueltie. Sometimes fearing to be famished in that place: and then comforting himselfe with perswasions of impossible deliueries. Now dispairing to be vtterly exempt from the sweete sight of Angelica , whose absence and restraint of libertie procured as hee thought by his boldnesse) pinched his heart with extreame torture. In this sort he continued so long, vntil that he was ready to be starued, and constrained to eate such vnsauerie foode as was daylie cast to the Lyons. Angelica likewise no whit mittigated her greefe, but rather augmeted the same: being much comforted by Marcellus , whose mind was not yet satisfied with sufficient consideration of these mischances, but both hee and Angelica continued as it were in a further hope in their fancies, of the knight of Fames safetie: though when they began to comfort themselues with any perswasions, they were quite past hope. Maximus likewise hauing considered with what seueritie he had vsed the Knight, & that he had condemned him without any triall of the accusation that had bene vsed by his knights, euer since his death, began to tell a remorse in his conscience of vniustice) but by the setled opinion that was stirred in his heart by those false prophesies, hee soone shooke the same off. Camillus all this time likewise noted what iealous suspition the king heard of him, and hauing heard the report why he kept his daughter so stronglie guarded, and of set purpose withheld her from his sight, and noting how suddainly the Knight of Fame was made away without any cause of offence giuen, he began to feare himselfe, and by that meanes, durst not shew any signe of desire to see Angelica , least by that meanes he should seeke some occasion of quarrell with him, and vse him like the stranger: within a while departed from the Golden Tower, intending notwithstanding, either with force, or faire meanes, to attaine her possession. Of the knight of Fames preseruation. How he gat out of the den, and and departed the Tower. The next day after Camillus departure, which Maximus perceiued was with a discontented mind, the keeper of the Lyons denne, came to make cleane the same, and vsed his woonted manner, which was, to set open those places that were cleane, into which, the Lyons would soone enter, and hauing fast bolted the doores, and being owner of the Lyons, entered into the den, where the Knight of Fame was, who suddainly caught hold on him, (hauing before secretly shrowded himselfe from his sight) and being carefull to prouide for his owne safetie, snatcht from his side a hanging sword: the keeper knowing him, maruailing to see him aliue, and exceedingly astonished at his sight, held vp his hands for mercie, to whom the knight of Fame said. My friend, I seeke not thy life, but mine owne safetie, being as thou seeest preserued by diuine prouidence, from the kings crueltie, by him vniustly cast into this place, without any cause of offence: but wrongfully, as thou mayest perceiue by my preseruation: for if my fact had deserued punishment, no doubt I could not haue escaped the crueltie of these execusioners, hauing endured great danger of famishment. Now my request vnto thee is, that thou wouldest but suffer me to depart from hence, without discrying mee, for I haue no reason to trust to Maximus curtesie, hauing alreadie endured this miserie by his crueltie: which thou mayest well doo, without endaungering thy selfe any kinde of way: for there is none but doth assuredly thinke I am dead. The keeper hearing his speeches, and withall seeing how admirably he was preserued, and also fearing his owne death, assured him by many vowes and protestations, not onely to do that which hee had desired, but also would most faithfully execute what other thing soeuer he should command, to his vttermost power. Wilt thou then (quoth he) do this for me? giue me the keyes, and make fast the doore, so that thou canst not goe from me, and then call downe thy boye and send him to Marcellus , to request him to come to thee, but in such sort, that the boy may not see me, and also to do his message secretly: which the keeper tolde him, he would most willingly performe. Then directing the Knight of Fame how to locke the doore, that he could not escape, he called downe his boy, who presently came to him, whom he commanded to seeke out Marcellus secretly, and to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to come and speake with him, about a matter of great importance. The boy hauing receiued his message, immediately hasted to execute the same: and most fortunately met him in the outer court, to whom he declared the cause of his comming. Marcellus maruelling why the keeper had sent for him, presently began to remeber the knight of Fame , with which his heart began to throb: but hasting downe to the den, the keeper comanded his boy to depart: and humbling himselfe to Marcellus , told him that the Knight of Fame was still liuing. Which said, he ran in vnto him (who had shrowded himselfe from his sight) and tolde him Marcellus was come: then presently hee came forth, whom Marcellus espying, with great reioycing, caught him in his armes, and most louingly embraced him, seeming to bee reuiued with ioy, in respect of the care opprest his minde before hee hadde knowledge of his safetie. Many courteous greetings past on either side, Marcellus desired the keeper not to reueale this secret to any: for if it should come to my fathers hearing, it were impossible then to preuent his rigour: and withall promised him, that if he would let him lodge in his house but that night, he would reward him most bountifully: and withal promised him to higher dignitie, and to such place of account, as that he should haue good cause to reioyce, that euer the Knight of Fame came within his house. The keeper both drawne by his owne good inclination, and also by the hope of reward and preferment, beeing but poore, promised his vttermost ayde and assistance to pleasure him, and withall, to performe his full desire, with such securitie, that none should conceiue any suspition thereof: with that they all togither departed vp into his lodge, where the Knight of Fame refreshed himselfe with comfortable meates, being exceedingly glad (as hee had good cause) of this successe: and rendring many thankes to Marcellus (who well deserued the same.) Marcellus being yet somewhat troubled in his mind about the Letter the King of Libia had sent, and desirous to be satisfied of the truth therin, taking the Knight of Fame aside, from the hearing of the keeper, said as followeth. Sir Knight, although I haue shewen you this fauour and friendship, which my fancie often perswaded mee to refuse, yet vrged by the good will I beare you, and for other considerations which I will yet conceale from you, I could not chuse but reioyce at your safetie, and worke what meanes I can for your preseruation: yet there remaineth a grudging in my conscience against you, vntill you assure me by your faithfull oath, to satisfie me of the truth of my doubt without fraude: for if that be true which is alleaged against you, by the affirmation of a King, you deserue the punishment my father inflicted vpon you, and rather to be generally hated, then beloued at all. Most honourable knight (quoth he) I know my selfe so cleare from all such villaine, as that I sweare, and protest by my life, by heauen, and by all the good that euer I expect, which I desire to turne to my destruction, if I tell you not the very truth. Then (quoth Marcellus ) the same day that the King my father caused you to be throwne into the Lions den, the King of Libia sent hither certaine of his Knights, with a Letter, wherein hee accused you to haue most shamefully dishonoured his daughter Venola , desiring my father to dispatch you out of the way: for your life & nothing else might appease his ire: which was the cause of his crueltie. My Lord (quoth the Knight of Fame ) vpon mine honour, my former oath, and by all other truth and fidelitie, this accusation is most vniust, false and vntrue: which if I may by your fauor (in whose hands life now resteth) haue libertie to approoue, I will maintaine the contrary, euen in the gates of the King of Libia , and cause my accusers to confesse the contrary: neither did I euer seeke loue at that Ladies hands, by whose dishonourable meanes this accusation is raised against mee. Deare friend (quoth Marcellus ) you haue said inough, and I rest assuredly satisfied of your loyaltie. The knight of Fame was somwardly vexed with this accusation, that he was halfe madde with greefe, but chiefly for that he thought it was come to Angelicas hearing, & might be a meanes to cause her vtterly to forsake him: which appalled his sences with extreame vexation, that he stood like one transformed. Marcellus perceiuing his discontent, desired him not to bee greeued but to ouerpasse the same, vntill he had meanes to prooue the contrarie. My Lord (replyed he) how can I chuse but be sorry, when thereby I am dishonoured in euery mans opinion, which I account more dearer then my life? Besides, with what impatiencie may I shew my selfe before any Knight liuing, but rather rid my hated selfe out of this miserable life, which is the next way to salue this blemish? But if you will voucsafe to heare the true report of the miseries I haue indured euer since my birth, you would say that I am the onely mappe of sorrow, and borne to perpetuall calamitie. I desire nothing more (quoth Marcellus ) with that he rehearsed to him all that hee could, of his bringing vp in the Iland of Rockes , his departure from thence, and shipwracke at sea: how he was entertained by D. Amasenus in Thrace , and the treacherie was intended against him there, by Corus and Argalus : then of his successe in the Kings Court of Thrace , and the occasion why he departed from thence to the Forrest of Arde : and how there he met the Prince of Bohemia , and released Venola : then how Venola sought his loue, and how she gaue him (by subtiltie) a somniferous potion, to withholde his departure with Parismus , which hee purposed: and how afterwards perceiuing her intent, departed from thence. Withall, hee declared the manner of the vision that appeared vnto him in Thrace , and how that he was thereby inioyned to seeke out the Lady that appeared to him, and sue for her loue, which was the cause that he both refused Phylenas marriage, and Venolas proffer of kindnesse: and also he declared how hee first arriued in that countrie, and met Angelica , which was the very same Lady that appeared vnto him in the vision: and also tolde him, that he was likewise inioyned to seeke out his Parents, which the vision told him were of great birth. This (quoth he) is the true discourse of my forepassed life, which I neuer yet manifested to any but your selfe, whose fauour hath farre surmounted my desert, into whose hands I commit my life to be disposed of: desiring you not to conceiue amisse of me, for that false accusation, being most vntrue. Marcellus againe embracing him in his armes, desired him likewise, not to thinke that he did any way conceiue the least euill opinion of him, but that he did esteeme of him, as of the dearest friend he had in the world, and that he did both loue and honour him as himselfe, and would neuer forsake him whilest he liued, but continue his faithfull friend for euer. Hauing in this sort made a new league of amitie, Marcellus left the Knight of Fame to his priuate meditations, promising to returne to him very shortly, going directly to Angelica , whom hee found continuing her woonted sadnesse, for she could by no meanes bee comforted, but still augmented her loue, by remembring the knight of Fames person, to whom she bare such intire affection, that she resolued neuer to loue any other Knight, but determined to spende the whole date of her life in single estate. Marcellus suddaine approach brake off her silent pensiuenesse, by his countenance shewing a heart replenisht with ioy, which he vttered in this sort. Angelica (quoth he) cast off this sadde countenance, for I bring you news of more comfort, for the knight of Fame is liuing, and preserued by admirable meanes. Oh brother (quoth she) this newes cannon be true, which will nip my heart with greefe to heare of, and be disappoynted therein. Sister (quoth hee) it is so, neither maruell thereat, for his innocencie in the fact laid to his charge, hath I thinke caused the Gods to pittie him: besides, thereby you may bee assured, he is borne of royall blood, who is now in the keepers house in safetie, with whom I haue beene these two houres: now cast off those stormy discontents and cloudes of care, for there is no further cause of disquiet for his supposed death. Angelica then verily beleeuing his words, said. Good brother, tell me how he doth, for whose safetie I reioyce? for of all the knights that euer I beheld, I neuer liked nor loued any so well, desiring you withall, to keepe my counsell, (hauing bewrayed my secrets to none else) and not to let him know so much as I haue tolde you. Then should both you and I do him wrong (quoth he) for he hath well deserued loue, and especially at your hands, to whom by his owne report, hee hath long ago dedicated himselfe, and not onely of his owne inclination, but of a high command: for the trueth of which, he hath vpon trust of my secrecie, reuealed to me, which you shall likewise heare: then hee discoursed the whole trueth, euen as the Knight of Fame had before done: which when she heard, she said. What a discourteous Lady is that Venola , to seeke the ouerthrow of so woorthie a Knight? and how may I esteeme him, that before hee knewe mee, was so constant in his loue, without hope of my fauour, and refused the proffered loue of two such Ladies for my sake: besides the perill he hath indured in my search, and peraduenture is sprung of greater birth then my selfe. And now also by my Parents doome, was put in that hazard of his life. Good brother be you carefull of his good, and whatsoeuer you shall counsell me too, I will do: if my father should know of his safetie, then were there no meanes for him to escape death: for such a hard conceit of suspect doth possesse his minde, that hee hateth all those that beare mee any shewe of good will. Well sister (quoth Marcellus ) rest you contented, and stil continue your loue to him wards, to increase & not diminish the same, who is by destinie allotted to be your husband: the care of whose welfare let be my charge: for I so much loue and esteeme him, both for his owne and your sake, that I will leaue no meanes vnassayed, whereby to do you good: which said, he againe departed to the knight of Fame . By this time darke night approached, and Marcellus and the Knight of Fame were deuising what meanes to vse for his safetie, and to procure the desired content Angelica expected, who before had giuen her consent to be ruled by her brother: that by the assurance he had of her, he put the Knight of Fame in assured comfort of her loue, by relating in some sort, the contents of Angelicas conference before had with him, which affected his heart with greater ioy, then euer before hee had indured greefe: that his escape from death did not comfort his heart so much as this happy newes. At last Marcellus said: Noble knight, you see how strictly my father gardeth An . that ther is no means left to ease your greef or her care by tarrying here: neither can you without great hazard of your life, remaine within the circuit of this Tower: for that my father suspecteth euery one, yea his owne children, whereby wee are tired with those troubles, and would willingly worke any meanes to ease our selues: especially Angelica hath been mewed vp so closely, that shee I am sure would vndertake any thing to enioy her libertie, were it in neuer so poore estate, wherein in my opinion is many thousands of sweete contents to be found, rather then in this troublesome pompe, which is repleat with infinit cares. Therefore this is my censure, that you shall this night (as I will direct you) depart from hence, and go to S. Austines Chappell, not far hence, & there stay for me vntill to morrow morning, where remaineth an old religious Priest, named Iabine , who if you say you come fro me, will giue you entertainmet; which whe you haue don, I wil so work with my sister Angelica , that he shall condiscend by such meanes as I will worke for her secret escape, to come to you: by which I hope I shall ende the doubts that possesse my fathers mind, ridde their countrie of the scandall it is likely to runne into: and worke both mine owne, yours, and Angelicas content: for so dearely do I loue her, that had I many liues to loose, I would hazard them all, to worke her releasement: for were shee once married, then should the date of the foolish prophecie haue ende. The Knight of Fame hearing his speeches, which onely tended to worke the content, hee aboue all things in the world sought, could not well containe himselfe from expressing immeasurable ioy, but yeelding many humble and heartie thankes to Marcellus , both commended his deuise, and also intreated him to go forward with the same. Then Marcellus called vp the keeper, asking his counsell if he knew any deuise whereby the Knight of Fame might get out of the Castle, promising him a good reward: and withall, pulling from his necke a chaine of golde, gaue him the same. The keeper beeing intised with this reward, (golde hauing that force, to make things impossible come to effect) presently tolde them, hee had a deuise that might go for currant, if the Knight would vndertake the same. I haue my Lord (quoth he) a vessell of great largenesse, which sometimes sorted for other vses, which if we could deuise to let downe into the lake, he might easily in that get ouer on to the other side: which deuise Marcellus and the Knight of Fame both liked. And about midnight, when all things were at rest, they put this same in practise, and by a rope let the vessell downe, which swam most currantly. Then fastning a rope about the Knight of Fames middle, after that, (with many promises and protestations of perpetuall friendship) they had taken their leaues, the keeper and Marcellus let him downe, who was so heauie by reason of the waight of his own body and his armour, that they had much ado from letting him fall, and being in the vessell, was like to sinke the same. But with much ado and great daunger of drowning, by reason of the tottering and vnstayednesse of the vessell, which with euery little waight more on one side then on the other, was ready to turne ouer, hee got on to the banke, which was so steep vpwards, that hee had much ado to clime vp the same, but was oftentimes ready to fall downe backwards into the Lake, which was of an exceeding great and huge depth: but hauing happily escaped both those daungers, he departed towards Saint Augustines Chappel, according to such directions Marcellus had giuen him to finde the same. Marcellus and the keeper drew vp the Uessell, and betooke themselues to their rest. The Knight of Fame had not well remembred Marcellus speeches, and therefore hauing gone some halfe mile from the Golden Tower, fearing to wander out of the way, he tooke vp his lodging vnder a Cipresse Tree, spending the whole night in manifolde meditations, of the successe of this businesse: being oftentimes in great dispaire of euer seeing Angelica againe, drawne to that feare, by reason of Maximus iealousie, and the diligent watch he had set in euery corner of the Tower, but especially at the entrance, where none went out and in, but the gardiants searched them, that his minde was sometimes wrackt with dispaire, and sometime animated to comfort by the assured trust he had in Marcellus . The night being by him in this sort spent, in the morning he betooke himselfe againe to his iourney, & with ease found out Saint Austins Chappell, and knocking at the Chappell doore, it was long before any came, but at last he espied olde Iabin standing behinde him, who had beene abroade very early, and then returned, whom the Knight of Fame most kindly saluted. Iabin maruelling to see one in Armor, demaunded what he would haue? Right reuerend Father (quoth he) I am sent to you by Marcellus , whose request is, that you would for his sake vouchsafe my secret abode with you vntill his comming, which will be this day, if contrary occasion hinder him not. Iabin noting his comely proportion, and willing to do anything for Marcellus sake, brought him into his Cell adioyning to the Chappell, and welcommed him so kindly as hee could. How Marcellus entending to carrie Angelica to Saint Austins Chappell, was preuented by Camillus . And how the Knight of Fame departed to seeke his parents. pensiue, to whom he declared what had passed betwixt him and the Knight of Fame , and withall, of the promise hee had made him to bring her to Saint Austins Chappell. Which when Angelica hearing, she said: Brother, how can this be effected, when you see so many impossibilities to hinder our intent, that we shall but spent much labour to little effect, and also rather bring my fathers heauie displeasure against vs, then reape any comfort? whose crueltie you see is such, that he will if he should finde out our drift, punish vs with severitie: besides, if it should come to that passe, what excuse could you finde to pacifie his ire? Therefore I thinke it best, that we neuer hazard our selues, but rather be conteted with this quiet estate, least a worse mischance light vpon vs thereby. Sister (quoth Marcellus ) your counsell is good, but yet heare what I shall say: the life you leade is but miserable, being kept like a prisoner: whereas, if you could but win this libertie, you should enioy your fill of hearts content, and be a meanes to rid my father and vs all, from the doubts we may now endure. Besides, if you loued that worthy Knight, whose constancie to you wards is without compare, you wold for his sake, refuse no perill. Why brother (quoth shee) what neede you make any such doubt, when I haue said sufficient alreadie, vnlesse you thinke me to dissemble: for such is my loue and good will, that I will more willingly vndertake any meanes to attaine his company, then he can desire: not drawne by your perswasion, but of my owne voluntary will: which haue made some doubt of this attempt, because I am fearefull of your ill, and carefull of your good: but whatsoeuer you shall counsaile me vnto, I will execute. Which said, they began to studie and consult how to bring their businesse about: but were so confounded in their thoughts, that they thought it altogither impossible. Now Maximus being ridde of Camillus company, and assured of the Knight of Fames death, gaue his minde to more quiet, then during the time of their being there he had done: and being wearied with care, thought to recreate himselfe by some exercise: therefore he appointed the very same day, to ride on hunting: and to that intent he was early vp, sending for Angelica to go with the Queene, euen at the instant when she was deuising with Marcellus : which opportunitie fell out most conuenientlie to further their intent, which Marcellus told her he would determine off. Angelica immediately went downe with the messenger: and with the King and Queene, Marcellus and diuers others departed out of the tower. Marcellus all that day kept diligent company with Angelica , vntill the king being earnest in pursuite of the game, strayed from them: the Queene likewise was absent, and most of Angelicas gardiants, sauing some sixe, being indeede such as Marcellus had before made priue to his intent, who had firmely protested to keepe his counsaile: which opportunitie Marcellus tooke, and presently conueyed Angelica towards Saint Austins Chappell: being without the Parke, when they thought themselues farre inough from the king, they were vnawares set vpon by a company of strange knights, who offered by force to carrie away Angelica . Marcellus being somewhat astonisht thereat, drew his sword, and being before well prouided, withstood them. Angelicas gardiants did the like: that on a suddaine there began a cruell combat betwixt them, vntill Marcellus was greeuously wounded, one of his company slain, and the rest in as great danger as might be: but being a knight of exceeding courage, he defended himselfe most valiantly. So long continued the fight, that in the mean time, some of the kings company hauing the charge of Angelica , mist her, which he soone declared to the king, who commaunded his knights to post euery way by seuerall troupes: himselfe and the Queene well guarded, tooke the readiest way out of the Parke: which was the same way Marcellus and Angelica had taken, and hasting, came to the place where they were in the hottest of their skirmish. The strange knights espying the King, presently fled with all possible speede, whom many of the Natolians pursued so far, vntill they might discrie a band of souldiers: wherewith they returned with all possible speede, and certified the King, who presently hasted to the Golden Tower, with the Queene, Marcellus , and Angelica in his company: and by reason of the straungers he sawe in fight with Marcellus , he hadde not the least suspition of Angelicaes entended flight: and maruelling what that Armie should meane, hee sent out spyes to viewe of what force they were, who hauing done the thing, they went and certified him that they were tenne thousand Souldiers, but they could not discerne vnder whose conduct. Maximus fearing the woorst presently sent letters to the Nobles of his land, withall expedition to muster vp their forces, and to conuey them to the Golden Tower: and also caused most diligent watch and ward to be kept. Marcellus being most greeuously wounded, was likewise with all care tended by the Kings Phisitians, to whom Angelica repaired: and beeing with him alone, she said as followeth. What miserie awaiteth my hard destenie, that am thus disasterly deteined from my wished content? my euill presaging minde, did foretell this misfortune, which hath thus frustrated our desire, and which is more miserable, brought you to this daungerous estate: but most of all withheld me from the sight of my beloued, and causeth him both to augment his cares, and suspect our loyaltie. What will he thinke when he seeth no performance of that which was promised, but still stayeth for our comming, and yet be frustrated? for the knowledge of our mischance, can by no meanes come to his hearing. Would to God that I had ended my accursed life, by the hands of those enemies, rather then to haue suruiued to endure this extreame care. No hard fortune can be compared to that I endure, no care comparable to my greefe. First to see you thus greeuously wounded: next to bee disappointed of our desire: and lastly to frustrate the knight of Fame of his expectation. What shall we now doo? how shall we recure this mishap? or what meanes is there left, that may adde the least comfort to our harts in this extremitie? In stead of the content I expected by enioying his presence, I am returned to my woonted bondage: and see my friends almost murdred and inuironed with foes. Peace peace (quoth Marcellus ) good Angelica , cease these coplaints, and in this extremitie, immitate the old phrase: make a vertue of necessitie, and with patience awaight for better successe: for now in these perplexities, there is small hope of present amendment: for that worthie knight no doubt is of such wisedome and prudent gouernment, that he will iudge the best of our state, and carefully prouide for his owne safetie. With that, Angelica burst forth into abundance of teares, saying. Ay me poore wretch, I shall then neuer see him againe. With that she departed, wringing her hands, and making great lamentation, that Marcellus seeing her sorrowe, was readie to worke his owne decay by his vexation. Now those bands of souldiers belonging to Camillus , who presently after his departure from the Golden Tower, enduring many restlesse passions, for want of Angelicas presence, with whome hee was greatly in loue: with all speede mustered vp those forces, and brought them by shipping towards the Tower, with intent to besiege the same, and suddainly to surprise Maximus vnawares, and so to get the possession of Angelica : and comming towards the Golden Tower with a fewe in his company, whilest the rest marched after him, he met Marcellus and Angelica , and knowing them, thought without any more trouble to take her away, but was disappoynted as is declared. The Knight of Fame being with olde Iabine , spent much part of the day in conference with him, maruelling that he heard not from Marcellus : but when it was darke night, his minde was rackt with exceeding care and vexation, and being without any hope of his comming, he was as much greeued how to satisfie Iabine , whom hee thought would now suspect him of falsehood: and might suppose hee came not from Marcellus . Therefore he said as followeth. Father, I maruell that I haue not heard from Marcellus , according to his promise, which maketh me thinke that some crosse mischance hath hindred him, that may breede in you some misconceit of me, that haue in his name come vnto you, which if you do, you shall much iniurie me: for it was hee that sent mee hither, as I could assure you by diuers probable reasons. Sir knight (quoth he) I pray be not troubled with any such thoght, for you are welcome to me, though Marcellus had not sent you, which I make no doubt of, but so well do I loue him, as that whosoeuer commeth in his name, shall by the strickt obseruance I beare to that name, commaund me any seruice. Afterwards they went to their repast, with such sparing diet as the Priest vsed, and after supper to bedde: where the knight of Fame could take no rest at all, but yet lay very quietly, because he was loth to trouble his Host: with which restraint of libertie of speech, and other passions that opprest his sences, he indured that tedious night in great torment, which seemed longer then many nights would haue done, if hee might haue had libertie to vtter his lamentations, which boyled in his breast like the violence of a mightie flame pend within a small compasse. Early the next morning, Iabine went forth for to prouide foode, and left the knight of Fame alone, who then vttered many complaints, but at last finding fault with himselfe for vrging that effeminate kind of lamentation, he striuing to ouermaister his passions, which the more he laboured to asswage, the more they increased. In this sort he continued all that day and the next, and many daies after, still being in good hope of Marcellus approach: but when he saw so long time past, and he could heare no newes from him, he beganne to accuse him of discourtesie and disloyaltie, for breaking his promise: and withall, grew into a setled perswasion, that both hee and Angelica had quite forsaken him: which added greefe to greefe, and more care and vexation to his minde, not knowing what to do, nor which way to shape his course: that arming himselfe one day, hee mounted himself, and wandred in a melancholly studie towards the Golden Tower, and by chaunce met with two of Maximus knights, who were exceedingly astonisht at his sight, taking him to bee a ghost: but hee drawing nigh to them, they beganne to flie, which hee perceiuing, thought to stay the one of them, to haue some further speech with him, that charging his launce at him, and hitting him full, ouerthrewe him to the grownd: the other being therewith exceedingly terrified, fledde. The Knight of Fame alighting, comming to him that he had ouerthrowne, thus said. Knight, thou needest not to haue fledde from me, for I intended thee no harme, but was desirous to knowe some newes of thee, which if thou wilt tell mee, I will let thee depart: otherwise, thou shalt neuer escape my hands. The knight maruelling to heare him speake, whom he thought had been a ghost, made this reply. Pardon me good sir, for I tooke you to bee another then I see you are, but if I may know what you will commaund me, I will do it. (Quoth he) tell me how fareth Marcellus ? Sir (quoth he) at this instant he lyeth very weake, by reason of many greeuous wounds he receiued not long since: where hee declared the whole trueth of that which had happened by Maximus meanes, since which time (quoth hee) the king hath sette such secret watch about the Tower, that none goeth in nor out without his priuitie. The Knight of Fame hauing heard his speeches, departed backe to Iabine , to whom he declared the trueth of all that he had heard, beeing very sorry for Marcellus hurt, and well waying euery circumstance of that report, thought that when Marcellus was gotten with Angelica out of the Parke, so slightly attended, it was to come to him: which added some comfort to his heart, being fully assured thereby, that Angelica had not forsaken him. By this time the Natolian that escaped from the Knight of Fame , was come to the Golden Tower, and comming before the King, told him that he had met the Knight of Fame : whereat hee beganne to laugh: but presently came the other, who iustified the same words: alleadging that it was the Knight of Fame , and that he had both talked with him, and knew him, affirming the same most constantly. Maximus wondring thereat, was almost astonisht at their words, that he determined to send all his knights to search for him, and the occasion now most fitly serued: for the Nobles had according to his commaund, gathered a number of forces togither, which Camillus seeing, beeing vnprouided to withstand such force, but comming for an other intent, immediately returned with his souldiers towards his countrie, and Maximus now seeing the coast cleare of enemies, presently sent foorth knights euery way to finde the knight of Fame . This newes was soone come to Marcellus and Angelicas hearing, which filled their hearts with exceeding care and feare, least hee should bee apprehended: this bredde newe sorrowes in their troubled thoughts, but principally in Angelicas , whose loue was growne to such perfection, that it was impossible for to remooue the same: that getting to her chaber, she entred into many heauie coplaints, able to haue rent the stoniest harts of the cruelest tyrants: whom Anna comforted by al means she could deuise: to whom Angelica said. Oh Anna (quoth she) little doest thou know the torments my heart doth indure, for wert thou so much inthralled as I am, and to so woorthie a knight as he is, thou mightest then haue some insight into my sorrowes: but being ignorant therein, how canst thou giue me counsell? haue I not cause to sorrow? nay rather to runne mad with sorrow, to see the danger that woorthie knight is now in, hauing so lately escaped a most miserable death, by my fathers censure? and without cause, who not contented therewith, nor satisfied in his mind, hath now sent out many knights to search for him: who if they finde him, will bring him back, or by violence destroy him, whose death shall bee the end of my life: for I haue vowed, if my father seeke his ruine, he shall likewise see my death, for I will not liue one houre after him: in which complaints she still continued without intermission. It fortuned most happily, that Iabine was gone foorth of S. Austines Chappell, and left the knight of Fame in his Cell, meeting with many of ye Natolian knights, who demaded if he saw not such a K. describing well as they could) the knight of Fame , whom he answered al after one sort, that he had not seen any such: but maruelling at their earnest inquirie, hee demaunded what that knight might bee? One of them tolde him, that he was called the knight of Fame , who lately arriued in that countrie, and was kindly entertained by Maximus , but especially of Marcellus , and hauing in some sort offended the King, was by him afterwards thrown into the Lyons den, by reason of a letter the king of Libia sent, wherein he accused him to haue dishonoured Venola his onely daughter, whom that day was seene and spoken withall. Iabine hearing his speeches, wondred thereat, yet notwithstanding was carefull least the knight of Fame , should be found abroad, whom hee now beganne greatly to esteeme, both that he deemed him to bee sprung of royall blood, and also for that Marcellus made estimation of him: who he thought knew him cleare of those accusations, or else he would not haue fauoured him so much: that with all speed he hasted to his Cell, where being entred, he found the Knight of Fame very sadde, and fast bolting the Chappell doore, he came to him, saying. Worthie Knight, I am glad that I haue found you heere, for were you abroad, there are such a number of Knights in search of you, that it were impossible to escape them. For me (quoth he) I thinke you are deceiued. Yea (quoth he) if you are called the Knight of Fame , and lately escaped out of the Lyons denne. With that his colour changed. Nay (quoth Iabine ) feare not, for you shall be heere as safe as your heart can wish; for this place is no way suspected, therefore thinke your selfe secure: then Iabine declared vnto him all that had happened, and what hee had heard. Wherevpon the Knight of Fame likewise finding him faithful and secret, declared vnto him the whole discourse of his trauels, onely leauing out the vision which appeared to him in Thrace . Asking his counsell what to do, and entring into many sadde discourses, how hee was still crossed in his expectation: and withall, tolde him that he knew not which way to trauel in search of his Parents, which if he could attaine, then he would not doubt but to reuenge those iniurious wrongs done him. Sir Knight (quoth Iabine ) I thinke it best that you trauell in search of them, and that presently: in the meane time these troubles by forgetfulnesse will be well ouerblowne, and then you may haue the better opportunitie to go forward with any intent you shal afterwards put in practise: for if you stay heere, you may vnfortunately be descried, for the Kings iealousie is such, that he will leaue no means vnattempted to worke your death. Father (quoth he) your counsell is good, which I will put in practise, not voluntarily, but forced thereto in regard of mine owne preseruation: requesting this one fauour at your hands, that you woulde by some meanes remember my humble dutie to that honourable Knight Marcellus : and tell him that it shall not be long ere I returne: desiring him in the meane time (according to his former curtesie, which hath bin extended far beyond my desert) to remaine my friend, and remember me to Angelica . I wil (quoth Iabine ) fulfill your request in euery respect. But first (quoth he) I thinke it most couenient you change your armor, for that in that you are easily knowne: and I haue one within, that is euery way of as good proofe. The Knight of Fame liked his deuice exceedingly well, and armed himselfe in that armour, which was very rich and costly, guilded all ouer with Golde and and Amell, without any deuise to be knowne by: and in that armour the next night he departed, taking his leaue of olde Iabine with many courtesies, being most vnwilling to leaue his company: and parting with a heauie heart, for that he went to vndertake a new trauell, which might detaine him long from returning to Angelica : and by good fortune, that night he gat out of the countrey, and past the search of the Natolians , whom hee did not care to meete withall, but that he would not thereby hinder the speed of his iourney. How the Knight of Fame arriued in the countrey of Bohemia , and redeemed Violetta from Archas . How Archas was put to death. How the Knight of Fame came to the knowledge of his parents, and after that, departed againe towards Natolia . After that the Knight of Fame was past the bounds of Natolia , he arriued in an exceeding great plain, where he saw many ready pathes, but knew not which of them to take: at last, a suddaine thought and remembrance of Parismus entred his fancie, which so fully possest his minde, that the thought thereof, would by no meanes remooue: which was so effectually wrought in him by a naturall affect for there were his parents, and no where else, which caused nature it selfe, to pittie his restlesse passions, and no longer to procrastinate his felicitie, that hee fullie and resolutely determined to trauell thither. Whither afterwards with long trauell he attained, hauing great desire to see Parismus againe, to whom his heart had vowed euerlasting friendship. And now drawing nigh the court, in the afternoone when the sunne had with his scorching beames made the season hotte, he heard a greeuous complaint, as it seemed to his hearing, of some distressed lady, which made him stay to listen which way that crie came, and by the voyce, drawing nigh to the place, hee espied vnder the shadowe of a heape of Elmes, a knight in Armour, and a Lady at his feet, who were the same that made that mone. The Knight of Fame comming neare them, they both espied him, to the Ladies comfort: but the Knight presently tooke vp his shield, and addressed himselfe for his defence. The Knight of Fame well noting the Ladies countenance, remembred that he had seene her, but he could not remember where, which caused him the more willing to helpe her: being otherwise of his owne vertuous inclination, ready to succour any distressed Lady: that comming to her, he demaunded her cause of sorrow: but she being readie to make him aunswere, and holding vp her hands to craue his pittie, the other Knight setting his sword against her brest, vowing, that if she spake one word, he would thrust the same through her body: which the knight of Fame seeing, thinking he went about to slay her, with his sword drawne, rusht violently against him, and ouerthrew him: but giuing him leaue to recouer his feete, he said: Traiterous villaine, why offerest thou this Lady such discourtesie, being ashamed she should declare thy trecherie: which maugre thy hart, I will know before we two part? with that he lent him such a blowe, that he made him stagger: the Knight thought himselfe now in worse case then euer he had bene: but notwithstanding, he resisted the knight of Fame most couragiously for a space, but he being the most gallantest knight in the world, soone brought him in great daunger of his life: which when the knight saw and felt, he staied himselfe, and said. Knight, before the combat continue any longer, let me know your name? I will not shew thee that fauour (quoth the knight of Fame ) but wish thee yeeld thy selfe: neither will I shew thee that fauour (quoth he) with that he began the combat againe, being scarce able to lift vp his sword, by reason of his faintnesse by effusion of bloud, intending to ende his life: which the knight of Fame perceiuing, clasped him in his armes, & with violence wrong his sword out of his hands, and by force made him yeelde, hauing no weapon to offend himselfe nor his aduersary. The Lady seeing her selfe thus fortunately deluered, comming to the knight of Fame , desired him to pittie her estate, and not to forsake her vntill she were come to the Bohemian court. With that, the knight of Fame was exceedingly glad, saying: Lady, I will not forsake you, but see you there in safetie, for thither am I bound. But I pray you (quoth he) let me know your name, for that I haue I am sure seene you about the Forrest of Arde ? Violetta with that was drawne into a great admiration what he should be, at last she said: my name is Violetta , that am ordained to perpetuall miserie, beeing indeede by the trecherie of a disloyall knight named Archas , driuen to wander thitherwards: The knight of Fame then immediately remembring her, but beeing vnwilling to discouer himself, questioned no more with her, but only asked her what that knight was? Sir knight (quoth she) I know him not, nor why he hath offered me this outrage. Which said, the knight of Fame forced him to go with them, and so they all departed towards the court, where very soone they arriued. Now it hapned, that Parismus at that very instant was in the court, who espying Violetta accompanied by two knights, the one of them being greeuously wouded, and as it were by his countenance, and maner of forced comming, seeming captiue to the other, and not knowing of any misaduenture that had befallen her, wondred thereat: and comming to her, not wel knowing in what sort to salute those knights, beeing ignorant of the cause of their coming, he demaded where she had bin? My Lord (quoth she) this knight, meaning the knight of Fame , hath preserued me from the dishonor of this most discourteous knight, intended against me, as I will declare vnto you presently. With that Parismus most kindly embraced the knight of Fame , departing altogither into the presence, where was the king & queen, Pollipus, Laurana , and many others. Pollipus seeing Violetta amongst those strange knights, maruelled thereat, but she coming before the king, vpo her knees desired iustice against the wouded knight: the king told her that she should haue iustice. Violetta then said, as followeth. Most mightie king, I beseech you regard my complaint: reuenge the monstrous wrong don me by this most wicked and abhominable homicide, who hath offred monstrous outrage: for this afternoone, attended by my damozell, I went forth of the court into the groue adioyning to the garden, to recreate my selfe in the cooly shade: where I had not long stayed, but this discourteous Villaine surprised me, and caught hold of my damzel, who made great exclamation, fearing my harme, whom he bound both hand and foote: threatning if she made any noyse, to murther her. Which done, he tooke me by violence, and halling and pulling me most rudely and discourteously, wold haue conueyed me I know not whither, vntill this valiant Knight by good fortune, hearing my complaints, redeemed me from his tyrannie. The King hearing her speeches, commanded the knight to discouer himselfe, but he being exceedingly ashamed, and loath to be knowne, refused the same: but at last, by some of the Bohemian Knights was vnarmed, when presently Violetta knew him, wherewith she gaue an exceeding start, as if she had beene affrighted at his sight. Parismus and Pollipus likewise knew him, certifying the King, that it was Archas , that had before offered the like villanie to Violetta , which the King well remembred. Then he said: cruell tyrant, what excuse canst thou inuent to shelter this villanie? What canst thou alleage in thy defence, but that thou oughtest to suffer the most reproachful death that can be inuented? but this censure will I giue of thee, not to fauour thee, but to deale iustly with that Knight, whose prisoner thou art, and therefore, as hee by right hath conquered thee, so wee will that he shall be thy iudge. The Knight of Fame had all this while diligently viewed Lauranaes bewtie, her countenance, and euery part of her behauiour, that he tooke great delight in viewing her, but hearing the kings speech, he vnarmed his head, whom Parismus soone knew, and most louingly embraced: likewise Pollipus and Violetta knowing him, saluted him with many curtesies: when presently Parismus declared vnto his father, that it was the famous knight that was called the Knight of Fame . The King hearing that it was he, of whom he had heard so many honourable reports, rose from his Kingly seate, and embraced him most louingly: and euery one in generall, seemed to be most exceedingly delighted with his presence. Laurana beholding his countenance, felt an exceeding throbbing suddainly possesse her heart: withall, such a violent blushing flasht in her face, that she wodred whence such suddain motions shold proceed, and was constrained to turne aside, least any should perceiue her changing countenance, and withdrew her selfe to a window. This alteration being wrought in her by a naturall instinct, which she was altogither ignorant of. The Knight of Fame not vnmindfull to satisfie Violettas wrong, by som reuenge against Archas , most humbly thankt the King for honouring him so much, by giuing him authoritie to giue his doome: but (quoth he) I most humbly intreat your Highnesse to pardon mee, and desire your wisedome, to whom he hath beene offensiue, to vse him as you please: for it were great presumption for me, in this strange place to censure of him in your Maiesties presence. Then the King called Archas , commaunding him to declare what mooued him to commit that outrage to Violetta : but he assuring himselfe of no lesse then death, would make no aunswere: where vppon the king commaunding him to be had to prison, appoynted that the next day he should loose his head, which was accordingly performed: who might peraduenture haue beene pardoned, but that his own conscience accused him more then those whom he had offended. And so according to his own folly, which had brought him to commit those wicked acts, euen so he was his owne Iudge: for that his guiltie conscience would not suffer him to aske pardon. After this iudgement giuen, euery mans minde was in quiet, hauing sufficiently scand the circumstance of Violettas misfortune. The Knight of Fame was royally entertained, and honourably feasted by the king of Bohemia , but especially Parismus and Laurana vsed him with exceeding kindnesse, being for that night driuen to part from him without any conference. But Laurana was so exceedingly troubled with his remembrance, that she could scarce take any rest all that night for thinking on him, not knowing what should mooue her to such vnwoonted alteration, that in the morning when Parismus and she were in some conference about the Knight of Fame , she said. My Lord, I knowe not what should mooue me to thinke any such thought, but I am perswaded, that his arriuall will bring vs either some vnexpected ioy, or suddaine sorrow: for since I first saw him, my heart hath neuer beene quiet: neither can I, though I striue to the contrary, once put his remembrance out of my minde, which hath so fully possest my fancie, that I could take no rest this night. My selfe (quoth Parismus ) haue felt the selfe same passion, not onely now, but also at my first meeting with him in the Forrest of Arde : which maketh me partly of the selfe same opinion with you, and also desirous to knowe of whence he is. In this and such like communication they continued some time, till Parismus left her, and went to the Knight of Fame , who was alreadie in company of Pollipus , whom Parismus most kindly vsed, and afterwardes beeing at a most royall feast, which was prepared onely for his more honourable welcome: after dinner being requested by Parismus (who was desirous to know of whence he was) there being the King and Queene, Parismus, Laurana, Pollipus , and Violetta , and diuers others, he beganne to declare the whole discourse of his trauels to them in this sort. If I should declare my name and birth (quoth he) I know not how to beginne: for that I am my selfe ignorant thereof: but so much as I can remember, I will hide no part from you. I was brought vp in a countrie in Tartaria , called the Iland of Rockes , my Parents for any thing I knowe, being poore, or whether they were or no, I know not, but when I was of some remembrance, either my mother that brought me vp, or rather my nurse (for she would not suffer me to call her mother) departed from her habitation. I know not with what intent, but by the way a Lyon slew her: whom I pursued to his denne: where beeing come, I could not returne backe to my nurse, by which meanes I stayed in that place many yeares, vntill on a time, she appeared vnto me in a dream, warning me to forsake that vnfrequented place, and go to the Castle of Rockes : which I presently did, then not knowing what a castle ment: where at the first I was roughly handled, but at last I was kindly vsed by Tyresus , who brought me vp a long time, with whom I departed to sea: where by a mightie tempest, the shippe and all that were in the same were cast away, my selfe onely was cast on the shore in Thrace : where I was succoured by the good Duke Amasenus , in whose Court I was often like to be destroyed, by some of his knights that enuied mee: from whence I departed to the Kings Court, hearing of a generall triumph that was helde: the kings daughter beeing appoynted the conquerours reward: whom I wanne, and was determined to haue maried: from which I was warned of by a vision, which willed me to surrender my title in Phylena , to Remulus , to whom she was before betrothed: which I did, and also that I should trauell in search of my Parents, which the vision tolde me were of kingly race: and withall, gaue me another commaund, that I should loue no Lady, vntill I had found out that Lady that was shewne mee in the vision: this did greatly trouble me, when presently came newes of Tyrides death, sonne to Duke Amasenus , who was slain by Brandamor in rescue of Venola , whom he had the custodie of: vpon which occasion I trauelled first to Libia , and from thence to the Forrest of Arde , thinking Venola had beene the same Lady appeared to mee in the vision, where I met with your Highnesse, and with you departed to the Court of the king of Libia , after Venola was redeemed, as your selfe remember, who was not the Lady I went in search of. Afterwards when I had thought to haue departed with you towardes this countrie, Venola by subtiltie causing mee to take a sleepie potion, frustrated my desire, which she did to stay me with her vpon a pretence of great loue she bare me, which one afterwards made me acquainted withall: which when I heard, being inioyned to place my affections on another, fearing some mischance might arise by her loue, and finding out with what deuise they had frustrated me of your company, I departed without knowledge of any from thence: and at last after long trauel, arriued in Notalia , where lying downe to rest my selfe beeing wearie, it happened the Lady Angelica (the most fairest Lady liuing) to passe by, whom after I had seene, I perfectly knewe to be the Ladie that appeared to me in the vision, hauing after such good successe, that I was entertained by Maximus the King, at the golden Tower, and there grew into great acquaintance with Marcellus . I had not long remained there, but the King of Libia (as I suppose, perswaded therto by Venolas meanes) wrote a letter vnto Maximus , that he would for his sake either send mee to him, or else be reuenged on mee by my death: alleadging that I had dishonoured his daughter: which accusation was most false and vntrue. Herevpon the King without hearing what I could say in mine owne defence, immediately cast me into a denne of fearce Lyons, who refused to hurt mee, where I remained many daies, hauing no other food but such as was cast to them: from whence afterwards I escaped by the Keepers meanes, whom I compelled to send for Marcellus , who rid mee out of the Tower, and sent me to an auncient friend of his named Iabin , a Priest of Saint Austines Chappell, promising to come to me the next day, but was disappoynted thereof by such meanes as is not yet come to my knowledge. Upon a day I went abroad from the Chappell, and by misfortune was espied by some of the Kings Knights, who certified him (as I thinke that I was a liue: wherevpon he againe most vniustly sought my life,) and sent out thousands in my search: from whose hands I escaped, intending to finde my Parents, and so trauelled hitherwards. This (quoth he) is the briefe and true rehearsall of my trauels and bringing vp, so far as I know: hauing nothing whereby to be otherwise known, but a Iewell which my nurse gaue me great charge to keepe, whose minde I haue fulfilled. With that he puld out of his bosome the iewel, which he continually wore about his necke, which Laurana hauing diligently viewed, perfectly knew to be the same she had left with Parismenos in the Iland of Rocks , who she assuredly (both by that & many other probabilities) knew to be her sonne, that suddainly before them all, she caught him in her armes and cried. Oh my sonne Parismenos , thou art my sonne: many times kissing and embracing him. Her straunge behauiour draue them all in admiration. When suddainly the place where they were beganne to waxe darke, that they could scarce see one another, and they heard a voyce, which they knew not from whence it should come, which said. Parismus welcome thy son Parismenos , long time absent from thee: thou needest not doubt of it, for none is so like thee in heroicall quallities: which saide, the darknesse presently vanished. By this they all assuredly knew that the knight of Fame was son to Parismus and Laurana , who likewise assured himselfe that hee had found his Parents: that presently he kneeled downe, whom Parismus , the king, the Queene, and Laurana , most louingly all at once incompassed with their kinde embracings, reioycing most exceedingly for ioy that he was found: beeing vnable by wordes, welcomes, embracings, or otherwise, to expresse their gladnesse. Parismus reioycing that he had so valiant and vertuous a sonne, the king and Queen glad that in their olde age they sawe so vertuous an impe sprung foorth of their issue to succeede in the kingdome. And Laurana with teares of ioy expressing her content, in that she had found her son whom shee thought had been destroyed long ago: that no hart is able to expresse the ioy that possest their harts. Pollipus and Violetta they likewise embraced him, being as glad as any of the rest, of his safetie. This newes was soone spred throgh the whole Court, & from thence, flying fame soone broght the knowledge therof to the Citizens, who of their owne accord, rung their bels, made bonfiers & triumphs, throgh the whole citie: where on all sides, was such exceeding reioysings, as is impossible to be exprest. Many daies afterwards, the Knight of Fame who now shall assume his right and proper name Parismenos , continued in the Bohemian Court, honourablie entertained, and highly esteemed of the Bohemian states: who grew into exceeding loue towards him, and was kindly-beloued of the King and Queene, but especiallie of his parents, who thought themselues most happie and blessed to haue such a sonne: whose Fame was spread through most places of all the Worlde, and that euery mans eares were filled with the report of his most honourable deedes. Now that Parismenos had thus happily attained the knowledge of his parents, the want whereof had long time filled his minde with care, no other thought but of Angelicas loue could take place in his heart, which (though his cause of ioy otherwise was sufficient) filled his sences with sadnesse, and quite extinguisht those delights, that they seemed to his troubled minde, rather tedious then comfortable: adding no ease to his care, which were augmented to an exceeding height, by reason of Maximus crueltie, which he saw was so much aggrauated against him, that he knew it a thing impossible for him to attaine the least fauour at his hands: who likewise kept Angelica guarded so strongly, and so narrowlie pried into all her actions, that it was impossible any way, either to come to her speech, or to send to her: that with diuersitie of the cogitations, his heart was tormented, his countenance darkened, and he spent his time most commonly in sadnesse: being seldome drawne to any myrth, which was generally noted of all men: but especially of Laurana , who could neuer be quiet but onely in his company. And on a day missing him, she rested not vntill she had found him out, being gotten into the most sollitary place in the garde, leaning himselfe vpon his elbow: who espying her, raised himselfe from the ground, blushing at her presence, to whom she said. Why how now Parismenos , what sadnesse is that which possesseth your minde, that maketh you estrange your selfe from company, to delight in sollitarinesse? is there none so highly in your fauour, that they may know the truth thereof? or is your cause of care such as none can remedie? or not counsell you for your case? I am sure there are many would not refuse to vse their endeuours to pleasure you, especially my selfe would both willingly do my best to comfort you, and know the cause, if it be not too secret. Parismenos with humble reuerence made her this aunswere: I beseech you do not thinke me so vndutifull: nor my cause of care so secret, that I would conceale the same from you: but were it of much more importance, I would willingly reueale it to satisfie your minde: which I haue omitted, as vnwilling to trouble you therwith, and for no other respect. Then I pray (quoth she) let me know, is it not loue? yes most deare mother (quoth he) it is loue, and to that bewtiful Lady Angelica , who beareth me the like affection: but so farre am I from enioying her loue, as that it attainteth my heart with care to thinke thereof, which is the cause of my sadnesse: which will encrease rather then diminish, if I do not shortly trauell thither, being now assured of all other doubts, and hauing finished my trauell in search to finde you out. Therefore, I most humbly beseech you to procure my Lord and fathers consent to my speedie departure, for without the fruition of her heauenly sight, my life will be but wearisome. Laurana hearing his speeches, perceiued indeede, that his affection was great, and therefore not to be remooued, and well knowing by her owne former experience, that loue was incurable, she was the more ready to pittie his passions, that she promised to further him in what she could, beeing now assured of the cause of his sadnesse. How Parismenos after the knowledge of his parents, departed towards Natolia . How he met with Marcellus : and what afterwards befell to him. Within fewe daies after, Parismenos returned againe towards Natolia (but with much sorrow in the Bohemian court for his departure) spending much time in trauell, vntill he arriued at S. Austins Chappell, hauing gotten him other armour, because he would not be knowne: and knocking at the Chappell doore, presently olde Iabin came out, to whom he discouered himselfe: who knowing him, reioyced exceedingly, at his presence and safetie, desiring him to come in: for that hee had newes of importance to tell him. Parismenos comming to him for no other intent, but to heare newes from Angelica , willingly went in with him. And Iabin began as followeth. Most noble knight, I wil declare vnto you all that I haue learned of the estate of Marcellus , so neare as I can. After that you were departed from hence, the Notalians hauing continued their diligent search some three dayes, in the ende returned to the Court frustrated of their desire: whereby Maximus gaue no credence to that report, but soone forgat the same, remaining in great quiet. Marcellus by this time had recouered his health, letting passe no time, came hither, thinking to haue found you heere, but hearing by my report of your departure, he seemed to be quite ouercome with greefe, and declared vnto me all that had happened to you in the golden tower, which you had declared vnto me before: and withall, manifested what hapned vnto him and Angelica , and how he was so greeuously wounded: then Iabin declared the same, euen as Marcellus had told him, in the very same manner as is before declared, when he determined to haue conueyed Angelica to Saint Austins Chappell, the day his father was on hunting. And (quoth he) Marcellus hauing tolde me this, withall shewed me with what sorrow Angelica endured your absence. Parismenos hauing heard his words, which yeelded him full assurance of Marcellus friendship, and Angelicas constant loue, was therewith exceedingly comforted, rehearsing to him, how fortunately he had found his sparent. Iabin then began to vse him with more reuerence, and more feruently to affect his copany and good, yt at Parismenos request, hee went towards the Golden Tower, to see if he could by any meanes, to speak with Marcellus , which hee willingly at his request did, and brought newes backe, that Maximus was departed with the Queene, Marcellus and Angelica , towards the Cittie of Ephesus : which he learned of such as were gardiants at the Golden Tower. Parismenos hearing that, immediately departed thitherwards, and entring the Cittie, rode presently vnto the Court, where hee met a Knight, whome hee desired of courtesie to certifie Marcellus that there was a Knight who would speake with him: which at his request, he presently went  & performed: and finding Marcellus in the kings great hall, hee told him there was a strange knight at the Court hate that was desirous to speake with him. Marcellus maruelling who it should bee, immediately went out vnto him, being a knight of exceeding vertue, that he would not refuse any curtesie, and though he were sonne vnto a mightie King, yet he disdained not to fulfill his request, though he neither knew him, nor the cause of his comming. Parismenos beholding him, immediately allighted from his steed, and with a kinde behauiour, said. Most Noble and courteous Prince, I desire to haue some fewe words in priuate coference with you, from the knight of Fame. Marcellus hearing him name the knight of Fame , desired him to say on: for there were none present, but such as he trusted. My Lord (quoth Parismenos ) because I knowe not whether I may discouer my selfe or no with safetie, I am the knight of Fame , but now altered in name, but not in good will to you. Marcellus hearing his words, had much adoo to refraine from embracing him: but yet for that he would not haue any note the same, he abstained: but saide: Most noble knight, nothing could haue brought that ioy to my heart, your presence doth, being a long time seuered from you by Fortunes vnconstant mutabilitie, who altereth the estate of things, according to her variable disposition: trusting you haue not misdoubted of my good will, though I came not to S. Austins Chappell according to my promise: which I was about to performe, but that my intent was crost. But seeing you are thus happily returned, and haue as I hope, attained the knowledge of your parents, in whose search olde Iabin tolde me you were departed, I desire you repose that assured confidence in my trustinesse, that I will labour to procure your content euery way to my vttermost power: your safetie and returne, will bring no little ioy to my sister Angelica , which is impossible to giue her knowledge of: for my father hath now garded her more stricktly then euer before neither is she heere in this court as the common report goeth, but still remaineth in the Golden Tower, which I will declare to you hereafter. In the meane time, because you shall not be descride, I will send my Esquire with you vnto an auncient Ladies house of good estimation, where you shall be kindly entertained for my sake, whither I will repiare vnto you: where you shal, if so please you stay, vntil I can worke some meanes how to bring you, that you may speake with my sister Angelica . Parismenos hearing his courteous speeches, yeelded him most hearty thankes: and so for that Marcellus was fearfull of his fathers suspition, without any more speeches, hee sent Parismenos with the Squire vnto the Ladies house, whose name was Madame Panora: who taking Parismenos by the hand, conducted him in, and vsed him most kindly. After dinner was past, Marcellus came thither to him, thanking Panora for entertaining his friend: then hee most louingly embraced Parismenos (who by reason of his long trauell, and exceeding cares was so much altered, that had Marcellus met him in the streetes, without any former knowledge that it was hee, hee would hardly haue knowne him) who with the like behauiour greeted him againe: declaring to him his whole trauelles in search of his Parents. Marcellus hearing how that he was sonne vnto the most noble Princes Parismus and Laurana , heires of the two famous Kingdomes of Thessalie and Bohemia , said. Most noble Knight, how miserable should Natolia haue beene esteemed, if it had beene the destruction of so honourable blood, and what crueltie might haue beene imputed to my father, to haue giuen you the sentence of your death? & how vnfortunate had our blood been, in missing to be affianced to so honourable and kingly houses? but notwithstanding all this, my father too much ouerburdened with conceit, regardeth no such honour, but rather dishonoureth his house and stocke with his fearefull suspect, who since your departure from the Maiden Tower, grew into such furious conceit of Angelica , that euery day he was in a manner her keeper, and in the night hee caused her to lodge in his owne chamber, the doores whereof he would locke with his owne hands, and keepe the keyes, which was procured by the vaine surmise of a dreame, wherein he dreampt that Angelica should be stolne from him: this miserable life continued not many daies (which wel I may terme most miserable, being intangled with so many cares as I know possesse his heart) till at the last hee wrought this deuise, thinking vnder that to ease his cares, and preuent all those mischiefes which hee feared: hee gaue out speeches many daies before hee came to the Golden Tower, that he would depart to this Cittie: and withall, it was reported in euery mans voyce, that Angelica should no more be kept in that Tower, but that shee should likewise depart with him, which all the Nobles and Lords of the land were glad of, the knights & Ladies her attendants reioyced therat, & the Fame therof was soone spred throgh the hearing of bordering Nations, and so from thence to far coutries, my self amogst the rest was exceedinglie glad, especially Angelica most of all reioyced thereat. Now my father seeing the ioy was made thereat, was the more troubled in his sences, that comming to a Damozel of meane birth, yet of much bewtie, who in countenance much resebled Angelica , he woon her by (many protestations of great preferment, and with many threates of great seueritie, if she would not condiscend to follow his counsell) to do whatsoeuer he commaunded her? her did he cause to come into his owne chamber, and secretlie (without the priuitie of any but the Queene) to attire her selfe in Angelicas richest ornaments, appointing certaine Damozels to attend her, that knew not Angelica : or at least knew her not from Angelica . As for Angelica , the very same day, when he ment to depart, hee committed her to the custodie of foure Eunuches: who vowed not to let any come either to ye sight of her, or speech of her without he brought my fathers letter to that effect, signed with his owne hand and signs, remoouing all her former gardiants, and appointing new that know nothing, but that Angelica was departed with the King, from whose knowledge likewise he had giuen the Eunukes especial charge, to keep her being there. All the Ladies likewise that attended her, came away with him, knowing no other but that Anglica was in his company, leauing no other to attend her, but one Damzel named Anna which she obtained of my father with many instant intreaties. And hauing effected euery thing according to his fancie, he departed hitherwards: the Damzel so artificially behauing her selfe that neither my selfe nor any other perceiued but that it was Angelica indeed. And being arriued in this place, he committed this supposed Angelica to such strickt custodie, as before he vsed, committing her to be kept by those Damozels that indeede thought it had beene Angelica , whome hee bound by many promises, not to suffer any to come to her speech. But I longing to haue some conference with my sister, whose heart I knew was opprest with many cares for your absence, sought meanes to come to her speech, which I was long without obtaining: but at last by meanes of one of the Damozels, whom with many intreaties I had wonne, I came to her, and taking her by the hand, I began to vse many speeches to comfort her: and withall, to enter into such conference, as would haue bewrayed all the secrets that euer had passed betwixt mee, Angelica , and your selfe: but the Damozel bearing a vertuous minde, and vnwilling (as shee afterwards tolde mee) to betray my secrets to her priuitie (which could not proceed but from a meruailous good disposition) suddainly brake off my speeches, saying. My Lord, I beseech you be aduised to whom you speake, vnlesse you will commit your secrets to one that you woulde not otherwise trust, neither will I presume (being vnworthie thereof) to participate your counsels: for I am not Angelica , but your poore hand maide Dulcia . At which words I was halfe astonisht, and viewing her indeed, perfectly knew her: which without she had bewrayed her selfe, I should neuer haue done: withall, my fancie began inwardly to commend her curtesie, or rather vertue, that refused (though she condiscended to my fathers will) to betray mee, knowing the whole depth of my secrets: and woondring how mine eyes were blinded, that could before discrie her, I requested her to tell me the occasion why she supplied Angelicas roome, the truth whereof shee declared vnto mee, in manner as I haue now tolde you: withall, requesting mee vppon her knees, not to reueale that which shee hadde of dutie, good will and affection tolde mee: which I promised I would, and meane faithfully to conceale from all but your selfe. Now there resteth nothing but how to worke meanes that you may come to Angelica . Parismenos hearing how stricktly his Ladie was guarded, was suddainly stricken with silent sadnesse, to thinke of the impossibilities that hindred his content, and his minde was so opprest with care, that hee forgot how to studie for his owne auaile. Marcellus seeing him falne into that heauie dumpe, reuiued him from the same with this comfortable speech: My deare friend abandon this habit of care, and reuiue your drouping hart with hopeful comfort, for my selfe will worke meanes how you shall haue the custodie of Angelica , which I will effect very speedily, if you will stay here but while I can bring the same about. Parismenos beeing comforted with his curteous promise, gaue him thankes in these speeches. Most noble Knight, how may I expresse sufficient thankes to you, for becomming so kinde and faithfull a friend to me vnwoorthie? or which way may I recompence the least of your good deeds, that haue in all abundance tasted of your honourable bountie? for which I render you thanks, as all the recompence I am able to make: vowing if euer you neede my helpe in any thing, neuer to desist to hazard my life for your sake. And since you haue of your owne vertuous disposition voluntarily (neither drawne by intreatie nor hope of recompence) promised mee your assistance, which onely may bee the meane to worke my euerlasting felicitie, I beseech you go forwards therein, that I may thereby bee much more indebted, as well for that, as for infinit other your Princely courtesies: which though they passe vnrewarded, yet they shall neuer rest vngratified in my dutifull deuotions, which by good right are eternally bound to requite your good will. Woorthie friend (quoth Marcellus ) leaue off so to vse such thankes to mee, that request nothing at your hands but loue and friendshippe, which am vnable to merit any such recompence as you kindly yeelde: but I pray be you merrie yet in my absence, with this kinde olde Ladie, whilest I put my purpose in practise, which so soone as I haue brought to perfection, I will returne, and not before: till when, I take my leaue, committing you to your owne hearts desire, which I wish: which words being ended, with many courteous farewels hee departed the chamber: and comming to Panora , (who before had beene his Nurse, and loued him most dearely) whom he requested in most earnest sort, to vse his friend as kindly as she would vse himselfe, who promised so to do: and likewise performed it in euery vsing Parismenous so kindly, that hee could not chuse out greatly to extoll and commend her courtesie. Now let my muse returne to speake somewhat of Angelica , who after shee sawe that she was frustrated of her desire, which was to depart with the King, according as himselfe had giuen out speeches, and not to be any longer inthralled as she had of long time before been, and now perceiuing that her father had both deceiued her in that, taken away all her damzels, chaunged her guard, and appoynted her to bee guarded by such iealous slaues, as would neuer scarce day nor night suffer her to be out of their sight, thought her selfe not onely in as bad case as before, but rather in thousand times woorse, being depriued of many pleasures which she enioyed: but neuer esteemed of them, vntill now she was restrained, missing the comfortable presence and sweete conference she was woont to enioy with Marcellus , and especially fearing neuer to see the Knight of Fame again, she wholly gaue her mind to sorrowe, spending all her time commonly in teares and bewailing her sad estate, that had not Anna in some measure comforted her, she would haue ouerwhelmed her tender heart with those cares, and haue shortned the date of her precious life, thinking euery houre a day, and euery day a yeare, till she were released from that bondage: in which carefull estate she continually remained. How the Knight of Fame carried Angelica from the golden Tower, to Iabines Cappell. Assoone as Marcellus was come to the Court, hee presently got himselfe to his chamber, and there beganne to studie how to compasse that which he had vndertaken to effect: at last he bethought himselfe, that if hee could deuise any meanes to get his fathers Signet, hee would wright a letter vnto the keepers of the Maiden Tower, in the behalfe of Parismenos , that they should admit him as one of the Gardiants, which presently he contriued in this sort. chosen and appoynted to be one of your fellowes, and to that effect I haue sent him to you with this letter, signed by my selfe: whom I require you to admit without any deniall, and keepe this as your warrant to do the same. Maximus. When Marcellus had wrote this letter, and immitated therein so neare as he could his fathers hand, which hee knewe they were not greatly acquainted withall, he wrought such meanes that hee gate Maximus signet and sealed the same: which when hee had signed, the next morning he went to Parismenos and told him what he had done: who liked thereof very well, and (quoth he) if I may once be admitted amongst them, let me alone with the Eunuches to come to Angelica , neither will I be denied, since I haue this good meanes: that presently he armed himself, for that he would not vse any, not the least which oftentimes bringeth things well begun to an vntoward end: and taking his leaue of Marcellus and the Lady Panora , with abundance of heartie thankes, he departed with a merrie heart towards the maiden Tower, hoping now to enioy the sweete sight of his beloued, which hee neuer beheld but twise in all the time he had sought her loue. Marcellus he departed backe againe to the court very sadde, for the absence of Parismenos and Angelica , being likewise much greeued, that Maximus his father should withholde any of his secrets from him, which did both disgrace him to such as were strangers, and especially to those Ladies that were Dulcias attendants, which thogh he knew well inough, yet that tooke away no part of his conceit of vnkindnesse: but most of all he was troubled with griefe to be restrained from Dulcias company, on whom his thoughts had continually run, euer since he had bene last with her: for her bewtie excelled all the Ladies of the court ( Angelica excepted)  & of her vertue hee had good conceit, by that which he had found in her good dispositions, when shee refused to thrust her selfe into the knowledge of his secrets, but rather committed all that the king had commaunded her to his secrecie, which if Maximus should knowe of, would be as much as her life were worth. These cogitations so much altered his countenance, that whereas before hee was of a pleasant disposition, he now began to giue his minde wholely to melancholie sadnesse, often shunning the company of those he was wont to delight in, which Maximus noted, especially the Queene both maruelled and was greeued thereat, and finding him out when hee was in that heauie vaine, she earnestly demaunded his cause of sadnesse, to whom he made this aunswere. My father I know not vpon what occasion accounteth me I thinke, rather as one that would betray him, then as his sonne, that he restraineth me Angelicas presence, and keepeth his counsels from me: to intrude my selfe into his counsels, I will not presume: onely my desire is, that I may but be admitted to the sight of my sister Angelica . Marcellus (quoth the Queene) I pray thee bee contented for a time, for thou seest thy fathers minde, which will impart his secrets to none, who if hee should know that your sadnesse were for that cause, would be the more fearefull to impart them to you, which can no way pleasure you, but rather fill your minde wit greater cares, which now is more happie then it would be then: for Angelica so long as she is in health, what need you be so carefull for her: then good Marcellus rest your selfe contented, and desire not that which will rather adde more trouble to your head. The Queene hauing ended these speeches, departed and left Marcellus where she found him. Assoone as the Queene was gone, he began againe to ponder these things, not knowing why his head shuld be thus troubled: for he knew all that he desired, and yet his minde was troubled therewith, that at last, with more aduised consideration, he weighed euery conceit of his thoughts, and found that neither his fathers vnkindnesse, Angelicaes absence, nor his feare of disgrace, was that that troubled him, but onely a good conceit of Dulcias kindnesse, which caused him to enter into a viewe of her perfections, which his fancie began so much to commend her, that he thought her worthie to be beloued: & withal, thought why he might not loue her, which very thoghts drew to such insight into his owne fancies, that he perceiued that loue had already taken possession in his heart: then hee began to consider what displeasure it might procure him, if he should set his fancie on one so farre his inferior, and not rather seeke the loue of some kings daughter, that might [illeg.] honor to his title, and not diminish the same: which thought was no soone begun, but it ended, being dasht by an other conceit, that Dulcias was as bewtifull as any, as vertuous as any, as curteous as any: and therefore as worthy to be beloued as any: that if he should marry with his equall, she might rather marrie him for his dignitie, and of a haughtie minde to keepe her owne high dignitie still, then for any true love: and if she were his equall, he should rather bee subiect to her will, then shee any way obedient to him: that Dulcia would be a louing, kinde and dutifull wife, that she would honour him, rather then desire to bee his equall, and that she would refuse no perrill, daunger, nor hazard for his sake: that hauing spent some time in these cogitations, he resolved to loue Dulcia whatsoeuer ensued thereon: though hee incurred his parents displeasure, or any other hazard of his honour whatsoeuer: and with resolution, he went immediately vnto the place where shee was guarded in steed of Angelica , and by the damzels meanes, who before had done him the like fauour, he came to her chamber, where he found Dulcia all alone very sad, to whom he said. How now Angelica , what are you sad? can I neuer come, but that I must alwaies find you in this melancholy disposition? what, are you sorry to bee thus pend from a husband? My Lord (quoth Dulcia ) though I am otherwise sadde, it doth me good to see you so merrie. You are deceiued Dulcia , I am not merrie. My Lord (quoth she) if I should giue credite to your words, they shew that you are merrie, that call me Angelica , yet know the contrary. Oh Dulcia (quoth he) neither doth wordes nor countenance alwaies bewray the inward thoughts: for this which you take to bee mirth in me, is but a forced habit, which I haue taken vpon me euen now: but knew you the thoughts of my heart, you would say I were sad. My Lord (quoth she) I beseech you pardon my boldnesse, which I presumed, seeing your pleasant disposition, wherein if I was deceiued, I hope you will not bee offended with: for indeed oftentimes the heart meditates on many things the mind canot vtter. So doth mine Dulcia (quoth he) for I wish thee more good, then I am able to vtter: and the cause that my heart is sadde, is because I am not able to do thee so much good, as my heart doth wish and cannot vtter. I most humbly thanke you (quoth Dulcia ) acknowledging my selfe farre vnwoorthie such fauour, and vnable to deserue such good, which maketh mee thinke you still continue in that forced habit, which maketh you vttter those speeches. Indeede well replyed Dulcia (quoth he) but as I suddainly tooke that habit vpon me, it was gone again before I had vttered the words: therefore you may bee assured now, that my words proceed from a true heart, and not from a forced habit. My Lord (quoth she againe) where there is such often change of disposition, there can be no constant resolution. Yes (quoth he) that which is of purpose taken to shewe mirth, is forced: but the naturall disposition still continueth firme. In deede in fewe (quoth she) but not in all. Then (quoth he) thinke mee one of those fewe. My Lord (quoth she) I beseech you pardon me if I do not: for it is giuen to al by nature, to be more confident then prouident. And I aunswere, I haue receiued more fauour at your hands, in suffering me to bee thus familiar with you, then I am woorthie, or euer haue deserued: therefore I craue pardon, hoping that you will beare with my rudenesse. Dulcia (quoth he) do not aske pardon when you haue not misdone, but beleeue my words, without any question to proceed from the depth of my true heart, which entendeth and wisheth you no lesse good then I haue vttered: for I haue found such vertue in you, that I am inthralled to that vertue, and desire to be partaker & possesse thy bewty, which hath made mee your affectionate friende, and intreate your loue, then that which I desire nothing more. My Lord replied Dulcia , my loue and dutie is such, that I will not refuse any command you shal impose vpon me. Dulcia (quoth hee) it is not such loue as is commaunded by dutie, nor such friendship as riseth from feare, but such kinde loue as proceedeth (betwixt faithful friends) from the yeelding consent of a true heart, and such loue as hath a further respect then that common dutie: for if you knew with what feruencie I desired your sweete consent to to this loue, you would pittie my torments. My Lord (replied she) I beseech your honour do not seeke to enthrall me in loues bands, that am free, and am assured your fancie cannot like of one farre vnworthie that high fauour you speake of, but suffer me rather to continue in my peacefull estate, that esteeme my selfe farre from euer enioying such happinesse, as to be beloued of my superiour, being alreadie so farre bound vnto you in all humblenesse, that you shall not commaund me any thing that agreeth with modestie, but I will performe the same. Speake you from your heart (quoth Marcellus ?) I do my Lord (quoth she.) Then (said hee) I command you to loue me: and if that be too harsh a word, I entreate and desire you, yeeld me loue for that true loue I beare you, being such as is grounded vpon vertue, and without spot or blemish of dishonours staine, entending nothing that may disagree with your modestie, but to make you my equall, my companion, and my dearely espoused wife: therefore, do but yeelde to loue me, and thou shalt thereby expell many cares from my heart, which otherwise will encrease to my euerlasting torment. Oh my Lord (quoth Dulcia ) I beseech you account me one that will endeuour in all dutie to deserue that honour you entend me, which I see so many impossibilities to hinder, that it quite discourageth mee from the least hope of that felicitie. So you will loue me, I care not for impossibilities, neither shall any miserie alter my constant resolution. With that, he embraced her in his armes, who gaue a silent consent intermingled with teares, proceeding from her tender heart: with whom Marcellus staied some time, spending the time in many friendly conferences, that Dulcia was constrained by his entreaties, and her owne yeelding heart, to giue her consent: both their intents being grounded vpon no other purpose, but that which is vertuous and chaste. Parismenos being departed from Marcellus , soone arriued at the maiden Tower, where hee alighted, and comming to the gardiants that kept the gate, he saluted them with a curteous behauiour, & tolde them, that he was sent by Maximus their King, to be one of the gardiants, whom at the first they denied him: then he deliuered his Letter, which they hauing red, accepted him for one of their fellowes, without any doubt or mistrust. When he had obtained his desire in this, with such prosperous successe, he began to comfort himself with hope of further good fortune, continuing all that night amongst the rest of the gardiants, & not once offering any behauiour which might breed suspition: but behaued himselfe most carefully, both in all his words and deeds, as hee had a good reason: for that they were very circumspect, and almost by reason of the strickt charge the king had giuen them, readie to suspect each other. All the next day continued he in that sort, without meeting any of the Eunuches: but on the third day, he met two of them togither in a place most conuenient, and saluted them most kindly, who maruelling what he should be, for that he was a stranger, began presently to be iealous of him: but he perceiving the same, tolde them, that hee had a secret message vnto them from the king: withal, a letter vnder his hand and signet to the gardiants, which he shewed them. But to you (quoth he) the King hath sent me with this message, that you shall admit me at al times to Angelicas presence, whom you haue the custodie off, though vnknowne to any but your selues: which he tolde me likewise, he gaue you a speciall charge to conceale from the rest of the gardiants, and hath vppon the trust he hath reposed in me, giuen me authoritie with you to haue her custodie. The Eunuches hauing heard his message, and withall, the kings priuie seale to the Letter, written in his behalfe, could not chuse but giue credece to the same, supposing that none was priuie to Angelicas being there but the king, that they made no doubt but that he was sent by him: but would not trust him, vntill they had consulted with the rest of their fellowes: to whom they declared the truth of all he had told them, who in generall admitted him to their societie. Parismenos thought himselfe most happie to haue attained this felicitie, where likewise he behaued himself most carefully, telling them that hee had a message of secrecie to declare to her from the King, which they made no doubt of, not neuer denied. When he spied his fittest opportunitie, which was, when Angelica was walking alone in a priuate garden, being all the libertie she had, and the Eunuches were gone to disport themselues, and had put him alone in trust with the key that conducted to her chamber, he vnlocked the doore, and shutting the same againe, he came to her chamber, where he durst not be so bolde as enter, before he had knockt. Anna being alone in the chamber, hearing one knocke, came to the doore: and espying Parismenos in Armor, with his sword girt to his side (which he neuer left off, being in euery point armed but his head) maruelled what he shuld be: to whom he said. Faire Damozel, maruell not to see me in Armor, which shal neuer offend you, but still be imployed in your defence. I haue knockt, presuming no further without licence: the cause of my comming so, to deliuer a message vnto the Lady Angelica from Marcellus . All this time, Anna had diligently beheld him: perswading her selfe, she had seene him before, that she made him this answere. Sir knight, if you come from Marcellus you shall bee welcome to my Lady: therefore I pray you come in, and I will conduct you to the place where she is. Then she brought him down a paire of stayres, into the garden where Angelica was: who sate at the farther end thereof, in a most heauie and discomfortable sort, seeming to be quite giuen ouer to sorrow, leaning her elbowe vpon her knees, and her head vpon her hand, with her backe towards them, and hearing them comming behinde her, with a suddaine start raised her selfe from her seate, wherewith her heart panted within her: and Parismenos humbling himselfe vpon his knee, said. Muse not diuine Lady, to behold the mappe of sorrow, created to endure euerlasting miserie: the most worthie knight Marcellus hath sent me hither, whose fauour hath caused me to be thus bold, who hartily saluteth himselfe to you by me. Angelica all this while diligently beheld him, oft changing her countenance, being procured by the diuersitie of thoughts: for she supposed it should be the Knight of Fame , for that hee came from Marcellus : but he was so mightily altered, that she was in doubt thereof. Assoone as he had ended those fewe words, shee said: Are you not the knight of Fame ? I am the same most deare Lady (quoth he) with that her heart leapt for ioy, and shee tooke him most louingly by the hand, desiring him to arise, saying: I am glad to see you againe, which I feared I should neuer haue done. Then presentlie procured by ioy for his sight, and griefe to thinke of her owne bondage, a floud of Christall teares issued from her eyes: which attainted his heart with extreame grief, that he stood like a man senselesse, and cofounded in his thoughts: and such passions opprest her heart, that she was scarce able to vphold her selfe from falling, which caused the water with violence drawne from his manly heart, stand in his eyes, which neuer before by no accident were assent: and seeing her in that wofull estate, could not chuse but folde his arme with a fearefull touch about her slender waste to vphold her, whilest Anna ran for some comfortable water to reuiue her withall: but comming to her selfe againe, she leant her head in his bosome, who put his hand betwixt her precious temples, to keepe it from touching his colde and hard Armour, vttering these speeches. Oh how vnfortunate am I, that by my disquiet haue procured you this disquiet: but before he could say more, she answered: But were you hence, my griefe would be far greater. It is not your presence hath done this, but my owne hearts cares that are still allotted to be my greatest comfort: but thinke your selfe most welcome to me, and your presence more delightfull then any others whatsoeuer. Most vertuous Lady (quoth he) your kindnesse is so farre beyond my desert, that I know my selfe altogither vnable to render sufficient thankes for, which I haue beene often made acquainted withall, by the worthie Marcellus , and now finde kindlie ratified by your owne heauenlie voyce, which yeelde mee that vndeserued fauour as shall binde me in all dutifull bonds of seruice to your command. If (quoth she) I should do otherwise then loue you, you might account me discourteous: or if I should denie my words past to Marcellus (who loueth you so wel, that he wil I know conceale nothing from you) you might account me vntrue: but seeing you haue well deserued the one, and are by his meanes made priuie to the other, I cannot now stand vpon new termes of deniall, but yeelde my self in all honorable sort into your custodie. Most sweet Lady (quoth he) if I prooue not thankfull, heauen grant my good deeds may bee rewarded with ill: if I remaine not euerlastinglie true, let comfort hate my soule, the earth denounce my bodie, and terror afflict my conscience: if euer I refuse perill, hazard of life, torment, or other miserie for your sake, let all peril, hazard of life, torment and miserie be my chiefest comfort: if my loue continue not constant, my faith firme, and my thoughts cleare of disloyaltie, let those I loue hate me: let all men abhorre me: and euery creature seeke my destruction. Gentle Knight (quoth shee) your words I do constantly beleeue: therefore be you assured likewise of my resolution, which is to rest my selfe wholely vpon your vertues: with that they parted so pure a maiden kisse betwixt them, beeing the first that euer she had giuen or he receiued, that both their hearts seemed to enterchange the others place, and to part from their louing brest with a soft breathing sigh, more sweete then if all the vnited perfumes in the world had bene met betwixt their rosiate lips. By this time Anna was returned, hauing spent her labour in vaine, for that Angelica was safe. Then Parismenos taking her by the arme, led her vp into her lodgings, which when he had done, Angelica desired him to declare by what meanes he had attained that libertie to come to her. And he said, I am amongst the rest, one of your keepers: for behold I haue the key that alone conducteth to your lodging: ye Eunuches haue put me in trust withall, who are now gone about some recreation they haue in hand: then he declared vnto her the truth of all, and of Maximus pollicie, and how he had caused Dulcia to supplie her roome at the Court, who was of euery degree taken for her selfe. Angelica hearing his report, forced a smile from her carefull hart, which she had not done many a day before. Desiring him likewise to declare his trauels after he had escaped out of the Lyons den, which hee did in euery respect. When Angelica heard that he was sonne to Parismus and Laurana , whose Fame resounded in euery place, and that he was sproong of two such kinglie houses, her heart was filled with exceeding ioy: which she exprest by giuing him many kind welcomes: vttering these speeches. My deare knight (quoth she) I reioyce to heare that you haue found your princelie parents. But yet I would you had kept the same from my knowledge as yet, because that you might haue had tryall of my good will in your vnknowne estate, in which you were as deare to me as you shall be if you were the highest Monarch of the world. But how happie should I be, if I might in quiet enioy your presence, which I know not how you will effect. Deare Lady (quoth he) there resteth nothing but your consent: which if you vouchsafe to grant, then I doo not doubt but soone to bring you out of this place without any hazard of your person. Oh sweete Parismenos , the thraldome I haue long endured, maketh me desirous of libertie, that am almost tired with conceit of my fathers credulitie, too much addicted to vaine reports: especially relying vpon your vertuous disposition, and desirous to be ruled and gouerned by your wisedome, whom I haue chosen for my onely delight: I am most willing to do whatsoeuer you shall counsell me too, resting in assured confidence, that you will no way impaire my honor, which I respect more then my life: but rest at my disposition in seeking any other assurance then my promise. I beseech you (quoth he) let no euil conceit of me take place in your heart, but be assured, that so long as I breathe, I will not erre from your command, in the least vndutifull respect, but rest so fully and wholely obedient to your behests, that sooner then I will do or thinke a thought that shall disagree to your desire, this breath shal leaue my brest, and my vitill spirits giue vp their latest gaspe. After these speeches ended, and Angelicas minde fully satisfied, they spent some time in familiar conference intermingled with many kinde behauiours, to the further conformation of both their loues: till at last, Parismenos enforced, in regard of their safeties, departed to his charge, whither he was come before they were returned: and at their returne finding him there, they made no doubt of him, but tooke the charge vpon them againe, entring into Angelicas chamber, to prouide her such things as were necessarie, who because they should not finde any alteration, put on her former manner of sadnesse, which before proceeded from the depth of care, but now she assumed to auoide suspition. Parismenos he went downe amongst the rest of the knights that kept the Castle, keeping companie sometimes with them, and sometimes with the Eunuches, that neither of them knew of his familiaritie with the other, but both accepted him as one of their company, that hee had the garding of the entrance into the castle, and also the secret keeping of Angelica , with the Eunuches: neither of them both suspecting his intent. Thus continued he amongst them some three dayes, in which time he came often to Angelica , and had conference with her: at last his turne came, that he must both watch with one of the Eunuches, and also at the Castle entrance, where likewise, neuer but two kept the watch, which fell out according to Parismenos desire: whose hart was much troubled to effect this businesse, deuising how he should bee rid of his two fellowes, the Eunuch and the other, that kept the entrance, being vnwilling to be esteemed a murderer, his hands being yet neuer guiltie of bloud: at last his desire to get Angelica from thence, ouercame that care, and he resolued rather to be their executioner, then bee disappointed of his intent: when the time that he should take his place to watch was come, and he and the Eunuch alone, the rest being gone to their lodging, Parismenos being in talke with the Eunuch suddenly mufled him in his gowne, so close, that none could heare him crie, and thrust his sword quite through him, which hee did with such expedition, that his fellowes neuer heard their noyse, and taking the keye from him, tooke him vnder his arme and floong him into a darke corner of the Tower. When he had done this, he hasted to his other place of charge: where when he came, he found his fellow watch-man staying for him, but fast a sleepe with the keyes of the Castle gate lying by him: whom Parismenos caught in his armes, and before he could recouer his sences, threw him from the battlements, into the lake, where he was drowned: which done, he went backe to Angelicas chamber, and opening the doore, entred in, and found Angelica in her bed fast a sleepe, whom was in minde at the first to haue awaked her, but beholding her in so sweete a slumber, the awfull regard he bare to her would not suffer him to be so bolde, but still he stood by her a good space, beeing desirous to awake her, yet fearefull to disturbe her quiet rest: at last, Anna awaked, who continually was her bedfellow. Who seeing Parismenos in the chamber at that vnseasonable houre, styrring her selfe to speake to him, awaked Angelica , who likewise casting her eye suddenly on him, was somewhat agast at his being there, but hee kneeling downe by her beds side, said: Pardon me I beseech you this boldnesse, now is the time that you may depart, and without any let or molestation, for that my selfe haue alone the keeping of the entrance into this Tower. Angelica hearing his speeches, tolde him she would presently be readie: then Anna suddenly started out of the bed and apparelled her selfe. And Parismenos arising withdrew himselfe. Angelica likewise made such expedition, that she was readie before Parismenos wisht, hauing attired her selfe with most exceeding rich Ornaments. Then shee came to him and saide. Now deare friende, let vs goe when you please: then he tooke her by the one arme, and Anna by the other, saying: be of good comfort and feare not, for I dare assure you to passe with quiet. After they were out of the chamber he lockt the doore againe and tooke the key with him: and from thence, led her downe to the Tower gate: and being without, fast lockt the same againe after them. And being quite without the conpasse of the Tower, Angelicas heart seemed to leape within her for ioy, demaunding in most kinde sort, whither he would conuey her, for (quoth shee) if I should be taken againe, and come to Maximus presence, my torment and griefe would be more then I am able to expresse. I haue (quoth he) a friend not farre hence, in whose trust I durst repose any secret, whither I will conduct you with safetie: therefore, I beseech you be of good comfort. Many a wearie steppe Angelica had, before she came to her iournies ende: which at last they attained. When they were come to Saint Austins Chappell, Parismenos neuer left knocking vntill he had awaked Iabin , who maruelling to heare one knocke at that time of the night, much maruelled, and comming to the doore, demaunded before he would open the same, who was there. Parismenos made aunswere, good friends Iabin , open the doore, here is none but friends. With that Iabin knowing his voice, opened the doore and let them in, with all haste lighting a Taper, then hee came to Parismenos and embraced him: but not knowing Angelica , but supposing it was she, admiring her exceeding bewtie, with humble reuerence he desired her to accept of his poore Cell: where Angelica being wearie, seated her self vpon his bed, being most glad that she was escaped out of the maiden Tower, where they spent some time in conference about their escape: when Parismenos at her request, declared the manner how he rid himselfe from those that were appointed to watch with them. Whose wisedome Angelica greatlie admired. After many of these sweete remembrances past betweene them, Angelica and Anna fell fast a sleepe, being wearie of their trauell: which Parismenos and Iabin seeing, they departed into the Chappell to confer about their securitie: where we will leaue them, to speake of the gardiants. How Maximus had knowledge of Angelicas escape. How Marcellus with Dulcia fled from the court at Ephesus . And how Marcellus in Portellus Armor came to S. Austins chappell. And how Parismus sent Portellus into Bohemia . In the morning the Eunuches according to their woonted manner, came to the place where they thought to haue found their fellowes, but missing them both, first maruelling thereat,  & afterwards conceiuing the woorst, beeing apt to suspition, knockt at Angelicas chamber doore, but none made aunswere: which draue them into an exceeding perplexitie of feare, then they bega al togither to studie what this might mean, & going down, they espied their fellow lie dead before them, whom Parismenos had cast there, that Angelica might not see him: which ghastlie sight affrighted them with deadlie feare: that with an exceeding outcrie they ran downe to the Knights that kept the entrance: who maruelling at their sorrow, enquired the cause thereof: they declared how they found one of their fellowes slaine, and the knight that Maximus had lately sent was missing. He (quoth the knights) hath the keeping of the entrance: but notwithstanding, some of them fearing the woorst, ranne thither, where they found neither him, nor the other knight that was appointed to watch with him, nor the keyes of the Tower gate. With which news, they returned backe to the rest of their fellowes, who by this time came all togither. At which newes, one of them said: I see no such cause of sorrow. With that one of the Eunuches said: you know not what wee haue lost, we are all vndone: we shall all be hanged, if Maximus heare hereof, we haue lost Angelica : with yt the knights burst into a laughter. Oh (quoth the Eunuch) laugh not at that which will bring vs all to sorrow, we haue lost Angelica , whose custodie we had, though vnknowne to you: which the King commanded vs to keepe from your knowledge, for that he had giuen out report, that she was departed with him: whom I feare me, the straunge knight that lately arriued heere, hath carried away from vs all. The knights hearing his words, were exceedingly amazed thereat, which they were assured were true, by the rest of his fellowes. Then they went all togither vp to Angelicas chamber, and breaking open the doore, they found her not, but wel perceiued that she was gone. Then began the Eunuches to roare and crie out like mad men, and the knights ran downe like men transformed into amazement: at last, with much adoo they opened the gate, finding the drawne bridge let downe: and some of them hauing horse within the Tower, posted euery way about the countrie, making diligent search and enquirie after them, and many of them met with olde Iabin , who answered them that he sawe none such, whom they all credited, for that he was a man of religion, which were of most high estimation with euery one in those Countries, that they esteemed euery word that past their lips, as true Oracles: by which meanes Parismenos and Angelica were as safe in his custodie as could be deuised. Iabin seeing such a number of knights abroad, returned with that newes to his Cell, which draue Angelica into some feare and disquiet, but Iabin by his comfortable assurances, expeld the same from her heart, by telling her, that if all the world were in search of them, yet they would neuer suspect that place. The Eunuches soone got out of the Tower, and fled for feare of Maximus furie, euery man which way he thought best for his owne safetie. One of the knights posted with all speed to the Court, and comming into Maximus presence, declared the whole circumstance of this tragicall euent. Which when Maximus heard, he tore his haire, stamped on the earth, raged and railed most exceedingly, calling all the Nobles and Knights of his Court togither, commaunding them in all haste to arme themselues presently, and be in redinesse to go with him, and to stay for him at the Court gate: then might you see Noblemen making haste, some this way, some an other way, some calling for the rest of their armour, hauing the one halfe on, and the other out of redinesse: some in armor, readie mounted, buckling on their Helmets, others at euery point armed, calling for their steedes, som ready mounting, halfe armed, halfe vnarmed: Knights running this way, seruants that way, all stirring and making vnwoonted hast, and euery one in a hurly burly. By this time came Maximus ready mounted, girding his spurs into his steeds side for haste: who was readie to make speede without spurring, commaunding his knights to follow him: who hasted after him, not knowing why they made such speede, the Ladies wondred at this newes, some for feare of their husbands harme, for they thought some enemies were approached which might endager their persons, admiring this strange accident: some bemoning the absence of their louers: all in a wonderfull extasie, the Queene shee sate weeping for the losse of her daughter which the King had told her of. Marcellus he onely reioiced, for that he supposed Parismenos had caried fro thece Ange. Maximus with al haste arriued at the maide tower, where he heard the truth of all, and sawe the Eunuch that was slaine, and withall was certified in what manner the straunge knight came, and how that he brought with him a Letter signed with his priuie signet. When Maximus heard this, he grew presently into a perswasion that it was the vnknowne knight had done that exployt, and carried away Angelica , then he called for the Letter which one of those knights (by ill fortune more carefull then the rest, had demaunded of Parismenos , after he had shewen the same to the Eunuches as aforesaid) deliuered vnto him, which when Maximus sawe, he presently knew that it was Marcellus hand, which caused his eyes to swel with rage, that for that the night was now come, he rested in the Tower, commaunding and desiring his Nobles and Knights to poste throughout all the Country to finde Angelica , commaunding two of the chiefest of his Noble men early the next morning to poste to the Court and apprehend Marcellus as a Traytor, for conspiring with a straunger to betray his life. Thus on a suddaine was all the Countrey spred ouer with knights, who left no place of likelihood to harbour them. Onely Iabins Cell they suspected not, which was so neare the Mayden Tower, and withall a place of holinesse and religion dedicated to Saint Austin , whom they worshipped: that of all places none of the thought of likelihood that they should be there: in which quest they continued very earnest all that night, and the next day. Assoone as Marcellus sawe all the Knights and Nobles departed, and all the Court in an vprore, now fearing that if Maximus should see the Letter hee had giuen Parismenos , hee would knowe his hand: when all were in an exceeding vprore, he came to Dulcia in great hast, and tolde her al that had befallen, telling her, that he must now for a time leaue her: for that he knew his father would vppon sight of the Letter be so much incenst against him, that it were meere fondnesse in him to stay and abide his furie: with that Dulcias heart panted with griefe, and her eyes melted into teares, desiring him most humbly vpon her knees, that he would not leaue her behinde, whose life would be worse then death without his presence: for my Lord (quoth shee) if you will vouchsafe me this fauour, I will neuer forsake you for feare of any miserie, perill or torment. Marcellus tooke her vp with a kinde kisse, telling her that hee was most exceedingly glad that she would go with him, being the onely thing he most desired in the world. Then (quoth Dulcia ) tell me what I shall do, and I will do it presently. (Quoth he) whilest I hold the Ladies in a talke, whose wits are now troubled, disguise your selfe, and slip out amongst them, and go to Madam Panoras house, and there stay for me. Dulcia then presently cast off her vppermost garments and put on some of the Ladies, such as she next found, and locking fast her chamber doore, went through amongst the thickest of them: who seeing her locke the doore tooke her for one of their fellowes that had brought Angelica to bed: and so let her passe without suspition. Dulcia was no sooner downe staires, but she hasted with all speed vntill she was without the court gate, and from thence came to Panoras house, where she was let in by Panora , whom she tolde, yt Marcellus had sent her thither, and would himselfe be there presentlie. Panora for his sake gaue her kinde entertainment. Marcellus seeing all things fall out thus prosperously, and Dulcia past by, which he noted, he left the Ladies, and presently went to his chamber, and armed himselfe in one of the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian knights armors, hauing none of his own, & wet to Panoras house, where he found Dulcia , and caught her in his armes with a louing embrace: and being all three togither, he declared to Panora all that had hapned, both of himselfe, Angelica , and Dulcia , and that the Knight which lodged in her house, was the Knight of Fame. Parismenos withall, requesting her secrecie and ayde, to conceale Dulcia from all knowledge of her beeing there, where himselfe stayed all that night: And the next day spending his time in much pleasure and kinde sort with Dulcia , whome hee loued most exceedingly, but without any blemish or thought of intemperancie. Earlie in the morning came the the two Nobles from Maximus to arrest Marcellus , thinking to haue found him there, but comming to his chamber, he was not there, nor in all the Court to be found. Which caused an other tumult for his absence, yt all had their minds so busied with coceit of meditatio why he shuld be fled, yt they were all in a second amazement therwith, though none at al knowing why he was fled, nor knowing what offence he had committed: the Queene likewise, made great sorrow for his mishap. This newes being come to the Ladies that attended Dulcia , in stead of Angelica who thought to carrie the report of this newes to Angelica , but enquiring for the key of her chamber, could not heare of it: for euery one made aunswere they hadde it not, then beganne a controuersie amongst them, enquiring who it was that came out last, but the truth thereof they could not learne, that they began to suspect each other, and that she that had the key had lost the same, and would not bee knowne thereof: that at last they began to knocke first softly, and then hard, but none made answere, which draue them all into an extreame perplexitie, and with much adoo, to rid themselues of that fear, they got open the doore, where at their comming they could not finde Angelica , but found some of her ornaments, cast in the middest of the flore: that then with wringing their hands, tearing their haire, and renting their ornaments, they made such an outcrie and exclamation, that all the Court roong thereof: which caused the Queene, the Nobles, and almost all the whole court gather to that place, where the Queene being come, and knowing the cause of their sorrow, sate downe amogst them, opprest with care, and vttered these speeches. Peace, peace, giue ouer this vaine lamentation, for you know not for whom you mourne, it was not Angelica you had the custodie of, therefore cease your laments, and giue me leaue to mourne, that haue iust cause: who am a partie in all these woes, that at once haue lost the company of both my deare children, and all procured by Maximus misdoubt, who left Angelica in the maiden Tower, who is stolen from thence, and now my sonne Marcellus with Dulcia is likewise fled. Ay me, what sorrow is this? whose griefe may bee compared to mine? was euer any so miserable as I am made, that at one instant haue lost my comfort, my children, my ioyes and delight? with that such a passion of grief ouerwhelmed her heart, that her speech abruptlie brake off, and more she would haue said but could not, that the ladies tooke her vp, being fallen into a deadlie trance, and conueyed her to her bed. Thus was the whole Court and Citie repleate with care, euery one vttering their fancies: the yoonger sort accusing Maximus of crueltie, alleaging that he was cause of those cares: the elder condemning the two young Princes of lewdnesse and lightnesse, that would enter into these actions without their parents consent. And two Noblemen returned againe to Maximus with these newes, which added newe cares to his troubled head, yt Angelicas escape did not so much greeue him, as that Marcellus should both be, Author in her escape, and also would make so base a choyse of Dulcia , with whom, all were assured he was fledde, neither did all these so much vexe him, as that hee was disappoynted of all meanes to reuenge these wrongs. Maximus continued many daies at the maiden Tower, calling togither all the knights of the land, commaunding them to make all diligent search, and to appoynt some that should stay in euerie place of the countrie, and examine euerie passenger, for that his minde gaue him, Angelica and Marcellus were within [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulia . This businesse was so speedily and so exactly performed, that it was impossible for them to escape vnknowne or undescried. Marcellus the next night after all the tumults, hauing by many perswasions and intreaties wonne Dulcia to stay with Panora , and with promise of his speedie returne, armed himselfe in the armour hee had gotten and departed from thence, with intent to go to Saint Austines Chappell, where hee was sure hee should heare of Parismenos , and by the way met with many of the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian knights, who knewe him not but by his armour, tooke him to bee a [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian knight named Portellus , whose armor Marcellus had put on: this Portellus was a knight of the kings Court, who not long since was departed into Libia without the knowledge of any but Marcellus , who had sent him to view Venolas beautie, and to learne if he could the originall of that accusation was laide against the knight of Fame , in whose armour Marcellus past without suspition, being taken of all for Portellus . Early the next morning he arriued at S. Austines Chappel, where he would neither knocke nor enter, vntill he was sure there were none to descrie him. When Iabin first sawe him, his heart was tormented with feare, demanding what he would haue. Feare not Iabin (quoth he) I am your friend Marcellus : with that he entred into the Chappel, whom Iabin would not suffer to go further, vntill hee had seene his face, which when he beheld, he embraced him most louingly, & without speaking a word brought him into his Cell, where was Parismenos, Angelica , and Anna , who all at once beholding him, and hee them, embraced each other with exceeding ioy, beeing so glad they had met, that Angelica wept for ioy, Parismenos surfetted with delight, and Marcellus heart was filled with exceeding content: when these stormes of ioy were past and somewhat calmed, Marcellus declared to them all that had happened, and how that Maximus had set most diligent spies in euerie corner of the countrie, and withall, declared the cause why he was fledde, the maner and with whom, his loue to Dulcia , how he had left her with Panora , and how happily hee had passed vnsuspected in Portellus armour, which when they heard, they all applauded and reioyced at his fortunate successe: to whom Angelica said with a merrie countenance: Dulcia hath lost nothing by assuming my name and habit, but thereby hath wonne a constant knights loue, and may hereafter by that meanes come to be a Queene. Indeed Marcellus whatsoeuer other may say, I perswade and assure my selfe, you haue gotten a vertuous, beautifull, chaste, kinde, and louing Ladies loue, whose good parts I haue often commended in my secret thoghts, but now am glad that I haue so good opportunitie to speake of them in your hearing: what though shee bee not of kingly race, her vertues are such as may beseeme the best Ladie in the world. Marcellus was glad to heare Angelica so much commend his beloued Dulcia , that he said: Indeed sister I haue chosen Dulcia , I loue her, and will heereafter be true to her, for her beautie, vertue, and good parts, do please me so much, that if I liue to enioy the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian crown, she shall be my Queen: withal, I am glad you haue met your knight, of whose companie I am sure you are not a little glad. With that Angelica blusht, and hee saide: Nay sister blush not, for hee hath better deserued your loue, then Dulcia hath mine. In these and such like communications, they spent the rest of that day, studying and deuising what might bee their best course to take in these troublesome affaires. After that Marcellus had stayed some time with Parismenos and Angelica in Saint Austines Chappell, he againe departed in Portellus armour towards Dulcia , where hee arriued to her exceeding comfort, without suspition, wishing that she had beene with Angelica , that he might haue enioyed both her and their companie togither. After Marcellus was departed, Parismenos and Angelica beganne to studie which way they might escape Maximus crueltie, being both desirous to go into Bohemia , but they knew not how to passe without being discouered, for that the king still continued his diligent search: and besides, if that let had not beene, yet the iournie was so long and daungerous, that Parismenos was vnwilling to indaunger her person and health thereby, that he was drawne to an exceeding astonishment what were best to bee done: that being vnskilfull of themselues what to determine off, they asked olde Iabines counsell, who presently tolde them, that if they liked his simple fare, and that homely Cell, where though they were not daintily serued, yet they were quiet, that he thought it their best course to stay there still vntill Maximus were out of hope to finde them, and had giuen ouer his search, or at the least vntill Marcellus were returned, whose counsell they both allowed and followed. Maximus still remained in the maiden Tower, fretting his heart with vexation and griefe, beeing put out of all comfort by his Knights that daily returned without any newes, that in the ende he was tyred with griefe, and fared like one in a desperate estate: but by the counsel of his Nobles, after much trouble and long search, he returned to the Court where the Queene was, to comfort her: who at his comming he found very sicke, and in very weake estate, being procured by the greefe she had conceiued for her childrens losse. Maximus seeing her in that dangerous estate, began to comfort her with many perswasions: but she was so impatient and so full of greefe, that she vttered these speeches. Comfort my Lord, commeth now out of season, when our greefes are past remedie, which you might haue salued when time serued: it is your curiositie and too fond suspect, that hath bred these mischances, you giue too much credit to that fowle enchauntresse speeches, which your self desire to prooue true, or else you would neuer take those cruell courses you haue done with your children. Might you not often haue married Angelica according to your desire, to many honourable and great personages? what if she be now married, can that indaunger your life, vnlesse you will bee the wilfull actor thereof your selfe: but by your seueritie you haue done this, which is now impossible to be recouered. Maximus heart at these speeches began to melt with lenitie, and his owne conscience began to condemne himselfe, that now he repented the seueritie he had vsed, and accused himselfe of follie, to giue such credit to the enchauntresse speeches, that he protested if he had his children againe, he would not restraine them so much of their libertie, but that he would let them make choise according to their owne fancies: and in this heauie estate we will leaue him: deuising what meanes to worke by gentlenesse to call them home againe. Marcellus all this while continued with Dulcia in Panoras house, and now hearing that Maximus was returned from the maiden Tower, and had giuen ouer search, as hopelesse to finde either Angelica or him: he determined to conuey Dulcia to Saint Austins Chappell, for that Panoras house was too neare the Court, and there they might by ill fortune soone be descried, that with this resolution hee came to Dulcia , and made her acquainted with his purpose, whom he knew before would be wholely ruled by him: he did the like to Panora , and the next night he caused Dulcia somewhat to disguise her selfe, and meete him at Saint Martins gate, where hee would stay for her: for that if hee should carrie a Lady behinde him through the Cittie, hee thought hee should haue beene suspected. Dulcia most warily and carefully executed his businesse, which fell out so fortunately, that according to both their desires and Marcellus appointment, they met at the gate. And Marcellus hauing mounted her behinde him, with a ioyfull heart rode towards the Chappell, where likewise, according to his desire hee arriued, which brought no little ioys to Angelicas heart, that at the first, with courteous embrasings, and after with pleasant conference, they entertained that delightfull content, of enioying each others presence. Iabins Cell was now so full of guests, that it could scarce conteine them, that if they had staied there long, it wold haue beene more like a prison, then a place of content. It happened the next morning, that Iabin went to make prouision for his guests, and by the way met with Portellus , who was lately returned from Libia , and comming to the Court and not finding Marcellus , whom he loued most dearely, hee had wandred in a sollitary, sad, and heauie disposition, vp and downe all the last day and that night: and now espying olde Iabin , he came to him, and knowing him, he said. Iabin , the time hath bene, when [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulia exceeded in royaltie: but now all things is turned vpside downe. Marcellus was wont to vse your company, but now no man knoweth where hee is: would I were but with him, then my cares would be past. Why (quoth Iabin ) what might I call your name, that know me, and are desirous to finde Marcellus ? My name (quoth he) is Portellus. Iabin hearing his name, well remembred that he had often heard Marcellus desire that he were with him, said: Portellus , come along with me, and I will bring you to one that can tell you where Marcellus is: with that, they departed backe to the Chappell, where Iabin entered, & told Marcellus that Portellus was without: who hearing his speeches, ran vnto him and embraced him, and brought him in, whom Angelica likewise knew and welcommed. Then Parismenos, Marcellus and Portellus , giuing no delay to the necessitie of time and businesse they had in hand, began to consult what to doo, where euery one gaue their seuerall opinions, but could agree vpon nothing: at last, they called Iabin to theyr counsell, whose wisedome had much auailed them: who presently hauing such a determination in his minde before, counselled them to send Portellus into Bohemia , with Letters from Parismenos vnto his father, to request his aide, and to send a band of souldiers to defend him from Maximus crueltie. This counsell was exceedingly well liked of all: especially Portellus was exceedingly willing to go about that businesse, that presently furnishing himselfe with horse and armor, hauing a letter to that effect from Parismenos , and the Iewel which Laurana knew him by, which hee desired Portellus to deliuer vnto his mother, as an assured token, that he came from him. He hasted withall speede about his businesse, and soone arriued in Bohemia , and deliuered his Letter and the Iewell to Laurana . The newes of Portellus comming, was soone knowne in the Court, and the cause why he came: which when the Nobles and Commons heard, Parismus needed not muster vp men, for euery one were desirous to be employed, and came voluntarie and offered their seruice, accounting it a dishonour to be refused: and within a short space, there were gathered togither of Nobles, Knights, and Gentlemen, a great number, and to them Parismus added so many, that there were twentie thousand horsemen in a readinesse, vnder the conduct of Pollipus , who was most desirous of that honour, and had gotten Violettas consent: who with all haste marched towards [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulia. Parismus then gathered togither an Armie of fiftie thousand expert souldiers vnder his conduct and Tellamors , who was lately arriued at the Bohemian Court with Clarina . How Maximus found out Angelica with the rest, at Saint Austins Chappell, and bannisht Marcellus , imprisoned Angelica and Dulcia , and cast Parismenos into a dungion: condemning him to be burnt, where he was ready to be famished. And how afterwards he escaped out, and met with Pollipus . While these things were acting in Bohemia, Parismenos with Angelica , and Marcellus with his sweete Loue Dulcia , remained in great safety and content, being voide of feare to be now descried: seeing they had remained there in safetie in all those troubles, and beeing pend within that little roome, were desirous of some recreation: and in an euening when they thought none were stirring, they went out of the Cell into a sweete Groue, hard adioyning therto, where they walked vp and downe, and at last, Parismenos taking Angelica aside, vnto a pleasant banke, bedeckt with many sweet summer flowers, and Marcellus likewise Dulcia , rested themselues not farre from them, recreating themselues with sweete embracings. Parismenos had no sooner seated himselfe, but Angelica sate downe on his left knee, clasping her right arme about his necke, with a kinde and sweete gesture, hiding her other in his manlie bosome, which was vnbuttoned by reason of the heate, first, making many kisses a Prologue to her speech, she said. My louing Knight, how happy should we be, if we were in Bohemia , from the suspition of my father? and how great shuld our pleasure be, if we might enioy this happinesse without feare: but since we cannot attaine that blessednesse, and are hindred from it by many dangers. let vs yet reioyce each in others company, which I account a ioy without compare: and a felicitie exceeing all felicities. Most vertuous, kinde, and deare Lady (quoth he) how much fortunate am I to enioy such exceeding fauour as you vouchsafe mee? without the least merit, that haue refused no danger for my sake, that haue forsaken your parents fauour to yeeld me comfort: and most of al that are contented, nay rather pleased with the fearefull and sollitary estate for my vnworthy sake, that haue neuer bin meritorious, and that can neuer recompence such exceeding kindnesse. Parismenos (quoth she) miserie with your company is my pleasure: sollitarinesse when I enioy you, is more pleasant then all the delightfull pleasure in Kings Courts: and without, I account all pleasure paine, al company tedious, and all pompe exceeding pennurie. In these and many other such like speeches, sweete embrasings, and superabundant ouerflowing of sweet content, they recreated themselues, vntill olde Iabin came to them, and they departed togither to their Cell. Now it happened (according to the vnfortunate resolution of hard destinie) that one of the Eunuches that before was Angelicas keeper, being fled from the Mayden Tower, after Angelica was missing for feare of Maximus displeasure, which he knew well could be no lesse then death, was hidden in that wood, where he had euer since his flight shrowded him, liuing vpon such foode as the place yeelded: which was wilde fruite, and by most euil fortune) laie close in a heape of thicke bushes, and heard Parismenos and Angelicas speeches, and knew them, and at their departure secretly followed them vnto S. Austins Chappell, where after he sawe they were entred, with all speed that might be he hasted towards the Citie, and in the morning got thither, where at the first he was admitted to Maximus presence, to whom he declared how that Angelica was at Saint Austins Chappel, where Iabin was Priest, relating the whole truth of all that he had seen and heard. Maximus by his speeches perceiued that it was the vnknowne Knight that was with her, which very thought, kindled new sparkes of Ire in his brest, which before he had calmed: that in a monstrous rage, he vowed if euer he caught that vnknowne Knight to be reuenged on him with seueritie. Then presently he assembled all his Nobles and Knights togither again, commaunding them with all speed to be readie to go with him, not making the cause knowne to any: who with all speed buckled on their Armor, and at his comming downe departed with him: who hasted with all speed towards S. Austins , Chappell, where he arriued with more then ordinary speed. Angelica at the very instant of their arriuall, was fallen into a slumber, and dreampt that her father Maximus had compassed the Chappell with armed men, wherewith her sences were so affrighted, that she sodenly started vp from the place where she laie, and with a sodaine shake leapt to Parismenos, and caught him in her armes. Parismenos maruelling, and being amazed at her suddaine crie, demaunded what she ayled: which for feare she could not vtter: that he halfe astonisht, ranne to his Armour and armed himselfe therewith, clasping his bright sword in his hand, which he had no sooner done, but he heard one knocke at the Chappel doore, which made him know that it was not Iabin , and looking out at the window, he sawe thousands of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulians in Armour, which so appalled his sences, that he was readie to fall downe dead. Angelica seeing his suddain sadnesse, likewise stepping vp to the window, beheld the souldiers without, that she fel downe for griefe: which Dulcia seeing, she with Anna tooke her vp, and conueyed her into the Cell. Then Parismenos opened the doore, and the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian knights offered to enter, but Parismenos setting himselfe in the doore with his sword point bent against them, told them, that whosoeuer entred first should die. With that Maximus asked him what he was? I am (quoth he) inferior to none, and therefore as good as any. Art thou Marcellus (quoth he?) I am not Marcellus but his friend. Tell me what thou art quoth Maximus , or I vow thou shalt die? Maximus (quoth he) I am sonne to Parismus of Bohemia , my name Parismenos , sometimes called the vnknowne knight. Maximus hearing his speeches, wondred at them, and said: Is not Angelica with you? Yes (quoth he) both Angelica and Marcellus are within. Deliuer them (quoth Maximus to me.

Maximus was so enraged with his speeches, that hee answered, what madnesse doth possesse thy mind, that standeth vpon such termes of resistance, when thou seest thousands of armed souldiers incompasse thy life? thinkest thou with boasting speeches to auoide my displeasure, and disappoint my reuenge: no, wert thou the greatest potentate in the world, thou couldest not escape my hands: with that he commanded his knights to apprehend him by force: with that they began to enter vpon him, but hee (by reason of the narrownesse of the way) stoode in his owne defence, and slew the first that came: and after him an other, and behaued himselfe so couragiously, that which of them first entred, first died: and had they all assaied to enter that way, hee would haue slaine them all. Marcellus seeing what a mischiefe this slaughter might breede, and withall, knowing that it was impossible for them any way to escape, but rather to incense Maximus to more desire of reuenge, stept betweene Parismenos and the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulans, who knowing him, would not offer a blowe at him, whilest hee spake to Porismenos , desiring him to bee ruled by him, who likewise considered that in this extremitie it was best to yeelde, for there was no hope of escape, therefore hee agreed to do according to his direction. Marcellus then vpon his knee submitted himselfe to his father. By this time the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulians had beate downe a great part of the chappell, and rushed in violentlie vpon Parismenos , who disdaining to be forced to yeelde, before they could ouercome him, sent many of their ghosts to hell, but in the end by their multitude he was so thronged, that he could not lift his armes to strike another blowe, and so was constrained to yeeld, whom Maximus commaunded to bee first bound. Angelica seeing this, with weeping eyes humbled her selfe vppon her knee to her father, and said. I beseech your Maiestie vse that knight honourably, on whose safetie my life dependeth: more she would haue said, but Maximus cut her off with these speeches. Poore, shamelesse, and disobedient creature, pleadest thou for him, and not rather for pardon to thy owne shamelesse deeds? hold thy tongue, for I will not heare thee speake a word more. With that hee commaunded them all to bee apprehended, and so he departed with them to the Court, first imprisoning Parismenos , and giuing him with bolts and fetters of Iron, casting him into a most loathsome, stinking, and darke dungeon. Angelica hee caused likewise to be desrobed of her ornaments, and cast into a prison with Anna and Dulcia , vntill they had more leisure to determine of them. Marcellus at the instant intreaties of the Queene and Nobles, hee did not imprison, but with many rebukes and reproaches banisht him his presence, vowing that if euer he came in his sight, hee should loose his head. To rehearse the seuerall complaints Angelica and Dulcia made, would be tedious to rehearse, and greeuous to recite, for they were such as would force salt teares from Tyrants eyes, pearce the stonie rockes, and mollifie the hardened hearts of the most rude, cruell, barbarous, and inhumane monsters in the whole world, being hardly vsed, scantly dieted, and badly lodged, that Maximus often hearing their plaints, pittied their laments, yet therewith was rather drawne to more seueritie, then any way mollified. Parismenos miserie likewise was nothing inferiour to theirs, but rather tenne times woorse, being alone (they hauing the benefit of each others companie, which is a great comfort in miserie) without light, for the vaut or dungeon whereinto he was thrust, had not so much as a creuice, where through any light appeared, being large and wide, far from any company, that he could not heare any creatures voyce, hauing but once a day foode, which was bread and water, and of that so little, that it would scarce preserue life, clogd and ouerladen with the burdenous wayt of chaines and boltes: in which sort he continued many daies, without hope euer to escape from that place, where you may suppose his cares were great, and his comfort small. Many daies being past, Maximus assembled all his Nobles and Estates of the countrie togither, to determine what to do with Parismenos , against whom many accusations were laide, which tended to the breach of their lawes, especially that of Angelicas rape, which was amongst them punished with death, and that so seuerely, as that none escaped: whom the king in open audience condemned to die the same death that the lawes yeelded, which was to bee burnt. Dulcia likewise they condemned to perpetual imprisonment: but for the kings children, by the lawe they were to stand at their Parents disposition. This newes was soone conueyed to Marcellus knowledge, which strooke an exceeding torment to his heart, which rather then he would indure to see, hee would execute his owne death desperately to saue his friend, that he seemed like a madde man, and wheresoeuer he became, he made those that beheld him wonder to see him so altered in gesture, and so suddainly, that hee quite forsooke the Court, and continually remained at Panoras house, so secretly, that none knewe what was become of him. Parismenos hauing continued many daies in the loathsome dungeon, maruelling that he could heare no newes from Angelica , and also that Marcellus had forgotten to yeeld him comfort in his greatest extremitie, thought that either they were imprisoned, or else that the K. in his furie had executed some cruell reuenge vpon the. These cares on the one side were sufficient torments, and his hard imprisonment and cruel vsage on the other side, ynough to kill the stoutest heart, that had he not beene preserued by admirable and straunge operation, he could neuer haue indured those calamities. At last hee beganne to dispaire of all hope, and suddainly to recall his sences, and with more comfort to studie how to release him, and amongst many thousand of deuises which came into his fancie, hee deuised how to intice the Keeper to come into the dungeon, which hee thus contriued. The next time the Iaylor came to bring him his vsuall diet, hee fained himselfe exceedingly sicke, and groned as though hee had gasped for his latest breath. The Iaylor hearing him make such mone, asked him what he ayled. To whome Parismenos said: Good Iaylor, the date of my life is now at an ende, that I neuer looke to see the day light againe, being most vnfortunate to ende my wretched life in this place, that might haue liued in great dingnitie in my owne countrie: but now past hope of all comfort: onely to thee am I able to do good before I die, I haue good store of golde and Iewels about mee, which I will giue vnto thee, if thou wilt but do thy indeuour to saue my life, for that I am yet in hope of his mercie: and withall, I will declare vnto thee where thou shalt haue more riches then thou wilt euer bee able to spend. All this will I do for thee, if thou wilt helpe me out of this miserable life, or yeelde mee some of thy helpe, for that I am fallen and am not able to rise. Many other perswasions Parismenos vsed, which wrought so effectually with the Iaylor, that intised with hope of finding wealth, and past fear of him that was so weake, he opened the dungeon without any feare or doubt, (being thereto guided by the diuine prouidence) and came to Parismenos , who no sooner sawe him within reach of his armes, (retaining a most manly courage notwithstanding his weakenesse) gathering all his strength togither, caught holde on him and ouerthrew him, and getting vppon him with swift crawling, for that he was not able to stand by reason of his bolltes, and hauing him vnder him, neuer left strugling and striuing with him, vntill he had strangled him. Then taking the bunch of keyes vppe, hee loosened and vnlockt all the boltes that were fastned to his legs, necke, and other parts of his bodie, which when hee had done prostrating himselfe vpon his knees, hee praised God for that happie successe: then presently without delay, he stript off all the Iaylors apparell, and apparrelled himselfe therewith, casting his bodie into the farther ende of the dungeon, and so went out and locked the dungeon doore after him. By this time it beganne to be darke, which was a meanes to further him to escape, that in the Iaylors apparrell hee went into the Court with the keyes at his girdle, and the Iaylors fawchion which hee continually ware about him, and met with diuers, passing by them without suspition, and from thence he gate out of the Court gates, beeing of euerie one taken for the Iaylor. And being without the Court, he neuer stayed vntill he was out of the Cittie, flinging the keyes into a poole of water hard without the Cittie gates, tooke his iourney directly to Saint Austines Chappell, thinking there to finde Iabine , whom the king had mist, for that hee was not in the Cell when Maximus apprehended Parismenos . Earely the next morning he arriued there, where at his comming he found an armie of horsemen, that spred all the fields with their troupes, and presently knewe them to bee Bohemians, some of them espying him, taking him to bee a spie, carried him before Pollipus , who was their Generall. Parismenos being come before Pollipus , was by him strictly examined, to whom he said. Wherefore haue you brought this armie into [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulia ? Why (quoth Pollipus ) haste thou not heard how Parismenos is imprisoned by Maximus wrongfully? and moreouer, hath iudged him to a vile and shamefull death, which hee is to suffer sixe daies hence? Parismenos hearing his speeches, maruelled how hee should come to the knowledge of that news, which olde Iabine had told them. With that he said: Parismenos is not in prison, but now is at libertie, which I came to giue you knowledge of, for whom you neede not take more care. Villaine (quoth Pollipus ) what sayest thou, is Parismenos dead? With that his colour beganne to go and come, and his heart was exceedingly tormented. Parismenos then discouered himselfe, whom Pollipus espying, caught him in his armes with a feruent embrace, the rest of the knights thronging about him with exceeding ioy. This newes was soone spredde through the whole campe, who flung vp, some their staues, some their helmets, and euerie one something, yeelding foorth many a shout for ioy, then presently commaundement (entermingled with kinde intreatie) was giuen, that none should vpon no occasion whatsoeuer, discouer Parismenos beeing amongst theme being assured of the trueth of his escape by his owne report. How Pollipus besieged the Cittie of Ephesus , and of the battell fought with the Natolians. How Maximus recalled Marcellus from banishment, banisht Dulcia , released Angelica out of prison, sent for aide into Barbarie and Libia . with Pollipus , gate him Armour whereby he might easily bee knowne from the rest of ye Bohemians, and yet not knowne whom he was, and presently without any delaie, he and Pollipus marched with their troupes to the Citie of Ephesus , and begirt the same round, Maximus seeing his Citie begirt with souldiers, sent out a Herald to know what they were, who brought him word they were Bohemians, that were come to redeem Parismenos , and to reuenge the iniuries he had don him, vpon false reports of the King of Libia. Maximus hearing that, presently commaunded an Armie of twise as many Natolians , as there were Bohemians, to be gathered togither, vnder the conduct of Duke Pridamor , a valiant and resolute Noble man, who according to his valour at his first approach, entred battell with the Bohemians, and by great oddes, thought soone to discomfort them: but the Bohemians being men of good experience, and expert souldiers, as little esteemed the Natolians, as if they themselues had had the oddes. Parismenos now thought it time to bestirre himselfe, to worke reuenge, and to make proofe of his valour, that being gallantly mouted, he couched his speare, and ran at a Natolian knight and pearcrd the same quite through his body: which done, he drew his sword, and met an other with so full a blowe, that he tumbled from his horse, and was troden to death: an other with violence he rusht quite through the guts: the fourth, lost his arme. And in this sort he entred into the thickest of them, spending neuer a blow in waste: but eyther a Natolian lost his life, or some part of his body thireby: that on a suddaine, by his valour, the Bohemians had disranckt the Natolians, and the horsemen made an exceeding slaughter amongst them. By this time Parismenos was come to the maine battell, where he met with Pridamor , mounted vpon a white steed, his caparisons of beaten gold, beset with pearle and precious stone: his Armor of the richest workmanship with a plume of spangled feathers in his crest, who had vowed to satisfie his proud mind with Bohemians blood: at whom Parismenos ran hauing gotten a speare, and contrary to his proud expectation, Parismenos forceable encounter, turned his heeles vpward, and fell backwards ouer his horse rump, almost stifeled with his furniture: at which the Bohemians gaue an exceeding shoute to see Parismenos valor. All this time Pollipus was not idle, but shewed such exceeding tokens of his valor, that all that beheld him and Parismenos , thought there could not be two more valiant knights in the world. After Pridamor had recouered his horse, he kept his band of souldiers togither more warily,  & seeing what slaughter the Bohemias had made sounded retrait, whilest the Bohemians pursued them euen vnto their Campe, and slew a great number of them, that all the earth was strewed with their dead bodies. The Bohemians likewise with ioyfull harts returned to their tents, growing into such admired estimation of Parismenos , that they determined not to leaue the least part of his desire vnperformed, though they atchieued the same with extreame peril and hazard of their liues. Maximus and the Queene all this while stood and beheld the battell, maruelling what two Knights they were that made such hauocke amongst his Subiects, that he was exceedingly enraged to see so much of his countrie bloud shed: that departing downe, he assembled all his councell togither, asking their aduice and aide in this extremitie. Who at the last, woon him to condiscend to these conditions, that Marcellus banishment should be repealed, whose absence appalled the Natolians hearts, that they were rather like men confounded then otherwise therby. And that Dulcia should be bannished, and sent forth of the Citie in base attire, with commandement, that vpon paine of death none shuld succor her. That Angelica should be released from prison, and restored to his fauor. That he should send into Libia , for the kings ayde against the Bohemians, the quarell being partly his. That he shuld send his Embassadors to the K. of Barbarie , to craue his assistance against the Bohemians. Which Articles Maximus agreed vnto, rather then hee wold mittigate his ire, and send backe Parismenos in safetie, which his Nobles earnestly required. Then was Marc . bannishment repealed, Ange . was taken out of prison: messengers sent into Libia : Embassad. into Barbarie . And Dulcia was presently take out of prison, disrobed of her attires, and clad in base and vnseemely weeds, and so in an euening cast out of the citie gates, in most poore and miserable estate. When she saw her selfe thus vsed, and knew the commandement was giuen, that none vpon paine of death should succor her, she then thought her estate most miserable, and more wretched then when shee was in prison, where yet Marcellus knew of her being. But now in this poore estate she shuld be hated of all, despised, reiected, and for want of foode famished: yea and forsaken of Marcellus . Then she began to studie which way to remedy these euils, wherein she sawe nothing but impossibilities: for she thoght if she should be taken by the Natolia souldiers, they wold vse her as a castaway, and not pitie her: but rather seeke her dishonor, when she was without meanes of reuenge: yt to seek cofort there, she thoght it in vaine, & dangerous: and so many cares opprest her hart, yt she was almost ouercome with griefe. At last determined to go to the Generall of the Bohemian Armie, whom she thought wold for Pa . sake shew her some pitty, which she did the next morning: And being brought before the Generall, she kneeled downe and said: Most noble Generall, shewe pittie to a poore and forsaken woman, that by Fortunes mutabilitie, and Maximus crueltie, am driuen to this poore estate without any desert. My name is Dulcia , sometimes of good reputation in the Natolian Court, till Marcellus the Kings sonne attained my consent to loue him, and withall to auoyd his fathers crueltie, at such time as Parismenos had carried Angelica from the Golden Tower to S. Austins Chappell: My deare Lord Marcellus likewise conueyed me into Angelicas company, where I was taken with her, and so carried to prison. And now Maximus I knew not vpon what occasion, hath banished me the Citie, and giuen commaundement, that none vpon paine of death should succor me: that in this distressed estate I dare not be found of any of the Natolians, lest they should (although not of their owne wil, yet by the Kings commaund) worke my shame, that Marcellus might forsake me: but am come to you for mercy, beseeching you of pittie to shelter me with your fauor from these wrongs. Parismenos knowing her, came vnto her and tooke her by the hand, saying that the King of Natolia should not wrong her in that place. Dulcia beholding his countenance, presently knew him, and with reuerence fell at his feete with exceeding ioy. But he taking her vp again, led her with Pollipus to his Tent, demaunding how Angelica did, whom she acquainted with the sorrow she daily made for his imprisonment and feare of his death, and how that when she was banished, Angelica was taken into fauour againe: and how that none knewe what was become of Marcellus , wherewith she wept exceedingly: whom Parismenos comforted by all meanes hee could, himselfe gathering much comfort from her speeches, of assurance of Angelicas loue. The messenger that went into Libia , made great haste til he had deliuered his message, which when the king of Libia heard, wishing for reuenge of the Knight of Fame, as he supposed he had doue for him, and also to reuenge some part of ye grudge he bare Parismus , euer since his being in Thessaly , and the ouerthrow he had receiued at his hands: which he was in minde to haue done, when he had him in his Court, but that it would haue bene too great a blemish to his honour: therefore he now mustred all his forces togither, and by sea conueyed them into Natolia . Likewise the Embassadours that went into Barbary , executed their Embassage with such eloquence, that Moroco the King, collected an Armie of a hundreth thousand Moores, and sent them by shipping into Natolia , vnder the conduct of his eldest sonne Sancodelordoro , a most valiant, stout and couragious Prince: which forces soone landed in Natolia , and pitched their Tents before the Citie of Ephesus. Parismenos seeing these new come forces, marueiled of whence they should be, but soone learned the truth thereof. Maximus likewise had knowledge brought him of the king of Libias approach, and of Sancodelordoro his landing, whom he welcommed with exceeding reioycings, and entertained with great curtesies, feastings and banquettings. How Parismus arriued in Natolia with a band of souldiers, and of his ioy for Parismenos safetie. How Maximus appointed Parismenos to be burnt. And the lamentation Angelica made with Marcellus . The King of Libia thirsting after the Knight of Fames life, (whom he now knewe to be sonne to Parismus ) vsed all the perswasions he could, to instigate Maximus to reuenge: who of his owne disposition was readie inogh to such tyrannie: concluding within three dayes after, to put the same in execution without remorse. And all the Natolians remained in great tranquilitie, by reason of the aide was brought them; and the multitude of their Armie which was like the sands in number. Parismus was now come into Natolia with his Armie, which was threescore thousand Bohemians,  & Thessalians, whose approach exceedingly reioyced Parismenos & Pollipus . And hauing pitcht his Tents neare vnto the rest of his horsemen, he was met and welcommed by Pollipus , to whom he said with a heauie countenance: O Pollipus , all the labour we haue taken is in vaine to saue Parismenos , onely we may reuenge his death. What iniustice and crueltie is this ye heauens impose vpon his head, that euer since his birth hath bene euerlastingly miserable? Would God he had remaimained stil in Bohemia , and neuer haue sought Angelicas loue, and that my selfe with these souldiers had guarded him, that we might either haue died with him, or els haue preserued him from that infamous death he is like to suffer. My Lord (quoth Pollipus) Parismenos is in safetie. How can that be (quoth he) when the report is in euerie mans mouth, that he must die a most shamefull death, and they haue him in prison. Parismenos then humbled himselfe vpon his knee, whom Parismus soone knew, & most louingly embraced him, who certified him of all that had happened, and that the king of Natolia did thinke hee was still in prison. This newes exceedingly reioyced Parismus heart, and that whereas before by reason of his sadnesse, the whole campe had laide aside mirth, now hearing of his safetie, they reassumed new comfort. Now the day was come nigh which Parismenos should be burnt, to which intent Maximus caused a stake to bee pitched in the chiefest place of the Cittie, and that the whole multitude of the Cittizens were before the time of execution, gathered togither to see the same, that the house toppes, windowes, streetes, turrets, and euerie place were pestred with their abundance. Angelica hearing thereof, beganne to exclaime and crie out most bitterly, making such lamentations, that the heauens and euery deitie seemed to pittie her. When the time of execution was come, Maximus , the king of Libia, Santodelodoro , the Queene, and many thousand knights of Natolia, Libia , and Barbaria , were assembled, and seated to see the same. And the Judges gone to the dungeon to bring foorth the prisoner. The Iaylors wife before missing her husband, had broken vp the Dungeon doore, where she found him dead, and Parismenos fledde, but fearing the kings furie, durst not bewray the same: but apparrelled her husband in Parismenos garments, and told the Iudges that he was dead, who taking it to be the right bodie, caused certaine slaues to take the same vp, and in mourning wise brought it to the place of execution. Angelica now seeing the time was come, and hauing word brought her that Parismenos was alreadie gone with the iudges, tare her golden haire, cast off all her ornaments from her head, and raged so extreamely, that her damzels could not hold her, but getting a knife in her hand, she desperately vowed, that whosoeuer offered but to touch her, she would with the same end her life. With that she ranne downe her chamber into the Court, from thence into the Cittie, and so to the place of execution, when the king was giuing his iudgement according to the lawes. Her Ladies seeing her desperatenesse, durst not stay her, but ran after her, & whe she came to the place, she first ran to the fire, intending that if she founde him there, she would die with him: but suddeinly espying the hearse, and the Iudges standing by the same, she ranne thereto, with her golden haire hanging downe her shoulders, her eyes swolne with griefe, her Ornaments all betorne and tortured, her hands all besmeared with blood, which she had cut with holding fast the knife, and her face with the same blood al besmeared, when with her bloody hands she wiped away the teares that hindred her sight by their aboundant passage. Maximus and the Queene knowing her, ranne to her with exceeding haste, the King of Libia and Santodelodoro were amazed hereat, and the Citizens in an vproare, the Iudges offering to laie hands on her, but she starting backe, bent her kniues poynt to her brest, protesting to gore it in her heart blood, if they offred to touch her. Maximus likewise and the Queene, by this time were come to her, whom she would not suffer to come neare her, but vowed to be her owne death: with which they were all amazed, the Ladies they stood weeping and wringing their handes. At last one of the Iudges thus spake: Good Angelica be quiet, this knight is alreadie dead in prison. With that Angelica with her hand casting aside the haire which couered some part of her face, holding the fatall knife desperately, and with an amazed countenance, fixing her eyes vpon her father, said. Mercilesse and most cruell King, what tyrannie is this you haue showen, to be the vniust executioner of that most vertuous knight, who neuer deserued such rygor, but onely came into this Countrey for my sake, whose death shalbe the vttermost date of my wretched life? Heauens graunt this wrongfull sheading of innocent blood, may not goe vnreuenged. All plagues of heauen and earth light vppon their cursed heads, that did this cruell deede. Heere lyes true loyaltie and constant vertue slaine. Heere lyes valour and knightly honour massacred. Heere lyes the knight whose splendor did beautifie the glories of all the knights in the world. Heere lyes innocent pietie falsly accused, by the disloyall King of Libia , whom were he liuing, would with his countenance abate thy courage. In him shinde all prowesse, and by his death what haue you gainde, but ignominious infamie, perpetuall shame and dishonour. As she was continuing the length of her speech, the peoples voyces sounded foorth the eccho of another dismall crie, for Maximus hauing knowledge of the execution, being in Panoras house, being halfe apparrelled, caught vp his sword, and came running towards the place, murthering such as hindred his speed: and with his sword made way for his hastie steppes, and lept to Angelica , folding her in his one arme, and holding his sword luke warme with bloode in the other, saying. Oh sister, what ioy do I conceiue at your loyaltie? now do I see you loue Parismenos : be constant deare sister, and let vs both die with him, for he would not haue refused a thousand deaths for our sakes. Then beganne the people to crie out: Saue the kings children: and such an vprore & tumult arose, that heauen and earth seemed to shake with the noyse. The Iaylors wife standing by, and seeing the two young Princes readie to sacrifice themselues, beeing assured that none but her selfe knewe the trueth, and that it rested onely in her to saue their liues, especially being touched with remorse, shee suddainly stept to the two young Princes and said. Stay, stay, gentle young Princes, and heare the trueth of all. This dead bodie whom you suppose to be Parismenos , is the Iaylor, though cladde in his apparrell, for that woorthie Knight escaped out of the dungeon: if you behold the corpes, you shall perceiue it to be the bodie of my husband. With that Marcellus started to the hearse, and casting off the cloth that couered the same, knew that it was not Parismenos , then casting away his sword, hee embraced Angelica in his armes, who seeing the trueth of all, and that Parismenos was escaped, (with whom shee came of purpose to haue died) let fall the knife from foorth her hand, and casting downe her eyes to the earth, was clothed by the Ladies that attended her. The king was so amazed with this news, that he stood like one sencelesse: the King of Libia for shame of Angelicas speeches, bent his eyes vpon the earth with a sadde countenance, and all the whole assembly of the beholders were confounded in their sences, and stoode as men transformed into admiration. Presently in the middest of this amazement, came a knight posting with speede, his countenance bewraying some tragicall report, who vttered these speeches. Most noble Kings, whilest you stand here debating matters of small importance, the Bohemians haue destroyed thousands of your souldiers, who now runne vp and downe like men agast, for want of their Captaines, that all the fields are strewed with their dead bodies, the valleyes staind with blood, and the drie ground is drunke therewith, our enemies armes are fired with slaughter, and we compelled to flie for feare, with speede recure this euill, or else the pace of Natolia is lost. Then beganne a new terror, Maximus , the King of Libia, Santodelodoro, Pridamor , and all the Nobles of Natolia hasted to the campe, Marcellus ranne to get him armour: the Queene, Angelica , and all the Ladies, went to a Tower to behold this battell, most to see the Bohemians death, but Angelica to behold the valour of Parismus , whom she heard was come to redeem his son Parismenos , and in some hope to see him amongst them, her heart inwardly vttering many deuoted inuocations for the Bohemians victorie. Maximus and the rest by this time were come to the gates, where they met with thousandes of souldiers flying to saue their liues, whom they caused to turne back, & being without the gates, they could hardly passe for the slaughtered carkasses of Moores, Natolians, and Libians, that lay dead, and in the campe they sawe such confused slaughters, and heard such greeuous cries, that it amazed their sences to see the same: heere lay thousandes slaine, there lay multitudes gasping for life, and bathing in their lukewarme blood, heere others lay mangled with wide gaping woundes, there horse and man lay both dead togither, the Natolians flying, the Bohemians pursuing and glutting their swords in blood. Then Maximus cheered vp his subiects to new courage, then the King of Libia beganne to gather togither his scattered forces, and Santodelodoro amongst his Moores, and those that were before almost vanquished gathering a new head. Parismenos hauing knowledge of Maximus approach, neuer left vntill he had met him, which when he had obtained, he seemed to stretch his armes, purposing reuenge, & brandishing his sword, smote at him with forcible blowes, till hee beate him from his horse, and being fallen to the ground, hee would haue troden him to death with his horse hooues, but that Pridamor seeing the king in that distresse, with thousands of Natolian Knights rescued him, which before they could attaine, they lost many of their liues by Parismenos valiant chiualrie. Parismus in the meane time, met the King of Libia and vnhorsed him, and after him many hundred knights, that none came within the compasse of his sword but died. Pollipus likewise maintained cruell fight against Santodelodoro , that thousands of the vanquished Moores lost their liues by his valor. And such slaughters were performed by Parismenos , beeing the first battell that euer hee fought, that both Parismus and all that sawe him, admired to see the same, who had taken Pridamor prisoner and sent him to his Tent. The Queene and Angelica all this while beheld the battell, the one with feare, the other with ioy, the Queene fearing Maximus death, and Angelica in hope that the valiant knight in Azurd armour beset with Eagles of gold, that made such slaughter, was Parismenos , which hope was bredde in her by remembring his comely proportion which this did not much differ. By this time the night beganne to approach, that the Bohemians wearie of shedding their enemies blood, withdrew them to their tents, appoynting most diligent watch to bee kept throughout the whole campe. The Natolians and the rest of that partie glad of some respite, retired to their tents, and numbring their souldiers, found the one halfe of them slaine, and many greeuously wounded, that they could scarce burie their dead. Maximus was gone into the Cittie greeuously wounded. The king of Libia and Santodelodoro staied in their tents in the field. Angelica was returned to her chamber very sickly, by reason of the ouermuch desperature, vexation and greefe she had indured that day, being yet more comforted in her heart with hope of Parismenos safetie, then she had bene many daies before. Marcellus was returned to Panoras house, tormenting himselfe with exceeding greefe for Dulcias absence, fearing that she was perished, that he entred into that kinde of lamentation, that Panora was oftentimes in feare he would destroy himselfe. Dulcia was likewise all this while in the campe with Parismenos , in very sorrowfull estate for Marcellus want. Thus each of these friends were in safetie, yet none of them in hope to see the other againe. Of two battelles fought with the Natolian forces: the manner of Maximus cruell death: and of the friendly league betwixt Parismus and Marcellus . The next morning Maximus , the king of Libia , and Santodelodoro , with the States of Natolia , assembled togither to determine the doubtfull issue of this war, and at last by a generall consent, concluded to parley with their enemies, and to that intent sent out a Herald to Parismus , who presently returned answere, that if the king of Natolia would parley with him in the fielde betwixt both the campes, hee would there meete him, and conclude a peace for one day, which the king of Natolia accepted. When they were met, Maximus began as followeth. Prince of Bohemia , what is it thou crauest at my hands? or wherefore haste thou brought, contrarie to the lawes of kings, a band of souldiers into this countrie, where thou art not to set foote without my licence. Natolian Tyrant (quoth hee) I come to redeeme my sonne, whom thou haste murthered contrarie to lawe, iustice, and equitie, whose blood I require at thy vniust and cruell hands, also to reuenge the manifold wrongs thou haste done him, by the disloyall and false accusation of the king of Libia here present. Parismus (quoth he) I haue done nothing to thy son but according to the lawes of this land, which punisheth rape especially of a kings daughter, with death. My sonne (quoth he) neuer committed such act, but carried away Angelica with her willing consent, whereby hee is vniustly iudged: withall, I demaunde her of thee, as by right belonging vnto him, for that shee is his betrothed wife, whom I will haue before I leaue Natolia , or see the ruine of thee and of thy kingdome: therefore yeelde her into my custodie. With that Santodelodoro stept foorth and saide: Thinkest thou Bohemian to commaund vs in this place, thou art too weake, therfore be gone quickly, or thou shalt soone see so many Moores here, as shall confound thy sences with amazement. Knowe (quoth Parismus ) that what I haue said I will performe, and so little doo I esteeme your forces, that I will yeelde those prisoners I haue without ransome: then he gaue them Pridamor againe. Many other speeches past betwixt them, wherewith in the ende Maximus was so inraged, that he sware by heauen and earth, that he would rather see his owne death, his countries wracke, and Angelicas destruction, before shee should be giuen to his custodie, and so departed. Parismenos was exceedingly troubled when hee heard Maximus speeches, who he knew to be of so cruel a disposition, that he would rather indeede see her death, then be crost of his will, that he continued in great care and continuall torment of minde. Assoone as they were parted, Parismus, Pollipus , and Parismenos , beganne to consult what to do, euerie one being desirous of victorie, at last Parismenos said. Most noble father, if I may presume to giue counsell to you that are of farre greater wisedom, and better experienced in these martiall affairs the I am, this is my opinion: Maximus is of ye cruell disposition, that rather then hee will bee contradicted, hee wil see the destruction of himselfe and his posteritie, that it is not valor, but wilfulnesse, that maketh him resolute: their foes likewise are so much weakened by the last slaughter we made amongst them, that if we can giue them an other sodaine onset, they will be vtterly dismaied: besides, the Kings eldest son Marc . is my deare friend, on whose faith and fidelitie I durst repose my life: who if he could attaine the Cittie, would be ready to aide vs: therfore so pleaseth you, let vs giue the onset when they are in their dead sleepe, which will bring such terror and amazement to their hearts, that they will bee like men amazed. Parismus hearing his words, liked his counsell very well: and thus he contriued this businesse, the band shuld be deuided into three parts: the one to be vnder the conduct of himselfe, the other, vnder Parismenos , and the third vnder Pollipus : which was so secretly done, that the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulians had not the least knowledge thereof.

The [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulians being then in theyr dead sleepe, and without the least thought of any such inuasion, were so amazed with this assault, that they ran vp and downe, some weaponlesse, and some halfe armed, and some with their swords onelie: and the Bohemians in the middest of them, making an exceeding slaughter. The King of Libia and Santodelodoro were so eager, that they ran vp and downe calling for their Armour, and crying out, courage, courage. And being armed, they began to courage their amazed souldiers, with many comfortable speeches, but the Bohemians were so thicke amongst them, and had so much disordered them, that some of them lost their liues as they were putting on their armor: others were slaughtered, euen whilest the sleepe was in their eyes: others strooken dead, as they were lifting their armes to strike the first blowe: and some slaine before they could recall their sences from amazement: there might one heare the dismall grones of murdred soules: there might one perceiue slaughter in her royaltie, and reuenge filling his thirstie heart with blood: feare stood trembling in his right hue, terror appeared in the Moores gastlie lookes, & victorie on the Bohemians swords. The Prince behinde them, slaughtering some before they could looke backe. Pollipus before them with his furie parting the soules from the bodies. And Parismenos with his bloudie sword cutting off their passage to the Cittie. The prince met with Santodelodoro , and made him flee to saue himselfe from death. Pollipus met with Pridamor , and gaue him so many wounds, that he durst no longer abide his sight: and Parismenos turned backe the King of Libias steps, hasting to the citie, and pursued him with such eagar chase, and gaue him so many greeuous wounds, that had hee not withdrewe and held himselfe amongst a throng of Libians , he had dyed by his hands. All the Natolians wer amazed, terrified, discouraged and confounded in their thoughts, being so cruelly and valiantly assaulted by the Bohemians, that they began to flie and forsake the Campe, euery one shifting to saue his life: there was such a crie, that the noyse thereof was heard into the cittie. The cittizens, supposing there had bene some mutinie in the Campe amongst the souldiers, ran out at the gates, which aduantage Parismenos soone espied, and got their possession. Then began the cittizens to cry out, and run with amazed terror: the beacons were set on fire, the belles roong out with a confused noyse, and euery signe of amazement was made. This noyse soone came to Maximus hearing, who vexed with a chaos of confused thoughts, caught vp a sword, and in a desperate furie ran into the citie, the Knights betooke them to their Armour: the Ladies forsooke their beds, wringing their hands, and making great lamentation. Angelica affrighted with their cries, apparelled her selfe, not knowing what this tumult should portend. Marcellus likewise was with the noyse awakened from his sleepe, and leauing Panoras house, with his sword in the one hand, and his doublet in the other, ran out into the open streetes, to see the cause of this vprore. By this time, the streetes were filled with souldiers, and Parismenos was gotten to the court gates. Where he met with Maximus the King, but would not offer to touch him: who like a furious, mad, and desperate man, ran amongst the Bohemian souldiers, brandishing his sword, and slaughtering such as stood next him, where he met with Marcellus raging about, starke mad with griefe, who desired him to withdraw himselfe, least he were destroyed by the common souldiers: but he refusing his counsell, and ouercome with mad frenzie, rushed amongst the thickest of them, without cosideration, wounding some, and slaughtering those that offered not to touch him (beeing before commanded by Parismenos not to laie violent hands on him) but his carelesse furie wrought his owne downfall: and his owne folly confirmed the prophesie that he had long time feared: for most lamentably in a throng of Bohemian horsmen, he was troden to death. By this time Marcellus was come to the Court, fearing least the souldiers should enter and affright the Queene and Angelica , where he found Parismenos , though vnknowne, keeping the entrance, running at him most furiously, to whom Parismenos said: Marcellus hold thy hands, here is none but friends. With that word he said, who art thou that knowest me? I am (quoth he) a friend to Marcellus , and wish you withdrawe your selfe into the Court, least you be hurt amongst my souldiers. Marcellus hearing his speeches, stept within the Court gates. By this time the Prince of Bohemia and Pollipu , had put the Natolian forces to flight, and taken Santodelodoro and Pridamor prisoners, the King of Libia was fled, the common souldiers had ransackt the Campe, and began to sacke the Citie, vntil the day began to appeare and the Prince of Bohemia and Pollipus hauing attained victorie, gaue commaundement that none vpon paine of death should offer to enter any of the Citizens houses. The Nobles seeing what slaughter the Bohemians had made, how the Moores and Libians were fledde, and the Cittie readie to be sackt, came to the Queene & certified her the truth of all. Who missing Maximus , carelesly ranne into the Citie to seeke him, renting her garments, and making exceeding mone: and at last found him troden to death, and not slaughtered with mans force, but by the brute beasts: casting her selfe carelesly and desperately vpon his dead corpes, vttering many lamentable speeches, vntil the Nobles withheld her from doing her selfe violence, which she often intended, and taking vp their dead Kings corpes, carried him to the Court with great lamentation. Marcellus comming to Parismus , with a kinde behauiour said: Most Noble Prince of Bohemia , I beseech you staie your incensed wrath, and seeke not the ruine and destruction of this Citie and vs, for Maximus being dead, there is none that will make resistance, but rather entertaine you with willing hearts, being alwaies vnwilling to haue moued you to seeke this reuenge: but that it was not in vs to contradict Maximus will: who was rather ledde and ouerruled by rage then aduise: therefore we yeeld our selues to your mercy. Parismus being certified that it was Marcellus whome loued Parismenos , and was alwaies his deare friend, said. Noble Prince, thinke that I sought no way to iniury you, but to redeeme my sonne and reuenge his wrong: which now the iust heauens haue executed in my behalfe: but what restitution can bee made me for his losse, whose vntimely death was acted by Maximus cruelty? I seeke not your harme but his recouery: therefore be you assured of peace, and that I will at your request cease all further strife, vpon your princely promise of securitie. Marcellus then said. I haue alwaies honoured your name: much more doo I affect your presence, desiring nothing more, then to be well esteemed of you: that now Maximus is dead, and my selfe next to succeed in the Kingdome, whosoeuer shall offer to iniurie the worst Bohemian souldier, I will hate him whilest I liue: therefore, I beseech you rest in assurance, vpon my promise, and vouchsafe such entertainment as this court can yeeld, too vnworthy to giue you welcome. Which words Marcellus spake in the hearing and presence of all the Nobles and Peares of his Land: who likewise (notwithstanding the slaughter the Bohemians had made) willingly ratified his speeches, with their vnconstrained conent. Parismus then alighted and embraced Marcellus , and Pollipus did the like: first appointed what the souldiers should doo; and then went into the court with Marcellus . The souldiers that were dispearced into euery corner of the Citie, returned to the Camp, sauing a sufficient guard of Bohemian knights that stayed to guarde the Prince. Marcellus sent out messengers to gather togither the scattered troupes of the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian Campe, and gaue them great rewards: those that were maimed and wounded, hee caused to bee brought to a place, where they were very dilligently looked vnto by skilfull Phisitians. And euery one notwithstanding their former discontent, were by Marcellus highly satisfied. How Sicheus sonne to the Emperor of Constantinople, Remulus king of Thrace and others, landed in Natolia . Of Parismenos discouery: how hee was elected Angelicas husband, by the consent of the Peeres. And how Angelica performing Hymens rytes, was stolne away by the king of Tunis . From whom she was againe taken by certaine Outlawes. Pollipus , newes was brought, that Remulus the King of Thrace , was landed with a mightie band of Thracians: and that Camillus was likewise landed with a band of Souldiers. With whom Sicheus sonne to the Emperour of Constanstinople had met, hauing with him a mightie band of Grecians. Marcellus hearing this newes, sent out Heralds to know the cause of their comming, who returned and certified him, that Camillus came to aide the king of Natolia , and that Sicheus and Remulus had brought those forces in the aide of Parismus , but being certified of the victorie the Bohemians had attained, and being assured of the peace was concluded, and of Maximus death, had sent backe their bands, but themselues with troupes of gallant knights were comming to the Court: Marcellus then sent out his Nobles to giue them entertainment. Angelica being now at libertie, came downe, attended by a gallant traine of bewtiful Ladies, by her sad countenance bewraying her harts sorrow, and with a most comely and kinde submisse gesture, welcommed Parismus , vttering these fewe words. Honourable Prince, regarding the deuoted dutie wherein I am bounde to your worthinesse, in that you are Parismenos father, I reioyce to see your safetie, though I haue cause inough to sorrow, my selfe being the cheefest meane of your disquiet, and by my vnluckie destinies haue bene the greatest procurer of these griefes. And since your noble sonne Parismenos for my sake, and by my fathers crueltie, hath endured many miseries, and death too by all likelihoods, I humbly desire you both, to remit all cause of discontent conceiued against vs: and also to vouchsafe me that fauour, as if you knowe of his abode or safetie, you would comfort my heart with that knowledge: for an exceeding feare of his death doth still trouble my sences, which if I were assured of, then would I soone resolue to followe him, for that without him, I am not, for in him I liue, and in his death my life consisteth. With that an exceeding ouerflowing of teares stopt the passage of her speech, that for inward hearts sorrow she could not vtter a word more. Parismenos beeing before minded not to discouer himselfe, seeing her teares, viewing the oft chaunge of her countenance, whereby he saw her heart was exceedingly opprest with care, now put off his disguise, being drawne with ioy for her presence, hoping for euer to enioy her without contradiction, and forced by a resistlesse desire to comfort her, and himselfe with her. When her eyes were full of teares, her heart of griefe, and all sad to see her sorrow, hee embraced her in his armes. With that Marcellus ran vnto him for ioy, the Ladies were glad, and the Nobles were contented with that pleasing sight: and within fewe daies cast aside all sorrow for Maximus death, because they had liued in disquiet, during the time of his raigne: onely the Queene rested still in heauinesse. Angelica hauing found her deare Knight, thought to stay no longer in that publicke assembly, but departed with Marcellus and Parismenos vnto her chamber. Parismus and Pollipus accompanied the Queene, vsing many perswasions to comfort her. Marcellus then being with Angelica and Parismenos , amongst many other speeches, could not forget Dulcia , on whom his thoughts were continually bent, enduring great care for her: for that he could by no meanes tell what was become of her, but feared that Maximus crueltie hadde sought her vntimely death, to whom Parismenos declared both where she was, and how shee came thither. Then Marcellus heart was reuiued with ioy, and both hee and Angelica rested in exceeding content. By this time Sicheus, Camillus and Remulus , were come to the Court, and Marcellus and Parismenos hearing thereof, went downe to welcome them. Amongst the rest, Parismenos yeelded Sicheus many thankes for his kindnesse. Marcellus gratulated Camillus friendship. And Parismenos with Remulus renued their former familiaritie. That by the approach of the estates and a number of Knights that attended them, the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian Court exceeded in royaltie, and all in generall after Maximus Funeralles were performed, remained in great ioy. The King of Libia after his discomfiture, hearing the report of these newes, departed towards Libia. Santodelodoro likewise sent home the remnant of his dismayed Moores into Barbarie , but himselfe stayed in the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian Court.

The time for the solemnization of the wedding beeing appointed, and much sumptuous preparation made against the day: the Knights making ready their costly Armors and rich furnitures for the triumph: the Ladies electing choise of rich attires, and ornaments to adore their bewties: Skaffoldes making to behold the Tylt: and euery ones mind repleat with ioy. And in this sort was eueryone busie to honor these nuptialls. The [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulians haue a custome, which is generally obserued amongst them, that the Brides the day before their marriage, offer Sacrifice in Hymens Temple, whom the married folkes adore as a god. Which superstitious custome, is in such vse, and of such high regard amongst them, that they account it not lawfull for any to marrie before they haue performed those rights, reputing them for accurst, that neglect the same, and esteeming them inricht with many blessings that execute those superstitions, with most deuotions. The manner whereof is this: The Brides are adorned with rich ornaments, and crowned with garlands of flowers, and in that sort they goe to the Temple, attended by one damozel, which carrieth their incense, which is balles of Frankensence, and rosewater, which themselues cast into the fire that burneth vpon the Alter: Which done, Hymens Priest sayeth certain prayers, and vseth to blesse them with many inuocasions, which likewise done, the Bride continueth after that, saying many praiers to Hyme , such as the Uotaries haue framed. Now the time of Angelicas and Dulcias wedding beeing come, for yt but one could at once do sacrifice, Dulcia was annointed to Hymens Temple the first day, & Angelica the next: which solemnitie Dulcia performed with great pompe. And the next day Angelica attiring her selfe in the vsuall sort, was attended to the Temple doore by Sicheus, Parismus, Camillus, Santodelodoro, Remulus, Pollipus, Pridamor , and many other gallant Knights, and by a gallant traine of courtly Damzels. And entred the Temple onely with Anna , whom she most dearely loued. The doore being fastned by the Priest, the knights returned backe to the Court, and the Ladies departed vntill the time of her returne, which would be within three houres. The Priest wanting something that belonged to the sacrifice, went into his house to fetch the same, where he was no sooner entred, but he saw certaine knights, who suddainly laid hands on him. The Priest maruelling at this outrage: demanded what they were, and wherfore they came, to whom one of them said: We come for Angelica , and her we will haue: therefore speake but a word more, and thou diest. With that one of the cheefest of them, commanded 2. of his seruants to keepe him fast. Which done, he alone with one more entred the Temple, where he found her staying for the Priest. Angelica seeing two Knights in Armor enter the Temple, was with that sight suddenly agast, fearing some trecherie, as indeed it fell out. For one of those knights came to Angelica , and tolde her, that she must goe with him. Which said: he tooke her by the hand to leade her out of the Temple: with that Anna began to shake and crie out, but the other Knights drawing forth a dagger, swore that if she did offer to cry he would split her heart. Ang . well understading, yt this villanous act was coplotted by trecherie, thus said, Uillain, what outrage is this thou offerest, whither wilt thou conuey me, what treason dost thou intend? Peace Lady (quoth he) for I must and will carrie you with me: neither make any resistance, for that which I came for, I will perform. Then he tooke her by the arme, and led her with force out of the Temple, into the Priests house, where she saw the Priest bound. And from out of his house, they conueyed her into a Litter, which was so close, that though she made great lamentations, yet she could not be heard, and causing Anna to mount vp behinde a Knight, they carried them away with the Priest: which they did so closely and with such expedition, that they escaped away vndescried, by reason the Temple stoode on the outside of the Cittie. Now this Knight that carried away Angelica , was the barbarous King of Tunis , named Irus , who long time before Parismenos arriuall in [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulia , had bene a suter to Angelica , but was denied her by Maximus , and departed from thence in a discontented vaine, who hauing soiournied many daies in [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulia , was well acquainted with their customes, and hearing all that had befallen in the Court, and of Maximus death, had many daies awaited this opportunitie, well knowing before that she would come to Hymens Temple, to offer the accustomed sacrifice: came at the very instant and surprised them, and hauing past without suspition out of the Subburbs of the Citie, hasted with all speed he could towards his countrie. And by the way as they went, they entred a thicke wood, where Irus purposed to rest himselfe, to determine which way to take, fearing to be surprised, for that he knew she would be soone mist: he had not stayed there long, but he was descried by certaine Knights that liued in those woddes: the cause of whose abode in that place shalbe declared in the next Chapter: who hearing many lamentations that Anna made, set vpon Irus : whom they thought to be a personage of great estate, by the richnesse of his Armor, which was on the skirts and sides enamelled and besette with rich stones, all ouer beset with bleeding hearts of Azure. Irus seeing himselfe thus beset, drew his sword in his defence, with that one of the company blew a horne, wherewith there suddenly came out tenne in Armour, who with the rest of their fellowes, equalled the number that was with Irus , betweene whom began a most fierce combat, which continued so long, that there were some slaine on both parties. Hymens Priest, in this time secretly stole away. And Angelica being in the Litter, looked out thereat, beholding that cruell fight, maruelling what those should be, that had stolen her from the Temple, and what those should be that sought to rescue her from them: but she was so exceedingly opprest with terror, that her vitall sences were ready to yeeld vp her latest breath. By this time Irus Knights were most of them slaine, and some greeuously wounded, sauing Irus , who being a Knight of resolued courage, continued the combat with great valour against his assailant, who seemed to be a Knight of exceeding courage, as he was indeed, and by his strength soone brought Irus within his mercie: who fearing his death, desired the Knight to hold his hand. Tell me then what thou art (quoth he?) I will not (quoth he) tell thee my name, but I am of Tunis. Angelica hearing that word, gaue a sudden shrike, wherewith the Knight looking backe, beheld her most exceeding bewtie, which was bewtified with her Garland of flowers, that he stoode as one amazed thereat, taking her to be rather a diuine, then a mortall creature: that he said. What Lady is this, that is fearefull to heare thy name? It is (quoth he) Angelica : with that hee fell downe for faintnesse, by effusion of bloud. The Knight then stepping to Angelica , said: Lady you now are mine by conquest: therefore feare not his name, and goe with mee, where you shall not want any thing that you will desire: with that hee tooke her out of the Litter, and caried her and Anna away with him, and left Irus amongst his Knights almost wounded to death, but three of them hauing escaped that cruell massacre. How Marcellus finding Irus knew him. Of Parismenos sorrow. How he departed in a disguise from Ephesus . How Parismus departed towards Thessalie . How Irus and Parismenos met in the desart, and what afterwards befell. Cittie: the Cittizens seeing him there, running as though he were agaste, whom they thought had bene at the Temple, for that Angelica was supposed to bee there euen then, wondred thereat: and many of them ra after him, who being come towards the court, met the Bridegroome, and all the rest of the estates going towards the Temple, who seeing him in that case, were driuen into admiration: but he casting himselfe before them, breath not suffering him to vtter any longer speech, cried out, Angelica, Angelica , and after that he had recouered a little more breath, hee cried againe: Angelica is betrayed, stolen and caried away by treason. With that Parismenos was so confounded in his sences, that hee was like one senslesse, and all the rest were dismaied with feare of this doubt till the Priest to satisfie them, declared the truth of all that happened, and how that he had left Angelica in the wood called the desart. Parismenos hearing his speeches, saide. What knight will bring me to that place? With that euery one ranne for their steeds, and Parismenos amongst the first, was first mounted, and with Marcellus posting towards the desart. Parismus, Sicheus , and all the rest, with inraged fury betooke themselues to their steeds, that on a sudden the whole Countrey was bespred euery way with knights. This newes likewise came to the Bohemian Campe, that the horsemen posted euery way, the Ladies ranne to the Temple, where missing Angelica , they filled the hollowe Uautes thereof with theyr cries, the courteous were amazed, the Citie in an vprore, and the Queene in great feare. Parismenos and Marcellus first gate into the desart, where according to the Priestes speeches, with little search they founde Irus amongst his fewe wounded knights almost dead, whose head they had vncouered to giue him breath. Marcellus soone knew him, and by his Armour which Hymens Priest had disciphered so wel as he could, he knew it was he that had carried away Angelica. Parismenos comming to him, being exceedingly inraged, offered to thrust his sword thorow him. But Marcellus staying his hand, said. This is Irus the king of Tunis . With that likewise he said to Irus , (who knew Marcellus ) King of Tunis , What dishonour is this thou hast done to Angelica ? That which I haue done (said he) I repent not, but for that I haue lost her. With that Parismenos saide: Where is she, which way went she? Then one of the wounded knights said, she was rescued from vs in this place, and the knights that haue her, departed out of the wood that way. By this time Parismus and Sicheus was come, and Parismenos & Marcellus , againe hasted that way the knight directed them. By this time all ye desart was beset & searched throghout with knights, and Marcellus & Parismenos were staied from the hast they made, for that they met with thousands of knights yt had bene in euery place, of those parts of ye country, but could not once hear of hir, or of any knight but of their own company, that Parismenos at Marcellus intreatie, returned backe to Parismus and the rest, to know their aduice before he went fro the, which Marcellus did of a great care he had of him, for yt he knew his greefe was such, that he would neuer returne vntill hee had found her, for whom likewise they should take as much care for him being absent. Parismus hearing the report of the Knights that had bin euery way in her search, could not tell what to say or what to thinke: but first, he desired those that loued Angelica to poste euery way in her search, and speaking to thousands of his Knights, he commanded them to depart presently, both into the furthermost parts of Natolia , and also into the neighbouring countries in her search, which hee thought was the best meanes to finde her, for he was sure they could not bee trauelled farre in that short space. Promising to reward him most richly that did finde her, or could heare of her abode: with that the Knights departed euery way. Parismenos was exceedingly tormented with greefe, and thought himselfe negligent to stay there, and not to be in her search: but not knowing which way to take, his sences were dulled with that greeuous conceit. To whom Parismus said: be of good comfort Parismenos , for we shall heare of Angelica againe: therefore I pray do not you leaue vs too, least care be as great for your absence: for there are so many knights in her search, that she cannot by any means be so secretly conueied hence, nor so speedily, but that we shall heare thereof. My Lord and father (quoth he) I beseech you let me make some diligent search for her, otherwise my minde will not be satisfied: and I beseech you to returne to the Court with these Nobles, and leaue me alone in her search, that amongst the rest, I that haue most cause, may according like a friend, do my best to finde her. As for my safetie take you no care, for be you assured I will preserue my selfe from danger onely for her sake, which libertie if you graunt me by leauing me here alone, it shall be a great deale more pleasing to my minde, then to be pendin the Court in idlenesse. If you promise me (quoth he) faithfully to returne againe, I will giue my consent, but yet go with vs to the court this night, and to morrow depart. I will my Lord (quoth he) returne to morrow: for this night I may sooner finde her then hereafter, for that notwithstanding our search, she may be in this Desart: which if it be so, they will conuey her hence this night. Parismus and the rest seeing his resolution, and trusting to his promise to returne, left him, and departed backe to the Court with Irus , for that the night drew nigh. Marcellus would haue staied with Parismenos , but that hee saw hee rather desired to be alone, that he likewise hauing as heauie a heart as any of the rest, departed. Parismenos being alone by himselfe, began to studie what to do, sometimes thinking she was within the Desart, where she might bee, for that it was of an exceeding compasse, then he remembred, that one of Irus Knights told him that they left the woode, which bred a contrary parswasion in him, that they were departed and gone some whither else, that in a multitude of thoughts not knowing what to do, and hauing in these cogitations spent most part of the night, without the least hope, at last tyred with greefe, and filled with care, he alighted from his steed, whom he fastned to a bush, and sate himselfe downe vnder a tree, as one that had been quite giuen ouer to carelesse dispaire: where wee will leaue him to speake of Angelica . The Knight that had rescued Angelica from Irus presently conueied her to the thickest of the Desart: in the middest whereof, he had a Caue, or rather Laborinth most artificially framed, wherein were diuers roomes, vautes, and turnings, not made by nature, but by the art and industrie of skilfull workemen, and with great cost. In which place in times past, the Giant Malachus kept his secret abode. Into this place they broght Angelica , and comforting her with many faire speeches, which were most harsh to her hearing, refusing all comfort, denying to taste any foode which they offered her, and shunning theyr company, till at last, the chiefest of them said. Lady, bee not thus impatient, nor vse me not so discurteously, as to shun my company, that haue deserued no such hatred, vnlesse it were in doing you good, for I haue released you from the bondage you were in, by meanes of those that had you in their custodie, that had as it seemed by Damozels complaints, with violence brought you to that place. For my selfe, I will vse you so honourably as your heart can wish: neither shall you haue any violence offered you, but rest in as good securitie as you can wishe: for this place harboreth no tyrants, nor discurteous creatures, but such as are of vertuous inclination, although by the crosse mischances of hard destenie, are driuen to liue in this place. And not so much by destinie, as by the crueltie of Maximus , King of this countrie, to whom neuer any offence was giuen by any of vs: for know Lady, that my name is Iconius , sometimes Duke of Sextos : but now bannished by your father Maximus from my Dukedome, by the false accusation of Pridamor , and the Kings malice, who accused me of treason and conspiracie with the King of Tunis , who long since attempted by treason to betray his life, and to attaine your possession: wherein the heauens know how innocent I was: and not contented with my banishment and confiscation of my goods, he also sought my life with great crueltie, promising great rewards to those that could find me out, or bring him my head. This is the cause of my desolate life, wherein I finde greater quiet then in Courtly pompe. Therefore I pray you be contented with such homely entertainment as my poore habitation yeeldeth, whither you are as welcome as you should be to the place you would desire to be in. Angelica hearing his speeches, was more greeued then before, for that she feared that he would in reuenge of her fathers cruelty still detaine her there, that with the feare she had taken by these outrages, such a passion opprest her heart, that she fel downe dead, and Anna seeing the same, cried out most lamentably, and did the best she could to recouer her, which when they had done, Iconius helped to conuey her to one of those roomes, very sicke and in great danger of her life, being diligently tended by Anna , who had all things necessary to comfort her in that extremitie, where there was no want of any thing. Iconius hauing left Angelica with Anna , came amongst the rest of his company, being knights of estimation, likewise by miserie driuen to that societie: hauing liued in that place many yeares, where they were as secure as in the safest place in the world, where they kept themselues close, not once stirring abroad, for that they knew the whole Court would be in an vprore for Angelicas absence: by which meanes the diligent search that was made, was all in vaine: for diuers knights had passed ouer the Caue, yet could not discerne the same, the entrances thereto were so secretly contriued, neither was there any direct path to be seene, for Iconius liuing in great feare of his life, was carefull thereof. Parismenos continued all that night, sometimes resting himselfe, and sometimes trasing vp and downe the sollitary Desart, where he met with many a furious beast, and heard the notes of many birdes that vse to flie abroade onely in the night, vttering many a sad groning sighe, and many a mournfull speech: sometimes lamenting his owne hard hap, and then her misfortune: not knowing whether himselfe or Angelica were more miserable, accounting himselfe most vnfortunate, to be parted from her, but her in much more miserie to be vnder the gouernment of straungers. Maruelling what they should be, that had rescued her from Irus , but most of all, to what secret place they had so suddenly carried her: finding so many causes of care, and so little hope of comfort, eyther by hope to finde her, or consideration of these sad euents, that his heart was repleate with feare: his head full of troubled thoughts: his sences dulled with sorrow, and his fancy ouerburdened with conceit: his body wearied, and his eyes swolen with griefe: that all the night nor the day finding no hope of comfort, he wandred towards the Court, like one not caring what he did, nor whither hee went: letting his steed carrie his head in carelesse sort, that he seemed to mourne with his maister: and being come to the court, he was kindly vsed and comforted by his father, and his friends. Marcellus and Remulus , by all the perswasions they could vse, gaue no ease to his restlesse cares: There was now such an alteration, as if all things had changed their hue: the knights that had prepared furniture, attire to adorne the wedding, had put on mourning attire: The Ladies that before reioyced, turned their ioy to weeping, and their pleasure into mourning: forsaking company, and chusing a darke corner to sit and weepe in. The cittizens whose hearts were on the height of delight, were now growne pensiue: and their countenances bewraied their griefe. The great preparations stood at a carelesse stay: neither going forwards nor backwards, and all things in such a confused alteration, as though all things had beene quite giuen ouer to alteration: that euen the vain sort of people that had delight to see shewes, were greeued to be frustrated of their desire. In this sort continued they all many daies, being voide of all hope, but onely to heare some welcome newes by such knights as were gone in search of Angelica , whose diligence they knew would be great in that behalfe. Many daies after continued Angelica in the Desart, very dangerously sicke, that Anna thought she could not by any meanes escape. Parismenos likewise continued in the Natolians court, vntill all the Knights that went in search of Angelica were returned, without any newes at all of her: which draue Parismenos into new thoughts what to do, for his care for her absence, and feare neuer to see her againe, made him wearie of his life, wearie of all company, and wearie of the court, which seemed to him no other then a place of discontent, and the sight of some of their mirth increased his woe, that he determined to leaue the court, and spend his life in some solitarie place: and at last, thought in the Desart where his loue was lost, to loose himselfe, and not to be found of any: which determination tooke such effect, that very shortly after, arming himselfe in a Murrie armour, hee secretly in an euening got from the court, and hasted with such speede as his steed could make, towards the Desart. He was no sooner gone, but he was assoone mist at the Court, for whose absence, great sorrow was made. And the next day many of his knights went in search of him, from whom he secretly shrowded himselfe, and sawe some of them, whom had they seene him, they could not haue knowne him in that armor. Thus many daies past in his search, but being still frustrated, they were all out of comfort, especially Parismus, Pollipus , and Marcellus , were very sad: but yet in hope of his safetie, though they knew not where he were, for they were assured hee absented himselfe of purpose. Within fewe daies there were certaine knights that brought Letters out of Bohemia to Parismus , which certified that his father the King was very sicke, and likely not to liue long, and desired him to returne, which caused Parismus to leaue the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian Court, and gaue order to Pollipus to returne with the Bohemian souldiers, being vnwilling to leaue Parismenos behinde him, but for that hee sawe there was no remedie to recure the least of these euills, or recouer him, for that he absented himselfe voluntarily, and his was peraduenture trauelled far from ye place, Parismus taking farewell of the rest of the accompanied, by Sicheus , first hauing let Irus depart, and forgiuing his offence for his part, he departed, leauing Marcellus very sad for his absence. After his departure, Marcellus sent away the king of Tunis , vpon certaine conditions betweene them concluded. Remulus sorie for Parismenos and Angelicas misfortune, departed towards Thrace . And Camillus and Santodelodoro to their countries. And within fewe daies after, Marcellus was with great solemnitie wedded to Dulcia , the preparations being exceeding, but yet so darkened by the absence of Parismenos and Angelica , & the rest of the states that had bene assembled, that it seemed like ioy and mourning intermingled. Irus being departed from the Natolian Court, glad of his safetie, for that before he feared his life: but much more sad, for that hee was disappointed of Angelica , by the way as hee returned to his country (being vnaccompanied) he entred the Desart, his minde being drawne yet with desire to see the place where hee lost her: neare vnto which place Parismenos remained, who espying Irus , presently knew him, and thinking that hee had escaped from the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian Court by stelth, thought now to be reuenged of him, for that he alone had by his trecherie onely crost his contented happinesse, rowsed himselfe from his couert: and pacing towards Irus , who was likewise on foote, for that he could not enter the wood on horsebacke, and drawing his sword, without speaking one word, let driue a forceable blowe at him, which lighted vpon the well tempered steele, yet brused the flesh vpon his arme. Irus being therewith inraged, drew out his sword, betweene whom began a most fierce and cruell battell, which continued a good space, till Irus had receiued some greeuous wounds, and maruelling at his enemies valeur, thus spake to him. Knight (quoth he) what art thou that offerest me this outrage? I know thee not, neither haue I offended thee. I am (quoth he) Parismenos , the greatest enemy thou hast: and do so mortally hate thee, that I will haue thy life before I part: with that he assailed him most greeuously, and gaue him so many mortall wounds, that with effusion of blood, he fell downe dead. Parismenos hauing brought him to this estate, espied another knight comming out of the wood, which made him leave Irus , and follow him, and ouertook him at the woods side, to whom he said: Knight what art thou? The knight looking backe, seeing his sword bloodie, and his armor battered, seeming to haue come from some cruell skirmish, and disdaining at him to bee so peremptorily examined, answered. What art thou that examinest me in this place? Parismenos being exceedingly inraged before by the smart of some wounds he had before receiued, said. I am one that will know what thou art before I leaue thee: and with that word, strook at him. The Knight likewise drew his sword to reuenge that blowe, but hee was farre vnable to withstand Parismenos , that he was soone by his vnconquered Chiualrie most greeuously wounded, and in some part disarmed: Parismenos striking a forceable blowe at him, hit him right where the armor was broken, and with violence the sword pierced his heart, and he fell downe dead, without speaking a word. Which done, Parismenos pulled off his Helmet, to see if he knew him, but he knew him not. Sir Iconius hearing the noise of the clashing of their armour, being then abroad, drew towards the place where Irus lay gasping for breath, whom he presently knew to be the same Knight, from whom he had before rescued Angelica , and pulling off his Helmet, presently knew him to be his deare friend Irus , for whose sake hee was banished. That taking him vp, he coueyed him to the Caue, with great diligence labouring to reuiue him, which by his industry he at last attained. Anna comming to a sight of this Knights comming in, presently knew him by his armor to be the same that had with violence taken her and Angelica out of Hymens Temple, and enquiring of the Knights his name, they answered, none of them knew him, for none but Iconius knew him. Angelica being now somewhat well recouered, Anna tolde her what she had seene, but could not learne the Knights name. Anna (quoth she) neuer enquire his name but view him well, and thou shalt soone finde him to be Irus , King of Tunis : for diddest thou not heare him say, that hee was of Tunis , when Iconius rescued me from him. Being much more miserable by his approach, for Iconius and he are of such familiaritie, that whereas before I had almost woon his consent to conuey me to the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian court, I am now out of of all comfort of that, for Irus will seeke to conuey me rather into Tunis , that now I feare me I shall neue see my beloued knight Parismenos , but must be subiect to his power, who I know wil according to his barbarous disposition, vse mee badly: that I know not Anna what to doo in this extremitie, but rather then I will subiect my selfe to his will, I will rather be the executioner of my owne death, and first rip my accursed heart out of my troubled brest. Anna then comforted her by many perswasions, putting her in some hope, yet in the end to attaine a happy issue to all these vnfortunate euents, Parismenos hauing slaine the knight, returned to the place where he left Irus , but found him not, which made him maruell what was become of him, thinking that he was escaped and fled. And againe being wearie and somewhat wounded, he got himselfe to his secret couert, where he determined to spend the rest of his life: where he continued many daies after, in which time Irus being in the Caue with Iconius , had recouered his health, and knew Iconius his olde friend to bee the man that had before endangered his life by taking Angelica from him, and leauing him to Parismenos , for which hee had now made him amends, by bringing him to his caue that was likely to perish, that when he came first to the knowledge of these things, he vttered these speeches. How fortunate am I good Iconius , to fall into your kinde hands, that otherwise could not haue suruiued. I haue long since heard of your banishment from the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian court, and onely for my sake, and withall, heard how stricktly Maxi . sought your life, who being come to my knowledge, I sought diligently to find you out, with intent to haue carried you with me into Tunis , but since I haue now so happily found, and haue much more cause to loue you: let me intreate you to leaue this Desart, and depart with me to Tunis , where I will prefer you to greater dignitie then euer you had in [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulia . I thanke you (quoth Iconius ) but I maruell what misaduenture hath now brought you into this countrey, and especially into this place, vnaccompanied, with such hazard of your life. Friend Iconius (quoth he) I will declare vnto you the truth of all. Then he declared the truth, how he stole Angelica out of Hymens Temple: and how she was rescued from him in that place. And withall, declared all that he knew of the estate of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulia : and his latest comming from thence: and how he met with a knight in that wood, that had brought him by his valiant behauiour neare death. Iconius hearing the report of his aduentures, made him this answer. Pardon me Noble Irus , for it was my selfe that tooke Angelica from you, not knowing what you were, who is within this Caue. Irus hearing his speeches, caught him in his armes for ioy, saying. My deare friend Iconius , was it you that tooke Angelica from me? how was it that I knew you not, nor you mee and how fortunate, and ten thousand times blest may I be by your means, if you will continue my trustie friend, as heretofore you haue beene, by letting me but haue a sight of Angelica ? My Lord (quoth he) againe, I haue not forgotten nor once diminished my former friendship, but wil commit the custodie of Angelica to none but your selfe: for none but your self are worthy of her, or none so worthy: onely if you please to follow my counsel, do not at ye first, motion your former sute vnto her, but vse her kindly, and rather for a time dissemble the extremity of your passion: for I perceiue she is most deepely inthralled to the Bohemian Knight Parismenos , that to make any other loue to her at the first, wil rather increase her affections: but when she is without hope of finding him againe, then time will soone alter her mind, for womens affections are variable. Irus then tolde him, that hee did like his counsell exceedingly well: and withall, yeelded him many heartie thankes for his most true and loyall friendship. Iconius being parted from Irus , came presently to Angelica , whom he vsed most kndly. And taking occasion, for that hee found her weeping, he said. Faire Angelica , I maruell why you torment your selfe with these greefes, when you see your selfe in safety, and out of daunger: haue I yet deserued no better opinion at your hands, that haue beene so carefull for your health and safetie? I beseech you abandon this sadnesse, and entertaine some rest to your vnquiet brest, which I see is ready to bee ouerwhelmed with greefe. Iconius (quoth shee) what heart opprest with so many cares as I haue indured, could refraine from griefe? what eyes that haue beheld such crueltie, can abstain from sheading infinit floods of sault teares? or what creature subiect to such miserie, could containe his sences within the boundes of reason? And when al these are happened, and so many occasions of discontent concurred togither, yet in the middest, one mischiefe greater then all the rest is befallen to me. Is not Irus that cruell King of Tunis within this Caue, my enemie, my liuing foe that hath brought me to this miserie, who is your professed freend, to whose counsell you will rather yeeld, then any way confirme your promise to me past, to conuey me to the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=39032001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD636D0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Getulian court? but if you remaine constant, then I haue the lesse cause to feare Irus : but if you condiscend to be ruled by his wicked perswasions, then I know my sorrowes will be euerlastingly lengthened. Iconius hearing her speeches, thought it best to gloase with her, and therefore made her this aunswere. Good Lady cast aside all such feare, for Irus shall not so much ouerrule me, as to make me falsifie my word: neither do I thinke he is of any such disposition: but if he be I care not, for what I haue promised I will performe: and would haue done it before this time, but that your health would not permit the same. Many other speeches past betweene them, till at last Iconius left her, and going to Irus , told him all the speeches that had passed betweene him and Angelica : who by Iconius counsel dissembled his affection: and though he were often in Angelicas company, he made no shew of such earnest loue, yet carelesly made recitall of his former deuosions, which he so cunningly dissembled, that Angelica began to rest in assurance of Iconius fidelitie, and in a perswasion that Irus had giuen ouer his hotte loue, and by that meanes began to gather more comfort to quicken her abated spirits which by reason of those troubles she had past, and her late sicknesse, were brought into a weake operation. And many daies it was before shee had fully recouered her health, which Iconius still made his excuse to frustrate her desired departure. Parismenos likewise all this time wandred vp and downe the desart, liuing poorely vpon hard and wilde frute, and lying vpon the earth in his armor, that the haire which then began to bud, had with a carelesse growth shadowed some part of his face, which was growne to a great length, and his complexion so much altered by care, that he could hardly be knowne of those that were familiarly acquainted with him before. In which time of his continuance in that place, he had at seuerall times met with Iconius consorts, and slaine them, because they refused to yeeld to him, and denied to declare what they were, hauing taken an oath and made a firme vow with Iconius before, not to reueale, which they religiously kept, though in other matters they obserued no ciuilitie. At last, Parismenos met with an other of their fellowes, which he set vpon, and soone brought in hazard of his life: but he being of a more cowardly disposition then the rest, fled, and with much ado escaped from Parismenos . And comming to Iconius , told him what he had seene, and how he was handled by a strange Knight, or rather a Sauage man that haunted the Desart: then Iconius willed him to declare what Armour he had. That can I not do (quoth he) for the same is so ouerworne, olde, and battered, that neither the colour nor other deuice therein can be discerned. Assuredly (quoth Iconius ) it is this knight that hath slaine so many of our company as we haue found dead, which maketh me thinke, that he is some distressed knight, or banished as my selfe is, which maketh me pittie his case, and could wish he were with vs: which peraduenture might giue him some comfort. Many other speeches they had of him: being yet of no minde to seeke him out, which Iconius determined to do afterwards. And thus continued Iconius consulting with Irus , how to win Angelicas fauour. Angelica likewise rested in hope, that Iconius would conuey her to the court: and Parismenos continuing his sollitary and austere life in the Desart. How trecherously Irus vsed Angelica . How he was murdred by Anna . And of Parismenos arriuall at Iconius Caue. How hee rescued Anna from a most violent death: and other accidents that befell. Afterwards when Angelica had fully recouered her health, Irus thought the time now most fitliest serued to insinuate himselfe into her fauour, for the fierce flames of his restrained affections did furiously boile in his brest: by Iconius counsell, would he oftentimes frequent her company, but in such sort, as that he seemed to pittie her passions, and would oftentimes enter into discourses of great penitencie, for his outrage committed against her: but in such sort, that he craued her good opinio of his good intent towards her. This behauiour he vsed so long, that Angelica began to conceiue well of him, and to remit some part of her conceiued displeasure, and also her feare of his further crueltie: And many times Iconius and all the rest beeing out of the Caue, left Irus alone with Angelica , who behaued himselfe in such decent sort, and with such kinde behauiour towardes her, that Angelica thought he had vtterly abandoned his former rude and vnciuill behauiour. Iconius afterwards, one day being in talke with Irus , espied one of his associates come in greeuously wounded, who declared that he had met with a straunge Knight, from whom hee had hardly escaped with his life. Iconius hearing his speeches, was much troubled in his minde to know what hee should be, that within some three dayes after, making Irus priuie to his intent, went out of the caue, accompanied by all the rest of his fellowes to him, and left Irus alone in the Caue. Who after Iconius departure, seated himselfe downe in a melancholie studie, thinking himselfe too foolish to liue so long in the sight of his beloued Angelica , without any hope of her fauour, and also began to perswade himselfe that Iconius had some other intent then he made shew of, which might disappoint him of obtaining her custodie, and then began to recall to his secret viewe her diuine perfections, which thoughts inflamed his heart with such desire, that the loue and earnest affection which hee hadde by Iconius good counsell restrained, burst out into an exceeding inflamed lust: that hee presently went into the place where Angelica was, who expected no other profer of behauiour, but that which he had before vsed, suffered him to sit downe by her, and entred into communication with him, as formerly she had done, but he hauing his mind meditating how to satisfie his desire, beheld her exceeding bewtie, with a greedie eye, and deuoured the piercing power of her conquering bewtie, with such desire, that it augmented his affections, and set on fire his new intended purpose, to attaine the conquest of her loue, and the possession of her person, that he seized his hand vpon hers, grasping the same sometimes strictly, and then againe playing with her daintie fingers, setling his eyes vpon hers, making a sad sigh a Prologue to his speech, he said. Most diuine Lady, pardon me if I presume beyond the bounds of your fauourable license, to touch your precious hand: or if I enter into speeches that may disagree with your fancie, or shew the integritie of my deuotion: but for that I rely vppon your benignitie, and haue long time by feare to be offensiue, rather indured inward and secret torment, then vpon presumption to procure you any disquiet, haue concealed my loue, dutie and affection, to your perfections. Now finding you at leisure, and feeling my owne torments increase: I humbly beseech you pittie my long continued greefes, and grant me some fauour to reuiue my heart with comfort: for you know that I haue bene long time inthralled to your bewtie, and bound to apply my fancie to merit your fauour, which loue hath euer since continued constant and immoueable, and will still so continue whilest my life doth last. Which loue, compelled me to that boldnesse, to bring you from the Natolian Court, with intent to carrie you into my countrie, and there to make you the Gouernesse and ruler of me and mine. And now that you haue had this tryall of my constancy, what neede you denie me your fauour, considering there is no knight liuing hath attended your liking with more feruencie. Angelica hearing his speeches, would haue taken her hand from him, but he still held the same, whilest she answered. I had thought you had forgotten your former desire, & wold not haue troubled me with the same: but especially now when you see I am not to make any change of the choise I haue already made. Therefore I should account it great wisedome in you, to abstaine from desiring that which you haue beene so often denied, and see so much vnlikelihood to obtaine: for would I now yeeld my selfe to please your fancie, I should dishonour my name, my stocke, and reape perpetual ignominie and scandals to my selfe and you: and besides by my disloyaltie, breed euerlasting discord and war betwixt you and the noble Prince of Bohemia , who is of such force and inuincible strength, that hee would waste your countrie, and neuer giue ouer vntill hee had wrested me out of your possession: therefore, I pray you giue ouer your sute, which may (if obtained) bring so many adherent miseries and inconueniences, as you will soone repent you. I beseech you (quoth he) let not vaine suppose of Parismus strength, or Parismenos reuenge, procrastinate my desires: for I esteeme them as nothing in my countrey, beeing of sufficient strength to beate a mightier foe backe. Therfore sweet Lady grant me your loue, without the which I cannot liue: and armed therewith, I shall be of sufficient strength to refell any foe: therefore deny me not. Which said, hauing her had still in his, he pulled her to him suddenly, & clasping her in his arms, he by his strength, tooke from her a sweet kisse: with which she was so much vexed, that with a suddaine start. she sproong from forth his armes and fearing to be againe so surprised, would haue departed out of the roome, which he perceiuing, hauing armed himselfe with impudencie, ran after and caught her in his armes, & by force broght her back, whilest she strugled to get from him, but he being too strong for her, held her so fast yt she could not stir, but with cheeks as red as scarlet, said. If euer you expect fauour at my hands, leaue off and do not seek to attain my loue by violence, for if you do, I sweare by heauen, I will rather suffer you to teare my heart in peeces, then yeelde you any fauour: therfore, if there be any vertue, humanitie, good nature, or curtesie in you, let me go. Irus was nothing disswaded with her speeches, but now that he had begunne, lust and immoderate desire vrged him on, that he held her the more strictly: and by constraint bereft her of many kisses: with that she gaue such shrikes, that the hollow vawtes of the Caue rung therewith: and Anna came running in, before whose comming, he vsed her so vndecently, that she cried out vnto Anna for helpe, who vsed her vttermost indeuour to rescue her mistresse from foorth his power, and shrowde her from dishonour, which with most violent and vndecent behauior he proffered, and at last she gat from forth his hands, wearied with resistance, and falling down vpon her knees, said. Irus be not so inhumane as to dispoyle me of my honor, but desist from this shamelesse impudencie, which will make you odious in the sight of heauen. What will my life do you good, which with that is lost? what pleasure can you reape by this violence? Or what benefit can it be to you to spill my blood? Seeke not my loue in this sort, which will turne that good opinion I had of you to hatred: and if you will needs haue the fruition of my loue, let it be in honourable sort, and not with such rudenesse: with that a flood of brinish teares ranne downe her cheekes: whilest hee stoode ouer her like a furious Lyon ouer a silly harmelesse Lambe, readie to deuour the same. Euen so Irus stood readie to seize vpon her againe, his heart panting with striuing, and his vaines swolne with desire, no more mollified with her lamentations, then the hardest Adamant with the fall of soft snow. And casting a most bitter countenance on Anna , who stood not far off, and only hindred his lust, he sodenly caught his dagger in his hand, and ranne after her to haue stabd her, which caused her with an exceeding outcry to runne out of the roome, and he after her. And Angelica calling after him, staie good Irus staie, and when he was returned, she as fast flying from him: And seeing Anna out of the roome, he caught hold of her and pulled her to him, holding his dagger in his hand, whilest she laie trembling at his foot said, Angelica , my resolution is to obtaine thy loue, either by force or faire meanes: therefore giue consent, or I vowe I will neuer desist though it cost thy life. Angelica hearing his speeches, said. Irus , good Irus , let me alone, and vse me not thus shamefully and vndecently, and I will tell thee my minde, for were it not for thy vsage, and this vnciuill rudenesse, being neuer before in my life so vsed, thou mightest peraduenture haue had a greater fauoure with my consent: therefore I pray be not so inhumane, and thou shalt see I will do more with gentlenesse, then all thy rudenesse can compell me too. With that he turned himselfe from her whilest she rose from the ground, she was no sooner vpon her feete but her sences failed her, and the liuely redde, faded out of her crimson cheekes: euen whilest Anna cried, helpe, she fell downe in her armes dead: then Irus with Anna , did the best he could to recouer her, beginning to waxe madde with griefe, for within short space she began to drawe in her sweete breath againe, and lifting vp her eyes, with a greeuous sigh, she said. Oh Irus , cruell Irus . Then Anna seated her vpon the bed, and she said. Irus I had not thought you would haue vsed me thus cruelly, but haue showne some signe of vertue in you: And rather then you shall offer me any more such violence, I promise you that I will depart with you to Tunis , and I will yeeld my selfe to be in honourable sort at your direction. Angelica (quoth he) giue me possession of your loue, which is that I desire, and without that I cannot be satisfied. Why Irus (quoth she) will nothing satisfie you but my dishonour? What rage ruleth your minde, what lust is that possesseth your heart? Is this the honourable minde should be in a king? Good Irus be not so cruell. I am not cruell, and it is but folly to stand vpon termes of deniall. Irus (quoth she) then let me request this one fauour, leaue me alone some space, to conferre with my maide, and I will send her for you ere it be long. Irus being in some hope to attaine his desire, finding her speech so gentle, thought that her maide would perswade her rather to yeeld, then to hazard his furie, tolde her he would doo that at her request, and so departed. Hee was no sooner gone, but Angelia with weeping eyes, wringing her hands, and making exceeding lamentation, intreated Anna to counsell her what to doo. Mistresse (quoth she) if you could with faire promises cause him to desist vntill more conuenient time, or that you could delaie him off vntil Iconius returne, then there were some hope to escape. Oh Anna (quoth she) if he come in again, it will be impossible, his fierce and desperate beastly rage is such, therefore if thou louest me, doo one thing at my request, and I shall thinke my selfe satisfied. Mistresse (quoth she) whatsoeuer it be I will doo it. Nay but Anna , thou shalt sweare, or else I wil not trust thee, neither will I reueale it vnto thee. Deare Mistresse (quoth she) I sweare by heauen and all happinesse, I wil performe the vttermost of your will. Then Angelica taking vp Irus dagger, which he had carelesly left in the flore, gaue it her and said: I account my honour dearer than my life, and had rather die in this place, then liue in continual shame and reproach hereafter: therefore Anna , I charge thee by all the dutie and loue thou bearest me, by the honour thou owast to chastitie, and by the oath thou hast made, to sheathe that Ponyard in my breast, to ridde me from his tyrannie: which if thou refusest to doo, my selfe will without intermission execute. With that Anna clasping fast the dagger in her hand, with her eyes ouerflowing with teares, said. Mistresse, I vowe by heauen I will neuer execute that deed, neither shall your selfe doo it: but first giue me leaue to trie if I can perswade Irus from his purpose, with that taking the dagger in her hand, she went out to seeke him, but he being gone from Angelica swolne with lust, and panting with striuing, laide himselfe downe vpon his bedde, meditating on that he had done, and what further pleasure he should reape, if she gaue her consent, his desire being somewhat asswaged by his late striuing with her, and his sences ouercome with these meditations, he was fallen a sleepe, lying vpon his backe, his doublet vnbuttoned, and he yet sweating, in which sort Anna found him, and comming to his bedde side, seeing him fast a sleepe, hauing his dagger in her hand, thought to sticke the same to his heart: with that an exceeding trembling affrighted her heart, and all her bodie and ioynts shooke for feare: but remembring how cruelly he had vsed her mistresse, & what a desperate case he had left hir in, & what outrage he might intend, hauing giuen the but litle time of cosideration, and withall, ye Angelicas life & her owne were likely to satisfie him, and nothing else, but most of all, finding so fit an opportunitie to be for euer rid of him, shee lifted vp her hands thinking the heauens fououred her, and and allotted that as a meanes to preserue Angelicas honour, praying the heauens to strengthen her: ayming right at the middest of his brest, which was vnbuttoned, with both her hands she smote the dagger so far into his brest, that the poynt appeared at his backe, with which hee gaue an exceeding grone, and starting vp whilest she fled, hee pursued her, feeling himselfe mortally wounded, & followed her euen into the roome where Angelica was, by which time his vitall sences decayed, and hee fell downe dead, tumbling in his goare: with that Angelica gaue an exceeding shrike, not knowing what Anna had done: But viewing him, she perceiued ye dagger goring his brest, & Anna told her what she had done. With that Angelica was exceedingly affrighted, and said. Anna , how shall we now be rid of his hatefull carkasse? Sweete mistresse (quoth Anna ) be you of good comfort, and and let me alone: with that arming her selfe with vnwoonted boldnesse, whilest her hands shooke and trembled with feare, she tooke him by the heeles and dragged him foorth of the Caues mouth, and tumbled him into a pit hard by, casting a great many of Leaues and Mosse ouer him, that his body was quite couered from sight: which done, she returned and tolde Angelica what she had done. Angelica seeing her selfe thus fortunately rid of Irus , whose furie had brought her life in danger, said. O Anna what power was it that animated and strengthened thee to that boldnesse? and how shall we satisfie Iconius at his returne, who loueth Irus so well, that he will soone misse him? and if he know what we haue done, we shal be in some daunger of his furie. Thus do my misfortunes daylie increase, and one miserie followeth in an others necke, to augment my cares. What thinkest thou is become of Parismenos ? doest thou not thinke he taketh my absence greeuously? yes I feare me Anna he is too ready to surfet with griefe, and thereby may much indanger his health: and besides, I perswade my selfe, he is wandred from the Natolian Court into farre countries in my search. If Iconius finde how we haue vsed Irus , then will he for euer detaine vs here. How often haue I beene crost in my loue, being now in worse case then euer I was, and more vnlikely to come to enioy my Parismenos , then when my father imprisoned me so closely in the Maiden Tower. No time yeelds me any rest to trouble: no place giueth mee securitie: nothing but sorow is allotted to my portion, and nothing but endlesse and perpetuall miserie awaiteth my steps. Deare mistresse (quoth Anna ) I beseech you adde comfort to your hart, for I wil vndertake to satisfie Iconius , and make a currant excuse for Irus absence: that howsoeuer it falleth out you shall be no way troubled therewith. In diuers such speeches they continued vntill the night drew nigh, and they expected Iconius returne: where we will leaue her. Iconius being gone out of the Caue, with intent to finde the strange Knight, sought vp and downe most part of that day before he could finde him: but at last, passing by the place where he had rescued Angelica from Irus, Parismenos espied him, hauing but two knights at that time with him, & came out vnto him. Iconius espying him, comming to him, said. Knight I haue wandred all this day to seeke you, but was frustrated till now: the cause was, for that my Knights were sometimes slaine, and often wounded by your valor, that maketh me desirous to know the cause of your discontent, being willing to do you what pleasure I can, and also to be acquainted with you: therefore I pray let me know what you are? I am (quoth he) a miserable wretch, ordained to euerlasting torment, banished from ioy, exiled from content, wretched, and vnfortunate. I seeke no company, nor desire acquaintance: I care not for ease, but discontent pleaseth me best: this life I leade not by constraint, but that none so well agreeth with my fancie: care keepes me company, and this Desart is fittest for me to dwell in. Sir, (quoth Iconius ) it seemeth some great mischaunce hath driuen you voluntarily to take this course, or else the crueltie of friends hath exiled you their company. Both (quoth he) but what are you that seeke so much my acquaintance, and knowledge? I am (quoth he) a man as miserable as your selfe, subiect to many misfortunes as your selfe, & euery way filled with discontent: if I should name my selfe you know me not: hauing liued many yeares in this Desart, a disconsolate and disquiet life, my habitation being but simple, whither I came of purpose to bring you: for that your Noble Chiualrie maketh me honour you, where if you loue to liue in discotent, that place yeeldeth nothing but sadnesse, yet with securitie. Parismenos hearing his speeches, began to maruell what hee shuld be, hearing him say he had liued many yeares in that Desart, thought to see his habitation, and therefore, said. Sir Knight, though I know not whether I may with securitie or no, trust your kindnesse, yet if you will vouchsafe mee such kindnesse, I will accept thereof, and for a time, contrary to my purpose, take some ease. Sir (quoth Iconius ) you shall vpon my faithfull promise, rest voide of trecherie, and be as secure as my selfe: these speeches past, they departed towards the Caue, continuing the way in some conference, where they arriued euen at such time as Angelica had ended her speeches: and being entred, Iconius told Parismenos , that was his habitation, whither he was welcome: then stepping into Angelicas roome, he thought to haue found Irus there: but seeing her heauinesse, and in what sort both she and Anna by her sate weeping, he came vnto her with kinde behauior, demanding her cause of sorrow: but she casting downe her eyes to the earth, made no answere. With that he bega to suspect Irus had done her some wrong, & maruelling that he could not see him with her, nor in the other roome, hee presently searched all the Caue throughout, and not finding him, he returned to Anna , and asked her if shee could tell where hee was? who made him answere, that she knew not where he was now: but that he had bene there not long since. With that, casting his eyes down to the earth in a studie, he espied the floore stained, & besprinckled with blood, that therewithall his heart began to swel. And looking with a fearefull countenance, he asked what blood that was? with that Angelica cast downe her eyes, and Anna blusht, but he beeing earnest to know, demanded againe what bloud it was? Anna then answered, it is some of Irus blood, spilt by himselfe. Why (quoth hee) did he that deed? Because (quoth she) Angelica would not consent to his lust. Where is he now (said he?) I know not answered Anna , neither do I care. With that, Iconius perceiuing the trackt of blood that went out of the chamber, followed the same to his bed, which he found all bestained therewith: and againe, followed the blood to the Caues mouth, that he was assured that Irus was slain, that in a monstrous rage he ran in againe to Anna , saying. Irus is murthered, and you haue done the deed. Anna then knowing her selfe guiltie, stood as one confounded with feare: but at last, reuiuing her selfe from her dumpes, she said: If I did murther him, I did it but to saue my owne life, and Angelicaes honour. With that he was so inraged, that he drew his sword, and in a furie would haue slaine her, but that she with speede ran out of the roome, and he after her, ready to strike her dead. Parismenos hearing that noise, and seeing Iconius pursuing the Damozel, being of a quicke conceit, euen as the blowe was discending, stept vnder the sword, and caught the blowe, which otherwise had parted her life. Iconius being inraged, strooke an other at him, till Parismenos drawing his sword, said. Holde your hands, and know whom thou strikest, or I will gore my sword in thy heart blood. Pardon me good Knight (quoth he) rage made me forget my selfe. What Damozell is that (quoth Parismenos ) you would haue slaine? It is quoth he) one that hath murthered my deare friend. By this time, some of the rest had caught Anna and brought her backe, when Iconius offered againe to haue slaine, but that Parismenos hauing seene her countenance, knew her: and staying Iconius againe, said. Be not so rash without aduice, to lay such violent hands on a silly damozel, and before you execute reuenge, be aduised, and first know the truth of the fact she hath committed, and vpon what occasion she was vrged thereto. I will not (quoth Iconius ) follow your counsell, but shee hauing confest the deed, I will be reuenged by her life, and nothing else shall make satisfaction for his blood, which shee hath shead. Discourteous knight (quoth he) art thou void of humanitie, or doo I wish thee to do any thing that disagreeth to reason? I sweare by heauen, let but a haire of her head perish by thy accursed hand, and thy death shall be the raunsome: here do I stand in her defence, and therfore, the proudest of you al touch her, and if you dare. With that Iconius said: Doest thou requite my friendship in this sort, to take part with my enemies? or tell me, doest thou know that Damzel, that thou standest so peremptorily in her defence? I do nothing but that which euery Knight is bound vnto: which is, to defend Ladies wrong: neither do I know this Damozel, but will defend her, for that she is a Lady, vntill I may know, whether you offer this outrage against her wrongfully, or by good desert: which once tried, doo then what you will with her. Then Iconius said. Damozell, tell me why thou slewest him? Anna made this answere: he offered violence to Angelica , and with his poniard attempted to slay her: who will tell you the truth of all. With that they altogither went into the roome where Angelica was. Parismenos beholding her, had much ado to withhold himselfe from bewraying what he was: but yet with constrained forbearance, he stood and heard her declare Irus wicked behauiour, and in what manner she had wrought reuenge against him. With that Iconius said: wicked woman, couldest thou not haue wrought some other meanes to disappoint his intent, which I can hardly beleeue, but that thou must murther him? heauen nor earth shall not shrowde thee from my furie, for being the vntimely death of that louing, kinde, and couragious King: neither shall any thing but thy destruction appease my wrath for the losse of my deare friende Irus . Parismenos hearing him name Irus , said: Was it that trecherous and disloyall villaine Irus , that slaue? damozel thou hast well reuenged the wrongs he hath done me, vpon his owne accursed head: and therefore I will be thy defence, and sheelde thee from harme: for had I met him my selfe, I would haue done no lesse then thou hast: for he was the most dishonourable Knight that euer drew breath. But tell me (quoth he) to Iconius , what art thou that offerest such cowardly violence to restlesse Ladies, and imprisonest them in this sort, and also bearest so disloyall a minde, as to vphold him in his villanie? Iconius was so inraged with his words, that he said: Base: villaine, did I but lately take thee vp as a runaway, and brought thee to my Cell, of pittie to succour thy distressed estate, and doest thou thus requite my kindnesse, to become my examiner? Parismenos hearing his speeches, so much disdained them, that he let driue at him with irefull violent blowes: and with such furie, that he draue Iconius backwards out of the roome, and withall, gaue him so many wounds, that had not some of his associates stept to him, he had been slaine: when three of them at once assayled Parismenos , but by his inuincible valour, first one of them, and then another lost their liues: which Iconius seeing, he would haue stayed to speake to him, but his heart being set on reuenge, and desirous to haue the possession of Angelica againe, followed his fight with such rigor, that he had well neare slaine Iconius . By this time some of the other came in, who seeing Iconius in such daunger by the valour of that one knight, admired his chiualrie, and stept to rescue him from his violence, which when they had done, Iconius said, Knight, tell mee what thou art, that knowing thy name, I may know whom it is I resist? My name (quoth he) is Parismenos . With that Iconius flung away his sword, and said. Most honorable knight, I yeeld my selfe to your mercie, for that verie name do I honour, vowing that it is against my will, that euer I offended you. Parismenos hearing his words, said. And if thou beest my friend, (quoth he) I am sorrie, not that I met thee, but that I haue hurt thee: which said, he entered into the roome where Angelica was, & comming to her, not being able to vse any delay, but forced by desire to comfort her heart, by giuing her knowledge of his safetie, pulling off his helmet that she might beholde his face, said. My deare Ladie Angelica , behold your poore friend Parismenos. Angelica then knowing him, with a modest behauiour clasped her armes about his necke, and sealed a number of sweete kisses vpon his lips which don, and withrawing her armes againe, her eyes melted into a riuer of teares, and afterwards said. Welcome my deare Lord Parismenos , ordained yet to be my blisse. Well haue I now preuailed against calamitie, for your sight hath banisht him my brest: how miserable and daungerous was my estate once this day, and how happie, and tenne thousand times blest am I by your presence? If you do account your selfe happie by my presence (quoth he) for euer shall you be happie, for neuer will I part from your sight. But ten thousand times more then happie doo I account my selfe, to bee so esteemed of you, that haue neuer deserued such fauour, but by my ill fortune haue brought you into these calamities. Good Parismenos say not so, for not you, but my vnluckie destinies haue ordained mee to some sorrowe, but in the end haue repaid me double fold with sweete content. In these and such like speeches, did they expresse their ioyes for each others presence and preseruation, till Parismenos buckling on his helmet againe, went out to see whether Iconius did pretend any treacherie against him, but him he found vnarmed, and his knights dressing his wounds: and seeing Parismenos still armed (as fearing to disarme himselfe) he gaue him such assurance of quiet both by his owne firme vowe, and the protestations of all the rest, that Parismenos rested in some assurance of peace, and Iconius after his wounds were dressed, came with him into the place where Angelica was, and said. Most diuine Ladie, I beseech you pardon my offence: I confesse I loued Irus well, because he was my dear friend, and finding no such misbehauiour in him since I first knew him, I could not beleeue her report, vntill I saw you iustifie the same, and for amends I offer my selfe to be at your disposition: desiring you to remit my proffered offence for Irus death: and withall, I beseech you make no doubt of my good meaning, for that I haue bent my whole indeuours with trueth to be at your commaund: neither harbour any farther conceit of violence to be offered you in this place. Hauing ended those speeches, he presently caused good meate to bee prepared for them, and they were serued in as decent and cleanly sort as could possibly be deuised in that place. How Parismenos gate shipping for Germanie . How they were betrayed by Theoretus . And how after a tempest and hard escape from drowning, they were preserued by a Fisherman of Thessalie . whereof, hadde before long time opprest his heart with care, and hauing refreshed themselues with the repast Iconius had prouided, whilest Iconius and his seruants went (by Annas direction) to the place wher Irus bodie lay, to burie the same, he tooke Angelica in his armes, solacing himselfe in the viewe of her attractiue beautie, amongst the rest vttering these speeches. My deare loue, I trust you will pardon my speeches, if they proceed from a bolder familiaritie then heretofore: for that now hauing obtained your gentle consent to perpetuall loue, and hauing dedicated your selfe as mine to dispose of, I shall not feare in boldenesse to call you mine owne: and assume such interest as you haue kindly graunted. Now these misfortunes are thus ouerblowen, though with your miserie which hath beene my torment, I beseech you, banish from your minde the remembrance of al former sorrow, and repose your confidence in my fidelitie: for since I haue inioyed your presence, nothing shall make me part from you, no not so much as out of your sight: neither will I (vntill I haue conducted you to the place I most desire) by no misaduenture be drawne from you, neither is my mind now in quiet, for that (notwithstanding my show of credece) I giue no trust to Ico . trueth, but wil trust him so far as I tryall of his loyaltie, and not otherwise: but to morrow morning, so pleaseth you, we will leaue this place, and betake our selues for some course of securitie: for I see that being in this countrey, I shall neuer be in securitie, but many will seeke to crosse my content, though I may repose assured confidence in your vertuous kindnesse, which hath beene extended far beyond the bounds of my desert: and Marcellus friendship I know is firme, and that I might I am sure repose my life with assured confidence on these firme foundations, yet I feare me, that some misfortune or others will still crosse our content: and againe, when we thinke our selues in most securitie, turn our happinesse into aduersitie: that I know not well what course to vndertake that may agree to your liking, and giue me any assurance of quiet. Angelica perceiuing that many cares opprest his heart, in regard of her welfare, and seeing with what affection he tendred her quiet, she made this answere. My beloued Lord, how infortunate may I account my selfe in this, that my misfortune procureth you so much disquiet: I beseech you rest in assured confidence of my constancie, that shall continue inuiolable for euer, being subiect to so many misaduentures, that I haue both procured my owne, and your most miserable torments: being of the minde that you are, that this countrie will neuer yeeld vs securitie: therefore if you can aduise me to take any other course with you, that may giue vs any assurance of rest, be assured, that notwithstanding to attempt the same, might incur thousands of inconueniences, I will most willingly vndertake the same, and with more constancie then you can impose vpon mee: therefore I beseech you, counsell me of any course that shall agree with your fancie,  & that & nothing else shall please me, for I commit my self wholely to your disposition: and therefore as you determine of your selfe, so determine of me, for I account my selfe no other then your selfe. Parismenos made this answere: Then Lady, I thinke it best we seeke to forsake this countrie quite, and trauell towards Bohemia , where I dare assure both you and my selfe of quiet and rest. I am quoth Angelica ) wholely to be directed by you, and my desire is no lesse then yours, to attaine that heauenly place: for I account both parents, friendes and countrie, as nothing in respect of the loue and dutie I beare to you. After these speeches past, Iconius was returned from burying Irus , whose minde Parismenos felt in these speeches. Now is the time, that the Princesse Angelica and my selfe must make triall of your friendship; which is, your consent and company to a matter of importance, for our departure out of this place. My Lord (said Iconius ) whatsoeuer it be to pleasure you and the Princesse, if it lie in my power to further the same, I vowe and protest to vse my vttermost indeuour therein. Then this it is (quoth he) Angelica and my selfe are agreed to leaue this country, and not to returne to Ephesus , for diuers occasions that I will hereafter make you acquainted withall: but to trauell towards Bohemia , and afterwards giue Marcellus knowledge of our safetie: therefore I aske your counsel of the best course to be taken for our furtherance herein. My Lord (replied Iconius ) to vndertake the trauell by land, would be ouertedious and dangerous, by reason of the long space betwixt this and Germanie , and the many rude and Sauage Wildernesses we must passe by: therefore, I thinke the best course is, to get shipping, which may land vs somewhat nearer the country, and then our iourney by land shall be the lesse. And to that effect, I haue this to further vs: Certaine Merchants of Italie haue continuall traffique in this countrey, with whom we may get passage thither, and beeing there, our desire is more easie to bee obtained: and the place where those Italian ships doke at Roade, is not farre hence, but that with a little labour we may bring the Princesse thither. I like your counsell most exceedingly well (quoth Parismenos ) but how shall we come to haue conference with those Italians? My Lord (said he) let that be my charge, and so please you, I will depart to put the same in execution presently, and you in the meane time may remaine with the Princesse, and be assured of my fidelitie, for heauens grant my ouerthrow, if I deale not faithfully: with that he departed, and Parismenos returned to Angelica , spending the time with her in great content, vntill Iconius returne. Early the next morning, Iconius returned to the desart, and certified Parismenos of that which he had done, which was this: There was then in the harbor, a ship of Italy , that was readie to depart towards that Countrey, vnder the gouernment of Theoretus an Italian Marchant, with whom Iconius had agreed for their passage, not telling him what they were that should go with him, and withall, promised to returne that forenoone, or not at all. Parismenos hearing his speeches, was exceedingly glad thereof, and presently made Angelica acquainted therewith, who most willingly gaue her consent: and presently they departed towards the hauen, being in all but eight persons. And comming to the ship, they were kindly receiued of Theoretus the Maister. Who hauing sped his voyage, and hauing no other thing to staie for, the winde seruing, hoysed saile, and with a mery gale, they launched into the deepe. Parismenos comming to Theoretus , demaunded which was the nearest course for Germany , for that he was bound thither? Sir (quoth he) if it so please you, after I haue landed in Italy , and dispatched some businesse I haue there of importance, I wil be then readie to conuey you to the nearest hauen that lyeth towards those parts, so that you will content me for my voyage. My friend (quoth Parismenos ) if thou wilt doo me this friendshippe, I will content thee to the vttermost of thy demaund. Then he returned to the place where Angelica was, comforting her with assured trust of a happie and speedie voyage. Many dayes they continued on their course with prosperous successe, til Theoretus assured them he was within two dayes sayling of Italy , where accordingly he arriued, where Parismenos and Angelica refreshed themselues, vntil Theoretus had ended all his businesse, and was growing to a composition with Parismenos . It fortuned that there was then in the place where they arriued, a Knight of Slauonia , named Arenus , who had secretly beheld Angelicas bewtie, and was so surprised therewith, that he began to deuise what meanes to vse to possesse her, and hearing that they were bounde for Germany , and supposing Parismenos had bene her husband, he vsed the more expedition, his desire being growne to that extremitie, tn the small time of their abode, that he thought impossible for him to liue without the fruition thereof. And oftentimes growing into conference with Theoretus , hee vnderstood the truth of all by his report. And Arenus finding some hope to bring him to condiscend to his practise, vpon a time he beganne to commune with him, and in the ende concluded with him for a sum of money, to conuey them for him into what place he would. With whom Arenus dealt so cunningly and so strictly, that he bound him by many oathes to performe the same: which he for greedinesse of the summe of money, was most resolutely determined to doo. Now the time of departure being come, Theoretus (with a dissembled countenance colouring his intended villanie) came to Parismenos , and tolde him that his businesse was now ended, and the winde fitly serued for their departure. Parismenos being glad thereof, and hauing before agreed with him for the price of his passage, brought the Princesse aboord, with Iconius and the rest, where they found Arenus , whom Theoretus told, hee was one yt was likewise trauailing vnto some part of Germany . Parismenos little suspecting their drift, accepted of his company, and vsed him kindly. Arenus put on such an outward shewe of vertue, and framed himselfe to such a kinde of behauiour, that Parismenos grew into great good liking of him, and into such familiaritie, that he tolde him what he was. Arenus hearing that he was sonne to Parismus , then grewe into protestations of reuerence and dutie that he bare to him, and into many such other like vowes of dutifull regard, that Parismenos related to him the whole summe of his estate, and what the Ladie Angelica was. And some two daies they past in this sort: Parismenos and Angelica with a ioyfull heart going towards their miserie, and nothing misdaubting Theoretus trecherie, thought themselues sayling towards Germany , when indeed they were a quite contrary way. When suddenly an exceeding tempest arose, and the windes began to blow and rage exceedingly, the raine began to fall in such abundance, that the shippe was readie to be drenched with the same. Which cruell tempest continued for the space of two dayes and two nights, in that most raging  & extreme sort, that there was none but expected present destruction: then began Parismenos to curse himselfe, for leauing the country of Natolia : and committing himselfe to the mercy of the seas, of whose furie he had before tasted. Angelica was in great feare of her life: Theoretus conscience began to accuse him of villanie: and Arenus to repent his trecherie: & whilest they were in this extremitie of feare, the ship wherin they were, was by violence driuen vpon a Rock, and there split in sunder, that they were all driuen to shift for their liues. Prismenos beeing amazed with this misfortune, yet had an especiall regard to the Princesse, whom he caught in his armes, and with her gat on to a peece of the ship, yt with the violence of the sea, was parted from the rest, which was not likely long to support them. And the rest, some drowned, and some by other admirable meanes preserued. When presently the storme began to cease, and the sea suddenly grew calme. It chanced, that a Fisherman was not far off in harbor, who beheld this shipwracke: and withall speed, seeing the storme ceased, hasted with his boate thitherwards: and first came to Parismenos and Angelica , who euen then were ready to perish: for Angelica affrighted with the terror of death, being with feare and weakenesse not able to support her selfe on the peece of the broken shippe, was fallen off, whom Parismenos held vp by her garments, being with euery little motion himselfe ready to ouerturne, and so to perish togither: to whom the fisherman approched, and by the diuine prouidence came at that instant to preserue their harmlesse liues, and tooke them both into his Boate, and at Parismenos request, hasted to saue as many as he could possible of the rest. When presently Parismenos espied Anna tumbling vp from vnder the water, whom by good fortune hee caught hold of, and drew vp to him: who by that shee had auoided abundance of water out at her mouth, began to reuiue: by this time, the Fisherman had gotten in Iconius and Theoretus , both of them being in great danger of death, or in a manner dead, but all the rest were quite drenched, and neither they nor any part of the shippe to bee seene: presently the Fisherman conueyed them to the shore, not farre from which place, was his house, whither likewise, after they had all recouered their sences, he broght them. Parismenos glad of the fortunate escape, and seeing in what weake estate the Princesse was, desired the olde Fisherman and his wife, to do their vttermost to succour them in that distresse: and hauing a speciall regard to Angelica , he with the olde woman named Dorella , disrobed her of her wet ornaments, and the olde woman put her on drie linnen, the best she had, and got her into a warme bed, which greatly reuiued her abated sences. Dorella likewise had the like care of Anna , being of such a good and vertuous disposition, that of her owne pittifull inclination, she would haue hazarded her life to succor them. Iconius by this time was perfectly come to his sences, but Theoretus still remained in great hazard of death. How Osirus hearing of Parismenos landing in Thessalie , caried him to his castle. By what vnexpected meanes Dionisius, Parismus, Oliua , and Laurana , met them at a banquet. How they were with pompe conueyed to Thoebes , and afterwards married with great royaltie. All things beeing in as good order as might bee, and Theoretus as well cherished as could bee in that place, the night began to approach, when Parismenos being in the chamber with Angelica , drying himselfe by the fire, vttered these speeches to the Fisherman. Good father, what recompence shall I euer be able to make you for this kindnesse, by whose means our liues are preserued? but assure your selfe, that hencefoorth I will prooue so gratefull, that you shall not say, but your guests were as friendly in rewarding, as you were kind and liberall in succouring vs. And because you shall not bee ignorant to whom you haue done this friendship, know you, that you haue saued the liues of two yong Princes. The old man hearing his speeches, told him, that all that he had should be at his commaund. In these and many other speeches they spent the euening, til Dorella had prouided their supper, and drest the best meat she had, to comfort Angelica , who was well reuiued and chearefull, in whose companie Parismenos and the Fisherman and his wife staied all that night: because indeed there was no other bedding: in which time Parismenos comforted Angelica with many speeches, who was onely glad to see him in safetie. Early the next morning, Theoretus hauing with much adoo gotten into the roome where Parismenos and Angelica were, and feeling himselfe past hope of life, vttered these speeches. Most noble knight, I humbly beseech you, to pardon and forgiue that greeuous and hainous offence, I haue committed against you, and that most vertuous Ladie, by the instigation and inticement of Arenus , who was a knight of Slauonia , with whom I had agreed for a summe of mony, to conuey you into his countrie, whose intent was to betraie that Ladie into his keeping: but both his wicked intent, and my reason is now by the diuine prouidence preuented, and my selfe left to your mercie, beseeching you to pardon my monstrous misdeede: which when he had said, and they but a small time considered of his treacherie, and their admirable preseruation, euen when Parismenos was readie to speak to him, he gaue vp the ghost and died: which when they beheld, the olde Fisherman presently conueyed him out of the roome, and afterwards buried him. Parismenos then growing into a deepe consideration of his estate, and withall, what perils he had ouerpast, entred into these speeches. Was euer man so vnfortunate as I am, to bee toste with so many miseries, and driuen from place to place, yet can attaine no harbour of quiet? Were it my destinie to indure these torments alone, then could I with more patience ouerpasse them, but all that euer came in my companie, are with mee subiect to the like misfortune: would wee were now againe in Natolia , for I am further from my hope of attaining to Bohemia now, then I was then: wee are now driuen past our knowledge, into a straunge countrie, and farre from all meanes of redresse. Could I but finde meanes to send to Bohemia , to giue my noble father knowledge of my aboade, then might I bee in some better hope of safetie. Angelica seeing his sadnesse, accompanied his complaints with teares, which augmented his sorrowes to a greater degree, that hee was readie with her to shedde some teares, but that his manly heart woulde not suffer him. Dorella beeing by and hearing his complaints, wherein he named Parismus , (whom shee had heard married the Princesse Laurana ) to bee his father, could not be in quiet, vntil her husband was come in, to whom she declared what she had heard. The olde man hearing that, presently came into the place where Parismenos was, and said. My Lord, my wife telleth mee, how that you named your selfe sonne to Parismus , which maketh mee bolde to aske you whether she said true. Good father (quoth hee) I am sonne to Parismus : but what maketh thee thus desirous to knowe that? Because (quoth hee) I know that noble Prince, and would not doubt ere long but soone to bring you where he is: for knowe most noble Prince, you are come into Thessalie , where Dionisius is King. And moreouer I assure you, that both Parismus and the Princesse Laurana , are now in this countrie, at the Court in the Cittie of Thoebes . The occasion of whose arriuall heere, was by reason Dionisius was extreamely sicke, and sent for them, who came thither not many daies since. Parismenos heart was so reuiued with his wordes, that hee embraced the olde man with exceeding ioy, beeing scarce able to containe himselfe within the compasse of moderate reioycing, then comming to Angelica , and taking her by the hand, hee desired her to bee of good comfort, for that their estate was farre better then they before thought it had beene: whose heart was likewise reuiued in a sudden disposition, to a comfortable affectation, for whereas before shee was terrified with the feare of drowning, possest with a wearisome conceit of further trauell, driuen into a straunge and vnknowne place, far from her desire, and contrarie to her expectation: and withall, sawe Parismenos sad & carefull heart opprest with much greef, whih greeued her more then all the rest. But now being in safetie, and in Thessalie , where she should soone meet Parismus and the Princesse Laurana , the thing she most desired, and also seeing all her sadnesse turned to ioy, and euerie thing fallen out most prosperously, euen according to her hearts content, shee seemed like one newly reuiued from death to life. And with Parismenos and the rest of that small companie reioyced exceedingly, casting aside all further shew of discontent, and spending the time they had to stay there in great pleasure, the rather for that Angelica, Anna , and Iconius , were now in perfect health. And on a time Parismenos seeing nothing to hinder his determition, demaunded of the Fisherman, how farre it was to the Cittie of Thoebes . My Lord (quoth he) it is some twentie myles. Which is our best way to trauell thither (quoth Parismenos ?) My Lord, it were much for that faire Ladie to trauell thither on foote, but if you would be ruled by me, you should go to a Noblemans house within two myles, whose name is Osirus , the onely man that the king loueth, who I know will bid you welcome, and furnish you with all things necessarie and agreeable to your estate, being indeed the most kindest Nobleman in the world. Angelica (quoth Parismenos ) of of this Nobleman haue I heard my father Parismus and the noble Pollipus giue many commendations, therefore so pleaseth you, we will go to his house. I am exceedingly well contented (quoth Angelica .) My Lord (quoth the Fisherman) so pleaseth you, I wil giue him knowledge of your being here. Do so (said Parismenos .) The Fisherman then presently hasted toward Osirus Castle, and soone arriued there, and being brought before him, declared all that had happened. Osirus at the first gaue no credence to his speeches, therefore hee said. My friend, thou bringest me newes that I can hardly beleeue: therefore tell me how thou knowest it is Parismenos ? He hath tolde me that he is sonne to Parismus , and the Ladie that is with him, is daughter to the king of Natolia . Osirus then presently commanded his Gentlemen to mount themselues, his Ladie likewise named Vdalla , and her Ladies and Gentlewomen, were suddainly in a readinesse, and all things necessarie to conduct them with the most state that might be, was prepared, and in that sort with exceeding ioy they rode to the poore cottage that shrowded such noble personages, which the Fisherman soone gaue Parismenos knowledge of, who presently went foorth to meete Osirus , and at the entrance of the doore he met him, and with a courteous behauiour they saluted each other. Osirus saying. My Lord, because I knowe you not, I beseech you pardon me, if I demaund whether you bee the Prince or no? I am (quoth he) the most vnfortunate Parismenos , neuer made happie till this houre. Then said Osirus : In all dutie I bidde you welcome then into Thessalie , which will account it selfe most happie by your arriuall. Vdalla then came and embraced him, showing by her behauiour, manifest token of ioy for his presence. Then they three togither went in to the Princesse Angelica , whom both Osirus and his Ladie, saluted with most reuerent behauiour, desiring her to leaue that place, and soiourne in their Castle, whither she should be as welcome as heart could wish: whose kindnesse both she and Parismenos accepted with many thankes, and in most stately manner departed thitherwards. The Ladies attending on Vdalla , saluted the Princesse with great reuerence, growing into such admiration of her beautie, the like whereof, they neuer behelde in any but the Princesse Laurana . Parismenos would by no meanes leaue the olde Fisherman and Dorella behinde him, but tooke them along with him, hauing a special regard to reward them kindly, that had preserued his and Angelicas . life. Angelica and Parismenos soone arriued at Osirus Castle, where they were so sumptuously and suddainly entertained, as that they exceedingly admired the Noblemans bountie: and beeing entred the Hall, they beheld many stately descriptions of the famous acts of Princes of Greece : and amongst the rest, the whole Historie of Parismus warres with the Persians : so liuely portraicted, that it would haue held them with great delight to behold the same, and comming into the inner roomes, beheld them so richly furnished, that they grew into admiration thereof, whither Osirus and Vdalla welcommed them with such heartie kindnesse, that they could not chuse but growe into an admirable conceit of their honourable, liberall, and vertuous inclination to true honour. There was a most costly banquet furnished with all sorts of precious delicates made readie, whither they were within short space inuited, there they heard the sounde of most sweete musicke, and beheld the hearts of the whole companie belonging to Osirus , as it were reuiued with ioy for their presence, which filled their sences with an vnwoonted content of delight, which by reason of the former miserie they had indured, seemed a heauen of happinesse, and a Paradice of pleasure. And in this sort they spent that day, and at night were conducted to seuerall lodgings. Parismenos by Osirus , and diuers knights that soiorned in his Castle, and some that attended him. Angelica by Vdalla , and many other gallant Ladies and beautifull Damozels, with exceeding statelinesse and courtesie. And being alone by themselues, sauing that Anna was Angelicas bed- fellow, which roome she was not to resigne, till Parismenos should take possession of the same: he on the one side meditated on his happie fortune to arriue in that place, and admired Osirus courtesie, and was most of all affected with ioy, that Angelica was so kindly welcommed to that straunge place, being farre from her owne friendes and countrie, that he did not onely reioyce at their kindnesse for his owne part, but especially for hers, whose content hee wisht and desired more then his owne: and withall, being now assured that Parismus and Laurana were both in Thessalie , his heart was so fully possest with desires content, that he seemed not to lack any thing hee desired, but onely to enioy Angelicas sweete, diuine, and pure loues possession, which hee was likewise in assurance to enioy within short space. Angelica on the other side, spent some part of that night in communication with Anna , which added a delight to her sences, relating her misfortunes past, her happie preseruation, the courtesie and gentle good nature she founde in the Fisherman and his wife, which caused her to conceiue a perswasion by the kinde and bountifull entertainment shee had found in Osirus , that the Thessalians were people of an exceeding courteous disposition, whereas many other people, both poore and noble, were rude and barbarous, that shee thought her selfe a thousand times blest, that shee had made choise of so honourable a knight as Parismenos was, and one that was sprung from the race of such noble Parents, and such naturall, kinde, and louing subiects, that her heart with these cogitations, seemed to be absolutely happie, and her sences were filled with such delightfull content, that in these heauenly meditations, she fell into a quiet and ease full rest. The next morning Osirus and Vdalla were vp, readie to vse their vttermost indeuours to shewe their liberall goodwill: but the Princes kept their beddes longer then vsuall, for that on the one side, they had spent much of the night in the meditations aforesaide: and on the other side, hauing beene a long time troubled with carefull cogitations, their sences being now at rest, they slept with great quiet. And at such time as they were awaked, had all things in such ceremonious kinde, and stately manner ministred vnto them, that they could not chuse but admire the same, being loth to motion their departure to the Court, least Osirus should thinke they did not accept of his kinde entertainment. Whilest all remained in this delight in Osi. castle, report had blazed into the hearing of diuers of the knights of the kings Court, the ioy & great feasting was kept by Osirus , which was reported in such sort, that they were assured some great personages were arriued there, but none knew who they were, that this newes was so open in the Court, that it came to Dionisius hearing, who most of all maruelled thereat: and hauing now fully recouered his health, determined for recreation after his sicknesse, onely with Parismus and some fewe of his knights, to progresse secretly to Osirus castle both to recreate himself, to know what those should be he entertained, & especially for that he loued Osirus exceedingly well: which determination he made Parismus acquainted with, & the next day accordingly performed the same, (which was the third day that Parismenos had been with Osirus .) And being arriued at the castle euen about noone, he and Parismus entered, whom the Porter well knew, and presently Dionisius (not suffering any of his seruants he met, to giue Osirus knowledge of his approach) mounted the staires into the great chamber, where euen then Parismenos, Angelica , and all the rest, were seated at a most costly dinner. Parismus still stayed with the rest of the knights without the doore, Osirus soone espied Dionisius , and suddainly starting from his seate, vpon his knee did his reuerence: Vdalla and the rest that knew him did the like. Whilest Donisius said: Osirus , you see a bolde guest comes without bidding, but if you had beene kinde, you would haue made me partaker of your mirth. Parismenos was so amazed, that a good while he could not tell how to behaue himselfe, but perceiuing that it was the king, hee with Angelica drewe towards him, and humbly prostrated themselues before him vppon their knees, being vnable by the suddainnesse of their ioy to speake. Dionisius not knowing them, and maruelling to see them kneele, was halfe astonisht, vntill Osirus to ridde him from that doubt, saide. My Lord, this knight is sonne to the noble Prince Parismus . Before hee could say any more, or Dionisius once salute them, Parismus was entred, who at the first knew Angelica , and by her his sonne, whom otherwise hee should not haue knowne, he was so much altered, whose suddaine sight, so vnexpected, and so farre from his thought, and so contrarie to his expectation, and so impossible to his perswasion, made him transformed into a kind of admiration, whether it might bee possible that it was they, or that it was some elusion: but Parismenos likewise espying him in such a studie, immediately rose from the ground, and vpon his knee did him reuerence, and Parismus embraced him with a most kinde, louing, and ioyfull behauiour. Angelica likewise knowing him, bent her deuotions with all humble reuerence to shewe her loue and dutie, whilest hee raised her from the ground, and embraced her in his tender armes, beeing vnable to expresse his ioy to see them there. Dionisius likewise embraced them with great kindnesse, and welcommed them with teares of ioy. Oftentimes folding Parismenos in his armes with a louing behauiour, and holding Angelica by the hand, beeing loath to let the same goe, and vnable to expresse his inward ioy, that he, Parismus and all the rest, were possest with such content, as would aske a skilfull penne to describe. Their welcomes, kinde embracings, gentle speeches, and other signes of contented ioy, were such as passeth my vttermost skill to relate, or descipher. Dionisius then desired them to seate themselues againe at their banquet, and he and Parismus would beare them company: then they againe seated themselues, and himselfe by Angelicas , side, vsing her so kindly, so louingly, and so familiarly, and with such exceeding mirth, pleasantnesse, and merrie countenance, that Angelicas heart was possest with ioy thereat: Parismus admired the same, Parismenos reioyced thereat: And Osiris and Vdalla tooke exceeding ioy thereat, hauing not a long time seene him so pleasant. They would haue waited, but he commaunded them to sit downe and be merie. The noble men that came with him, which was Lord Remus , and diuers others, he commaunded to sit downe, vttering these speeches. My noble children, the ioy I conceiue for your presence is such, that it filles my sences with exceeding content: & were Oliuia and Laurana here, I would make account this were the best, most pleasing, most contented, most royall, and delightfull day that euer befell: but since they are absent, let vs be merrie: Osiris bidde vs welcome, for we are all your guestes. Parismenos and Angelica welcome into Thessalie : welcome to your Grandfather, and so welcome as your hearts can wish. Parismus who would haue thought these had bene with Osiris , what fortunate destenie hath broght them hither? or how are they so happily met to meete vs here? Well, did but Oliuia and Laurana know of their being here, they would not be absent. He had no sonner ended that word, but Oliuia the Queen, and Laurana , entred the chamber (the newes of his secret departure from the court, and his intent, being tolde to them, they followed him to Osiris Castle.) To whom Oliuia said. My Lord, it reioyceth me to see your highnesse so merrie. Dionisius hearing her speeches, suddenly started, and seeing her and Laurana , said. No maruell though I be merrie, hauing the faire Lady of the Golden Tower by the hand. With that the whole company rose from the Table, and Parismenos knowing his mother, reuerenced himself before her vpon his knee, whilst she (knowing him) imbraced him most louingly, not knowing how sodenly to reioyce sufficiently. Angelica not knowing, but supposing that was Laurana , her heart being only vowed to Parismenos , thought it her dutie to reuerence his parents so much as himselfe: therefore with him she did reuerence to the Queene and Laurana . And after many greetings, salutations and welcomes past, Dionisius againe vttered these speeches. I know that all here present are exceedingly glad for the safetie of these two young Princes, then laying apart all salutations, which cannot suddenly be exprest, let vs once againe and this third time, seate our selues to this banquet, and leaue all other ceremonies while afterwards, for we are determined to bid them welcome: and they shall know that we loue them. But first let vs refresh our stomackes with Osiris costly cheare, and afterwards we will desire to know the occasion and maner of their arriuall into this Country, which was neuer absolutely happie before this time. Then they all seated themselues againe in great content, Dionisius not suffering Angelica to sit from him, but close by his side, betwixt him and the Queene, euery one expressing exceeding ioy for their vnexpected safetie and arriuall in that Countrey. After dinner was welnie ended, which was ouerpast with pleasurable content on all sides, and was performed by Osiris in great pompe, Parismus desired Prismenos to declare what misaduenture had befallen him, since his priuate departure from the Court at Ephesus : and by what occasion they arriued in that place. Then Parismenos declared the truth of all, how he met with Angelica , of Irus death, of Arenus and Theoretus treason, and of their preseruation by the Fisherman, which greatly delighted them all to heare. Dionisius then said, which is Iconius ? Then Parismus called for Iconius , and he presently came: whom Dionisius, Parismus and the rest, vsed most kindly. And the Fisherman and his wife were by Dionisius highly rewarded, and afterwards promoted to great dignitie. Some two dayes they altogither staied in Osiris Castle, spending the time in exceeding mirth. And at last, with great royaltie departed towards the Court at the Cittie of Thoebes . Where there were infinit numbers of people with ioyfull hearts gathered togither to welcome them: expressing such ioy as is not to be described. And afterwards Parismenos and Angelica , in the presence and assembly of Marcellus, Remulus , the King of Hungary , the King of Sparta , and diuers other Noble personages, were with most exceeding royaltie affianced togither. And after Dionisius was dead, Parismenos was Crowned King of Thessaly , and liued all his life time in great quiet and blisfull content, with the faire Angelica : Increasing the honourable fame and dignitie of the Kings of Theslaly : hauing one onely sonne and a daughter. Whose fortunes and aduentures, filled the whole world with their Fame.
