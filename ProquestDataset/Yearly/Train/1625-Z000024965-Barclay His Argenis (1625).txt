 I haue aduentured (though, I confesse, with more confidence than iudgement) to shew them in a dimme perspectiue. This rude peece, such as it is, hath long lyen by me, since it was finished; I not thinking it worthy to see the light. I had alwayes a desire and hope to haue it vndertaken by a more able workman, that our Nation might not be depriued of the vse of so excellent a Story: But finding none in so long time to haue done it; and knowing, while it spake not English , though it were a rich iewell to the learned Linguist, yet it was close lockt from all those, to whom Education had not giuen more Languages, than Nature Tongues: I haue aduentured to become the Key to this piece of hidden Treasure, and haue suffered my selfe to bee ouer-ruled by some of my worthy friends, whose iudgements I haue alwayes esteemed, sending it abroad (though coursely done) for the delight and vse of others. I was the more encouraged in this Resolue, that I might shew my gratitude to your selfe, whose many fauours though I come farre short of euer deseruing; yet I haue alwayes had the ambition to shew, by my best endeuours, that your loue and bounty hath not beene lost vpon me. Gratitude is a running Streame, perpetually paying Tribute to his Lord the Ocean, that first filled him. And though I come not in so deepe a Current as my desires would offer; yet in my shallow murmur I haue brought you these waters, not that I desire to bee counted able, but thankfull for your accumulated fauours. Vouchsafe therefore, I beseech you, to accept vnder your Patronage this vnpolisht worke, whereunto if you shall bee pleased to giue the least approbation, I shall not despaire of the more fauourable censure of others. The Originall it selfe, (not to speake any thing of my paines, wherein yet, I hope, I haue faithfully, though not curiously, rendred the History) is, besides the excellence of the Language, not one of the least esteeme that are extant of this kind, both for pleasure and profit to the Reader; which is the true end of euery learned Writer. It is so full of wise and politique Discourses, and those so intermixed and seconded with pleasing accidents, so extolling Vertue and depressing Vice, that I haue sometimes compared it to a greater Globe, wherein not onely the VVorld, but euen the businesse of it is represented; it being (indeed) such a perfect Glasse of State, that I cannot suppose, but euery Reader will be drawne by the delight of something in it, to reade the whole. Now my end, in this publication, is not for any vaine hope of praise to my selfe, which, I am not so weake, as not to perceiue how little I deserue it; but onely to leaue testimony to your selfe and the world, how much I am Yours in all obseruance, Which neyther fits my mind nor thy desert. So differing I would from a Poet be, As to speake truth, and yet I would prayse thee. Th'hast done a good worke, well; as one that drawes The Copy of a Piece, wherein the Lawes Of Art are all confin'd, yet in that draught Thou rather add'st to them, then they lose ought. 'Tis rare: for Bookes translated doe, like Silke Twice dy'de, lose glosse; or, like remou'd Trees, welke. Each Language hath a selfe-propriety, Wherein the Parent, as his phantasy Best likes his Issue, may apparell it: But to prouide a various dresse, and fit That to anothers Childe, commends thy skill: Which, changing colour, keep'st the beauty still. When I would reade for pleasure , or to spy Wisdome , with Worth , and State-Philosophy , Ile court thy Argenis : who by thy paine Is naturaliz'd: and doth in English reigne: Vnder whose sway, this wonder shall appeare: The World (which is as best but one lowd Iarre) Shall be aton'd: and now all shall agree, To thinke this work well done, and so praise thee. Ovv: Fell: And Argenis doth liue, despite the fire That through the World did blaze her Martyr'd fate; For which the limping god was curst of late; But our Translator, nor his friends compare, With what another could; I onely dare Promise th'ingenious, if they will bestow Their paines to reade, content; Let Criticks know 'Twas neuer meant the Presse; but now 'tis out, I thinke he could not (that first went about To vndertake it) haue more truely hit The Authors purpose; or in phrase, or wit; But thy knowne modesty doth checke my Pen, And bids mee leaue thy prayse to other men, Whose learning better can thy worth approue; Though not my iudgement, yet accept my loue. N. C. OR , The loues of Poliarque and Argenis .  The arriuall of a young Stranger in Sicily : the request of a Lady to him to succour Poliarchus ; how hee vanquished fiue Theeues.  stoop't to Tiber: when a young man of excellent feature, was by a forreine Ship, landed on that part of the Sicilian shore, where the Riuer Gelas disburtheneth himselfe into the Sea. His seruants, by the Mariners helpe, landed the warlike prouision of their Master, and slinged his Horses to the shore. Hee, not accustomed to the Seas tyranny, was layed downe on the shore, desirous by sleepe to refresh his weather-beaten head; when first a shrill noyse, disturbed with vnquiet fancies his restfull minde: but comming neerer, the horror of it quite broke off his sleepe. There was in sight, a Wood of thin, but broad spreading trees, vnder whose shade certaine darke thickets of shrubbes and bushes arise, as if on purpose to shelter treason: out of which, on the suddaine rushed a woman of good beauty, but whose eyes distayn'd with teares, and her hayre loose in manner of a funerall, made a sad and frightfull spectacle. Her Horse, though quickened with the whip, equalled not the haste of her fearefull minde; shreeking no lesse, than the mad sacrificers of women, and the extremity of her mone, tooke deepe impression in this young man, being also by nature inclinable to relieue the distressed: and hee thought it ominous, being the first spectacle that had greeted him since he landed in Sicily . But when shee was come within hearing, Whosoeuer thou art (quoth shee) if thou loue vertue, relieue Sicily , which, in the person of a valiant man, is now assaulted by wicked theeues. The mischiefe being present, will not giue me long leaue to intreat, nor can I intreat slightly for Poliarchvs : who not farre hence is vnexpectedly beset by murdering villaines. I, in the tumult escaping thence, haue light on you, as haply perchance for your glory, as his safety. And these also, (for while shee spake, her seruants came) in what manner you please to vse them, shall attend you to so good and pious an action. When shee, almost breathlesse with sighs and teares, had vttered these words, he cast his eye vpon his helme and sword, and whilest his seruants were leading his Horse towards him, hee thus replyed: Lady, I am but now landed in Sicily , and may be well excused, being a Stranger, not to haue knowne the name of shall free from danger so valiant a Gentleman as you haue spoken him. This said, he mounts his Horse, and intreats her to direct him the way: hee had onely two seruants, one being armed followed his Master, the other was left by the Sea side, for guard of the baggage, which could not be gathered vp, by reason of their suddaine departure. Now were they come to the Wood side, whose entrance with seuerall paths did so confound the womans memory, that being doubtfull which way she might search for Poliarchvs , she fills the ayre with fresh lamentations. The Stranger affrighted with such shreekes, is not resolued whether hee should make a stand, or set forwards: when suddainely the Woods sounding with cryes of men, clashing of Armes, and Horses trampling, rowzed vp his thoughts to present dangers. For three armed men came spurring with loose reines, drawne swords, and lookes eyther daring or fearing some great matter. Hee, suspecting treachery, and as in suddaine actions, men meet with dangers, they are ashamed to feare, being iealous of the womans faith, hee demands, if these were the men against whom shee desired to make vse of him. And then fastning his finger to the loope, hee directs his Iauelin (which hee could well brandish) at the faces of them, to let them know hee would not fall vnreuenged. But they addrest themselues rather to slight than fight, and by seuerall wayes hastened to escape the Conquerour. For Poliarchvs (for whom the Lady was so anxious) did alone follow the chase; and ouertaking the hindemost, hee so smote him, as thorow head and shoulders hee droue the continued wound downe to his heart. This Villaine falling, when hee more eagerly pursued the rest, the rough and furrowed ground made his Horse stumble, and gaue him a suddaine, but harmelesse fall: when streight the Lady (for she knew Poliarchvs ) lighting from her Horse, came to helpe him. But hee neyther sore with fall, nor wounds, (though hee had receyued two) still keeping his sword, leapt vp againe: and when hee had learned of Timoclea (for so was the Lady called) how shee had light vpon that Stranger, and how courteously he had promised his ayde, without delay he addresses himselfe to giue him thankes for his so great fauour. The Stranger had by this time left his Horse, and first saluting Poliarchvs , thus spake: If it had pleased the gods, valiant Sir, that I before had knowne your worth, I should haue blamed this Ladies teares, which now make mee aske pardon for offering to giue needlesse helpe to your so noble valour. I should more haue wondered at your alone putting to flight three armed men (though that were admirable) if that arme, that I now saw chastise the hindemost, had not shewed mee how iust a feare made them all flye. Poliarchvs , being himselfe most courteous, gaue him many thankes for his intended ayde, ascribing his enemies flight, not to his owne valour, but their cowardize. Thus speaking, they embrace each other; which being done, they haue now leisure to consider not onely what they speake, but to whom. For then each admires the others feature; and seemes to sticke in amazement; the one applauding those gifts in his friend, which his friend againe thinkes vnmatchable in him: Age, beauty, shape, and piercing eyes, equall yeeres, and, though in seuerall browes, the same seated Maiesty. It was a wonder to see such valour coupled with such feature. Neyther did together such a paire: and shee makes a vow, so it may stand with their liking, that shee will dedicate to the Temple of Venvs , a Table; in which the Painter shall draw both their portraitures; and though diuers accidents for a time deferred her promise; yet at length shee performed it, with these Verses vnder-written:  So Rosie are their cheekes; so faire a rise Shew their high fronts; such vigor cast their eyes: Thinke it no humane beauty: not more bright Is mounted Phoebvs , nor with such faire light Shine Larda's Sonnes; whom midd'st the waues rude strokes, The now neere-sinking Mariner inuokes. Not fayrer's Mars , when clad in Lemnian armes, Hee rides, or smiles, pleas'd with faire Venvs charmes, Threatning to none, but her poore Husband, harme. At length, when Poliarchvs had collected himselfe from viewing the Strangers face; looking merrily vpon the Lady, hee iested at her frightfull lookes, especially her loose hayre hanging about her shoulders, as if shee were going to a funerall, and asked of her merrily, If she had met with Satyres. But Timoclea with a modest smile answered; Thinke not, your danger, I fled thorow the bushes, where the thwarting bowes loosened the knots of my hayre, and thus scattered it. While they discourse, Poliarchvs his man, and two of Timoclea's seruants, which had before lost their way, hauing compast the winding of the Hill, not farre from them came out of the Wood. Timoclea's Maide was onely now wanting, whom they might perceiue a farre off, not able to guide her frighted Horse, whose stubbornenesse would neither obey her voyce, nor vselesse rodde. After they had laughed at the sight of this iest, they ranne presently to helpe the fearefull Girle. In the meane time, the Stranger asked Poliarchvs , What this treachery against him might meane? and who might be the plotter? whether it were spleene, or onely the desire of booty, that had emboldened the Rogues to this attempt? But the Lady preuented their discourse, and told them, that rest might be very welcome to them both; the one comming from Sea, the other from blowes. And my House is not farre off, quoth shee, there your entertainement shall be better, and fitter both for ease and discourse. They were easily intreated to hearken to her kinde counsel; and the man being returned, which kept the baggage at the shore, they set forward on their way. Now, the young men were almost entred euen to familiarity, and Poliarchvs answered the Stranger, first, how in the morning he came from the Kings Castle, and was bound for Agrigentum vpon businesse: how by the way he met this Lady of good note at Court, comming from the Kings daughter: how their seruants (not mindefull of their way) had lost themselues by some chance, in the turnings of the Wood: how Timoclea , and her woman onely, had kept the same path with him; when, on the crosse-way, issued forth fiue Theeues, and assaulted him with a full carreere: how the Lady, by her owne, and her Horses feare, had turned aside, and, by a happy flight, lighted vpon so courteous a Stranger. Whether by chance, or their own disorder (saith hee) I know not, their first fury had no successe against me; and with a Iauelin I slew him whom first I encountred. The fight then growing hot, one of them gaue mee a wipe with his Sword ouer the right thigh; another gaue mee a light wound in the side: whom, when being moued, I had sacrificed to my payne, and hurt another in the head, all affrighted in their vnhappy mischiefe, turned the reines; that I cannot iudge, whether more basely they attempted this villany, or cowardly left it. Then also, I followed one so close at the heeles, that your eyes were witnesses how I chastized his boldnesse; and how the fall from my horse gaue the other two leaue to escape. What these should be, I cannot suspect, vnlesse some out-riders of Lycogenes his Campe; which cyther obserued my comming, or lay in wait for any passengers.  then stand: and why Poliarchvs left the Court.  which was not farre from Pthinthia , seated by the Riuer Him aera ; on one side enuironed by the Riuer, on the other by thicke Groues, which were wreathed ouer head Arch-wise, like an Arbour. The pleasant prospect of the Riuers and Meddowes, gaue great delight to the house, which was built with Bricke on a Hill, with a stately ascent: the Wood also, and neighbouring Hills gaue grace to the situation. Her Family was great, to whom her owne chastity gaue good example: who hauing lately buried her Husband, had encreased the honour of her House by her vnspotted reputation. Shee then breakes off the discourse betweene her guests, humbly intreating them to pardon their slender entertainement. They followed her into the house; where the Ladies courtesie, and the farre spent day, inuited them to suppe and lodge. And whilest the Family prepare Supper, Poliarchvs washeth his wounds with Vineger, left they should rankle, asswaging the heat with Oyle extracted from St. Iohns- woort; beeing more confident in such knowne and easie Medicines, then relying on the faithlesse trust of Surgeons, who make their vnlawfull gaynes, by the needlesse deferring of cures. Supper being brought vp, they sate down in the Parlour; when Timoclea with well applyed language, began to question her Guest, both of his name and Countrey; and whether purposely or accidentally hee had arriued in Sicily ? He replyed, That his Countrey was Africa ; that his Parents had inioyned him to conceale his name and pedigree, and, vntill his returne, to goe by the name of Archombrotvs : and that he did not arriue in Sicily , enforced by tempest, but by his owne intended course, that hee might enioy the society of valiant men; whom fame had giuen out to liue in this Kings Court. Nothing did seeme to astonish Poliarchvs and Timoclea more, than that Africa should breed a Youth of such rare beauty: he had no great powting lips, nor little eyes sunke into his head: besides, his great desire to trauell for improuement, discouered in him a most noble disposition. But Supper being ended, he earnestly enquired of Poliarchvs , how Sicily became so pestered with robbers, and what that Lycogenes was, out of whose Campe it was suspected those Villaines came, that had set vpon him? what was the state of the Kingdome? and what the occasion of these warres? The waiters being gone (for it was bed-time, and they desired to lodge together) Poliarchvs answeres: Many vertues, O Archombrotvs , doe oftentimes grow into vices, and which is more strange, the same affections, according to the nature of the times, are sometimes vertues, sometimes vices. Meleander (of which I thinke you are not ignorant) holds this hereditary Scepter of Sicily ; a Prince of a gentle disposition; who not obseruing the rimes and dispositions of men, putteth such confidence in others, that hee thinketh by his owne goodnesse, all men to stand so affected to him: and I thinke hee hath beene sicke of too much happinesse: for in the beginning of his reigne, finding all things in peace, hee openly gaue reines to his pleasures, harmelesse Ones indeed, and familiar to many Princes, which yet did betray his easie nature, and slow to reuenge iniuries with fitting iustice. He was a little too much giuen to hunting, in whose seuerall kindes hee distinguished the seasons. Hee made friends rashly, and loued them violently: immoderate in bounty, impatient of businesse; which hee oft committed to vntrusty seruants. I would to God this might be concealed: but I had rather haue you know it by a true report, than by the iniustice of the common rumor; for the enemies presse all, and make it worse. And from this cloud did all these drops of mischiefe fall on the good King, especially by the enuy and ambition of Lycogenes , treacherously ouer-looking the Kings faults. He, proud of his princely birth, was euer impatient of a superiour: a man of a strong hand and head, and craftily courteous to the Commons: yet when time serued, exceeding all men liuing in cruelty, falshood, and pride. He easily deceiued Meleander , a Prince gentle and vertuous, vnder the Vayle of friendship: and when the King desired vacancy from businesse and Court cares, hee filled the Court with men of his owne faction, and bestowed publique Offices vpon his friends, as if they were in his owne gift, lest he should leaue any part of the Kingdome without malady. And now fury and ambition had armed Lycogenes , though not openly, against his Soueraigne: and now, though late, warre euen knocking at the gate, Predecessours, when he pleaseth, of a deepe apprehension, and one that cannot be deceiued but by his owne goodnesse, beginneth to remember why hee wore the Crowne. I can neuer enough speake what testimony he hath giuen of his wisdome and courage; since other mens vices compelled him to make vse of his owne vertue. Though now it were palpable that Lycogenes intended treason; yet hee deferred a while to execute the Law against him: thinking it sufficient if he could discouer their counsels and forces: and oftentimes he hoped by fauours to wrest submission from this vngratefull man. But him, enueighed openly against him; and much it stir'd him, that the King, hauing onely a Daughter, should settle the Crowne vpon her: Who would beleeue, at the mouth of the Riuer Alabis , a Castle, in which the Kings Daughter liued: thither Lycogenes priuily sent Russians to surprize the King, and his Daughter, while they were there lodged: but in that these treasons against himselfe and his Daughter tooke no effect, (because the villaines perished in the attempt) Meleander doth attribute his deliuery to the prouidence of minde: for first, hee commanded the Owle to be stamped in his coine, and both at sacrifices and Banquets, hee weares no other Garland then of the Oliue tree: and which was more Noble in him, he commanded his Daughter to execute the place of the chiefe Priest to that Goddesse, vntill she were wedded. Thou shalt see her, Archombrotvs , on the market dayes, girded in the Robes of her Priesthood, performing holy rites in a Chorus of Priests and virgins: yet this so great deuotion to the gods could not diuert the warre; for no suddaine, but violent, and as it were ripe rebellion followed this vnexcusable delinquencie of Lycogenes . Hee now complaines, that he is wrongfully accused of treason, and pointed out to slaughter: now giues out, that the peoples iniuries are vnsufferable, and that they haue no meanes left to curbe the insolency of such as haue ill- aduised Meleander , but by Armes; making priuate and publike discontents the pretence of his rebellion: He was powerfull in faction, and dependencies. Prouinces, were of his partie; and many by the leuity of their dispositions are made against the King; but more wonne with the dissimulation of gaue assistance to the Rebels. Vpon this, growne insolent, he challengeth the Field: and the King ready with a good Army, deferred not the battell. Fifteene dayes it is since wee fought in the plaine before Gelas : the Encounter was bloody: the Traitors no lesse labouring to maintaine their wicked designe, then we our safety: at length, night approaching, the victory enclined to the King: and Lycogenes to his now discomfited Soldiers sounds a Retreate; that instead of flight it might make shew of an orderly retire. Meleander was not willing eagerly to pursue; either content with victory to spare the blood of his owne Subiects, or that he feared ambushes, beeing in the night: and it may be he feared, seeing the chiefe about him fauoured Lycogenes , to try the vncertainety of suspected forces, to the vtter ruine of a flying Enemy: For Lycogenes had not made all his faction for open rebellion: there are many about the King of crosse and auerse natures, who, though they fight on the Kings part. fauour the Traitour. Thus was Meleander perplexed on all sides: the Counsels of his Nobility faithlesse, his secrets disclosed to the Enemy, and treasons no lesse dangerous at home then in the Campe: therefore though he obtained the Field, which now was tryed against the Enemy, yet he applyed his mind to a treaty of peace: and not confident of his victory, he remained encamped, as if the warre were yet on foote. After seuerall messages between, Embassadours from Lycogenes came to the King, in shew to obtaine buriall for the dead; but in effect to treate of agreement: which was so acceptable, that comming as petitioners, and thinking themselues feared, they durst prescribe conditions of peace to the Conqueror: but I thinke Meleander would accept of any peace: that such as flocked to so now would be respite for new inuentions, that this wicked faction might perish by their owne hands, or grow odious to the people by long continuance: or wearied with Treasons disquiet, they might turne from this disloyalty to an awfull obedience. I did not approue of this peace with insolent Traitors; and if the King should in such waighty affaires aske my aduice, (as oft he doth) I feared, beeing a young man and a Stranger, lest that and my yeeres might haue beene subiect to enuie: for I am a Stranger as you are, Archombrotvs , and nothing made me assistant to Meleander , but that his calamity was a lamentable example to all nations; who can neuer enioy firme peace, if the Subiect may checke his Princes vices, and lay snares for his vertues. Therefore, while this preiudiciall league is concluding, I chose to goe to Agrigentum , where are swords and Armes made by a Stranger of Lipara , the best that are; which I doe naturally affect.  Beacons fired in Sicily : from whence that custome did arise: Timoclea sendeth to enquire the occasion thereof.  fauouring Meleanders side, when he had inueighed against the Rebels, I pray thee, quoth hee, Poliarchvs , of what yeeres is the Kings Daughter, whom this Rebell intended to make his prey? for I haue heard in Affrica , that her name is Argenis , vnparalel'd by any for beauty, and behauiour. At these words, Poliarchvs , his eyes wandring with a gentle trembling, and his words not readily falling off, answered, that she was now twenty yeeres of age. Archombrotvs well perceiued this sudden change in therefore that he might make tryall, whether mentioning of the Princesse, or some other hidden cause, had so moued him, he offered discourse concerning enquiring more of her beauty and affections. But hee beeing no lesse daunted at this second assault, was willing to diuert his discourse. Being asked then by Archombrotvs of the friends of he, the Fates haue so abandoned Sicily , but that the King has some worthy of their honours and his fauour: amongst whom, Archombrotvs, Cleobvlvs is chiefe, a man excellent in counsell; Evrimedes also and Arsidas are famous Warriers, and no worse Statesmen. There are also two Strangers, which are Noble men of the order of Priesthood, great friends to Sicily , vseth, lest he should seeme to yeeld to shamefull conditions with disaster could euer shake: these you shall easily discerne from others, when you haue spent some time in that Court, by their worth, and carriage. It was now midnight, and both beeing sleepy, they gaue a truce to their discourse; neither had their secret cares, in that Interim of sleeping and waking, forsooke their brests: A conceit of the late heard fight was much in growing to a peace: When should he now exercise himselfe in Armes? In what Field, or what way should he approue to Meleander his courage and valour? and, smiling to himselfe, he mused why Poliarchvs , so cheerefull in all actions and fortunes, should bee so abashed at the mention of a Virgins name: for he thought, though Poliarchvs deserued well, yet neither his birth nor fortune could giue him encouragement to such a marriage. But if (quoth he) this priuate man loueth the Princesse Argenis , who will doubt but that a man for loue will forget any danger, and that louers will runne all hazzards, to take away the blemish of basenesse? Neither was Poliarchvs troubled minde lesse rackt betweene feare and hope: at length both fall asleepe; when anon the running of seruants to and fro, made a noise thorow the house; and presently some of Timoclea's people came to the Chamber dore, and told them their Lady was comming thither. In this amazement, beeing heauy in their first sleepe, they awak't, and rose,  & putting on confusedly their clothes, they met Timoclea , who when shee had excused her selfe for disquieting them being weary at that time of night; There is some great matter in hand, my guests, quoth shee, and the more fearefull, in that being night, wee know not the certainety of it: the beacons giue light vpon the top of the hils, which they durst not fire, vnlesse by the Kings command, or when the safety of the Common-wealth requireth speede in any action. This said, she leadeth them both to the toppe of the house. The house was not leaded with a steepe ridge, but flat for the pleasure of walking. The Skie was cleere, and the Moone downe, whose brightnesse oftentimes hinders other fires from beeing afarre discerned: from thence therefore, in the cleere night, they might easily discerne the fires, which on the hils tops were kindled round about: neither had they gazed there long, when from the next houses  & Towne, that was not far off: the peoples murmur in the silence of the night, came fearefully to their eares. The Strangers commanded the doores to be fast barred, lest Theeues should make vse of that tumult in the night to comit some outrage. But (quoth Timoclea ) we cannot too soone know what this businesse is, so publikely notified and diuulged: the Towne Pthinthia was neere, whither, if they so pleased, she would send one of her seruants to vnderstand the truth. They approuing her counsell, went downe to the dores, and sent forth a seruant with expresse command, to discouer the occasion of this vprore, and relate it vnto them. In the meane time, beeing doubtfull, they came downe into the dining- roome, and stirring vp the fire, placing the Lady between them, they asked of her, what custome this was in Sicily , and what benefit they found by it? for, quoth Poliarchvs , I haue now liued a yeere in Sicily , and these are the first that I haue seene. But, said Timoclea , haue you not seene on the toppe of euery high hill, a tree fastned in the ground, of the length of a Ship mast, whose top being hollowed, is bound about with hoopes of iron? Yes, quoth Poliarchvs . Know then, quoth shee, these are the publike trees ordained for that vse, which being kindled by the Kings command, giue notice to the people to be suddenly ready vpon all occasions: and these they call Beacons. They which first espy them, doe presently giue fire to the Beacons vpon the next hils, by which meanes more remote dwellers are warned, vntill the light, with a wonderfull swiftnesse, haue ouer-runne the whole Iland. The people in the meane time are in Armes, ready for any seruice that shall be appointed them: when presently the King sendeth a Poast into the next City, to make Proclamation of his Royall pleasure. From thence the Citizens poast vpon fresh horses vnto the next Townes, from whom the King requireth the like faithfull speede. So, euery man being faithfull in his office, the whole Iland is raised in an instant at the Kings becke. Neither doe wee fire them without especiall cause. Once before I saw them kindled, when scarch was made for Traitors that assaulted the King: God grant they are not now fired vpon some sad occasion, or mischiefe already done. As yet Poliarchvs did not allow of her reason; and smiling, said, I did expect, Lady, that you would haue brought this custome from the ancient religion of the lights, which Ceres , hauing lost her daughter, raised out of the vapours of your Mountaine Æ tna . But wherein doth this sudden tumult auaile the Common-wealth? or why should not the King effect businesse in the day by his Officers, as well as in the troublesome night? She replyes; This institution, Poliarchvs , is not altogether without his vse; especially when the arriuall of some Enemy is feared vpon the coast: for the Captaines of the Ports, warned by this fire, barre vp their Hauens, and make ready their Gallies, if need be, to fight at Sea: and also the people vnder their Captaines and Leaders, must not remoue from their Colours; so that if the Enemy misse them at Sea, he shall not find them vnprepared at Land. There is also another vse of these publike fires: If any offender, whom the Law doth lay hold on, labour to fly out of Sicily , or conceale himselfe in the Countrey, by his friends, or the Mountaines helpe: for after the Beacons are kindled it is Treason for any man to weigh anchor from the Ports: and whosoeuer shall receiue into his house the malefactor, the Law iudgeth him guilty of the same crime and punishment. From these speeches of Timoclea , they turned to other discourse, questioning among themselues, what they might coniecture the occasion of this tumult. Poliarchvs feared the worst: Lycogenes was not to bee trusted, and Meleander too open to Treason, both by his seruants disloyalty, and his owne great spirit, scorning euen iust feares. Whilest they thus discourse among themselues the mischiefes of a Ciuill warre, Timoclea deliuers her Guests these Verses, which Nicopompvs , a man eminent for learning  & the Kings fauour, had maide against Lycogenes , liberally inueighing against him, for ambitiously affecting the Kings Crowne, and his Daughters marriage.  What Plague infests the earth? oh worldly States! Oh Crownes! oh heauen-borne power of Potentates! What Fury should the people so prouoke, That, to put on a Tyrants slauish yoke, They should forsake the iust Authority Of their true Lords? Faith, troth, and loyalty Are dead: no power can their blind fury awe. So when proud Earth, from her swolne bowels, saw Her Giant brood, and shew'd them Heauen from farre, Vndaunted, they straight vndertake the warre, And hope to heauen by pyl'd vp hils to come, Till that againe in their proud mothers wombe, But thou, this Kingdomes ominous portent, Like the new-horn'd Cerastes , violent, The Lands disturber, treacherously mis-led, The Fathers Crowne, the Daughters happy bed In vaine hast sought, and shalt, for thy disgrace, How wilt thou suffer, wretch? how, after death, Stand trembling at th'infernall Tyrants breath? Either thy limbes, fast bound toth' racking wheele, Or liuer shall the tyring Vulture feele: Or else thy bulke, strooke by the Thunderer, Ætna the graue of Monsters shall enterre, Where flames, Enceladvs , still breathing, yeelds. Well fed, and safely kept those heards of thine; You, Hercvles, Ceres , and Ericine ; You natiue gods, and forraigne deities, To whom Sicilians chastely sacrifice; Strengthen the good: protect Kings power, that they May safely honours to your Altars pay.  and that the Beacons were fired to take him.  Seruant was returned: they all flocked about him with longing thoughts, as desirous to bee put out of doubt, yet fearefull to aske the question: and the man thinking it vnfit to tell his message before the Strangers, called the Lady aside;  & deliuering his newes, the Lady was dismayed, and himselfe trembled. Then Timoclea , being a woman of a strong sudden wit, taking him by the hand, that he might not speake with his fellowes, withdrew him into the next chamber: and entreating her Guests to follow, she fearefully shuts the doore, and commands her Seruant to relate what he had heard. Then, quoth he, I was scarce entred into the Towne, when many met me, scarce knowing themselues whither they went, as it oft fals out in such tumults; at euery doore they hanged out Lanthornes, and gathering together into rings, they stood like people without life or soule. When I drew neere to the first company, I heard that Poliarchvs was attainted of treason, and searcht for, to suffer the Lawes punishment; and for that cause the Beacons were set on fire. I, thinking they might mistake the name (which is easie among the multitude) enquired curiously, what Poliarchvs , and for what offence? They all agreed, it was that Poliarchvs the Stranger, that had liued a yeere in Sicily , famous for Armes and the Kings fauour. They all were ignorant wherein he had offended: but by the King he was condemned, and narrowly searcht for. I passing to the next company, finde them all in one tale; and perceiuing no vncertainety in the report, I made haste to bring you this sure relation. At report heereof Archombrotvs and Timoclea fixed their eyes vpon of the danger, his courage not brooking this reproach, asked againe of the Seruant, if it were true? and of Timoclea , if her man were mad? himselfe walking vp and downe like a man in a dreame: holding his peace a while, lest in so great a conflict of his thoughts, he might let fall words vnworthily against fortune or the King. But a businesse of such waight, and doubt whether the house were trusty or not, would admit no delay. Then lifting vp his hands and eyes to heauen; You gods of Sicily , qouth hee, and powers diuine, that protect honesty and iustice: you, Meleanders guarding angels and houshold gods, I call all to witnesse, desiring, if euer by hand, counsell, or any way, I haue wronged the King or Common-wealth of Sicily ; if I haue violated the Lawes of Hospitality, or haue deserued to bee branded with this marke of suspected Treason; let me dye a cruell death, in the scorne of all my enemies. But if I haue bent all my endeuours for the Kingdomes safety, and all this misery doth faultlesse fall vpon mee; grant,  o yee gods, that prouing my innocencie to the King and people, I may with safety depart the Kingdome, and not leaue behind me a base and ignoble memory. But I will not make you, Lady, a sharer in my danger: about midnight will I steale into the Fields, and free your house from the infection of my miseries. In the meane time that he promised his vtmost ayde to Poliarchvs . By their countenance, violence, and garbe of speech, you could not perceiue whose the danger was; but that Archombrotvs seemed the most angry. But the Lady seeming incredulous of her Seruants report, promised to send againe to heare more certainely: but she willeth her man to stay in the Parlour; and leadeth her Guests into a priuate roome, to aduise with them.  her house, vnder colour of taking leaue, and descendeth into the Vault.  shee was fully assured of the Kings anger: because shee had sent a wise seruant, and one that would relate nothing but the truth. She offered her house, and all her helpe to Poliarchvs , how it please him to vse it for his safety: but alas, quoth shee, what can this house or thine ayde, the house eyther open will betray vs, or pulled downe will ouer-whelme vs. Neither can we hope that all the houshold should be faithfull, and none discouer thee, if thou long abide here. Know yee what is come into my minde to preuent this suddaine danger? The first builders of this house vaulted vnder the ground a secret way vnknowne to any at this day but my selfe: which diuided into three wayes, hath as many clap-doores opening into seuerall fields. There, Poliarchvs , may you easily lye concealed, and free from danger. Pretend onely to take your leaue of mee, as affrighted with this fearefull rumour; so shall we both be free from danger, and neyther thou as an offender, nor I as an harbourer, suffer in this tumult. As soone as you are out of the doore, a thicke row of Trees, which leade from thence to the Riuer Him aera , will bring you where the mouth of the caue is, not farre from the brinke of the Riuer: and I my selfe, without the priuity of any seruant, with a Torch in my hand, will passe thorow the Vault to that end by the Riuer: where when we haue you once, by the helpe of the gods wee shall preserue you, till this storme be blowne ouer. It is fit a disposition should proue false; but it much concernes you to conceale it from your seruant, lest by continuance of feare, or hope of reward, hee should proue false. follow her counsell for that night, willing to stay in this Vault, only till he might learne what Deuils had thus stirred Sicily against him. He could not be perswaded to conceale this secret from his seruant, whom hee knew to bee most faithfull; and whose seruice might at this time be much auaileable. Neither would he intreat Archombrotvs to be silent, thinking himselfe worthy of a greater calamity, if he should offer to doubt his fidelity. Vpon these words, they goe out of the Parlour, and the admired Poliarchvs compleatly armed, as if hee went to fight, issues out of Timoclea's doores. Then briefly he told the amazed seruants, who were enquiring the cause of this suddaine change, that those Beacons were kindled in search of him: and that he therefore fled, lest of necessity hee should be discouered by them, or they suffer with him. And then taking his leaue, as for a longer iourney, of Archombrotvs and Timoclea , he leapt vpon his Horse, and his seruant following him, came to the place appoynted by the Lady. The strangenes and almost shame of the danger, vexed the young Poliarchvs : O mad man that I was, quoth hee, Gelanorvs , (for so was his seruant called) to put this life into any mans power! What needed I to trauell into this Countrey vnknowne, and in a habit not befitting my ranke? What else doth the Fable intimate of Lycaons intent to murder Ivpiter as then his Guest; than that Princes come to vntimely ends, by trusting themselues to strangers; not more by their villany, than their owne simplicity? I haue layd my selfe open to iniury: tis well: and doe deseruedly suffer, Gelanorvs . Whilest hee speakes thus, hee calls to minde the occasion that brought him into Sicily : and moued with the sacred remembrance thereof, hee feared lest he had offended in grieuing for this danger, in hope of that happinesse that made him liue here. Gelanorvs , being troubled with a faithfull feare of his Masters danger, aduised him to vnmaske his birth and condition, without further dissimulation. For, if he should take off the vizard, and assume his owne greatnesse, Meleander would willingly excuse his hard Sentence, and his enemies aske pardon. Thou art deceyued (quoth Poliarchvs :) tis much better to conceale my selfe, after this iniury receyued: for the knowledge of my greatnesse, would moue them to thinke, after this wrong, I could be but once released, but neuer forget the iniury. Gelanorvs answered nothing: vncertaine as yet what to doe, he inuokes all the Starres that shined that silent night, to the ayde of his Master and himselfe. In the meane time, Timoclea , barring vp her doores, commanded her seruants to bed, vnwilling to haue any trouble in the night, and the next morning purposing to learne the whole truth of the businesse. Then goes shee about to euery ones Chamber, as intentiue to her houshold cares, but indeed that none should pry into a businesse of that secrecy. When all were at rest, and husht, she entreth into a little Chamber with Archombrotvs , in which the cunning worke-man had made the secret passage into the Vault. The Chamber was boorded, and close nayled together; onely there were two plankes artificially clozed, but left vnnayled, that they might easily be taken vp. Ouer these stood a long Table, to preuent treading vpon them; lest being loose, they should at any time be moued, and so disclose the secret. seldome. Then, taking vp the boords, shee opened the mouth of the Vault; then, striking fire from a Flint, shee lighted her Torch, and so leades the way: were twenty steps, by which they descended into the Vault, which reaching forward, diuided it selfe into seuerall passages, lest one of the Caues mouthes being beset, all hope of escape should be taken away. The ground was fit for this worke, because it was so firme, that where you did digge, none would fall after the Mattocke: Neyther was it hard to sinke, there beeing no stones to hinder the Pioner, or yeelding sand to frustrate his labour. This long arched Vault, though it bore the burthen of the house and fields, was nothing ruined by time. In the entrance, a little way was playstered, that it might be adorned with Letters and Pictures. But the dampe ayre, not quickened by the Starres influence, had somewhat blemished the Imagery: yet there was to be seene the Portraiture of an Altar, and a man putting his counterfeit Frankincense into the fire: ouer which these Verses were to be, though hardly, read:  You gods, that here below, your worship haue; Be this Ioves Palace, or grim Plvto's Caue, Or hee that does in his blue armes enfold Earth's Globe, doc here his three-forkt Scepter hold: This Vault still faithfull to the Lords maintaine: No treachery, no theft this darkenesse slaine. Be hence Enyoes sad amazing light: No horrid shapes, nor hideous noyse affright. Let rest and peacefull silence still appeare, Whilest this chaste Family burne Incense here. All guilty soules let hellish horror fright, But good men heere enioy a quiet night. withdrew his eyes from the obseruation of the place.  A pleasing discourse betweene Archombrotvs and Timoclea , of Court Minions, and Kings Fauourites.  affectionately beloued of the King than Poliarchvs , though a Stranger, and without the enuy of good men: but, I know not, quoth shee, how the Fates haue frowned vpon those that are neerest and dearest to our Princes. Tis true, replyed Archombrotvs : What Courts haue not felt the influence of the late appearing Comet? Then, quoth Timoclea , know, Archombrotvs , the cause of the ruine of all the rest, was in themselues or their Masters; but what calamity should afflict a man of so much vertue vnder so iust a King? Doest thou make the Lydian marryed couple a president, who lately payed the score of their faint happinesse in a forreine Countrey; hee being at the height of honour, weltred in his bloud; shee brought vpon the scaffold to offer her tender necke to the Headsmans Axe? I speake, Archombrotvs , a thing generally knowne; but what in that passage is like to Poliarchvs ? They wanted nothing to Soueraignty, but the name and title. They scorned to be ranked with their owne kindred; neyther had they desert to soare with so lofty a plume: and being blinded, they set light by his youth, who could haue made good all their fortunes, and at length ruined them to expresse his power. But himselfe by Castles and Forts: and his vertue shined like the light of the Sunne in this Sphere of Sicily : but those Lydians were farre otherwise; and so were the Phrygian couple, being such another mocking-stocke of Fortune. What, those, quoth from the Kings elbow, where they had beene most powerfull! but the King mindefull of his former affection, saued their liues, though condemned to perpetuall prison. So it is, quoth Timoclea ; you know therefore how much they offended; hee, as vnmindefull of his first state, and scorning to seeke the peoples loue: shee, not ashamed of the diuorce from her first Husband: both of them neglecting their seruice to the angry Queene, thinking goddesses not armed with thunder to reuenge. We should wonder at these things, Timoclea , quoth Archombrotvs , did not the frequency of such games of Fortune banish amazement. Looke vpon the seuerall Courts of Aqvilivs , and Hippophilvs ; what hath it booted the greatest Peeres, when they haue runne their high and powerfull course, to betake themselues to the Priesthood, as to a Sanctuary? onely that their dying honour might haue a more precious Funerall. But you will leaue no power to Princes, vnlesse they may change friends, for that priuiledge we grant to priuate men. Nay, quoth Timoclea , in such waynes of Fortune, you will scarce cleare Kings, nor their falling Fauourites: for these Kings (if we may speake the truth) that haue alwayes some too powerfull with them, are often taken with a delight to change their Minions. They bestow their loue rashly, and take it away with loathing; refreshing with new friends, their mindes growne sicke of the old. Many of them, like men in a Feuer, whose hot fit turnes to extreme cold, make hatred the end of their loues; their disordered affections, making them eyther slaues or tyrants. Some, more temperate, are content to take new, not ruining the former,  & so fill their Courts with faction, brabbles, and emulation. They loue indeed longest, but in the end neyther safest nor truest, who knowing themselues vnfit for businesse, and the burden of cares, preferre some selected man to their most weighty affaires, putting not onely their States, but themselues into his hands, oftentimes to their owne ruine; because they had no more power to chuse a Gouernour, than to gouerne themselues: and now they doe not loue this man, but feare him, suspect him, and stand in awe of his checke: vntill hee, forgetting that he ruleth by sufferance, begins to grow insolent, or else the King by the same errour of iudgement, not knowing freedome, begins to doat vpon another. Surely you will smile, worthy Guest, to heare a Woman reason of these things; but our generall miseries haue made this argument so common, that almost each woman hath an apprehension of it. I confesse, quoth Archombrotvs , (being a well-wisher to Princes) Kings may often erre in suppressing Fauourites; and Fauourites too, hastning, by their owne faults, Fortunes departure: who would stay longer, if they were wiser. Some of them, not well considering their Masters dispositions, neglect to cherish the cause that first brought them in fauour: or else they surfet the yet weake and raw appetite of their Soueraigne, with too-much vsing their fauours, he being like an vnprepared stomacke, not able to digest their importunities. Others are lost by their insatiable desires; who, though they swimme in all abundance, finding their Prince inclining to fauour another, doe as it were tye his hands, as if his promise had bound him perpetually to their loue. So they that might goe off from such imployment to a glorious retyrement, had rather bee disgracefully driuen, than goe quietly. What madnesse causes it, when such fortune falls vpon light dispositions? You know how Phaeton vsed his Chariot, and Icarvs his wings: neyther doe we blame Iove nor Phoebvs for their ruine. But, quoth Timoclea , howsoeuer they may stand or fall, and be reduced to their former conditions; rather see what befalls Kings out of this Cloud of prodigall loue, whose safetie or ruine concernes the whole State. For, being brought vp at Court, I haue often heard from the mouth of wisdome, that a Prince of worth, and a man able to beare his honour, should fauour no one man so much, as to discend himselfe into parties and factions: for, when they are raysed to an eminent height by the Kings bounty, are subiect to enuy for their too-great power, and so protected by their Soueraigne, that they cannot be wounded but thorow his side, the disorder is the greater; the King is taxed; and in another name so much the more disgraced, by how much they which dare doe this, thinke him patient of iniuries, by the weakenesse of his doting loue. But wee see nothing more lamentable in the contemplation of humane blindenesse, than when Kings think to gaine loue by great gifts; whereas rather their indiscreet bounty extinguishes that true loue that was before in them, if there were any whom they so preferre: for, as long as Kings Fauourites haue a feeling of happy fortune, but moderate, and like weake Iuy, want a Tree to support them, so long they pray for the Kings health; eyther because they depend vpon him, or because they can hope for no benefit by his fall. But, after they are growne to a bigger bulke, they relye on their owne greatnesse, and vntwine their Branches from off that Tree, by whose supportation they came to that high growth, that they may stand, though the Tree fall. They make haste to diuide their fortunes from the Princes dependency, and bestow that loue onely on themselues, which they owe to him. For they know, the King, being with-drawne from the violence of his affections, may repent his errours, and grow fearefull of that power which himselfe hath raysed. And it is commonly fatall, that when a King hath raysed any to that height, one of them must fall. Now therefore they begin to be circumspect of their owne safety, and by cunning slights to auoid the suspicion of future emulation; wresting all businesse, not to the honour and profit of the King; but to giue their owne security sure footing against fortune, and their now betrayed Masters. But that there is sometimes a vertue, which that felicity cannot corrupt, Poliarchvs is the example, who neyther hath forsaken his loyalty, nor growne insolent in his great fortune: so that in this his danger, I can finde nothing but the Fates to be blamed.  Caue. Poliarchvs his horse set at liberty, by which deuice, Gelanorvs feigneth his Masters death.  at the in-side held the stone from going out, so fastened in the ground, that, by no force from without, they could be shaken; but they that were within the caue, turning them aside, might easily lift them out of those little trenches, which so supported them, lest the weight of the doore might make them slide away. Hauing drawne the barres, and rolled the stone aside, Archombrotvs opened the Caue, and Timoclea stepping out, wasted the Torch with her hand, as she had agreed with Poliarchvs , and presently extinguished the light, lest by stay shee might giue notice to some vnwelcome guests. Hee, hauing found his way, stood at the Riuer, expecting the signe; which giuen, hee drawes neere the Lady: but doubted how to dispose of his mans horse, and his owne; vntill Gelanorvs answered, Goe and aduise in the Caue; and while you determine about the horses, they shall stand tyed to yonder Alder-trees, which grow by the banke, remote from any high-way. Whilest they descend, and as yet fearefull, conclude of nothing, Gelanorvs , hauing tyed vp his horses, was come to them. Where, when they had receyued him, they put the stone to the Caues mouth againe, and fasten it with the barres, betaking themselues to counsell. Poliarchvs thought it best to send his seruant abroad for discouery, to heare what crime was layde to his charge, what suddaine cruelty had possest the King, and whether his friends did sticke to him in this aduersity? You say well, Poliarchvs , (quoth him, where you did conceale your selfe. I doubt not his fidelity, but if hee light vpon enemies, perhaps they would wrest the truth from him by torture. nor torture should force any thing from him: and that he had a deuice to delude his enemies: he would goe like one amazed; and, if any vnknowne or suspected person enquired of Poliarchvs , with a countenance fitting his griefe, he would tell them, Poliarchvs had left this light: neyther is this tale vntrue; beeing hid in a Caue where hee sees no Sunne: If they inquired what kinde of death, hee would frame this lye, That his Master had falne from his Horse into the Riuer Hym aera ; for flying affrighted at the Kings Edict, entring by night the Riuer, and missing the passage, heauy with his Armour, and losing his Horses backe, hee was swallowed vp. (And then fitly for this purpose, it happened that Hym aera was high swolne.) I will say farther, that there was no helpe in mee, when I saw my Master by the strong torrent carryed into the Sea. by this fiction the report of your death shall bee spred abroad, then which nothing will bee more commodious for our businesse. For it will glut your enemies, and draw pitty from other men; who alwayes loue to speake most gloriously of deceased vertue. The watch also shall bee broken vp, which guard the Ports and Sea-townes: and the search for you beeing stayed; you may with greater ease lye concealed, or flye. Neither can we faine any safer kinde of death, then this that leaues nothing of you: and then will I let your horse runne at randome, as if his Masters death had giuen him this liberty. This inuention of Gelanorvs pleased the all: but Poliarchvs told him, if hee should meete with Arsidas , of whom he had most confidence among the Sicilians , he should not sticke to tell the truth, and entreat him in his name, not to feare to visite one so wrongfully opprest: or if he could not, he should leaue to his trust what were best to be done. Archombrotvs also aduised Gelanorvs , that hauing done his businesse, he should not presently returne to the Caue (for neither could they well heare him knocke, and it might make the place suspicious, if any body should passe that way) but comming to Timoclea's house, he should vse the same dissimulation to her seruants, wherewith he had deceiued others; and lament his masters fate, with as much sorrow as he could expresse: and so secretly, by Timoclea's helpe, be brought to Poliarchvs . They consulted further, how to dispose of Poliarchvs his house and family: for hee had furnisht a house not vnbeseeming a man neere the King: neither had hee any confidence in his houshold seruants; for he had but onely this him: neither tooke hee much care for his goods; as vsing to carry about him Iewels of exceeding valew, and some gold in a priuate pocket, not knowing to what extremity he might be driuen. Whether therefore Meleander should confiscate them as the goods of a condemned man, or his seruants and hirelings purloine them away; he should say nothing, but withdraw himselfe, as from the ruines of a falling house. With these instructions they sent him away: neither could Archombrotvs or Timoclea make any long stay with Poliarchvs ; fearing the suspition of the seruants, rising to their morning attendance, who (as fortune commonly will haue it) are then most diligent, when you least desire it: for these to finde out their Ladies care of Poliarchvs , might prooue both their ruines. They entreate him therefore to make vertue his companion; which can neither deserue affliction, nor be daunted with it vniustly happening. They promise him their company and discourse at all fitting opportunities. Timoclea then shews him a couch to lye on, and deliuers him lights (for she had brought many in) which done, they both returne to their owne chambers. How Poliarchvs minde was now troubled, and how farre he gaue himselfe ouer to anger and complaints, being alone, you may heere vnderstand, that he did not more thinke vpon life, than a noble way of dying: and he knew that some, whom hee esteemed aboue himselfe, depended vpon his safety.  What they were whom Poliarchvs slew. Gelanorvs maketh Timonides beleeue that his Master is drowned: but reuealeth the whole truth to  know himselfe masterles by the stroke of a Rod, he mounts his own,  & sets on his appointed way: and forward beeing almost come to the wood, where carried, and men on horsebacke attending them, after whom followed a troupe of foote. Hee much desired to know what this solemnity might bee: and comming neerer, he perceiued the Litters were for a Funerall, and the men mourners. Affrighted with this tragicke Omen ; he demanded of one of the hindmost, whose Funerals those should be? Hee answered, that they were going to the bodies of the Embassadours, whom Poliarchvs the day before, against the Law of Nations, had slaine. Gelanorvs was astonished, and to himselfe admiring what Funerall, or rather what fraud this might bee; and desirous to knowe the certainety, he ioyned himselfe to the troupe, vntill he perceiued the dead body of him whom Poliarchvs had slaine, lying at the wood side, to be taken vp into one of the mourning Litters. Then plainly appeared it, that those Tneeues that had light on Poliarchvs , were Lycogenes his Embassadours Meleander . But why should the reuenge bee so suddaine? Why should not Poliarchvs haue a day of hearing? Shall then Embassadours haue a priuiledge to be Theeues? Or should the King be more fauourable to his enemies then to his friends? The reward of his valour should haue bin giuen to the Conqueror; and a Gibbet, in stead of honourable Funerall, to Embassadours perishing in their owne villany. While he was pondering these things in a confused and zealous duety to his Master, his Choler did so abound, that hardly could hee containe either his tongue or countenance. Hee thought it best to forsake that spectacle that did so much offend him. Cursing therefore those enemies, he tooke his neerest way to the Court: being come to the other side of the wood, about noone, he met many in the way: for that way was much frequented by souldiers, by reason of the neerenesse of the Campe Royall. Among others, he met Timonides , a man of no small note in the Kings Houshold. Hee, carefull for Poliarchvs , was to that purpose come abroad to learne what had befalne him. And therefore, knowing Gelanorvs ; Oh happily met! quoth hee, tell me where, in this great tumult, is Poliarchvs ? Hee, remembring what face hee was to put on, scarce lifting vp his eyes to Timonides , told him hee was dead. But then loue and piety in Timonides , ouercame all politique feare: and standing like one in a diuining fury, with sighes he broke into these words: Oh vnhappy afforded no small comfort to Gelanorvs , that his Masters faigned death should finde such true and open lamentation. Timonides had not rode farre, but he returnes againe: And what, quoth he, Gelanorvs , was the manner of that Worthies death? by what accident, or by whom was he slaine? Affrighted with the Kings Proclamation (answered Gelanorvs ) he ventured by darke to find the foord of the Riuer Him aera : but the Riuer swelling with late raine, was too rough for him; and, as farre as I by starre-light could coniecture, rowled him into the adioyning Sea. Timonides againe fell into passion; and full of this heauy newes, returneth straight toward the Court. Not farre off he met Arsidas , to whom alone Poliarchvs commanded Gelanorvs to reueale this secret: whom presently Timonides filleth with the horrour of this mournfull newes. himselfe, as before hee intended, went toward the Court. Arsidas going to him that hee brought a secret, for which this publike place wes not so fit: if it pleased him to walke aside, hee, when none obserued, would follow after. farre off a solitary valley; whither when they were both met, Gelanorvs thus began: Poliarchvs, o Arsidas , is aliue; but he desires you onely should be priuy to it. A Vault there is vnder Timoclea's house, where by the trusty Lady hee is conceal'd: but he sent mee to you, to learne what wind had stirr'd this tempest against him: and, if you disdaine not a man in affliction, hee desires your company. Arsidas told him, he feared no danger in that behalfe: desiring onely Gelanorvs to lead him to the Caue, and shew him his wisht for Poliarchvs . Nay, quoth Gelanorvs , we must vse some plot to deceiue Timoclea's Family, lest they should vnderstand vnder the girdle of base Peasants. I will goe first, and forcning teares, as I did with Timonides , will lament his faigned death: and you, Arsidas , whomsoeuer you meete, may to good purpose so delude. His life will bee more secure, beeing thought dead. You, at noone, may come to Timoclea's house, as to refresh you from the heate of the day: neither can it be suspicious for you to turne into the house of a Lady so well and long knowne to you. I must tell you one thing besides: There is a young man that came but yesterday into Sicily : vnlesse he dissemble, he comes from Affrica : you will admire his presence, and (when you heare him speake) his wisdome. His loue to firmely in this great extremity. His carriage, neither from you nor my Master, can deserue the least suspition. These things so appointed, they take seuerall wayes: Gelanorvs coasteth the readiest way to Timoclea's house; but , being deceiued, spreads abroad this tragicall newes: for to whomsoeuer hee met of his acquaintance, he presently relates Poliarchvs his death. The report then began to spread farre, and was receiued, according to the conditions of men, with seuerall affections, but in all extreme. Meleander had that day determined, crossing the Riuer Hypsa , to goe to Magella ; whither, by his appointment, his Daughter Argenis was returned from Syracusa . And now, the iourney appointed, the Guard make ready; and the King, till the time of going called him, walked in a neere-adioyning valley. The King was amongst his Nobles, not doubting but that many, who attended him vnder the colour of loue and duety, were his enemies; when lo, Timonides returnes into the Tent, telling his friends what he had heard of the death of Poliarchvs . This direfull report passeth speedily through the whole Campe; and was easily beleeued. and thus speake: There is great cause, Sir, that we should thanke Lycogenes: Poliarchvs is dead. At which words, the King, distracted with variable thoughts, stood in a maze: the losse and death of this braue Young man did the more sting him, by reason that the cause would seeme to haue from him the originall: and now teares beganne to fall from him, as a mournfull presage of ill fortune: but hee thought it not then safe to lament publikely, since many of Lycogenes his friends had their eyes vpon him, to obserue each looke, word, and gesture. With a settled countenance therefore, bewraying neither griefe nor ioy, he demanded somewhat of his death, and returned into his Tent; certainely assured that none reioyced at Poliarchvs death, but those which desired his owne ruine. The Kings presence hindred many of the Soldiers from present lamentation. The faithfullest Nobles, not able to containe their sighes, bewailed his death: or else with greater anger in their ordinary discourses, complained of the Fates, and the times iniury. Those, the King with a carefull remembrance distinguished from the rest, as only deseruing his trust: neither did hee behold them without blushing, fearing their thoughts of him as the murderer of Poliarchvs . It was a strange thing, that one shouid be so bold, out of a sudden heate, to make these Verses, and lay them in the entry of the Tent, where the King must needes passe.  Mirour of men! If Stygian Fiends, that fright Others, stand trembling at thy dreadfull sight: Or if with one starre more thou fill the Sky, Not deigning now to shine on Sicily : Oh, pardon vs; doe not thou vengefull bee With other gods: we shall become, for thee, The scorne of Nations and posterity. Could then the fire or water be thy fate? What water, (gods!) what fire shall expiate Our foule offence? Water, for this blacke deed, And fire, themselues an expiation need.  The report of Poliarchvs death comes to Argenis eares: her lamentation: Selenissa hinders her attempting of killing her selfe.  the people, had noysed the death of Poliarchvs , and brought it to Magella . Argenis by chance was then sitting in her Bed-chamber, dressing her selfe amongst her Maids; though not so as in better times, yet fitting her Princely state. Selenissa was Nurse to Argenis , and priuy to all her secrets; and was then binding vp her haire, when one of the Maids passing thorow the Court-yard, returnes with report of Poliarchvs death. The newes entered not first the eares of Argenis , being in an earnest discourse with Selenissa , about the firing of the Beacons, and filled her mind with great astonishment; and secretly becking and winking on the Maids, she bade them speake softlier. But their whispering had filled the Chamber: and Argenis , astonished with sudden feare, enquired what ill newes they muttered among themselues: for as yet she knew not what the Maid had said. Selenissa preuents their answere, telling Argenis , that a Glasse which the King her Father had giuen her vpon her birth-day, had by misfortune falne out of one of her Maids hands; and that feare of their Ladies anger made that whispering. But Argenis , now apt to feare, could not bee so satisfied: leaping therefore from her seate, and catching her next Maid by the hand, viewing her with sparkling eyes; If now, quoth shee, thou dare lye to mee, know, thou shalt neuer againe looke mee in the face. Tell me therefore truely, if you haue heard any ill newes of the King. She, to expell farre that feare of Meleander , and willing to giue her comfort; No, Madam, quoth shee; well heare all wee of the King, beeing in health, and a Conquerour: but a small misfortune hath seasoned this felicity; Poliarchvs is dead. fainting spirits, at one instant determining and deferring death. And because shee would not giue her Maids occasion of suspecting any thing; I doubt not, quoth shee, but the gods take care of the King, who will giue a iust end to these broyles. She feared to speake of Poliarchvs , lest shee should faulter in his very name, beeing almost vanquisht with her now collected griefe. And when she could no longer dissemble her sorrow, she runnes hastily into her priuate Closet, as vpon some sudden businesse; and then bolts the doore, that none should preuent her to breathe her last. But that fury deceiued not Selenissa ; who following neere the steps of Argenis , (that was lawfull for her Nurse) she held with her hand the shutting doore, and vnder colour of seruice, followed her Ladies priuacy. Then at length, Argenis free to her griefe, when the doore was bolted, melts into teares; and rending her haire, shee throwes her scattered attire on the ground: a low Couch shee had of Iuory, couered with purple for her repose in the day time: on which, with all her weight, she throwes her selfe. Neyther did Selenissa speake at all, but in silence stayd till her first flux of teares might end of their owne accord; but, as soone as shee perceyued her griefe with quieter expressions, and with vexation holding vp her wringed hands and eyes to heauen; and speaking fearefully to her selfe, her eyes wandring, and holding a long steele instrument, that was sharpned for diuers vses, to her throat, she leaped to her in this agony: and holding her arme, that was now almost her Executioner, in her trembling hands, shee laboured to giue deserued reproofe to her Ladies fury; for griefe had stopped her thickest sighs. Long did the wofull couple striue in this sort, being both now so weake; the one not able to vse the knife, nor the other to wrest it from her; both resolute, and fixing their eyes each on other. Argenis especially casting her necke on her shoulder, with a breathlesse carelesnesse viewing thy hindrance I can dye. Hitherto thou hast well taught me to be constant, thankefull, and religious. Why doest thou now change those precepts to a new religion? it shall be both to my selfe and thee a comfort, that I goe to my graue with vnspotted chastity. Thinkest thou I can out-liue Poliarchvs ? hee deliuered mee from Lycogenes his rape; and I will deliuer him my life, which is lesse than my chastity which hee preserued, or the reward which he deserued. I, Selenissa , (if thou knowest it not) kill'd Poliarchvs : I cannot expiate that offence, vnlesse in mine owne bloud. What had he to doe in Sicily , but for Argenis sake? Ouerwhelmed with griefe in this discourse, shee faynted; the knife falls out of her hand, and shee on But now she was not onely carefull for Argenis sake, but for her owne, applying all possible remedy to her that scarce heard her, sometimes bewayling eythers condition, and verily beleeuing that those griefes would suddenly vanish, if they were let fully loose: sometimes againe viewing onely her nurse-childes griefe: sometimes shee puts her in minde of her father; whom her death must needes kill, already broken with publique rebellions. She tells her that she is as her fathers purple and fatall locke: which if she should pluck, as Scylla did for the loue of Minos , with a double parricide shee would ruine both her selfe and her father: or, could shee thinke that the common opinion, which of it selfe is ill inclinable, could be easily perswaded, that chastity could out-liue a loue so violent? but this she spake to deafe eares. Then, seeing Argenis obstinate, she growes rough her selfe, and tells her, shee will not see it, and vnlesse shee would promise to liue, shee would call for helpe; and with that, seemed to goe to the doore; when Argenis , laying hold on the skirt of her garment, pulling her backe to embrace her; O Mother (quoth she) why doe you let mee from enioying so true a sorrow? Doe you thinke Poliarchvs would haue out-liued mee, if I had dyed? Thou doest not deceiue mee, O Selenissa : I haue from my infancy vnderstood what did belong to my yeeres, what thou diddest command mee, and commend to mee: and what thou dost now forbid mee to doe, being once by mine owne hand done, thou thy selfe wilt chiefly commend: if ought remaine of the dead, Poliarchvs yet loues mee. I will goe happily to my Spouse, and without enuy enioy his chaste imbraces. But if wee dye all together, no soule remayning, yet with my life I shall escape this mischiefe, I shall not (I dread to speake it) reuerence the Murderer of my Poliarchvs . Thou knowest by whose command the Beacons yesterday were fired; and doubt you that from thence came his destruction? But hee is my father, and 'twere impietie in mee to hate him. So, betweene Poliarchvs and my father, I will diuide my loue, and laying downe my life, which I haue receyued from both their hands, I will neyther fauour nor hate eyther of them. Againe, Selenissa insisteth on the reproach of murder proceeding from loue, and at length lighting on more happy counsell: Why, quoth shee, doe wee lament for Poliarchvs as a dead man? and beleeue with so certaine a griefe, Fame, so oft a lyer? Haue you not heard the errour of Pyramvs so famed in writing, onely that wee might learne how dangerous it is vpon the first apprehension to determine? Who knowes but you may thus draw there abroad? Who saw his corps? Who saw the Sword stayned with his bloud? Perhaps he now being free and merry, contemning his enemies, if you should dye, through your wound would breathe out his soule. Send some who may relate more certainety, and liue at least to this purpose, lest he being aliue, your death destroy him. hope (quoth she) doe you deferre my last sorrow? you can neyther satisfie mee, O Mother, nor your selfe with this inuention. But I will giue this to mischiefe rashly by them done, vpon this condition, that you will not hinder mee, to part my soule and body when I shall heare more certaine newes of his death. The old Nurse, glad at this beginning, who well knew, that desperate intentions arising from griefe, are to be feared in their first motions: but when they begin to suffer pawse, they vanish of themselues: Shee tooke this oath with Argenis , by all the gods and goddesses, but especially by the genius of Poliarchvs , that for two dayes, whatsoeuer shee heard or knew, shee would not hurt her life. The Lady agreeing, and swearing to that no body might take notice of so secret a sorrow; though great were the beauty of Argenis , yet the greatnesse of her spirit excelled it. Shee mastered her sighs, and in a moment put on the same lookes shee had before her sorrow, but that her eyes were somewhat red, which shee cured by bathing them in cold water.  Kingdome: Argenis falls into a swone.  countenance, when one of her Maides knockt at the doore, and told her, the King was entring into the Castle. Argenis presently returnes into her bed- chamber, as though she had beene about some other businesse: and with a more sprightly countenance than the common affaires did require: eyther to take away suspition of her sorrow, or that in such a combat of griefe and dissimulation, all her words and gestures might fall into a iust temper. Being receiued then by the Guard, who attended not farre off, shee passed thorow the great Court, to the gate. The King was not farre off, who taking her vp from her knees, as she was offring to kisse his hand, and afterwards lightly stroking her cheekes, asked her how shee did? He blamed also her wannesse and palenesse, whereby in this fearefull time shee had wronged her beautie. But she answeres, that piety would not giue her leaue but to follow her King and Father, gone to the warres, at least, with her prayers and cares; and taking an occasion of mourning, shee let fall a few teares, which were ready at hand. The King bids her be of good cheere; tells her, the gods had heard her prayers, and wills her to put on those lookes in this time of prosperity, which griefe had defaced. The people encircled them on euery side, honouring no lesse the beautie and vertue of Argenis , than the gray hayres of Meleander . For shee did distribute her smiles, lookes, and graces so cunningly, that the people, taken with her courtesie, shouted for ioy; and none of the Nobility thought themselues slighted, or neglected. The King stayed a little in the Court-yard, enuironed with petitioners, and acclamations, in which, there was a Fountaine, not more notable for the water, than for the imagery, which D aedalvs , they say, had carued for his Guest Coccalvs . The water being drawne to the top of the fountaine, passed thorow many pipes in various formes; then falling into the Cisterne beneath, it boyled by the force of the falling, and waxed green like the Sea. In the middest whereof, Galat aea , as in the Sea, bewayled her newly-dead Acis , who lay on the shore, and as if hee now began to be dissolued into a Riuer, he sent forth two streames, one at his mouth, the other at his wound: in the brinke of the water, the furious image of the Gyant threatning secure Galat aea with another stone. Whom he heard angerly vttring these Verses, which the Artificer had engrauen in the Marble below:  Monster, more flinty than the stone that kill'd My Acis ; than the woods themselues more wilde: A god shall plague thee; whom not knowing Fate, Thou wouldst not suffer in a mortall state. What bootes thy rage? no threats these waters feare. His heart, his euery part's a Fountaine now; Pure as was Acis , doe his waters flow. His lockes, as mindefull yet, doe curling spring, And make within the floating waues a ring. How faire a blush from those blue veines is gone? Yet cold, as is his bloud, his loue's not growne. My Acis gone! those hands, those armes are lost: How much the making a new god has cost? Ah me! lest more his wounds mortality Declare, than sacrifice his deity. stayed with such as met him, fed her selfe with solitary griefe: Shee seemed to her selfe Galat aea , and lamented a better Acis : but who should be the Giant Polypheme ? though shee had poynted Lycogenes for that comparison, yet her fathers fault, against her will, comes into her minde. Now were they entred the Chamber of Presence; when the Nobility stepping aside about their seuerall occasions, almost onely the houshold seruants were about with Argenis , Thy age and Sex, Daughter, quoth he, might excuse thee from publique affaires, vnlesse thy education and spirit had fitted thee for great matters; and that although thou art a woman, the fortune of all Sicily lyes vpon thee, and thou art to reigne ouer men. Vse thy selfe, while I liue, to those cares, without which the royall dignity cannot be supported; and, which is most requisit in a Prince, learne to be silent. Wee are in ill case, of them. For if we bow not at the weight which now oppresses vs, wee may perhaps be broken. You know how Lycogenes is reuolted from mee, and many Cities falne to his faction: but they are most dangerous, which are in my bosome, and diue into my counsels, obseruing mee more truely like a captiue than a King. The battell wee late fought, seemed to shew Lycogenes what I could doe; hee was ouercome, and if the night had not befriended him, his owne fortifications had not kept him from mee; then many of the Nobility with me, & chiefe of my Councell could no longer conceale their affections. They vrged, how necessary it was to make a League; that a strong part of the people fauoured Lycogenes ; whether it were better to saue these, or draw them desperatly to each others destruction, they thought only Parricides made a doubt: and they were so bold, as euen to excuse Lycogenes , how he was only vanquisht in a skirmish, and not in a full war: and furthermore, that it was not expedient vtterly to ruine him; for with what eye would the Sicilians look vpon him, which had robbed them of their chiefe delight? Who would fight more eagerly in his reuenge being dead, than liuing, for his honour: I might therfore take time, being Master of the Field;  & make my peoples peace mine own benefit. I wil not dissemble, Argenis , I was more afraid at these speeches, than when Lycogenes his Ensignes were displayed in the field. I found my dignity betrayed,  & must haue feared a greater mischiefe, if I had refused to be so deceiued. Thou, daughter, wert the onely cause, that I desired rather to hold my Crown vpon any conditions, than to disinherit thee by a violent defence of my owne Maiesty. Neither did they expect Lawes from me, though their King and Conquerour: they brought Articles from Lycogenes , the effect whereof was this; King Meleander , hold Sicily in thy full right; let same gouernement by Sea and Land be reserued to him; let him hold Erbessus and Heraclea with garrisons in pledge. They put in besides a caueat, that I should remember no iniuries, nor punish by any course of iustice, what euer had bin done in this commotion. It stood not, Argenis , with my honour, to receiue conditions of peace, nor with my fortunes to refuse them. I stand between both in doubt; thought to haue done any thing in preiudice of Maiesty: for I know the habit of their Priesthood to be most conuenient, in which, as by their office, they should exhort vs from the Field to a peace; and that being strangers, they would haue more credit in making this reconciliation: they were then at Panormus , and hauing receiued my Letters, which I had written in perplexity, they easily vnderstood my minde: therefore, bringing them sometimes to mee, sometimes to Lycogenes , they seemed to compell vs, as vnwilling to what we most desired. So I agreed to the conditions which two bands, by which hee should hold Erbessus and Heraclea . I had also a speciall care, that vnder pretence of a garrison, hee should not haue there whole Legions, to inuade mee vpon any occasion; and, lest my lenity should be suspected in yeelding to all the requests of mine enemy. I commanded the Ambassadours to certifie this to Lycogenes , and if hee liked the conditions, to returne to vs the next day: neyther made they any long stay, but a sad chance met them, as they came to mee: they met with Poliarchvs . looks, she fained so violent a cough, that what trembling or blushing so ere had befalne her, might be thought from her forcible straining. fate, quoth hee, Poliarchvs light vpon these Ambassadors of Lycogenes , whether on purpose, or by chance, I know not, but hee spared them not with his sword, for three of them were slaine by him; two of them remayned, who returning hot from the flight, came to mee. Here they fill all the Court with tumult, lament the vniust death of their fellowes, and so call in question my faith, that they almost accuse it. And, when calling my Nobles together, I gaue them a meeting; they layde the blame not onely vpon mee: many that were about mee, tooke their parts in complayning. The common cry is, Poliarchvs must be punished for it, lest it should be commonly thought that I sent him to kill them, being secure vnder my protection: and that, for example sake, no lesse punishment than his head should expiate so foule an offence. These things they vrged, more like Commanders than Councellors: but Poliarchvs his great merit toward mee, who in that battell had got me the victory, somewhat withstood it, and his tryed vertue tooke away the suspition of so foule a deed. Cleobvlvs also and Evrymides , and the rest that were faithfull, thought this fact incredible: they thought it fit hee should be heard, and that hee would easily cleare himselfe of the obiection. I promised therefore to send him a Summons to plead his cause: for it would be without example, if hee should be condemned without his answer. His enemies hearing this, were more offended, complayning that iustice was deferred, that Poliarchvs might escape it; for could they imagine, that after so bold a villany he would come in, but by force and compulsion; and that vnlesse hee were hindered, hee would slip out of the Iland, and boast in his owne Countrey, How without punishment, hee had abused Sicily . And when they had long tyred mee with their confused demands, I asked what they would haue mee doe? That Poliarchvs was absent; and to giue sentence in his absence, was in vaine. The voyce of them all was, That his flight should be preuented; and that that were most easie, if I would command the Beacons to be fired, to giue the Countrey warning; and so, the Ports being shut vp, hee should be as it were vnder custody; and an example to all Strangers, that wheresoeuer villanies could be committed, they could also be punished. I thought it expedient, Argenis , for Poliarchvs safety, to agree to their demand, lest denying them the course of Law, I should incense them to worke their owne cruell reuenge: for when hee should come safely to his tryall, many things might happen, which might deliuer him from their fury. In the beginning therefore of the night, the Beacons were fired in search of souldiers tooke to heart his danger. But while I hoped for better things, in the morning came Timonides to mee, the author of most sad newes, telling mee, Poliarchvs was dead. Argenis could no longer gouerne her sorrow: but, ouercome with a swelling sigh, shee first fell on her knees, and then downe, as like to dye. Meleander cryes out: and the company gathered together, she is carryed by the hands of her Maides into her Bed-chamber; there, sprinkling water in her face, and cutting her laces, they made her fit abate. Meleander demanded of Selenissa , what kinde of sicknesse it was, and whether his daughter had before beene troubled with it? and that hee had obserued, while he discoursed with her, some tokens of sicknesse in her; her eyes often wandring, and her colour changing. Selenissa fitly dissembled, that it was two dayes since shee did not eate her meat well; and that shee suspected an Ague; that yet shee knew well, that this fainting in dangerous sicknesse. Whilest they are herein busied, Letters are brought from Lycogenes to the King, in which hee writes, that hee would presently come to the King, that the peace might be confirmed betweene them by oath in the Temple of Pallas : which the King did most religiously reuerence, and that hee would come the next day, if it pleased the King. The King returned answere, that hee liked it exceeding well, and that hee would expect him according to promise. The Messenger being dispatched, hee calls Evrimides , a man both valiant and fortunate: for, beeing but a Youth, hee had once crowned his Countrey in a running match at the Olimpiads ; and againe, at Istmos , in a wrestling, with the seuerall Garlands thereto appertayning, he was gracious with the King, and Captaine of the Guard, and alwaies Gouernour of that Castle or City where the King was, and had shewed an vnblemished fidelity in these last warres. To him, the King giues in charge what hee thought expedient; that the watch and ward should be carefully lookt to that night; that those bands which were knowne to be trusty, should be placed in their stations; and that the Guard should be doubled; that care might bee taken lest he came to the Court, not so confident of the reconcilement made, as trusting to the strength of his owne faction. When he had giuen this charge, he went to supper in his Daughters Chamber, that Argenis might be the better, there (as being a most mild Prince) to refresh his minde ouerburdened with cares. The rest of the night he gaue to sleepe, as much as his cares would giue him leaue. But in the meane time, griefe plotted strange motions in the heart of fresh hurliburlies happening in Timoclea's house.  to deceiue the Seruant. Arsidas visits Poliarchvs , and aduiseth him to leaue Sicily .  death of his Master. The Lady seconding this illusion, being well instructed, enquireth of Gelanorvs before her Seruants, of what death Poliarchvs dyed: and he the more readily dissembled before her that knew the truth. griefe, changeth his language  & countenance. While they are in this discourse, Arsidas commeth; of whose approach when Timoclea heares, shee runnes to meete him at the doore. And when he excuseth, that out of confidence of old acquaintance, hee had turned out of his way to her house; and the Lady telling him he had done her much honour, gaue him thankes; they come into the house, and ioyne themselues to Archombrotvs ; whom It was now dinner time, which the Sicilians , aboue the delicacy of the other Grecians , did obserue: which being ended, when the seruants went to meat,  & Archombrotvs and Arsidas were left alone with Timoclea ; I know, Arsidas , (quoth Timoclea ) you are come to doe a kind office: you seeke and loue Poliarchvs , though now most vnfortunate: hee is in my house, as Gelanorvs told you: what hard fate hath falne on him, I will not now stay to aske; I shall better vnderstand it from you in his company. Then, quoth Arsidas , The gods prosper this secresie in our businesse: but that plot of secresie we now haue in hand, no age shall conceale: but the fortune of your house, Lady, is yet doubtfull. If it shall keepe him safe, and deliuer to the world, when time serues, this great pledge of vertue, it shall bee more famous to posterity, then Italy in Satvrne's preseruations but if polluted: what dire Monsters soeuer are spoken of in Sicily , to this Caue and entry of hell will be infamously applyed. Timoclea had made ready a Torch: which when she had lighted, she led them the way to Poliarchvs . Neither had they beene long in the Caue, when they might see him rising from his Couch, stir'd at the comming of the light: and when he perceiued Arsidas lightly saluting the rest, he fals vpon his necke; and praising his fidelity, hee then asked him, if he durst knowe condemned and hidden Poliarchvs ; and seest thou, quoth hee, this Lady? if these hiding holes be a shame to me, she cannot bee excused: but if by this priuacie I saue my life, I owe it to her. She forced mee in this storme of fortune to liue heere with her. But tell mee, Arsidas , by what offence haue I deserued to be a Sacrifice to Sicily ? is the King, from Meleander , turn'd to be Cercyon or will appease the offended goddesse with the blood of your guests? Arsidas complaining somewhat of Meleanders fortune, declares what a tumult, neere a sedition, Lycogenes his messengers had raised in the Kings Campe, together with some of the false-hearted Nobility; that the King, ouercome with these miseries, when the vprore was at this height, and Poliarchvs was reported to be fled out of Sicily , granted that the Beacons might bee fired. Poliarchvs did heare Arsidas in great choller, often about to speake, and changing his steps thicke; and when he had ended, he tooke gods are alwayes present, yet they doe not still destroy offenders, neither doe they alwayes helpe, when they are rightly inuoked) thou, I say, fight: Did I lye in ambush? did I seeke enemies? did I prouoke them when I met them? They set vpon me vnawares; I must therefore either fall vnder their hands, or if I conquered, all Sicily must be in armes against mee. What token was there of premeditated mischiefe? I was but one, and, which was but a poore assistance in fight, a woman in my company. Your seruants and my man were gone before in the wood, which they thought secure; so farre that the noise of our blowes came not to their eares. But to what hath fortune brought this wretched King? to receiue with honour, like true Embassadours, messengers sent from Rebels and Traitours? to satisfie his enemies thirst with the blood of his friend, and preferre their cruell desires before his owne reputation. While he was yet speaking many things, which griefe and his owne integrity moued him to, Arsidas forbade him to make question of the good opinion of men toward him; and that all men said, except Lycogenes his faction, that it was a rare piece of valour, that one man, and hee furnished for a iourney, not for fight, should escape a Conqueror from the hands of so many theeues: and that the Souldiers laught at them basely complaining, that fiue or more should be oppressed by one alone. But now wee haue more cause to complaine, out a little, and grant to the King that hee bee neither forced to defend thee with a goodnesse preiudiciall to his estate; nor to leaue thee dishonourably in the hands of thine enemies: his offence toward thee is not yet so great, but it may be excused. For the custome heere is so strong, that slaughter must either be punished, or cleared by euidence; that Mars himselfe, they say, for killing Halierhothivs , was faigned to answere it before the Iudges at Areopagus . But if we were assured of a safe and iust proceeding, I would aduise you For nothing as yet is decreed against you, but to appeare before the Iudges; and your cause is such, as may be defended euen against iniustice it selfe. But the hate and impiety of the enemy would not stay for the Iudges sentence, but either by treachery or force would doe you mischiefe; I tremble to speake it. Goe then, Poliarchvs , suffer not this Iland to be altogether wicked. could this vngratefull Land doe lesse, then for so many good offices done, to giue him a quiet departure; and that he was the lesse displeased with the ill- deseruing King, in that he saw him punisht by fortune, to the satiety of his enemies.  A pleasant discourse of a Theefe. Timoclea giueth Poliarchvs a disguised habit, and a false beard. Poliarchvs intreateth Arsidas to assure Argenis of his health.  out of the Iland: and they liked best to put him in a Clownes habit. Messana to his Father in law without suspition. And hauing shipped further tels them, that shee had wherewithall to disguise his countenance exceeding cunningly. There was, quoth shee, in the borders of Panormus , a Theefe, who by a deuice of rare subtilty, liued long time vnsurprized: for he had three seuerall faces, as some old women fable of Geryon : (this said, she staid with a modest smile, as much as might be fitting in so sad a businesse) hee was a man of middle age, his beard short and thinne: but in his pocket hee had two periwigges, to which belonged as many beards; the one was rough and hoarie, like an old man; the other blacke, expressing a man in prime of youth. Hee had fitted with so great Art these disguises, that none could know his counterfeit forme, or mistrust his false visage. Sometimes therefore hee was seene an old man, sometimes younger, sometimes in his owne person. So did this varied shape a long time keepe him freely robbing, not only from punishment, but from suspition: for hauing robbed like a young man, hee would by and by meete the hue and cry in an aged shape: and againe deceiued them in the shape of youth, if he had offended in his gray haires. My Father did then rule the Prouince; who, tyred with the cunning of this wicked Chameleon, at length apprehending him, gaue him a deserued gallowes. But wondering at his witty fraud, so neere imitating Nature; hee commanded the periwigges to be kept with him. If it please you, Ile bring them forth, and wee'l fit them to She staid for their consent, but presently went out of the Caue, and making a speedy returne, brought those double counterfeits of youth and old age. When they had put one of them vpon Poliarchvs , chafing that hee should neede such base disguises to saue himselfe, he became presently so transformed, that successe to this fit deceit, they entreated him to make vse of it. apparell. For it behoued Poliarchvs , euen in that Caue, to bee in an vnknowne habit; that if fortune should bring thither any inquisitiue eye, being confident of his disguise, he might fly to the adioyning Fields. They were now vpon departure, when Poliarchvs cals Arsidas apart; excusing himselfe to Archombrotvs and Timoclea , that he was priuate with him. The reason of his talke was, because Arsidas , his most inward friend, knew the loue betweene himselfe and Argenis : he did therefore earnestly entreate him, not to faile to goe to Argenis as soone as hee could; as being much more grieued for her sake then for his owne: for he knew how heauily she would lament his fate: but how, when she should heare he was dead? the errour of that sad report might driue her louing soule to most cruell and deadly resolutions: that therfore Arsidas would goe and comfort her, lest shee should weepe for him being sate: if the gods gaue him safe passage, hee would stay on the shore of Italy , expecting what shee would command him; or if it pleased her, he would euen then steale a visit through any danger. Time would giue leaue to speake no more, neither would hee commit any more to was now night, Timoclea entreating, and Poliarchvs not disswading, he deferred his iourney till the next morning: when they had supped, they were to returne to Poliarchvs with the clothes which the Lady had promised. He in the meane time fed lightly of such meat as Timoclea brought him. And then Arsidas iesting with him, to auert him from the sense of his ill; Why, quoth hee, valiant Sir, are you griued, that a Caue or borrowed habit should keepe you from your enemies? You beeing but one, fly from many; but all the gods were not ashamed to fly, when Typh aevs alone pursued them: neither perhaps had they escaped, if Æ gypt had not hid them vnder base and bruitish shapes. Heare with what boldnesse your familiar friend Nicopompvs , acquainted with their feares, had put on iawes of beasts, and bills of Fowles vpon their diuine countenances. He gaue him then the booke, in which was Poetry of diuers subiects: and going from him, he markt out with his nayle these Verses for him to reade.  Now had the pil'd vp Mountaines lifted neere The Skie, Typh aevs , when the gods gan feare: Their hearts were downe; their faces blood forsooke, And pale the Starres at heauens surprizall looke. Rough with the winters ayre, and Southern winds Continuall blasts, to heauen stands Atlas ioyn'd, The gods ladder to earth: high heauen does meete His laden head: in Lybia treade his feete. By his large shoulders, by his hoary beard, And all his showre-wet limbes the gods afeared, Slide downe from Heauen: Oh doe not trust the earth, Poore deities; She gaue Typh aevs birth. As when swift-winged feare an heard does chase Of heartlesse Deere; after the first fields space, They make a fixed stand; to heare what sound, From the shrill Hunters Horne, or yelping Hound, The wounded ayre conueyes: then forth amaine Thorow the woods they ply their feete againe; Their feares false shaddow, still does them pursue, Presenting the first terrour to their view. So through the world th' affrighted gods amaine Fly, without stop, or'e Mountaine, Lake, and Plaine. No Caue has night enough their feares to hide. A Land where head-hid Nile his streames diuides, And to the Ocean in seuen channels slides, There is; where first of all mortality (If we beleeue't) saw day; when from the Skie, This Land best pleas'd their flight; vnder the Bay Of Nile , the troupe of gods now wearied lay. Hither the Syluans , and those Nymphes that sport In woods, t'increase the terrour, did resort. Not farre from thence, a flocke of sheepe did feede, Carelesse of fate, to whom the Shepheards Reede A gentle signall gaue: to th' Fold they came, Where the full Ewe suckles the wanton Lambe. These Iove discerning, whilest his fearefull eye Surueyes the fields: Oh happy sheepe! 'gan cry: Must Ivpiter himselfe Fates enuy beare, Whilest this poore flocke no strong Typh aevs feare? You godhead rayes, and hated Maiesty, Farewell: since peace dwels with humility. This said, his limbes in a white fleece he shuts, And crooked hornes on his hid forehead puts: That forehead, that Heau'n, Earth, and Hell could shake, When he, or peace, or dreadfull warre would make. Hee's now turn'd to a Ramme, and with feign'd bleates, Followes the Flocke; and there, not onely cheates His Art; and to the like his wits he raises; But feares the earth, and like a winged Crow, He mounts the aire; and, his new skill to show, Thrice in a ring about the gods he flies: Alas for shame! the fearefull deities See it, and follow: whom now Ægypt beares, In bruite beasts shapes; whilest for themselues they feare. Meane time are bootlesse Sacrifices slaine, And th'vnregarded suppliant vowes in vaine.  A discourse of the ability of some men. How hard they are to be found: and of the difference of deseruing spirits.  Garden, the euening ayre beeing yet wholsome, run thorow diuers discourses: and by reason of Poliarchvs , they fell into dispute of those that excelled in vertue and disposition; what rare ornaments they are in men, and how contemned by dispositions made for seruitude; yet often bearing rule ouer free men. While they thus discourse, the loue of vertue, and lothing of the present state, so far transported Arsidas , that with vehemence he began to shew, how worthy men, without iniustice and danger, could not be slighted: That it is the most pernitious kind of inhumanity, not to aduance worth, and reward it in the eye of the world. Now, saith he, fortune hath taken such a preposterous course, that in many Lands, it is almost taken for a token of worthinesse, to bee driuen from Court, or there neglected; the cowardly or barbarous vices of great men doe so loue to disarme vertue; as if they thought to raise themselues aboue her, by proudly trampling vpon her pouerty and low estate. Archombrotvs , whether desirous to draw Arsidas his wisdome to his own instruction; or whether he tooke vpon him the defence of Kings, said, that for as much as belonged to Poliarchvs , he did abhorre so proud a licence of fortune. But it is no wonder that Kings should sometimes ouer-slip such good parts, being tyred so much with cares and costs: and it were not correspondent, if excellent men should be a burden to the rest, and the best gifts of Nature bee hyred by the common treasury; and oftentimes those minds which we so much admire, are not profitable for Kings vses, or fit for employment in businesse: as some fruites are pleasant to the eye, which if you please to taste, they prooue vnsauourie or vnwholsome. Arsidas delayed to answere, content with a little smile to reiect his defence of so ill a fate; till he perceiued by Archombrotvs his countenance, (for he look't wistly on him) that he was willing to be refuted. Do you obiect the care of Kings, quoth he? as if it ought not to be their chiefe care, to haue such men about them, as the age has but few, that thou mayst condemne him that brought his lanthorn into the open Market place, to find out one. But you will say, the Comon-wealth cannot sustaine the charge? Oh minds too sollicitously wise! therfore to be sparing in the charges of Hawking; not to haue the stables full of dancing horses, as in the Sybaritanian Army; not to fill vp the Kennell, if the Boare chance to kill one of their hunting Dogges: they count it hainous, I say, to omit any of these, not more for the vse and pleasure of the Prince, then for the state of his Maiesty. They can giue way that their gold should be wasted; and that the vilest men should liue vpon the Treasury: but thinke it very burdensome, to haue a select company of great spirits: then, they remember thrift: then, their treasure will faile. No, Archombrotvs , 'tis their goodnesse failes. Suppose, the King do not loue their society: do we only put such things in our treasurie as we naturally fancie, and not things deseruing by their owne worth? Neither doe Kings liue so straited, but that, if they mislike or feare the presence of such men, they may lay them vp as prouision in another place. Neither neede you complaine of the multitude, Archombrotvs ; though you choose neuer so curiously, you may make but few. What sort, quoth weigh the whole matter at large, not reflecting vpon Poliarchvs his misfortune, I would choose thither none out of the the eminent Arts and disciplines; one is excellent in Horsmanship; another at his Weapons; some famous for Limming; some for Musicke: he curious for Architecture; this for Waterworkes, or any other Art, which either for its owne or the times Genius, is acceptable: let them straight be bought, euen at what price they will set vpon themselues, if cheaper they cannot be had: the greatnesse of the price will commend the Artificer, and the magnificence of the purchaser: but I would haue excellent ones, and such as are rarely found. Now what should let vs to set a higher price vpon higher things, the Artes of warre and peace? that is, men eminent in valour and learning. Neither would I thus prize meere rashnesse in Armes or vulgar Muses; but those Captaines, whose warlike spirits are seasoned with reason, and blest by fortune; and those especially whom fame has markt out, which often with light winds giues great auaile to matter of warre. Now the chiefe of learned men are so eminent, that they are oftentimes fewer in the world then the number of the Muses; and their splendour hidden from none but blinde men. Some of them are fit for publike employments: but because the Common-wealth knowes not how to vse so great a blessing of the gods, they oft grow rustie in priuate discontents, not polished with vse and businesse: others, that seeme borne only for their bookes; yet how great their power is, both in the present and succeeding Ages; when according to their fauour or displeasure, they bestowe fame on men; when they can make Sects, and change the iudgements of other men: this power, I say, he that will be ignorant of, deserues to feele by his owne infamy. We are so by nature, Archombrotvs , that euery man delights in somewhat, and those that excell in the thing we loue, wee most admire. Imagine therefore, that the most excellent in Warre, Learning, and all manuall Arts, (for these must needes moue all mindes) were met together vnder one Prince, like many Starres in one heauen: What would the whole world esteeme of such a Court? Who would not know it? nay, who would not (since his god is there) both feare and honour that place as a Temple? But to the Prince himselfe, how great a reward shall follow his endeuour? Hee shall exceede the happinesse of mortality, and finde himselfe already deified, though aliue and safe: with more certaine and noble signes, then the perfume of Frankincense, or an Eagle flying from his funerall pile: there shall bee triumph in true applause: these men shall bee his triumphant Pageants, and the best spoile of all nations; whom he from them all has gathered, like flowres, to adorne his owne Garland. It were a good wish, quoth Archombrotvs , if the multitude of businesses, or the diuersity of affections in them that are about Kings, could giue hope to compasse it. Euen those excellent men, of whom you speake, are not all to bee purchased; and many of them (as it should bee, and you would haue it) are gracious in Kings Courts: that those that misse of such happinesse, may iustlier complaine of fortune then of Kings. Then, quoth Arsidas , I did not thinke it possible, Archombrotvs , that the height of what our desires fancie, can indeed bee brought to absolute and happy effect: but as other wisedome is profitable, though it bee lesse exact in the course of our actions, then in the single contemplation of the soule: so in this matter it will much auaile, where fortune and occasion will giue leaue, not to neglect so greate happinesse: so that if all cannot bee bad; yet as many as can, should be drawne by promotion to the Court. Whereas you say that Kings Palaces are not altogether empty of worthy men; I doe not disagree: but heare mee, Archombrotvs , there is a middle order of wise men, and fit for employment, (as Gentry is in honour) which yet reach not to that height wee now speake of. Of these men, there is more plenty; and that these come oft to Court, I deny not; and when they are aduanced, shine so bright with the borrowed rayes of dignity, that men thinke it the worke of exact nature: as meaner gemmes sometimes by cunning workemanship or the gold they are set in, receiue a lustre equall to the best. To be diligent, to speake nothing rashly, to take paines, to imitate wise patternes, to hide the defects of their owne wit: these things, as they doe not necessarily make an excellent man; so they are sometimes all that you shall finde in a praised great man: so that the absence of vice is called vertue; or that a small streame of wisdome should grow in fame equall to the Ocean: whilest most doe conceiue that agility and practice, whereby they doe enable themselues in ciuill businesse, to bee the greatnesse and perfection of their iudgement. Neither doe I grudge these their praise: it is a great matter for a man to be raised to that height, and grow by his employment. But these are not they, Besides these therefore, (as you said) I haue yet knowne sometimes some of those prime wits of greatest note, to come to Court, and haue employment. For but I may name among those master-pieces of Nature. Meleander has also I doe not therefore account Kings Palaces iust or happy, because they doe sometimes entertaine some few of the number of excellent men: you may name many more despis'd, or, which is worse, violated. That I may haue a iust ground for my complaints: The fault is sometimes in the Kings, when they will not be admonished, or feare vertue: sometimes in their followers, when nature has made them barbarous, too much happinesse carelesse, or fortune proud. Besides, many great men thinke, it is their losse, when any man, besides themselues and their followers, grow richer by the Court. So vertue beeing neglected, they dispose of the Kings affection, perchance being ignorant, among their owne followers. They would doe farre otherwise, if they lou'd their King sincerely; nay in good faith, if they lou'd themselues wisely. For what were more glorious, then by the publike purse to make those men deuoted to them, that were borne to be the ornament of the Age: who would scarce know whether they owed more to the King, or to those that were the meanes of their rising. I cannot but laugh at their blindnes, that care not to obtain from learned pennes, that praise, that shal out liue their wealth and pleasures: and that falls to none, but those that truely seeke it. For as I like not learned men, who will for hire praise the vndeseruing; so I thinke those most iust, that scorne to celebrate the prayse of a disdainefull and proud vertue; or such a vertue, that does not vnderstand the fauour that by learned pennes is done to her. But if the Honey of these Bees please you not, yet doe not by iniury or contempt prouoke their stings; how often has one man, cyther Souldier or Scholler, for a priuate iniury, taken a publique reuenge? how often hath one mans valour swayed an Army? to such men are many people oftentimes slaine as sacrifices. God forbid that Sicily feele not Poliarchvs his anger: For he came voluntarily to the King, and the fault will lye the heauier, that wee did not onely not seeke, but not entertaine so great vertue when we had it. Truely I know not how Meleander wil excuse himselfe to the best of his Peeres, and especially to Ibvrranes , who (they say) comes to day; for hee will be bold to lay this errour to the Kings charge, being a Stranger, and besides a man of great esteeme, and especiall fauour with him.  A company of rusticks enter by force Timoclea's house, and demand for Poliarchvs .  had dwelt so long vpon this discourse; as rather desirous to haue heard from him, vnder what Lawes the Sicilians liued, and what were the chiefe exercises of the Court: for, hauing heard of Poliarchvs , the names of those, that eyther for vertue or vice were notable, hee desired to inquire of some of them. Taking therefore occasion vpon Arsidas his naming of commended him to you? Then said Arsidas , hee was borne in Lydia , and linkt to vs onely in the band of friendship, which Meleanders courtesie hath most inuiolably tyed. But a man so worthy, that all Nations would desire to naturalize him for their owne Citizen. He is of the old Nobility of Lydia , and being brought vp in imployments, hee hath furnished his cheerefull and actiue brest with knowledge and dexterity. And when he came to that wealth, which might support any dignity; he began, being but young, to performe those Offices that belong to the seruice of the gods. He came to places of State, not so soone as his friends hoped; for the opinion of many thought him worthy of it in his youngest man-hood: but it was more for his glory to deserue dignity before he had it. Since has he executed places of Iustice, Ambassages, and gouerned Prouinces; (aske not with what sufficiency:) purchasing euery- where alike repute of iustice and mercy. And although his great hospitality and bounty to the poore, had somewhat decayed his estate; yet such was his vprightnesse, that he did neyther rob the Treasury, nor sell Iustice (from which to abstaine, is now counted a great matter;) nor yet would sell himselfe in receiuing gifts from the King; which others most hunt after. His minde was both merry and seuere, as he found occasion towards vertue or vice: and in his greatest fortune, he is so farre from despising the Muses, because they loue him, that he often admits them into his greatest priuacy, and can with a most delightfull wit rehearse their studies: therefore to him, as to Apollo , resort all those, whom lofty and innocent Poetry has lifted vp aboue the base cares of mortality. And lest the gods should seeme to deny him any thing, they haue ioyned all his kindred in such a harmony of Religion, according to his example, that you would thinke his whole house a Temple. So that not without a presage did his Ancestours giue the Bees for their Armes: from whence may be had, according to desert and time, both stings and hony. But these three dayes he has beene treating of the conditions of peace with Lycogenes : which being done, he is this day expected by the King. The pleasantnesse of their discourse had somewhat spent the night; when Supper being made ready, they entred and sate downe: and now at Table, thinking all well (for they doubted not Poliarchvs his safe departure) they began to lay aside care. But they were not out of their Muscadell, when a company of Countrey-fellowes with a most dangerous rudenesse thundred at the doore of the house. The Porter intreated their fury to giue him leaue first to tell his Lady. But they, with a stubborne pride, demanding entrance, told him, they came with authority. And with these words running at the doore, they breake it downe piece-meale; they had euery one such weapons as his condition allowed, or he had light vpon by fortune: for none of them were compleatly armed. But when they came into the Dining-roome, Timoclea with a suddaine feare fainted: but Archombrotvs and Arsidas , leaping from the boord, drew their swords, which the seruants had brought them, as resoluing, if they were assaulted by that rabble, to sell their liues at a deare rate. But the originall of this tumult was this; A woman of the next Towne, hauing beene that day in Timoclea's house, when shee saw Gelanorvs , a stranger to her, asked, what he was, and heard that hee was Poliarchvs his man. There was then a festiuall kept to Ceres , and many Husbandmen from the neighbouring Villages were met in the Towne called Pthinthia . Thither when the woman came, and found some of them sitting idly together, shee told them she had seene Poliarchvs his man. Presently, quoth one of them, hearing that, What if Poliarchvs himselfe be priuily hid there? Then starts vp another, forward enough to any rash counsell, who with a graue looke tells them, so serious a matter was not to be slighted, and that the whole Towne would be taxed, if Poliarchvs should be concealed in their precincts. And now the same opinion had possest many, when the report increasing, and supposing greater matters, they now, not as a thing doubtfull and questionable, but certainly report, that Timoclea harboured publique triall: that it was a false report they had heard of his death. Vpon what ground they should beleeue it, or who was their Author, they knew not, nor they cared not. And if the gods had not hindered it, these mad mens coniecture had not beene vaine. So oftentimes rashnesse and fortune doe more happily iudge, than doubtfull and laborious industry vpon the best grounds of iudgement. The multitude were violent, and had filled the Market-place with a tumultuous noise, ready to follow any heady ring-leader: and when one cryes out, it must not be delayed, they all runne, and catching what weapons any man could finde, they breake open Timoclea's doores, and thinke they haue light vpon young man of good stature, and a pleasing countenance: all which was found in such attyre they thought Poliarchvs , being a forreiner, wore. Confident vpon these tokens, they make a shout: and, if they had not desired to take him aliue, opprest by the multitude, hee had beene like to haue paid another mans score; and when both in countenance, and with his sword drawne, he addrest himselfe to fight. Then he, whom the rest had chosen Captaine, comming neere the Table, which was betweene them and the Guests, saith: Now thou art a Villaine the second time, Poliarchvs , first deseruing the Kings displeasure, and now drawing thy sword against his Officers. Lay downe thy weapons presently, and yeeld thy selfe to prison. Timoclea shall suffer the same punishment, who hath presumed thus long to conceale thee. When he had spoken, the rest set vp a throat, and with a confused noyse bid him doe it presently. Archombrotvs , though he vnderstood Greeke, yet in their clownish speech perceyued nothing, but that they would haue him to prison. He had no time to wonder, or in that instant danger, to aske what was his fault: but onely, moued with a youthfull courage, hee determined among their slaughters to dye. But Arsidas , borne in Sicily , and skilled in their Countrey Language, held him, rushing on them. Hold, hold thy hand, vnequall and vnnecessary a fight? Shall they be thy Conquerors, which are vnworthy to be conquered by thee? and wilt thou staine by the ignoblenesse of the skirmish, eyther thy death or victory? nor is their fury bent against thee, it is Poliarchvs whom they seeke. Then, turning toward him, who proud of his suddaine gouernement, led this rabble: hee told him, nothing could be well done in a tumult. Why should they be angry, before they found themselues or the King wronged? Hee added besides faire words, that he did not doubt but by his least word, to whom hee then spake, all would be pacified. And if it pleased him to command them awhile to be quiet, they would all obey. The Clownes minde was much mooued with this vnaccustomed honour done to him, and more like a Cryer than a Captaine, he commanded silence. The noyse of the people turned to a hemming; when Arsidas demanded what cause had drawne to armes so great a multitude. The ring-leader answered, they came to apprehend Poliarchvs . Whereupon, Arsidas tooke a deepe oath, that Poliarchvs was not there, nor, for ought he knew, did inioy the light: that they should quiet their mindes, carryed to doe the King seruice with a good, but a blinde and rash loyalty. Hee asked, if any among them knew that Stranger, whom they vniustly intended to binde, were nothing like him. Those that were modestest of the Clownes, first at him: but the rest fell into a rage, and cryed out, to carry away the Kings enemy. When all was husht, though hardly, Arsidas made signes that he would be heard againe: and looking vpon their Captaine, Take heed quoth hee, you be not the Authour of a misdemeanour. It is vnlawfull to iniure this Stranger but if you are determined to make shew of your loyalty by wronging a guiltlesse person, hee shall yeeld himselfe into your custody, vpon that condition you will neyther binde nor fetter him: and when it is day, carry him to the Court. Let those of authority iudge his cause, and let him be punished, if hee haue deserued. Let Timoclea be kept here with a guard, sufficient to preuent her escape, till it be knowne whether shee be guilty or no. You, as well as you can, containe your fellow Towns-men from further violence in this house: this will shew both your wisdome and loyalty to the King. While they were debating of these things, Archombrotvs was not flexible to would be in the power of Clownes and mad-men? or was there any trust in the raging multitude; who in their fury may offend any man without controll? But stomacke relent: And Arsidas vrged with strong reasons, that it was the onely meanes of safety, to suffer himselfe to be led to the King. For why should hee desire to dye? or what comfort could there be in his fall, vnworthily to perish (which the gods auert) in such a confused rabble? While they were thus debating, the heat and violence of the storme began to asswage: for Archombrotvs yeelded to Arsidas his perswasions, and the people were pacified, seeing themselues not onely not contemned, but also to haue preuayled. But then Timoclea seconded their agreement with her winning bounty: causing her hogsheads to bee brought forth, and her old Wine to be pierced; entertayning also the Clownes with her prouision of Oliues. They diuiding themselues into seuerall lodgings, set a watch. In Archombrotvs his lodging, round about his bed, eight of them lay vpon straw brought in for that purpose; and so many more at Timoclea's Chamber-doore. The rest, in the Parlour, and the entries of the House, spent the like night in watching, vntill their drunken heads were ouercome with sleepe; where they lay in the power of their prisoners, if they had had a desire eyther to hurt them, or deceiue them. But if Archombrotvs had fled, Timoclea must haue answered it; for euery body would haue thought it had been Poliarchvs thad had escaped.  hath newes of Poliarchvs his safety: Archombrotvs is brought before the King.  knew, neyther to be Poliarchvs , nor the Master of the house. He hauing aduised with Timoclea , goes to rest into that Chamber where the passage was to Poliarchvs . Then, barring the Chamber-doore, hee descended into the Caue, carrying those clothes with him to Poliarchvs , which the Lady had prouided for his change. He, when he saw Arsidas alone, began to aske him, not without presage of ill, why Archombrotvs and Timoclea came not. He relates to him the fury of the Clownes, and the danger of Archombrotvs ; who trembled at euery word, vntill he heard that had sent, hee intreated Arsidas early in the morning to goe to Argenis ; and from her, with the same trust and diligence, to returne to the Caue with her commands. When they had spent a great part of the night in these discourses, Arsidas goes to bed, hoping to take a little rest: but the snoring and snorting of those drunken Clownes did so disturbe him, that at last, laying aside all hope of sleepe, he, with an angry mirth, cursed those ridiculous souldiers; and calling vp some of the chiefe, hee told them, hee was going to Court: that they, when it pleased them, might follow with their prisoner. The iourney was twelue miles, which hauing speedily finished, hee entred the Court, when very few of Argenis her attendants were stirring. She had spent that night in troublesome cogitations, not without Selenissa's feare: who, remembring her last dayes fury, and fearefull at each turning of her vnquiet body, arose from her Palate, and with a fearefull iealousie, asked how she did? and what troubled her? Selenissa was thus doing her seruice to Argenis , when might, opening Argenis her Chamber-doore, in which Selenissa lay, told the old woman, that Arsidas was without, and desired to speak with her. The time of the day, not yet fit for salutation, (especially knowing that he was come to bring some newes, concerning those things that so much had troubled them: but if hee brought sad tidings, it was not fit for Argenis to know it. Shee willed one therefore to leade Arsidas into the next Chamber; whither her selfe comes, hauing onely put on an vnder-petticoate: and when they were alone, shee thus began: I know, Arsidas , thou com'st to bring some newes of Poliarchvs : speake, man, doe wee liue? or are wee dead in his death? Arsidas would not suffer her to be in suspence any longer, but told her, that Poliarchvs was in good health, and that he came from him to Argenis. Selenissa ouer-ioyed with the newes, drew Arsidas hastily into Argenis her bed-chamber. And when he was on his knees at her bed-side, Selenissa vsing no circumstance (for her hasty ioy would not suffer her:) Madam, quoth she, Poliarchvs is aliue, and well: Arsidas is come to bring your Highnesse health. Argenis was now almost spent with teares, and euen then when Selenissa came, lay languishing, almost hauing forgot her griefe; and now, strooke with this vnlook't-for comfort, she was in more danger with this suddaine ioy, than before with griefe: but when she was come to her selfe againe, commanding Arsidas to speake, she sate vp in her bed; and looking earnestly on him, when she heard him say, that Poliarchvs remembred his seruice to her; and, hauing escaped his enemies hands, was concealed in a safe place; her heart so leaped within her, that as yet not hauing shak't off her feare, she compelled Arsidas to take an Oath, that those things were true which hee had told her. He affirmes, that Poliarchvs himselfe, if it pleased her to command him, would wait vpon her; and to that purpose had disguized himselfe in an vnknowne haire and Beard; and had clothed himselfe in the habit of a Countrey Peasant: neyther forgot hee to tell her of the violence of the Clownes, which had disturbed his last nights Supper: how furious they were, and how at last pacified; and how they were bringing to the Court a gallant young-man, and one that loued Poliarchvs well, in stead of Poliarchvs . It was not enough to tell this once ouer to her: but at last she bade Arsidas goe to Meleander , and tell him of the comming of the Countrey-people, lest to returne againe to her; she in the meane time would consult, what was best for Poliarchvs to doe, and whither he should goe. Scarce was Arsidas dismissed out of Argenis her chamber, when those rude country-fellowes were entred into the City, guarding Archombrotvs in the midst of them: and when the souldiers of the Watch asked them, What they would? or, what they brought? They replyed, That they had taken Poliarchvs , and brought him to the King. Being receiued within the walls, they came to the Castle: from which being barred out, when Evrymides asked, Who they were? or, whom they sought? They answered with the same errour, That they came to deliuer Poliarchvs to the King. Evrymedes hearing this, being both glad that Poliarchvs was aliue, and grieued for his danger, desired them to shew him Poliarchvs . They all together poynted at Archombrotvs . The Gouernour not looking long vpon the Stranger, told them, that was not he. And now were they suspected, and commanded to lay downe their weapons, looking specially vpon Archombrotvs , What dreame is this, quoth he, O young man? Why dost thou faigne thy selfe to be Poliarchvs ? He makes answere, that he neuer tooke that name vpon him, neyther of his good will was hee brought thus attended to the Court, and that the mistake of these Clownes should not bee layde to his charge. While they speake thus, Arsidas came, and by Meleanders command, brought them all into the Court-yard. There them, who now vnderstood their errour, and promised that the King would be euer mindeful of their faith and loyalty, and aduised them to keepe in all actions the same hearts  & hands, which ought nothing to any, but to the gods, and the King. Then, as hee was commanded, he brought Archombrotvs to the Kings presence. To whom Archombrotvs , after due honour and obeysance, thus spake: May it not be ominous, O King, that the first time I see your face, I come in the nature of a guilty man: it was the height of my desires to come to your Court, vpo which purpose I left my Countrey, to seeke Sicily , as the happiest of all Lands in your gouernment: and though I was vnwilling to be brought into your Presence by such as these; yet I thinke it fell not out without a purpose of the gods. For as far, O King, as I can learne, no man was a truer seruant to your affaires than Poliarchvs ; nor more valiant in the field. Why should I not then glory that I was thought worthy to be brought in his stead? but though I would yeeld to him in worth, yet in honoring your Maiesty, I will indeuour to compare with him: neither am I presumptuous in mentioning Poliarchvs ; he is accused, I know, but giue me leaue to praise and defend his memory, not yet by you condemned: but if it please you to vse these armes and this hand, you shall know, my life is not so deare to me, as your seruice. Whiles Archombrotvs thus speaks, Meleander eies him with a constant look; his youth, his countenance, his vigorous eyes, and his neither sad nor light behauiour did become his speech: and when hee had done, the King first gaue him thankes that hee had chosen his Court: hauing had experience in all seruices, that none were truer to him, than those that from other Countries had freely brought to Sicily vertue, not natiue nor obliged; and then deliuered him his right hand; which hee taking in his owne hand, humbly kissed. The King then tooke him vp, and imbraced him (for hee diuined great matters of him:) but hee being asked of his linage and Countrey, answered nothing, only that he was borne in Affrica : and though nothing else from him. Being then asked more peremptorily, how hee came so well acquainted with Poliarchvs ; whether they were country-men, or kinsmen, or friends onely; He told the whole story without dissimulation, excepting onely his concealement by Timoclea .  A discourse of the fashion of seuerall Nations: Court-newes of Poliarchvs his apprehension: Argenis her strong resolution: Heraleon is apprehended.  ignorant people thought, because Poliarchvs was a stranger, that he alwaies vsed a forreine habit. But hereafter, quoth Archombrotvs , I will no more be punished for this fault of my Countrey attyre: I will put on a cloake, and fashion my selfe to their customes, for whose instructions I came hither. Nay, quoth the King, tarry till you like vs better: custome will lessen the strangenesse of our attyre. It may be now, we seeme strange to you: your thoughts are yet filled with representation of your old society,  & your countries fashion not yet wip't out of your mind: but when you are fully acquainted with our company, you'l wonder at the alteration, and not indure it. I my selfe remember, when trauelling, a yong-man, into Affrica , I laught at their fashion, so much diffring from ours; but when custome had made them allowable to mee, and I returned into Sicily , I did no lesse disdaine the habit of my natiue soyle, vntill familiar sight of them had reconciled my liking againe to them: So that there is nothing more vniust, than to condemne those things which our selues doe not, or see not: especially when whole Nations agree in it. For when onely time makes them please vs, it is apparant, that in that they at first displeased vs, it was not their fault, but our ignorance. And it is to be thought, that all Countries haue both manners and habits agreeing to their clime: which the genius of the Countrey will infuse into you, if you haue stayed long enough to conceiue it. Let nothing therefore, but vertue or vice, greatly mooue you eyther in your owne Countrey, or in a forreine. But I desire, kinde Stranger, that all things here may accord to your custome and liking. While Meleander speakes thus, and with an old mans ambition playes the Philosopher, Arsidas in the meane time easily slips to Argenis , and prayses Archombrotvs , who in his first admittance to the Kings presence, had mentioned Poliarchvs with honour. But when the Princesse and her Nurse were greedy in hearing the Strangers resolution, a suddain report came into the chamber, that Poliarchvs was taken, and bound, and brought to the King. Argenis not affrighted, and thinking they ignorantly talked of another that was brought in stead of Poliarchvs . One of her Maides answered, and told her, it was farre otherwise than shee thought: euery body knew that the Stranger young-man, whom the Clownes had brought, was not himselfe, and changed his cloathes, was brought to the King; and that some were sent before to the Court to certifie the newes. Argenis was strooke dead with this thunder bolt, and yet not more than Arsidas and eare of Argenis , O Madam, saith he, Fortunes spite has gone beyond all our cunning. We are vndone, Madame, vnlesse you now dare openly defend no doubt but the misfortune is too true. And shee seeming to bee heartned with the last and worst of euils; When, quoth shee, newes was brought vs of sorrow could answere those sad tidings: now, when hee may liue, and his death is feared; let all plagues fal on me, if eyther I procure not his life by my diligence; or die in his suffring. I will goe to my father: my silence would be now a sinne. He shall at length vnderstand how much hee is indebted to omitted no vertue to auoid ruine. Selenissa was affrighted at her bold resolution, fearing the Kings anger, if what she so long had concealed fom him, Argenis her selfe should now confesse. But there was neyther place nor reason now to disswade her; all must be left to the hands of Fortune. For her at first, as in a suddaine businesse, and presently after followed The King was then in his Garden, carefull himselfe for Poliarchvs , who was certainely reported to be in hold. Vnhappy old man, and neuer quiet from Fortunes vexation! What should he say or doe? all things crosse, all things tur'nd into new sorrowes? It is now almost two dayes, since hee had so wept for Poliarchvs his death, that he seemed to haue done his last friendly office, and washt away his faults in teares. Now the Fates had brought it againe in question; and whether should he now offend against the young man, or by an vnsafe iustice, vndoe the now-begun peace in Sicily ? And now those that deadly hated Poliarchvs , were all assembled, and said, While that youngman liued, no peace could be firme in Sicily . Archombrotvs was by, and no lesse pittying the King than Poliarchvs , expected till mens desires breaking forth, hee might know Poliarchvs his friends from his enemies. A little before was Ibvrranes come, and with Dvnalbivs , a Priest of like dignity, who was then in Court, had consulted how to defend King: her wisdome so farre gouerning her griefe, that shee would not make knowne her cause, before need required it. Her resolued death, vnlesse she preuayled, made her confident; and casting her eyes round about vpon Poliarchvs his enemies, she was incensed beyond emulation it selfe. No body there, either hated or loued Poliarchvs , but in extremity.  A discourse of madnesse: what Heraleon is. The comming of Licogenes .  to the doubtfull euent; Evrymedes comes in, leading Heraleon by the hand, whose madnesse had now made him famous at Court: And this, quoth hee, is our Poliarchvs ; this is hee, that by the husbandmen is brought backe from flight. Then Heraleon , falling on his knees, and holding vp his hands, asked pardon. The King, now somewhat merry, asked him what was his offence. Nothing, answers he, but because I am Poliarchvs . They all bursting out in laughter, the King asked Evrymedes if this were done in earnest or in iest? Then said Evrymedes , As I stood at the Castle gate, by your command, there to receiue Poliarchvs , if hee were brought, I saw a great troupe of husbandmen enuironing Heraleon : hee that seemed to be the Ring- leader, attributed much to his owne fidelity, that they had safely bound laughter, demanded by what happinesse they had light vpon this prey? Those of our neighbours, quoth hee, that did first rise this morning to their dayes worke, wondring that this man should ride through vncouth wayes, and striue to reach the top of a troublesome hill, determined first to tell him he was out of his way, and after, vpon suspition to follow him. He, as if he had shun'd all men, wheresoeuer he met any body, turn'd away his horse, whom with often winding he had at length tyred; and hee himselfe, now afoote, had runne headlong into an adioyning Caue, and hid himselfe. Now many of vs were gathered together to this sight; and ioyning forces, we entred the Caue; and when we had brought him forth, shaking and crying out, and asked who he was, and why he concealed himselfe? he told vs of his owne accord, that he was easily induced to beleeue, that hee in a changed habit had made an escape: we staid not, but bound him, though he struggled, and, as you see, haue brought him to the King. When the Clowne had made this Oration, I prais'd their fidelity, and sent them all home: and this man,  o King, I heere set before you: doome him as it please you. Whilest Evrymedes thus spake, those that were most sad, could not refraine laughter at this accident. For they knew Heraleon to bee so farre gone in his distraction; that he commonly boasted himselfe to be Poliarchvs. Archombrotvs was the onely man that knew nothing of this conceit: whom Meleander calls to him, as hee was enquiring of those that stood by him, what the matter was, and thus spake of Heraleon . That thou maist the more wonder, Archombrotvs , hee is not so mad in other things: he gouernes his houshold wisely: hee remembers his businesse: in his actions and discourses not foolish, vnlesse the speech tend to Poliarchvs : then, as if stung with a gad-Bee, his madnesse seizes him: then his name is transferred to another. It is more then sixe moneths agoe, since his mind was troubled with this Goblin: and perchance, when the Beacons were fired for and these ignorant men, hauing no consideration of his lookes or madnesse, haue thus punished him for the man whom he named himselfe. But if you will let vs heare him answere; tell mee therefore, Poliarchvs , what cause made thee fly? Nay, answeres Heraleon , What made thee,  o King, force mee to fly? Of my acquaintance, and others, there was none but gaue me counsell to hide my selfe: and vnder this coorse habit I thought I might haue hid my flight. Oh that I had neuer been Poliarchvs! Meleander , about to laugh, turned aside, but by and by moued with a sudden commiseration of mans nature, which so many euils afflict in the best part of it, besides the iniuries of fortune, and the body too weake to beare his own miseries. The Kings Phisician was by, named Philip : hee being asked, superciliously described the distemper of the braine, which did as it were leaue the chiefe part of the mind vncorrupted, and infect with madnesse onely one part: and all did wonder how this should happen to Heraleon . The diuisions of the braine, quoth he, are loose in such men, and too apt by their own thinnesse, to receiue the images of things which wee call phantasies; these being once imprinted in that thinne substance, and obnoxious to them by its owne lightnesse, whithersoeuer it be moued, it is therefore hard to blot out againe, because for the most part they delight with a kinde of sweetnesse, and doe moreouer giue as it were a tincture to the mind, not otherwise changed into other colours but by violent succeeding shapes of seueral things. It is impossible therefore that such braines should be euer idle, being alwayes immoderately either sad or merry, by the violence of intruding thoughts. But if these men encline especially to any one affection, they still haue it in their minde, and still feede it with delight, beeing present before the eyes of their vnderstanding; whether it be pride, or couetousnesse, or impatience of reuenge, or whatsoeuer our troubled desires lay before vs. And being this way of themselues enclined, if any thing touch them on that part, they are presently disturbed; that what they haue a long time desired to be, they beleeue is so indeed; neither now doe their imaginations (since their minds by custome are ouercome) present that thing, as wisht for, but as true and present. But this great change, is either from a habit increasing, and euery day more afflicting; or from some sudden violence, which comming vnawares, and strongly, fills, as it were a whirlewind, the troubled imagination. But why, will some say, doe not minds so affected, in such stormes altogether perish? They doe oftentimes; yet sometimes, onely the contemplation of that thing that was too much in the mind, growes ill. For as one member of the body, beeing ill-affected, drawes ofttimes to it selfe the corruption of all following humours, so that nothing ill remaines to infect the sound parts; so in this Heraleon , and who-euer are like him in this merry madnesse, the fault of their minds being spent vpon one desire, giues them leaue more quietly, and almost without preiudice, to contemplate and vnderstand other things; and lastly, to liue like other men; so that it seemes wonderfull to most men, that either their other wisdome does not rectifie their madnesse, or their madnesse destroy that. You should haue added (quoth Meleander ) that almost all men doe suffer vnder this kind of madnesse: for who is there, that does not imagine to himselfe somewhat more dangerous or more foolish, then that hee is gods. Hee thinkes nothing so good as pleasure; and hee, that the gods punish not vice: to conclude, few men but are madder then Heraleon ; but onely that more couertly, or agreeably to the worlds Genius is their frenzie: and so much the more to be lamented, because they will not shake off their madnesse, and Heraleon cannot. All this while was Heraleon on his knees, thinking the King was turned aside to determine of his punishment. Neither were there some wanting, who turned the King to this merry spectacle of Heraleons vaine feares, and had prepared the plot; some, as entreating remission of his punishment; others, as calling out for Iustice. But Meleander trembled at the memory of that Worthies name, whose ruine he had accounted a sinne in himselfe; therefore hee bade Heraleon depart, and feare nothing; telling the company, that he had iested enough in serious matters. For it was told him that Lycogenes was comming; whom with what countenance hee should receiue, and with what words salute, he was then pondering. At length hee departed into his bed-chamber, and leaning his hand on the next Chayre, he began to discourse with Argenis . For Lycogenes had entred Magella with a small retinue, and those vnarmed, the more to shew his confidence; being proudly secure, not by his owne integrity, but the Kings good nature, and the strength of his faction about the King. Hee would needs come vpon Poast- horses, to auoyd the trouble of a longer traine, and the enuy of the time. Some of the Kings friends, and amongst them, Timonides , commanded by with pride, from the Castle gate, to the Chamber where the King was. confidence did more set foorth; and seeing the King with Argenis , hee bowed himselfe after his manner, to the ground. Going then a little further, he salutes them with a second obeisance: neither did Meleander as yet vouchsafe him any looke, turning his countenance vpon Argenis , as talking with her. But when Lycogenes drew within a little distance, the King suddenly with a smooth countenance looked vpon him; and offering at his knees, he gaue him his hand to kisse; adding withall, that he was heartily welcome, neither wanted there any courtship to confirme their new friendship. But of cunning, that retaining still his great spirit, he might neither seeme base to the King, nor faile to giue assurance to those of his owne faction (of which many were by) that yet vnder his leading, the fury of warre might be renewed. He excused briefly the necessity (as he called it) of his taking armes; as driuen thereunto by those that laid snares for his life; and hee would not haue expected publike assurance, or capitulations of Leagues, but onely to bee secured from those enemies that were about his Maiesty. Meleander answered, that not onely all hatred ought to be abolished, but all mention of it; and that the next day in the Temple of Pallas , the gods should be witnesses of their reconciliation. From thence they passed into diuers discourses; both of them professing gladnesse, and which is the vilenesse of Courtship, loue to each other. dinner for Lycogenes and the chiefe of his friends; whither also hee had inuited some of the Nobles of the honest faction, amongst whom was the King, hee yeelded to none of the Sicilians . Hee was chiefe in the seruice of the gods; in the ranke of the noble Priests; and had adorned this dignity with excellent endowments of the mind; stout, and fit for businesse: happy both in making and keeping of friends; amongst good men open-hearted. In so great a felicity of nature, the excellency of his learning shined, and society of all the Muses, of which, his actiue vertues for businesse and employment, had excluded none. Neither did these things scape vncrossed; Fortune oft vsing in worthy men to punish the loue of Vertue, and desire of Learning. For hee had an Vncle that was chiefe Priest; whom, being about to aduance his deseruing kindred, an Ague tooke so suddenly away, that the Torches of his Inauguration gaue light, together with his Funerall fire. Deiected from this hope, and with new danger sent abroad Embassadour, he almost vnder-went the enuy of the times; for that Countrey began to bee troubled with suddaine commotions; that it was most difficult in that turbulent time, either to please them being diuided in factions, or to draw armed and obstinate men to wholsome counsel: but he most valiantly swomme out to the shore. And then as it hapned, he was in Sicily , when these troubles beganne, most seruiceable both by his loue and counsell to the King. And amongst his friends came Nicopompvs , whom Evrymedes had inuited to the same Dinner.  A discourse of the seuerall sorts of Gouernment.  their Mead, they fell into talke of Bees; a young man, Nephew to Lycogenes , by name Anaximander ; either to please his Vncle, by whom hee knew the power of Kings was opposed; or else to make shew of his own Philosophy, denyed that to be true, which is reported of the Bees, that they haue a King: but said it was a fiction that deluded the vaine and credulous antiquity, who also beleeued that Swans did sing, and layed an aspersion of trembling vpon Lyons, whensoeuer they did heare a Cocke crow. He added to these many like things; which the vntry'd authority of our Ancestors had deliuered to fame for truth; but that all creatures by the course of nature desired liberty, and not a King, or the insolency of anothers gouernment. When he had spoken these things, it grew to a common argument at the table, what kind of gouernment amongst men was the best and iustest. Anaximander made no question to preferre that, in which the people or the Nobles gouerne: for why should all things depend vpon one mans will? whom, if he grow vicious, no feare or modesty can restraine: who by his cruelty and bad example, may deepely wound the Common-wealth: and lastly, that so vses his Countrey and Subiects, as if Nature had made them all for his sake. But with how much more alacrity would the people bring their substance to the common Treasury, when that money shall be so disposed by the wisedome and fidelity of many, that euery priuate man may lawfully claime a share in it; then when at the pleasure of one Prince, it shall be lauishly powred vpon Fauourites, or men vnworthy, by an improuident and cruell bounty? Besides, how many more would fit themselues to serue the Common-wealth; would exercise their wits, practise the warres, or peacefull eloquence; and lastly, seeke the good opinion of their fellow Citizens; whe they knew by their suffrages, that there were rewards to be had for vertue, and the chiefe dignities of the Common-wealth for desert; then when the disposall of these things is confined to the pride of one house, and scarce euer conferred by desert, or by the iudgement of comon fame vpon honest and industrious men? Or was it possible there could be so much wisdome  & courage in one King, as to compare with so many Senators, as in free Cities doe vsually beare sway? Besides, those Senators chosen comonly at fitting yeeres, and for eminent vertues; and who for feare of disgrace or emulation of vertue, will aduise and doe the best for the Comon-wealth: but Kings sometimes are spoil'd with flattery; sometimes of such dispositions, as will not heare good counsell: besides, the minds of Kings (though otherwise vpright & noble) are oft spoil'd with this conceit; that how worthily soeuer they behaue themselues, they can hope for no further reward, being already at the highest & how-euer they offend, there is no Tribunal to cal the to account. He concludes therefore, that nothing is more sweet or agreeable to nature then liberty; which liberty those people only enioy; that liue vnder their own lawes, that haue power to make or pull down their Magistrates: neither, saith he, whe I speak this, do I forget who I am, or in what Land; I know I am subiect to the King of Sicily ,  & that kind of gouernmet, vnder which a man is born, ought best to please him. But as men which are of sickly costitutions, must indeed of necessity loue and cherish their owne weake bodies; but yet may lawfully behold the happinesse of other men of more sound & healthfull constitutions; so do I honour and obey the royall dignity, to which I am bound by condition of my birth; but withall admire the liberty of free States, which depend onely vpon themselues. Neither in this doe I wrong my Soueraigne Meleander : whose vertues if all Kings could equall, nothing were more diuine then Kings, nor no gouernment amongst men, more worthy then the Royall. brought vp in learning from his childhood; but scorning to dwell altogether in his bookes, beeing but a young man, hee left his tutors, that in the Courts of Kings and Princes, as in a true and free schoole, hee might lay the foundation of a publike life: and so together bettered himselfe both in study and employment; being both by birth and condition fit for such a life; and beloued by many of the great Ones, especially by the King himselfe; whose cause, and the right of other Kings being now about to maintaine; What wouldst thou doe, quoth hee, Anaximander , vnder a popular gouernment, that takest to thy selfe heere so great a liberty both of thinking and speaking? beleeue mee, in a popular state you durst not so freely praise Monarchies, as you haue heere extoll'd Democraties and Aristocraties, from whence you may vnderstand this to bee the true, and the other a painted liberty. Since you appeale to Nature, which hath bred in all liuing creatures a loue of liberty; you were as good from that argument put downe all kinds of gouernment; for there are Lawes and Magistrates to obey as well in popular states, as Monarchies; which in the same kind do agree or differ from the liberty of nature. If mankind of their owne accord could bee contain'd within the bounds of iustice, all kinds of gouernment in that vniuersall goodnes were not only needlesse, but vniust; in compelling men naturally iust, to vndergo an vnprofitable bondage. But since, from the wickednesse of men, so great happines cannot be hoped for; that forme of gouernment comes neerest nature, that forbids men to wander from the rules of vertue, or of nature it selfe; that the matter is not how many or how few are Gouernours, but vnder what gouernment the people liue best. You haue played fast and loose, in confounding Democracy and Aristocracy, which are far different from each other; for to ensnare vs with a shew of liberty, you mention the peoples power;  & to shew vs the commodity, you speak of the wisdome of Senators. But if you speake of those Comonwealths in which the people gouerne, what can the wisdome of the Senators doe there? when the peoples leuity shall oft bestow offices vpon men ignorant & vnworthy, and their giddy heads carried away with enuy, violence, & faction; when oftentimes it shall be a signe of a great vertue, to be punisht by the iniudicious people. But if you insist vpon an Aristocracy; for shame, Anaximander , doe not prefer such a Senate before a Monarchy; which by multiplying the number of masters, encreases the basenesse of the bondage; for in stead of one Soueraigne, you make as many, as a ful Senate consists of men. But you will say, all publike businesses are better dispatcht by many, than by one King; as if Kings did not vse to haue their Councels; and those Aristocracies which you so praise, did not oft tread awry; whilest euery one studies his own benefit, fauouring their friends, and emulating their fellow Senators. But (as you say) the industry of young men will bee better encouraged to study or labour by rewards there; and those Comon-wealths wil flourish with more famous wits; but Kingdomes, as auerse to all studies and all vertues, will goe to ruine. In which state is this, I pray? in a Democracy? in which wicked and factious spirits by flattery, cunning carriage, and deceitful eloquence, vse to apply themselues to sedition, fury, to mis-leading or deceiuing the people; so that in such a state, excellent and ambitious wits are seldome borne, but to the ruine of the Common-wealth. But in an Aristocraty what hope is there for industrious men, which is not greater in a Monarchy? there (as you know) all power  & offices of state are confined to certaine Families: so that not desert, but blood carries all dignities; except such meane offices as cannot free them from the seruitude of the Nobility. And yet those meane offices that may be gotten, are they bestowed, thinke you, but on the friends or followers of those great men? that you should not thinke a man in those states can better thriue then in Monarchies by eloquence or the studies of vertue; but by grace, friendship & priuate dependances. Besides, imagine, that both a Monarchy and an Aristocraty, by reason of their Princes vices are diseased: in which shall you finde the easier cure? A King, and his vices, death at the vttermost can take away; and better things may be hop't for from his successor: but a corrupted Senate not many deaths can purge; for their maners once tainted, grow still worse and worse, till with their owne fall they crush in pieces the Common-wealth. Whilest Nicopompvs thus discoursed, Lycogenes feared enuy, because the royall dignity had bin opposed especially by his Nephew. Besides, it was not profitable for his purpose, who did not striue to abolish, but to get a Kingdome. Another argument seemed fitter for his purpose: since the discourse was thus farre; to accuse the custome of those nations which tyed themselues to the seruice of one family; and extoll chose that after the death of euery King, chose his Successor. This argument best pleas'd Lycogenes ; for ambitiously aiming at Meleanders Scepter, he thought by a tumultuary election of the people, he might in possibility attaine it; as also, because because in the Colledge of Priests, the highest honour is obtained, not by birth, but election: thus therefore he interpreted Nicopompvs ; The day, quoth he, will be spent Nicopompvs , before you can expresse what may be discoursed on both sides: for which of the Philosophers has not found out some arguments to vphold both Monarchies and popular States? And I am of your opinion, that vnder one man, the Common-wealth is best gouerned; but heere beginnes a doubt, whether the people were better tye their Allegiance to one family, or keepe in their owne hands, a power to elect whom they esteeme of all the most worthy? For where the liberty of election is, those that are borne of Royall blood, wil better addict all their studies, as being certaine that they cannot succeed their Ancestors in their Scepters, vnlesse they imitate them in those vertues, for which they were chosen Kings. And those Kings will be euer thankfull to the people, as mindfull that they receiued the Crowne from them: and vse their authority with greater modesty. But if as borne slaues, we vndergoe the yoke, we are not at all respected: and if wee refuse it, it is called treason. Besides, when fortune, as it were in a iest, shall cast the Soueraignety vpon an infant, or a foole, what can be more ridiculous then this lamentable succession? the wickednesse of the great Ones will neuer stay till such a King grow of age; but when his yeeres are ignorant and vnprofitable, are contemned; such mischiefes are oft done, as many yeeres of happinesse cannot repaire. For then all officers reigne: all spoile the people; who now trod vpon, not by the King alone, but by others, want this comfort in their misery, that they are not thus abused by men honourable enough. And if when the Master of a Ship dies, though neuer so deseruing, we doe not choose into his place his ignorant sonne, lest he should cast away whom the other has saued: and if in a Schoole of Philosophy, when the Master dyes, not the next, but the wisest is chosen into his roome; why should we put into a childs hand this taske of gouerning, the hardest of all other, and whose errours cause a publike ruine? So that if to reigne, be their inheritance, it is our inheritance to be vndone. But I should better giue allowance to this custome, if I did thinke that Cities were built, and people created onely for Kings sakes: for then let them destroy what is their owne, and let the people endure that fortune which the gods haue allotted them. But if we confesse that this dignity was found out to preserue the people, I wonder our Ancestors did not take care, that out of it a greater calamity might not arise, then by it can be preuented. But these things, shall approue to vs this custome of election in Princes, which you in your holy Consistories obserue in choosing your high-Priests. that passe, that he must either agree to Lycogenes , or argue the case against him; besides, seeing all mens lookes vpon him, especially opinio, when al mens intent silence inuited him to speake, he thus began: I know, Lycogenes , you haue spoke this, more to shew your selfe a Philosopher, then to expresse your true opinion. Vnlesse piety to our profession so far transport you, that because we by voyces choose our high- Priest, you would in all cases haue the same custome obserued, but confound not the Laws of the Scepter  & the Priesthood; you may obserue many differences in the courses of them. For seeing a Law of sacred antiquity hath forbid vs to marry, how shall we leaue our robes of Priesthood to our children, hauing none at all? There are besides, many things in our Sacrifices, which we in our own person must doe, and not command others; if therfore this office should by inheritance descend vpon a child, what would become of the altars, the temples, and worship of the gods? which must neither be comited to prophane persons, or such as are not enter'd in holy rites. So likewise are we taught, not to labour in geting riches, or encumber our selues in any mortall cares; but to account heauen our house, our family and posterity: nor that those things are ours, but the gods; which let vs vse them, but not leaue them to our posterity. But if the Robes of the Priesthood should belong to one Family, how long, thinke you, would they make account that they receiued this greatnesse from the gods? or raigned not to themselues, but to the gods? or that the King or people could endure the pride of such a kindred? who now, without any emulation, or suspition of seruility, subiect themselues not as to any race of men, or rather, not as to men? But in ciuill gouernments, which consist of riches and strength; whose end is to keepe the people in peace, and curbe the boldnesse of wicked men by armed Lawes; there are many things that declare the benefit of succession: of which the chiefe almost, is to disarme the ambition of great men, who in hope of the Crowne, would make combustions, and assault the Kings person. Imagine therefore, that custome of election (which you so praise) should be among those noble and stirring nations, which now quietly obey hereditary Crowns; what, think you, would the Peeres do, who can now hardly endure a Soueraigne? Euery man would conceiue ambitious hope of being King himselfe; euery one would despise the King, which had beene of their ranke, and should leaue children of their degree. But when the fortune of reigning hath beene long planted in one Stocke, the reuerence of the deceased Kings does so liue in their posterity, that euen the Cradles of those Children so borne, doe with a secret confession put vs in minde of our estate; neither doe we disdaine to obey them whom, wee knew, before they were borne, were borne to bee Kings; and without doubt, somewhat greater than ordinary is infused into those mindes, which are borne and brought vp for Soueraignty; whether nature, or education, or the care of the gods doe it. For certainely the long custome of being honoured, takes away in them, all edge and taste of pride; and a strong confidence of commanding, is nourished in them, which, for the most part, as it is not contemptible, so it growes not hatefull; being commonly accompanied with a courteous nature, and familiar among the Peeres; to whom he need not blush, in remembrance of any meane estate that hee euer heretofore has liu'd in, hauing beene alwayes at the same height; their thoughts are accustomed to great matters, and they labour for the good of their Kingdome, as being the patrimony of their owne children. But he that by election is raysed to this top of honour, cannot forget his former meane estate, into which his children must againe fall. Therefore, from the well administring of the Common-wealth, he is called aside by a neerer care; that to his sonne or his neerest kinsman hee may procure the fauour of those, in whose power the election is: or at least so farre inrich his Family, that all men may take notice that one of that House had reigned; so the publique ornaments of State, and the publique Wealth, are by hooke or crooke swallowed into priuate Families; and what the deuotion of old times did ordayne for publique benefit and splendor, is profusely wasted, by a most sad errour, to set a glosse vpon an vnknowne House: neyther doe such Kings hurt the Common-wealth onely by their owne misdeeds, but by the offences of the Great men, whose friendship they seeke by all pernicious fauours, that they may elect their children after them. They feare not to be profuse in gifts, and fearefull to wrong the next King (for who shall be hee, among so many Great men, they cannot tell) who after their decease may reuenge it vpon their posterity. Prayse you therefore, if it please you, the wisdome of election, which euery day obtrudeth new Families, to be, as it were, fatted with the losses of the Common-wealth. The Aquilij themselues chosen out of diuers Families and Nations, how oft haue they lost somewhat of the strength of their Maiesty, being betrayed by such cares? Among them, hee that was Author of the Golden Sanctions, to procure the Crowne for his Sonne, at what price did hee not purchase the Electors voyces? and with what inconuenience to the Empire, when he could not pay it, did he lease out the tributes of the Crowne? Those that held them, first receyuing them in the nature of a Morgage, afterwards, by the weakenesse or folly of the succeeding Princes, they turned them to their owne Inheritance. Besides, there are many things, workes, and intentions, which cannot, as soone as they are conceiued, profit the Common-wealth, but must haue maturity, and, like fruitfull Trees, in their due times yeeld Berries; vpon such counsels of long expectation, does the greatest safety of the Common-wealth vsually depend. Yet such purposes are often-times neglected and omitted by those Kings that rule not by Inheritance, but by Election: for, to begin those workes, labour and charge is required; and they are the more vnpleasing to the Founders, in that the flourishing, or at least, the Haruest of them they cannot so fully enioy, as afterwards the succeeding Kings may: and who shall these Kings be? their children, friends, or familiars? Perchance not; strangers, it may be, or their greatest enemies. Shall I, for these, lay a foundation of security, pleasure, and riches, with great care, and waste of my treasure, which I were better now bestow among my friends? But admit I would be at this charge, it may be, my enuious Successour would make these workes vnprofitable, and eyther neglect, or vtterly ruine what was charitably meant for long continuance; seeing it may seeme to me, and my Reigne, too much honour to haue beene the Founder; but to them onely to maintaine and keepe, what my wisdome inuented, will seeme a charge without glory. These things, with a feare that oft proues true, and to the ruine of the Common-wealth, doe oft deterre the mindes of such Kings from great and magnificent actions. But, howsoeuer, with lesse mischiefe to the Common-wealth, elected Kings may reigne, than they can at first be chosen. For in actiue Nations, swelling with a subtile, though fierce ambition, what hope is there of quiet Parliaments at such elections? Can they be free from bribery or open force, where many equall in wealth, birth, and courage, can neyther yeeld each to other, nor all reigne? But when the suffrages are diuided betweene two candidates; both clayming the Throne, and none knowing whose election is good; what troubles arise from hence? What long and bloudy warres haue hence ensued? Besides, I might here adde, that a people which is accustomed by Law to make their King, will oft presume vniustly to depose him; nor need I search old Histories. Behold Aqvilivs elected in two Diots into two Kingdomes; afterwards, by the reuolt of the same persons, lost them both; they say hee was not rightly inaugurated; so that now by warre, death, and desolation of his Land, he must seeke his owne again. Againe, Peranlylevs , at one side vsurping one of his Kingdomes; and Dereficvs the other: who in stead of doing his Office, in bringing meat to Aqvilivs his Table, had almost robb'd him both of Meat and Table. Thinke you not these the greatest of mischiefes? and worse than those which the infancy of our hereditary Kings doe sometimes suffer? I doe not deny, but that the infancy, folly, or sloth of a King, is preiudiciall oft-times to the Common-wealth, (for what among men was euer inuented, that was euery way beneficiall?) but they bring with them a milder tempest, than those which boyle out of the Sea of a troubled Parliament. Neither doe you thinke that the best, and fittest man to reigne, is alwayes chosen in those Parliaments. How many factions are there? that oft-times hee that in birth and power, is most eminent, in gifts of the minde is most defectiue: as if the Fates feared, that if on one man they should bestow the excellency both of minde and fortune, they should of a mortall, make him a god. He then that in those Parliaments is saluted King, shall not be the most worthy, but the most powerfull, or most fortunate; both which may want much to the art of gouerning: one by his power will eyther force or hyre the Electors voyces: and the other, by reason of his sloth, shall finde fauour of those, who hope themselues to reigne when hee is King. But to conclude, imagine the desires and purposes of the Electors so perfectly good, that in him whom they choose King, they seeke onely vertue, and wisely finde it; imagine besides, the modesty of the Candidates, an agreement of the people so perfect, that to a King so chosen, they would quietly yeeld their necks; imagine moreouer the innocency of the new elected King, among all the blandishments of his fresh fortune, to be still so mindefull of his owne state, that he neuer slip; then will I proclayme this the greatest happinesse, and thinke those Nations that enioy them, the most beloued of the gods. But these blessings cannot be hoped for; the vices of men, and so often experience to the contrary, doe otherwise perswade vs: and therefore without cause is the wisdome of those Nations condemned, that haue yeelded themselues to serue one lineage, to the end that their gouernements might be more quiet, and magnificent.  comes in disguise to see her.  fayle him; but lest they at the Table should take notice of it, he put off with iests (of which he was happily full) the grauiry of so serious a question; Evrymedes also helping, who was not pleased with the arguments of such dangerous Philosophy at his Table. The chiefe discourse among the Guests, was of Peranhil aevs , and Dereficvs , whose boldnesse against Countries, most men did loue to heare and discourse of. But Arsidas , among these discourses, the Banquet now almost ended, found a time easily to steale away to Argenis ; and briefly related to her, how violent wickednesse of the times, deliuered him a packet to carry to Poliarchvs , in which she had expressed her minde at large. And when she had greatly commended his ship, his voyage, and what-euer tended to the safety of so worthy a man out of the hands of his enemies, let the gods, and thine owne vertuous thoughts, be a reward sufficient; Poliarchvs , if euer hee be more fortunate, shall require thee: or if all fayle, from mee expect a sure reward for all thy goodnesse. Hee, much comforted with the words of to bee done, about euening he came to Timoclea's House. To whom, the Countrey-fellowes finding their mistake, were then by chance excusing their last dayes tumult. She, thinking more of her owne offence against the Lawes, than of their fortune in missing what they sought for, entertayned them courteously, preparing a better resolution in her selfe, if shee should againe bee put to the like plunge. Arsidas spoke kindely to them all; and when they were gone, at the beginning of the night, he descended to Poliarchvs. Poliarchvs almost sicke with griefe and delay, as soone as hee had spyed Arsidas comming; What newes, quoth hee, O Arsidas ? Shall I be buried here aliue? Deliuer mee from this darkenesse, though it be into the hands of mine enemies; I will no longer indure this imprisonment. Arsidas , well knowing how much ioy his Letters brought, makes no reply to his complaints, but deliuers him the Letter from Argenis , and bids him looke vpon the hand and Seale. she remember vs? He did not name her, because Timoclea heard their conference. And, vndoing the silke that the Letter was sealed with, he turnes aside, lest his lookes and gestures in the reading, should bee obserued. The Letter being read, he takes Arsidas aside to consult with him, if he might safely trust his disguized habit, and false hayre, and so goe to Argenis ; or follow the surer course, and ship himselfe to Messana . Arsidas was of opinion, that hee were best presently sayle to Messana . But within himselfe, her loue at length withstood that opinion: which when opinion, and perswades him first to goe to Argenis : for what is more easie, than the next day to goe into the Church, which is open to all? Where kisse, the most miserable Votaries are not forbidden. before day, they purpose to goe to take shipping for Italy , (for they concealed their intent of going to Court;) Poliarchvs tells her, that her louing intertainement shall neuer by him be forgotten; that his life, and what good soeuer that shall bring, shall be alwayes ready to doe her seruice. The Lady, with all prayers and vowes for his safety, melted into teares: for now, more like a Sonne than a Guest, hee was become the obiect of her greatest care: the benefit receyued, had added much to her affection: and she now feared, lest some more vngentle fortune might seize on Poliarchvs ; and thus weeping, shee left him to take his rest. The night being troublesomely spent betweene hope and feare, the Lady returnes with Arsidas into the Caue, bringing them sops in Wine, and inuited them, according to the Grecian fashion, to breake their fasts, their appetites being scarce yet awaked. A little before day, shee sent away Poliarchvs with Letters to Arsidas his wife: for Arsidas dwelt at Messana , being, by Meleanders trust, Gouernour of that City. The Contents of the Letter were, That she should haue in readinesse a good Ship at the Hauen, which hee must instantly vse into Italy ; that he must of necessity take a voyage to Rhegium , and to intreat her carefully to conceale the Bearer thereof; and that he himselfe, within foure dayes, would be at Messana . When he was gone, Poliarchvs alone followed, Arsidas riding softly before: hee was a-foot, in poore attyre, carrying a needlesse cudgell in his hand; dying also his hands with soot, lest their whitenesse should betray him.  Sacrifice. Argenis faigneth her selfe distract: she refuseth to sacrifice: her excuses; the King and the Court are hereat troubled.  opening the doores, had giuen power to all to visit the Shrine; and as yet the prease of people had not taken vp the best places to see. Poliarchvs took his seat as neere the Altar as he could. But Arsidas went to Argenis , and told her what a religious Votary stayed for her in the Church. The Princesse was astonished, strucken at once with a sense of suddaine ioy, and a feare of Poliarchvs his danger: and inquiring diligently by what tokens she might know him in his disguise; It is, quoth she, Arsidas , a businesse full of danger, if by  & by the King and Lycogenes , entring the Temple, Poliarchvs be conceal'd only by his disguise, and false haire. Will none, thinkest thou, of all the Nobles that stand about, find out this deceit; especially when all men are full of suspicion, both those that loue the King, and those that fauour Lycogenes , and will subtlely pry into all countenances, and whatsoeuer may hide treachery? I would rather haue him come hither to the Castle, but that I feare, the Warders may discouer and vnuayle his disguise. I will rather goe to my father, and tell him, that euer since he made me the Priest of Pallas , this Market-day was neuer denyed the meanest person to present their deuotion: and seeing that himselfe, together with Lycogenes , intends anon to come into the Temple, about ratifying the peace; the Church filled with their Guards and Attendants, will not be able to receiue the people, nor giue roome to the poore to doe their deuotion. Therefore, if it please him, (that we may nor breake an old custome) I will presently goe to the Altar; that as many of the Plebeians as will, may first performe their worship; and when the people haue done, he may the more conueniently vse what ceremonies of State are fitting. So, without feare, may I see Poliarchvs , and our plot lesse suspected among the dull-ey'd people. Arsidas applauding her inuention, and beseeching her to make haste, shee goes to the King: who, as well approuing her deuice, was happily deceyued with the slight: and shee hastening the solemnity, (for as yet being scarce the second houre, the religious people had not summon'd to the seruice of Pallas ) was brought to the Temple by her Guard and traine of women. Now, this was the order of those holy Rites, euer since Argenis had bin their Priest: the Sicilians did celebrate their faire dayes, both for administration of iustice, and Merchants trading. Then the Kings Edicts are published, and iudgement is giuen against offendors; this time beeing appoynted for holy exercises, and other publique solemnities. Then to the neighbouring Cities, come all the people from the Villages and Dorpes, to vent their Countrey commodities; and buy what the Cities yeelded. This day was dedicated to the seruice of Pallas ; that the people more frequently assembled, might see Argenis : who, to what part of Sicily soeuer she went, had in her traine the Prophets, and companies of Priests: the greater sacrifices, and other kinds of Oblations, did follow on the ninth day: if there were any Temple of Pallas neere, thither they carryed her Image for the people to doe their worship. If not, the most conuenient Temple was chosen, and that god or goddesse that there resided, was humbly intreated to leaue for a while their abode, and lend their roome to Pallas , since one Temple could not containe two deities. The doores, crowned with bayes, were beautified with lights and tapers: the Image of the goddesse that was worshipped before the Altar, was fierce, and becomming the armes she wore. Her bended brow, what with the sharpe cast of her eyes, and her helme couering halfe her forehead, did shew most beautifully terrible. Her lookes, though fierce, yet resembling a Virgin. She held a golden Speare, which the people oft thought the goddesse had shaken, being deceiued by the diuersity of rayes reflecting from the golds brightnesse. Vpon her Shield the Painter had figured Medvsaes head, expressing all the various colours of Serpents scales. She stood as if prepared for the combate; her left Legge so farre set out, that the whole Image stood a little at one side. At her feet, Erichtmevs , in a Serpents shape, twining himselfe about the lower end of her speare. But the chosen sacrifices with their garlands, and all other ceremonies, except the Wafer, they bring to the Temple doore to be slaine (for within the Temple it was vnlawfull to shead bloud:) when water was set vnder the sacrifice, Argenis came in glorious attyre, beseeming both a Princesse and a Priest. A long robe she wore, curiously wouen with various imagery, amongst which was figured the birth of Pallas out of Ivpiters braine; her inuenting the Oliue, and triumph ouer Neptvne . This being her traine, and wondrous long, lest it should sweepe the ground, was borne vp by sixe Virgins. Her hayre was bound with purple fillets, set with sprigs of Oliue-trees, and vpon the top of her head, they set a garland of Oliue branches. Thus attyred, and comming to the sacrifices, shee couers her head with a Vaile; and hauing said prayers proper to that seruice, and sprinkling the dedicated sacrifices with water and flower, with a womanish stroke shee hits their foreheads with her Siluer clubbe. But the Priests ready at hand, receyued the sacrifices with more cruell weapons, and cutting their throats, hoped in their entrayles to finde the Fates and decrees of the gods. Then Argenis entring the Temple, offered in a Siluer Censer, the vsuall Incense to the gods; who comming to the Altar, and taking the Crowne from off her owne head, shee humbly places it at the foot of the armed Image. Then, while the Frankincense and other Odours are sprinkled out of the Boxe, and heated with new fires, the Virgins that were neere, and as many of the people as were perfect in it, sung this following ditty:  Thou better part of Ivpiter , No Mother-goddesse dandeled: O Maide, for martiall studies bred, To these thy holy rites giue ayde. You Chorus of Sicilian Maides, Sound forth the valiant Virgins praise, And to it adde melodious layes. Mistris of warre, thy sterne Lawes deale To men, fate, strength, death, woe, and weale. A dart thy right hand; thy left hand holds Thy liuing foes turne Marble cold. Goddesse of peace, thou dost bestow Fat Oliues on the ground, and show The Spinsters vsefull Art to know, To those faire Virgins, that inuoke Thee with the Frankincense chaste smoke. Thy deity, the watry Mores, Inuoke, and Athens stately Towers. But thou this Ile vouchsafe to grace, And hither turne thy gentle face. To Sicily thy fauour send: Our long preserued Kings defend. When thou shalt proue so gracious, We wish, thou oft maist heare from vs Deserued praises for thine ayde. You Chorus of Sicilian Maides, Sound forth the valiant Virgins praise, And to it adde melodious layes. After that, followed all mens prayers; in which openly they prayed for the Kings safety; for wholesome weather, and a good season for the fruits of the earth: and in their priuate prayers, euery man begg'd happy successe to his owne family. Then, at the right hand of the Altar, Argenis sitting in an higher seat, held in her hand a wreathed bough, which bedewed with the bloud of the slaine Sacrifice, they sprinkled ouer with holy-water, thinking it a perswasion strong enough, if any man toucht it with his face. The armed Guard stood in two rankes, on each side of Argenis , leauing distance for two in a front to passe to her, lest the throng or inciuility of the rude multitude should any way trouble the Altar, or the Princesse. So, being admitted, they fall downe at her feet, and goe away blest, with a touch of her religious bough: the poorest were not denyed that fauour; but the sight of Argenis drew more to that deuotion than Pallas her selfe. That day therefore that Arsidas brought Poliarchvs , the sacrifices were prepared in the old Temple, which the men of Magella had dedicated to the Castle, pretending a desire to dismisse the people, before Meleander and Lycogenes should come, but indeed that shee might see Poliarchvs with lesse danger: and when she had touched the sacrifices, and left them at the Temple doore, in the hands of them that were to kill them; and in the entry had taken the censer in her hand; being euen now distracted in her thoughts, she came to the place, where Arsidas had told her, Poliarchvs would sir. Whom when she spyed in base attyre, and a borrowed countenance, fixing a lamentable eye vpon her, she was so fired, betweene piety and anger, that, halfe franticke, she had almost forgotten her deuotion: but, howsoeuer, shee went forward to the Altar; and looking toward the Image of the goddesse, whilest others sung their solemne Anthemes, shee, to her selfe, powres out her secret sorrowes: She appeales to the goodnesse of the gods, and with a silent exprobration puts them in minde, which knew before, of her vnspotted innocenc, and piety; that now was the time shee needed their helpe, if euer they would send it; if they regard or gouerne the affaires of mortals, why is there no reward for vertue? Why were they so cruell to her selfe,  & Poliarchvs , who neuer had prophaned them? They did well know how maidenly and vnspotted a loue she bare that worthy man; and could now wish, if the Lawes of Nature could make it so, that he were her owne Brother. At least, quoth she, helpe mee in this his flight; and if you haue decreed mischiefe to vs, let him goe free, and lay all vpon my head. From these prayers, though shee were feruent in them, a suddaine gust of thought carryed her away; sometimes bewayling her selfe, sometimes her deare Spouse; sometimes a most inexpiable hatred to Lycogenes possessed her; but as oft as she remembred her Fathers guilt, who was so easily drawne to consent to Poliarchvs his ruine; flying from those dangerous thoughts that might haue wronged her piety, shee turnes againe to the gods, and standing amazed, silently lamenting, her sorrowes pray more than her words prayed for her. But hauing her teares so farre in her power, her modesty thought that place vnfit for them; perchance the weight of her calamity being so great, that it could finde a way to teares. Neither did Poliarchvs feele lesse griefe and conflict in himselfe; he must now leaue the place that pleased him, and fly in the nature of a Traytor; how ill did this fortune agree eyther with his birth or minde? and whatsoeuer before had pleased him, did now torture his distracted brest. All the excellencies and vertues of Argenis came now into his minde; and what before he had a lesse esteeme of, being now to leaue, seemes greater in his thoughts. Among so many, nothing seem'd greater to him, than that he should be a cause of grieuing Argenis ; neither did lesse scare inuade his resisting thoughts, lest all the vowes of loue betweene him and the Princesse, might now by time and absence be forgotten; and that any thing which Argenis loued, should be hated by him; sometimes in anger, hee determined by Armes to inuade Sicily : but then againe he was afraid to hurt the Father or Countrey of or languishes. While his thoughts are thus at warre, the Anthems three times publiquely were sung, and the musicke ceased; when Argenis , not farre from the Altar, sate downe, holding out to all commers her sacred bough. Selenissa , and the choysest Virgins, stood behinde the place where shee sate: Evrymedes and Eristhenes , a payre of men farre different, stood at each side of her. From them, the souldiers reached to the doore of the Temple in two rankes, limiting the way to them that came to the Princesse. When distempers, whispering in her eare, he asked if any thing troubled her? The Princesse vsing the benefit of his speaking, tooke occasion, as oft as too much griefe oppressed her, to looke vpon Evrymedes . The people now wel-neere dismissed, Poliarchvs almost the last, remained to come to the consecrated bough. He wanted both strength and courage to step forward; being long expected by the cold and heartlesse Lady. Oh the mad deuices of Louers! they emboldened themselues to this short and silent meeting, as it were, to intercept a little flying ioy; now they repent that they haue tempted griefe and danger; and would much more haue bewailed their owne estates, if they might not so haue grieued. At length the poore man, now not in vaine vsing his staffe, steps forward toward Argenis , and falling downe vpon his knees, as if he said his prayers, Farewell, quoth he, most chaste Priest; remember, deare Virgin, thy Pallas goes from thee, still to be thine; and will returne (if thou wilt giue leaue) in her Fathers Thunder. Argenis vnderstood him, but durst not answere, only her sad eyes fixed vpon him, spake more powerfully then any tongue. But Poliarchvs was not able to arise from her feete; whether he had forgot himselfe in this cloud of misery; or was afraid his legges would faile him; and Selenissa began to feare, lest by this vnseasonable staying, he would marre all. Evrymedes , thinking the fellow in clownish simplicity had lyen still at her feete, gaue him on the side a good smart blow, with a Rod that hee had in his hand, but smiling withall at him. Poliarchvs was dearely loued by Evrymedes , and well knew, that stroke proceeded from no hatred; but from ignorance, by reason of his disguised habit; and presently he arose, euen in his owne iudgement worthily strooken. But Argenis could not be so content to see her Loue strooken, her modesty being scarce able to restraine from commanding departing Poliarchvs , as farre as she might, she fitly espied Arsidas at the Temple doore, to shew Poliarchvs , as she coniecture, dhis way to fly. For hee hauing gratulated to the King, that all was now in peace, pretended a necessity in himselfe to goe into Italy to his father in law: and hauing obtained leaue of the King, he went to the Temple of Pallas , where he saw Poliarchvs comming from the Altar: and stepping a little aside with him, he wils him goe by the backe gate out of the Towne, and keepe the way that leades to Messana , for two miles; and then hiding himselfe in the bushes, to stay; and he, when he had spoken with Argenis , would immediately follow. In the meane time Meleander sent to Argenis , willing her to hasten the solemnities of the popular Sacrifices; that the day was farre spent; and the Temple must bee left free for himselfe and Lycogenes . Shee was hardly her selfe, and by degrees yeelded to those perturbations, which shee thought her constancy had mastred. But she bade them tell the King, that all the Ceremonies belonging to the people, were now finished;  & that he might, when it pleased him, performe the Sacrifices he had appointed. A great traine, and fitting the magnificence both of Meleander and Lycogenes , staid at the Court Gate, waiting their setting forward. Lycogenes himselfe was in the Kings bed-chamber, vnder colour of waiting; holding diuers discourses, and sometimes merry ones with him. When it was time, Meleander in a kingly Robe and purple Cloke, holding his Scepter in his hand, went forth to his Guard. Next Before him went Lycogenes , euen to whose side, by the Kings command, went Archombrotvs ; before these, those whose offices or other greatnesse was eminent. The pompe was filled by a great number of gallant Youths of the chiefe Gentry. The prease of people could hardly bee kept out, eager of seeing, and then most, when most forbidden. Besides the high and long continued Title of a King, the reuerend age of mis-beseeming the height it bore, turned the eyes of all vpon him. Neither were onely his loyall Subiects moued with this sight, but euen those amongst his enemies, whose reuolt had rather beene rash then wicked. That dayes worke therefore the King needed not to repent; which made some ashamed, and others grieued, to see a King forced to such agreements. Shall then the King sweare to Lycogenes ? Will hee debase himselfe, to make a League with his Subiect? and that publikely? Shall the people bee witnesses, as to a lawfull action? What more could a forraigne Prince, euery way his equall, by a iust warre get from him? But those that had a deeper reach, and either through hope or feare more subtill; searched further in the busines; that this day was not to be honoured as a peace-bringer, worse things were yet behind: for that cannot be firme, which a King vpon compulsion couenants with a Subiect: for Princes doe often seeke by iniurious force, what was iniuriously forced from them. Either therefore, the King, when he sees his time, will be reuenged; or if hee fit still, suffer from Lycogenes . By chance an old man that had beene brought vp at Court, to a companion of his, that asked him if he had euer seene a countenance milder then the Kings? answered, so that the King heard him; I should thinke him more mild, fellow Souldier, if by this mildnesse he were not a tyrant to himselfe. When Meleander heard this speech spoken by an honest man, and being before troubled about those speeches, which he had heard Lycogenes the day before had vttered, dyning with Evrymedes , concerning the succession of Kings; stumbled so vpon a stone that stood a little higher then his fellows, that he stroke his hand against the ground. The suddaine outcry of those that saw it, made the feare generall. They that were neere to him, ranne to helpe the King; those that were further off, were more fearefull, by reason of their ignorance; vntill it was generally knowne that the fall was without hurt, and accidentall. The King himselfe with a iest put it off: that he was much beholding to that earth for honouring her King; who, because she could not rise to kisse her Soueraigne, had drawne him downe to her: adding, that hee willingly embraced that earth as his owne. But for all that, the standers by, as euery one stood affected to the King or Lycogenes , iudged of this, as a good or sad portent. For what could it portend, that the King should fall at Lycogenes his feete? that going to offer sacrifice, himselfe should fall like an Offering? How easily, how suddenly was he downe? While they are in these thoughts, the foremost of their traine were come to the Court of the Temple; where the Sacrifices crowned with garlands, and the Priests stood prepared, expecting till Argenis with the accustomed inuocations had besought the gods to be present at the offerings. But she now more and more vanquished by encroaching griefe; willing the rest a while to leaue her, in a secret corner of the Temple thus communes with her selfe: What art thou, wretched Argenis ? the cause of all that Worthies suffering? What hast thou seene? What mischiefes art thou reserued to? Poliarchvs banishment, Lycogenes his triumph? Canst thou suffer this, a Kings Heire, and borne to a Scepter? If thou remembrest thy selfe a Princesse, why keepest thou not thy Poliarchvs heere? If thou art his spouse, why is hee alone banished? But alas, this yet remained to make vp my misery, that I must be the Herauld to make peace betweene my Father and Lycogenes ; a peace, oh gods, which they haue sealed in Poliarchvs his danger, but thou, poore Argenis , with what face canst thou, I will not say, looke vpon into thy minde his vertues, lookes, or speeches? but duty to my Father, and the safety of the Kingdome vrge me to this deed. But wherein, alas, shall I sinne against my father, if I leaue vndone this fatall mischiefe? Or what haue I to doe with a Kingdome, if I resolue to dye? But the safety of a Kingdome does not alwayes consist in fearing; I may perchance restore by my boldnes, what my father has lost by his remissenesse. But what wilt thou doe? danger is now at hand, and will seize mee vnprepared. Behold, my Father and office in this damnable peace, what words shall I vse, what arguments in publike to my Father? This said; not now sad, but fill'd with a maiesticke rage, shee turnes her angry eyes vp and downe; when the last words of departing Poliarchvs came into her mind; he told her; Pallas went away still hers, and could returne with thunder. Yes certainely, quoth shee, my Temple is destitute of a goddesse. I know no better course, then to counterfeit a Prophesie, and that the goddesse forbids me to minister in these sacrifices: so shall I auoyde the mischiefe of making such a peace, and giue my thoughts more freedome for great determinations. When she had resolued on that way, as shee was of a most happy wit, and then vehement, she began to prepare such a speech as Prophetesses vse. Her countenance and eyes, since she had nourished that Fury which Poliarchvs his departure put into her, would well fit the deuice that she intended. While she thus thought, some came to her, and told her, she was expected to consecrate the Sacrifices: for the King was at hand, and by the Cryer had commanded silence. Argenis was now more cheerefull, as hauing fully resolued to rest in this determination. She answered therefore, that she would come, composing her pace and thoughts to her resolued Stratagem. And now the King and Lycogenes had the Sacrifice between them: and the Nobles about them, in agreeing silence, couered their disagreeing thoughts. The people flocking at euery side, enuironed them; and the appointed Soldiers could hardly make good sufficient roome for the Sacrifice. But Argenis being come to the Temple, lookt prodigiously, her eyes wandring, and her haire horridly hanging about her shoulders; she stamped vp and downe: her lookes shewed a distraction, which seemed in the first fit to striue against the motion of the gods, not firmely settled in her brest. the gods did so vexe his Daughter. But she rowling her eyes more terribly, began her speech, not in Meeter, (for she could not so suddenly compose it) but from the way of humane discourses, and like a diuine rapture; so that it was easie for Nicopompvs , not much changing the words, to put them into Verse.  Why flyest thou, sacred Maid, and leau'st this place? Gone is my Pallas , her auerted face, And flying Coach I see. Oh boldnesse dire! She, banisht, flyes: Why doe we feede thy fire With Frankincense, and to thine Altar slay Beasts? Oh take mee, and through the Cloudes away, Vnder what Starre so e're thou goe, me beare. Her armes, her armes shee threatning shakes; her speare Sounds on her golden Shield: the ayre yeelds feares, And through the Skie a bloody path appeares. Oh goddesse, spare thy threats, wreake not thine ire With vengefull steele, nor take thy Fathers fire. Oh whither tend the fates? What bootes vs build Their Temples, and their high-rais'd roofes to guild? If we shall dare doe this, by impious warre, The gods themselues from their owne Temples barre. When she had vttered many things in this Propheticke fury, falling to a lamentable shreiking, she resembled a true possest Prophetesse: and a strange amazement had settled all mens eyes vpon her: but Meleanders thoughts runne vpon that, that Oracle-wise was vttered by her; That Pallas by command was banisht, and departing, was full of threats; last, that a heinous offence was committed. The lesse he vnderstood these things, the more feare possest him. But Argenis , as if the strength of the spirit, which raging in her brest forced her to this Prophesie, were now spent, pulling her Priestly ornaments from off her head, came humbly to her Father, and entreated him that she might abstaine from this Sacrifice: for she was ashamed of that vnusuall rapture, and could not suddenly endure the peoples sight. The King, troubled with so many ominous accidents, pawseth a while, fearing, aboue all things, that Lycogenes should be iealous, that hee had purposely appointed these strange euents to disturbe the entended peace. her accustomed guard of Soldiers: and Arsidas , as of duty following, receiuing his commands to Poliarchvs , presently leaues the castle. A great noise and free murmur runnes presently through the people. Some say, this peace, by a most apparent manifestation of the goddesse, was disallowed; others referred this prodigy to the ensuing calamities of Sicily , and desire the Priests should go forward with the Sacrifices, and expiate the offence, what ere it be. Those whose iudgement was least asked, were most forward in spending it. But the voice that was most heard, was of those that called for an Herauld. For as the Sicilians , from their first originall, had been nurtured in the Greekish customes, so the neerenesse of Italy had brought in to them many Italian Rites, among which was the Religion of the Heraulds. Meleander therefore, to appease all differences of opinions; There is no difference, quoth he, whether those agreements that are made sincerely betweene honest men, be ratified by the authority of Pallas or lawfull Rites. The Herauld in his purple robe, rehearses a long prayer, contayning many curses against Truce-breakers. The Sacrifice then being slaine; the King and touching the Altar and bed where the Image was, they againe sealed their faith before the gods. These things being finished, the whole traine turne to the Palace. But no applause of the people followed them; neither were the lookes of friends gratulating each other, sincere. The King, as then beseemed, dissembling the griefe of his minde, and counterfeiting all tokens of mirth, made a publike Feast the same day, and the next day saw Playes; in which the Poet was comicall, and broke iests vpon the people; And he did not like, that Kingly and tragicke Poems should be then set forth For many dayes, friends on both sides, being warned by Meleander and Lycogenes , not only refrained from all quarrels, but feasting each other, made good their dissimulation of ioy and security. And Argenis also, who had kept her Chamber vnder colour of sicknesse, shewed her selfe now openly, after arriued vpon the Coast of Italy . The end of the first Booke. BARCLAY HIS ARGENIS: OR , The loues of Poliarque and Argenis . The Second Booke .  The retreate of the King into Eipercte : the description of the place. The treason of Selenissa against Timoclea .  driuing of Poliarchvs out of Sicily : because, beeing a stout Youth, and of solid iudgement, hee had much aduantaged the Kings part by the greatnesse of his spirit, and he being dead, or at least absent, their factious plots might be more facilitated. For the report of his death did not long stand currant; but whether it was onely suspected, or by some that knew it, reuealed, it was not obscurely blazed abroad, that Arsidas had giuen him his safety by shipping. And this did Lycogenes first lay to the Kings charge, bruiting among the people, by men suborned to that purpose; that his faith: for by his command, his Ambassadours were slaine by Poliarchvs , and the offender secretly deliuered from punishment, was not safe in Italy , like enough, perhaps, to make ready himselfe for the like villany. dishonour. For matter was sought for new tumults; neither wanted there some to carry tales of these new stirres to Meleander . He of purpose did perseuer in his first shew of mildnesse, that the same apparence of negligence, which had before wronged his affaires, might now deceiue his enemies. His resolution was more fired, then by the villany of Lycogenes , and the danger of his estate, with the manly constancy of Argenis : to whom when hee complained, that she had left the Sacrifice, and giuen way to suspition, that some tricke was sought, whereby the league might be broken off; she replies, If any thing bee offended, you should iustlier complaine of the gods, whose violence, Sir, I was neither able to refuse nor contayne. But there are moe that wonder, you should make such a peace, than that I and the gods fled from it. Pardon the libertie which your goodnesse giues mee. It were better, perhaps, rather to dye once in some braue action, then basely suffering vnder so many iniuries, to raigne of courtesie. The King, neerely touched with her more then womanly apprehension, now determined to put his long thought of purpose of seuerity in practice; to which purpose Eipercte did offer: it selfe, a fit place to dwell in, either for fight or flight; whither he had, vnder other pretext, conueyed all things meete to serue for both fortunes. Eipercte is a Mountaine on the borders of Panorma , some few miles round: from the foot it riseth a little with craggy and broken rockes: after, where the Hill growes bigger, through his inaccessible paths, by little and little it bendeth to a more easie passage, till you come to the toppe, to a faire plaine, wherein also a little Mount is fitly placed, as if made by Nature for a Castle. This Mount had the Kings fortified with munition: the rest of the top hath a Towne, with many and pleasant houses about it. On that side of the Mountaine which lookes towards the Sea, the Hauen, capable of all kinde of shipping, comes in betweene the Rockes, of a spacious breadth, high water, and by the embraces of the mountaine, free from stormes. The Towne doth so conueniently ouerlooke this Port, that without leaue of the Inhabitants, neither can any ship come in, nor any streight passage bee kept, leading from the Sea to the hill. And where the mountaine lookes to land-ward of the Ile, it could then onely be ascended by two paths, and those alike difficult for passage. A great comfort also it is to the Eiperctans , that about all their houses, they haue plentifull foode for their cattell. And that they should acknowledge this to bee the meere gift of the gods, the many springs and wholsome ayre, was the cause that no venemous creature did liue there. In the entrance of the way which ascended from the Hauen, the Image of Ceres , with a Crowne of wheaten eares, and a nimble yoke of Serpents, put those that entred in minde of their deuotions, that they should not goe forward without worship to the goddesse, nor neglect the stone, which in old Charracters signified her thus to speake:  If through all circuits where crook't Nereus flow, To me all grounds their fruit, all Countries owe Their peacefull Lawes, if safe by my command From theeues all fruites in woods and fields doe stand: This my deserued praise all Nations sound, Let mee liue safe, and honour'd on this ground. Let no proud foe this Coast depopulate: This is my seat, my Land bestow'd by Fate. This pleases me: nought but the plow-share wound The fertile Earth: no other Armes here sound. This is my iust request. Who ere dare try, Will finde of mee too strong an enemy. I can bring fire, and weapons: and to mine, My cousin Nature all her powers shall ioyne. Old Satvrn's Childe I am, by Iove a Mother, My Sonne-in-law rules Hell; the Sea, my Brother. beauty of the place, and also vnder colour of hunting, whereof the neighbouring parts had good choyce. The trustiest of his Souldiers were there in garrison,  & if, in case Fortune should be auerse from his affaires, he were forced to flye, he had vnder other pretexts brought in part of his owne Gallies to the Hauen. Also, at fit times taken, whatsoeuer the former Kings had gathered, was brought to this Castle: Great abundance of Iewels, many boughes of Corall, which they had gotten out of the next Sea; Outlandish purple, many ages kept, neuer changing the colour of the naturall dye; Plate of Gold and Siluer; some shining through the new burnishing: moe, dimmer; but more esteemed for their antiquity. There was no great store of Coyne, the Treasure being drayned by the Kings liberality, which yet now the consideration of what was to come, had well lessened. The King acquainted Argenis onely with his purpose; that hee was resolued to vindicate the Regall dignity: If Lycogenes and the chiefe of the Confederates, vnder colour of seuerall occasions, might be wonne into the Castle (for now they were much dispersed) hee would lay vpon them all, both iudgement and punishment. To this designe, Eipercte was fittest; from whence both the neighbour Region might be kept in, and the Sea in his power. Perhaps, said he, this quicke change will tame the rest, that offend on confidence of my mercy. But if the warre shall grow more dangerous, and the successe shall not answer our hope, I will leaue this most ingratefull soyle, and shipping my treasure, will saile with thee into Africa . Neyther doe there want some there, that will receiue vs in our flight: and eyther I so old, or thou so young, so vnworthy of calamity, shall appease Fortune. If this misery shall happen, I will giue charge onely of Eipercte to Evrymedes , which hee with a choyce Army shall defend to the last. In the meane time, Daughter, Sicily shall suffer for our wrongs, being distracted with the grieuous dissentions amongst the Rebels themselues: and the Commons, finding their errour, shall most heauily waigh, what the Traytors may bee, and what wee were vnto them. For, neyther will they agree in diuiding the rewards of their Treason, nor will all subiect themselues to Lycogenes . For, many of them desire, that I should be ouercome, not ouerthrowne. So, falling out amongst themselues, part will looke towards vs: and peraduenture our returne will be their benefit, by whose wickednesse wee were forced to flye. Meane while, goe thou, Argenis , to the Castle: for, I feare, we shall be sodainely forced to giue or take a battell. This one thing see to, that you admit no women, but of tryed fidelity, into your familiarity. It is enough, my Daughter, that wee are betrayed by men. To this, Argenis , gratulating to her Father this magnanimous resolution, and perswading him to try his Fortune in a new warre, added, that she had hitherto gently prouided, that no women of vnknowne disposition should bee acquainted with her. But after they were parted, she began deepely to thinke, of what woman the King wished her to take heed, or who at all it was, that liued with her, so hatefull to him. She straight acquaints Selenissa , not knowing, that she, hating Timoclea , had by secret meanes, cunningly made her suspected of the King. And now that crafty old Woman, though glad that her practice wrought so well, most treacherously seemed to Argenis , to wonder who it should be had put these cares in Meleanders head. But the cause, why she thus closely plotted against Timoclea , was this: Shee found goe all old acquaintance. Therefore, terribly vexed with enuy, shee turnes her selfe to the wickednesse and hatred, familiar in Courts; yet openly shee speaketh nothing against her: for, both the plot and the businesse had fayled, if Argenis had conceited the depth of her fraud. And she knew further, shee should be a farre heauier enemy to the Lady, if she were not perceiued to hate her. To this end she suggested many reasons, by which shee would proue it best, that Argenis should eyther omit the doing her good, or at least deferre it: Will you, said she, haue Timoclea know, that these are the rewards for concealing Poliarchvs ? Would you, that the secret pledges of faith betweene you and him, should be discouered to more? You shall certainely doe wiselier, if you shall, as of your owne disposition, shew her some indifferent fauour, that she may conceiue the benefit of your owne free gift, not her deseruing. But let her keepe home: her admission into your Family would not want suspition. For, suppose (which the gods grant) that the people shall neuer come to that dangerous knowledge of Poliarchvs his being by her preserued; yet what of this new Guest Archombrotvs ? He knowes, how much she hath deserued of him: and will not hee finde, that such rewards so suddenly bestowed, chiefly by you, were for such a seruice? By these and many other arguments, Selenissa did more truely prouide for her owne safety, then her Ladies; fearing her owne fall from that height of fauour wherein shee now stood, if once there were any other, beside her selfe, to whom all the secrets should be communicated. But she did it so neatly, and with such slights, as she seemed onely to respect Argenis . A dayly and deadly ill hap of Princes, vnder whom their Fauourites, by colour of helping and counselling, satiate their owne enuy, and sometimes doe prayse their opposites, that they may find the readier beliefe, when theselues suggest falshoods. And therefore Selenissa had priuately guilded those pills of suspition, which shee gaue the King against Timoclea : That heretofore she had fauoured Lycogenes , and it was not knowne how shee stood affected, yet the innocent Argenis loued her. Againe, to Argenis her selfe, shee did euer mingle the Matrons prayses and merits, with the image of the danger that seemed worthy to be feared in the raysing her. And because she told truth in part, it came to passe, that Timoclea was scarcely any thing the better for Argenis , sauing that somtimes she would giue her good countenance, as she had euer vsed at her comming to her, and giue her somewhat at her parting, as willing to take any occasion to shew her bounty.   And not long after, Meleander , as hee was going towards the same Towne, was in great hazard of his life, whether by the treachery of his owne people, or by the will of the Fates, seeking grace and fauour to Archombrotvs . There was a Lake not aboue a mile about; whose bankes were pleasant and easie, but further onward the water very deepe, and the ground vnfirme. Thither the Kings Coach-man did driue, as leading the fairest way. The frequency of Chariots which daily were driuen that way, being easie to be marked by many tracts, tooke away all feare; when, lo, the Kings Horses, whether of themselues affrighted, or chased with the stinging of the Marish Gnats, or lastly, by treason of the Coach-man, with their maynes high shaking and dangerously flinging, run directly head-long into the Lake, all in the company with a most fearefull out-cry shreeking and lamenting: but few laboured to helpe, whether through vntimely feare euery man look't to himselfe, or that the terriblenesse of the sudden danger appalled their dull spirits. Amongst those who loyally followed the ouer-swift Coach, none could keepe pace with Horses more strongly: sometimes to the King, to leape into the water, being not yet full a mans heighth. Meane-while, the Coach goes on, and the foremost wheeles were now couered with water. But then Archombrotvs vndertooke a most manly act, and because his horse, hindred by the waues, could not make way, leapt in on foote. So, hasting to the side of the coach, he did so opportunely take out the willing Meleander , by catching hold of his Clothes behinde, as almost in the same instant the water falling with a sudden Source, swallowed vp both Coach and Horses. The Kings weight falling vpon him out of the Coach, had almost sunke Archombrotvs , partly by reason of the slippery bottome which was of tough clay, and the vnstable motion of the water, which came vp to his shoulder. Neyther did the King take lesse labour to get firme footing. Thus each, as if they were wrestling, stucke close to other, till, (comming neerer Land) some speedy friends deliuered them from the ouer-whelming water. As soone as Meleander stept on the shore, both hee and his, did most fearefully apprehend the greatnesse of the danger escaped: and which especially increased the terror of it, that seeing hee could not swim, he must needs haue beene drowned, but that Archombrotvs , neglecting his owne safety, tooke the whole danger vpon himselfe: who, when it was found, that hee likewise could not swim, they were all strucke into more admiration, that hee, a stranger, bound by no benefit, nor Law, should in the Kings danger so slight himselfe; when ( o shame!) so many his owne Countrey-men and Subiects, stood still and carelesse. Chiefly this seruice did, as it ought, much affect the King. Hee greedily imbraced him, and held him, blushing to heare his owne prayses: and being before this, forced to loue him for his great worth, hee was glad that by this chance hee had the meanes giuen him to take him into his priuate familiarity, without the enuy of others. In the meane time, the Kings Coach-man hauing escaped the waters, with a frightfull countenance made to the banke, when Eristhenes , hauing long before vsed rayling words at him, drew his sword, and, as with a minde to reuenge the Kings danger, gaue a sudden thrust, vnawares to the rest. Thus, wounded, hee fell backe into the water, with the great applause of the Youth there present. But this pleased not those of deeper iudgement: For, if it happened not by the Coach-mans fault, why should the poore man bee thus murdered? But if hee were guilty, why then was hee vpon no tryall had, none of his Complices discouered, nor by so easie a death freed from due punishment? Did Eristhenes onely loue the King, that hee made himselfe so hasty a Minister of reuenge? So they fell to suspect, that the Coachman was hyred by some of Lycogenes his faction, to haue taken the Kings life by this deuice, which when it fayled, lest he might be forced to discouer the Conspiracy, he was slaine by Eristhenes , a great friend of Lycogenes . But Eristhenes his greatnesse, and the time not yet ripe for reuenge, forced Meleander (though vnwilling) to dissemble; and that with a look so calme, as Eristhenes could not perceiue himselfe suspected.  The King holdeth a secret Councell: The aduice of Cleobvlvs. Archombrotvs proposeth the calling backe of Poliarchvs . The resolution of the Councell.  to giue thankes to the gods for the Kings safety, Meleander hiding his purposes, and forcing himselfe, to all manner of mirth. The chiefe friends of eminent degrees of power. For, Meleander had trusted Eristhenes with treasure, being assured hee had conferred so much strength vpon his enemy: but so the times, and the double visage he had now put on, would haue it. Olo odemvs had the gouernment of all the Country adiacent to the Promontory Pachynus . These, diuiding the managing of the businesse betweene them, tooke seuerall courses. Olo odemvs was absent from the Court with his Office, was present at the Kings Councels. In these three, it was knowne, the chiefe power of the Conspirators did consist. The King, though now settled in resolution, yet desired to know Cleobvlvs his opinion: he also much vsed the aduice of these three together priuatly, and Argenis being with him, in such manner spoke at first to them, as he might not shew his owne minde, lest, after such preiudice, they would hardly vse free liberty of speech, fearing to deliuer their opinion contrary to the Kings, or beleeuing they should disswade in vaine. He shewed, in what state Sicily now stood: That this peace was more incommodious, than the former warre: That hauing ere-while fore-seene this, he had fortified Eipercte : that he knew, the strength of this fearefull Rebellion depended but vpon few heads. None of them, in so great affaires, durst offer to speake first, till the King, in reuerence of his age,  & approued wisdome, commanded Cleobvlvs to begin. We must, said he, goe strongly about it, O King, or expect speedy ruine, as it were, offering our owne heads. A meane courage in you, will be held a vice: neyther doe you wrong either your owne fame, or the gods, in reuenging your selfe vpon these enemies. For, Lycogenes himself first broke the league; and by his punishment, they which contemne or hate you, will be changed. We know that diuers cities are sollicited, that their companies are almost vnder their colours. Why doe you delay, till there be no sound part left of Sicily ? Are you in feare to breake off their yet vnripe preparations? or doe you piously expect, till you be commanded to betake you to the sword? Eristhenes you haue here. Call Olo odemvs & Lycogenes , as it were to Councel vpon some sudden accident. If they come, let them be presently condemned of treason, and cut off: but if they refuse, pursue them as Rebels, while yet they are too weake, with an open and speedy war. To these words of Cleobvlvs, Evrimides added, that he would vndertake for 6000. foot,  & 500\. horse, to be alwaies both loyal & ready; some of the of the Pr aetorians ; some of them in the garrison of Eipercte ; others, seuerally quartered at Panormus , and the Castle of Epipolis . Such a small company of old souldiers, will be able to make their party good against all the fresh troups Lycogenes can raise. And where the Standard-royall shall be aduanced, no doubt, but many will offer themselues to the better side. During this consultation, Archombrotvs , grown merrier vpon the mention of warre, and conceiuing he had new opportunity to aduenture somewhat for to question the maine of your affaires. But if you agree vpon warre, why doe you reiect your owne aides? Why doe you weaken your owne strength before the danger? There is as yet not one of the souldiers that would not wish his very name formidable to his enemies: Know ye further, that at his returne, and at his sight, as a presage of safety, the whole Army would be more ready for any attempt. Certainely I hold it meet, he should be sought out, and (the necessity of the times excused, that droue him hence) to inuite him backe againe to a new victory. this, that the King did so attentiuely hearken to him: And that none might disturbe these auspicious and likely beginnings; she added, that Arsidas was in the same case with Poliarchvs , whom all men giue out to houer in Italy , as banished from his owne Countrey: and yet, that he cannot be charged with any thing, but the conueying away of Poliarchvs : Of perhaps deserued better of vs, than of Poliarchvs . But grant, that he hath offended, I beg the disposing of him, though as long as Poliarchvs shall be reputed condemned; or odious, he cannot be acquitted. Argenis being thus earnest in defence of Arsidas , because it had relation to Poliarchvs his safety, all the rest, to please her, were ambitious to shew themselues of her opinion. That the gods, said the King, haue a care of our estate, euen by this I perceiue it, in that with wonderfull consent in opinion, you haue all perswaded mee to that, which I had before determined. Decreed therefore (with the fauour of the gods) be the warre against Lycogenes ; if he cannot be taken without tumult, and cut off without due punishment of Traytors. rests to aduise, by what meanes we may win them both back againe. They were all of opinion, to send some one of approued trust with presents to against Lycogenes , he would returne to Sicily . Vpon this resolution, the King broke vp the Councell, charging them all to keep close, whatsoeuer they knew, or thought. But Argenis , after the manner of Louers, alwaies immoderately reioycing, or pensiue, did now visibly enioy her mirth so hapning beyond hope. And her father ignorant of the cause, told her, I imbrace, daughter, this presage of good fortune; That from the beginning of these miseries which are falne vpon vs, this is the first time I haue seene you merry, or of a cheerefull countenance.  the people.  Kings garden. There, as he was walking alone, among the rankes of Trees, hee fell into remembrance of that night, when Poliarchvs and he were guests at presently, with the weight of insuing thoughts, he forgets it; and so much the easlier, because he did not imagine it mutuall loue, but rather a youthfull madnesse in Poliarchvs . But then he began more strictly to re-collect all the passages in his memory; That Poliarchvs twice started at the name of answered onely by pieces, so as you might note him at that name to be much vnsettled. As he was dwelling vpon the remembrance of this, Argenis comes into his mind, who, as she was defending Arsidas to her father, seemed betweene her arguments and requests, to be all on fire. But what Arsidas had done, concerned onely Poliarchvs his safety. Archombrotvs hauing weighed these things on both sides enters now into suspition of some closer league of friendship betweene them. Poliarchvs his vertues, and whatsoeuer else might raise such a hope in him, or moue Argenis for him, did now freshly assault his memory. Certainly, that he concealed his birth, was a signe, there might be some notable mystery: neyther am I alone, said he, whose birth or fortune ought to be valued according to my disguise. But while hee thus calls to fresh memory the beauty and greatnesse of and with a silent gratulation repeats Poliarchvs happy in her loue, he now begins to admire, as well as prayse, those things in her, which hee had before beheld vntouched. For, what could be thought more excellent than Argenis ? Who had euer attained to such good qualities, so great parents, so many vertues? If she had no prerogatiue of birth, but choyce were to be made amongst all the Virgins, none before Argenis should be called to be Queen. Her wisdome, her modesty, her language did excell all of her Sex: and her forme more than mortall. After this, Archombrotvs commes to thinking of himselfe; neyther did hee coniecture his owne birth vnworthy of so great hopes; a ready fewell (no doubt) to his new fires: and this, at first, not as thinking to loue, but as hauing in his head some idle, yet not vnlikely fancies. By little and little he was caught, and with a kinde of doubtfull pleasure held close to these Chimerae's ; not knowing, that if he would conquer and be free, he had need of all his fortitude against these first motions of loue: The dearer he held Argenis , abated so much of the friendship, which had bound him to Poliarchvs ; first, assaulted by Enuy; next by Iealousie. So he goes out of the garden loue-sicke, and captiue, that a little before entred free and happy. It was an addition to his misery, to asswage this tempest by solitarinesse; hee supped alone: For, when in silence and solitude, nothing but loue presented it selfe to his thoughts, he yeelded himselfe to those cares, which within few dayes did exceedingly torment the young Louer, with neuer till now experienced maladies. While these things are thus carryed about the King, Lycogenes with his Confederates, take no lesse care for the maturing of their enterprise. Making himselfe businesse to the principal Townes; vnder seuerall pretences, he aduises the Magistrates (being first merry with Wine and banquetting) that they suffer not the publique liberty to be betrayed: That Sicily was infested with bad Councels: that they should remember they liued in a kingly, not in a tyrannicall State: neyther did he adde any thing against the King, but so couertly, as he might be able to excuse it, euen to Meleander himselfe. But when he perceiued them nettled at these words, hee would with sighs speake something by halues to them in publique, and to the principall men whisper in their eare, that it might be thought, he out of his pious care did feare more, than he durst vtter. Then would many of them cast their eyes vpon him, as the Pillar of his Countrey, and with a dumpish carefulnesse despise Meleander : especially, when it was noysed among the people, that the Natiues being neglected, Strangers were called in to the managing of publique affaires; that the taxes and customes were daily inhansed: and lastly, that ruine and destruction hung ouer their heads, from the King, being incensed with the former warres. Besides these slights, there were some Priests, that for bribes stood him in no small stead. They turned all into Religion, by false prophesies and fained auguries. Whether publikely or priuatly the offering were slaine, the beholders were terrified with fained prodigies; sometimes the liuer wanted a head; sometimes the inwards, against Natures course, appeared out of their owne place: and alwaies, that new fortunes, and those better than the former, were portended: but that nothing, which then was done, did please the gods. Besides these cunning impostures, there happened some prodigies not false nor fained, by which the neere-following miseries were affirmed: For it both rayned stones from heauen, and else-where two Sunnes shined together. But these few true signes gaue credit to infinit fayned ones; so as men did both rashly beleeue all things, and feare them: Which state of the wretched people, a certaine Poet, himselfe not free from the generall madnesse, did thus describe:  Forbeare, you gods, the well-ioyn'd frame t'vndo Of things, and th'Earth with prodigies one-throw: Heau'ns frame is chang'd. In th'Aire's affrighted face Hobgoblins flye, and enuious Comets blaze. Lost in the Winters cold, the Springs rich pride; The Dog-starre layes his wonted heat aside. So in the World's first infancy the Sunne, Yet young, his course through th'vnknowne heau'ns did run. Oft skillesse of his charge, oft did hee erre The wayes vnknowne, and so confound the yeare. Behold, how blacke a Cloud to darke the sky Fire-breathing Ætna lifts: the Sea swoln high, The South-winde rolls a-shore on Sicily . Such was the feare, when once the Seas rough hand Dis-ioyn'd this Hand from th' Italian Land. Great are the gods portents, but greater farre Our inward feares. All men mis-giuers are. Death, Warre, and future Ruine all fore-see. Whether in vs this madnesse natiue be, Or from the gods, why thus prolong doe wee Our paine? To armes, the cruell deities T'appease, with a deseruing sacrifice. Let bloud our sacrificing weapons staine, To glut the gods, and life by death obtaine.  A discourse of the Sects of the Hyperephanians : and the errours of  consultation with the Hyperephanians : and some did feare, that to make vse of their power, he would turne Apostate to his old Religion. It ch anced, that as this was reported, Archombrotvs and Ibvrranes , with whom, after some acquaintance, but chiefly by the Kings commendation, hee now begun to grow familiar. They were both walking in the great gallery: and heard the Hyperephanians talked of, asked, What difference there was between these and the other inhabitants of Sicily ? Why their names, their affections, their strengths did so much differ? Then Ibvrranes , a little collecting himselfe, that hee might the better informe him, thus began: We haue giuen this name to the Hyperephanians out of the nature of their owne superstion: Their Sect, dangerous to Princes, had its beginning lately from one which flourished heere in Sicily , presumed to bring in new religions, and to enueigle the peace of such consciences as were to be swayed by pride, or too much simplicity. Some thought it a braue thing, after the Leader, to fall from the opinion of their Ancestors: others his eloquence deceiued, mixt with the shew of piety. To this may be added the force of nouelty, with so great madnesse blinding mens minds, that the barbarous assertions of Vsinvlca found commenders, not from the vast  & remote parts of the earth, but (which would strike you into amazement) out of the bowels of Sicily ; though there bee nothing more detestable, then those strange fopperies, wherewith he hath defiled his schoole; so as I am ashamed to relate his outragious madnesse, so contumelious to the gods. He denyes that any mortall can goe about any sinne, saue onely such as is forced by the gods to commit the same. And how soeuer you striue against vice, be in your selfe innocent, kinde to your neighbours, religious to the gods; yet all this piety shall not make you a iot better loued of the gods. For, all these are not that vertue, which makes men acceptable to the immortall powers, but onely signes of that vertue. Further, that there are no differences in offences, but in the men which offend: As for example, Those that are hated of the gods, for stealing of a Pot-hearbe, deserue whatsoeuer the furies are said by the Poets to inflict: others againe, shall not lose the fauour of the gods, by parricide, nor incest. So, from the same puddle of wickednesse, shall some goe out cleane, others polluted. As if you thrust a Goose or Swanne into the water, you may take them out perfectly dry: where other birds, in the same waters, and often with lesse stay there, hurt the order and vse of their wings. I forbeare to speake of Vsinvlca's other foolery. Neither had these monstrous positions disciples of long continuance, if they had not falne in the infancy of Kings; in which times, being most commonly full of troubles, things exorbitant can hardly be corrected, or expelled. The fiercenesse of factions augmented this disease; and some of the chiefe Nobility, through hatred to those which managed the affaires vnder the Infant Kings, made themselues Leaders to these seditious Hyperephanians . And then vnder a most fatall starre, intestine broyles ouer-ranne Sicily : and as many as loued the licence of Sedition, reuolted to the Hyperephanians , daring to display their Colours euen against our Kings themselues. Nothing escaped their fury. They trampled on the Altars of the gods, ouer-threw Temples, fired houses,  & with their owne Countrey-mens blood, consecrated their Nouelties to the Furies. After so many yeeres, you may yet see, as it were, maymed Cities, the Tabernacles of the gods cut downe, vpon which they vsed most cruelty. In these vprores, they departed with so great a diuorce from the rest of the Sicilians , that they seemed, as it were, another Countrey, and another people; neither vpon any the strongest league that could be made, would they returne sincerely to the society of the rest of the Nation: so by the impulsion of their natures louing discord, they must alwayes either threaten or feare warre. In mindes so affected, what free command, thinke you, can Kings haue ouer them? They haue possessed themselues of Cities, Souldiers, and almost whole Prouinces; out of which, with a proud scorne, they debate how farre it is fit, the King should be aided or neglected. To whom, either in his warres, or vpon any other occasion, if they promise any aide, they bragge of their fidelity, as being worthy of thankes; forgetting, that good Subiects should not exact such security; neither would they so often seeke it, if it were at any time safe. But they giue their aydes, and obey or refuse the Kings commands, more like fellowes, then Subiects. So they make themselues Iudges of the gods, and of their Princes; and measure what duety they owe to either, not by Religion, but according to their owne dispositions. What miseries this infection threatens to Sicily , you may of your selfe imagine. For as the hatred is most deadly, which is heated with controuersies between seuerall religions; we may iustly feare, lest these Hyperephanians will seeke what they cannot atchieue of themselues, by the ruine of their Countrey, by calling in strangers and enemies, not so much to the warre, as to the prey,  & in a maner to the possession of Sicily . But if it shall please the more fauourable gods to auert these miseries from vs; yet notwithstanding, how horrible are those, which wee now see and feele? If children be angry with their parents, or the Nobles with their King, presently, vnder pretence of Religion, they haue recourse to this Sect, as to a kind of most certaine enfranchisement; though well knowing, they doe most hurt to themselues: but they respect not that, so they may vexe their opposites by their errour. What shall I say of the Vestals? What of the priests of the gods? When they are weary of their chastity, they doe, without punishment, rayle at religion; and to buy the enioying of their incestuous marriages, giue vp themselues to the Hyperephanians . By these examples, and that licence of disputing and liuing, the Common-wealth is made so wauering, as first they doubt what gods there are to be worshipped, and in what manner: and shortly after, vpon a rude and impious pride and loathing, hold nothing at all holy, nor any certainety of the deities. So as by this wickednesse, there is a calamity falne euen vpon the gods owne affaires, and withall creepes into the generall peace, weakening the powers of sickly Sicily ; which will neuer recouer her former health, vntill this wound, by the reclaiming the Hyperephanians to more wholsome courses, shall cloze his scarre. Then, said Archombrotvs , why are the Sicilians so slow to quench this flame at once? or why doe they sticke to cut out this poyson, spreading it selfe with such deadly infection? Euen I, that am a Stranger, doe promise my hand and sword in this action. Neither shall I euer thinke to offer more acceptable Sacrifice, than if I shall giue their bloods to the gods, or lose mine vpon their swords. It had beene fit, Ibvrranes , that you should tell the King this, and vrge him to this warre. Ibvrranes smiled, and said, I commend your eagernesse thus heated with youthfull feruour. So heretofore many were of the same minde, till by the successe it was found, that as certaine liuing creatures are nourished with poyson; so this sect growes stronger by publike miseries, and is fattened with warre and desolation. That you may therefore haue milder thoughts, heare me, Archombrotvs , in briefe: Many of lightnesse fauour Vsinvlca , who, when they are with the sword and threates commanded to leaue his opinions, they fauour his sect more heartily, as out of piety: and after, with a concealed desire of holding what positions they will, and of offending against the publike Lawes, they adhere more stubbornly to this faction. So they doe now truely drinke in this superstition, through indignation and heate of faction, which without forcing, they would either haue neglected out of carelesnesse, or vpon more temperate consideration would vtterly haue damned it. And so as you may easily breake little threads, alone and vntwisted; but if you twist them together the more you pull at them, the stronger they be, and grow to be a rope, which you shall neuer be able to breake: so these, being of themselues more negligent of their faction, and such as by delay wee may easily winne, when they shall see swords set to their throates, to draw from them a forced (that is, as they esteeme it, a shameful) penitence, they furiously ioyne to their fellowes, and in a knot of conspiracy gather a publike strength, such as you shall hardly ouerthrow. For now the Maladie is dispersed further, than that all the offenders can be made guilty, or summoned by the Lictor. And further, this Nation of the Hyperephanians , doth not (like others better disposed) seeke to be augmented by suffering or obeying; but, being easily drawne to vprore, is accustomed to auow their mischiefes with none of the worst blood. And Sicily is full of young people, whom sometimes leuity, sometimes want, sometimes desire of action so stirreth vp, as not regarding law nor shame, they will increase the number of the factious, and enter into a warre, though neuer so odious to gods and men: So, in time of warre, many in hope of pillage, come to the Hyperephanians , which in peace would curse them; and Kings, by offering warre, make guilty more new ones, than cut off old ones. Must then (said Archombrotvs ) this plague of the Kingdome bee suffered, and we stand at gaze, till by this spreading poyson all the members perish? At the worst, there is nothing more heauily to be feared in any cure, be it neuer so dangerous, then such a deadly delay. There be, said Ibvrranes , other meanes, Archombrotvs , and much surer, by which Sicily may wash away this staine. But the fates haue giuen the power of this cure to Kings only: and we hope, that by Meleander's care and piety, the violence of this disease will cease, if once these Ciuill wars had an end, which haue euer bin auaileable to the Hyperephanians . They are to be subdued by peace, ease, and a happy gouernment, when they shall get nothing by publike robberies, to bestow vpon their wauering and seditious assistants: neither in the hottest pursuit of them by their opposites, doe they lose much of their owne. Besides, many of the chiefe of them haue respect towards the King, vpon whose fauour, in that calme of peace all things depend. Now, if he shall be pleased to discountenance their discipline, not so much with hate as contempt; he shall that way, sooner then by any warre, bring the nobler sort to penitence: who, if they should bee restrained by their owne proud shamefastenesse to abiure their Sect, yet at least they would take order for their children, and put them ouer to such Tutors, as they might be instructed in the old way, and so afterwards liue gracious in the Court. For, euen those, which preferre their obstinacy before heauen, before reason, and before the precepts of their Elders, and cleaue to Vsinulca ; will yet bee wonne, beleeue me, by this way to honour, and hope of preferment from the King, discreetly barred from them: chiefly, if these penalties be not imposed vpon them by publike Edicts; (for, that were enough for already angry men, to fall to murmurings, conspiracies, and open rebellion,) but by a kinde of slow vsage, and the discretion of the King, not deuiding the offices of the Common- wealth amongst them, which may be conferred vpon others, nor suffering them to stray beyond the licence giuen them by the Lawes. In other matters I would haue beene gentle towards them, and sometimes by his affability, to shew worthy their studies to please him. For, many of them, their sect and institution; likely, were it not for that, to become better tempered, and like their Ancestors. And surely, it were better these should bee corrected, (while it may be done) then subuerted, or forced to a worse course. So these, how-euer slow remedies, will by little cut in pieces the sinewes of the Hyperephanians : and those that vnder shew of a deeper vnderstanding, held so close together, will at length, by a slow and vn- inforced inhibition of the old discipline, the Philosophie, that was the cause of so much pride, being shaken off and despised, be easily seuered. But these were fit discourses for a time of more settled peace, which, oh that the gods would restore to this Countrey, and not suffer these Hyperephanians to ayde become of their religion: nor that hee, to be gracious with that faction, being scarce the fortieth part of the Sicilians , will incurre the danger of becomming odious to the rest. When Ibvrranes had thus spoken, he inuited Archombrotvs to supper, and in way of friendship aduised him, that he himselfe would vse the Hyperephanians kindly. For, (as the affaires of Sicily now stood) they might better be reclaimed by affability, example, and calme argument, then by professed and mutuall hatred and bandying.  The enterprise of Eristhenes against the King Meleander. Archombrotvs much troubled in mind. A Present sent to Poliarchvs .  for the execution of their designe, in the midst of the Spring, on the tenth of that moneth, which was called Thargelion . Eristhenes , not farre from Eipercte , had a Mannour, and a Parke in it full of Decre. He, on the day appointed for the exploit, had vndertaken to inuite Meleander thither with Argenis , to a Banquet. If the plot went cleerely on, he would surprize Meleander and Argenis , hauing first brought them with a few followers, to an inner roome of the house, with pretence to shew them some curious Tables and Pictures, and with all speed send them out by a backe gate, to be deliuered to Lycogenes . If Meleander resisted, or called too loud for helpe, they would kill him: it was enough to haue Argenis in their power. But if Meleander should that day, either through mistrust or sicknesse, keepe within Eipercte , then Lycogenes should be at hand with a suddaine Army to assault him. For it was appointed, that he should that day be at Syracusa , whither those of his faction, as in the name of the Cities and Nobility, should flocke vnto him with great acclamation, to make him their Generall, for the common cause against the King. Olo odemvs was to come after with a choice company before raised for that purpose, and by his voyce and forces, to iustifie this new designe. They had a conceit, that most Townes would reuolt from the King; some by example of the former warres, and others through the treason of their Gouernours and Magistrates, many of whom themselues had aduanced; and some out of meere inclination to sedition. Both sides thus resolued, Meleander intends to intrap Lycogenes , and he Meleander . But Argenis now oppressed with a twofold care, while she wished good fortune both to Poliarchvs and to Sicily , vsed exceeding diligence in pressing the King to that which her friends had moued him. Presents were to be made ready for Poliarchvs, Arsidas to be called home; and the affaire required a man of much trust to manage it. None, but cogitations of hers could hardly escape his obseruation, who now languished dayly vnder the tyranny of loue, and with no common iealousie was prying into her zealous carefulnesse for Poliarchvs . Aboue all things he accused himselfe, that he had first aduised the King to call Poliarchvs backe; so as sometimes he was minded to goe priuately to Meleander , and aduise him to the contrary; but restrained with shame, and withall fearing the displeasure of Argenis , he kept him from that headdy resolution. It chanced him to goe to Meleander , as hee was in talke with his Daughter about the returne of Arsidas : and now indeed he was much esteemed of therfore cheerefully eying him, as the Patron of her owne cause, saluted him also more kindly then she was wont, and so affected him with these fauours, whereof he little knew the cause, as rapt with an exstasie of ioy, that, as soone as he might, hee got backe to his lodging to recollect his spirits. There, betweene the excesse of his ioy, and the instability of it, doubtfull what to thinke, hee had these speeches to himselfe: But art thou then so happy? Hast thou sacrificed to Loue? Why not? Didst thou not see the Ladies countenance? Not her eyes? Did she not almost leape for ioy at thy comming? Vnhappy man! too foolishly doe I flatter my hopes. Neuer doe the gods giue so great felicity so easily. No stormes, no disasters memorize vulgar marriages: but in such a high loue, fortune hath a hand, that it may be more emboldened by the greatnesse of the toyle to the pursuer. Oh! may I be deceiued in my doubts. Neither in that salute, that sweet countenance of Wo is mee! had these signes of good-will (which I dare not stand the thought of!) relation to Poliarchvs ? and she therefore the kinder, because I gaue my voice for his recalling before the King? Did she by that countenance request my helpe againe for him? No loue (no, by Argenis her selfe) were so much worth. Neither will I be indebted to Poliarchvs for Argenis fauour, nor Argenis to me for Poliarchvs . Shall I, the minister of another mans happinesse, labour mine owne ruine? Shall I, an abiect and low- spirited fellow, be loued for almost seruile offices, and giue Argenis to another? Yet art thou mistaken, Archombrotvs , if thou thinkest to worke by force. By suite, patience, obseruance, is loue to bee obtained. Wouldst thou serue Argenis , or command her? How vnmannerly a speech were this; I would not haue you loue Poliarchvs ? Scarce would the harshest Father giue such a charge. Shee is vnworthy to bee loued, if shee will not loue the most excellent. Poliarchvs must be contended with by vertue, glory, and renowne. Nay, indeede, it makes for thee to haue him heere againe. For, wee haue euer tender thoughts, and full of pitty, of absent friends; but beeing present, as perhaps hee might please her, so peraduenture, either by falling out or disdaine, grow vnacceptable. Search to know why she loues him, and attempt by the same vertue to approue thy selfe vnto her. Doe what he can, thou wilt be aboue him in affection: and if other things happen not well, let the sword make an end of him. Matter of quarrell will easily be found: and, be hee neuer so strong, yet that loue which shall guide my hand, will be stronger. In the meane time, while we treate about his returne, Argenis will be willing to entertaine discourse. She will be vsed to heare mee, and beleeue me. And many times, where goodwill is once settled, it preuaileth farther to other ends, then those for which it begunne. When Archombrotvs had (much against his heart) forced himselfe to take this course, he returnes to Meleander ; and there by the present occasion, is forced to the passion of a new indignation. For, Cleobvlvs had perswaded the King, that the presents which were sent to Poliarchvs , should come as from Argenis . Shee, said hee, had no hand in the businesse that droue him out of Sicily : yet the care of the Kingdome, next to you, belongeth to her. Besides, he will know, that in her requests yours also are included: and though he would peraduenture be harsh to vs, yet surely he will not deny a Lady. Meleander wonderfully approuing this opinion; Go too, said hee; it rests now to make choyce of the Present, and a fit man to beare it. Timonides was a valiant young man, and of approoued trust towards for this stolne Embassie. This thus concluded vpon, they aduised what Present to send. By chance, a Syrian Marchant had brought Indian and Arabian wares; an vnthrifty brauery, for the most part, for vaine-glorious Nations. Amongst the rest, there was a Bracelet of wouen silke, which was so garnished all ouer with little stones of seuerall kinds, distinguished by their colours, as they did figure either the flight or the rage of diuers wild beasts, whom the hunters heere followed with their speares; there, entertained with their Iauelins. A mighty price it was of, both for the Iewels, and the workmanship; valued indeed at fifty talents. Many of the Sicilians had seene it, and many had heard it famed by the labour of a no meane Poet, whom the lustre of it had forced to these Lines.  Speake, you neere neighboures to the rising Sunne, How bright that god from out your Sea does runne, When th' Emeraulds he dyes in cheerefull greene, And makes the Diamond like himselfe to shine. The Iasper, various, pale's the Onix fram'd; Purple that stone, that from the fire is nam'd. Where, mixt with azure flames and gold, he showes Like the discoloured Iris Watry bowes. But all these Iemmes in no one shore are found: It were too great a glory for one ground. Some Pearles enrich the Erythraean shore; Some, bright Hydaspes , some, great Ganges store. This Bracelet all containes, equall to all: Into this worke doth th'whole Earth's lustre fall. Ye gods, what price, what fashion does it beare? What happy wrist shall this rich Bracelet weare? How well the various light shootes through the stone! How well the hunters faces there are showne! Heere, precious arrowes wound a wealthy Stagge: There, stands a Lyon, of his owne price bragge. Did Vvlcan , or th' Telchines , not as yet Turn'd into Rockes, those Iemmes so closely set: When hee the Earth with showrie lightning feares. And make her quite her iealous scolding cease. But thou, that thus shalt thy rich arme attire, If Fame thy thoughts, or perfect vertue fire; Enrich thy mind, lest thou of Pyrrha's race, Compar'd to these rich stones, appeare but base.  meanes Lycogenes practised to discouer the Kings designe: He writes a Letter to Poliarchvs .  present for Poliarchvs , the rather, for that it was easily portable without feare of discouery. For, this was to be closely carried. Horses or Armour, if they had been sent, could not haue scaped the sight of their enemies. Besides, this kinde of weare was in most Countries as vsuall with men as women, and therefore the fittest for a woman to bestowe vpon a man. The King before this had little valued it, being troubled with greater busines: yet was it left with Eristhenes as Treasurer, with charge to informe himselfe by the aduice of such kinde of Artificers, whether it were for the Kings turne if he should buy it. Now, lest any one should wonder at this hasty buying of it, the King calls for the Dice, and at play with Argenis , losing of purpose, as if they had played for the Bracelet, sends for fortune, not yet fauourable to him, had a suspition before of some message to be sent to Poliarchvs . They beleeued after, that this suspition tooke beginning from his wife, who vsing often to come to Argenis and crafty woman, and taught to her husbands purposes. But when once the King had commanded the Bracelet to be bought, and in such a time of a weake Treasury; his suspition was so increased, that hee presently writes to Lycogenes , how hee feared, that Poliarchvs his friendship was sought by this gift. And he againe, quicke to any execrable villany, and withall, by Olo odemvs his perswasion (for hee by chance was then with him) wrote backe, chiefly to this purpose; that nothing could bee wiselier done, (since the Bracelet was yet with Eristhenes ) then to infect it with poyson. If Poliarchvs once receiued it, no doubt but hee would weare it about his arme, and the poyson, through the bearers heate, pierce the vitall parts: but if the King should giue it to Argenis , that would time enough be discouered: For the poyson would doe no hurt at the first touch; and they themselues, by one deuice or other, would giue notice of the hidden danger, and so get an opinion of a wonderfull fidelity, by laying the blame vpon the Marchant. for the cutting off of their enemies. The Ephyr aeans , a cunning people in mingling poyson with drinke, or infecting of darts, when they brought hither their Colonies, and built Syracusa , had long agoe taught the Sicilians this base Art. And Meleander himselfe, hauing been often this way layed for, had, by the most diligent care of his seruants, that had the charge of his dyet and clothes, beene preserued. Yet the poyson was of such force, that it did not onely kill with the taste, but with the dayly touch, it would conuey the venom thorow the skinne, when the pores were opened with heate. inside of the Bracelet into the dissolued poyson, being lined with a silken quilt, next to his arme; and when he thought he had infused enough of the iuyce, he carried it to the King in a boxe: who, nothing knowing of this horrible wickednesse, commanding all, saue Argenis , to depart, he priuately calles Timonides , and willes him faithfully to discharge that trust, whereof hee was thought worthy. Then shewes he him to what affaire he is designed, and giues him a Letter to Arsidas , written with his owne hand, to this effect: Arsidas , I haue sent Timonides , whom you see, vnto you; I would haue you so to credit him, as if you heard my selfe speaking. Whatsoeuer hee shall say or doe, I will approue. Yet know neuerthelesse, the sooner you shall come with my guest, you shall be the more welcome. Farewell. Then Argenis , as it had beene appointed, takes the boxe out of the lap of her loose robe; and, Timonides , quoth she, carry this Letter to Letter, and another to Arsidas . Then giues she him the Letters, not those which she had shewed to Meleander ; for they were but cold and complementall, and farre below the greatnesse of the loue betweene her and their places, before prepared, answerable to their mutuall affection. But because Timonides his iourney into Italy could not be concealed, lest the suspition should be increased by the dissembling it, hee began (by the Kings direction) to giue out amongst his friends, that hee had got licence to leaue the Court, and to trauell into Italy and Africa . He was young, and it fell out fitly; that not long before, hauing a great desire to see forraigne parts, hee had acquainted many of his familiar friends with his purpose. But Eristhenes , euer watchfull to treachery, had discouered much, and suspected euery thing: mistrusting therefore that Timonides went to that he might finde out the truth, hee hath this crafty fetch: Amongst his followers, he had a young man, newly come out of the Country; and, so, not yet knowne in the Court: but hee had knowne him to be a slye Youth,  & quicke to performe what was giuen him in charge. He bids him take a horse, and follow the King on purpose, to giue him strict warning, that he should let no man in Sicily liuing, haue notice of the bracelet. But whilest you speake, saith hee, obserue carefully, with what countenance hee heares you. If hee sayes, yea, or seeme to doubt, doe you, as hauing performed your charge, leaue him presently: but if he knowes not what you meane, which you will easily finde; then, as if you doubted to be mistaken, aske his name. When he shall say, if you can, get from him, that he may not know, what way you take. But if, because you are a stranger, hee shall sticke at an answer, and aske who you are; you may say, you are one of Selenissa's kinsmen, lately come to Court, and giue your selfe what name shall first come to your minde. The Youth speedily dispatched this businesse, fayling neyther in diligence nor fortune: For, Timonides , as soone as he heard of the bracelet, which he knew to be so great a secret, neuer suspected him, but bade him go tell the King, that all was safe: and that of this secret he had sufficient charge before. would haue Timonides surprized, or thinke of any other course, hee might not lose his time. Lycogenes not knowing what to doe, now that he found the King not slothfull, but busily counter-plotting against him, begun to wax cholerick in his contempt of him. At length, a new deuice comes into his head; to turne the enuy of his own vilde fact of poysoning, vpon the King. Hereupon (what none would euer imagine,) he resolues to sollicit euen Poliarchvs himselfe to league with him, and to write to him to this effect: the choyce of friends or enemies, this day shall discouer. Pursuing me as your enemy, would to God you had not done more obseruance to Meleander , than hee deserued. But I omit past things: For, now neyther were it humanity to accuse you: neyther am I in that case, but I can well excuse my selfe. I had much rather, you should know by my good offices, than by words, whether of vs two offended most in our former enmity. Meleander , fearing your wrath and reuenge for your expulsion, hath betaken himselfe to wicked Arts: and being of a King, become a poysonet, hath sent you, as an acknowledgement of his penitence, and an amends for your wrongs, a bracelet infected with most dismall iuyces. See you weare it not. For; it is death, not a bracelet, which you shall beare about your arme. For mee, I desire not to be credited before tryall. If then you haue a slaue condemned, or (touched with more humanity) desire but the death of a Dogge or other beast, apply this present to his bare skin: If hee dye not within foure dayes, I am not worthy to liue. If you be wise, you will force that wicked bearer of the deadly gift, that wicked that from mee especially you should haue notice of this treachery, which with much adoe I haue discouered, that a man of so high desert, should not fall by so soule an end, nor altogether perish vnder my enuy. For, which of my enemies would not rather giue it out, you were cut off by me, than Meleander ? From hence forward, you may thanke me, as you please. If you continue my enemy, I can reuenge it openly: My Armes, my counsels, and my powers are in readinesse: and I haue the gods propitious to my designes. But if Meleander's treason thus discouered, shall giue you a better minde, and you will ioyne your forces with mine, to reuenge this iniury: I here promise, that while I liue, you shall not want a brother, nay, and since such are my yeeres, not a father. This Letter of such bold matter he deliuers to a seruant of tryed trust, with this charge, that he should so proportion his iourney, as he might bee with thither. Neither would it be hard so to doe. At Messana , or at Rhegium , in the Port, or in the City, he might, as minding other businesse, a farre off, inquire of the arriuall of Timonides . His purpose in this diuellish plot indeed was, that eight whole dayes should passe, in which Poliarchvs might weare the infected Quilt, and so be poysoned. For, if this Letter should bee brought so iumpe vpon Poliarchvs his death, what a foule aspersion would it cast vpon Meleander ? But if Poliarchvs should so long forbeare the wearing of it, then would hee both be infinitely obliged to fiercely incensed against Meleander , whom this cunning tricke of discouery would make odious. And he was the bolder to speake reproachfully of the King, because this Letter could scarcely come to Poliarchvs his hands, before the time appoynted for the reuolt of the Conspirators.   thoughts vpon the intising of Lycogenes and Olo odemvs vnto him: and by seuerall Letters sends for them both. Lycogenes was resolued to obey, his affaires, being not yet ripe for a defection, and to be some few dayes with the King. But Olo odemvs , vpon the receit of the Kings Letter, would not come at the Court, before hee had seene Lycogenes . There, as they consulted each with other, it appeared very suspitious, that the King had sent for them both: If he meant any violent course against them, hee would more boldly dare to put in act against them both, then against one of them. The safest course was, that Lycogenes should goe to Court to discouer their practices. So, departing from Lycogenes , as soone as he came to Eipercte , he presently saluted the King, and was that night admitted to supper, and deliuered Lycogenes his Letter, importing his excuse; for that hee had a dangerous sicknesse, and could not brooke the ayre. The King nothing doubting, but that this sicknesse was fained, yet with the same dissembling they vsed to him, asked many questions of the nature of his sicknesse. The Supper ended, he calls to him Cleobvlvs, Evrymedes , and , who had contemptuously refused to come: and with Olo odemvs also, and be there, being guilty. Archombrotvs and Evrymedes were of opinion, that as yet it was not fit to stirre, but to try Lycogenes with the like sleight: That while he was loose, it was in vaine to attempt any thing against the other. But, me thinkes, said Cleobvlvs , wee should doe well, to lose nothing of the prey wee haue in hold. Doe you thinke Lycogenes , if he were not conscious of some intended Treason, would dally with the King vpon so vaine a pretext of sicknesse? The gods turne all to the best. But for as much as I can gather by coniecture, and trusty intelligence, both these will steale away, and we shall streight see him vp in armes. Marke, what I thinke fit. Let the King send againe for him. I shall neuer doubt to take his refusall for a reuolt. In the meane time, it will not be amisse to set a Guard of trusty men vpon Olo odemvs and Eristhenes , with such caution neuerthelesse, as they may not perceiue they are caught. When it shall plainely appeare that be abated of Lycogenes his power, when two such Leaders, of so great estate, and so many Followers shall be once cut off. This seuerity, besides, will by a most happy change, be followed with an awfull reuerence to the King, in many hearts, and feare of punishment. the King writ to Lycogenes , with words of Maiesty mixt with intreaties, commanding him to come. Hee, growing more and more full of suspition, not onely not obeyed, but also by message aduised Olo odemvs and And now they must deale by open force: for, the time appoynted for the warre was at hand. Neyther of them set light by this coniecture of Lycogenes : yet escaped they not the diligence of Cleobvlvs , to whom two of priuate messages discouered much of their Masters secrets. From them hee had notice, that Horses were in readinesse vnder Eipercte , for Eristhenes his escape by night. The King, exceeding glad to haue their secret flight to charge them withall, in proofe of their crime, giues Archombrotvs Commission to take them with the fact, and bring them backe againe by force. And hee, all on fire to performe this charge, did with great diligence, by Evrymedes his speciall direction, put all things in readinesse. It was plaine, they would goe out with but a few, lest the noyse should discouer their flight. Archombrotvs therefore tooke no more than tenne souldiers, and those Spaniards ; lest by commerce of language, or contagion of Faction, they should stand for those Noble men, against whom they were then armed. Each of them slipt out of the Castle, as Archombrotvs had comanded, without suspition. He by and by followes, and stayes them in readinesse for the exploit, in a fit place, vnder an old Cotage, by which they must of necessity passe from the Court. Hee had not long kept his standing, when by Moone-light he discernes Olo odemvs and Eristhenes , attended onely with three seruants, comming on with high speed, not so much as looking about them. He then with his ten souldiers affronts them: And whither now, Olo odemvs , saith he? Whither now, else flye you thus by night? why together? why without acquainting the King? What meanes your being alone, without seruants, without friends? They were confounded at their apprehension. And he layed hands on them, and brings them backe againe, trembling with the horrour of their sudden misery. They were presently sent to the Triumviri , to be kept in prison as Traytors. There were manifest proofes of their flight; their horses not farre off attending with their Groomes, and their Riding-sutes about them, vnder their vsuall garments. This caused presently a great deale of broyle: and the next day, when it was reported to Ibvrranes and Dvnalbivs , (who then by chance were gone to something long with Antenorivs the chiefe Priest of the Church, a man of most sweet conuersation) hastening their Coach, with all speed came back to the King, who imbracing them at their comming, after relation of the whole matter; If the gods giue me leaue, said hee, I will make these two, examples: These two at least, shall neuer againe contemne mee vnreuenged: Neyther am I frighted with the sawcy boldnesse of those Villaines, that haue dared to menace me with Libels scattered abroad. For, see here, what a malapert scroll one of my Chamber found this morning at my doore. Dvnalbivs taking the Paper, hee, with Ibvrranes , while the King turned to others, were strucke with horror at the reading of these Verses:  Restore these men. Why, Tyrant, dost thou threat With feeble fraud, whom warre could not defeat? Those valiant Chiefes, the grace of Sicily , In a darke squalled Dungeon must not dye. Restore them; or no reuerence shall withstand Of thy crown'd head, or Scepter-bearing hand, Or short Sydonian Cloake, the vengefull steele, That thou from this incensed Land shalt feele. The Land it selfe, the Mountaines doe desire To couer thee: but thou to our iust ire Shalt come a Sacrifice: as once in Tyre Pale, guilty, visage-chang'd Penthevs appear'd, And Bacchvs angry sacrificers fear'd; By whom his soule from her torne Mansion fled, And o're the Fields his panting limbes were spred. And that euen now thy Palace does not crack To Ashes in our flames, thinke vs not slack, Or fearefull, cruell King. Wee spare those men That thou deteyn'st. They are thy fate: and then, When they expire, thou diest. The fatall brand Not surer Meleager's life conteyn'd. Those safe, as pledges of thy life preserue: Or, if the gods will giue thee leaue t'obserue Good counsell; at our iust request release Those Captaines now, and purchase, so, thy peace.  complaints of Arsidas and Timonides : their returne into Sicily ; they meet with Gelanorvs .  crossed with other ill fortunes. The manner of his trauell, and the successe, was thus: After his dispatch from the King, he spent three dayes, much against his will, in his owne house, staying to sacrifice and take Augury, which the Priest could not dispatch in lesser time: Hee comes after to Messana , to waters both swelling of themselues in the beginning of the Spring. For foure dayes no man durst put to Sea out of that Port. In the meane time, were the Ships sore weather-beaten; some bruised one against another by the Seas violence; some, cast on the Sands, lying there vpon one side. with supply of such things as the storme had spoyled, and hoysed Sayle, though the storme were yet scarce layed: suffering no Passenger, but those of his owne company, to be taken aboord: he had sayled but halfe way, when a fearefull spectacle of a late ship-wracke appeared to the Ship-men. A Ship was drowned by a leake, whereof the maine Mast was yet still in sight aboue water, by reason it stucke there, not ouer-turned, but ouer-whelmed. And, which was a most lamentable sight, there stood a Mariner holding fast the Sayle-yard, onely left aliue of the ship-wracke, of a pale and dying countenance, saue that he was parched with the winde. He, with beckning with his hand, and nodding of his head, (for, the noyse of the waues drowned his cryes) besought them to saue him from death, and not vneasily drew them all to pitty him. Some of the Mariners therefore got downe into the boat: and as he cast himselfe downe off the Mast, they tooke him in, being almost stiffe with cold, and brought him to Timonides . But then, his spirits being loosened, which his exceeding feare had before strayned, halfe dead, hee spreads himselfe a long time on the deck of the ship; till such time as being something reuiued with the sent of Wine, and required by Timonides to tell him what he was, and whither he was bound, when this mischance befell him. My Countrey, said hee, is Rhegium , and by profession I am a Pylote: I was now bound for France , whither I had vndertaken to carry a most excellent Gentleman. I perceiued, the Sea was not safe from tempests: for the rack was driuen but with a small, yet an vncertaine and various winde, and the Aire was horrible blacke and fearefull. I was not therefore willing to put forth to Sea. But when after many commands: I had put out into the deepe: at first, the windes at warre amongst themselues, snatcht vs by turnes towards other and contrary parts, and then, as in mockery of vs, quite left the Ship. I, as I had reason, now more fearefull of danger in such a sudden calme, began to hearten my fellowes, to make to Land lustily with their Oares, during this stilnesse of the Sea. For, after this, exceeding faire weather would instantly follow some great danger: wherefore they should bend their course towards Sicily , the next place offered vs by Fortune, for our safety. But he that had hyred the Ship, vtterly denyed to goe for Sicily , and so drawes his sword, threatning to cut off his hand, that should first lay it on Oare to row that way. In this debating whither to go, a day was spent, and presently the Moone with her red hornes fore-tells a storme. But now the ruffling weather did not rise, as it was wont, by degrees: but the Ayre suddenly thickning, did so rayse the waues, that euen at the first my best Art was of no vse to me. We were tossed vp and downe, doubtfull what the storme would doe with vs, keeping vs euer in the midst of fearefull and aduerse whirle-windes. After the night was passed in these extremites, and the day threatned worse, we cut our haire, though our deuotion did vs little good. For, lo, on a sudden, we stucke, moored vpon a shelfe. The violence of the storme had raysed the sand to a Mount, and stayed the Prow of the ship. Now were the plankes loosened, and we by all meanes make haste with our Oares and shouels to the Sterne; when he, by whom I was hyred, with his seruant, and two Mariners next to him, leapt into the boat, and cutting the Cable, aduentured himselfe to most certaine shipwracke. They were quickly driuen by the storme out of our sight. The waues were high and strong, against which the poore little boat could not long hold out: neither had we leisure, being our selues a perishing, to grieue for others losse. For the weather-beaten ship gaue way now to the tempests fury, and the water entred thorow his wide leakes. O gods! what a fearefull noyse! how dolefull was the cry of the dying men, when the Sea begun to couer the ship? I got vp vpon the Mast: poore wretch, I got vp! Only so long to defer my death, till the drowned ship should fall on one side, and the Mast with it. But the gods fauoured me aboue my hope. The ship stood so vpright, as it were vnder-set with the incompassing sands, as yonder Mast kept me safe, which now also, not without benefit to others, shewes it selfe aboue water, to warne passengers to auoid betimes those dangerous shelues. It is now two daies, since with a sad imbrace, I haue in my armes kept the top-mast, halfe dead with cold, but most with despaire: for sleepe and food I neuer once thought of. But when the appeased power of the gods gaue mee hope of helpe from you, I onely held out my not yet disioynted armes to the Sea. While he was thus speaking, they all listened to him with teares: but shipwrack't man? He came from Italy , he auoyded Sicily ; both which interrupts the Sea-man, as he was bewailing the hard fate of his fellowes;  & telling, how, as they laboured to get vpon the tops of some neere steepe rockes, the cruell waues had caught them backe againe. And, what was the mans name, said he, whom you were to carry? Was he a natiue of Rhegium , or a stranger there? He answers, that he knew nothing else, but that Arsidas , a Sicilian , who had much faire Land at Rhegium , had hyred the ship, and borne his friend company to the hauen. Timonides was strucke cold at heart; and, to mourne with more freedome, he couered his face,  & got himselfe into his Cabin in the ship, commanding the Rowers to help the winde, though it sate neuer so faire, with all their power. Not long after, he arriued at Rhegium , and willing the saued Mariner to follow him, goes to Arsidas . He was then by chance, it being about mid-day, lying vpon a Pallet, reuoluing many things in his minde, little knowing of his neere approaching sorrow. But when, informed of his friends comming, he leapt out to imbrace,  & was entred into cheereful and hospitable complement, Timonides interrupting him with a sigh; My doe I know more then your selfe? Thus saying, he calls in the ship-man, whom when Arsidas saw, he had, with a sudden feare, a presage of their casting away. And now growne more pale then Timonides , Hast thou,  o Mariner, said he, any where safely landed the charge I deliuered thee? For, in France , whither you were bound, you could not arriue in so small time. But he, alas, replyes; You see me alone left of the ship wracke: My ship, my fellowes, my passengers, all that I had, I haue lost in this mercilesse tempest. sorrow, entertained the other mourners into his houses neither had he the leisure, being almost quite dead, to aske of the manner of the wracke: but being priuat in his Chamber with Timonides , he did nothing but repeat the mournfull death and hard fate of Poliarchvs , of whom the Land was farre vnworthy, and such other things as are euer frequent in a fresh and raging sorrow. And when Timonides , after many teares, asked him, whither putting to Sea? He had answer from Arsidas , that Poliarchvs doubted to stay at Rhegium , in respect of the neerenesse to Sicily : for, there (said he) hee could not be long concealed from Lycogenes : and how easily might some desperate cut-throats be sent from the opposite shore to murder him? He resolued therefore to goe for France ; his owne Country, as I beleeue: and from thence to make a speedy returne to vs. But such, alas, was the enuy of the Fates, as they would not suffer the earth longer to boast it selfe of a man so almost equall to the immortall gods. But Timonides , amidst his sighs, thinking of Meleanders good minde towards Poliarchvs , deliuers Arsidas the Letters, and shewes him the Bracelet, taking it out of the Box, the vnprofitable gift from Argenis . But his griefe would not giue him leaue to admire the riches and workmanship thereof. Hauing sorrowfully spent that night, they both resolue to returne to were perswaded, that by this time Sicily was vp in armes. They therefore winde about their course, that they might, if it were possible, take Land in the Port of Eipercte . The gusts of winde were diuers and vnconstant, as most commonly they are in the Spring-time: and the seuenth day they were within ken of Eipercte . But the neerer they came to the shore, the more cruell sorrow (poore men!) tormented them. They would now haue wished not to haue found the land, which ere-while they had with all their Oares so laboriously sought. For, with what face could they bring news of so great a mischiefe? or who would not euer after hold them ominous? Chiefly, Arsidas was massacred, not with one griefe alone, or that Timonides was acquainted withall; neyther did her dying, and (which is more horrible) to kill her himselfe with his sad story? With what a stormy countenance would she vpbraid him, that he would send one, whom Timoclea had kept safe in the middest of his enemies, to his death by sea? Why should he suffer him to goe, at least alone, that had been so earnestly commended to his care? While he was busied with these  & the like thoughts, the least of his care was, that he should lose the reward of his fidelity and trauell. He was in terrible awe of the Ladies anger, being to receiue his iudgement from her eyes, whether he ought to liue. Neither would shee be dallyed with by dissembling, or appeased by delay. For, whatsoeuer it behoued Meleander to know, must not Argenis be presently made acquainted with it? And in case himselfe should conceale, and not tell the King this sad mischance, yet what would Timonides doe, being, through his extremity of griefe, equally impatient of speech, and of silence? What eyther of their friends, who would, in regard of the strangenesse of so great a losse, be euer busie in asking questions? Amidst this mist of fancies, the Ship arriued in the creeke of the Hauen, and deliuers them (much perplexed) to Sicily . First of all, they charge their friends and seruants, that they report not a word abroad, before themselues had been with the King. Hauing quickly got vp that way of the Hill that leades to the Towne, they come to the Court-gate; and there,  o wondrous mixture of the Destinies!) the first man they cast their eyes on, was vpon Gelanorvs , carelesly walking betweene two Sicilians , with a cheerefull countenance. same sight, was not able for a while to speake, but poynted with his hand, and laboured for breath. Presently, recouering his voyce, Are we, said he, deluded with apparitions? or, what a strange confusion is this? Is not yonder the wracke? What Mercvry hath brought him againe, amongst the liuing? ran to Gelanorvs , who now also seeing his friends, made towards them. But they were strucke mute with astonishment, and could doe nothing but gaze in his face. Arsidas , at last, thus with a sigh begins; Doe I see thee aliue, Gelanorvs , or art thou but a shaddow, and here seek'st an empty tombe at least for thy drowned Master, and thy selfe? Gelanorvs willeth him to lay aside these feares: for Poliarchvs liued, safe from the storme, and from Pyrates: That being from him sent to the King, he came but the day before to Eipercte . They began eagerly to question him of the whole story, what mis-hap had befalne them, what safety, what confidence there might be, the Ship once drowned, in the raging Sea. But Meleander preuented this relation, who seeing them out at a window, caused them to be called, being troubled about the circumstances of another prodigious businesse, which hee hoped to be by them resolued in.  What happened to Poliarchvs in a little Boate, after the shipwracke: his combate with the Pirates; a strange aduenture: Of the Letter sent by Africa .  towards France , was split on the sands, and began to sinke with his load of water, he betooke himselfe with Gelanorvs and two Mariners into the Ship- boat; neither did they struggle against the wind, saue that by the cunning and strength of the Oares they kept the Boat vpright. So, beeing carried about the next Promontorie, they lost the sight of the Ship, whose ruine they had escaped. Afterwards, the winds growing stiller, when they had long beene tossed vp and downe, the Boat dashed vpon a Rocke, couered but with shallow waters, and there forsooke her passengers. Then leaped they into the sea, where they were vpon the firme, but vn-euen Rockes so receiued, as none of them stood in lesse water than vp to his knees, nor any of them were wet to the middle. It was farre to the shore, no ship within kenne, and the greatnesse of the danger had quite taken away all hope. Poliarchvs would haue ended his misery by the sword: Gelanorvs chose rather to dye by the waues: and the Mariners, not out of hope of life, but the horrour of death, said, they were best vpon those cragges to expect the helpe of Nature, or fortune. Whilest they are thus debating of their fate, they might discerne a farre off, a ship tossed with the waues, and by little and little comming neerer to them. It was a Pirates Barke, well trimmed and rigged against stormes, and so had escaped the Sea's cruelty: and now the winds growing gentler, begun againe to be steered by the Rudder. The Pilot very well knew of the Rockes that lay vnder water in that Coast; whom the Sea's thicke foame, and the lowd roaring of the waues about the shelues, did now discouer was therefore steering his Barke another way, when on the suddaine hee perceiues some pieces of the Boat, which had carried Poliarchvs : and withall, some men appeared from the next Rockes, with hands held vp, pittifully requesting the succour of the passers by. The Pirates made a doubt to take them in: For, what reward should they haue for their kindnesse? or what prey was to be expected from shipwrack'd men? And the cruelty of their profession had quite blotted all humanity out of their hearts. Yet, because many passengers keepe their richest and most precious things about them, vnder their clothes, they agreed to goe to the prey; and, the Sea growne much quieter then before, quickly sent out a Boat; which, for feare of dashing vpon the rockes, they rowed softly, and often founded what depth they did draw. They willed the poore distressed men to come vpon the Rockes and firme sands, as neere as they could to the Boat. At length their Oares serued for a bridge; which the Pirates reaching foorth, came close with their Boat to the next Rocke. But at the sight of Poliarchvs and Gelanorvs , they were all amazed: and, rauished as well with the excellence of their persons, as the riches of their apparell, had much muttering among themselues of the greatnesse of the spoile. But as soone as they were once taken out of the Boate into the Barke, then, no longer dissembling their villany, the Pirates offered to put chaines on the as Captiues, to the great astonishment of Poliarchvs at this monstrous vsage; who quickly drawing his sword; Why, men, said hee, what would you haue? What anger? What displeasure? Or how haue wee, whom but now you thought worthy to deliuer from death, with the hazzard of your owne liues, so soone offended you? Nor with lesse quicknesse did Gelanorvs catch his sword, and put backe his fetters. But when they, nothing quelled with Poliarchvs words, grew more outragious, and betooke them to their swords; Poliarchvs no longer staied his hand, but sheathed his sword in his bowels that was offering to lay chaines on him. When hee had done the like with another; Gelanorvs also hauing dispatched one of the, comes close to his Master: then standing backe to backe, to auoyd being incompassed about, they face their enemies both wayes: and withall breaking off the blades of the Oares, which lay scattered on the decke, they vsed them for the defence of their heads, in stead of Bucklers. The very Mariners also, that were taken with Poliarchvs , whom the Pirates were lading with Irons, encouraged with so braue example, tooke heart to snatch vp the Ship-poles, and to make resistance. Some of the Captiues were bound with cords, besides those which were fastened to the Oares with chaines. These did gladly behold this fight: who, as Poliarchvs perceiued by their lookes, wished him good successe. And hee, supposing their helpe might much aduantage him, cuts in pieces some of their cords with his sword, and requests them to fight couragiously against these villaines. Those now vnbound, presently set their fellowes free; so as now the number on both sides was almost equall. There were thirteene Pirates in all: of these, two were slaine by Poliarchvs , and one by Gelanorvs . The two Mariners, and the Captiues freed by Poliarchvs , had fiue against them: and so, not vnreuenged. For, now had they throwne one of Poliarchvs his mariners ouer-boord: and one of the making offer at Poliarchvs his necke with a Halbert, and falsifying his blowe, hit him vnder the short ribbe. If his coate of maile had not bin, what an infinite griefe had that Halbert procured to with it dashed out his braines; with a loud and dauntlesse voyce animating assayling the rest, being most of them wounded. Those that were left aliue, being much dismayed, betooke themselues to the other part of the Ship, where the freed Captiues fought: but their courage now was also doubled by the successe of their friends. The Pirates, beset on one side by them, and by Poliarchvs and Gelanorvs on the other side, were so handled, as that Poliarchvs had much adoe to saue them from being slaine out-right euery man. For, he had rather haue them taken  & reserued for due punishment. Wherefore hee caused three that now kneeled for mercy, to be chained. And amidst the gratulations of the poore men, that by his valour had escaped the thraldome of the Robbers, he was principally comforted, that he had done a worke so behoofefull to the generall safety. They all with one voice call'd him their tutelar god, the god of their liberty; saying, he had shewed aboue a mortall force in the death of the Pirates, and that hee onely was worthy, to whom the vowes and petitions of poore distressed men should be offered from all parts of the world. But yet in this generall ioy, there was a difference of voyces. For, they which were onely bound with cords, and now were certaine of their liberty, did, without exception, gratulate both their owne fortunes and their Redeemers, but the Sailers wishing a more full benefit, besought him to free them from their bonds, and to restore them to the state from which they fell by this seruitude. questioned in order, who was Owner of that ship, who was Pilot, and from whence came these Pirates. Noble Sir, said one of the Rowers, who euer you bee, take pitty on mee: I built this ship at my owne charge, I gouerned her as Owner and Pilot, hauing often traded betwixt Africa and Spaine : I arriued by chance at the mouth of Butis , and there vnlading, I tooke in Spanish goods; when these Theeues, vnder the name of passengers, brought mee to all this misery. That their number might breed no suspition, they came to mee each man by himselfe, and neuer aboue two together: neither did they make shew to be bound all for one Port: Some were for Adrametum , some for Clupea , or Vtica . We were agreed of the hire. I, little dreaming of their wicked treachery, entertained them all: who, that they might the more cunningly entrappe mee, all the while we staied in the Hauen, or any helpe was to be had, made themselues strangers one to another. But after we were with a full wind gotten farre from Land, and many of the Mariners in faire weather layed to sleepe, they rushed all suddenly vpon vs. Mee they thrust from the Sterne: the rest they tooke betweene sleeping and waking, and chained to the Oares: and shewing themselues most exectable Pirates, of passengers they become masters at their owne pleasure. For, there wanted not skilfull Sea-men amongst them: and in stead of other goods, in their fardels they had brought chaines, which they put vpon all our legges. They happened afterwards vpon many smaller vessels, which they pillaged, and got store of weapons, prisoners, and wealth. Neither committed they those outrages at Sea onely, but often put to shore, and did many robberies by Land; and when they had gotten good booties, would bend their course to seeke new shores, and new villanies. As lately, after most of them had beene three dayes absent, they returned from Mauritania , loaden with purchase, hauing, as I gathered by their speeches, cunningly robbed the Queene of Mauritania of some Treasure, which she held in most esteeme. Hereupon, Poliarchvs askes one of the Pirates whom he had in chaines, whether this were true that he had heard of the Mariner? All which by his silence he confessed. But Poliarchvs pressed him more strictly about this last robbery; whether they had rifled the Queene of Mauritania her Treasurie? What meanes they had so to doe? and in what part of the ship they had hidden their spoile? He answered, That the fame of her rich Iewels had put them in heart to vndertake the exploit: That about the dead of night, seuen of them in armes stood at the corner of a street, that so, as if they were placed there by the Queene, they might keepe off such as passed that way; whilest two other with an iron Crow, broke open the thicke and strong barres of the window, and so, said he, we got entrance. When we had our desire, we came backe before day to Sea: and the whole purchase is yet vntouched, by reason that first we made amaine from that Coast, and since, the storme tooke vs: And because so great wealth should not breed any falling out, wee agreed to stay, till it might be diuided in calme weather. Then Poliarchvs followed the Pirate vnder the Decke; where opening the Chest, he finds much wealth, most of it likely to belong to Ladies that came out of Mauritania . But then, as if called by fortune to new enterprises, hee collects himselfe. His voyage into France , the gods seemed to crosse and deferre. Hee was forced out of his course by the storme: Hee had gotten a Ship accustomed to the Africke shore: and not to giue the Queene speedy notice of the recouery of her goods, were great inhumanity. And peraduenture (said hee) the gods haue a care of my glory. What hopes soeuer vnder a priuate habit I had in Sicily , they would not haue mee pursue by the valour and forces of my Countrey; that I may not owe the happinesse that shall befall mee, to my Nation, to my wealth, or to my Soldiers; but to my selfe. In Africa I may easily haue knowledge of the affaires of Sicily , and may send newes of my owne proceedings to Argenis . After this resolution, he thus speakes to the Pirate: Certainely, I thinke it fit, that both the Queene should haue her Treasure restored her, and you (wicked men) be giuen up to Iustice. I must now turne towards Mauritania ; neither that such a desperate wickednesse escape due punishment, nor any innocent men there suffer vnder your villany. So, without delay hee caused the Master of the ship, by whom he had all this notice touching the Pirates, to be freed from his chaines, and placed at the Sterne. The rest that were chained to the Oares, he would not let loose. For he both stood in neede of Rowers, to carry him into Africa ; and he would not, that so many vnknowne to him, and perchance not vndeseruing their bondage, should haue the meanes to doe him any harme. And therefore, after exact search of the keyes of all their bonds and bolts, he giues Gelanorvs the charge of keeping them. Yet, that they also might somewhat partake in the comfort of his victory; Set forward, Rowers, quoth hee; you are vpon the very point of your happinesse: onely bring me to Mauritania , and, so fauour me, Ivpiter , I will giue you all your liberty. What great harme is it to you, if for the gift of your freedome, I craue a short, but necessary transportation? If the Master of the Ship deceiue me not, we haue but two dayes sayle for Mauritania . There will my voyage, and your captiuity haue an end. The Saylers, much erected at so great a hope, did with like industry ply their Oares, as if each of them were not to goe for Africa , but to his owne house, or about his owne affaires. But the Master of the ship told him, that the Genius of the Sea would not brooke any dead bodies to be carried in the ship: that the Sea-gods would be angry:  & that such piety to the dead, had ofte procured much danger to the liuing. There lay three on the vpper decke, slaine in the conflict by the Pirates. Poliarchvs would not presume with an vntimely humanity to resist the receiued opinion of the Sea-men. Hee therefore excused himselfe to the gods below, that he cast them ouer vnburied; and promised, vpon his first arriuall in Africa , to appease their ghosts with tombes erected vpon the shore. They therefore, after leaue giuen them, take vp the bodies of the slaine; but lest any thing of value should be to no purpose lost, they begin to search what was hid vnder their garments. The spoiles of two were but a few pieces of coine: The third, as more gallant, had his legges and thighes couered with the large laps of his Coat, which as one of the Mariners plucked off, a Letter fell out, there before kept, as it seemed, for priuacy: which when Poliarchvs commanded to be deliuered to him, and had broken vp the seale, hee was strucke with horrour, that Letters should bee sent to him, and from Lycogenes! Lycogenes write to Poliarchvs ? and the Letter by so many prodigious chances come to his hands? He made doubt to beleeue his owne eyes in reading this beginning; Lycogenes to Poliarchvs health . He presently wills the body to be lifted vp; and to his own curious and inquisitiue eye, he vsed Gelanorvs his helpe, to see, if by any lineament they could remember that face, not yet much altered since his late death. But they might well misse the knowing of him, beeing but an obscure fellow, and one of Lycogenes his inferiour seruants. After diligent search, whether hee had any other Letters or newes about him, they cast him ouerboord; not yet knowing whether to take him for a friend or a Traitour. But this was he, whom house, he had gotten before him, and being intercepted by the Pirates, was slaine in the fight; as if fortune were in doubt, whether that Letter, of so much treachery, ought to be deliuered to Poliarchvs . Ship: and with a troubled mind and countenance, was almost confounded at euery word. Meleander was accused of poysoning, Lycogenes was the discouerer. He heard, how Meleander sought his death; Lycogenes , his friendship. But what of this Bracelet? or whither should Timonides be sent to him? He could scarce beleeue he read such a Letter, or that hee was fully awake. When after a little pause he had recollected himselfe, he againe reading ouer the Letter; Some great matter, saith hee, is now in hand, takes such care of mee: if he had liued that brought this Letter, somewhat perhaps might haue beene gotten out of him, to haue giuen vs light in so much darknesse. For, what I should thinke, or by what meanes I may come to the truth, is vncertaine. With that, he thinkes with himselfe, whether it were to be beleeued, that Meleander , vnder shew of friendship, would wrong the innocent. It was more suteable with Lycogenes his nature, to bely the King, then with the Kings, to vse so detestable a practice. As he was in these & the like thoughts, the day ended, and the night distracted his mind with as disquiet fancies. After diuers opinions, he tooke it to bee his wisest course, to send Gelanorvs into Sicily , with no Letters, saue that of could not be plainlier found out: For, it would exceedingly vexe the King, whether truely or falsly charged, to suffer eyther vnder the infamy of an vnprofitable and vnpreuailing, treachery, or vnder an vniust suspition. Out of his,  & his neerest Councelours speeches and countenances, Gelanorvs might quickly find, what credit should be giuen to Lycogenes his discouery. Neither did he sticke by this to offend Lycogenes , to whom, though This resolution was much forwarded by his desire to write to Argenis , to whom he trusted the bearing of no Letters, saue onely by Gelanorvs and  walkes; her affliction for the losse of a Cabinet that was stolne from her;  , the chiefe Citie of Mauritania ; which, with the pleasantnesse of the situation, drew Poliarchvs somewhat from his sadder cogitations. The Riuer, also called Lixa , so gently mingled it selfe with the vnresisting Sea, that where both the waters met, neither the noise nor the foame made any difference, but onely their colour. Many trees, such as grow neere riuers, on both sides the Channell, with the other fruites growing vpon the banke, seemed with their shades to sport vpon the waters. The Cittie was great, and by the traffique of Marchants, wealthy and populous: It stood, after you were got a little from the Sea, not aboue a furlong from the Riuer. On your right hand, as you passe from the shore to the Citie, was a hill; the pleasantest in all Africa : and on the same a faire Countrey house, which they called the Queenes Mannour. There, whe she was oppressed with cares, would she vsually soiourne: and after some refreshment by solitude taken in turnes, to returne more cheerefully to the trouble and broyle of businesse. And then by chance she was there: Which when it was told Poliarchvs by those that met him in boates, he commanded Anchor to be cast on the next Coast. And, lest his Rowers should make any stirre in his absence, or runne away from him, he demands of the Africans , if there were no Warden of the Port, or who had the charge and custody of the Riuer. The Officers were at hand, and I know not what Farmer of the Customes: to whom Poliarchvs said: I leaue the guard of this Barge (which it neerely concernes Africa to be kept safe) with you, while I carry matter of importance to the Queene, which it is most fit she should know from my selfe. And withall taking out the Pirates, he caused their bolts to be taken off their feete, and put vpon their neckes, and puts the string, fastened to all their bolts, into the Master of the Barge his hand, and sends him with them before him vp the hill. He followes himselfe with Gelanorvs , viewing with a curious eye the forme of the place, which the late horrour of the Sea made the more pleasing. The beauty of it was not caused by laborious Art: there was more owing to Nature, whose owne facility and inclination had preuented the labour of the most skilfull Artizan. The rough ascent to the house, (neither would the Queene haue it plained) had giuen such an oblique side to the hill, as it rather seemed to wind about it, than to goe vpright to the top. Many thicke shrubs, most pleasant with the variety of the greenenesse of their branches, shaddowed the left side of the way. There were small hillocks vpon an easie-rising plaine, till the long head of the Mountaine, shaddowed with his many trees, rose with a suddain swelling. On the right, were to be seene the valleyes, full of vineyards and gardens; and at the foot of the hill, halfe way about it, the green meadowes, rich in feeding, stretched out themselues with like pleasantnesse. A little vnder the highest toppe, was a high and euen Plaine, on which they had built the House. When you come to the Gates, you haue a different forme of the place, and a freer prospect to delight you. For, before the outer Gate was a spacious and faire piece of ground, for men and Coaches; wherein were growing in rankes, not many, but huge trees, vnder whose shades the soldiers and warders had placed seates, and marble Tables. And as this place was very high, it shewed the windings of the Riuer vnderneath it, and other Hilles ouer against it, with diuers Noble-mens houses vpon them. From the right side of the house, might be seene the chiefe part of the Citie, mounted by little ascents, and the high structure of the Churches. If you send your eye a little further, the Mountaine Atlas with his winters coate and barren Rocks, broken among the Cloudes into many tops, with the change of the sight he delights his mind,  & through the imagination of that rough place, more sweetly comends the neighbour happines. The house it selfe, for a Queenes Court, was not great. But for one thing it was beholding to the work-man, that what wind soeuer blew, it cooled the Summers heate; and the fairest roomes tooke in full light, yet not subiect to the Sunnes scorching beames. A small garden there was, and stretched in length, worthy to be a Mansion for the Muses and all the gods, that first tooke care of planting and sowing: into which, from the house there was a Gallery, adorned with Statues and Pictures, where the Queene vsed to feast. Now the top of the Mountaine adioyning not onely to the Garden, but to the House and the Groue, deuided onely by a wall, shut vp the left side of the Garden. This side was beautified with a pleasant Fountaine, running out of the truncke of a marble Elephant, into a channell of Chequer worke. But the right side was left empty for prospect, onely compassed with a low wall, to preuent falling downe the steepe hill, leaning whereon, you might haue the full sight of the Parke vnderneath. For, there was a little pond rounded with a bricke wall, wherein were fishes of all sorts of growth, to which the Queene tooke often pleasure to throw bread out of her garden into the water, and see them striue one with another for the bait. A posterne gate led out of the Garden into the Groue, parted with hands into seuerall paths, finely pruned and trimmed from the out-growing sprigges. Here were Harts, Ro-buckes, and other beasts which that Countrey neuer bred, that were brought out of forraigne parts into Africa . And these Verses, consecrating the Groue to Diana , stood heere grauen in Numidian Marble:  Chaste Queene of night, that now o're craggy grounds Follow'st the Chase, now with thy shafts deal'st wounds, Whether on fearefull Deere, or game more high, And from thy darts our Lybian Lions flie. Goddesse of woods; if thee and thy chaste traine, This House and holy groues may entertaine; Oh, heare vs gently, and accept thine owne. Let heere no Fawnes lasciuious sports be known, These vntoucht woods to thy chaste honour'd name We consecrate; great Queene, accept the same. And when along the fields the foaming Boare We chase into the toyle: or when w'adore Thy shrine, be seene by vs: or if wee pray Too much t'obtaine, be with vs any way. Let thy swift Dogges still make their courses heere, And with their sacred yelping glow our eares. Heere the Wood-Nymphes, and Mountaine Fayeries Dance, still attending thee. And when you please, Take shade, or bathe your limbes: or rest you there, Where the cold waters their natiue Tophus weare. Or if, too hot, you lay your garments by, In this close Fount shall no Acteon pry, To deserue Hornes, nor shall Orion here Deserue the Scorpions deadly wounding Speare. Nor taking heere thy Quiuer, and thy shape, Shall Iove the Skie fill with another rape. Onely, Diana , be thou pleas'd to count This, as thy Dele , or Lycia's snowy Mount. Not Pindus , nor Eurotas more frequent. When any of thy Nymphes her yeeres has spent, And seekes another forme; whether it bee Spreading her armes, like boughes, to stand a tree, Lawrell, or Oake; heere, Cynthia , let it bee, Growing with these. Erisichthons sad fate, Be hence. This wood let no axe violate. It were tedious to speake of all; how Nature had made selfe sport in the vnlikenesse of places; how in a little compasse she represented all the various shapes, wherein whole Regions differ one from another: How the harmlesse winter had not changed the Groue, being almost all of it full of Orange trees, with the Rose-flowre tree, the Bay tree, the Pine tree, the Corke: and the hollow Caues, some of themselues, some opened by man, freely yeeld cleere Fountaines, or coole shades: But one Fountaine there was most remarkable, so of purpose contriued, as what was Artificiall, seemed naturall. For the Hill being cut out in the fashion of a halfe moone, had a little Plaine, thinne couered with small pebles, as it were, carelessely layed: but at each side they had placed huge stones, like naturall Rockes. When this worke was growne twelue foot high, they made a narrow path, by which you might easily goe about the place. Then vpon the toppe of this Structure they planted trees in a round compasse, in such sort, as the toppes of the bowing branches hung ouer the yard below. These trees, when they were growne big, made shew as if they were falling, and with their own burden plucking out themselues by the rootes. Amidst these harmlesse threates of ruine, the heate of the Sunne could not pierce the thicke leaues and boughes. So, with a brickwall, the bending of the boughes on this fashion, & the hugenesse of the rising hill, the Queenes innocent sports were more priuate, who, when she was disposed to recreate her selfe, did often frequent the Fountaine there falling through certaine Pipes out of the Mount. It was vnlawfull for men, except the chiefe Magistrates, to enter her house. A few of the Guard stood at Gate, by whom Poliarchvs with his prisoners being commanded to stand backe: they also something rudely questioned him, what he was, and from whence he came? He answered, that his businesse was such as might not be imparted to any but the Queene her selfe. The Captain of the Guard was acquainted herewith, who also himselfe hauing spoken to Poliarchvs , giues the Queene notice, that a Stranger, a young Gentleman, of braue habit and demeanour, that had brought some prisoners with him, desired to be admitted to speake with her. The Queene at this time was retyred hither, not meerely for her recreation, but in this solitude to giue more free vent to her griefe. The cause of her lamentation, was the breaking open of a roome by theeues, wherein, with her Iewels, she had layed vp her neerest and dearest secrets. Neyther did her Iewels, (or any thing else, which was reported to be stolne) trouble her: onely, one little Cabinet, and that not very rich, which the Robbers had taken away with the rest, caused all this sadnesse, and almost brought her to despaire. This Cabinet shee held dearer then her life; wherein, she knew, was the fate of her sonne: neyther did she lesse complaine of the gods, then if she had buried him. When therefore shee was told of the comming of heare with all attention: yet she commanded Micipsa , her high Chamberlaine, to bring him in; she her selfe sitting, among her Ladies standing about her, in an Iuory Chayre, borne vp by siluer Lyons, their maines seeming to be kept downe with the weight. But as soone as he came into her presence, calling her to the remembrance of her absent sonne, (for he was both young and faire) he had affected her with a sudden respect to him: presently, hauing saluted her in most ample manner; Although, O Queene, said he, perhaps the losse of those things little trouble you, which most wicked Theeues haue lately stolne out of your Treasury, yet I conceiued, it would be most acceptable to so iust a Princesse, that they should not escape, after so great a villany, vnpunished. I happened vpon them, by the conduct of the gods, in the maine Sea. Many of them were slaine in the fight. Three haue I brought aliue. Behold, they are at your gate, and await their doome from your mouth. Send but a trusty man with mee, o Queene, and to him will I restore, whatsoeuer they haue taken from you, yet, as they tell mee, vntouched. I haue commanded them to be safely kept in my Ship, at the next shore. The Queene, at so great and sudden ioy, after the nature of women, impatient, starts from her Seat, and holding the Stranger fast by the hand: Oh thou most blessed aboue all mortall men, quoth shee! or rather, if this be true, worthy to be equally honoured with our gods! leade mee straight to your Ship. I shall best know the things stolne; I shall find out their prey. Nor call mee couetous; restore mee onely one little Cabinet; the rest I freely bestow vpon you. So speaking, shee leades the way to Poliarchvs ; who wondred at her eagernesse. Neyther would she stay the making ready her Coach, nor the taking vp of her Litter. As shee was, in her priuate habit, she hastes forward, in a matter of so great moment, trusting onely her selfe. The Ladies and Maides that attended her, without staying to change any Garment, went on foot. The stirre at their haste made it shew like a flight. And when Poliarchvs shewed the Queene the theeues before the gate: Suffer mee, I pray you, said shee, before I condemne others, to know, whether Fortune hath deliuered my selfe. There was none in the Court, but made haste after her. Most of them that knew not the matter, stood amazed, and were the cause of amazement to others. Newes was presently brought to the City, but vncertaine, and therefore further spred. Some said, the Queenes Sonne was come; some, that his dead body was brought in the Ship, others said trulier, that the Queene was gone to recouer her stolne treasure: And euery one makes with all speed to the Riuer; the common Rowt being prepared eyther for mirth or mourning. The Queene, when as she came to the shore, was brought to the Barge vpon a Bridge of plankes. And as soone, as a huge Chest, vnlocked by Poliarchvs , had shewed the prey, now shedding teares of ioy, and imbracing the little Cabinet she sought, she cryed aloud, that now she liued againe; now, she was a Queene againe: neyther was any thing more fit, then that Poliarchvs should be honoured as a god. Poliarchvs , with a modest smile, refused it, and stopt her in her prayses of him. By this time, the Litters, which followed her as fast as they could, stayed on the shore, with Coaches to carry the Ladies: and she esteeming her Mannour much too narrow to entertayne so great a ioy and happinesse, commanded her seruants to prepare for her returne into the City. She leaned vpon Poliarchvs , (which with Queenes is the highest honour,) and, being led by him, shee betooke her to her Litter, which presently eight Groomes tooke vp vpon their shoulders. In the meane time, Poliarchvs mounted the Horse made ready for him, which they had brought out of the Queenes Stable; not (after that Countrey manner) vncouered, but with such ornaments as their Kings vsed in warre, or hunting. All the whole iourney, the Queene, putting by the Curtaines of the Litter, held discourse with him, thorow the thicke prease of the Africans , who all the way held their eyes on him. After they came to the Court, the Noble men, by the Queenes command, brought her Guest to his lodging. Being there most magnificently entertained, hee is left alone with Gelanorvs , to take his best repose.  in refusing the Presents of Queene Hianisbe .  his owne prayses, he instantly returned to his former cares, and seriously pondering his affaires in Sicily , hee resolued that euening to send from Lycogenes admit any delay.) He himselfe would stay at Clupea , a Sea-towne in Africke , till his Messenger returned from Argenis . Whilest therefore he was a writing to Argenis , he causes the Pylote to be called, that had brought him thither: who being brought in; Thy Barke, quoth hee, I doe not onely freely giue thee, but will further restore thee, whatsoeuer the Pirates tooke from thee, vpon this condition, that thou transport my seruant Gelanorvs into Sicily , and from thence bring him back againe into what Port of Africa he shall please. At your returne, thy pay shall be ready. Now I onely furnish thee with necessaries for the voyage. Of those Rowers and captiues, choose such as you know, and as many as you need: I will see, they shall not repent their labour. Amongst the rest I will distribute a talent, that they be not shamed with their beggery at their returne into their Countries. The Master calling him his Lord and Patron, stood amazed at the greatnesse of his bounty, and promising his best forwardnesse, was sent away to make ready the Barge against that night. And while hee was reporting this ioyfull newes to the Saylers, they were so ouer-ioyed, as hee was in danger, with their rude imbraces, to haue beene pluckt in pieces. The euening came on, when the chiefe of the Nobility came in to Poliarchvs from the Queene, fayling in no poynt of cheerefull intertainement. From them, amongst other by-conference, hee learned thus much in effect touching the Queenes affaires; That she was called Hyanisbe : that she had succeeded her brother Ivba three and twenty yeeres agoe in the Kingdome: that before she was Queene, she was marryed to one Syphax , the chiefe man in Mauritania , next to the King, who dying of a sicknesse, when King Ivba dyed, had left her with childe: that the Queene not long after was deliuered of a Sonne, whom she called Hyempsal , who, by the fauour of the gods, had by his owne towardlinesse farre out-gone euen the wishes of his Subiects: but that now in quest of honour amongst strangers, he was in priuate habit trauelled, none, but the Queene, knowing into what Countrey. The Mauritanians acquainting him with these passages, did couertly againe seeke to get from him, what hee was, and from whence, or whither his iourney lay. But hee shifted off these busie questioners, with like cunning, as not perceiuing them. Afterwards, being inuited to sup with the Queene, he spent a great part of the euening with her, with little lesse obseruance from all men, then if hee had come in Purple. Supper ended, and he hauing taken his leaue of the Queene, as meaning to depart the next morning, and come backe to his lodging; there came in some instantly, which couered the Table richer than before. There were Iewels, some in Chaines, some in Bracelets, and Eare-rings, great store of ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   Precious Pearles so called.  ] Vnions, and (the little Cabinet onely excepted) more than he had recouered from the Pyrates. These did the Queene, eyther as a reward of his deseruing, or a pledge of his intertainement, present to Poliarchvs . But hee being vsed neyther to sell a benefit, nor to be bought with gifts, much commending the Queenes humanity, denyed so great rewards to bee due for so little paynes; and besides, they became not a Souldier. They should therefore carry backe these so many Presents to the Queene, together with his excuse and his thankes. Yet lest he might be condemned of obstinate pride, hee tooke vp a Ring set with an Emerald, and putting it on his finger, vowed to keepe it as his hand: for so had the giuer deserued. It was an enammelled Ring, and in the Stone was his face, in such manner, as himselfe seemed to looke aside, for feare of receyuing the Stone into his owne bowels. But Atlas was fashioned as disdayning to be changed: his hayre grew stiffer into a young wood: and his visage shewed him now no more a man, and not yet a Mountaine. In the meane time comes the Master, and told him, the winde stood fayre. If Gelanorvs made haste, they might within few houres leaue Africa farre behinde them. Poliarchvs therefore quickly dispatches him away, with priuate instructions, what he should deliuer to Meleander , what he should say to Argenis : what Selenissa, Archombrotvs , and the rest of his friends, were to be acquainted with. Also, how the King had disposed of his goods: and that hee should learne, whether they were confiscate, and who were the buyers. For, from hence might be gathered, how Meleander stood affected to him. After he had performed this charge in Sicily , he should returne to Clupea with all possible speed, where he was determined to stay for him.  Of Poliarchvs his sicknesse. Gelanorvs arriueth in Sicily ; hee visiteth Antenor ; encountreth with Nicopompvs , and Hieroleander, Argenis her Secretary, hee heareth of the death of Aldina , Poliarchvs his Bitch.  hee, being very weary, betakes himselfe to his rest. But when he was in Bed, and his spirits at liberty, which the thought of seuerall affaires had before busied, then the wounds, which the Pyrate had giuen him on the side, being not onely neglected, but angred with violent exercise and disquiet of his minde, with a sudden heat and trembling, put him into a burning Feuer. This mischance deferred his iourney which he intended on the next day, and affrighted the Queene, no lesse, then if her owne sonne had beene in like case. For, besides the mighty benefit, which shee had receiued of Poliarchvs , the proofe of his vertue, his temperate language, nay more, the opinion of his great parentage, and I know not what sway of her presaging minde, had inforced her to beare him most true and hearty affection. The next morning therefore early shee visits him, and brings him her Physicions: the Noble men following the Queene, had in their faces the semblance of sorrow. Sicily . But although the winde serued him fitly to put in at Eipercte , yet he refrayned from that harbour, and landed at an obscure Port, of purpose, lest any of the Saylers that brought him thither, might be knowne, or questioned touching Poliarchvs . He went to the Temple of Apollo , not farre from the shore towards Panormus , more renowned for the fame of the Priest, than of his god. The Priest was called Antenorivs , free from cares in his old age,  & happy to his owne wish. For, where in his youth he had easily atchieued great honours, and was worthy, in the opinion of all his friends, to obtaine the chiefest places and offices; being warned by the fall of many, what a misery it was to be carryed with ambitious desires, hee lookes backe to the libertie of the minde, and not struggling with his owne naturall disposition, chose the Temple of Apollo to grow old in. For, hee loued to serue that god, and had often inuoked him, and enioyed him: so strongly armed against all chances, that, whether hee or his friends were in trouble, hee was alwaies conquerour, through his most constant cheerefulnesse. He was infinitely learned, and of a sharpe and quicke wit: all which, his integrity of life did more exceedingly comend in so pleasant an old man. And he loued Poliarchvs , and durst praise him, being not yet publiquely restored. And Gelanorvs , well knowing him to be a most sincere man, turned out of the way to him, and found him lying in the entry of his Temple, (for, hee was lame) amongst his Bookes, as his manner was, and wisely and cheerefully discoursing with his friends. While they were yet in their first complement, Nicopompvs interrupts them with a new ioy. Hee was an inward friend with Antenorivs , and being full of the cares and broyles at Court, sought by discourse with this sweet old man, so long at least to forget the troubles of the Commonwealth. come then, Gelanorvs ? and oh! the gods grant, Poliarchvs be not farre off. Though none were now present but Antenorivs and Nicopompvs , (for, Antenorivs had commanded the rest away) yet Gelanorvs thought it not fit to discouer his Masters secrets and chances to any one, before himselfe was sent by him to the King from the Port of Bai ae . While they were in this talke, lo, how Fortune increased this dayes mirth! Secretary to Argenis , of singular vertues, learned aboue most men: neyther was hee (excepting his fortune) inferiour to his Vnkle, who by his worth had worne the Robes of Priest-hood. Hee came often to this Temple for vp her prayers to Apollo . But when he saw Gelanorvs , and had satisfied himselfe with often imbraces, vpon a light occasion hee vnawares gaue him way to the inquiring of those things, about which came into Sicily , complayning, with his eyes swolne with griefe, that Aldina was dead: whether hee this prepared to excuse himselfe, that hee had her at all, or that hee had so ill looked to her. Gelanorvs somewhat touched at the name of Aldina , look't vpon Hieroleander . It was a most delicate little Bitch; and Poliarchvs had taken much delight in her. After Poliarchvs his going out of Sicily , Hieroleander , by the direction of Argenis , had sought her out, and kept her very carefully: Argenis her selfe not daring to succeed in the hauing of her, lest she should seeme to vse any of the spoyles of Poliarchvs ill, or that on the contrary part shee might be suspected to loue the Bitch for her absent Masters sake: She was then lately dead in whelping, to the great, but secret griefe of Argenis . But impatiently; so that for his sake she began to be famous through the Court, and chiefly by the Verses of many Poets, who, to please him, had bestowed all their Muses, and all the boughes and leaues in Parnassus , vpon the Bitches funerall. But now Gelanorvs conceiued, that this mention of her death (though hee could rather haue wished her aliue) did make much for his purpose: for, from hence might he take occasion to inquire, what Poliarchvs had giuen him in charge; namely, to whose hands his goods, and, as it were, his spoyles were come. But after hee vnderstood, that there were Ouer-seers appoynted by the King ouer the house, who were to keepe it for his Master, and that Aldina onely was caught, that shee might be the better looked vnto, hee thought all went according to his wish. For, in that Aldina had liued in Argenis her owne house, he rightly guessed, that that was in memory of Poliarchvs . And when hee heard, that Argenis was so sad for her death, well satisfied touching the cause of her kindnesse and griefe, hee hearkened to prayses, made by himselfe vpon the dead Bitch in these Verses:  Shee's dead. This beautious Bitche's obsequies Destroy'd by Fate vntimely, solemnize. His light, and fill th'amazed Starres with feares. Hee can lament, remembring well the woe, His Mistris at her Father's graue did show. Too cruell Venvs , whom Aldina's groanes In trauell, moou'd not: nor her Master's moanes. Perchance, 'cause none to Phoebvs is more deare; Thou, as his darling, must her enuy beare: And, wanting power on thee to wreak her hate, The vengefull goddesse wrought Aldina's fate. Yee Papers, mourne; which from her Master's hand This wanton Bitch in play was wont to rend. Yee Chambers mourne, whose softly-trampled floores Shee grac'd: and fled, though sought, forbidden doores. Mourne, yee forsaken couches, chimneys, beds, And what ere's widdowed, since Aldina's dead. Onely, yee Snowes, reioyce: Whiter then you, (Since shee is dead) the World does nothing view.  of this Booke.  heard of his Masters houshold-stuffe, and euen of Aldina , should seeme to trouble his minde, or put any ominous thoughts in his head, turnes to other discourse: I am glad, my friends, said he, that Sicily is in that state, as there is leisure so to grieue or write for a poore Bitch. From hence, I guesse, you are now free from your former broyles and ciuill dissension. Nay, answered Nicopompvs , this is but a truce, wherewith sometimes we beguile our common griefes, that we may gather more strength to beare the burdens imposed by the Fates. But then Gelanorvs more freely asked, Whether by fresh practices had growne worse? They all replyed, that all things were vncertaine. Eristhenes and Olo odemvs were in prison: Lycogenes vp in armes: and the people disobedient to the Prince, to both their ruines. Then Nicopompvs , whether more eager with the heat of youth, or whether the often sight of so many mischiefes at Court, had filled him with indignation, began with many words to accuse not onely Fortune, but the King also and Lycogenes . How long shall our passions stand for reason? and wee by our Ancestors, and our owne successes, neuer measure our counsels and designes? How much better had it beene (I speake the plainlier amongst my friends) for the King to looke backe vpon his Ancestors, and to preuent mischiefes by the example eyther of their wiser resolutions, or their errours, then after the wound receiued, to stand in need of physicke? But these Traytors now vp against him, what title, what colour will they finde for their Rebellion, which hath not beene long before infamous by the like troubles? Let them boast at their pleasures, sometimes, that they doe it for the support of the falling Common-wealth: sometimes, that they will shew to Kings the true worship of the gods. The gods so oft neglected, will not auow so irreligious Armes: and their Countrey so stayned with bloud and ruine, acknowledge their helpe: with what shew soeuer they labour to defend and set forth their wickednesse, it is long agoe since other Rebels haue stained the same. The gods, me thinkes, are filling me with I know not what braue inspiration, to detest these turbulent spirits, to fight against the offenders,  & take reuenge of the. And that you may not thinke this work aboue my strength, the same gods haue also giuen the armour of learning, by which the wounds once giuen, so they be guided with moderation & truth, cannot be resisted with strength, nor forgotten by time. I will at length credit this inforcement of the gods, & freely vse a sharpe Stile: I will discouer, how the King hath done amisse: and what anchor the history of former times doth yet offer him in his now neere ship-wrack. Then will I take off the maske from the factious subiects, that the people may know them: what they are like to hope, what to feare: by what meanes they may be reclaymed to vertue, and by what meanes continuing obstinate, they may be cut off. Neyther will I hide from the people the folly of their owne credulity; no, though you, my deare Antenorivs , should perswade mee. Yea, but (said the Priest, and often shaking his head, smiled heartily) if you will heare mee, you shall bridle this fury. To what purpose, or to whom will you write thus? Will you take this course to aduise the King? Yes, if thou did it priuately. But now, what a fine manner of aduising were this; for you, to publish by writing, in what you thought the King were too blame? and in case you haue marked any thing more in his life, then the common people, you should adde that to the too ill opinion they haue already of him? What worse harme could Lycogenes wish him? Nay, in that you are knowne his friend, you would haue more beleeuers, and this way wrong him more than all his enemies. But you will, forsooth, vnmaske the vices of the factious men, which the people desire to read. You will, out of the successe of former times, enter into their counsels, and presage their destructions. As if they would be frighted with your ominous threatnings: and such as regard not the gods, and are stirred vp to Armes with hope, and villany, would be quieted with your Philosophy. But spare your paines, Nicopompvs . It is long since that this kinde of wisdome grew stale. They are not ignorant that they are faulty: neyther will they amend with warning. But suppose you should write some such documents of powerfull wisdome, as might asswage the fury of the Readers, as some diseases are cured by Musicke; yet how many, thinke you, will finde leisure to reade it? You shall be read by such onely, who being growne shamelesse, through their continuall enuy, thinke any thing learnedly done, wherein the chiefe men are abused with rayling language: or perchance by some obscure fellowes in the Schooles, who being secluded from dealing in publique affaires, vse to take rules and precepts of well-gouerning a Common-wealth onely out of their Bookes. Will you write to these? Shall your chiefe commendations come from these, Nicopompvs ? I say nothing of the danger you incurre by this liberty. Euen those, whom you thinke most to benefit by such admonition, will most hate you, as the Author of their infamy. words would strike mee with a iust feare, said he, diuinest of Prophets, if I had purpose onely to rayle, and were blowne vp with the Plebeian and now too common vanity of rash and vnseasonable censure. Who does not yet remember the impiety of the late Poet, who hauing prouoked his Prince with most contumelious. Libels, had the Gallowes for a reward of his villany, and got a fame by his punishment, which hee sought by his wickednesse? I omit others, who lighther offending, or publishing their foolish wisdome, finde punishment enough in the neglect and scorne of the wise. My purpose, my good brought to take their medicines? When they see the Physician with the cup, they will none of that health, that is to be got with bitter potions. But those which haue the keeping of them, eyther qualifie the bitternesse with sweeter iuyces, or win them by gifts, or flattering them with the fairenesse of the Cup, suffer them not to see or know, what they are to take. So will I, not with suddaine and sharp accusation, call all them to the Barre, as guilty men, which trouble the Common-wealth: I should not be able to stand their hatred. But I will circumuent them vnawares, with such delightfull circumstances, as euen themselues shall be pleased in being taxed vnder strange names. would gladly knowe the manner of this neate inuention. Then thus, said hee, I will compile some stately Fable, in manner of a History: in it will I fold vp strange euents; and mingle together Armes, Marriages, Bloodshed, Mirth, with many and various successes. The Readers will be delighted with the vanities there shewne incident to mortall men: and I shall haue them more willing to reade mee, when they shall not find mee seuere, or giuing precepts. I will feed their minds with diuers contemplations, and as it were, with a Map of places. Then will I with the shew of danger stirre vp pitty, feare, and horrour: and by and by cheere vp all doubts, and graciously allay the tempests. Whom I please, I will deliuer, and whom I please, giue vp to the Fates. I know the disposition of our Countrey-men: because I seeme to tell them Tales, I shall haue them all: they will loue my Booke aboue any Stage- play, or spectacle on the Theater. So first, bringing them in loue with the potion, I will after put in wholsome hearbes: I will figure vices, and vertues; and each of them shall haue his reward. While they reade, while they are affected with anger or fauour, at it were against strangers, they shall meete with themselues; and finde in the glasse held before them, the shew and merit of their owne fame. It will perchance make them ashamed longer to play those parts vpon the stage of this life, for which they must confesse themselues iustly taxed in a fable. And that they may not say, they are traduced; no mans Character shall be simply set downe: I shall finde many things to conceale them, which would not well agree with them, if they were made knowne. For, I, that binde not my selfe religiously to the writing of a true History, may take this liberty. So shall the vices, not the men, be struck: neither can any man take exceptions, but such as shall with a most shamefull confession discouer his owne naughtinesse. Besides, I will haue heere and there imaginary names, to signifie seuerall vices and vertues; so that he may be as much deceiued, that would draw all in my writing, as he that would nothing, to the truth of any late or present passage of State. rubbing both his hands, said, Bestow, I pray you, this paines vpon the Common- wealth: you are bound to it, if you respect either your selfe, or this age. Such a Booke would weare out many ages, and make his Author glorious to all posterity, besides the infinite profit, in laying open and confounding the fraudes and practices of the wicked, and arming Honesty against them. you approue this vehement heate of mine. I will goe forward vpon your warrant. While my matter is fresly, and my mind yet on fire, in straine not vnlike a Poets rapture, I will let fly my rais'd conceit, and weaue a fabulous Storie. Neither will I leaue thee out, Gelanorvs , nor Poliarchvs . So speaking, lest the heate should coole, which the gods fired him with to writing, as soon as he was got to his lodging, scarce allowing himselfe time for supper, he call'd for paper, and euen then begun his most vsefull and delightfull Story.  Author of the poyson; the examination of Eristhenes and Olo odemvs , their guiltinesse and death.  his friend, and a heauy enemy to Lycogenes ? The next day, , who was to stay longer with Antenorivs in the Temple: hee, with telling Argenis , that Apollo out of the happy entrailes had promised all prosperous successe; he added, that he had met with Poliarchvs his seruant at the Temple Gate,  & that he was now in the Citie; little knowing how much the Ladies thoughts would be troubled with this newes. She quickly apprehended, that the gods, by their prosperous Auguries at the Sacrifice, approued the comming of Gelanorvs : yet suddenly one doubt abated somewhat of her gladnesse; Whether Gelanorvs was come without Poliarchvs ; or rather, whether hee concealed himselfe, seeking meanes to speake with her by stealth. She had hope to heare from Gelanorvs , at least, where he was, how he did, what he would haue her to doe, or what himselfe was about. No lesse desire had Gelanorvs to meete with the Lady: but as hee happened vpon Evrymedes by chance, and could not conceale his being sent to the King; being presently brought to him, with a countenance, as became him, neither too low, nor too lofty, said briefely thus; Poliarchvs ,  o King, wisheth you health, and hath purposely sent these Letters, written to him by or to giue credit to what is reported of your intent towards him. And withall he deliuers him the Epistle; which the King reading ouer, and much perplexed with the new and infamous aspersion, sends for Cleobvlvs and Evrymedes , and with them communicates the Letter: neither did they otherwise reply, than that it was some darke businesse, and full of danger. There was neuer any thing so doubtfull; especially, when Gelanorvs himselfe, first assayed with requests, and afterwards, in a manner, with threates, did not discouer any thing, (neither could he indeed) whereby Lycogenes his treachery might be found out. He told them, as the truth was, that this Letter was found amongst the spoiles of one that was slaine; and neither he nor Poliarchvs knew anything more. Neither do I, Gelanorvs , said the King, see any light in this mist. Argenis by my command sent a Bracelet to Poliarchvs : and Timonides appointed to carry it: But neither know I any thing of the poyson; nor can I guesse how Lycogenes should come to know of the Bracelet. Keepe you the businesse close to your selfe, that none know what newes you haue brought me. It shall be the gods care and mine, to bring to light the secret wickednesse of our enemies. Then, asking Gelanorvs , where hee had left Poliarchvs and Timonides ; he denyed that Timonides or the Bracelet euer came to and downe vpon diuers Coasts. After he was dismissed from the Kings presence, he went to Selenissa ; and, when he saw his time, deliuering the Letter to Argenis , he also discoursed vnto her, what Poliarchvs had giuen him in charge: That hee was in Africa , and there would stay, till shee had resolued of some course, which might be auaileable for them both. If there were need of forces, he would not come alone, and as a priuate man into Sicily : or if she could thinke of any more conuenient way, that she should not spare to command him, as she thought fit: and that in the meane time she would not suffer the memory of their vowed loue to be blotted out with absence That withall, it would bee no small pledge of her loue, to let him vnderstand, whether Lycogenes had cause to giue him that warning, or no. Argenis , much troubled at sweares, no such thing had proceeded fro her Father:  & that Poliarchvs was much too blame, that he could suspect, that if the King should goe about any such thing, she should be more backward than Lycogenes , either to find it out, or giue him notice of it. But when Gelanorvs discoursed of found safety amongst the shelues: how, after that, he was neerer his death amongst the Pirates, then in the ship-wracke; shee, not able to beare the conceit of so great a danger, willing him sometimes to hold his peace, and presently againe to speake, trembled at euery word, as if shee had heard of some present distresse, not yet passed. And now, the King being exceedingly pensiue, euer thinking of the Bracelet, of when Arsidas and Timonides came to the Court, with newes, as they beleeued, of Poliarchvs his ship-wracke. Therefore it was, that imagining sight of him liuing; and were suddenly sent for by the King, that if they could say any thing to this Letter of Lycogenes , they might be heard. beginning to speake what they had done, first of all shewed forth the boxe, and in it the Bracelet, the occasion of all these broyles. They sayd, said they, by probable arguments deceiued, had bewailed him, as cast away at Sea; when Gelanorvs heere putting vs into better comfort, assured vs, his Master liued and was in health. The King then deliuers them Lycogenes his Letters to Poliarchvs ; at which while they were astonished, Cleobvlvs searching into all things with a deeper reach; Let vs see, quoth hee, whether the Bracelet be vn-infected, and sufficiently disproue the Lye by the harmlesse Quilt; or whether it beeing poysoned, gaue matter for this accusation. While they handle it, while they vnfold the stiches, they presently obserue the poyson, of a different colour from the rest, with small greenish spots heere and there in the Silke, to which with Siluer threads the Iewels were fastened. Which seeing, What is this, said Cleobvlvs , but the poyson which Lycogenes writes of? But let vs examine, by whose fault this Present is become so deadly. Neuer let mee ( o King) be beleeued vpon coniecture, if this Treason belong not to Lycogenes and his Confederates. For, Eristhenes your Treasurer, whom you haue now in hold, had this Bracelet in his custody: and why may you not imagine, but that they, either by their owne inquisitiuenesse, or by some of your owne seruants Treason, might come to know, that this was intended as a gift to Poliarchvs ; and so, by poysoning the Bracelet, seeke to take away both his life, and your honour? But by the fauour of the gods all is turned to the best: and the wicked Traitours shall be caught in their owne trap. Olo odemvs and Eristhenes , whom it much concernes you to cut off, you haue in prison, onely vpon suspition; but as yet we haue not had the fortune to charge them with any open act, such as might giue satisfaction to the people. But when it shall once appeare they haue committed this villany, euery man will giue his voice to their condemnation. The King commands Cleobvlvs to make further enquirie about that which he suspected, and to call the prisoners to tryall. He alledging that all things might bee more fitly brought about Evrymedes , giues him briefe instructions, how to manage the businesse. Neither was Evrymedes slack in performing his charge, but goes presently to the prison where Eristhenes was in hold; and from the outside of the doore, (as Cleobvlvs had well directed him) seeming exceeding sad; You haue at last, said he, Eristhenes , triumphed ouer Poliarchvs : Hee is dead of the poyson, which you infected the Bracelet with. But will you, as mischiefe? At this, Eristhenes , ouerwhelmed with a suddaine torrent of passion, had not what to say. He heard, Poliarchvs was dead; which his own wishes to haue it so, made him easily beleeue. But now was his conscience pricked, being charged with so heynous a crime. And why should he further dissemble, if Olo odemvs (for so had Evrymedes made shew) had confessed the poyson? Neither had he time for further deliberation or aduice. As in desperate courses therefore, he thought he had no way left him, but to stand to it, and nor dully to linger: or in vaine denying the fact, he should appeare to acknowledge it to bee a shamefull thing, that he was so vnwilling to confesse. And therefore, as Evrymedes vrged him to speake; It is well, quoth hee: let the Fates doe with mee as they please: I haue ioy enough, to ouerliue Poliarchvs the enemy of Sicily . So, Evrymedes , as taking the matter granted, cunningly diued into their counsels. At last he vpbraides him with the treachery of Lycogenes , who in his Letter to Poliarchvs , had laid the infamy of his own villany vpon the innocent King: which the King, and not without much horrour, shewes him what he had confessed: and that now nothing wanted, saue onely that Olo odemvs should by the like confession condemne himselfe. care, and sends him to Olo odemvs . But he, of a quicker apprehension, as detesting the name of poyson, when he was questioned, asked more questions himselfe. And when he was told, that Eristhenes had confessed it, thinking that to bee but a tricke, he answered, that neither did he beleeue, were, that himselfe had any hand in it. At length Evrymedes vanquished his obstinacy by this policy. Hee places Olo odemvs in a secret place, from whence he might heare Eristhenes , with whom himselfe begun againe to renew the former conference betweene them: and Eristhenes , as in pledge of his constancy, neither denyed his own, nor his Confederates offences; vntill he had so much conquered Olo odemvs his patience, as he suddenly exclaimed; Oh friends! Then, drawing the Curtaines, he calls him The common ruine of his friends; and tells him, hee alone was worthy of that wretched end which hee had brought vpon all of them. Eristhenes did now too late perceiue himselfe to bee deluded by Evrymedes , and that Olo odemvs had before confessed nothing of this Treason: hee therefore, with such words as the time and his griefe would giue him leaue, excused his errour to Olo odemvs . But now that the businesse was sufficiently disclosed, and compleat witnesses had heard them, they were shut vp againe in seuerall prisons, and the day after brought to open tryall; lest, if the people should not bee at their Arraignement, it should be traduced by the power and faction of the prisoners friends, as against the Law. But although the King assured himselfe of the fidelity of the Citizens of Eipercte ; yet was a guard of armed men placed neere the Iudgement seate, for the safe keeping of the Prisoners; and their tryall was appointed to be in such a place, as they might (if there should happen any stirre) be easily returned to the Castle to prison. The people, called by a Cryer, came in great number thronging to the Iudgement seate; and the Kings Aduocate spoke to this purpose: That the people well knew, how dearely the King loued them, and the King, againe, made no doubt of their affection and fidelity towards him: and therefore, though he might of his owne Royall power proceed to the condemnation of Olo odemvs and ouer to the publique Iudges, that hee might especially take reuenge of them, by the voyces of his louing Citizens. The people should heare them speake for themselues, and giue their opinions before the Iudges, what was to bee done with them. At that time did thirtie Iudges sit vpon life and death; before whom Olo odemvs and Eristhenes beeing brought, the Aduocate did, point by point, lay open their many heynous offences against the King, their faith often broken, and their confederacy with the Kings enemies: But he dwelt longer, and with much more bitternesse, vpon the matter of the poyson, and the infamous aspersion cast vpon the King. And when he had produced their confession, the witnesses, and their owne letters; he so incensed the Eiperctanes , as not staying for Iudgement, the most of them did most eagerly vrge to haue them stoned to death. But the Aduocate intreated the people to forbeare their violence, till the Iudges had giuen sentence. It was very necessary that the Offenders should answer openly: for they would more hurt themselues by their own speech,  & guilt of their conscience, than he could by any accusation. And the King, if they would demand it, had granted the the double water. With this, he vrges the prisoners to speake for theselues. But they (as he before had guessed) in so bad a cause had nothing to say. The crime could not be auoyded, nor the people appeased. Some few words therefore they faintly spoke; and those more against the King, then for themselues. Then the Iudges put their suffrages into the Vrne, which being openly broken vp, all the beanes being blacke, condemned the Traitours to death. They were presently carried backe to prison, that being conuicted of poysoning, they might worthily dye by poyson themselues. There, with their last and sad liberty, they made vse of that licence which the Law had giuen to men that were so to dye. They therefore breathed out curses against the King, called vpon Lycogenes to reuenge their deaths; and besought the infernall gods, that their enemies reserued for worser ends, might liue to enuy their deaths. And now the fatall Cup was brought them, which Olo odemvs first snatching out of the Executioners hand, Go to, sayes hee, let vs drinke to Meleander : we are now parting from our miseries, and shall worse oppresse him by our deaths, then hee could imagine we would haue done liuing. So saying, without staying further, hee drunke it off. When it was filled againe, and offered to said hee, tell my friends, what they owe to Meleander ? The poyson drunke off, they were both willed by the Deaths-man, that, to the end the poyson might be the quicklier dispersed, and they dye with lesse paine, they would keepe themselues walking, as farre as the length of the prison would giue them leaue, vntill they might perceiue their legges to swell, and the heate leauing their lower parts. They tooke his aduice; and by and by, their feete growing cold, they lay downe vpon the bed: there, the poyson working, and a myst, like sleepe, dulling their eyes, they languished without sence; vntill their thighes being now dead, they found, the strong poyson had diffused it selfe into their vitall parts: and not long after, they breathed their last. Verses were quickly spred abroad by the haste of Poets; some of whom did most vnmanly insult ouer the falne wretches; and some gaue them warning, as if they had time to repent, and now too late prophecied of their past destruction. These Lynes gaue lesse offence, as touching more the ambition, than the persons of the offenders.  To thee, Ambition, a iust Sacrifice The Fates haue slaine: Oh, let this blood suffice. Cease now thy rage: grant peace to Sicily. How oft, alas, with this Lands tragedy, Haue thy blacke conquests fill'd the shades below, Whil'st 'tis thy pleasure, Kingdomes t'ouerthrow, And braue the Earth with warres? Foule Periury Leades the first ranke, contempt of Deity, And euer-boundlesse hopes. Then Furies dire Possesse their thoughts, and kindle quenchlesse fire. No sworne Allegeance, Fame, nor Vertue bind Their guilty soules, but that through dangers blind, They runne on mischiefe. Oh, that Mars his rage, Not so much fire and slaughter could asswage! Poore soules should perish, and the weaker Sexe (Warres crime, alas!) Tyranique Lords should vexe. What seeke you with such fury, to despoile Iust power, and barren make your natiue soyle: To spend the weary night in toylesome care? (What rest has vice?) No sooner shall you share Your curst rewards, when vengefull Fates shall call Your soules, your dayes in sudden nights enthrall.  Kings power; but fayling of it, they prepare for warre on both sides.  with a small troupe of Horse, to attempt the surprize of him at vnawares. For not yet broken out into force; standing onely vpon his owne strength, with a guard of Soldiers about him: oftentimes labouring a reconciliation, that he might, by meanes of a Truce, either get the prisoners from the King, or otherwise might haue colour to make the King odious, as a cruell and most implacable Tyrant. And that he might the better be beleeued really to seek for peace, he sollicits Dvnalbivs by Letter, to disswade the King from any rigorous proceeding, and to moue him to set the prisoners at liberty: and what suspition or hatred there was, he should forget it for the publique quietnesse sake. Dvnalbivs , while he makes a shew to giue credit to his Letter, and seemes to negotiate his requests with the King, ouer-reaches Lycogenes with his owne subtilty. For he, in hope of deceiuing the King, and recouering his friends out of prison, was so slow in making preparations, as the King in the meane while had time enough to looke to his own affaires. But at this time, when the King had sent to take him, there wanted not some of his Confederates, who preuented the comming of Evrimedes , bringing him newes of his friends death, and his owne danger. It was then supper time, and hee, accompanied with many military men, his friends; to whom Lycogenes spoke to this effect: That you may not thinke the businesse small, fellow Soldiers, about which you are met; I haue inuited you heere to the Funerall supper for Olo odemvs and Eristhenes . They are slaine by Meleanders cruelty: and vnlesse I haue your helpe, I also shall be cast away in the same storme: Behold, the Tyrants Guard are at my Gates, with charge for my destruction. What will afterwards become of you, what of the best sort of the people, I thinke, no man makes doubt. When he thus boldly slaughters our brauest and chiefest men, can you thinke, he will deale more mercifully vvith the rest? I doe not sollicite you, deare fellowes in Armes, to the defence of mine own safety, vnlesse you perceiue it to be vnseparable from yours. And with these speeches hee leapes from the bed: the rest also, ouerturning the Tables for haste, runne to their weapons. The whole House was in vprore with the speedy diligence of so many Soldiers, all standing in feare of their owne and their Leaders safety. Some were sent to raise more forces from the neighbouring places: many, vnder the leading of Menocritvs , were appoynted to meete Evrymedes , and with an ambush layd in a fit valley, to surprize him at vnawares, being weary with trauell. But the Skirmish was very disorderly, because Evrymedes was come on, though much vn-prepared for fight, before they had layed their ambush: yet was it manfully fought on both sides; especially Evrymedes fretted, that Lycogenes , hauing warning giuen him, could not be surprized. But though he were in the enemies Countrey, and much too weake for him, (for, Lycogenes , vpon report of the Skirmish begun, had drawne thither all his forces,) yet could not endure to make escape by a confessed flight: and so retyring by little and little, Lycogenes did not pursue him with his men; whether he feared some Stratagem from the enemy, or the darknesse of the night hindred him. There were not many slaine in this nights bickering: but Lycogenes seemed to haue the better; who being much cheered at his Soldiers eagernes, sends euery way for his friends, armeth them, as they come, with armour before made ready, and after one fashion writes to the Magistrates of Cities, to giue him their best assistance, as the Author of the publike liberty. And there were many not slow to reuolt from their good and gracious King, that had before growne great vnder his milde gouernement. A good document for mortall men, that what high or excellent vertue soeuer bee in a King, yet vnlesse hee haue the fame of Fortitude, hee shall bee condemned: and that no Princes are more faithfully beloued of their people, then such as haue deserued to be feared. Sicily now offers a sad spectacle to all men: Religion is banished; and the Lawes neglected: the wayes dangerous for Trauellers; houses and streetes euery where afflicted with Rapine, Fire, and Fury: onely the Tents in the forloine Fieldes, shew glorious with bright Armour. Neither were the people in the first rage sensible, how they suffered farre more affliction vnder so many Tyrants, then that which they sought to reuenge vpon Meleander ; betrayers of themselues, and the hyre of their owne treason. Yet were not many carried away with this torrent. Foure Cities, beside Eipercte , were kept in with the awfull reuerence of Maiesty; Messana, Panormus, Catanea , and (in the heart of the Iland) Enna . And now Licogenes vsurping all the rights and marks of a King, forbore onely the name. A chaire of State, when he sate at the Table; a purple Robe in his Tents, and a short Faulchion euery where by his side: Either extremely affable or seuere, that he might so conteyne or terrifie the stubborne Soldier. And Meleander , no lesse vigilant about his affaires, raised at many musters, a great and choice company of men. Eipercte being well stored with victuall and munition, was chosen for the chiefe seate of the warre. Into that Port were brought as many of the Kings Gallies as had continued in their loyalty. The King himselfe, both of his owne natuer, and especially now in this vncertainty of his estate, was most intentiue to the seruice of the gods; and because this wicked Rebellion did, like a disease, ouer-spread all Sicily ; as if he rather ascribed their fault to the Fates, or to madnesse, than to their malice. By this meanes he hoped to recouer their affections, whom their rash fury had carried away. And lest the infection should creepe in amongst his own soldiers, he would with sacrifices purifie his Army. Hee went therefore to each Tent, (for the Souldiers mustered at the Fort of Eipercte ,) and from thence with his Tribunes and Captaines, and the Images of the gods, passed on to the Field, where the Priest was making ready the Altars. The whole Army now ready, each Company vnder his colours, they had made themselues Garlands for the seruice of the gods. Their Speares also, and their Iauelins were adorned with greene boughes. In the meane time, the sacrifices were slaine with all ceremony, namely, a Bull, a Goat, and a Ramme; and amidst their deuout prayers, are thrice carryed about the Army, by the Officers, with their Robes tucked vp on high, and placed before the Altar. Then the King also put himselfe into the Ring, about to offer vp his prayers to the gods: That they would be present with the better cause: and if any of them had not yet fauoured him, that now being appeased, they would bend towards him: That the Army might be safe, and his enemies faile in strength, spirit, and direction: And, if they would be pleased to grant him power, safety, and victory, then vowed hee out of the spoyles of his enemies, to build a Temple to Ivpiter the preseruer, to Mars , and all the other gods in the heauens, that take care of warre or peace: And that there should be yeerely playes, in whose prizes the benefits of the gods towards Sicily should bee carued. While he is offering these vowes, the sacrifices fall: and the Sooth-sayer came to view the entrailes yet breathing. Hee, when hee perceiued the Liuer sound, but stiffely inclosed with a thicke skinne, affirmed, that questionlesse the inwards were good, and promised happy successe, but it would come slowly, and cost much labour. Afterwards the Souldiers, practising their Postures, and sometimes shaking their Speares in warlike manner, and giuing shouts as if the enemy were present, made a shew of a set-battell; and so, after a harmelesse skirmish, returned into their Tents.  A disputation betweene Nicopompvs and a Mathematician; where there is a full discourse of iudiciall Astrologie, and of predictions at the natiuity of Man.  new guest out of Assyria had trauelled ouer many Countries, vnder colour of seeking to learne wisdome, but indeed to make ostentation of his owne. This Fellow was now in Sicily , and hauing beene long conuersant in the Mathematiques, there sold the fooleries of his Art to such people, as through their vaine credulity had hope or desire to know, out of the Starres that reigned at their births, what fortune in their liues or deaths should befall them. It was not then punishable by the Lawes to cast the natiuity of Princes themselues. Now as hee was commending this knowledge to be almost equall with the gods, and was belying his owne predictions to many, in regard that sometimes he had hit right in his promises of felicity, and threatnings of bad fortune; and was telling, how many had not scaped scotfree, for deriding his prophesies, and others not feared them in vaine; it happened that the report of him was brought to Archombrotvs . To whom being sent for, with a long discourse of the great power of the heauenly influence, hee so inflamed the young man, being in loue, as he had a great minde to know out of that Art, the end of his owne desires. The Chald aean promises him faithfully to discouer whatsoeuer the Starres should portend. But why, said hee, should mortall men be desirous to know the future issues of things, onely in priuate fortunes? Why should not Meleander also giue command to search by the course of the heauens, whether hee or his enemies shall prosper in these warres? This speech much moued Archombrotvs , by whose perswasion the King also sent for the Chald aean , with as much hope, as if he had sent to an Oracle. He, full of hope of reward, and presaging indeed much better to himselfe, then the King, out of this businesse comes to the Court: And being asked, by what discipline, or heauenly power, he was able to pierce so farre into the darke myst of future euents, thus answered: It is not that spirit (o King) by which we are led to prophesie; which the Fortune-tellers vse to call vp out of the chinkes of the earth, to fill their mindes with diuine fury: neyther indeed doe wee, as they doe, gull such as aduise with vs, with confused and ambiguous answers. The search of the influence of the heauens onely, and the course of the Starres, is the study of our Nation. We first found out the course of the Sunne: we first discouered the cleere and vntrackt wayes of the heauenly lights, and distinguisht them by their seuerall orbes and names; our contemplation being free in a cleare Ayre vntroubled with cloudes: For, in Assyria , there is seldome any Frost, or Windes with thicke cloudes, to take the sight of the skie from vs. While we are in this contemplation, wee finde by experience, that all humane things are gouerned by the motions of the Starres: neyther are there any other Destinies, which haue rule ouer our births. For, if by their mutuall intercourse the whole Earth receiueth changes, and is forced eyther to plenty or scarcity: if that power giues limits to yeeres & ages, why should we maruel, that naturall bodies doe from them deriue their life, desires, ioyes, and griefes? Let me onely know that minute, wherein your mother brought you forth: I will in a Table draw the whole face of the heauens, and make houses for all the Planets: In them will I place those which had rule at your birth; the worst of all, with Mars ; and Mercvry and Lvna , euer variable, according to the places they hold: which of them ruled, when you entred into the World, and in what degree, and with what aspect the rest then tempered, or crossed him. There shall I clearely reade, doubt it not, whatsoeuer is decreed of you. The speakers confidence, and the largenesse of the promise much inflamed spoke of, vnheard of before, and, as it were, brought to light out of darkenesse, had wonne it the more admiration. But while all were eager in praysing it, Nicopompvs , (for hee by chance was then present with some few more) looking earnestly vpon the Chald aean with an angry smile: Oh my good friend, said hee, you haue taken the power of the gods into your owne hands: Be bold now to giue Law to feare and hope: and if any here loue to be gulled, coozen them freely at their owne request. The earnest longing of and the rest, was somewhat abated at these words. They were all therefore eager to haue Nicopompvs tell them, what he could say, or what he meant, and whether he inueighed thus against the Chald aean , or his art: and chiefly Meleander asked him, why he spoke so churlishly to the Stranger. But he answered, Why should I not rebuke this old Impostor, Sir, that would by this meanes assume to himselfe more power ouer you, then these very Stars haue, which he so falsly magnifies? For, what successe soeuer hee shall be disposed to faine, the quiet of your minde will be troubled with the daily expectation of the euent, which no motion of the Starres could euer so much distract. So will this Tyrant lord it ouer you, laying the blame vpon the harmelesse Starres; and, as if hee would make himselfe to be Ivpiter , will thinke you infinitely indebted to him, if hee shall vouchsafe to presage happy successe. But to conclude, what is it that you hope to heare from him? I will tell you, without casting a figure, all that he will doe for you: After he has filled you a huge piece of Paper, with many lines and points, (not without laughing at it himselfe, if he be wise,) hee will at last with a graue speech promise you good successe, answerable to your estate: for, he doubts not, but that is the right way to gaine fauour  & reward. But while all this is in doing, to make a shew of no common or mercenary Fellow, hee will often bend his brow; then stay a while, as in some deepe and doubtfull contemplation; sometimes gazing vpon you, and sometimes looking vp to the starres: and at last tell you of some fearefull piece of danger, but yet in ambiguous words; and so you may easily draw it seuerall constructions. This will be the fruit of all this great adoe: these answers will hee sell you, which I now tell you for nothing. But why am I so slow to set vpon him, since both your silence, Sir, and his stedfast looke vpon me, seeme to craue this conflict? You say, Mathematician, that out of the placing of the Starres, out of their course, and out of their influence vpon Children, at their entrance into this World, comes the whole disposure of their life and death: yet you confesse, that the whole heauens are driuen with such swiftnesse, as in a small moment the state of the Starres is changed. If therefore this swiftnesse doth quicklier then your thought can reach, carry away the heauenly bodies; and so from another Region their threats or promises be altered; to what man then can you certainely tell his fortune, when it is vncertaine, vnder what temperature of the Planets hee was brought forth? vnlesse you thinke, the Midwiues busie themselues presently to inquire after the Dyall, and distinctly to obserue the minute of the day, and so to lay vp the new-borne Childes starres, as his patrimony. How often does the Mothers danger take away this care? How often is there none present, affected to this superstition? But suppose that at euery birth there were some so curious to obserue this, yet if the Childe be long in bearing; if, as it often chances, it sometimes puts forth a hand, and sometimes a part of the head, and followes not with the whole body, what seat of the Starres does then gouerne his sate? Eyther that which was present at the putting forth of the head, or when hee was wholly brought forth? Besides, since for the most part the Dyals goe false, and the Clocks, and other engines, that shew vs the houres, doe eyther by the drynesse or moistnesse of the Ayre, alter their course; how will you be sure, that the time was truly obserued, and according to the punctuall course of the heauens, by such as tooke such curious and friendly care at the birth of the Infants? But suppose further, that in this there were no mistake, and that you haue rightly found out the Starres, in what degree, and of what power they were at the births of such, whose natiuities you calculate; yet from whence haue the Starres so mighty power ouer our bodies; nay, euen our mindes? Shall I from them forsooth expect my happinesse, and await from them the ordering of my whole life, and manner of my death? Such then, as goe to warre, and there are slaine together, were they therefore all borne vnder the same course of the heauens? If a Ship put to Sea that shall be cast away; will she take in no passengers, but such onely, as the Stars had at their births destin'd for shipwrack? Nay, men that are borne vnder all the seuerall Planets, goe together to the warres, together in a Ship, and haue like deaths, though their births were neuer so different. And againe, not all that were borne vnder the same coniunction of the Planets, doe liue and dye of equall fate. You see the King here: Doe you thinke, all that were borne vnder the same Starre with him, haue Kingdomes also; or wealth at least, to giue vs knowledge, that the Stars were then richly and happily placed? See Cleobvlvs : see your selfe. Such as were borne with him, are they all as wise as he, and so gracious with Kings? or those that were borne with you, are they all (not to speake worse,) Mathematicians? But what, if a man happens vpon a Thiefe? You say, it was fatall, that that Thiefe should kill him. Did then those same Starres, which had appoynted that traueller at his birth to dye by the sword of that Thiefe, giue the same Thiefe also both the minde and the meanes, that hee should at some time both desire and be able to kill him? For, certainely you affirme it no lesse to come from the Starres, that one should kill, then that the other should be killed. And when any man is slaine with the fall of his house, did the wall therefore fall, because it was in the Starres, that his owne house should bury him? No, doubtlesse: the wall being ruinous, oppressed him beeing vnder it with the weight. The same may be said of such dignities as are acquired by voyces: For, whether were those Starres, that ruled at such a mans birth, and (as you hold) promised him such a dignity, able to inforce other men, which were not borne vnder them, and yet whose voyces must of necessity be had, to conferre this dignity vpon him? This vanity should I chiefly condemne of folly and ignorance, but that these titles are too short to expresse the heynousnesse of it. It is an inuention of most execrable superstition: For, to what end is the freedome of man, if hee cannot auoid the determinate order of the Starres? Shall I take care, and busie my selfe in pursuit of honour, shall I labour to flye from vice, and apply my minde to vertue; after the Starres haue absolutely set downe at my birth, what should become of mee? Doe I onely bewayle the losse of humane liberty? Nay, the gift of the gods is also lost. I will hereafter cast away no more Frankincense: I will neither feare the gods, nor seeke their fauour; if they cannot, or will not alter, what is before decreed of me. But yet forsooth, we may pray for our children in their Mothers bellies, that they may haue prosperous Stars at their birth. I will tell you, what I saw once in Mergania : There was a man much addicted to this superstition: so much, as he would not lye with his wife, but he would first see, how the Planets stood affected. If eyther the Dragons tayle were wound about the Stars, or the Scorpion corrupted them by laying his armes about them, or any other danger was threatned from the heauens, he was sure to lye alone. What would you more? He had some children borne him, and all of them fooles. While Meleander and the rest are laughing at this vnlucky curiosity of the Merganian , though somewhat daunted with this vnexpected reproofe, yet re- collected his spirits, and, as if he scorned such a contention, said, There was no wrong offered to the gods, by whose command the Starres had the force hee spoke of, and who had not so vtterly giuen away their power, but that very many things were left, wherein they might shew their fauour or their anger: Neyther were the Mathematicians such fooles, that all that were borne at the same time with a King, should also be Kings: And that to the fore-knowledge of things to come, there was consideration to be had of many other things besides the Starres, whereof the principall are the Ginius of the Age, and the quality of his Race. But if any man shall deny, that the heauens haue any power ouer mankinde, hee is worthy to be counted a madman: since it is manifest to all men, that the aire being either stirred or quiet, according to the quality of the heauens, infuseth it selfe into mens bodies, and, by their breathings, the spirits inclosed receiue the affections inspired into the. So, as he was falling into calmer discourse, Nicopompvs interrupting him, said, Neither, Mathematician, doe we deny all things to the Stars: That a man may be apted for sloth, or industry: may haue a crafty wit, or a free and honest simplicity: be merry, or inclined to a sullen melancholy, and to conclude, be carryed by a strong impulsion eyther to vice or vertue. I deny not, but the heauens haue power ouer vs in such things as these. I will not therefore much gain-say, if you suppose, that such, as from milder Planets haue receiued a naturall meeknesse, liue in a different estate from such, whose angry and turbulent Planets haue indued them with a more violent disposition: Or that those, into whom the gentler heauen hath infused mirth, are of farre more pleasant and sweet conuersation, then such, ouer whom blame not these opinions, which though I doe hold sure rules of vnfallible Art, yet certainely they are the directions of an excellent wisdome. There bee other things, which set mee at difference with you; those especially foure. First, for that I beleeue, the Starres haue power of impulsion, but not (as you thinke) of coaction to eyther good or bad desires. Next, that it cannot bee certainely fore-told, eyther out of the contemplation of the Starres, or a mans owne inclinations, what will bee the passages of this life, or to what end the gods haue appoynted him. Thirdly, that it can neuer bee knowne, which of the Starres doe ingender these affections in Infants. And lastly, that both things in our owne will and power, and the things accidentall, are eyther foolishly or impiously attributed to this necessitie of the Starres working. I would speake at large of these: but I see (Sir) you are weary, and looke on warres, then eyther from me, or the Mathematician. Yea, but, said the King, speake somewhat briefly of each of them. Then, said he, that wee are not inforced by the Starres, it appeareth euen by this; that not a few of vs doe came and stop the impulsion receyued from them, by Reason: and that man doth differ from bruit beasts in nothing more, then the priuiledge of this libertie; which may indeed bee inclyned by feruent motions occurring, eyther to vice or vertue: but enforced it cannot be. Hence it is, that in the Schooles of the Philosophers, nothing is more common, then that a wise mans minde is free from seruitude, and hath rule euen ouer the Starres themselues. Hence also it is, that such daily prayses are giuen to these, that can master their anger, their loue, and all the other violent torrent of passions, wherewith the Stars inuade our mindes. None of which great commendation there would be, if we could not despise and refuse this receiued predominance of the Starres. Further, as the Sunne does not with the same light, and the same beames, affect all things alike, whereon it shines; (for, he nourishes some seeds, and kils others: and the more barren hearbes are burnt vp, while the thicker and fatter iuyce defends the rest:) so, when such a Field, as I may say, of so many Infants new borne, comes so diuers waies prepared into the World by the seuerall quality, health, and habit of their parents; that one and the same influence which each of them receiue from the heauens, cannot worke the same effects in them all. If it findes the Infants disposition agreeable, it predominates; if not, it does little more then correct it: So that to speake of the conditions or life of an Infant; you are not onely to look vp to the heauens, but to the parents also, to the state of the Mother when she was with childe, and to many other things, most of them to you vnknowne. And certainely out of these arguments, the reason of the second question by me proposed, opens it selfe, that is , that it cannot be certainely resolued by the Starres, what mortall men are to doe or suffer. For, since we can gouerne our innate affections, why cannot wee also auoid those things, which those affections would haue brought vpon vs, if we had bin subiect to them? And, since this quality of the powerfull heauens infuses it selfe, sometimes more, sometimes lesse, out of diuers causes, into the minde of man at his birth; why should you thinke this influence to worke vpon all with like effect, which had not the same power vpon all? I added, that it could not be certainely knowne, what was the coniunction or disagreement betweene the Starres, that infuse into young Infants the seedes of their inclinations to come. You onely haue regard to that at their very birth. And why not as well to that, at the quickening in the Mothers wombe? Why not to the other Constellations, while yet the body being tender, and the soule not knowing of it, was making ready in the Mothers belly, for the patience of liuing in this World? I should verily thinke, the Childe should no lesse depend vpon the condition of those Starres, then vpon their natiuity. What I last alledged; namely, that eyther things free or casuall, could not bee ascribed to the power of the Starres without sacriledge, I should now vrge the more vehemently, but that I feare by my tediousnesse to make the King thinke better of you. Yet this will I say, that both all of you so thinke; and that you cannot thinke so without impiety, or folly. What is more free, then to marry a wife? to take this or that course of life? Or what is more casuall, then for a man to dye vpon a Sword, to be drowned in the water, to haue a quarrell, to be sicke in some yeere of his life, to be fauoured of Princes, or to be famed for some great honour, or disgrace? Yet you Mathematicians vse to giue answeres of such things as these. Heere indeed are you boldest: here lyes your best prey. A seruant lately committed a theft: he flyes, and is searched for by his Master. There was nothing more casuall, then that either he should be apprehended, or escape. Well, he happened to escape: & presently one of your profession, an excellent Prophet of things that were past, could tell vs, that the Thiefe was got safe away, because the Moone was then in coniunction with Mercvry , the Theeues Patron, and so had hid him. Hee could hardly perswade mee, that he told vs this tale in earnest. So it seemes, it was not the doing of the gods, nor the Masters diligence, nor the theeues owne cunning, that he should eyther be taken, or get away, but all this was done by the gouernance of the Starres; by whom, if humane affaires be so disposed, we bestow all our paines and care vpon our businesse to no purpose. For, what they haue ordered, shall be done, though we sit still: and what they forbid, will not goe forward by our best endeuour. But to passe by many other things, whereby I might refute this iniury, which you offer both to the gods and Nature; I aske you, Chald aean , whether That power, which portends a happy life, or a violent death to the Infant at his birth, and appoynts him to liue thirty yeeres or more; whether, I say, That power that is to bring on these chances, and this fortune, continue so long in heauen, and expects the appointed time, when it is to slide downe to earth, and there to inforce the necessary instruments to their necessary effects; or whether it be ingrafted to the Infant it selfe, that after his bringing vp in his infancy, and then, a little more growth, he should breake out in the time prefixed, and fulfill what the Starres had commanded? If you say, It remaines still in heauen; you are manifestly impudent: for, whereas the Childes fortune (as you would haue it) depends on the manner of the coniunction of the Starres at his birth; after the course of the same Planets haue ended that coniunction in heauen, and begun another perchance contrary to the first, in what Coffer or heauenly Store-house shall that first power be laid vp, which after many yeeres is at last to be opened, and brought vpon the Stage of this World? But if you thinke, this destiny sticks to the Infant, which afterwards shall worke vpon him being growne a man, you trifle worse then before. As who should say, the cause was in the shipwrackt man, that the windes grew so high: or that the Master forgetting himselfe, ran his ship vpon the shelfes: or the husbandman was the cause either of the war which had vndone him; or of the faire weather that had ripened his Corne: and that such as are swallowed vp of the gaping earth, had broken those strong bonds of Nature, by the violence of their fate, so to come to the death appoynted for them by the Starres. I speake no more against this most dangerous madnesse, which damnes both gods and men to one and the same captiuity, and which being destitute of reason, and often coozening it selfe with vaine successes, doth notwithstanding often put idle, and sometimes wicked hopes into the mindes of those that follow it; or else with an vnprofitable feare, keepes them vnawares in suspence. They vaunt neuerthelesse of some of their owne Oracles, whereto the successe hath beene answerable: out of these they seeke to gaine beliefe to their Art, as not worthy to be despised. First therefore, if any such thing haue been, I deny that it happened by any necessity of the Fates, or enforcement of the Starres. I should sooner beleeue, there is some god, who in reuenge of their impious credulity, represents sometimes to mortall men these very things, which they feared would fall vpon them, not from the gods, but from the Starres. Besides, as dreames, though happening without art or ground; yet sometimes shew the casuall shapes of things to come: and the blinde man throwing many Stones, sometimes vnwittingly hirs the marke: so you Mathematicians, while you doe often and euery-where tell many lyes, no great maruell, though at some time Fortune commends your boldnesse, and your selues wonder that you haue happened vpon the truth. Yea, the fewnesse of your answeres that are boasted of abroad, discouers the vanity of your Art. For, what more palpable signe can there be, that you are not vsed to truth, then that it is bragged of as a prodigie, if your folly doe once by chance light vpon it? But neyther am I so much in loue with rumour, as to beleeue all it deliuers touching your predictions. Miracles, when they are reported, are wont to bee entertayned with the applause of the wondring hearers, and though they be not exactly true, yet after they haue once gotten a writer, they are pleasant to all, they grow in esteeme, and are commended for their antiquity. After this manner, I beleeue, your Fables first got credit: vnlesse you will say, this impious Art hath beene much aduanced by the commerce of wicked natures: For, such doe busily pry into passages betweene men, and inquire into their secrets, and haue very cunning gesses at things to come. It is the lesse wonder therefore, if your Chald aeans , after you are once admitted to their shamefull familiarity, and they often shewing and suggesting things aboue mortall capacity, haue sometimes growne famous. I stay too long: If you know what will befall Sicily , why can you not (Mathematician) as well perceiue your owne fate? Why did you not know, that I should this day fall heauy on you? Why did you not, as a proofe of your Art, say before hand, that some would be here to crosse you? To conclude, if you can finde out, whether the King shall triumph ouer his enemies; let it first appeare, whether hee will giue you any credit. But shall so great a King beleeue you in his chiefest affaires, vpon an Art so idle, as when it presumes to fort-shew the euent of the lightest and most common busines, is, after the vaine euent, seen subiect to all mens laughter? For, that faire and cloudy dayes, great showres, stormes, and winds are bestowed vpon man-kinde, by the correspondence of the Stars amongst themselues; your selues professe, and we partly acknowledge. Yet so frequently doe you mistake, when, out of the inspection of the Stars, you promise eyther faire or rainy weather, that your licence of faining and lying is now growne to a Prouerbe. Doe you your selfe search into the heauens: follow the course of the Moone: draw in your Tables the agreement and disagreement amongst the heauenly lights: Then, if you can, shew vs the faire daies, and the foule: If you be not deceiued: if the euent doe not condemne you, I will not refuse to giue vp my selfe to be punished by your Art, which I haue thus prouoked. Neither will you say, that the Stars haue lesse power ouer the ayre, the cloudes and faire weather, then ouer the bodies and estates of mortall men. Since then you are ignorant of those things, why should we thinke, you fore-shew these later? You will know (forsooth) by the Stars, how these wars will be ended, and how the Sicilians mindes will be affected: and yet be ignorant when the same stars shall send you a showre to water your Garden, or faire weather for your Cattell. No, you should confesse out of your not-knowing the seasons, either that you know not the will and power of the Stars; or else, that there is some other power to you vnknown, that at his owne pleasure abrogates the decrees and gouernement of the Starres. But if you can so easily know the publique affaires of Kings, why doe you not increase your priuate estate with the same knowledge? Why doe you not out of the fore-sight of future euents, auoyd all troubles, and pursue felicity? When I was in Phrygia , there was an old Woman, that made gaine by these Diuinations. It chanced, that out of a wealthy Citizens house a rich piece of Plate was stolne: he that had the charge of the houshold-stuffe, goes with his friend to this cunning woman with money, vainely assuring himselfe, that instantly he should catch the Thiefe, and recouer the Plate. It was in the morning early, and the old woman was, iust at their comming, opening her doore, which, by a filthy dung-heape there throwne, stunke extremely. I know not what neighbour had by night played this pranke with the woman. She stood fretting, And, if I knew, said shee, what Russian has done this wrong to night, I would returne it him; by Apollo , I would thrust all the filth he hath laid at my doore, into his owne throat. Hearing this, hee that came to aske her aduice, looked vpon his companion, And, why, said hee, shall wee cast away our money? Can this old woman know who robbed vs, that knowes not her own businesse, and hauing the dung cast almost in her face, knows not yet with whom to be angry? And so he went backe from the Sybill , faster then he came. I know not what Poet it was, that published it in an Epigram, which is yet in my memorie; and because it is but short, I will, if you please, repeate it.  Lots, Starres, Apollo's in-most roome, And Birds fore-knowing Fates to come, You, the old Hag, with wrinkles dere, Raging, inuokes, in that attire In which shee shakes the labouring Moone: Kings Councels, and the gods fare-doome, And what hid thoughts in each heart dwell, She knowes, and can for money tell. One thing declare to her vnknowne, Who at her doore this dung has throwne? What Augury, ( Apollo , say!) What light shall finde the knaue? what way? In vaine, old Sybill , dost thou pray Lots, Starres, Apollo's in most roome, Or Birds fore-knowing Fates to come: For, Father Phoebvs to thy nose Has left this secret to disclose.  Enna . The artificiall clemency of Lycogenes .  The rest merrily followed. But Cleobvlvs aduised the King, that though he were an idle Guest, yet he was dangerous, and therefore not to be sent away in discontent. He was like enough, being angred, to giue out, the Starres threatned danger; and the Souldiers apt enough to hearken to his superstitions. They therefore call him, being now very pensiue, and giue him thankes for his promised paines: but the times would not permit them now to make vse of him. Neither did it stand with the Maiesty of the King, to make a curious enquiry into the fate of his Natiuity, as if he doubted of the victory: yet hee should receiue reward for his offered seruice. And without further stay, they send the Iuggler halfe a Talent, to redeeme the wrong they feared from him. From this, they betake themselues to waightyer affaires; new Messengers euer and anon bringing vnwelcome newes of Lycogenes his preparations. For, in the Kings Army there were not aboue ten thousand foote compleatly armed: their number of Horse, two thousand: Archers and Slingers, three thousand fiue hundred: thirty hooked Waggons: tenne Ships, fully armed and manned: and of other shipping fit for warre, double the number. The Hyperephanians reuolted not by any publike Decree: but euery one, as his affection was, sought either with the King, or for the enemy. But this storme had helped Lycogenes to a farre greater strength of men and furniture. Not far from Syracusa , he distributed his mustered men vnder their Commanders. Thirty thousand Foot, and sixe thousand Horse, had entred their names in his Muster-booke: and that he should not be without some ominous presage of good successe, the first man in his booke was called Nicon : which the common peoples superstition (it happening so by chance) receiued as an auspicious signe. Lycogenes was sure, he should no longer haue command, then they continued their raging madnesse. While things therefore were in this heat, he set forward against the King, with the whole body of his Army. The King on the other side marcheth to a small Riuer, which hauing worne deepe and hollow the Channell by the beaddy torrents of water, was defended on each side with exceeding high bankes. The naturall moistnesse of the earth, and the water hauing lately ouer-swolne his bankes, had made the ground about it vnfit for marching. Lycogenes being thus barred, might be kept off with a smaller number. And hee indeed came strongly on; but labouring to goe about this wet and dangerous place, wheresoeuer he sought to get ouer the Riuer, the Kings soldiers opposed and stopped him. But hee, lest in the meane space he should lose time, sends Anaximander , his sisters sonne, and besiege Enna and Catana . And many out of his Tents and the Kings, had daily Skirmishes, with variable successes. But these light bickerings betweene priuate men, abated little of the maine strength of either side. Who would thinke, that amidst such horrible broyles, and euen vnder the stroke of danger, any other businesse or passions should bee entertained? Yet were then with those which were openly perceiued. Shee, hauing her minde wholly fixed on the vertues of Poliarchvs , after the spirits of her minde spent in solitary teares, her body also wasted away: and she often would say, That him, ought to be presently called backe. But Archombrotvs had farre other thoughts: Disquieted with the bitter sweetnesse of vncertaine hope, he sometimes cursed the warre, for that among the Tents he could not haue leisure to resolue vpon a fit course to discouer his loue: sometimes he reioyced, that now he had meanes to shew his valour; and out of both these respects, grew more enraged against the enemy. Yet did he often blame himselfe, in that hee alone was present in so great danger of Meleander and Argenis . For, indeed, hee ought to haue an Army on foote, and so, by the greatnesse of the benefit, to haue shewne the greatnesse both of his loue, and of his birth. And surely he had not failed in all this; but the affaires required much time, to send newes of the state of Sicily into his owne Countrey; then, to take vp Soldiers there; and after, to transport the Army. But the imminent danger from was his care lesse about Poliarchvs : whom, his raging iealousie euery where offering to his wounded mind, he begun to slight to the King, yet euer so dissembled his hatred, as he was not discouered to worke his owne ends. He ascribes it to a peeuish stubbornnes, that when he sent Lycogenes his Letter, he did not write himselfe to the King. That he had forgotten both the King and himselfe: whether it were out of negligence, or pride: and that the King should wrong his owne Maiesty, if he wrote first. So by little and little the Kings eares were dayly accustomed to such vnkind, yet cunningly-deliuered language; and so much the easlier, for that hee suspected no difference betweene Archombrotvs and Poliarchvs Gelanorvs also perceiued, that in at his departure. But seeing him growne gracious in Court, he easily imputed this strangenesse to fortune: which is often afraid to acknowledge former friendship, as vnworthy of a mans present greatnesse, or at least troublesome. In the meane while, by Argenis her direction, he sets in order his Masters house and family, (for hee had now receiued possession thereof from the Ouerseers, by the Kings command) so as all men ghessed, he would shortly be there. But he made speed to returne into Africa ; and was long put off by delaies. At last, the King hearkening to Archombrotvs his speeches, without bestowing either reward or kind looke vpon him, bids him tell Poliarchvs ; that hee is a King, not a Poisoner: that Olo odemvs and Eristhenes had by their deaths quitted him of that aspersion: Neither could he see any cause, why hardly keepe in his anger: yet, remembring he spake to the King, and that he could not bee so ready to speake, as the King would be to reuenge, replyed onely thus; That Poliarchvs would not onely write, but with all speede be there, that if hee had in any thing offended, it might be examined. With these words, putting Meleander , that now of himselfe feared all things, into diuersity of thoughts, he left him; and told Argenis , how discourteously the King had spoken of Poliarchvs . But she hardly refraining from teares; The gods, Gelanorvs , said shee, haue left nothing now vndone, to hurt miserable wee, are either of vs pyning away with the others griefe. To this is added danger to me-ward from Lycogenes , of losing this Kingdome; which, I know, because hee loues me, will be the greatest griefe to Poliarchvs . What will it doe him good to bee ouer-loden with more sorrowes, by hauing knowledge of my Fathers anger toward him, whom, I verily thinke, no ill intent, but onely calamity, hath changed? If I may request any thing at your hands, Gelanorvs , both for my owne sake, and his, promise me, that he shall not know of this: I will see to it, that my Father shall repent his fault, and loue Poliarchvs : you shall haue what reward of your silence soeuer your condition can be capable of: but in vaine is your hope, if you tell your Master this, that I shall not know of it. Though he should promise you to keepe it secret, yet, if the Fates shal euer bring me him backe againe, I shall winne it from him, and know how much you haue deceiued me: what power I haue with him, no man knowes better then your selfe. Gelanorvs protesting to obey Argenis , she deliuers him Letters to Poliarchvs , in which she earnestly entreates him with all haste to come ouer into Sicily . If it were Lycogenes his fate to be conquered, she chiefly wished, he might be the Conqueror: but if the gods had decreed harder fortune, hee should helpe to defend them in their flight. And then shee sends him, laden with rewards, to the Ship. Now were two moneths passed since the Siege of Enna : their victuals failed them, and they had no hope of succours from the King. Hauing therfore spent all things, but their loyalty, they send Embassadours to Lycogenes , to treat of yeelding. He, exceeding glad to haue meanes to shew his victory and mercy at once, answered, He desired nothing at their hands, but that they would be happy: That to that end onely, he had sent his forces against them: They should returne into the whole body of Sicily , to whose generall voice against Meleander they had vnwisely opposed. But many of them desired, that they might haue safe passe to the Kings Army: which being granted, they brought more feare then helpe to Meleander's Souldiers; as they discoursed the miseries of Enna , and the strength of the besiegers, in excuse of their giuing it vp. After the taking of Enna , Lycogenes vaunted himselfe boldlier then before, and many wayes attempted the passages, to get ouer the Riuer  & Marish holden by the King. And Meleander , fearing the place could not be longer kept, about the first watch makes great fires thorow all his Tents, that the Enemy might not perceiue he raised his Campe, and without sound of Drum or Trumpet, retires his Army to the Field vnder Eipercte . Lycogenes the next day pursuing him, spreads his triumphing Army ouer all the Fields, with a terrible shew; his Souldiers vnciuilly expressing their confidence with lowd and barbarous shouts.  The vnsettled resolutions of Meleander . The King of Sardinia comes to his ayde: and vnder what colour he then arriued in Sicily .  a mind to try it out by battell; sometimes, to defend himselfe within the Walls and Forts of the Citie; and sometimes, as if all were lost, he thought to fly into Africa . It chanced, that neglecting his rest, he walked alone one morning by day-break into the Garden. It was a high place, and had a large prospect into the Sea vnderneath it. Reuoluing with himselfe, what were his most honourable course in these extremities, sometimes a braue resolution of fighting came into his head: but by and by, considering himselfe to bee both an old man and a Father, the care of his Daughter drawes him to more aduised deliberations: Should then that young Virgin be the Conquerours prey? and should shee, that was borne to a Scepter, now become a slaue? Then againe come into his thought, the inconueniences of flight, the wrath of the gods, and (which most goes to the heart in vndeserued calamity) his happinesse in times past. In this heate of disquiet passions, he casteth his amazed eyes toward the Sea. But the Cloudes that couered it from the neighbouring Mountaines, being dissolued by the Sunne, did by little and little discouer a fearefull forme of things to an amazed and distracted mind. For, the Sea was couered with Ships, not farre from the Port, with sayles spred, seeming to bring new warre and new feares vpon him. A mighty Nauy, proudly comming on with sayles, made a glorious shew, with the brightnesse of their Armour, and the multitude of men. And when the Ships came within something more then a Gunshot, the whole Nauie, with loud shouts of the Mariners, suddenly cast Anchor. Neither was the King long in thinking, who they should bee, or from whence they should come: but giuing ouer himselfe to feare the worst, and often stamping on the ground; Alas, said hee, and will not then the Fates leaue me meanes to escape by flight? Lo, a Nauie from Lycogenes : Lo, an Army to watch the mouth of the Ports. But indeed, this falls not out vndeseruedly. This accident will enforce thee, dull old man, to a iust and manly fortitude: and what thou oughtest to haue done of thine owne accord, now, see, thy foes haue taught thee. Shall I aduance my small Nauie against them, being so farre inferiour in my estate, shipping, and power? Or shall I, leauing that course, take a better way; turne against Lycogenes in a Land-battell, and so, at least, dye in my owne Sicily? Thus distracted, and now seeking no more but to dye with honour, he calls to him those that were neerest him: To them he shewes the fearefull sight at Sea, and commands a Pinnace to be sent out, to discouer and bring backe certaine newes of the suspected Nauy. Archombrotvs , aduentrous on any danger, desired, this vnsafe charge of discouery might be committed to him. But the King willed him, (being through his youth and valour exceeding eager) to expect worthier dangers. In the meane while, they perceiue a small Ship rowing towards them from the opposite Nauy: and Timonides being sent to entertaine them at their comming, and to demaund what was fit to be knowne, first receiued the good signe of better fortune than was expected. In the Barge was a Herald: and because he should not be thought to come of an vnfriendly message, his head and his staffe were wound about with Oliue. But not confessing to Timonides , who he was, or what message he brought, when he desired to speake to the King, Meleander (his feares hauing now almost left him) presently admitted him to his presence. Then said the Herald: Radirobanes , King of Sardinia , and of the Ilands Maiorca and Minorca , sends this Token to you, Meleander , King of Sicily , his Noble and ancient friend and entertainer: If it shall please you to compare it, you shall finde it to bee the same that was mutually vsed betweene his and your Ancestors. And withall, he deliuers him a halfe Ring, in the out-side whereof was a little hand of gold, which if it were ioyned to the other halfe, it met also with the like hand in like sort held out, as if it offered it selfe to bind a hearty league and friendship. Once againe, Doe you entertaine this friendship, o King? said the Herauld. And the King acknowledging it, for that the other part of the Ring was in his custody; Heere is, said hee, at hand vpon your Seas, your friend Radirobanes , with the chiefe forces of his Dominion, which he hath brought in his Nauie. And the cause of his bringing them, was, for that when he heard it reported, that you were embroyled with a rebellion of your disloyall Subiects, he could not endure, especially being your friend, to haue so vile an example giuen against Kings. Meleander held his peace, not easily apprehending so sudden a benefit from the gods: yet shewed his constancy well, in that his countenance was not changed. You shall tell your King,  o Herald, said hee, that I now pardon the rage of my people, whom some friendly god hath stirred vp to this action, that I might so haue meanes to enioy the helpe and sight of so great a friend. Let him now enter Sicily , and vnderstand that we will not be more slow in honouring him, then he hath beene in deseruing. With these words, the Herald was led aside to take a short refection: and in the meane time Meleander calling a Councell of the chiefe about him, began to aske, whether it were fit, he should goe to Radirobanes , or to try by some of his chiefe Nobility, how to get surer pledges of his trust. They were of seuerall opinions, not daring to trust, or distrust so great and happy a fortune. For, why should Radirobanes be at that cost and paines for anothers benefit? especially, not beeing requested, nor formerly acquainted? All too-exceeding fauours are suspitious. It was scarce credible, he should rigge out such a Nauy for Meleander's good, more then his owne. For, said the King, there were many differences betweene my Father and his, and agreements after, with a shew of friendship, both sides, indeed being rather tyred with the warre, then laying aside their hatred. Now, what I shall thinke, whether they bring ayd or treason, I am doubtfull. But Cleobvlvs affirmed, there was no doubt to bee made, but the King should goe to Radirobanes . For, if he came as a friend, certainely his help came in season, and no humanity could bee thought too much towards him. But if he already were the Kings enemy, or a friend to Lycogenes, Meleander was not able to resist a Conspiracy both by Sea and Land: and it would better sute with the Maiestie of a King, rather to be deceiued with a shew of loue and trust, than to be conquered with open hostility. But from whence, you may say, proceedes this loue of Radirobanes towards heare) excessiuely desirous of glory, hath taken this occasion; which, besides honour to be got in the wars, might giue him way, Sir, with his good deserts toward you, to the marriage of your Daughter. And so he will fight, as it were, for himselfe; being so much the more a friend to Sicily , and the more respectiue to your Maiestie, the greater his hopes shall be to be adopted into your Throne. And certainely, Cleobvlvs was in the right. For the fame of Argenis , and his desire to obtaine the Kingdome of Sicily , which belonged to her, had giuen Radirobanes this resolution. He had made ready his shipping before, for an expedition, which he secretly intended against the Mauritanians . But newes being brought him of the Sicilian war, hee let Africa alone for a while, and with a more laudable resolution, sayled towards Meleander .  Sicilians . The iealousie of Archombrotvs .  consultation) offended with the very name of marriage with Argenis , was so incensed both against Radirobanes and Cleobvlvs , that hee could hardly keepe his eyes from discouering his discontent. Yet presumed he not to gaine-say it, or to speake at all. But the King highly commending to put in readinesse the Kings Barge. The King, in the times of peace, loued to be rowed in it about the then safe shores. It was but a small one, and tooke not in aboue eight Rowers, and so many passengers. But beeing gorgeously adorned with gold and siluer pictures, it seemed to play vpon the water round about it, with the lustre of the shaddowes, and not farre from the Sterne, in little Letters of gold, were written these Verses:  This little Boat, faire Sea-borne Queene, doth craue (Resembling thy faire shell) thine aid to haue, And sure protection. For warres hot Alarmes This was not built; when fierce Bellona armes Encountring Ships vpon the trembling waues: Nor can she stand rough Boreas when he raues, And in the waues by course himselfe infolds. She, neere the shore, on Seas, her calme course holds, When faire Cymothoe singing on the Rockes, Combes off the South-wind's dew from her greene lockes. Then dares shee venture to the farthest shores, And her great Master trust with a few Oares. If wee, great Queene, thy Eryx honour'd haue; Doe not our King to the wind's mercy leaue: Hold thou the Stretcher in thine owne faire hand, Doe thou the Oares of this small Boat command: And o're the curled waues smooth thou the way. Vncessant stormes all worldly greatnesse driue, And, as in raging Seas, doe Monarchs liue. But then were the benches couered with purple Tapestry; and in the Sterne was a place like a Throne, which would hold two. Evrymedes was left to keep the Castle; and Arsidas sent before in a little Boat, to giue notice to ouer all Eipercte , that the Sardinians were come with strong forces, to the succour of their friends, the Sicilians . it slowly beleeued. So as this sudden mirth, and not hope only, but assurance of victory, now heartened those that were a little before deiected. They throng all ouer the Market place; and as euery man came, with clapping of hands, gratulated to each other their preseruation. Neither was their ioy lesse, who had the guard of the Walls. But when the King went downe to the Hauen, they so filled the Skies with the acclamations of the people, and then with Trumpets, and all other Instruments vsed in time of war, as the noise was carried into the enemies Tents. And because it was a war-like sound, Lycogenes was so bold to beleeue, that the Kings Army, hauing lost all hope, would desperately hazzard their last fortune, and seeke their deaths in assailing him. He vsed therefore these words to those about him: This day is our last of trauell; so as we doe but only giue them meanes to dye, from whom we haue taken away the meanes to liue. Go, and call the old and now priuiledged Soldiers to this spoile. All the gods, that this victory might be the more pleasant, haue hastened it vnlooked for. Thus speaking, while he putteth them in aray, and is, both by his lookes and language, an Author  & example of courage to them all: he sends forth Scowts in the meane time, to bring him certaine notice of their comming. And those, hauing viewed all the places betweene them and their enemies, and meeting with no signe of hostility; returned backe to their Tents, bringing word, that certainely no armed men appeared in the Fields, but they might heare a rowt, as it were, of mad men from the walls, and that a noyse of Drums and Trumpets rung ouer the whole Countrey round about. Lycogenes , appalled, and not vnworthily, with these presages of Fortune's forsaking him, yet neuerthelesse puts his Army in readinesse; and sends others priuily, not in Souldiers habit, but as Countrey people out of the next Villages, the more safely to discouer all attempts. By this time Arsidas speaking with Radirobanes , had shewed him the ships wherein Meleander was comming towards him: For many Barges attended him into the Maine, and with their multitude and eagernesse, as in so sudden a ioy, they made a loud noyse. Radirobanes , his Admirall, was most royally and magnificently adorned, and stood fastened with three Anchors. The Streamers vnusefull to the Sailes, and onely hanging for brauery, with the quicke snatches of the changing winde, wantonly played in the ayre. The Lanternes also, and the Sayle-yards lightly followed the winde; while that was helping the loose-hung Banners to display themselues. And the many Ropes that were fastened from the three Masts to the sides of the Ship, made shew to the beholders a farre off, as it were of a large Net, or a faire Tent halfe open. And the Mariners that day handsome, were in blue attyre: and eyther plyed their seuerall Offices, or else were, as with wings vpon the Ropes and Sayle- yards, to shew their skill. The Rowers vpon their seats had the like Suites. The Souldiers had on the richest of their Armour and Cassocks. The King also hauing often beene in Liguria , had learned from the Italians , the markes and ornaments of Maiesty, and had his Lictors in the fore-decke of his Ship, with their rods and fasces, as if they would keepe backe the waters. From the Ship ribbes to the Sea, were woodden staires, couered with blue Tapistry; on the top of which, Radirobanes stood to receiue Meleander , clad in a kingly Robe, gyrt about him with a wouen Girdle of Gold, and fine Linnen. His Sword hung in it, making an excellent shew with the workemanship of the grauen Scabberd. He let his hayre hang downe vpon his shoulders, somewhat more curiously anoynted, then became a Souldier. Hee had then most inward with him, an old Man of Liguria , to whose charge hee was committed being a Childe; and now growne a Man, he did not much follow his counsell, but suffered him onely to know, what hee before had resolued to doe: hee was called Virtiganes . The King at this time in talke with him and Arsidas , looked towards the Coast of Sicily , and with a superfluous complement fell into commendation of the site, and yet vnknowne riches of the Countrey. At length, Meleander's Boat comes to the Ship: and hee, with so high, as Radirobanes might giue him his hand. But then they seemed to grow each to other with imbraces, as if they had beene familiar before: and him, hee againe with words extenuating the benefit, made it so much the greater. After some little conference betweene them, one admits the Noble men of Sicily to salute him: the other, those of Sardinia . Presently also, first put himselfe into his power, by comming into his Ship. The harmony was heard both ouer all the shore, and the Nauy: and so was the shouting and applause of the Souldiers and Mariners, extolling the mutuall loue and trust of both the Kings. They did not trust their safeties to the sword, to fortresses, or their guard; but with simple integrity, and right of hospitality, sweetly enioy each others conuersation. O, often miserable greatnesse! wherein it is a rare happinesse to attaine to the true comfort of priuate man, and enioy vnsuspected friendship. At their landing, they againe fell to imbraces and complement. From thence, Meleander , giuing Radirobanes the better hand, brought him (hauing first vpon the Sand adored the gods of Sicily ) to their Horses, which not farre off stood ready for them: and so, attended by their Nobles and people, they set forward first to the City, and then to the Castle. It was Meleander's Noblemens charge, for that night to giue good welcome to the Peeres of Sardinia . They stroue who should entertaine them; which they all did with such hearty affections and offices of humanity, as it seemed by their present chearefulnesse, they had forgotten the danger of the warre now pressing hard vpon them. But Archombrotvs tooke little pleasure in this, conceiting now, he had such a Riuall come, as it were heynous both in the King and Argenis not to loue him. Whiles therefore others entertaine Radirobanes his friends, he, as hauing more care of the more profitable businesse, goes to the walls, as with charge in the Kings name to the Watch-men, through all the Watchtowers, that they should not, vpon confidence of these succours, breake vp their watch: For, often had such sudden ioy and security made way for the enemy to doe some mischiefe. As soone as hee was got out of the throng, whereof he had long beene weary, hee begun to walke in a long and empty Rampire, carelesly hanging his head, folding his armes, and knocking his brest. One while he was halfe mad and amazed: another while, many confused resolutions offered themselues all at once vnto him, not knowing what to thinke, or where to begin his moanes. O you reuenging gods, said hee! for, thou hatedst Poliarchvs , thou hindredst the returne of a man whom once thou dearly louedst, to gaine a more dangerous Riuall. How vnhappily hath Radirobanes succeeded my loue would haue made me. But what force, what vertue is of power to equall mee with Radirobanes ? He, not trusting to himselfe, but the whole estate and force of his Dominions, comes into the Field, more truely against mee, then eyther for Meleander , or against Lycogenes . But, loue I needfull and timely succours, I may not oppose. Thou, dull stupid Louer, knowest not how to deserue what thou desirest: hee hath found the way to bestow a blessing, before he aske one. Here, in a myst of doubts, fiercely stamping as he went, for a good space he stayed silent; vntill, renewing his chiding with Fortune, with a discontented smile: Lo, now (said he) three of vs labour for Argenis : three of vs are in pursuit of that happinesse, which one onely must enioy; I my selfe, know, may be in as bad case as my selfe. Wretch! dost thou imagine, that there will not daily more and more haue the same desires and hopes; vnlesse she be vnworthy to be loued, or thou alone hast eyes? But there will be time enough to keepe off the rest. Looke thou now to this onely, that this storme from time to haue difference with him. No doubt, hee will not beare away the reward before the victory: yet how many turnes are there in the warres? In how small time hath Fortune changed her selfe into seuerall shapes? What if this boaster of his valour be slaine in the Field? What, if the ouer-greatnesse of this benefit make him suspected by Meleander ? Care must be had, that these warres against Lycogenes , be to my honour with Meleander , and a rudiment against Radirobanes . In the meane time, all heat and violence must be forborne, and thou must liue at peace with him, with whom in thy heart, thou wishest mortall warre. Framing himselfe, as well as hee could, to this resolution, he goes backe to the Watch, and charges them, not be so farre carryed away with their mirth, as to neglect the care of their places. The like command Evrymedes , and the rest of the Commanders gaue them. But the secure souldiers, though neuer so much reproued, would not abstaine in their Watch from their Cups and Garlands. The next morning, the Kings had consultation with their chiefe men about the manner of the warre: Radirobanes his Legions were yet in the Ships. And he, not well knowing it would be suspitious, if hee should desire to haue his strongest troupes brought into the Towne, preuented the shamefastnesse of words: In this Nauy which lyeth at Anchor, I haue brought eight thousand men in compleat Armes; slingers, and bow-men, about foure thousand. I haue also young and able horse-men: but I shipped but few horses, in regard of their weight, and length of the voyage. If you can helpe vs to more, they shall haue Riders of my people. But, that Lycogenes may no longer escape his punishment, we will, if you please, land the Army. And because the craggy shore, inuironed with Rockes, affords onely one way into the City, through the Greene, the Companies shall be receiued one after another, within the walls: and when they shall out at another Gate be passed beyond the Forts of the City, to the Tents, which wee will pitch for them at the foot of the Hill; then shall more and more Companies in like manner come vp to the City. There shall be a Guard of your owne Souldiers in both the Gates; as well in that, where the forces shall enter, as in that, out of which they shall be sent into the field. Meleander answered, there would be no need of such trouble: neyther was any thing to be feared from those Souldiers, that had beene vnder the discipline of Radirobanes . If Radirobanes would haue a Guard in the Gates, hee should set some there of his owne Souldiers: and that hee should neuer thinke himselfe in more safety then amongst the troupes. With such speeches as these, the Kings had a great contention, who should exceed each other in humanity. But as the Sardinians and Baleareans were set on Land, they both went on horse-backe to the Market-place, to see and encourage the Souldiers. Cassock: his head bare, saue for a wreathe about it. Meleander also was armed himselfe, and with a farre more settled Maiesty, drew all mens eyes and affection to him. The slingers first entred the City: These were Baleareans , each one armed with three slings. No Nation at that time had more skill in this Engine: which indeed they all practized from their Cradles. They were reported to kill Birds in the Ayre: and it was counted a shame for any to misse. The Sardinians Ensignes followed, who, armed after the manner of their neighbours the Africans , were couered with smooth and huge shields: short swords hanging at their Girdles, which they vsed after their Darts were spent: their Helmets, for the most part, of Brasse, with crests, making a terrible shew engrauen with the iawes of Beares and Lyons. That great Army was hardly passed in the whole day. Archombrotvs and Timonides were in into the trenches prepared for them. They raysed a new Rampire, and with the trenches, which Meleander's souldiers had made, enuironed their increased Campe. They had large allowance from Meleander , and the Sicilians were commanded, some of them to sup with the Sardinians , and others, to inuite them to feast with them in their owne Tents.  his Army. Meleander pardoneth all that will lay downe their Armes, and come to him; whereupon, many of the Rebels runne to the Kings side.  was credibly reported, that Radirobanes was come with fresh succours, their feare cured many of them of their madnesse. Then, at last, they saw, how hainously they had dared to disobey the King. They begun now with much pensiuenesse to thinke, the gods were present to reuenge wronged Maiesty: and their deiection of minde made them fancy to themselues, out of all, euen common and dayly accidents, ominous signes of bad successe. These feares were increased, by the chearefulnesse of the Kings, who were very confident in their owne forces: for, they were ashamed to stay, as besieged, in the Towne. They therefore aduanced their Campe from the foot of the Mountaine, neerer the Enemy; that if he could not be drawne to fight, they might eyther force him out of his trenches, or they would beleaguer him. The goodnesse of the cause, and Maiesty of the Generalls, are often of great importance in warre. The two Kings Campe found an awfull reuerence, with their more auspitious beginnings; the Pauilions of Meleander and Radirobanes , were high and large, making a glorious shew with Ensignes of both Kingdomes. So, were their Souldiers more animated with hope: and the enemies on the other side, with now deiected spirits, look't into the basenesse of their owne cause. Lycogenes also well knew, he had no way left, but to put it to a tryall by battell, before his Souldiers feare had too deepely wrought vpon them: and was glad the Kings had the same desire. It was yet scarce light day, when his Scouts brought him notice, that the Kings Army was drawne out of the Campe, and made ready for the fight. Therefore, that this fierce Generall might not be too backward, hee hung vp in the top of his Tent, a red Flagge, in signe of ioyning battell. Then hee passed thorow all his Campe; infusing hope and courage, now into the Souldiers, then into the Captaines, with his lookes, speech, and gesture. What should they feare, being renowned by so many victories? Was it Meleander they feared, that was, as it were, pluckt backe from flying away; or the piraticall madnesse of the Sardinians , that were come into Sicily , not so much for Meleander's good, as to seeke pillage and booty out of the warre? If the victory shall happen to vs, said hee, these goodly helpers of his will make all speed to spoyle and robbe Eipercte , and then taking ship againe, seeke other places to doe like mischiefe. But say, they meane faithfully; yet can you thinke, they will euer heartily spend their blouds for men vnknowne, and of another Nation; wee especially, against whom they are to fight, hauing by no iniury prouoked them? They will flye and leaue Meleander to himselfe, if they finde you play the men, if themselues begin to feele what they threaten to vs; and to conclude, if you shall but consider, that in all battels indeed there is danger, but seldome is matter of so great glory offered, as it is for 2. Kings together to be slaine or taken prisoners. Hauing ended these speeches, as the Souldiers passed out of their trenches, he sacrificed a young Dogge, after the Spartane rite (for, he would put his Souldiers in mind from whence they were deriued) to Mars the Enyalius , brother of Bellona : and the Augur, whom hee had hyred, gaue out amongst the Souldiers, that the god was appeased. But the battell was thus ordered: The right wing was led by Menocritvs, Olo odemvs his brother, a great enemy to the King, both by reason of the faction, and for priuate grudge. In the left wing, which was backed with the Fennes, Lycogenes ranged his yong Souldiers, and such as he suspected of his mercenaries, vnder Nabides his command: that hauing no meanes to flye, they might be the better incouraged to conquer. But he himselfe, with his choysest men, was in the main Army, mounted on hors-back, with a stern visage, as one whom so many passions all at once, in this tickle poynt of winning a Crowne, or losing his life, had inflamed. He expected, the enemy should come forward with his troupes all ready, as appeared, put in array, when a horseman appeared comming from Meleanders Army, whom, not far off, a few Souldiers followed, as it seemed, for his guard. Hauing come little more then the mid-way, between both Armies, he staied alone some distance from the rest,  & by his gesture seemed to demand parley. Lycogenes also sent a like number, and one to go before them, fit either for parley, or fight. He imagined, it was some young man of some of equall degree to him, in single combat; when one of those, whom he had sent to know the truth, comes backe, and tels him aloud, that it was a Herald with a white wand,  & his Coat of Armes sent fro Meleander . The whole Army was apparrelled with wonderful expectation, what the armed enemy would say; what league, what commerce between those that with weapons in hand threatned mutuall death each to other. But the Herald, as soone as he had any to heare him; The King, said he, freely pardons all vnaduised rashnes past, if any of you repenting his reuolt, shall before euening come into his Campe. Whatsoeuer is yet offended, no Iustice, no Law shall punish. This pardon hee publiquely vpon his faith and honour confirmes. Hauing thus spoken, he throwes them many scrols, wherein was written to the same effect, and turning his horse, returned to his owne company. More then twenty souldiers heard these words, who being returned to their rankes, there presently rose a muttering thorow the troupes; some questioning, some reporting, what newes the Herald had brought. And Lycogenes chafing to see many of them greedily hearkening to this newes beyond expectation, dissembling his feare; Meleander , said he,  o my Souldiers, is to be obeyed. We must go to him, but yet go armed: and I take this for a signe of good luck, that he inuites our army to his Tents. There is hope, that this day we shall lye in them as Conquerours. Amidst these speeches, while hee was incouraging his rankes, it was told him, that the Kings meant not that day to fight: but they had set part of their Army vpon a little Hill before their Campe, to receiue such as should reuolt from him. But, said hee, I will draw these that would attempt to corrupt our fidelities, to fight: and inforce them to try it out by strength, and not by vndermining treachery. Go euery one to his colours, go, Souldiers, with the gods your fauourers, and subdue those men, that now by their owne confession are too weake for you. But the Souldiers went faintly about this charge. He perceiued them whispering amongst themselues; and in most of them their spirits daunted; especially after Acegoras had first made trial of the Kings promise by yeelding. This was a man of good repute, great in his birth and followers, and had followed therefore, that now the way lay open both for pardon and fauour to him that would first seeke it, he broke out with almost forty Souldiers, and some friends, and hauing got ouer the Field betweene the Campes, at the first Watch in Meleander's Campe layde downe his weapons. And then being brought before the King; I feare not, Sir, said hee, to be taxed with reuolt for this act: for I depart from an vnlawfull warre, to put my selfe vnder a iust command. And this comfort I haue of my offence against you, that being one of the last that ioyned with the enemy, I first returne to my due obedience. The King in few words praising him, and willing him, in regard hee had shewed the way of duety to the rest, to expect his reward, sends him to Archombrotvs . He had charge to see, that vnder colour of reconciliation, worse mischiefe might not bee plotted. Hee therefore brings them into the Field, that lay vnder the command of the Kings Campe, and giuing them his faith for their safetie, places them there disarmed. But to Acegoras and two more, in respect of their noble birth, their weapons were restored, and themselues placed with the Nobility, not farre from the King. But on Lycogenes his party, all men now appeared openly to stagger in their fidelity. Many slipt away vnseene, by winding passages, a great way about. Some followed their fellowes; others drew them with them. At last, raysed with Turues, and there prayed them aloud, that they would at least giue him the hearing, to what he was to say vnto them: For, by what name, said he presently, shall I call you? my fellow Souldiers? or, which I am ashamed of for your owne sakes, my enemies? yet by what title soeuer it be fit to terme you; that no man may call you reuolters or forsakers of your Generall, I here dismisse you: Throw away your obedience: get you home, Countrey-men. Neyther came you to the warre for my sake, but to vse my helpe and counsell. But now I acquit you of your oath: I will no more take you into my protection; since, to doe men good against their will, is often accounted tyranny. I would haue had you safe and Conquerours, and you were now vpon the poynt to be so. Now, by the base confession of your owne cowardize, you doe, as it were, offer your neckes to the vexed and incensed Enemy. What Pan ? what fury,  o Souldiers! hath distraught you of your wits? your most iust cause before absolued you, whom now your vncompelled repentance makes guilty. I pitty your estate much more then I am ashamed of your leuity. Goe then, goe like sacrifices; whether Meleander will haue you die now in his heat of anger, or reserue you to a more secure punishment. I my selfe, with others of vnstayned fidelity, will not yet forsake the Commonwealth: and forgetting how ill you haue this day deserued at my hands, will be reuenged on gods, that they haue beene pleased before the fight, to discerne such fickle and wauering men, from true and valiant Souldiers. You might otherwise, in the midst of the battell, haue disheartened the good Souldiers, whom now by your departure you shall make more famous. For, farre bee it, that the gods should take so little care of Sicily , but that many should still remaine sound and true to their Countrey. And these doe I euen now discerne from the rest, by their eager and cheerefull countenances: and perceiue them to be more moued with indignation at your folly, then with the losse of such companions. With these speeches, he came downe from the Standing, and againe gaue leaue to those that would, to depart. This free speech of their late-beloued Generall, made many of them ashamed. Many therefore kept firme to his party, especially such, as besides this falling from their Prince, knew themselues guilty of other offences: or such, whose pouertie made them feare a beggerly peace, as their greatest punishment. Others, in the meane time, departed from him by tenne in a company, and sometimes by by-wayes, sometimes openly, and the neerest way, went to the Kings Campe. No lesse then fifteene thousand yeelded themselues; Meleander often affirming, that he would haue beene loth to haue bought the victory with the deaths of so many Subiects, as that day had restored him. Tent with those, whose fidelity the defection of the rest had giuen him proofe of. But the Kings hauing thus quickly gotten such faire successe without bloud, were scarcely able to receiue such as came with gratulations; all sorts of people with exceeding ioy, desiring to kisse their Hands, their Clokes, their Horses, and euen the Ground they went on.  A discourse of the bones of a Gyant, and of the Cyclopes . Of the burning of  Ætna . The taking of Anaximander : And the antiquity of Sicily .  accident, which highly pleased the Southsayers: for, as Meleander's seruants were remouing his Tent from an inconuenient place, where it was pitched before, to higher ground, and were making little Ditches, to set vp the Poles in, whereunto the Ropes of the Tent were to be tyed; there were found some bones of a body, as it seemed of a man, but farre surpassing the vsuall proportion of men in that age. And no doubt, but it was the remainder of the ancient Race of the Cyclopes . Presently the Augures made this interpretation, that the power of all Sicily should be subiect to then those Gyants, who now found lying vnder the Kings Pauilion, did also giue vp themselues vnto him. the flattering Prophets shew them the pieces of those huge and monstrous bodies. Radirobanes was more amazed hereat then Meleander , who had before this seene some of these Cyclopes bones. But Radirobanes , that before had esteemed the report of these Cyclopes meerely fabulous, now that both hee himselfe handled their bones, and saw Meleander scarce moued at this sight, as if it were vsuall, began more eagerly to question, what Nation this was of the Cyclopes , what were their manners and customes, whence they were deriued, and how decayed. And Meleander , who had layed the care of the warre and gouernement of the Campe vpon Evrymedes , to shew a kingly magnanimity, cheerefully applyed himselfe to seuerall discourses: and now especially hauing many Sardinians about him, and glad to be questioned of the ancient monuments of his owne Sicily , as they went on towards the Campe, thus began: Some thinke the whole Race of the Cyclopes were wilde, and liued in the Woods: others, that they were not onely worshippers, but euen of the linage of the gods: and that they were the first that possessed this Countrey, and here liued with a simple and sincere gouernement amongst themselues. This is confessed by all, that they were of a larger proportion then ordinary men. And this might perhaps be the cause, that Strangers were deceiued, who at their arriuall here could not belieue, but such huge bodies had wicked hearts: or else not daring to stay any conference with them, being terrified with the sight of them, made all haste from the shore. And, to omit other Arguments, the old Religion of the Greekes moues mee, not to condemne their manners; with whom the custome was to sacrifice to the Isthmus . Whence they had their originall, what were their Lawes, what their actions, the rude Age hath not left to posterity; saue onely that they chiefely frequented the Caues of Æ tna and Lebutium ; and that they are said to be begotten of Neptvne , vpon whom, for the most part, our Ancestors haue fathered all the men of extraordinary huge stature. And wonder not, that there are so few markes of them left vs by Antiquity. For, they raigned heere before Satvrne , since whom haue beene so many Ages, that euen the ruines of Chamasenum , which was the chiefe Towne he built, are not long agoe falne away. Onely the sepulchers of the Cyclopes are left, but euen those, for the most part, in Caues, whose entries now are either changed or sunke with whirlepooles, and ouer-flowing of water; or else couered with heapes of ruines: yet we haue often lighted vpon them vnawares. How huge were those dead trunkes? What a force appeared in those dead foreheads? What visages, to conclude, and how well worthy the fables vsed of them? Not farre from Syracusa , as I went on hunting, when I came into the field which they call Gereates , a Hound, quicke of sent, as if he had found a Deere, stayed questing at the mouth of an vnknowne Caue: when he had drawne vs thither with his continuall barking, I perceiued the horrour of the vnfrequented Caue, at which, as at a sacred place, I trembled. Then my mind gaue me to see more of that, which the gods had offered: and causing the Brambles, as well as we could, to be plucked aside, I looked in, as well as the small light, and that taken onely at that little entrie, would giue mee leaue. The place was of a great depth, and stony steps led to the bottome. Lights were brought vs, and I, with a small company, went vnder the earth, which with the long cold and lonelynesse, seemed to smell something ranke. Hauing passed thorow the narrow entrance, we came at last into a larger Roome. The Caue was exceeding wide and broad. There were high-growne gauell stones, and the hollow Arch of the Caue, which seemed to sweate, shined like a glistering shell, and not vnlike water congealed to ice. In the midst was a huge stone, there placed by Nature, as it seemed by the rootes: but it was loaden with a most prodigious burden. I dare not speake it, my deare Guest: For, why should I hope you will giue mee credit, when I my selfe scarcely beleeue these eyes and hands? Yet will I tell it, be it but to perswade my selfe to that which I saw. There lay vpon the stone, a monstrous huge thing, fashioned in all parts to the shape of a man; onely the greatnesse would not suffer vs to beleeue it a dead body. Wee therefore come but slowly to it, and long it was, before wee put our hands to it; not knowing, whether it were a Monster, or some deity. The head still kept not onely the haires, but the visage vnchanged. His grizly beard, hung downe to his brest, and both his cheekes halfe couered with equall locks of the haire of his head. What shall I say of his thighes? what of his armes? what of his feete? It was a stature well made, (I thought) if the worke-man had so fashioned it: but if it were the worke of Nature, how came wee so weake? how did we, Dwarfes, fall from that proportion? My amazement; after a while, as it often falleth out, leauing mee, I tooke heart to try what it was. But I saw, whatsoeuer part of it came to the touch, fell to dust. This tooke away our doubts, and assured vs, it was the body of a man; and, that the proportion of it might not be defaced, before it should fall in pieces with handling, we tooke exact measure how long it was. Wee all agreed, it was twenty Cubits long. I would haue had it kept as a sacred Relique of one of the old Heroes , and left it vnuiolated. But while I was in this thought, it fell in a moment, with my peoples touching it, all into ashes. There remained onely the hinder part of the head, the great ribs, and the thighes, answerable to the huge weight they had carried. These I commanded to be preserued, (my dearest Guest) and to be hung vp at Syracusa , before Neptvnes Gate; which you will wonder at when you see them. I make no doubt, but it was one of the Cyclopes , the rather, for that the Countrey-men doe sometimes finde whole bodies of the same size in Caues, and sometimes digge vp such bones out of the ground. But I had rather make relation to you, of those which my selfe haue seene. Neither did my Sicilians , as you may perhaps imagine, shew vs these bones by them digged vp, as large as they were, as not knowing that I had often, vpon diuers accidents, seene greater then these; but in regard the Augures took it for a most prosperous Omen , that they were found in that ground that was appointed for my Tent. In this discourse, they came to the place, where the ditchers had found the bones. Radirobanes supped that night with Meleander ; and some of the chief of both their friends admitted to the Banquet. But lo, while they sate discoursing of the penitence of so many Subiects that had returned to the King, and celebrating that dayes happines, there enters a Soldier with Letters to Meleander : hee came from the Gouernour of Catana , with most strange and happy newes. For, Anaximander, Lycogenes his Nephew, had then besieged Catana , one of the faithfullest Cities the King had. But as they were in most extremity of danger, Æ tna suddenly and furiously boyling vp, cast out three streames of light fire, beside great numbers of stones, and heaps of ashes; all which, as if they had beene hired of purpose, were directly driuen into Anaximanders Camp. This discomfiture happened by night: There lay men, and cattell, Engines, Tents, and Armour, and whatsoeuer the torrent of the fire found in his way. Three hundred Soldiers were lost in this: And, Anaximander himselfe, afrighted at this sudden mischiefe, the next day, hauing lost all things necessarie for his purpose, raised the Siege; and as he was carried backe to Lycogenes in his Litter, the Cataneans broke out, and killing as many as presumed to resist, they took him also. Now they sent to be directed from the King, what he would haue them done withall. This newes was heard ouer and ouer; and as well the Guests, as those that waited, so ouercome with suddaine ioy, abstained not from lowd shouts and applauses: which licence the watch at the doore of the Tent following, filled the whole Campe with the spreading gladnesse. There was now no need of the sword, no need of forces; the gods themselues and the elements fought for the Kings. Then were Garlands euery where put on the images of the gods, and flowres throwne vpon both the Kings. The Soldiers, in confused throngs, were bold to enter, not onely the Kings Pauilion, but the Dyning-roome also. Their mirth being somewhat pacified, Radirobanes with an earnest curiosity, demands of Meleander , how that succour came out of Æ tna against Anaximander ; whether it were credible, that from a solid Mountaine, so huge a force of fire should be cast vp; what was this burning in the bowels of the hill; what the Genius ; what the nature of the soyle? Here ; which boyling ouer with his natiue sulphure,  & the wind taken into his bowels, sendeth out a flame (impatient of being kept in) thorow the ruines of his gaping top. Neither doth the top thereof (saith he) burne daily. There is oftentimes a blacke smoke, with long folds infecting the aire: and sometimes you may see sparkes mingled with these darke cloudes. To conclude, it is very seldome, that the fiercer bulging out flames, foulely defaces the neighbouring Region: for, the thicke fire breaking out from the very top, is hurried downeward in violent torrents, spoiling all things it meeteth withall. But then shall you heare lowder thunder than from heauen: and it is the peoples feare, that Æ tna , as huge as it is, will breake in pieces, and ouerwhelme Sicily : nor with lesse wonder, then is answerable to such a roring noise, huge stones are cast vp with this violence, out of the bosome of the Mountaine, into the fields. They are still smokie and sootie, and in all their colour, shew they come from the fire. Then is there such abundance of ashes cast from this fiery mountaines top, that beeing carried many miles off, first, with their own violent eiaculation, and then with the wind, they couer the fields all ouer, and kill the standing corne, or so corrupt the soyle, as it is afterwards vnfit for seed. So, with stones, ashes, and chiefely with flames of fire, not onely droues of cattell, and poore Cottages are consumed. This plague, wheresoeuer it lighteth, destroyeth whole woods. Sometimes whole Townes haue so beene lost. Catana hardly defends it selfe with a continuall Rampire of huge structure and great charge; a City, betweene the Hill and the Sea, fitly seated, were it not for these dangers. It was besieged by Lycogenes his Soldiers. But, as you heare, the gods haue made these fires out of Æ tna , that before were our punishments, now their benefit vpon vs. When Meleander had ended; the matter it selfe, and the merry banquet, drew them into many other discourses. Whatsoeuer was in all Sicily worth the Strangers knowledge, was spoken of. Then begun the pleasingnes of old Fables to put them out of History. What dogs went barking about Sylla ; what the Gulph of Charybdis , and the Coast neuer satisfied with shipwrackes. Then water. Galatea fled from the Cyclops Rockes, not without some feare of the tellers. But at Elis , another Louer cast himselfe into the Sea, to pursue the swift Arethvsa. Eryx was slaine by Hercvles , and Venvs cursed. They had vp religious Stories also, their deuotion toward the gods being earlier stirred vp by the Banquet. In what part of Sicily Plvto broke out to his marriage; what were the markes of his dreadfull Chariot; what Rockes were moued at his boystrous comming vp; where Proserpina was rauished; where her garlands, where her girdle fell; vpon what greene turfe Eleusinians vsurpe others monuments: for, it was not neere Cephissus , but out of Sicily , that Plvto had his way to carry his wife to her dower in the lower shades. Then was told the wandrings of Ceres , and the nightly Religion, with the sacrifices her mad men vsed. The Supper had spent the first watch of the night in these discourses: wherof when the Trumpets gaue them knowledge, Meleander commanded the last course to be taken away. But as they were rising from the Banquet, and offering to with other thoughts. The end of the second Booke. BARCLAY HIS ARGENIS: OR , The loues of Poliarque and Argenis . The Third Booke .  The Enterprize of Lycogenes vpon the Kings Army: the order and disposing of his designe: of the execution thereof, with the death of Lycogenes . The head of Lycogenes brought away by Archombrotvs . The ouerthrow of all the Rebels.  with the frowardnesse of his fortune, and a spirit driuen by necessity, he rowzes himselfe to his last  & greatest resolutions. His now declined fortune, vnlesse suddenly raised, could neuer stand vpright. If he should giue that night to his Soldiers to consider, they would perchance take the safest way: and what, if not content with a bare reuolt, they should seeke reward from the King, by deliuering their Generall bound to him? To men vnfortunate are all enemies. Hee considers there is no hope of fresh supplies, nor are his present forces able to encounter the two Kings. Hee thinkes of trying some sleight of warre, while hee has some Soldiers left to command, and Meleanders Campe are in their iollity. He may perhaps surprize them vnawares; the night being his friend, to double the terrour of his enemy: at least, a suddaine death is happinesse to him that feares worse. Pondering with himselfe these things, hee calls his chiefe Captaines, and shewes them the Enemies Campe. And how thinke you, quoth hee, doe those vndeseruing Conquerours spend the time? They are enfeebled with ioy; and may be offered like Sacrifices in all their trimme. On then; let vs vse the benefit that the flight of our Runnagates will affoord vs; they, by their flying to the enemy, (as if the war were already ended) haue loosened what strength and resolution soeuer they had before: Let vs fall vpon them vnawares; the more they are in number, the more will they encumber themselues in a suddaine tumult. There was no man but highly approued of his purpose; going therefore to their owne Companies, they exhort them to follow where the gods call them on: that now a victory is offered against men not able to beare felicity: they shall fight against drunken and strengthlesse men. They then begin to whet their rage; as knowing themselues of necessitie must suffer wracke, vnlesse they could first put it vpon their enemies. The darknes, and pleasing conceit of ensnaring their enemies, did much encourage them: and many of them, out of hope of pardon by the greatnesse of their offences, were desirous valiantly to dye, or beare away a Noble conquest. When therefore the night was farre spent, deuiding his forces, that they might charge their enemies with greater terrour, they begunne their march. There was an easie way by the open fields, and did leade to the very Pauilions of the Princes: by that way, Lycogenes thought fit to leade his forces. The other way was narrow, but neerer, and was much encumbred with brambles and thornes. This way Menocritvs went with part of the forces, with expresse charge to march on slowly, neither to attempt any thing, vntill hee should vnderstand by the noise, that Lycogenes had set vpon the Court of Guard; and that they then with a great outcry should assault the Trenches; because the Souldiers of that Watch, falling vpon Lycogenes , hee might suddenly possesse that weake quarter, or at least turne from Lycogenes some part of the conflict. More then twelue thousand well appointed Soldiers, marched against especially, being made valiant through necessity. They passed indeed without noyse, vntill suddenly they set vpon the Watch: but then they speedily added whatsoeuer could affright or terrifie them. They had carried many Drummes and Trumpets, of purpose, more then for vse. To these helped a confused cry of all, encouraging each other to the victory. And now the Watch and Ward was driuen backe, when they in the next Tents, amazed with the sudden feare, rise to arme themselues: but the Alarme being giuen thorow the whole Campe, especially they that came from sleepe or wine, confusedly ouerthrew each other; being affrighted, halfe vnarmed, scattered without gouernment, without counsell. What sudden mischiefe should this bee? Who should thus cut throats in the Tents? Whether enemies without, or treason within? Many thinke of fight, more of flight: neither were they able to be gathered to their Colours, being mingled in the hurly burly, and giuing themselues liberty to feare in the nights darknes. Both the noyse, and messengers, at one time brought the report of the Aduersary to the Kings, while they were feasting: neither was there any certaine newes, but that they were fighting in the very Tents. on by his seruants;  & there was the like care taken for Meleander ; to whom Archombrotvs being called for aduice, with an vndaunted countenance said; If you will giue me leaue,  o King, I will this night take vpon mee your danger: What good will it doe you to endanger your selfe in the darke, and in the fight, not knowing where it is, or whence it is? Conuey aside your old age, vpon which the safety of so many men depends, whether it be a reall fight or treason. If it please you, I will take vpon me your fortune, and will vndergoe my selfe what is plotted against your person. Grant me your Armes and your Iacket: you your selfe passing with some of the choyce Soldiers, by the Gate which is farthest from the Enemy, shall preserue your selfe from necessary dangers. This deuice pleased Meleander , and admiring his fidelity, that would preuent the Kings danger with his owne hazzard, he deliuereth to the Youngman his Royall Armes: hee himselfe in vnknowne Armes, slippeth out of the Gate, with very few in his company. Archombrotvs glittering in his Princely habit, passed out of his Tent with those which were priuie to the deceit,  & was carried where the noyse of fighting men did draw him. His haste, and because his voyce, being shut vp within his helmet, did not keepe its naturall tone, kept those that heard him, from knowing him not to be Meleander . But as soone as hee rushed into the battell, all being stirred vp, not so much against the Enemy, as in defence of the King, made haste to his succour. whence, after hauing thither gathered a great number of his men, made diuers furious sallies vpon his enemies. In the narrow passage between the Tents was the fight hottest. In this conflict, three fell vnder Archombrotvs sword, at as many blowes: They who were about him, beleeuing indeed the old King had beene thus strong, followed him fighting with like force, through their excessiue gladnesse. The Enemies, terrified with this violence, began to turne their backes towards the Bulwarke; when Menocritvs is heard out of another part of the Campe, doubling the terrours of the conflict and the night, with lowd shouting of his men. The Soldiers appalled with this doubtfull and vncertaine misery, could hardly relieue the King, when Radirobanes valiantly turned himselfe to that part of the danger: hee therefore encountring Menocritvs , beateth him backe, and all his company. But they, hindred neither with danger nor wounds, were stopped onely by death: sometimes aduancing against the assailants; sometimes couered with each others Bucklers, and with their strong Targets falling backe to their Rampires. Heere was a terrible shew of all things; Heere Archombrotvs receiued Lycogenes , hauing already entred the Tents: there, Radirobanes charges vpon Menocritvs . The night was dangerous on both sides, making it doubtfull, by reason of the dark, what they should chiefly oppose or defend; vntill Lycogenes set on fire the next Tent, warning his Soldiers to doe the like on euery side: burning his enemies with their baggage, and giuing himselfe light to the victory. On the other side, the Kings Souldiers brake downe the neighbour Tents in the middest of the fire, lest it should increase and bee dispersed farther. And a showre of raine also did helpe their care; which falling in some violence, hindred the mischiefe: and also the ground beeing slippery, faultred vnder the Souldiers feete, hindring the certainety of their strokes. The night spent with much slaughter on both sides, so many bodies lying dead before them, such a streame of blood, and all things desolate with slaughter, droue them, being hot and violent, into greater fury; as if they had but then entred the combate, they plyed with all their force, and the cruelty of the fight seemed rather a spleene of each particular man, than a maintaining of publike sides. And now Meleander was impatient longer to absent himselfe from the danger of his Soldiers. Daring therefore the vttermost, hee commanded notice to be giuen to Archombrotvs , that he was ready to giue them battell. But, quoth hee to Evrymedes , if the King shall come with his Troupes,  o workes will not receiue so many fighting men: it will be better to draw out some of these which we haue with vs, who may encompasse them behind, by winding about. For, why do our Horsemen stay behind? why be our Archers detained within their Tents? Evrymedes willingly agrees with done: and then leading part of the forces by the backward workes, he ioyneth with him to enclose the Enemy. enuironed) yet he would not turne from his enemies which hee had in front, to goe against Meleander , lest it should bee counted a flight: but sends strait charge to Menocritvs , that with all speed he should drawe his copanies thither. Which he obeyed. Radirobanes pursuing him behind, led part of his army with him. It was a large Field, and fit to set a battell in array. Menocritvs therefore, surprized there betweene Meleander and Archers, and Sicilian Horse at length preuailing in plaine Skirmish; the Horsemen, by coursing vp and downe; and the Archers by keeping their stand, did gaule them farre and neere. But then Lycogenes , knowing if decided, gnashing his teeth, and halfe frantike, drawes all his forces thither to releeue him; but by a winding course, that he might inuade Meleander on the one side, and that Archombrotvs might not haue the aduantage to assaile him in the Reare. Neither did Archombrotvs lesse quickly discouer his countenance; I am, saith hee, I am, fellow Soldiers, Archombrotvs ; the gods haue done well for mee, that being more fortunate then Patroclvs , vnder my betters Armes I haue deceiued mine enemies. I haue taken these Armes which you see, by the Kings command, to secure him from the danger of the night. If you will haue him aliue, Lycogenes is twice to be vanquished; for now he bendeth himselfe against the King, not so much, that hee hopeth for the victory there, as because he is heere vanquished. Goe on, and free your King from the violence of a mad dying man. This said, he issues forth, where the Trench was broken downe by Lycogenes ,  & the Soldiers with shouting followed their Leader: but it prooued a most deadly Skirmish. The Troups in their turnes did retire and aduance, the Colours were scattered heere and there, beeing no Vangard, no Reare, no wings or body of a battell. Heapes of dead men lay euery where, and the liuing fought through the wounds of the dead. Meleander , valiant beyond his yeeres, so plyed it like a Soldier, that hee seemed to forget he was a Generall. About him Evrymedes and Arsidas bestirred themselues in the fight, with excellent prowesse, defending their King. But Radirobanes , by his innate valour, and incensed by the hope of his reward, left nothing vnattempted. Sometimes, he brake the tankes of his enemies, sometimes, not content with common danger, hee ranne dreadlesse where he perceiued most need. Yet did not the Enemy giue backe: fury, and a guilty conscience for their wrong to the King, made them seeke a more noble death in the middest of the battell. Lycogenes , easily knowne by his Armour, shewed himselfe in the thickest of his Troupes, riding thorow his squadrons; praysing some, and checking others, as their actions deserued; and where any part did wauer, or faint, brauely relieuing it with the death of his Enemy. At length, Archombrotvs , in the very heat of the fight, tooke courage to the greatest and highest exploit in the Field. He was set on fire, hauing the charge of those whom he led, to Timonides , who was next him: he himselfe, with some choyce, violently rusheth where Lycogenes did most annoy his enemies. him. First, Archombrotvs bending his Iauelin at his bosome, but, not piercing his Shield, receyued from him, but without harme, a strong blow with a Pollaxe. Both of them angry with their hands for fayling, and their weapons in vaine lighting, raged with deadly fury. And while they re-double blowes, seeking passages thorow each others Armour, Archombrotvs , impatient of delay, reynes his Horse as neere as he could, intangling Lycogenes with a suddain graspe, and is also forcibly held by him. While they are thus struggling, they fall down to the ground together: and in the very fal, him. Most of the Souldiers in a rout runne vpon them thus wrastling, some, to helpe Archombrotvs ; others, Lycogenes. Lycogenes struggled vpon the Sand, Archombrotvs holding him fast by the Legge and Shoulders. But and many blowes, nor suffering him to rise beeing downe, redoubles his stabbes with a short Dagger, at the bottome of his Coat of Maile, vntill he perceiued him lye dead at his feet. But when both sides perceiued Lycogenes was dead, a great and different noyse arose amongst them. These, reioycing for the victory; the others, sending forth fearefull groanes, to thinke how neere their death did approach. already dismayed,  & disperseth terrour & dread thorow their whole Campe: so that shaking aloft Lycogenes his head by the haire, being parted from his body, hee suffered them not to doubt of their ouerthrow; and afterwards, casting it at Meleander's feet; said, Behold Lycogenes , now quiet, O King, and whom thou mayest safely trust: and let the test of thy enemies, if they refuse thy mercy, proue the gods iudgemets by the like end. Meleander commanding Lycogenes his head to be kept, marcheth on against his faint and fearefull enemies: for now here was seene no skirmish in the Campe, but a full discomfiture: no body daring to indure the face of the Conquerour, or heare Menocritvs calling them backe: Some flye to the top of the mountaines; others, knowing the passages, hide themselues in Caues; and most wander at randome, whither feare  & fortune leades them: and some fainting with flight, fell to the ground; afterwards trodden vnder foot by the pursuing Horsemen: no aduantage wanted to their destruction. Radirobanes pursuing of his Helmet. Neyther did he fight cowardly, though he were preuented in his escape, vntill being taken and suddainely bound, he had neyther leisure to hurt his enemy, nor himselfe. It was night before all returned to now ended, spent that night in his Tents, much spoyled by the last nights inuasion. But the distraction of the last night, held the reines to their present mirth, placing in euery corner Watch and Ward, lest any new vprore should arise. mood was put into a po etick vaine: the violence of his ioy forcing him to that voluntary fury, which confoundeth the rauished inuention of Poets with the gods: whether therefore he could first gratulate the Kings fortune, or gaine credit for his speedy indeuours, perchance, that he might quell babling Poets, who would (no question) racke the victory, if they were not presently drouen away; in a few houres hee made these Verses, and gaue them to his Sonne, as yet a Youth, who should deliuer them to the King the next morning, as his owne:  We haue o'recome: the gods at length haue heard Iust prayers, and sent vs health; Iove does regard The earth: all Temples, and all Altars now Let's honour, and a Garland crowne each brow. And our Sicilian mindes with fury led. Though cruell, he loues warres, and weapons dy'de In humane bloud to see, where ere he ride, Fury, and sheuer'd Speares in death imbrew'd; Yet these sad slaughters with remorse hee view'd, Now first abhorring fight, since earth durst skar The Heauens themselues, with her proud Gyants war; When hid in Ægypt the poore gods did sweat, Now hot in minde, and lookes with anger great, His right hand shakes his horrid Lance, his left Puts on his furious Steedes: Thrace now he left, And Hellespont , and on the lofty clifts Of our Pachinos , his seene Chariot lifts. That time it was, when the ioyn'd Armies stroue, Displaying their sad colours, whether Iove Or Erebvs should in this Kingdome reigne: And now, O King, thy party to maintaine, Came armed Mars , in a swift clowd conceal'd; But in his full carriere he stopt, and held His brandisht Dart, when scarce could he allay His Horses fire, or his prone Chariot stay. Then thus he spake; What Warres are these I see? Shall I reioyce or grieue? They need not mee: That side I came to ayde, shall ouerthrow Their foes, and nothing to my succour owe: Vertue her selfe fights for her seruants here. What sacred hoary Maiesty appeares Vnder yon Helme? reuerend in minde and yeares, Fight'st thou, old King, and want'st not yet a foe? If Satvrne had his starry Palace so Defended once; had he knowne so to fight, And from himselfe th'approaching dangers fright, Conceal'd in Italy he had not rang'd, Nor vnder Iove the golden Age bin chang'd. But oh! what hearts, what courages are those Equall to ours? What more then mortall blowes Their Lances deale? Conquering in midst of foes, They force the Field: What equall light affords Both Helmes? and death flyes equall from both swords. Both here are Forrainers: both triumphs bring To Meleander , our Sardinia's King: Th'other from Lybia comes: braue Progeny Of heauen, goe on: Fame, to posterity Shall speake your deedes; whil'st sau'd by your strong hand, This Iland shall th'encroaching Sea withstand. What other Chiefes; what Souldiers doe I spy Deseruing Heauen? goe swift-wing'd victory, Their honor'd sweat with thy faire Lawrell dry; Goe willingly, and borne in triumph so Thy selfe, and those great Kings to th'people show. So spoke great Mars ; the foes disranked fled Through deuious paths: their Captaines ghastly head Was prickt vpon the Lybian Princes Speare. A shout then more than humane rends the aire. The gods reioyce; the Furies howle to heare. This Phoebvs told me; but the tumult tooke Out of my minde the rest that Phoebvs spoke. The King, though busie, as he was dressing in the morning, perused these Verses, iesting with Nicopompvs , why he would part with his owne praise to his young, and yet ignorant sonne. Hee sent them to Radirobanes , to know whether he might yet be visited: and long after, with the traine of his Nobility, he goeth to his Pauilion. Hee, although hee were mindefull more then enough of the ayde which hee had brought to Sicily , and of his diuulged fortitude, yet in the middest of this height of his proud iollity, consumed with spleene which hee bore to Archombrotvs , for the conquest of most courteously commending the fauour receiued from him, and imputing to the Sardinians the weight of the victory. Our victory (saith hee)  o Guest, was from thy hand: when I shall vse those things restored by thee, I shall oftner remember that I haue receiued them from thee, then thou shalt thinke that thou bestowedst them. In the meane time, inioy what is gayned by thy helpe, and thou maist easily vnderstand by the excessiue ioy of the people, how beneficiall thou hast beene vnto vs. Although Radirobanes verily perswaded himselfe that the King spoke in earnest, yet he openly forbad him thus to burden his bashfulnesse: for to the cause, and Meleanders happinesse, he owed it all: and that he had receiued a benefit, which hee was to defend with his strongest deuotion.  comming into the Field after the victory. The Funerals of them that were slaine on Meleander's part.  come to the Campe: Shee, the day before, from the walls of Eipercte , as little spared her teares, as the Souldiers did their bloud: being pale, and neuer counting her selfe more happy, then when feare had taken away her sence. Sometimes did she yeeld to griefe, and then strengthen her selfe with hope, while she sent messengers to know the true state of the battell. Yet angry, as shee thought of him. Had I rather, my deare, that thou shouldst know my teares, and the perplexity of my doubtfull thoughts, then that they should be concealed from thee as they are? Thou wouldst dye surely at the memory of my miseries. But if thou shalt heare that Argenis is taken, or freed from her enemies shame, by her owne hand, and her owne wound; O villanous deed! O vnhapply Loue! not yet freed by death, and am now fresh wounded by thy fate. But art thou gone, Poliarchvs ? shall I accuse thee, or some vnfriendly god for thy slownesse? What forgetfulnesse is this? What obliuious fruit hast thou tasted in Africa , which detaineth thee so long? Doth not thy Genius tell thee what businesse hath beene done here? or, can the hatred of my Father preuaile more with thee, then the bands of our old loue? and thou which canst not be out of action, whether, O vnkindnesse! hast thou found danger more aduantagious? Hadst thou beene present, Poliarchvs ; hadst thou fought against my Enemy, the victory were sure, my Father would owe to thy valour both Sicily , and my selfe, which now thou dost suffer eyther to miscarry, or to bee anothers glory: For if thou hadst beene willing, the Elements, Chance, or Nature, had not preuented thy returne. After this chiding, shee altered her resolution, as though she had committed sacriledge by being thus angry with Poliarchvs . It was griefe and care enough to her, that her Father was in the battell. If Poliarchvs had beene put in the like danger, she had not been able to haue paid her debt to so much griefe. O you Destinies! said shee, you did wish me well, that in so eminent dangers, at least, I feare not for Poliarchvs , while hee liueth, while he is safe, why should I count my selfe miserable? Or, why doe I so much feare; as if he could proue faithlesse to me, or the gods vniust to him? The newes of the enemies flight, though herselfe had seene it, raised her courage, while shee was spending teares in this and the like discourse, which she couered vnder a Vaile. Then, suffering Selenissa to speake to her, and the rest of the Ladies which were about her, to gratulate with her. The people also following her, in her returne to the Palace, shew'd excessiue signes of ioy, according to their accustomed loue. The next day, with the greatest part of the Citizens, she went to the Campe. But lest her ioy should be absolute, there was raised a generall report, that there was a match treated vpon, between her selfe and Radirobanes , the people beleeuing, and reioycing, as at a thing pleasing Argenis . The King imbraced her coming, with teares of affectionate loue; O my daughter, quoth he, I now hold thee as vndoubted Heire of Sicily : they are gone, who against the Law of Nations would haue wrested the Kingdome to theselues. Then, casting his eye towards the tutelar deities of Sicily . By the prouidence of the gods,  & his vertue, we are now establisht in our Kingdom. Then highly comending & especially the strangers. Argenis discreetly thanked the all; and receiued againe their gratulation; turning only her selfe, as much as she could, or was seemly, fro the coplements of Radirobanes , whom she feared. to bury the dead bodies of such as were slaine: for now the Army, both of their own accord,  & by the aduertisement of the Priests, dispersing themselues about the businesse, readily performed their last act of piety towards the dead. Some cut downe Trees, others brought them, the rest prouided Beds of grasse. By these their seuerall labours, the Funerall piles are suddenly raised: vpon these piles, orderly lay the Hearses of the common people: for the bodies of the chiefe Nobility, their kindreds loue had conueighed away in Litters, to more honourable interment. They adorne therefore their Hearses, according to the military pompe, with the spoyles of their enemies; that amongst weapons and armes of all sorts, they might stand for trophies. They that foud priuate friendship, their wounds washed with water, and anoynted according to euery ones means, expected their last Funerals. Each of them had a Garland made of Parsley, because it was fit for the Conquerour, and the dead: for they loued to put this Hearbe into graues, and the Grecians did crowne the Conquerours, in many exercises, with this reward. A great number of women and children flockt together, and began freely to honour the Funerall, by wayling & tearing their haire, that it should seeme, teares were not hyred; whether they did bewayle their kinsfolk, or the griefe of their spectacle, or the example of so many mourners, had giuen them the same willing power of sheading teares. The Funerals thus composed, Meleander in mourning attyre comes out of his Tent: the Army followed the King, trayling their Pikes, and dragging them carelesly on the ground. In this mourning manner, went they seuerall times about the fields, commanding sometimes great shouts and cryes, then a deepe and fearefull silence. The King then came to the greatest pile, holding in his hand a fire-brand lighted, vntill the whole company had called vpon the names of their dead fellowes. Hauing thrice named them, with his face couered, turning his backe, hee puts vnder the fire. Radirobanes did the like at the other pile,  & Archombrotvs at the third. The fire soone seized on the rest, by the last good office of their friends. But the angry and incensed Souldiers did most seuerely punish the captiues: they spared indeed their own country- men: but strangers, who had serued vnder Lycogenes , were brought bound to the Funerall, where, through many wounds, their bloud was let out to sprinkle the fire. The conquering Souldiers inuoked the soules of their companions to this cruell comfort: vntill the King, detesting their hellish cruelty, commanded the captiues which were yet liuing, to be kept, as if it had beene for other punishments: But for the bodies of the enemies, left by the Aires infectio, they should after their death also proue hurtfull, the comon Sergeants are sent with hooks to throw them into the next pit of water, or Ditch, vnburied. The company somewhat quieted, and the Funerall piles almost burnt out, as befitted a King, praised those whose Funerals they had then solemnized; hee called them Conquerors, and happy in death, who dying in the midd'st of honour, should not indanger to staine their true praises by any misery or misfortune: that they did beare the triumphing rewards for short paine; they should be acceptable to the gods, and remaine renowned vpon earth, as long as any could sound a Trumpet. And then, turning himselfe to the praises of the Souldiers about him, he thanked them for their extraordinary paines, and faithfull constancy: That the gods, prowesse, a good conscience, and the memory of a gratefull posterity, are the chiefe reward of valiant men. It should be furthermore his especiall care, that they should thinke their labour well bestowed vpon a King that would be euer mindefull of it. Hee bids them lay their mourning now aside, and follow to the City to more ioyfull solemnities. His seruants were there of purpose present, who at these words (for the Priest sprinkled holy-water) should take off his mourning Robes, and put him on a triumphing Garment. Some there began to sing the P aean , robbing euery prosperous Flowre or Tree to carry in their hands, and make themselues Garlands.  The ill order of the Captaines. The Kings entring into Eipercte . The griefe of Argenis for Poliarchvs his absence: Shee resolues with  Souldiers to Eipercte : neither did he thinke it fit to goe in triumph, because the victory was of his Subiects: yet his returne was very like a triumph; for the Souldiers had put on Garlands of Bayes, and, which signified triumph, adorned their heads with Oliues. The Army marching before with their colours, and by their seuerall musicke, inuoked the gods to the sight of their iollity. They set Meleander in a Chariot, beautified with all the markes of honour and victory; to which, when he inuited Radirobanes , there continued a long complement betweene them: Radirobanes alledged this place to be fit onely for Argenis ; that the princely Virgin should sit by her Father: both of them should sit in the eie of the people, and both of them receiue their loue and praises, that the gods and Fortune had fought for them: but for himselfe, if they would, hee wished rather to ride on a Horse that might be led close by them; if not, he would follow next to the Chariot. It was easily perceiued in the ambitious young man, that loue and the hope of marriage drew him to this courtesie. But when Meleander could not perswade him to come into the Chariot, or stay till another was made ready; he himselfe would not be carried. Then, not onely by the consent of the Nobility, but the generall desire of the shouting Souldiers, was Argenis alone seated in it. The Kings rode before the Chariot, their horses also adorned with Lawrell. Before them rode Archombrotvs on a white horse, reining him with the left hand, & in his right bearing the best spoyle, the head of Lycogenes : on which the people looked merrily, knowing that from thence did grow the victory. Chaines. The Pretorian, and chiefe Souldiers, gathering as well about the Chariot where Argenis was carried, as about the King; for the greater honour of the young Lady, had neglected their triumphant freedome and conceits, and more solemnely inuoked the bridall god Hymen, Ivno and the Sicilians thought, there was an agreement betweene the Kings concerning the marriage, they were forward to entertaine the thoughts of their succeeding Prince, with these sports. But Argenis could not with patience heare this, scorning the victory, if she must buy it at such a rate, and now almost turned enemy to Radirobanes . In the meane time, the people had hang'd their doores with lights & lawrel: whosoeuer kept in Wax the statues of their Ancestors, opening now their displayed pedigrees, inuited the images of their dead fathers to be sharers in this their gladnesse. The Citizens distinguished in their companies, went forth to meet Meleander . The first troupe was of children in white nappy garmets, sounding out of their childish P aean , more then they were bid; then as many as were skill'd in musicke, some singing, others playing on Harpes & Dulcimers to the King: the Company of Crafts-men followed next; after whom came the Magistrates, euery one in their Robes of dignity. These, entertaining the King with a long cogratulatio, gaue place to the Priests, who came last, as most honourable. Some of them carried Images, & their old gods of rude workmanship; others, Crownes, all fire; safely, & not without the merry conceit of the wiser sort, calling to minde the good Omens of the gods; That Lycogenes his death, by the flight of Birds, intralls of Beasts, and obseruation of lightning, had bin fore-declared. In the midd'st of this solemnity, the King came to the City-gate, in the entrance wherof, they had aloft erected the Image of Peace, in whose right hand Mars had put an Oliue-branch: and the Table vnder the picture, vnseasonably flattering, as if all troubles in Sicily were now quieted: in these Verses bespake the King;  Thy Countries Father; come with conquest home; With thee Peace festiually clad is come, With snowy wings, see Piety descends From heauen, and all the gods returne thy friends. See, Concord quite has chang'd this Kingdomes face, Peace and rich labour mutually grace The ground againe, cloathing the Fields with Corne And Grasse: behold, the Elmes doe wooing turne; To whom their loue the diuor'st Vines renew: Warres threats, and licence of the Sword, adieu. Ascend, O King, thy Ancestors high Throne, And let the Lawes sit arm'd with thee alone. The King goeth forward from the gate, into the high Temple of Ivpiter , from thence Menocritvs is sent to prison, and Anaximander with him, whom the Catanensians had a little before brought bound (but he within foure daies dyed of his wounds, and the other not long after, of anguish of minde.) shall not be lawful, so much as to keep them priuate, or to be seene or carried hereafter for the honour or Funerals of any of his Family. Hauing then ended the Sacrifice, Meleander setteth forward to the Castle: weary he was with the former daies fight  & care, & afterwards with very ioy. He retyres therfore into his chamber, & making a light supper amongst his houshold officers, he settleth himselfe to rest. The like solitarinesse from their deepe cares, vnder pretence of sleepe, did Radirobanes, Archombrotvs , and of rash confidence, yet tooke heauily the valour and successe of But yet he scorn'd him, as being his inferiour: except that great loue doth feare all things. Entring therefore into a full view of himselfe, how much he had bin helping by his valour and power, he is lulled in a pleasant dreame, representing vnto him the forme of the happy battell. But Archombrotvs was wounded deeper, hauing made triall, that nothing is a greater Tyrant, then the thing men call Sweet loue. Neyther did he thinke, that Fortune did hurt him so much, as his owne silence. That he was counted for a priuate man, while he suffered his birth and power to be concealed. He could not better aduise himselfe, then to lay open to Meleander his fortunes and desires: determining thus with himselfe, his mothers commands forbad him, and his oathes to the gods, that he would not discouer his birth while he liued in Sicily . Whether therefore it were better to write to his mother, or to goe himselfe to be absolued of his oath? he thought both of them too slacke. Yet his resolution of writing did best please him; for a man would not be so long absent from Sicily , which deserued to loue Argenis . In this perplexity of minde, negligently tossing on a restlesse bed, he did now enough perceiue, how the malady of the minde infecteth the body. But Argenis dismayed with so many miseries, vseth the comfort of her Nurse this? what difference, whether Lycogenes or Radirobanes had the conquest. But that my Father, sau'd from the Sword of Lycogenes , should dye by my paricide: For if hee giue mee to Radirobanes , I shall by my death free my selfe, and with the griefe thereof, kill my aged Father. I am therefore borne eyther for a prey, or for a spoyle and reward of victory. The Fates then gaue mee their greatest gifts, onely for my destruction, my beauty, and Kingdome. And did I therefore onely come to know Poliarchvs , that I might know my selfe vnworthy to be wedded to so much vertue? But what dost thou thinke, Selenissa , is the occasion of his stay? May be, he lurketh some-where in priuate, and perhaps in this Iland, to make proofe of my constancy. May be, the valiant Gentleman (and therefore not to bee suspected) is intrapped by some treachery. But whom may I now trust? whom may I send to enquire of his safety, and relate my miseries? And now melting into teares, she hearkened to Selenissa , giuing her more comfort, then she her selfe conceiued or beleeued: vntill hauing regained power to speake, she said: I am not the first, o Selenissa , which haue loued vnfortunately. Why do we yeeld to fortune? Death shall be the last remedy, which I can neuer be hindred from. May I not go my selfe, changing my habit, in search of no face to frame a lye. And perhaps also (but that is my least feare) I might dye in the labour of trauell. Besides, thou could'st not follow mee, nor stay behind, without being called into danger, if I should slip away without the Kings priuity. Hearke, what I take to be the best course. Archombrotvs , you know, is a most especiall friend of Poliarchvs ; hee defended him in his absence to the King, and was the chiefe perswader to call him backe: I shall easily perswade him to seeke out Poliarchvs , and bring him backe to Sicily : yet he shall not know what the cause is I desire to see him; somewhat else may be deuised, neither will our faction want the colour of truth, when both of vs shall enforce his beliefe. Selenissa praised her wit; whether the cunning did please her, or being weary, desired some respit from griefe to herselfe and Argenis for the rest of the night, which vttering some few words about Lycogenes death, commanding him openly, to aske of Archombrotvs , if that night had any thing eased him of his wounds, (for hee had receiued many, but they were light:) for she studied how to flatter him, hauing dangerous imployment for so deseruing a Gentleman. confident that hee was beloued, answered her Chamberlaine; If Meleander and Argenis were well, (for vpon their safety he wholly depended) hee himselfe was well enough. O the minds of men! for the most part fearing their delights, and louing their miseries. The Young-man, now full of ioy, and ignorant of Argenis deuice, tyred his mind with vaine thoughts, and stood by her Chamber doore, to present his seruice, as she came out. Neither came she vnwelcome; and all the way talking with him, as shee was going to businesse was not ripe, and secresie was requisit for that discourse. But behold fresh mistakes; Radirobanes not free from loue, had hyred some about the Court, who should daily bring him news of Meleander and lodging, that Argenis , early in the morning, had sent to Archombrotvs , that he came presently to her, and what familiar discourse shee had with him. His suspition presently grew vehement, and as in doubtfull happinesse, hee bent his mind no otherwise now to loue, then before to warre. Grinding his teeth, he went aside with Vertiganes , pondering by what sleight or meanes great a King to feare a priuate and vnknowne man for his Cortinall. perswaded him that day to breake with Meleander (with whom he promised to dyne) that he desired to be his Son-in-law; and then despised Archombrotvs should be punished to the full for his madnesse: with whom if Radirobanes should be angry more heauily and openly, it would be too great a comfort to his punishment, that so great a King was iealous of him.  A discourse betweene the King and Cleobvlvs , about the troubles of the State, and of the meanes to keepe the State in quiet.  businesse; for there were some remnants of warre, which were not to be neglected, Siracusa, Lylib aeum, Agrigentum , and what other Cities had stood for Lycogenes . Hee asked Cleobvlvs counsell, whether it were better to deuide his Army, to besiege them all at once, or to march against each of them with his full power. Hee doubted not but that the Citizens would yeeld, because there was now left no worthy head to the faction. It is sufficient, saith hee,  o King, if you would continue a while your threates, and make a little shew of your armed troupes, onely that feare might hasten the Townesmens repentance, from whom, within these few dayes, you shall haue heere Embassadours. For, being mad, not out of their owne dispositions, they will loue to returne to that nature, which rebellion had before shaken off. Feare not you haue finished this warre; but the true cause thereof was not in the Cities; and if hereafter you loue your safety, there are farre other heads of this mischieuous spring, which you must damme vp. many late mischiefes, We must, saith hee, haue an especiall regard, that this recouered health of the Common-wealth bee of long continuance: neither may wee euer more safely then now, while the scarres be fresh, take away all strength and meanes of annoyance, by which being wounded a little before, we may againe be endangered by fortune. But if in the heate of danger, thou hadst laid before mee my former faults, thou wouldst haue seemed rather to haue vpbraided than admonished mee: But now I am in safety, if thou truely tell mee what thou dost thinke, Cleobvlvs ; hereafter it shall be a warning, that I fall not into the same lapse. Hee, fearing with too sawcy a freedome to anger the King, though seeming desirous, excused him of all blame: That it was the fault of his enemies, the times and Fates. And when with that modestie, he had prepared the Kings mind for that counsell, which he was ready to giue him; As long, saith hee, as gentlenesse is counted for a vertue, you cannot be said to haue brought faltring Sicily into any misfortune by your fault: Your clemency, I say, the enuy of the Fates haue abused, to the ruine almost of your selfe and Countrey. That easinesse, and too much sufferance toward your Nobility; that lauish and rash bounty of your selfe and your Ancestors, hath betrayed the chiefe strength of your Kingdome, and laid open to iniuries your contemned dignity. But now they are vanquished, and now their tyred factions will bee at rest. But when they shall gaine breath a little, looke for other stormes, except you, Æ olvs -like, can bridle their ambitious winds. They will striue to breake forth, and as long as they haue too much power, you Kings can neuer haue enough. Neither doe I counsell you to bee a Tyrant. You shall also prouide well for them, o King, if you shall bring to passe, that through the feare and hatred of their fault, they should by little and little forget their restlesse dispositions. I know, saith power of these men are growne vp already, and by the forbearance and patience of Kings, almost now made lawfull. In abating them, therefore, I shall either be thought to doe an iniury, in beating downe that power, which had beeing before mee: or else may, by too much striuing, make a rash tryall of the Royall power, which has been oft violated, and the weakenesse whereof it behooues vs to conceale. Hope better of the successe, (replyes Cleobvlvs ) while you may root out in order and by degrees, that plentifull power, that makes them so to swell. Neither doe you beleeue, that your cause is ill, and that gods and men disallow it, if you fight for your Princely honour, and preuent Sicily from parricide, by which she sacrifices her selfe to the Furies. Marke who they are, and from whence they come, and what Engines haue raised them to this their height. Howsoeuer they may bragge, they got estates by the fauour of your Ancestors; they are put into gouernments, and by your especiall grace and princely sufferance, haue they mounted so high, that now, either they or their posterity doe striue against their Kings. Yours therefore are the weapons with which your selfe are assaulted; yours are all those swords, which (guided by the blind hand of discord) doe vow the ruine of their first makers. If they deserue it, and know not when they are well, take that onely from them, which they first receiued from you. Trust mee, you shall leaue them naked, and make them forget that haughtinesse, which they now swell with, admiring in themselues your wealth, and ignorant of their owne pouerty. And to the end you may take heed to your Honour in time, marke how much their power doth increase against you: how openly, with how dangerous a consent, they doe now challenge to themselues, as it were, this freedome of sinning. They will be  aemulous competitours, nay, enemies one to the other, yet they will hardly suffer the King to crush any of them. Whosoeuer therefore rebelleth, the rest haue a hand in the Treason, either openly, or in their priuate wishes. Now they will ioyne with the faction, now they will take the benefit of the time being well offered, that vnder another pretence of difference, they may distract the King. Others doe not leaue your side, nor your Campe, but the vse of the Kings Councels and Souldiers being weakned by degrees and circumstances, they desire that the obstinacy of the Rebels might hold long play with the Kings forces, lest the danger should seeme vnfit, and vnworthy of Kings, and the people may be accustomed to reuerence, and suffer these vproares. So they both make a patterne to themselues, and prepare a good way, if they shall happen to fall out with the King. Vnlesse you preuent this treason by speedy policy, what will you differ from the fortune of Mergania ? It was a powerfull Countrey vnder the subiection of one, but now, by the sluggishnesse and weakenesse of their Emperours, it is falne to the rule of so many, that it is altogether reuolted from the right Lord. Though it be fresh in your memory, Sir, what such factions are able to doe, yet you haue heere giuen me leaue to shew you their originall and nature. For I would haue you thorowly fired, or prepared with patience to suffer a certaine calamity. If therefore you loue any, or preferre any, against the pleasure of the ancient Nobility; as if it were of their goods what you giue; they leaue the Court, complaine that they are neglected, they fly to the Castles and Garisons, which you haue trusted to their charge. They bewayle the fortune of the people; that a few horse-leeches are filled with the blood of a dying Kingdome; that their pride is not to be endured, who abuse the bewitched King, and trample vnder-feet the ancient and deseruing Nobility, with an vnusuall pride of their new power. This (as you know) is the common course of reuolting, and breaking out into ciuill warres. But there are other causes which embolden these kind of people to sedition; though you haue long bin bountifull to them, yet if at any time you stay your hand; if you deny offices or gouernments to them already full, though neuer satisfied; if you commit not all your counsels to them; if you haue any in better esteeme then themselues; if you hate not where they hate; they thinke they are vsed vnworthily, and storme, as if some indignity were offered them. Others, that they may gaine to themselues reputation, and teach the King how powerfull they are, for no other cause they seeke matter of offence, and disturbe the common peace. But what occasion soeuer moueth them to reuolt, being enabled with that power, which you gaue them, they find presently clyents and followers; and so much the freer, because these faults of going out, are commonly vnpunished, and oftentimes rewarded. Being thus heartened, and, as it were, settled in their owne Kingdome, they wrest from you, Kings, richer things to make peace, then if they had beene dutifull and faithfull. In the meane time, with your gold, and your wages, (Who can suffer it?) they muster those forces which they leade against you. Being bold vpon your treasure, they will either haue an account from you of your Raigne, or wil prescribe a forme of gouernment to you. They are your Farmers and your Citizens, which are more polled by these warres, then by forraigne inuasions. What then? you must buy your peace ( o King.) It is to their benefit to doe amisse. You, while the Kingdome is not hartily settled, expect still in feare, from what ashes the flame should breake out againe; who shall be ambitious of the next reuolt; what articles of agreement must be added to the already too full Records. This I account the least of all, that these warres, and these agreements, should be a scoffe to forraigne Countries; and whether we haue peace or dissention, our faith is more vnconstant then the waues of the Sea. The wounds are greater, by which they pierce thorow the bowels of their Countrey, by such customes. For, the strength of the greatest Countrey, to which, if these inconueniences were taken away, no Kingdome but would yeeld, this malignant continuall wind doth beate to the ground. The wealth of the Citie and Countrey is wasted, wheresoeuer this storme lighteth. The vigour of the mind is wasted; and the carefull wisedome of their Councellors which deserue to bee noted thorow the world, can hardly haue leisure to appease these differences at home. Furthermore, the minds of the yonger sort are brought vp in boldnesse, contempt of your Maiestie, and delight in ciuill warre, in which Fury and Auarice haue their sudden conflicts, and present rewards. So that whatsoeuer our Sicilian gods had lent vs for the terrour of strangers, is weakened by intestine euils. Neither may you thinke, that these are the first beginnings of their inraged minds, who being brought vp in military discipline, will afterwards send forth this heate conceiu'd amongst themselues more forceably against a forraigne enemy. Would to God, these were at least the comforts of ciuill madnesse. But lest you may beleeue in this matter, that their first practice is to worth and warre; obserue, how often these violent flashes haue a greater shew of lightnes and fury, than of true endeuours in the Fields. These troupes meete in their Castles and fit Townes. They rob the weake Citizens, or vnprepared Countrey-men; and most commonly, this is the greatest matter of their valour. They seldome come to a pitcht Field: their dangers are little or suddaine, for they are obnoxiously pacified, and before the fortune of the day be tryed, you send them away rewarded for their villany. But grant these warres should continue, that these ciuill broyles should increase; but in the meane time, the Soldier is fatted with the richest spoyles of the Country, and being more dainty in warre then in peace, with the goods of the miserable Citizens, is trayned rather in robbery, than in a constant profession, valour, and Art. So that put them in a forraigne Countrey, to the discipline of a true and sober warre, sometimes not very beneficiall, they are broken with a feeble wearinesse; shewing how far different the practice of a Soldier and a Robber is. In the meane time wee are despised, o King, and if you threaten any thing against your neighbour Kingdomes, they neglect your attempts, trusting not so much in their owne strength, as in our miseries: they beleeue, that they can easily stirre vp some Sicilians , with a small largesse, who may entangle you in a ciuil mutiny. So they deliuer you to bee mastred by those, by whom, vnder your leading, they should haue suffered. Iudge your selfe, whether this faster brings ruine or infamy to a noble Countrey. To conclude, Doe you desire to heare what your Subiects may complaine of? Heretofore, the people had recourse to their. Princes for the appeasing of these troubles, lest ambition should knocke together, and breake the Nobility; lest Factions should deuide a friendly Countrey; and they should feare that from their Countrey-men, which enemies vse to threaten, therfore they bestowed that Honour, Sword, and Throne vpon the King. But if they are yet troubled in the Kingdome, with the calamities of the Common-wealth, what will it auaile them to haue giuen vp their right, or enthralled themselues to any man? Either therefore restore them to their liberty, or settle their domesticke peace, for which they haue left their liberty. better, saith he, argue of a disease, then expell it by physicke, rigour; I shall make my power odious euery way to my selfe, which is to be nourished by the blood of my Nobles. There is a great good disposition in them (saith hee) a noble spirit, and many vertues. What, shall I suppresse or darken these lights? or all? But that were inhumane, and perhaps beyond the Kings reach. Which then? Onely those that are suspected. But it were hard to punish onely suspition. And oftentimes, Rebellion giueth no tracke to suspition. A headstrong violence in actiue spirits, does oftentimes plot and raise these tumults at one time. Shall I make All, my enemies, by my strictnesse? Or shall I liue like a beast in the Desart? Or rather, furnish my Court with new men? The remedy, trust mee, is worse then the disease. I hope, the gods and Fates, after we haue auoyded this sharpe storme, will make our Maiestie to be a curbe to those that haue had experience of our power. At least, Cleobvlvs , giue mee the mildest aduice thou canst. Then said Cleobvlvs , I am at your side, Sir, and will excuse the Nobility in what I may. There be cheerefull and stout spirits among them: and these very things which we now accuse, are tokens of great minds: and if the Lawes can curbe them, it will be profitable for the Common-wealth. Now because you haue suffered them to play the wantons, I lay vpon you, Kings, the blame and enuy of those things they contriue and dare doe. But when vertues and vices are no more esteemed by desert, then by popular opinion, it is no maruell, if custome, the estimation of the offenders, and the successe, hath dignified this fault, which if you desire to suppresse and take away, you must call them backe to the meanenesse of their owne birth. And this you may doe by a true reproachfull name; as by calling it Treason, Conspiracy, Treachery; not as they vse to call it, Haughtinesse of mind, Wisdome, Society, A care of the common good. Then, that such which fall from your Allegiance, at least should be humbled, by being forced to begge pardon: when now (which is a strange custome in a Countrey) you are wont to condemne your selfe, by proclaiming them to be innocent, in your Letters Patents: for, if they were not guilty when they tooke Armes, you were guilty, against whom they raised forces. I am sorie to tell it; Excepting this last war, wherein you are absolute Conquerour; obserue the commotions vnder your selfe and your Father; all are dismist with this Caution; that you should impute to your selfe the Lands wasting, mustering of Souldiers, the other mischiefes of Treason, with too much dissembling and betraying the slauery of your gouernment. That these things were done by your command, for your sake, you haue suffered to stand vpon publike Record. But 'tis hard to suppresse those Stars; for you may neither darken them, nor rule them by vngentle meanes. Let them shine,  o King, as long as they shall remember to what Sun they owe their light, and do not obscure your Sphere. It seemed almost necessary, that some bodies blood shuld wash away this fault. of this remedy: and the vnhappy redresser, Lycogenes , shall for some time fill others thoughts with his memory. But whosoeuer, forgetting those times, shall first play this game, quickly suppresse him, not by slow and leuelled diligence, but by speedy aduice. Take the dispatch of it vpon your selfe, lest the double dealing of your Captaines, should vexe the cause by vnprofitable delay. If you shall dare, and not delay, many beeing awed by the reuerence of your Maiesty, will follow your happy leading. Who will begin to doubt of their duty, if you shall seeme to doubt, whether you may iustly punish those who dare offend? You must then be carefull, lest by a fearefull slacknesse you seeme to forget those times, and aske pardon for the death of Eristhenes . Let your power and your will agree together, that you may haue the credit, and not Fortune. Neither listen to composition, contracts and bargaines with rebellious enemies. Let this be the only salue for this disease, if he submit, if hee lay aside his pride, if hee condemne both himselfe and his cause; let it bee your lenity then to fauour him, vnlesse hee offend more dangerously, and deferre his feigned repentance, vntill necessity force him: But pardon him with this prouiso, that you fine him. If he hold any Prouince of you, take away part of it, and giue it to another. If he hath Castles or strong holds, either of his owne or yours, take one of them, as a pledge of his fidelity. Others will feare to adde spoyle to your Exchequer, who now with a contrary desire, dare demand wealth, power, and offices, for the reward of peace: but take heede that you pardon not such offenders vpon the importunity of their kindred, who haue taken vp Armes for you against them. For there is no so common deceit, as of those Noble-men, who deuide themselues into seuerall Armies, not for affection and true loue, but, as it were, by chance. Brothers, Kinsfolkes, Cousins, some will be on your side, some on the enemies, that they may be secure on both sides, by victory or by fauour. It is requisite,  o King, that you should suspect such most, and if they petition more earnestly for their Allyes, take them almost for enemies. And this is my opinion of the Ring-leaders of factions: But what are they without the power of the Soldiers? These are the virall blood, & the sinews of dition. Neither shall you be slacke in punishing them, whom you haue therefore appointed in time of peace for Garison souldiers or Pretorians: if perhaps they shall follow their Leaders against their King, in time of treachery, let them haue a shamefull pasport, let them leaue their Armes; let no noise of their repentance, or prayers of Noble-men alter your resolution: let them learne, not to honour their Gouernours so much, as to reuerence your selfe in them: because they haue their being with them from you, and depend on you. So the Armes which you shall raise, which you shall traine in peace, shall bee faithfully your owne: neither shall your Nobility despise you, by the confidence of trusted forces. But if any shall follow the faction in a time of defection, which are not bound to you by any obligation of fauour; I will not deny, but that your meekenesse to such may be fitting. Towards such, if you will, you may gaine the credit of gentlenesse; so that they may vnderstand, that you gaue free pardon, and that they did not deserue it. But now we treat of their punishments and forfeitures; but first they must be ouer-mastred; or, which is more gentle, be wonne to you, that they may neither deserue to bee supprest, or punished. There are two things, o King, by which the Noble-men are armed against you, and stirr'd to insurrection. If you can take away this their strength by some deuice, I cannot yet vnderstand whether you shall helpe your selfe most, or them. But I must not now relate these things; for I see the Sardinian King comming towards you.  marriage. The King of Sicilie's Answer. The cunning of the King of Sardinia , to corrupt Selenissa : her fidelity to her Mistris.  though therfore against his will, laying aside his secret discourse, he meeteth the King, and welcoming him merrily, leadeth to the place appointed for the banquet. It was the largest Roome in the Court; and the doore being open, the people were admitted to looke in. In these dayes, it was a custome among the Sicilians , to lye downe at feasts, and to feede on beds. But oftentimes ancient customes seeme by a secret reuerence, to be auspicious, which the Kings publikely performe, and the Priests procure. Vpon that day therefore, Meleander did renew the temperatenesse of his Ancestors, that the Guests should sit at the banquet. He had inuited the chiefe of the Nobility. Argenis her selfe was present, with the chiefe of the Matrones; A great enticement to rage  & hatred for the two aemulous Suiters. choler. Radirobanes , no lounder then he, casts a secret eye, to watch if he did at any time looke vpon Argenis , or were made proud by any grace from her. Both of them dissembling all things with a furious feare, misconstrued themselues to be wronged by euery casuall looke or gesture of The Banquet ended, Radirobanes , impatient of loue and hatred, told The King presently goeth aside with him into a Lobby. Radirobanes begins: If I were to speake to another, most worthy King, I would prepare his mind fit for my wishes, by relating my selfe to be King of Sardinia and Corsica ; that Maiorca and Minorca are mine; that I hold many places in Africa , and some in Liguria ; that my Countries are well peopled and well monyed; that I haue a great and fearefull Nauy in all Seas that come neere vs from the maine Ocean. I could besides shew my Pedigree and Series of Kings, whose Ancestors are reported to be borne of the gods: But with you I will vse other language; I, as a friend, desire to enter with you a more firme league of friendship: Let me, I pray you, ioyne my fortune with yours, or that I may speake more plainely, the name of Father, and giue me a signe of your good will. Whatsoeuer I enioy, is at your seruice: Promise mee your Daughter in marriage. Neither doe I know whether I should more earnestly desire this marriage, that I may haue you for my father-in-law or her for my wife. Hauing thus spoken, he made no mention of the succours he brought, which hee did hope would preuaile most with the old King. You offer, saith he, deare Guest, a condition most worthy not onely to be accepted, but earnestly to be desired: for who would not desire the affinity of Radirobanes and of Sardinia ? for you, most valiant Prince, with a lesse fortune then you haue; and Sardinia , though not blest with so noble a King, might hope for greater matters then you demand: but you know that marriages are pleasing more by the vnion of the minde, then of the body. Mens mindes are free, neyther can be compelled by any condition to will what they are vnwilling: especially the fortune of a Queene, to which my Daughter is borne, doth not beare that captiuity. I haue receiued my Crowne from my Ancestors; and She expects it from me. Let it therefore be in her free choyce, vpon whom she will bestow the fortune of her Sicily . I would not haue you take my words, sweet Guest, as if I would not doe you all that you desire, and especially this your request. But I will not haue you wonder, if I leaue to my Daughter her owne choyce. I promise you, whatsoeuer lyes in my power: Doe you worke with her, that shee may be worthy your loue, for a forced marriage would auayle you nothing. To conclude, imagine that you were my owne Sonne, how much soeuer you loued her, or how highly soeuer esteemed of her; I would not wish her for my Daughter-in-Law, if shee did not desire to haue you her Husband. his Daughters minde to be alienated from this marriage; hauing diued into her affection before, perswading himselfe that Radirobanes came vpon this hope. But he still vrged it, soothed the old man, and said he onely liued, that hee might be called his Sonne-in-Law. In this great heat, he vnderstood not Meleander's words, nor his meaning, giuing hope so awry, that to a wise man, whom loue did not disquiet, he might seeme to haue giuen a sufficient deniall. And now Evrymedes told them both, that it was time to goe to the Playes, which they had set vp suddenly in the Court-yard, onely that the people might haue a time of reioycing for the Kings victory. They therefore set forward to the Theater, in which the Surueyors of the Play had placed many things to be seene, fetched out of the Palace, especially ancient Monuments, and the Statues of ancient Her oes, not onely such to whom the worke-man had giuen Hands and Feet, but also many, which were set there, made before Dedalvs , did shew but their vpper parts, by reason the stone was no further carued. After the Kings were set, presently Argenis entred with Selenissa , and a troupe of Attendants, no lesse punishment to Radirobanes and Actors, nor vpon the ancient wealth of the Sicilian Kings; neyther could they view the Princesse much, for looking vpon each other. And now Argenis did seeme to Radirobanes , to cast her eye vpon Archombrotvs , too often, and too graciously. Which, as hee did most vnhappily beleeue, hee muttered thus to himselfe: It shall not auayle him, that loue is mad. We must vse policy: for if I make away Archombrotvs , the remembrance of his death will make mee the lesse accepted of Argenis . And is not loue a warre? But in war, what Cities their Fortresses doe preserue from the Enemy, Treason doth often lay open. They are to be assaulted with gifts, that are powerfull with all vnawares easie to conceiue those things, which our familiars doe oftentimes, and, as if not on purpose, put in our minde. With this traine, will I know all the secrets which passe betweene them. Then, weighing with himselfe, which of Argenis her seruants he should attempt with gifts, nothing did seeme more difficult, or profitable, then to goe to Selenissa : because that Matron had a settled countenance, which would discourage any that should tempt her to infidelity: but if she were once made, the conquest of Argenis would be easie. He was witty, especially when loue had sharpned his nature. I must be bold, said hee; it will be easie so to speake to the old Woman: that if shee be true, shee may not vnderstand the drift of my gift: but if she will sell her faith, she may vnderstand that her Chapman is come. Whilest he is thus musing, neyther Stage-play, nor the other spectacles could delight him, (for there were of both sorts; although heere were some brought out, who should play at Whorle-bats, the exercise of Erix .) But then the Catanenses came dancing to a Pipe of their Androns institution. But he tooke this for auspicious fortune, that, thinking on his bribe, he perceiued on the Theater the like victory; on which the report had personated Argia , and Eriphile ; the one, with a rich Chaine purchasing a most bloudy treason; the other, for a gift, betraying her Husband. Amongst other things, he did so praise those Verses, wherein Eriphile so much triumphed, hauing receiued the reward of Treason, that presently hee commanded them to be brought to him, and oftentimes would reade them to himselfe:  Now vanish care: enough my watchfull face Is with vaine palenesse chang'd, O gods! your grace You now haue heapt on mee. Possesse I this, This Bracelet as my owne? I haue my wish: Now am I safe, possest of heauenly blisse. With such faire Gemmes, Venvs was wont to decke Her selfe for Mars : such on his wiues white necke The Tyrian Prince admir'd: O splendor rare! O radiant light, then Phoebvs selfe more faire! Why am I mad? Loue, Faith, and Piety Must all be pay'd for this; 'twill be to mee Too deare a Bracelet: for this gift shall I Betray my Husband in the warres to dye? Since entrailes of slaine Beasts, Birds ominous flight, And Phoebvs Oracle it selfe did fright Him from the warres. O gift too bloudy deare, Vnlesse a Widdow, thee I must not weare. 'Twere better farre forsake this curst attyre. My wauering Brest suffers distractions dyre: A floating Ship on the rough Ocean so Is by the fighting Windes tost to and fro. But canst thou then be foolish, and deny Blisse giuen by Fate? Why fear'st thou Augury? Canst thou restore this gift for feare of warre? This is warres price: then Theb's better by farre: To mee a Kingdome: Th'Augur contradicts, And hatefull piety my soule afflicts. What shall I doe? Strange Fate, my heart doth feare What it desires: if thou deserue to weare This sacred Gold, if this bright Gemme befit Thy beauty well, then boldly challenge it As the gods gift. If thee thy Lord doe hate, 'Tis iustice; if hee loue, and wish thy state Should equall heauenly goddesses in blisse, Hee'le thinke his bloud well spent to purchase this.  ended, and all returned againe into the Palace, relateth to Argenis in the Priuy-Chamber, what before he had spoken to her Father. He intreated her, that she would be pleased to take for a gift, the wealth of Sardinia ; and more the Louer spake, not vnbeseeming both their fortunes. Argenis blusht, not onely for modesty, but secret hatred. Yet shee replyed nothing, but what not a Virgin, neyther was that power hers, while her Father liued. In the meane time, she gaue him thankes, that hee so highly esteemed of her Fathers friendship. Radirobanes staying a little with her, passed to the first tryall of his intended treachery: he saluted both the Lords and Ladies throughout the Presence, with youthfull complement, retaining still the Maiesty of a King. At length he meeteth Selenissa as hee wished; and hauing spoken some words of course, he began to prayse her Sonne which liued in Court. Then he demanded, whether she had any more, and how many were liuing, and whatsoeuer was pleasing to a woman, and then, of his owne accord, turning his speech homeward: I perceiue, quoth hee, in you many resemblances of my good mother, and haue beene often troubled with the sweet memory of her being dead, when I looke vpon you, and I will make you know this day, how much the Fates haue imparted to you of her fauour. sonne. His name was Demades , whom after hee had deceiued by the shew of much familiarity; Goe, saith he, and carry to Selenissa this picture of my Mother, not much vnlike her, if it were not for the Scepter and the Crowne, for it was a small picture, not differing from Selenissa in yeeres: resembling an olde Woman, a Queene, and one furrowed with wrinkles, but of curious workemanship; the Iewels cost Radirobanes long since twenty Talents, which made a Case for the Picture, at the end whereof hanged a great Pearle. When Selenissa saw Demades with the gift, shee was strucken with the exceeding lustre of it, that shee doubted whether she might make Argenis priuy to this great happinesse; and feared to be suspected, that shee had prostituted her credit; or lest shee should be commanded to send backe to the giuer, this pledge of more then plaine liberality; if shee should haue troubled the greene and vnprepared minde of the Princesse with this nouelty. Examining these things with her selfe, and as yet doubting, shee asketh her sonne, if there were more present, when Radirobanes deliuered him that to be brought? No, saith he, he called me aside, that no body should be priuy to it. Selenissa therfore replyeth, Keepe it, my Sonne, to thy selfe; thou knowest not what is done; neyther is this sent to mee, as thou thinkest, and shall be more conuenient; onely remember this one thing from mee, that thou keepe it secret. Hauing thus spoken, shee returned to Argenis . As yet, truely shee was trusty to her; but now shee had left to hate Radirobanes : then shee began to consider with her selfe, with what great danger to Argenis and her selfe, Poliarchvs was beloued: for how often had shee stayed the hand of violence would not at one time or other preuent her wholesome counsell? To conclude, euery one must looke to themselues. For what, saith she, hath profitable to mee, after a few dayes that hee came hither, then Poliarchvs vpon a whole yeeres acquaintance with Argenis . What if hee bely his fortunes, erring vnknowne, and a Stranger? yet Sicily did know and kingly desire of marrying Argenis . How great shall my hopes be, if I can make Argenis fauourable to him, when I am already possessed of those rewards, which would be almost sufficient to require mee, if it were done? And to conclude, Poliarchvs is absent, and wee doubtfull whether hee be liuing; and if he returneth, whether shee will openly demand him for her Husband of her Father: or, whether she will secretly deceiue me, by shamefull going away with him. But we cannot let Radirobanes goe but inraged; neyther will Fortune (if this condition be neglected by mee and Argenis ) offer vs the like.  The King reduceth some Townes to his obedience: his care to gaine the loue of the people: he refuseth to receiue the Hyperiphanians : he continueth his discourse with Cleobvlvs .  came to the King from the Cities, and sate in the Church-Porches, holding Boughs couered with Wooll, with suppliant groanes, or silence. Many Cities, and many of the chiefe Citizens, vsed Ibvrranes and Dvnalbivs for their Intercessors; whose fauour was so great with the King, that hee would deny them no reasonable request. Meleander therefore vsing a manly clemency against deiected and offending Subiects, punished their penitency onely with a maiesticke frowne. The Embassadours being brought into the Court by the armed Guard, where the King sate in his State, to the terrour of the poore suppliants: and when they complayned of the Genius of the time, which had mooued the affections of the people to be turbulent, after he had somewhat rebuked them, hee left them in better hope to the Iudges, and going from them, he commanded them to heare from those Noble-men his pleasure. But their punishment was easie: some of them were fined, and such as had beene obstinate, banished. Hauing therefore found more clemency then they expected, they fill their Cities with the loue of their Conquerour. The Hyperiphanij would addresse their Embassage apart, protesting their thankes-giuing, their well-wishes, and new Couenants of fidelity. But there were some of the Kings Councell, which thought it a disparagement to the King: because when the King perceyued, that they ranne vpon this byas: I would know of you, saith hee, whether the Hyperiphanij thinke themselues to bee Sicilians , more or lesse then the other Citizens: for wherein doe their vowes sequester them from the rest? Why doe they not speake to mee in the name of the Prouinces and Cities, but in the behalfe of their parties? but then especially when they desire to bee seene, and to breake out openly in a conceit of their owne strength. But when more and more of the Prouinces returned to their allegiance, the Embassadours of Siracusa being admitted to the Councell-Chamber, with their countenance cast downe, signified that they durst not open their Embassage, vntill they were commanded to speake. wherein was contayned their Citizens requests; and also they said, that it often happened, that the people being troubled with the iniuries of wicked men, did foolishly reuenge their grieuances vpon their King and Country: as some, which being franticke through sicknesse, their griefe vrging them, strike their next man: And, that they cannot excuse their former folly, but they well knew the people were stirred vp by these inconueniences, of which they had sought redresse, and that it would much auayle to their future quiet, to haue these things taken away. the Embassadours to tarry for an answer. Then, the Councell breaking vp, hee went to the King; who, as it happened, considering many things with himselfe of the wisdome of Cleobvlvs , had then truely ghessed, that the Cities would returne to their obedience. And, beeing mindefull of that discourse, which was hindered by the sudden comming of Radirobanes , hee calls vpon him againe for those speeches, (deferring the Petitions of the Siracusans till another time, because hee would better consider of them.) If I remember ( our peace vnstable in Sicily , and put our warre and peace in the power of the Nobility: but the Sardinian King then preuented thy discourse, which now you may more at large relate: What are therefore those two bands, or rather Fates, which doe binde Sicily so subiect to the Nobility? Those very same (replyeth Cleobvlvs ) of which, most discreet Sir, you haue often complayned: First, the great number of strong Holds, Castles, and Garrisons in Sicily : then, the custome of appoynting Rulers of Prouinces, so absolute, that they shall hold their places during their life. Truely, if so many Castles were not dammageous, but onely vnprofitable, yet I could aduise you to demolish them. Now, seeing charge, danger, and often hurt goes to the keeping of them, why, being obstinately bent to our owne harme, doe wee any longer keepe them? or against what enemies doe we thinke them powerfull, against Strangers, or against our owne borne Subiects? But Strangers are batt'd out well enough by those which wee haue built in the Ports, and Hauens of our Kingdome. I doe not question the profit of these, we haue strength sufficient in them, and defence abundant from our Enemies: who, if they should breake in vpon vs, thorow those barricadoes, they may be receiued by our Armies, and our Cities, opposing them on euery side, which are many, and not so weake that they may be taken vpon the first assault of our Enemies; they will suffice against any forreine power. But whom should wee feare at home? the people and our Citizens? and not rather the ambition of the Nobility, alwayes bound with a restlesse disposition, for the dangers of fresh and bold plots? There is seldome a will in the people to rise against their King: that madnesse of theirs with which they did so much swell, is almost beyond example: but that, as you haue made tryall, could not be preuented, nor so much restrayned, by the assurance of so many Castles, of which wee now dispute: that you may hereby vnderstand (O King) that these Forts doe not assure to you, those Townes which are vnder them, but doe make them slaues to the Captaines of the Garrisons, who doe oftner force the Citizens against their will to oppose their Princes, then win Rebels and Traytors to their Kings obedience. So that as often as they desire the trust or rule of a Castle, this should seeme to be their priuate meaning: Deliuer to mee, O King, fetters, with which I may binde the Towne which is next to my Castle: that I may haue the Citizens my Captiues: although you should gaine-say, and that they were vnwilling, they shall be at my command. The Prouinces round about tremble vnder these fortifications: Heere armed Souldiers may be taken in, or set forth. To conclude, giue mee a litte Kingdome vnder your greater. You will say, you will disarme the libertie of so great power, by the choyce of most approued faithfull men. You should then doe, what no King of Sicily before could: For what eyther ciuill warre hath there beene, or forreine, in which many Gouernours of those Castles haue not forsaken their Prince? Or what commotion almost is there in our Countrey, but breaketh out of these places, or is receyued into them? Neyther doe they dissemble it, who after factions come to agreement with you. They desire Forts as pledges of their safety; indeed that they may be secure, whether you will or no: and when any occasion shall renew the warre, they may with a secure boldnesse arme themselues against you. Not content with your promise for pardon of their former reuolt, they demand to themselues Forces, Castles, and Souldiers, and compell you for a pledge of their peninitency, (which is often counterfeit) to giue that trust to their words, which they deny to yours. But if these Fortifications bee taken away out of the Countrey, they shall place their chiefe guard, Sir, as well in your faith, as their owne, and shall finde obedience in the Townes trusted to them, onely as long as you will: neyther shall that security of Rebellion, pleasing them by reason of so many Bulwarkes, and Fortifications, inuite them to rayse Armes. But the discipline of our Ancestors, you say, is not to bee condemned, by whom eyther these Castles were built, or afterwards raised by their example. Let not, Sir, that age too much glory, our Ancestors did prouide for their state, according to the Genius of those Ages, and wee, according to the difference of times in which we liue, may sometimes finde safety in falling from their opinions: So that, as I should think it pride, altogether to neglect their ancient wisdome; so it is an absurd kinde of reuerence, that wee should perpetually addict our selues to their old Ordinances. And I doe thinke they built these Castles with mature aduice, which now are offensiue to vs, and wee may throw them downe with no lesse policy: for heretofore Sicily was not all vnder one King; or else euery Prouince had a Prince, who onely by some small Tribute, or little Homage, acknowledged subiection. No maruell then, if each of them made seuerall fortifications; by which they might repell their Neighbours, or if the King should offer them violence, they might not be expelled their Countrey. Now, the gods haue established all things to you by warre, by inheritance, and by agreement, with that happinesse that you can see no body, to whom the common name of Sicily is not more deare, then the narrow bounds of that Prouince wherein hee was borne. Why then doe wee keepe the memory of ancient bounds, and limits in Castles, the vse of them now beeing taken away? Be not mooued with the names of places, whether the Builders or Antiquitie it selfe hath ennobled them. Let ambition fall, with all that might support it. Let but a few of all those Castles stand, and those in necessary places; especially one at Siracusa , not so strong that it may rule so great a people, but sometimes hinder their commotion. These shall be enough to serue your gouernement: but vpon this condition, that they be not committed to the greatest Nobility. Let your Lieutenants be of this kind, neither poore, nor proud of too much wealth, that they may hope for much from your bounty, and not be able to be their owne caruers. Leaue to those Kings this custome of hauing many Castles, who oppresse diuided Nations, by a strange, therefore hated gouernement: which neyther grow together in manners, neither obserue faith by a sound league of friendship; and, which when they looke backe into the History of their Ancestors, blush to be added to a forreine gouernement, and to a Ruler which is not onely absent, but to the Country, wherein the Ruler doth liue to serue. But your Sicily is an intyre Countrey; one Stocke, they haue one and the same Lawes, a faithfull communion of glory, Prince, and fame: although the goodnesse of your Ancestors, onely haue not diuided her againe into different opinions, by giuing vnto seuerall Countries a continuate and perpetuall Gouernour, vnder whom they might remember, they themselues had as it were a King. And this is the second thing with which I warned you, that your peace was troubled, and your Nobles prepared against you. This custome, I say, of disposing Prouinces for so long and settled a gouernement, who, as soone as they receiue a Gouernour from you, they presently honour him, and think him to be their Gouernour, as much as you to be their King: Besides, he rules them more immediately, and is a neerer obiect of their affections, and more immediately punishes the good and bad: especially the Race of the Nobility, doe so cleaue to these Gouernours of Prouinces, gayned by hope, familiarity, and courteous carriage, that oftentimes they will expresse their promised loue, euen against the King himselfe. But, Sir, if you would bestow these places but for some few yeeres, their strength could not so easily grow together: neyther would the Citizens loue or feare beyond measure, those who were shortly to leaue their gouernement. It is long since (saith the King) that I haue considered all these things: but with what face may I take from them those Prouinces, to whom heretofore I gaue them iustly, and according to the ancient custome? What would well deseruing Captaines thinke of mee? and what would these, to whom I am indebted for my conquest? Shall I take away my gifts from them, now well approued, which I gaue them as yet vntryed, and doubtfull? An easie reason (answereth Cleobvlvs .) Doe not disquiet the patience of your Nobility with so great a nouelty. Let them keepe your gifts freely, as they were giuen: but as euery one doth leaue it, make a Successor vpon new conditions. Let their gouernement be limited for 3. yeeres at most; neyther giue them hope by proroging their dignity, that their names are rather changed then their rule. Sicily will not feare Magistrates of short continuance, and ambition wil greedily desire honours, though of momentary durance. So shall you diuide your liberality amongst moe; and your Prouinces often falling void, you may preferre many, according to the state of the times, and their owne desert. If you can take from the Nobility the power and will of reuolting by this cunning, they shall be much indebted to you: for, they shall bee deliuered from dangers, which might oppresse them vnder a seuere and perfidious King. And the torrent of noble dispositions shall be reduced to its proper channell, from these errours, into actions no lesse valiant and martiall, but much more iust, and not opposite to any kinde of honesty and vertue. Marke from the opposite shore a large Countrey, and that oftentimes has opposed Sicily . That Land once swell'd with a proud company of Castles, and Forts, and the Nobility were so great in faction and strength, that they would make their Kings afraid; which most commonly is an vnhappy kinde of power. What troubles did shee indure? our Sicily hath not suffered greater: sometimes the King, sometimes the Nobility were forc'd to stoope, vntill all their Castles were ouerthrown but one: the strength of their Nobility was also supprest by the variable deuices of the times. Some dyed in warre, some in prison, and others, the Heads-man offered as sacrifices to the publike peace. The gods grant better, then that the bloud of our Nobility should be so cheape. This you may preuent, if you will make them quiet, and your selfe a King indeed: for so, that custome of conspiracy and reuolting shall goe out of vse, and true modesty shall seeme burdensome to none, where all obey alike. But so long as any Rebell shall goe vnpunished, the rest will make a scorne of your enforced clemency, that you may vnderstand, how all must eyther be restrayned by the like Law, or none will continue in their allegiance. But if euer againe they shall thinke vpon new insurrections, now aduise with your selfe, what you should doe to them. Take vpon your selfe, I say, the full power; neyther expect in your friends that faithfull freedome, which now out of danger we vse. Perhaps I also could haue counselled you more fauourably, but that, ignorant of what will happen, I know not what they are, against whom I haue spoken. Those wise men also, whose helpe you vse in perillous businesse, doe not enter so farre vpon publike affaires, as that they will neglect their priuate safety. When therefore the Nobility are asked counsell against rebellious and armed Traitours, fearing their displeasure, they often pronounce fauourable iudgement, and almost disgracefull to your dignity and Crowne; lest if they should giue a seuere sentence, they themselues, against whom they did pronounce it, (afterwards, as the custome is) reconciled at the Court, and regaining your fauour, reserue a reuengefull memory, and satiate themselues with the ruine of the innocent. This feare hath lost many of our Senators their liberty, and some of those that are trusty, but when 'tis safe to bee so, and more for themselues then you. I would not speake this before my fellow Councellours, nor to your selfe at all, vnlesse amongst your manifold princely endowments of Nature, I knew your rare silence, almost as safe as forgetfulnesse it selfe.  her Loue; and first telleth him of Lycogenes , how hee was like to surprize her; with the manner of it.  gift being more familiar, he much desireth to meete with Selenissa . And that day, Fortune was a friend to his wishes. Hee had sent some to know in the Garden, and some few of her Maids with her; but Selenissa had stayed behind in her Chamber, being busied, I know not with what Letters;  & hauing gained this opportunity to speake with so magnificent a Giuer, (for that shee earnestly desired) she willed that word should be carried backe to presently returne from the Garden, if hee would come. And now doubling her cunning, she sendeth one of her most trusty Maids with this message to shee would not speake, she should make haste from the Garden to the lower shady Groue, and deceiue her vnwelcome Guest, by tarrying there. In the meane time she her selfe entertained him, as he was entring Argenis Chamber; excusing, that her Lady was absent, and as she said, would presently returne. And when they were priuate, because his Followers stood apart from him for his greater state; then the old woman thus began: I am glad ( o King) that I haue now opportunity to check your great liberality: you haue resembled mee to your deare Mother, much better then Nature hath framed mee. The King replyes; Count these but small things, and pledges of a greater fortune; and that you should not be ignorant of both our states, I can receiue greater gifts from you, then I can giue you: You are my light, and in place of my true Mother, and you may procure mee that, which is dearer then my life: neither doe I expect any helpe from you, but what you shall thinke most profitable to your selfe and your Princesse. For why should she be taken with the loue of Archombrotvs ? What a shame is it to the State of Sicily , that a Stranger, and a priuate man should ayme at such hopes? I thinke it is done by sorcery; and if I were Brother or Father to the Lady, I would search out the truth by torments, and would free her of these vaine cares, either by his death or banishment. Suffer mee to call you Mother. And I pray, mother, both helpe your Nurce-child taking ill courses, and seate me in heauen, that is , teach her to suffer me to loue her. What fault doth she find either in my birth, or in my state? I haue giuen her proofe what the powers of Sardinia & Corsica can doe. Neither do I loue vnder such an auerse Planet, that I should be at all vnworthy of my Royall honour. Doth shee expect a god, or imagine a deity in Archombrotvs , that shee so much scorneth Kings? Neither shall you be charitable towards me and her, without your reward. If I be receiued into her fauour, I freely promise to passe the Admiralty of the Sardinian & Sicilian Seas (which is an honour next vnto Kings) vpon your sonne. If you desire more, know, that you shall euer be in the place of my mother. The burden of so great hope which was offered, did trouble the old woman, already faultring with the gift she had receiued: she was blind, and now did see nothing but Radirobanes . Would to god, said shee, I had not heard this from your mouth. From henceforward you shall haue mee lesse carefull: for in what I did most labour to doe good for you and Argenis , now I feare left I should seeme to be tempted to by vile and base bribery. But there is a deeper wound in Argenis then you suspect. What do you speake to mee of spoken, casting vp her eyes with an abated countenance, she smiled a little. Hee was earnest to enquire, and to presse her, beeing now almost a direct hireling. But Selenissa tells him, it could not be related in so short a time. And, quoth she, the very beginning of my relation cannot passe, without many changes in both our countenances, and heere your Nobles haue an eye vpon our gestures. It will be more fitting to goe downe into the Garden, as if wee went to meete Argenis : I will leade you through a by-way, into the walkes, where I imagine shee is not. Radirobanes , confounded with the expectation of so important a businesse as the Matrone did seeme to labour with, and holding her by the hand, inuited her, who was before willing, to goe to the greene Garden-plot, making his followers beleeue that he went to and scarce knowne to Argenis ; I am deceiued, Selenissa , quoth hee, but wee shall haue my Lady heere presently; this way will be fitter to come backe by. Radirobanes therefore commanding his Followers to stay there for him, he himselfe with the old woman, turned into a narrow way, set on both sides with trees. But then Selenissa began to speake faintly, and, as it were, to want words in the contention of her contrary thoughts; whether she were afraid in earnest, in the very instant of her faith breaking, or whether she laboured to make the courtesie of Treason the more acceptable to Radirobanes , by the greatnes of her counterfeit trouble: and hee wondring at it, she thus began to speake; Why should I not feare, who doe first leaue to speake that this day, which Argenis would not haue me? But so great a matter is it to cure her gainst her will, you onely,  o King, most bee the Æ sculapius for her disease. But haue a care, that the discouery of this secret, beneficiall to you both, bee not my ruine. Then pausing somewhat, she thus began: The gods, o King, giue you a Sonne, left Sardinia be troubled with the same calamity which hath falne vpon Sicily : For because the King Meleander onely had a Daughter, Lycogenes was bold to raise this Tempest, which now you haue calmed. Doe not maruell that I begin from so farre an originall: from thence is the full course of the businesse to be repeated, which you desire to heare. promised to himselfe the marriage of Argenis . And Meleander scorning the alliance with a Subiect, and an inferiour, he being powerfull in friends and kindred, determined to vse violence. This was told the King. But such was the state of Sicily , or, that I may say more truely, so great was the Kings delay in his fearefull old age, that he had rather deliuer her from rape, than surprize the Traitour. There is a Castle seated on a little hill, twenty miles from Syracusa , the seate of our ancient Kings, of great strength: The Hill is vnapproachable towards the Sea-side, which washeth his left side with continuall waues: The Riuer Alabus doth incompasse about the right side, when hee is neere falling into the Sea: the height of the walls and Towers giue it great security. The King inclosing there his Argenis , with onely twenty Maids, and Matrons to attend her, vnder the colour of Religion, concealed the reason of this his purpose; affirming, that in his dreames he had beene admonished of a great plague that would fall vpon them, except import as much. But which of the people, in such times, did not know the occasion of this great superstition? To me, which had from her infancy brought vp Argenis , the King did that time commit the custody of her, and a generall Proclamation was published, making it high treason for any man to set foot within the Castle, excepting the King only. Then if any of our maids or women should go forth of the Castle without my leaue, being put in a Boat without victuall or guide, they were thrust from the shore: only I, who had the chiefe trust, had liberty to goe out in the Ides of each moneth; for there were certaine holy things to bee performed for my family. About the Castle a company of Souldiers pitched their Tents; there were three thousand for the Guard, and did watch by turnes. If you beleeue mee ( o King) this was not altogether an vnpleasing solitarinesse, especially about the beginning, while we settled our minds with that quiet, disturbed before with the troubles of the Citie. The innocent youth of Argenis was delighted with harmelesse iests, which some of the choyce of the maides did make to her. So that I would often commend the happinesse of a free minde; and would condemne with sighes the maliciousnesse of the times, that the Heyre of Sicily could hardly dwell safe in a place for a small time. But I will be briefe with you. Doe not, said hee,  o Mother: for though as yet I doe not vnderstand what these things may concerne mee, yet it delighteth me to heare Meleander's policies, and the manners and fortune of Argenis . Then quoth Selenissa , Thus did wee deuide our howres, that no irksomnesse should put Argenis in mind of her captiuity: She did not much regard her dressing, but delighted in a pleasant Groue, which was within the Castle; there would she tyre her armes strength with an easie Bow, striuing with some of her maidens, who should shoote farthest, and who neerest at the marke. A great applause of the merry company would follow vpon this slight victory. There were rewards also for running, and sometimes would they all striue and wrangle for them. I loued these things in my Nurce-child, with strengthening her in her growth, and keeping her mind from the vnnecessary griefe of her present occasions. After these sports, shee would reade the Chronicles of her Ancestors; neither haue I seene her better pleased, then when such Histories were brought to her. She spent the rest of the day in curious workes, seasoning it by telling and hearing of pleasant tales.  A young Stranger, named Theocrine , presented to Selenissa : hee relateth his misfortunes to her; and desireth her secresie and helpe from the search of Icciobates .  these exercises did shee spend her youth, before cares had banished the harmlesse peace of her mind. But passing from the Castle to Syracusa , being in the Temple of Ivno : I remember the day; me thinkes I am yet standing at the Altar, and offering Incense; the strange chance doth so whet my memory; I say, I was at the Sacrifice, and commending the fortunes of Argenis to the gods, when a Damsell of a most gracefull beauty, entreth the Temple doore: she was tall, and had a most noble garbe; but her countenance cast downe, as betokening sad fortune. I chiefly wondred, that shee had a man in her company: who followed with his head couered, that you could hardly looke vpon him. There was a suddaine muttering of many, that softly enquired, what she was, or from whence she came: for no body knew her face, and her habit was vnlike the Sicilians . She walked alone, but with such Maiestie,  o King, and so well fashioned, and againe with such a shew of griefe, that I had quite forgot my deuotion in looking vpon her. She not much dwelling about the Goddesse, nor offering any gift at the Altar, but stood close by my side, and afterwards falling at my knees, doe what I could: Graue Matrone, quoth shee, this day will giue you more leaue then you doe thinke, to shew your goodnesse. If it please you to pitty, and giue example to the goddesse, whom you so deuoutly worship, leade mee to some secret place, where I may vtter to you the depth of my desires. I lifted her vp thus lamenting, and because I saw, that shee did not desire any lookers on, going presently out of the Temple, I carried her in the same Coach with me to a house of my Sisters, Whither I did then step aside; hauing lodged her, I first enquired from whence she came into Sicily : for she spake Greeke, but so, that you might vnderstand it not to bee her natiue language. I thought her of Campania , and by reason of her neighhour-hood with Greece , to haue had a season of our language. But her beauty presently told mee, she could not be of that Countrey. And, saith shee, that you may vnderstand I doe not falsifie my birth, nor desire helpe that should disaduantage the giuer; behold, Matrone, behold the reliques of my patrimony, if the Fates do not cease to shew their tiranny against my Country, which wil serue me thorow the whole world. And while she was speaking, she draweth out many Iewels out of a boxe, and putting aside her Gowne, you might perceiue her innermost garments, shewing as much wealth as the boxe. They were not the riches of a priuate woman. Running therfore ouer againe with a light view, her forhead, and other tokens of her towardnesse and disposition, I was much amazed, and requested her to tell what shee was. I am a miserable Damsell, saith she, and my best helpe will be, to be the least knowne. But that you should not count mee a wanderer, or brought hither by chance, behold the Letters of a woman, I must confesse, vnknowne to you, yet a Noble personage, and who, through the great opinion shee had of your worth, whom onely she dares trust, deserueth your best assistance. Shee is my Mother, and withall deliuers mee a Letter, which heere (o King) you see: for yesterday I tooke it out of a priuate Cabbonet, that I might reade it before you. Now heare what is written.  you know mee not, and how I know you; you must consider, it is the greatest reward of vertue, that shee doth not suffer her Louers to be vnknowne. You had not beene selected by the King of Sicily , to haue had the education of his Daughter, if hee could haue found one more worthy. I could heare the report of your name in countries vnknowne (which you call barbarous) and deserue not to be knowne by you, by reason of the vnworthinesse of my selfe and my Countrey. But yet pitty mee, although I am a Forrainer; for I am a Woman, and vnhappy; and if this may preuaile with you, my originall is from Greece . Receiue this deare Pledge; receiue my onely Daughter; and if you will beleeue mee, borne of Noble blood. Shee her selfe can better relate vnto you my hard fortunes, which force mee to this course; which shall account her selfe happy in the midst of miseries, if you will not onely keepe her, but instruct her also in your fashions. Farewell.  Hauing read the Letters, I desired to heare whatsoeuer her Mother had giuen in charge to mee. Then saith shee, my Countrey is in France , where the Riuer Rhone deliuereth himselfe out of the great Lake: my name is Theocrine : my Father was not onely renowned among his people, but also Prince of his Countrey, which was not very great: he was called Trevta Commilcondorvs : hee dying, left mee, indeed, of full age, but a Sonne scant out of swaddling clouts: and vpon his death-bed, hee entreated his Brother, (who was called must goe, by the bands of Nature, and the memory of one Father, that he would haue a care of vs; that he would not forsake my infant Brother, nor my tender age, nor especially my widdow Mother. And whilest hee was swearing in the midst of counterfet teares, my Father dyed. We seemed happy in so louing and trusty an Vncle; he had such a care of our Patrimonies and of vs, and did so much comfort my poore Mother. But the end of his care was diuelish, that none of our inheritance should be wasted, to whom he was vndoubted heyre, if my brother and I were made away. Hee assayed therefore to poyson vs: (a villany yet vnknowne to the French :) but it did not take effect as it should haue done: for it had beene better that I had dyed, and beene burnt by the hot poyson, than thou, my most sweet brother, whom would the gods had preserued by my death, to haue beene a reuenger of false treachery, and to haue restored his Fathers name by a happy issue. The deadly act was committed to the last poyson'd Iuncates, towards the end of the Feast; which my brother tooke greedily, by my Vncles earnest perswasion or forcing. I had a sudden feare came ouer mee; whether it was the care of my good Angell, or whether I did suspect my Vncles earnestnesse in perswading my brother to eate that meate, which wee are carefull to keepe children from. Then I returned to my mother; and when my brother fell sicke a little before night, I told her fearefully what I did suspect. She beeing iealous of this before, which the feare of the present danger did now aggrauate, washes her son with her warme teares, almost dead with the violence of the malady, which seized sometimes one part of his body, sometimes another, vntill the vnhappy child gaue vp the ghost in the middest of the Physicians. O villany! Hee that gaue the poyson, had the face to behold the dying pangs of his Nephew, and could put on a face of sorrow: and that the body should not grow discoloured by the poyson, hee cryed out, that he would haue it presently interr'd; and gaue this reason, lest my mother should be ouer-much grieued, by hauing the dead body still in her sight. Neither did shee contradict it, though now assured of his villany: but she was willing not to be able to perceiue it, lest my Vncle being more shamelesse vpon the discouery of this murder, should with more boldnesse attempt the same vpon mee. And now the dead body anointed and wrapt in a Cassocke, was carried toward the doores, and the women began to make a dolefull out-cry, when my mother led me alone into a priuate Roome; and with her haire about her eares, My miserable Girle, said shee, thou makest mee, that I know not what I should most grieue or wayle, either that my Sonne, whom the flame doth now consume his tender yeeres, which knew not their home-bred Traitour; or rather thee, whom the same villaine may snatch from my bosome, with the like, or, may be, worse cruelty. Thy Brother is gone already the way of all flesh; thou art left heere to suffer worse: No skill can recall him; you, by my care, may escape danger. Let vs therefore, my Daughter, ioyne our heads, and aduise together, before the cruelty of our enemies doe ouertake vs. But while we were now mourning, Praxetas , a most faithfull man, came in, sonne to my Vncle, not Icciobates , but another that was dead, and a mother of vnequall ranke. He, in this troublesome feare, bade vs deferre our teares, and while we might, seeke how to escape. Ah, worthy Sir, answered my Mother, rather counsell vs, being amazed in this extremity. If you will let me speake, saith hee, what I thinke, you cannot, Theocrine , be safe, if you take not the benefit of flight. Your danger will be speedy, neither perhaps will you liue two dayes, nor can you be safe any where neere heereabouts: the subtill murderer will finish by bribes, poyson, or treachery, what he hath begun. While therefore your Brothers Funerals are in hand, (for as you know, they are prepared this night) doe you wander about in the darke, as though you were toucht with madnesse, and withdrawing your selfe from the company, come to the backe doore of my house: I will meete you there without light, and in the meane time, keepe you secretly, vntill we can better resolue what to doe. And you, Alc aea , cunningly counterfeit, that your daughter is lost: the death of your sonne, and her danger, will giue you occasion enough of teares. My Mother commanded mee to obey his counsell; neither did I delay the plot; but being seene often about my Brothers hearse, I slipt out of the company of the mourners, and trusting to the shelter of the night, came to Praxetas house. He hid me in the most secret place of all his house: and my mother (as I heare since) acted her part, enquiring euery where, for me her daughter, but there where she knew I was; intreating also Icciobates . that he would send some about the next Townes to enquire for me, and bring me backe to her againe: That she did feare lest I had made my selfe away vpon the griefe of my brothers death. Neither did he omit the search of me; for it did much concerne him to know whether I were certainely dead. But when he had made search for some time in vaine, and my Mother had appointed an empty Hearse for mee, as if I had beene dead, then she agreed with Praxetas , to remoue mee out of the power of the Tyrant; while she herselfe might choose some young Nobleman thereabouts, who being of equall birth, might marry me, and challenge mine inheritance: And she thought she could not send me more safe, then thither where there had beene no former acquaintance or friendship: for so we might deceiue all my Vncles cunning in seeking after mee. And you, graue Matrone, did please my Mother before all others. So she did desire earnestly, that I might liue vnder you, and that you would receiue her only daughter, if in no other fashion, yet at least as your Seruant. Hauing thus determined of our busines, that our deuice might be more secure, she goeth to Icciobates , and desireth to aske counsell of the gods, what was become of me; and she thought none would answere more truely, then Apollo the god of Delphos , whom the religion of our Ancestors most bound vs to: (for wee were a Colony of Greece , and were brought hither into the inward part of France , from Mar seilles .) If it pleased applauded her deuice; for he earnestly desired to vnderstand by the help of the gods, where I was, or how I died, not knowing what was become of me. Neither did he suspect Praxetas . He deliuered besides offerings to be carried to the gods, and bound Praxetas by great gifts, that he should discouer the Oracle to none, before he himselfe haue the full relation of it. But hee not breaking his trust with vs, carrieth mee in a little Ship, which by the Riuer was happely carried toward the Sea, as if he would sayle to Delphos . From thence getting a ship of Durazzo , which from the mouth of Rhone was sayling homeward, when he was assured that all the passengers and mariners were strangers, taking out my night-geare, he called me Sister, and placed mee in the Ship.  into the Castle, and kept by Argenis ; with their deliuerance from the treason of Lycogenes .  trust, behold me,  o Selenissa , no more mindfull of my freedome, but rather a debtor to Icciobates , for driuing mee out of my Countrey, if you will suffer me to bee your seruant. That Praxetas is my cousin germane, begotten of a Concubine: hee it is that followeth me in a seruants habit, that he may more securely counterfeit. Worthy Dame, you may heare from him in more ample discourse, our trauels, and what else I haue briefly related to you. When she had ended her discourse, so sweet a modesty followed her speech, so properly and meekely lamenting, that I found my selfe to bee changed into griefe with her. And I, by the faith of the gods (saith Radirobanes , interrupting her in her speech) long since expected what you did with her. If shee had come to mee, not content to haue hidden her in a fearefull deuotion, I would haue pluckt Icciobates from his prey, which perhaps he now searcheth for, and offered him bound to the Virgin, a slaine sacrifice. she; for neither could so great a Suppliant, be neglected, who by the carriage of her countenance, and the richnesse of her Iewels, could not be thought but to speake truth. And againe Argenis hindred that courtesie, to whom I was bound,  & to whom I might not bring any, but her accustomed Seruants. Then said I, My Damsel, thou mightst haue gone to others, whose charity might haue bin more beneficiall to thee, but none who could more condole thy hard fortune. But I cannot grant thee what thou dost desire; for I liue in a close Castle with the Kings Daughter: my Sister shall be my Deputy in my good will towards thee; who, I promise thee faithfully, shall haue as great a care of thee, as if thou wert her owne daughter. Shee seemed dismayed, and blushing, cast her eyes vpon the ground. But how well (saith she) might I be concealed in that close Castle, if by your leaue I might there serue the Kings Daughter? Her so vnworthy misery strooke me to the heart. I therefore bade her hope the best, and deliuered her with her Praxetas to my Sister. In the meane season I related all to the King, who was at Syracusa . Then Radirobanes interrupted her again: But what was Meleander's will? Did he make haste to comfort her; or rather did hee command any body else to this charitable office? I haue beene long troubled, that you haue beene so slow in your helpe to the poore Damsell. And truely, I did suppose that you would haue prepared a way to giue an end to my cares; and you thrust me vpon new ones. But I count it not much, a little to forget my owne sicknesse, while I heare the fortune of miserable Theocrine : neither would I wish you to passe it ouer too hastily. Then said Selenissa : But that you should not thinke that I did fall in this discourse in vaine, you may know at length, how these belong to you. trouble, then but now you did. And what, saith hee, O Selenissa , if I goe to see her? Doe not (I say) great King; your courtesie may betray the suppliant Damsell: for which of the chiefest Nobles, or at least of the Matrons, would not afterwards goe to visit her? And in that great resort, that secresie may be reuealed, which shee so much desireth amongst vs. If you will suffer her to be brought into the Castle to Argenis , you may there see her more conueniently. I will (saith hee) my Selenissa : Be it your care that shee be well vsed; and if the gods set mee at quiet from my troubles, I will make her Vncle dearely repent the wrong done to her. But now thou pleaseth mee (saith Radirobanes ) now thou art worthy Meleander . At which words, Selenissa being more merry, said, Take heed that you continue this good opinion of Theocrine : for shee will want this day your courtesie: but it is much more easie to be pittifull without danger, then when there must be a present helping-hand, besides the verball and speculatiue pitty. Now therefore giue me leaue to relate the rest. After she was suffered to come to Argenis , I returned merrily to my Sister, and related the kindnesse of Meleander , how hee had granted all that wee desired: and now, Theocrine (said I) thou art my second charge. I am commanded to obserue thee with the same duety as I doe Argenis . But she earnestly intreated, that there might be no greater respect had to her, then to the rest which did liue in Argenis her traine: for in that ranke she should not be published to report. It seemed long to mee, that I did not leade her presently to the Castle, being assured, that Argenis would delight in the company of this rare Damsell, sent vs as it were from the gods. But the yeerely sacrifice of my Family was approaching, which could not well be performed without my presence. Now, the next day after the sacrifice, we sent Praxetas towards Delphos : For (said shee) Icciobates may come to the knowledge of somewhat, if I should neglect to performe my intended vowes. But after I haue beene at the Oracle, I will returne to Syracusa , to your Sister, that wee may deuise amongst our selues what I shall tell the Tyrant in stead of the Oracle of Apollo . After hee was gone, I carryed Theocrine in my Coach, neyther was I satisfied with the pleasantnesse of her discourse, for our iourney being ended, in this communication wee came to the Castle, before I did imagine that wee were come out of Syracusa . As soone as Argenis saw the Damsell, she was struck with some amazement, curiously viewing both with her eyes and mind all her lineaments. I, before the rest, spake modestly of Theocrine , that she was a strange Damsell, who going for Africa , was brought to vs by a shipwracke. Afterwards, in priuate, I told all to Argenis ; who, commanding euery one to depart, excepting my selfe, said: Deare Guest, if you will giue mee leaue to call you Sweet Sister, if you count mee worthy that name, I will not thinke my selfe hereafter my Fathers onely Daughter. Would to God you would giue my Maides leaue, to serue you according to your worth; but from hence you shall know, what power you haue with vs, that you should make your owne choyce, in what degree and ranke you will be serued; and what you would not haue knowne, I, and Selenissa will conceale. speaking: O fortunate Theocrine , (said hee) freely to be beloued of Riuall! You speake too soone, replyeth Selenissa , before you haue seene their true affections and intyre loue, without any insuing breach. Yet you are deceyued, if you thinke there were no iealousie. I loued Theocrine exceedingly, and it was a contention betweene Argenis and me, who should loue her best: our affection was increased by her modesty: neyther was there any one in the castle, whom she did not win by some courtesie. The difference also of her language varying from the Greeke accent, increased her grace of speech, together with the beauty of her dimples; shee delighted in what shee perceiued Argenis did: yet such was her wisdome, that most commonly shee would leaue her the conquest: and that shee might want no part of her delightfull craft, with a feigned anger shee would increase the Conquerours triumph. But altogether ignorant shee was to vse the Needle, or Distaffe; in their Countrey, she said, they were giuen to hunting who were of Noble birth: yet she had easily left that delight with her Countrey: Shee desired them to shew her their skill, diligently obseruing what they taught her: yet I did admire nothing more then her facete acutenesse of wit: her iests were alwayes without offence, and her speech to the purpose: She was well seene in Poetry, which was somewhat more masculine  & strong then those which doe ordinarily play vpon the Lute; & when she set hand to the Pen, to write either Greeke or Italian, she made no such faults in writing, as she did in speaking. Thus did wee recreate our mindes, when Licogenes hindered our peace by most mischieuous Treason: hee, impatient of the meanes by which the King preserued his Daughter, conspired both their deaths. It had beene a most difficult, and perhaps impossible act, if it had carryed an honest ground; but wickednesse is witty to effect her owne will. He tryeth therefore two remorslesse Villaines, who had promised to stop at nothing, and had already giuen their word to execute this villany. To these, hee sheweth the Castle; now, if they were stout men, there did lye the rich booty for them: as soone as the King should goe aside to visit his Daughter, by night they might get within the walls without danger; because no Guards, no friends, nor seruants were admitted within the doores, how easie was it to take suddainely a naked man, an old man, and also layd asleepe? But how they should also surprize of the Kings life, as Fortune had shewed in so great and troublesome businesse) the strangenesse of the fact stirred vp these Ruffians to make themselues notorious by some execrable deed. But who (say they) shall receiue vs into the Castle? or, who will not note vs going out, in so well stored and vigilant a Guard of Watch-men, that they obserue almost euery Bird that flies ouer them? After long disputation, that part was thought the most commodious, which was compassed by the Sea; for the King had neglected to place a Guard there, as trusting to the naturall strength of the place: That it was easie to bring to the shore a little Boat, which the wauing of the water would conceale: but then againe they imagined, that no Ladder would be able to reach the wonderfull height of the steepe Hill. But faith one of the Villaines (who afterwards confessed the manner of the plot) Leaue that to mee. I will finde a meanes to get into the Castle. But one is not sufficient to helpe mee: for, what if the King be to be looked after in the vast house? or, if feare of death should make him oppose vs? and how should wee preuent Argenis her escape, if hauing notice of the danger, shee should hide her selfe, or rayse the Watch lying at the Gates? no lesse then eight would be enough; if you your selfe had rather chuse them, let vs haue them speedily: but if you will trust vs in this so weighty businesse, wee know them which shall effect it according to your wishes. Lycogenes openly promising to trust himselfe and his fortunes in their hands: To morrow, said hee, the game will come into your nets; for now I heare, Meleander is going to Argenis . Make haste while the resolution is hot; and suffer not their consciences, whom wee will secretly bring to you, by too-much delay to be changed from the Treason. I will be at my house at the Sea-side, which is but fiue miles from the Castle, thither bring your prey.  Chamber. The valiant acts of Theocrine .  intended purpose: for, Meleander commeth to the Castle,  & the night being darke, ouer-spred with clouds, without Moone-light or Starre-light, at the end of the Moneth, had fore-stalled the vse of their eyes and eares. The Kings vse was, when hee would goe to his Daughter, to send away his Nobles at the Castle-gate, that they should returne to the next Tents, or into the next Towne for more conueniency of lodging: and wee prouided for the King all things necessary. This was a time of rest to the King, as if hee had left cares at the doore, and layde aside his Maiesty: hee was most free amongst vs in peacefull quietnesse. In that night which was appoynted for the Treason, the King not onely ignorant of the danger, but also more iocund then vsuall, when wee had all supped, began to question in what sports the Damsels passed the wet and moyst winter dayes. And I said, In tales, Sir, which they exceedingly loue. Nay (said hee) you must not giue them leaue to spend their time in Fables, Selenissa , who thy selfe dost begin to be an old Woman, and a Fable. But I will haue all of them relate, what particular mirth they brought to the company. When wee did all laugh, and hee commanded, they which stood next by him were bold to tell their Riddles; which while they were telling, the King by little and little fell asleepe, and lying downe vpon the Bed, on which hee supped, hee began to snort; and because, if one waked, hee would hardly fall asleep againe, we left him without any noyse, hauing couered him with clothes, and taken away the light. And now the Maides, gone to their priuate Chambers, were falne asleepe: But as yet I talked with Argenis and Theocrine , (for Theocrine and I, lay in Argenis her Chamber;) when we heard a great noyse, more then was vsuall, and the voyces and foot-steps of some comming hastily towards vs: neyther did I suspect any thing more at the first, then the ruffling of the Maides, more freely sporting and playing together. But by and by, the danger approaching, I perceyued it to be the voyce of men, vnusuall there to my eares. While I doubt, while surprized with feare, my speech fayleth mee: they beate at the doores with strong blowes. Wonder not if I stand astonisht at the memory of that night: the great terrour of the sight almost put mee beside my selfe. O horrible villany! I see armed men rush within the doores with their Swords drawne, and Argenis and I cryed out aloud, which was all that wee could doe. But Theocrine (heare a truth worthy to be recorded to posterity;) our Theocrine , I say, cast her selfe from her Bed, and aduanced her selfe against the Villaines with no lesse fury, then if shee had beene inspired by some god. And while they stand amazed at the vnexpected boldnesse of the Damsell, being doubtfull what she would doe, or what she was able, Theocrine , assayling the first that entred the Chamber, not onely hindereth him to presse forward, or ward his blow, but flyeth vpon his Sword, and suddenly wresteth it from him. With the same agility, O King (for sooner then I can speake it, shee had gotten weapons from her enemies) shee caught a Buckler from the slaue in her left hand. I looked about with astonishment, not so much at the strangenesse of the danger, as the nouelty of the succour; when shee with her Sword so cut the hinder part of one of their necks, that the bloud out of the wounded body sprinkled on mee and Argenis . Then valiantly shee layes at one of them with her Buckler, another with her Sword, and the third with her hilts. But then the Ruffians, who, troubled at the first strangenesse of the combate, had made a stand, come now fiercely on, as to a danger that deserued their best strength, being not ashamed to fight against one Woman. The strokes of their weapons made a noyse in the close roome, and the hideous out-cryes of women (for now they were all come to vs) made the fearefull resemblance of a Towne besieged, and taken with a greater hurly-burly, then in so small a place and number could be imagined.  The discourse betweene Selenissa and Radirobanes , broken off by the comming of Argenis . The Princesse knoweth that Selenissa betrayeth her trust, and dissembleth the comming of Poliarchvs into Sicily . The returne of Gelanorvs from Africa . The resolution of Poliarchvs , to free himselfe from a quartane Ague by extraordinary meanes.  could not temper himselfe, while he was yet relating it: but behold, their discourse: by chance shee returned by that path of the Garden, which shee was not accustomed to doe: and, in her sight, Radirobanes and Sunne-rising, they would meet in the same place, as if they went to walke. Neyther was Argenis glad at the sight of Radirobanes : for she made haste to speake to Selenissa onely, being now more ioyfull, then when she came out of her Chamber: but when hee came to meet her, she vsed him courteously. The Lady now, by reason of other delights, hating him lesse then before, and, that she might couer her disposition ful fraught with merry thoughts, turn'd to pleasant talk, and shewed a paper full of Verses brought to her a little before by a Noble Poet: wherein he had highly commended the happinesse of the Kings Groue, in which Argenis did vse to rest, for heat at noon-tide, or walke for recreation in faire euenings. She her selfe held it spred in her hand, and so deliuered it to Selenissa , that she might in a manner inuite Radirobanes to the reading of those Lines.  Thrice happy Wood, whom many Sunnes shall cheere, And euery Tree, whose lofty spreading heere Bestowes coole shades vpon these princely Groues; The Wood with murmur of Chaonian Doues Fill'd, yeelds to thee, Ide , where the gods haue dwelt, Nisa , and Pindus , that ne'r hatchet felt. Who can this small Woods wealth in fitting Verse, His situation, gods, and Nymphs rehearse? The Poplar-Tree, neere that, the Alder white, The Ash, the Plane-Tree, the wilde Ash, whose hight Threatens the Starres, Oakes by no Thunder mou'd, Old Beeches, and the Elme by Bacchvs lou'd, Delight with seuerall leaues, they greet our eyes Not all alike, nor from like stalkes arise. The lofty Cypresse his proud top displayes, The melting Rozzen, and Apollo's Bayes; The slender Filbert too; a Fount diuine Waters this Groue, clothing the ground beneath With Flowers produc'd by Zephire's fauouring breath. With such, fayre Proserpine now neere her rape In Ennae's Field had fill'd her Virgin lap. These Woods, no howling Wolues, no foaming Bore Are troubled with, nor Lyons dreadfull roare: When hee has doom'd the absent Lambes to death, And all about him feare his angry breath. But harmelesse Goats, and peacefull Herds of Deere You may behold i' th shades lye sleeping there: Or at each noyse taking short fearefull flight, Whom through the Woods each blast of winde affrights. You Birds, diuining by your notes, or flight, Feare not on lime-twigs in this Groue to light: Nor neere these Fountaines need you feare to meet With treacherous Sprindges to insnare your feet: You safely may in this Ayre take your flight, And on these Trees or Ground may safely light. Here, in the night, may Philomel expresse Her kindreds iarres, and Tereus wickednesse. Here, when the nights, now old, grow pale to see The rosie Mornes, what swarmes may you descry Of painted Queristers to greet the dayes, And fill the Ayre with their melodious Layes? This is not all; the Wood-nymphs exercise Here all their troupes: be hence all wicked eyes. Doe not infect this sacred Wood: but why Is this so grac'd? Why here so frequently Dwell all the Nymphs? You Nymphs your selues detect Our Kings faire Daughter: her chaste steps directs Oft to this Groue, leading her Virgin-traine: Nature did this for their delight ordaine. Therefore these Woods with Nymphs resorted be, T'encrease her Traine, and beare her company. O princely Maide, the care of Sicily , And all her gods, their longings satisfie, This Groue with thy fayre presence dignifie. The ground shall keepe thy feetes impression still, And the South-windes the same with Flowers shall fill. Whose forme the Nymphs shall graue in Barkes of Trees, But not this Groue alone: all Sicily Reioyce in thee; thou mak'st the gods our friends. If thou but walke on Libia's scorched sands, Or, there where frozen nature dyes for cold, Where Charles his thirsty Teeme their station hold. The Ayre will change: each Field shall Flowers possesse; And thou the day with better Fate shall blesse. almost night, left her, and went to Meleander : But then (quoth you alone, and I cannot thinke that you take any pleasure in the tedious company of that troublesome Sutor: but why did hee dwell so long with you? Here Selenissa began to speake gently, and otherwise then Argenis did expect: That she knew not: hee was a man of so much courtesie, and ingenious discourse, that his sweet talke had power to ioyne the day and night; but that now and then hee would complaine himselfe to be made most miserable by loue. Quicke-witted Argenis did not very well approue her prayses of a man she hated: but inquires of her more diligently, What doth he meane to doe? or, when will he depart for his owne Countrey? Leaue off these hopes, saith the old Woman, he will not goe away, except he be forced by the Sword: for he loueth you most intirely, and that fire in him will not be quenched, but by much bloud. But, would to God Poliarchvs were here; would we were secured by his prowesse: yet truely I should feare the reproach of ingratitude, if we should haue any difference with him, by whose helpe wee are settled in safety. But what if we should flatter his madnesse with some small hope, being deceiued by delay, he may be sent backe into Sardinia , vpon hope of being recalled, when things are come to better maturity? I speake not this for him, but for the Kings sake and your owne. It would grieue you, that Sicily , hauing so lately quenched ciuill combustions, should with your wedding-Torch againe be set on fire. Her owne wit, and the industry of loue, did quickly perswade Argenis that mildely reiected this mention of Radirobanes his loue: because shee was about a greater worke, to turne vpside-downe by another guile, that old Woman, that Hagge, of a most pestilent wit. When therefore she had bin a little while silent: I am much (said she) grieued, Selenissa , that the deseruing King should dwel vpon those hopes which he cannot enioy: but we shall see hereafter, what will become of them. The Matron being glad, as if the gods began to fauour her deceit, left the Princesse alone, who afterwards leaning on the Window, and resting her Chin vpon her hand, began bitterly to grieue, that the partaker of all her secrets, had deserued to be suspected by her: for, to whom now should shee impart her griefe? who could now be made Iudge of her sorrowes or pleasures? Then, as it were smiling, shee imagined that the gods were neuer altogether fauourable, or altogether angry: that shee had tasted enough of Fortune: that she would suffer what calamity should happen hereafter: that she would count this for a gift of the gods, that she had not presently told Selenissa , as she was accustomed, what had now hapned to her, and what shee intended to doe. But the matter was thus: Arsidas told her, as shee was walking in the Groue, that Poliarchvs was in the Towne, and was concealed in he would be brought to the Court, by the Posterne-gate. The princely Damsell therefore hasting to disclose to Selenissa that ioy which alone she was not able to containe, came backe more suddenly: but when she began to speake to her, she feared that the old Woman was reuolted to Radirobanes ,  & said nothing of Poliarchvs his comming, whom youthfull affection had forced once more to a dangerously secret visitation. For, when Gelanorvs had returned into Africa , and found not hee found him there as yet sicke of a Feauer. Deliuering therefore Argenis her Letters and commands, he also related the estate of miserable Sicily , and in what danger the Lady was vnder Lycogenes his almost assured victory: neyther omitted he any thing in his relation, but what Argenis had forbade him, which was the hard opinion of Meleander . But hee spake freely of Archombrotvs : I know not (quoth he) with what arrogance should be forgetfull of his former friendships. Yet nothing is sharper- sighted then iealous loue . Poliarchvs presently began to suspect, that affection from him as a Corriual: For, what doth hinder him (quoth he) but by some means he may find, that I loue Argenis ? We doe nothing, other mans valour to saue my Argenis , whilest I sit idlely here? or, shall I let her owe her safety to another mans Sword? Gelanorvs vnderstood this his Masters minde with a grieued heart: for hee feared Meleanders hatred to Poliarchvs , and that Argenis was barr'd from giuing him aduertizement. To conclude, hee kept his faith so with both, that speaking nothing of Meleanders displeasure, yet forthwith hee aduised, that it was most dangerous for Poliarchvs to offer his necke to the fury of Fortune, amongst so many Enemies, and in the vnruly time of warre: that it was better to fayle into his Countrey, and raysing forces, returne to Sicily , without any maske to his greatnesse. I will doe it, replyes Poliarchvs : and thou knowest, that the way to my Countrey lyeth fast by Sicily : But shall I passe that Land, and not salute Argenis ? Shee her selfe would say, that I was ashamed of the dangers past, except I would aduenture into new. As soone as I shall come to shore, beleeue me, some wel-framed lye shall happely bring me to her. Now (quoth Gelanorvs ) I shall neuer liue to see you safe returne againe, vnlesse you grant mee this one request: As soone as you shall arriue in Sicily , that you will trust your safety to none but Arsidas , vntill you haue spoken with Argenis : Then I leaue you to what counsell it shall please you best to take. counsell: but his body did not second the strength of his minde, being violently seyzed with a quartane Ague: which the greatnesse and care of his fresh intendments did so increase, that the night following, though hee shak't lesse, yet hee had a longer hot Fit then before: neyther was the force of the malady altogether vnwelcome to Gelanorvs , because it did deferre more certaine danger. But Poliarchvs , impatient of his physicke, which would take away the strength of his disease, by abating the strength of his body, by fasting, and calling to minde their examples, whom hee had heard to haue driuen from them Agues by excessiue drinking of wine, hee determined to try the same kind of cure. It is no maruell, saith hee, if the Ague goe away, as the Physicians rules weaken, and kill men. I had rather struggle with him, while I haue yet strength, and bee cured after my owne straine. It is doubtfull whether this exploit will kill or cure mee. But it is sufficient it shall not linger with mee long, whatsoeuer the Fates haue determined of me: for such is the state of my businesse, that it is worse to be sicke then to dye. The prayers and teares of Gelanorvs , which was afraid of this dangerous experiment, could not auert his resolution thus settled; no, not the name of Queene Hyanisbe her selfe was a Petitioner in vaine. Leauing him therefore to his will, when, after the third day, the Ague kept his constant course, going to the Chimney corner, he entertained the shaking of his cold limbes with a draught of old wine; which dispersed his heate more violent in his wel- tempred veynes, which were not accustomed to that kind of liquor. The Physicians denyed (as they said) to bee present with one that would seeke his owne death. But Poliarchvs smilingly replyed, that if they were absent, yet Bacchvs would be his Physician, (as the Pithean Priest did often call him.) And he continued, by drinking wine in abundance, to struggle against the strength of his ague, vntill his blood beeing throughly heated, another kind of warmth, then that his Ague brought, began to settle his ioynts. Then, when he had a long time sweat, he was carefully rubbed cleane; and now hee did seeme much more strong. A wonder to bee told; when once more he had prepared himselfe against his disease, with this wrestling, his youth, happy courage, and Fortune, which doth often prosper the vncertaine aduice of Physicians, draue away his tedious malady.  receiued. He sendeth Gelanorvs to Eipercte : And Arsidas his comming to see him.  experiment of his cure, so, after shee had found him in health, shee gaue full scope to her ioy, vntill her power of mirth was suppressed by another sadnesse: for she could not beare patiently Poliarchvs his departure, especially, when as yet did rest in his face the tokens of his hardly-remoued sicknesse: For hee, after some few dayes spent, for the confirmation of his health, did most constantly prepare for his departure. And the Queene, (as she loued him like a Mother) accompanying his departure out of the Court with teares, and all sweet wishes; intreated onely this of him, that he would promise to touch vpon her Coast, if any chance should driue him vpon those neighbouring shores. But after that he entred the Ship hyred by Gelanorvs , and launcht into the maine, he ceased not to sollicit and stirre vp the Mariners; appointing them a time, in which if they could shew him the Sicilian shore, hee would double their wages. The hope of a little gaine was a remedy for their idlenesse; and vpon the discrying the Iland, Poliarchvs willingly acknowledged the debt. Then began he to tremble at the contemplation of diuers things; What gladnesse or what griefe that Countrey could yeeld him; from thence hee should find life or death: with what danger hee had escaped from thence: what if the same storme should rise againe? Forthwith when he thought vpon Argenis , all dangers, and the terrible frownes of Fortune were cleered with a gladder confidence. It was a little Hauen, and of no note, but for Fisher-mens Cottages, twelue miles from Eipercte ; bringing his ship to the shore, hee there landed, and intended to keepe priuate in a meane Inne, as if he were Sea-sicke, vntill he had sent to Arsidas . But when he had asked of the Inne-keeper with whom he lodged, amongst many questions, Where Meleander kept his Court? As yet, said hee, hee is not gone from Eipercte , since Lycogenes his ouerthrow: hee receiueth the spokesmen for the Townes, which come in flockes to him about their submission there as in a Royall place after his victory. Then Inne-keeper; and hee was punished by a most deserued death, and his head hanged on the top of the Castle a little while. But now it is reported that the King is going to Syracusa , that he may leade the King of Sardinia thorow the chiefe place of note in Sicily . Poliarchvs enquiring how the King of Sardinia came into Sicily ; Knowest thou not then, saith he, that the King of Sardinia relieued Meleander with his Army which hee brought, and that by his valour the peace of Sicily is restored? Poliarchvs held his peace, diuining that all things did not goe well with him, the condition of Sicily beeing changed; hee came after danger, others and strangers had relieued meanes. Leauing therefore his haste, O Gelanorvs , saith he, I pray thee let me know what part of the world this is, that is , whether I may thinke my selfe secure heere after this change of State. As yet hee had his perriwigs, with which heeretofore hee had changed his countenance by Timoclea's cunning. Hee deliuereth one of these to Gelanorvs , with plaine Countrey clothes, and willeth him in the twi-light to goe to Eipercte , and tell Arsidas , that hee stayed at the Sea-side, wearied with variety of Fortune, and expected his doome, good or bad. While Gelanorvs was in his way, some of the next Townes ouertooke him, who were also going to Eipercte ; although he had put on a most neate vizard, yet he auoyded their company, lest any should discerne his guile. But he could not goe aside in the narrow way, and they had first saluted him: with a bold confidence therefore, as a Trauellor and Stranger to Sicily , he enquireth of the last warre, and the manner of the victory. They relate the whole with a kind of ambition, as we vse to commend our State in time of prosperity, amongst Strangers: they did extoll two especially, Radirobanes and But Radirobanes should haue Argenis , for the reward of his friendly helpe and courage: for so the report did fly, and what they did beleeue, they hartily told it to Gelanorvs . Hee turning from them as soone as he could, did cast in his mind, amongst the sighes of his deepe sorrow, whether hee should relate this to his Master. He did feare, that he would faint at the very newes of it. And againe, he did hope, that these miseries beeing not yet in their strength, if they were related in season, by his happy helpe and industry they might be cut downe. But before all things he was to meete with Arsidas ; and now they were in view of Eipercte , when he perceiued a Boy loaden with nets, and leading a couple of Hounds in slips; and he knew him to be one of Arsidas his seruants. And would to God, said hee, I might meete Arsidas vpon this occasion of hunting. But if hee should meete him, yet hee would not come alone; neither will hee easily be spoken with, before others. He did therefore prepare himselfe, if any such thing should happen, he would try his fortune. But behold, he had scant framed his tale, when other Nets, and other Hounds, and not far off, Arsidas came with some of the Noblemen of Sardinia . Strangers, hee likewise hoped they would descry him the lesse, and the more boldly hee goeth to Arsidas ; And I am importunately, quoth hee, come to you: I am a friend from Rhegium , and bring commendations and other things, which your Father-in-law deliuered to me at my departure. Then, putting his head close to his eare, which the other did meete; I am, said hee, Sardinians to goe easily before; and that he desired to stop a little vpon some vrgent businesse. Vnder this maske he spake secretly, but shortly with hot, that hee would leaue them all in the wood, and goe to Poliarchvs : neither did hee stay, but followeth the Sardinians gone softly before, to whom by Meleanders command, hee shewed sport. But Gelanorvs himselfe (as if he would goe to Eipercte ) when Arsidas his company were gone out of sight, turn'd his iourney by wayes which hee very well knew, and returneth to the Inne. But Poliarchvs impatient of delay, while hee was yet entring into the Chamber; What newes, saith hee, bringst thou, Gelanorvs? Arsidas , answers he, will straight be heere: I priuately did speake with him going a hunting, and I thinke, according to my houre, he will be here presently. Gelanorvs told him no more, because he had rather Arsidas should bee the messenger of sad newes, then himselfe: But he had an vnquiet countenance, and could hardly refraine from sighes. At length, when Poliarchvs vrged, and began to threaten; he related what he had heard by the way, That Argenis was promised to Radirobanes. Poliarchvs grieued not, nor was angry, but stood amazed at the vnpleasant newes: his troubles were greater then those passions for which wee find names: and now no longer sorrowfull, or as one on whom Fortune had no further power, he resolueth in his Riual's death himselfe to perish; when Arsidas entreth the Cottage, and deluded the Inne-keeper, as if he had followed his game, and had happened thither by the losse and ignorance of his way. But after they were priuate, and that he viewed What doe I see, Noble Young-man? said hee: Or how can you grieue so much, as long as Argenis is in safety? But Poliarchvs answered, I am well, I liue.  Eipercte , and lodgeth at Nicopompvs house. Arsidas giueth notice to  more truely, declared that Meleander's and Argenis intentions were contrary to what Radirobanes did wish, and the people report. So by degrees Poliarchvs was taught to know his mistake; and being restored to hope, began to heare willingly Arsidas discoursing of the state of Sicily . But Arsidas perswaded him without dissembling to goe to the King; hee recounted the ouerthrow of the Enemies; Timonides his Embassage to him; and, besides the goodwill of Meleander , the care of Argenis , and the great good affection of his ancient friends. What should hee feare in so great a guard? Or why should hee rather cloake himselfe, than (being a souldier) trust to his approoued valour? But Gelanorvs opposed this, telling his Master of his promise which hee made to him in Africa , that he would speake with none before he had beene with Arsidas and Argenis . And Poliarchvs himselfe denyed, that he could shew himselfe in publike with the safety of his honour: That hee would sayle first into his owne Countrey to prouide apparell, before he would haue Meleander to see him: That it was onely with Argenis , by Arsidas helpe, he hid desire to talke. But by no meanes, replyed Arsidas , must you haue any suspicious opinion of Nicopompvs : For why should I praise the faithfull loue of that worthy man? He is frequent in extolling you, and his heart doth faithfully reioyce when you are praised. I now lodge in his house; neither can you abide more safely, then vnder his roofe. Poliarchvs willingly agreed, neither did themselues, about midnight they set forward their iourney, and before Sunrising they come to Eipercte , where beeing receiued by Nicopompvs , they drew teares of ioy from the eyes of their kind Oast. Now as soone as it was forward dayes, Arsidas went to Argenis ; but hee could not find her alone, being busied with her Father, and then with Cleobvlvs , before she (to auoyd Radirobanes ) departed to the Groue: And after shee vnderstood by the relation of Arsidas , that Poliarchvs was come, forgetting all her miseries, and not regarding both their dangers, she leapt for ioy, more than so vncertaine and momentany a happinesse was worth. But howsoeuer, the Euening was long expected by her posting desires, that hee might be brought to the Court without danger. I will bee, quoth Argenis , in that entry which leadeth to the Garden: there shall bee onely Selenissa , which shall open it for you and Poliarchvs . Go, my Arsidas , and come in good time. Now swelling with ioy, she goeth to Selenissa , as to impart her happinesse to the companion of her secrets. But she knew hy her commendations of Radirobanes , that her faith was corrupted: when therefore she had also deceiued her, by putting her in hope that she was reconciled to Radirobanes , she leaned vpon the window which opened into the Garden. There then two most weighty things came into her mind, the comming of Poliarchvs , and the falshood of Selenissa . So, her mind being distracted betweene anger and ioy, she could determine nothing certainely. But it was time to make speede, lest Selenissa should discouer Poliarchvs comming according to his apointment. The old woman could not be sent away that night, vpon any fained occasion; neither could shee deuise better, then to send word to Arsidas by a seruant, That she could not be at leisure to looke vpon those Pictures which shee had commanded him to bring before night: and that Arsidas should come himselfe in the morning to the Palace, but should not bring the workman. Arsidas easily vnderstood, that somewhat had happened, which hindred the conference betweene them, and that she did deuise this of the Pictures, and of the workman, because shee durst not name them. Turning therefore to comfort Poliarchvs , whom this delay somewhat troubled, he brought also Nicopompvs ; they pacified him with variety of discourse, sometimes willingly hearing his owne praises, and then Argenis vertues; or if any iest or misfortune had happened vpon Radirobanes . But the comming of some especiall friends, hindred them from doing this good office. Because that night Dvnalbivs had giuen order to haue a Supper made ready at Nicopompvs his house: Antenor was brought out of his Temple into the Towne, and Hieroleander accompanied him: who entring in at the doore, when Nicopompvs grieued that hee must bee taken from Poliarchvs , and that Arsidas could not stay with so great a Guest, (for That they should goe presently, and should not passe ouer their Supper lightly, lest that Dvnalbivs might imagine some secret to hinder their mirth. Poliarchvs , by Nicopompvs placing, stood in a priuate roome by the dyning Chamber, from whence he might heare their talke at Supper time. While they were at Supper, they had seuerall discourses, but most of ordinary businesse, which the wayters and seruants might well heare. But after the Table was freed, and they left alone, Nicopompvs of purpose spake somewhat of Poliarchvs , that he himselfe, being concealed in the next roome, might truely iudge of his owne report, when they vnwittingly spake of him, whom they thoght to be absent. Dvnalbivs spared not to praise so Noble a yong Gentleman; he records all his good parts: and Antenor with and gentle carriage, and in a merry and youthfull dispisition, that he had a ripe and strong wit, and all other gifts of nature, for which we praise old age. But because Arsidas had found Poliarchvs emulation against against Lycogenes , whose beginning Poliarchvs had made most fortunate, by taking the Kings part; then, by degrees, to Radirobanes and the Sardinians , and began to iest pretty openly of his folly: for he was a King of a most haughty carriage towards his owne people; which gaue occasion for many to note in him a foolish vaine-glory, and adulterate worth.  A discourse of Dvnalbivs of the flattery of Poets, by which they corrupt the minds of Princes. How Argenis and Selenissa dissemble each others ends.  the remembrance of his insulting pride, or dare scorne that Sicily should owe thankes to so vnworthy a helper, Hieroleander smiling, saith; What if you had seene him this morning? being puft vp with some false flattery, hee praised amongst his Sardinians , certaine lines written of himselfe, which the Poet had neuer made, except he had beene possest with some other fury besides Apollo's , or else had knowne him to be starke mad, to whom he writ them. I haue set downe the end of the Poesy; by this, conceiue of the rest.  If thou thy dreadfull Chariot driue to wars, His Thracian Steedes and hand, amazed Mars Condemnes; if thy proud Steede thou mount vpon, Wishing thy Seat; proud in Sardinia now To ride: or if shafts to thy bended Bow Thou fit: Apollo and grieu'd Hercvles Are forc'd to yeeld: Cvpid would doe no lesse, But that he hopes his shafts shall conquer thee. Admires, and tumbling, all his wings lets fall. Yeeld, when most faire hee, sober Lawes sets downe To conquer'd India ; when faire Garlands crowne His vnshorne lockes. But since thy powerfull Fleet Bridles the Seas, and makes the shores to meet, That Neptvne bowes his Scepter to thy reigne; We should possesse the Golden Age againe, Would Iove to thee resigne his thundring Throne, And in all temples thou raigne god alone. All of them smiled at the wicked care of the Poet, hunting for a reward by these Verses. Although Nicopompvs beeing a Poet himselfe, did somewhat extenuate their enuy. Because the liberty of poesie is such, that they may erre beyond the limits of truth, to please the itching eare, and with the more freedome, because when they know that what they faine, is not beleeued, it is a matter rather of an innocent iest, then of a shamelesse lye. And furthermore, our times are such, that all will play the Poets to Kings, by their excessiue praises. Is Radirobanes one alone whom this disguise hath deceiued? And hath not hee himselfe (meaning, by his eyes and nodding, his absent King are borne to this fate, they must leaue some of their feathers in this bird- lime. But Dvnalbivs moued with the loue of the Common-wealth; So, quoth hee, doe you, improuident Citizens, who with base flattery courting euen the vices of your Kings, doe not perceiue, how in so doing, you make both them and your selues most miserable: For with how great an inconuenience to your selues, doe you make them such as are ashamed of nothing, but that vse to praise and admire themselues; as if hereafter you had consecrated all their affections with flattery and prayses? But I think them most worthy of pitty, how happy soeuer they thinke themselues, except they would ouercome these home-bred Treasons, and that they Intended carefully to allow and approue, not those things which others doe praise in them, but they extoll in others: for their dignity hath so blinded some of them, that they know not that, which no man besides themselues is ignorant of; what manners, what delights, what study will purchase fame, pardon, or dislike amongst men? O shamefull act! It is now the rich kind of hunting, to search out the inward thoughts of their Kings, which way they are enclined by nature or desire; and then, without any regard to gods or men, highly to commend what they loue or affect; either that by sympathy of manners and speech, you may please them, or that you may dissolue their bashfulnesse, and they may giue you thankes, that you haue made the way pleasing, leading to vice, and beset with ignominy, which shame did forbid them before to try. Why should wee wonder, that Princes, carried by the violent tide of flattery, whither they did themselues before desire, beleeue those speeches which only they doe heare; especially, no body supporting their downe-fall, to which so great violence doth cast them? For such wise men, whom they employ in their businesse, doe either feare to giue counsell in vaine, or know the physicke to be vnwelcome, though it doth infuse health; they administer no helpe to such wounds; or else they make a difference betweene the blemishes with which the King doth distaine himselfe, from those with which he ouerthroweth the Common-wealth: and contented howsoeuer to cure the common affaires, they restore not to the Prince his sight, whereby he may condemne his owne misery, and the deceit of flatterers. Who, being about them, doe wisely admonish Kings, if they be odious through auarice; if they neglect, by too much loue of hunting, the care of the Common-wealth; or with examples of lust infect their age; or by inconsiderate bestowing of their fauours, make themselues odious to the Commonalty? We labour also to distaine the name of vertues, by these vices; they are called, Prouident care, Custome to labour, Courtship, and Liberality: neither onely those vices, but lighter doe grow ripe by these false inuentions: yea, when they doe any thing wisely, they find such famed and exorbitant praises, that oftentimes (beleeue me, my friends) for shame, which no body else was guilty of, my eyes (ouer-charged) could not endure to see. I perceiued them neither to be ashamed of their lauish deceit; nor the Princes to scorne, thus reproachfully to bee deluded. How much doth this Play differ from a Comedy; when in both places you praise those to their face, whom to your selfe you scornfully laugh at, as vaine and childishly deceiued? that except the gods had giuen a greater Genius to Kings, then that which informeth common people, who amongst a thousand should escape out of these snares; which doe euen please by custome, because they doe inuiron their Cradle in their infancy? Neyther doe they remember, they were layd for them; nor are Kings alone annoyed with these dangers. Many of vs are sicke of Kings diseases in our priuate fortune: wee are Kings to our Suppliants; and againe, hee is a King to vs, who hath that in his power for which wee begge. Wee try this man by flattery; wee kill this man by that vanity. Who loues the weapons that Kings fall by? But as for Radirobanes , from whose credulous pride these complaints had their beginning, he hath deserued by his other leuity, that we should excuse none of his faults: and, O wretched Sicily ! if you condemne your Argenis to the marriage-Bed of This speech so delighted Poliarchvs , that he could hardly gouerne himselfe: and hee desired to imbrace Dvnalbivs for this his diuination of which he might often allure from him instructions of the like vprightnesse: Then, he determined to commend them all to Argenis , and to vse their trust in such things as the present occasion required. The Guests hauing taken leaue, Nicopompvs and Arsidas returne to him, and they leaue him not, hauing brought him to his Chamber, before that hee, carefull of his friends rest, and willing to be left alone to his melancholy cares, counterfeited himselfe sleepy. the vanity of mortality?) in mutuall deceit of the like practiz'd subtilty, by what meanes the one might auoyd the others sight, when the day came: for, without the priuity of Argenis ; and Argenis wished to send away in the shaddow of liberty, voluntarily framed a discourse of Radirobanes : Shee was, shee said, earnestly intreated by him, that shee would be the next day walking in the same Groue of Trees; that hee desired to speake with her about some businesse of great importance, and then to be brought to the speech of Argenis . time to meditate of what I shall answer, when wee talke together, and he is in his wooing. I wish therefore, that you would be with him betime, and that you would hold him in discourse, vntill I, hauing thought what I would say, come downe into the Garden. heart, that Argenis her selfe had appoynted a fit meanes, and time to betray her selfe. But she was ignorant also, that shee her selfe was deceiued, and that she was sent away, not so much to goe to Radirobanes , as to misse of Poliarchvs . It was in the morning, and they preuented the extremity of heat in their walking. And now Radirobanes stayed for the Matron in the Garden, vnder colour of that desire, hardly then more carefull for Argenis then Theocrine : neyther was the old Woman slower, when she had risen sooner out of her Bed then shee was accustomed: I goe (saith shee) to the King of Sardinia , if his loue be so great as hee saith, I thinke hee did not take much rest, before hee came to the place of our meeting. But wee who are worne with yeeres (speaking it smiling) suffer the punishment of that age, which neyther acknowledgeth it our paynes, nor esteemeth anothers. Here Argenis did warne her againe, that shee should not leaue rather speake with Radirobanes there, then in her lodging. These newes were welcome to Selenissa , who beleeued that Argenis desired this short time, as a retreat of her former loue, which must be shaken off, before  of their designes: their finall resolution; with the departure of  make long stay, bringing with him Poliarchvs , vnder his false disguise, with some few Pictures, in the habit of a Merchant. Poliarchvs trembled, and that courage of minde which no dangers, no enemies had danted, fayled him, thinking that hee was to goe to Argenis . And the Princesse also looked pale, in that desire of expecting him; and had noted her words to faulter when shee spake to any. There was a priuate Gallery, in which shee did vse to walke, and take some freedome in her solitary thoughts and cares. After stretcht-out Hand, as if hee had made it his Deity, they both sighed, not without much blushing; and presently taking off his disguise, hee appeared with his true face; and saluted Argenis with the common words of courtesie. But Arsidas , as thinking vpon something else, withdrew himselfe to the wall, giuing them both liberty of free discourse. And now againe their words fayling, through their distempered thoughts, made their amazement fearefull, vntill Argenis , being deliuered by shedding teares, sayd: Doe I see thee, my Deare? or, doe my dreames represent to mee thy fauour, and carry to Argenis some likenesse of ioy you see? But Poliarchvs replyed; Lady, you see one suffering all past miseries now with a fresh feeling, and warned by your sight, how tedious it was to haue beene absent so long: And, but that is irkesome to remember, What feeling had you,  & what strength in my dangers? How much did you grieue? and how often did you condemne my absence? Alas (said shee) you may too well vnderstand by your owne griefe, how many wearisome dayes I haue spent in your absence: and I am the more miserable ( by many dangers: to conclude, that others dare hope, I may alter my affection. Say once more; Art thou the same Poliarchvs ? Art thou returned into Sicily ? Art thou safe? Doe I behold thee present? or, Whether am I not the cause of that leannesse which I see in thee? But must wee make fresh complaints of these miseries? Must thou be banished from mee againe? And must we alwayes loue fearefully? He briefly related all his wandrings; how hee had beene ship wrackt; how hee had vanquished the Pyrats; and how hee was sicke in the Court of Numidia . But Argenis (which was the businesse in question) opened in few words the great affection of Radirobanes ; and that she feared lest Meleander would take him, hauing well deserued, for his Sonne-in-Law. Which deed (saith shee) I will preuent with my owne death, except you hinder it. But what a misery doe you thinke it, still to stand vnder the stroke of death, being no farther from mee; which the Contract with the Sardinians doth most strongly vrge? Besides, I am now alone, I haue none to comfort mee, or to impart my cares to. I feare Radirobanes his power; I am afraid of my Father; and And but now (affirmeth Poliarchvs ) did I search for her with these eyes: for neuer, before this day, did I speake to you in her absence. I, quoth Argenis , If I liue, will make her a most wretched creature. She fauours the King of Sardinia ; neyther doe I know, why or how shee is changed: but that you should not doubt of her mischiefe, when wee were priuate, shee praysed Radirobanes to mee: That had beene nothing, if shee had not perswaded mee to be intreated, that at least I should be affable to him, in a seeming affection; that is , by degrees I should forsake you, with a kinde reciprocall loue to him; and now also I haue suffered her to goe out to him, lest shee should know that you are here with mee: both of them are in dispute about mee in the Garden. But shee shall not offend vnpunished: If I bee euer happy, shee shall dye. trembled at the danger, that Radirobanes was so powerfull in Argenis her houshold; and, if Argenis would leaue it to him, he promised to reuenge the iniury. After this aduising with themselues, with anxious deliberation, what course to take; in this inconstancy of resolution, nothing did please they could think vpon. If Poliarchvs should goe to Meleander , declare himselfe to be a King, reckon vp his courtesies, and desire Argenis for his Wife, and bee the Spouse of Poliarchvs . A right remedy indeed against these miseries,  & of present consequence, if it succeed. But Argenis did feare spake of Radirobanes and his Army, That it were not fit for Poliarchvs on the suddaine, to assume the Stile of a King, nor could he compare with him, whose wealth was already knowne, and who now, at this instant, filled Sicily with his forces; that shee did feare treachery, and villany, which loue, and the desire of a Crowne, might finde out. I feare lest hee be raysed to the hope of your marriage. suspition, her memory now searching thorow all Archombrotvs his actions and words. They let fall therefore that resolution of going openly to the King, as too rash, and most dangerous. They dwelt longer vpon another: That when Fortune denyed them Sicily , they would goe into Poliarchvs his Countrey. Meleander of his owne accord would wish to be friends: and, if Radirobanes being deluded, should attempt any thing, wee could oppose him by force; Selenissa and her Husbands House? In stead of the Maiden Vaile, shee should haue a Sayle, which should couer her as she went; and, in the night, the Starres, more then fiue Torches, would giue light to her farewell. strugling and condemning this violence: and her indifferent thoughts betweene going and staying, much distracted her. Now, she considered the cause, which seemed absolute good; then, her credit, which yet she must account tender, not onely with a sincere, but also wise bashfulnesse: yet shee followed the best course, but that she would seeme to deny him nothing. But hee himselfe was not much pleased with this fugitiue course, because he knew it to be a very vsuall remedy, and that there was almost no History of Louers, in which a woman did not flye with her Husband. When besides hee had obserued, how Argenis did enforce her selfe to commend this flight; We are worthy (hee said) O Lady, not to seeke obscurity and silence like Theeues, for the inioying our desires. What if wee be taken, and there be no defence vnder an angry Father? What if we should be deuided, neuer more to see each other? We doe in vaine expect a Guard from equity, except we our selues prepare a Guard first for her. If it please you, and you beleeue that we may yet continue for three moneths amongst our miseries, now growne familiar to vs; I will returne from my Country with power, that I may receiue you, the Hope and Stocke of Kings and Princes, not without Ensignes of Royalty. But, if our Enemies will yet withstand vs, I will wrest from Sicily , by force of armes, both mine owne and thy happinesse. Now promise me faithfully, that thou wilt so long liue. I will be here quickly, except death preuent mee: which, if the Fates shall worke so suddenly, yet this shall be my comfort in it, that you were not there an eye-witnesse of the sight. When he had spoke this, with a sigh, Argenis wept sore; and thinking againe, how farre, and how suddenly hee would goe, shee suffered as much now for loue, as before from bashfulnesse: but, by custome of grieuing, shee more easily suffered three moneths to be prefixed to her misery; so that then shee her selfe would follow, being now vtterly depriued of all other hope. After they had agreed vpon that resolution, both of them counselled and aduised many things: Poliarchvs also demanded, What she would say to Louer by words and teares, and which was more powerfull, by protesting her owne death, if hee deceyued her, that hee would not breake with her in his appoynted time. I haue loued many things in thee, Poliarchvs , quoth shee, but especially your constancy, and which is a rare thing in men, thy modesty. It is long since, that I haue called thee Husband, not disposing my Fathers command, but not asking it. Now againe I endow thee, as farre forth as I can, with my wealth, fortune and loue, and doe sweare by both our liues, that no power shall force mee to falsifie this oath: Argenis shall be Wife to none, if not to Poliarchvs . If the gods grant that wee may once happily knit our Wedlocke knot, as a full and compleat blessing, wee will owe it to the Fates: but if a more disasterous fortune shall crosse our intended purposes, yet I will goe chaste to the graue, and at least there shall be a marriage of our soules. After shee had spoken these words, her face was dyed with a Scarlet blush; and him. Both of them did feare, lest Selenissa by chance should returne from witnesse to so many secrets: but if the old Woman, by her owne falshood, should force her of necessitie to put her away, that then she should remember had made her selfe vnworthy. This commended Timoclea sufficiently to Princesse feared, lest shee had beene faulty, by being too sparing in rewards to her: for Selenissa had caused that shee was not receyued into the Nursery, and had taken away from her many things by disswasion, not onely of loue, but of appoynted gifts. But when Poliarchvs had discoursed to her Dvnalbivs his good-will towards him, and had declared how Antenor and Hieroleander were no lesse his friends, the Princesse reioyced much, that there were men of that worth, whose secure aduice she might vse in her secret affaires. They determined therefore to gratifie them all with some courtesies. Although that hardly any thing could be added to his honour, yet they said that Kings neuer wanted meanes to be thankefull. And it shall be a great step to to my Father. But what rewards shall wee haue for Antenor ? I will send gifts often to Apollo , and his Priest; and if it shall seeme fit to you, shall marry our deare Timoclea , with a large Dowry, which we will settle vpon them. Now the time was spent, and both of them expected a farewell; neyther of them being able to begin that mournefull tune. They therefore were silent in sadnesse; vntill Poliarchvs striuing fiercely to intreat her, and take his leaue, faynted in his very words; yet, that hee might giue an end to his griefes increasing in this instant of parting, with a compulsiue fortitude, saluting Argenis with an humble Congee, hee parted from her, without many words. But the Princesse, often stopping her teares, at last being ouercome, in a sudden passion went out of his sight: frantickly did shee beat her innocent brest, feeling more, or imagining to feele more Poliarchvs his afflictions, then her owne; and being thus confounded, shee rusht into her priuate Chamber, and hee did hardly finde his way out of the doores, with weak steps and eyes. faint, neyther daring to speake a word, returneth to Nicopompvs with this dumbe man, who hardly did know himselfe, and from thence led him, willing to go a ship-board.  him the combate of Theocrine ; with the deliuerance of the King and  affections, Selenissa discoursing of the danger of Theocrine : for, as soone as he imbraced the old Woman; comming into the Garden; How did spent a troublesome night in dreaming of her; for yesterday, if you remember, we left her fighting at ill ods. But that which most troubled me, was, to know how Argenis doth, and how farre do you finde her tractable? The Selenissa answered; You haue pleased the gods by sacrifice, O King, except I should make my selfe eloquent, and should impute to my owne skill, that Argenis did begin to confesse she had bin too vndeseruedly cruell to you: for what should you desire more? I haue made her confesse her fault by my words; and she, with a reconciled affection, hath promised to come hither. But while she is attyring her selfe, let vs go on with what we haue begun; for it doth much concerne you to know Theocrine . She fought, as I told you, and like a Champion proud of the spoyles of her enemies, did brandish her Sword and Target; you would haue thought her to haue beene the Souldier, and the rest brought vp in a Ladies Chamber. Two of the Villaines lying now dead before her, there were as many left: no body was free from wounds; for one of their Swords fell lightly on Theocrines brow, while shee did reach a blow at another: the bloud presently did spring out, and running downe by her faire cheekes, a little dazeled her eyes. Shaking her head and weapons (I tremble yet, O King), when she sharpely threatned them, she seemed to haue diuinity in her. We scant perceiued her to be hurt. But then she cut off that hand with her Sword, which had giuen her the blow; neyther was she long about it. But when the Ruffians, weake through their wounds, turned their backes, she, neyther fearing night nor treachery, followed them out of the Chamber. But while these doe lurke more secure, by the benefit of the night, and her eares: for, the other Rout of Villaines, when they had some-while searched for the Kings Chamber, at length, following the light, which not farre off did burne by the Kings Bed-side, they breake open the doore, and set vpon the King, to binde him, as a Present which they had promised to Lycogenes . The King being awakened by the great noyse, as soone as he perceiued men, (which was counted Treason in that house) and armed too, although he was troubled by sleepinesse, & the strangenesse of the deed, yet snatching his Sword which did hang at his Beds-head, he also made haste to withstand them. But, before he could rayse himselfe vpon his feet, tumbling from his Bed, the Villaines incompassed him, shaking for anger and feare; for they, nothing reuerencing those sacred Members, nor that Name second onely to the gods, cast him backe vpon his Bed to binde him; and, wresting his Sword out of his hand, which he held, one of them was so bold, as if he had beene by chance (but I thinke, he tooke pride and pleasure in his vngodly boldnesse) to strike him in the face with his Hilt. And now the Kings hands were bound, when leading him like a condemned man, with his head couered, they proudly complayned, that their fellowes, which were gone to apprehend Argenis , were not return'd with their prey; whilest Theocrine , proud of her successe,  & heated with fight, and her wound, came to the King, and seeing him bound, assayling the Villaines with a fierce voyce: O you the worst of Parricides (quoth she) you shall feele my Sword, which is yet warme with the bloud of your companions. Alas, you are not worthy of my hand, neither shall you all so dye: some of you shall liue to indure more. Neither did she deale with them more fauourably then she threatned. In this russling, the cloth fell off with which the Rogues had blind-folded Meleander . After which, he perceiued his helper, and saw them, had warned the rest, that Fortune did not fauour their wicked enterprize. You would admire Theocrine ; who hauing so many Swordpoynts held at her, and preuenting so many deaths only with her Target, could not indure to see the King bound. But, O most sacred King (quoth she) how long shall I behold thee captiue? and withall she loosened his bands, which were not knit very fast, and defends him seeking his weapons, by interposing her body, vntill he had found his Sword. Here Radirobanes breaking out, after his tedious silence; O wonder, saith he, hardly to be beleeued! What Age did euer see the like? Fro whence had the Virgin that strength? From whence was the great loue of the Destinies toward the King, that they should suffer him, so neere destruction, to be preserued by a greater miracle of happy deliuerance? O Selenissa ! But is all this true thou affirmest? Pardon my vnbeliefe in midst of so many miracles. Then said the old Woman, I pray God, O King, you may wish mee so happy, and not aliue, you are not in loue, and now speake not to me. Go forward then, replyeth Radirobanes , to fill mee with the wonders of this so notable night. And shee answereth, Meleander , freed from his bands, was not wanting to his owne safety, nor Theocrines danger: by their valour they so brought to passe, that of three remayning, one fell, the other fled; the third, Theocrine tooke hold of, and binding his hands behinde him, deliuered him to Meleander . Keepe this fellow, quoth she, and goe not abroad, O King, till I returne, if you loue your safety. He that is fled, must not escape. And farther, I will diligently search out the depth of this Treason.  with the renowne of her vertue, had vsed this meanes to see her, and to tell her that his name was Poliarchvs ; his secret departure out of the castle: the King maketh search for Theocrine .  Chamber, whither our women in a great affright had flocked together. Collect your spirits, Sir, for what you shall heare from me, O King, except you were most constant, would suddenly turne you into dangerous conceits. Theocrine growing hot in the combate, her eyes now changed, and almost vnknowne to vs through her whole countenance, taketh Argenis by the hand, willing mee also to follow. When we were gone, that none of the rest might heare our speech; I giue the gods, quoth shee, hearty thankes, that they haue forced the violence of my affection into this house, and this change of habit, for no vnprofitable deceit. This guile, Madam, hath saued you and your Father, whom, by the gods assistance, I haue freed from these villaines. It is iust that I should be pardoned for this good successe: for, why should I any longer dissemble my selfe, when as these combats haue proued mee a man? I haue deceiued you; for I loued with greater confidence then you would, and haue beene admitted vnder the protection of a feminine disguise, whereas otherwise I could not. But herein I am to be excused, that liuing so long amongst you, I haue so reserued the manners and shape of a Maid, that no immodesty could disproue my Sexe. But if I would haue beene shamelesse, what I might haue done against Women, I haue now shewed by conquering men. Neyther doe I desire to prayse these forces, or this continency; It shall be sufficient (O Lady) if they shall haue pardon from you; for, I would haue you know, that being not vnequall in birth, nor fortune, for a Kings Daughter, I haue followed your renowne out of a forreine Countrey, and, as it were, by the gods direction, haue counterfeited my selfe a Woman, that I might see you, and inioy your company. The cruelty of my Vncle, and the miseries of my Mother, and all the rest, are but Fictions; and now I goe out more loue-sicke, then when I came in: for how small a part of your vertues did Fame deliuer to mee, and yet was I rauisht with them! attyre? or, what Thetis had instructed him in this cunning? I am vndone. Is it hee whom Argenis loueth? It is hee, answereth the old Woman: and, that you should not thinke this to be a vulgar secret, Meleander is not yet priuy to it. But now hee denyeth to stay any longer, lest his courage, suspected by the King, should by little and little lay open his deceit, that hee will shortly returne to the Court, but in a Souldiers habit, and will come to mee presently, either at Syracusa , or at the Court, as often as I goe from the Castle: that his name is Poliarchvs , neither could hee liue any longer then he pleased Argenis . Waigh then in your owne conceit,  o King, what wee two were; if this discourse should trouble you a man, how doe you thinke women should be affrighted, who did see it? Then he spake somewhat to her in her eare; I doe beleeue, hee disclosed his birth and Countrey, and intreated the Princesse for the gods sake, that shee would keepe it secret: and he found her true; for this is the onely secret, wherewith Argenis would not trust mee. I had alwayes the keeping of the Keyes of the Castle, which he snatching from mee, Goe to Meleander , said hee; I will call the Watch and Guard, lest there should be yet greater concealed Treason. Then was there no Starrelight by reason of the thicke Cloudes; and hauing vnbarr'd the Gates, holding a Torch in his hand, euen at the entrance of the Castle, made an out- cry, that murderers had broken in vpon the King; that the Soldiers should make haste to his succour from their quarters; that the danger was at hand, and euen now present, and the villany almost executed. He himselfe hauing alowd proclaimed this, turned a contrary way in the darke. But they which watched next to the Castle, enraged at this sudden tumult, in what habit soe're they were, runne speedily to shew their faithfull trust: for many of them being halfe naked, lest by apparelling themselues, they should come too late, brought nothing almost but their Weapons; and now they were entred within the Walls, and the Gate-house and Hall swarmed with troupes. And when they searched in vaine for the Enemy with many lights, they began to feare lest some vaine apparition had mocked them; that they were drawne from their standings by some Stratagem: but the chiefe Captaines, and amongst them, in which I was with Argenis : our out-cry, and feare in the Kings countenance, and specially the two dead bodyes that lay at his feet, were signes of no small danger. They came therefore about the King, and because they saw him safe and free from danger, kissing his hand with confused voyces of gratulation, they went about nothing else. Some enquired what were the murderers? others, Who had frustrated their intentions in this weake and womanly house? many of them lighting Torches, searche lest any of them lay concealed. And now they began hastily to question the Prisoner; some pinching his cheekes, others poynting their swords at his brest. Meleander imagining a matter of consequence, not so suddenly to punish him, deliuered him to Evrymedes to be safe kept. And now being secure and in the middle of his Guard, he goeth to Argenis Chamber, where he heard by our relation, the murderers to be vanquisht by more strongly giuen, then needed for their deaths, the Kings friends asked earnestly, What mortall men had beene able to shew such fortitude? But after wee related this notable deed to be done by the hand of a Maid, silently looking vp and downe, (for they could not speake for astonishment) they sought for the Conquerours. The King also commanded her to be called; and because we told him that two of the villaines had escaped, and hee himselfe had called to mind, that one fled out of his Chamber, hee commanded searches to be sent thorow the whole house, which should find and bring them: but whether they had passed by the Port, at which the Guard was receiued in, or whether they had climbed ouer the Walls, it was at last told the King, that they could neither finde them nor Theocrine. Meleander had lesse care for the Theeues, but was impatient of Theocrines absence, and againe appointing some to search for her, the whole house resounded with the name of her call; who, vsing the benefit of the night, was gone perhaps good part of her way. And the first signe I had that Argenis did loue him, was, because she did dissemble, what both of vs knew, so far foorth, that she had almost deceiued mee.  deliuered by the goddesse Pallas : This beliefe confirmed in his owne opinion. Lycogenes discouered to be the Author of the Crimes.  confidence, beeing warned by Posts, what happened to the King, came with their forces; who going out to examine the prisoner, the King thus spake to them that stood about him; Although these murderers haue committed a heynous offence against mee and the gods; and it is fit that guilty persons should be discouered and punished; yet I desire not more to be reuenged, then to see her, by whose help I am preserued. Wheresoeuer Theocrine is, I count my selfe vnhappy, vntill I am assured of her safety. O good gods, let her not fall into the murderers ambushes, by her too much forwardnesse. While he was thus speaking, and complaining, the Scowts bring word againe, that they can heare no newes of her, neither in the Castle, nor in the Field; if any mischance had happened, she would haue beene found, eyther hurt, or (which were more heynous) murdred. The King stood amazed for a time, as wee perceiued by his countenance, being falne into sudden passions: at length turning to the Image of Ivpiter , which stood fast by on the Altar in the Castle; Great god, said hee, if I haue iudged rightly, strengthen my beliefe with thy god-head. It is by the power of heauen, that I haue escaped out of the hands of these wicked murderers. O Theocrine , if it bee yet lawfull to call thee by that name, which thou hast taken vpon thee amongst vs, thou art no mortall Virgin, nor of the common sort of gods. Thou on the most diuine Mother: thou, most valiant of all the gods; Thee I doe adore: Oh suffer not vs Sicilians to be ignorant of thy large fauour; for thou hast redeemed mee from my enemies, bound vnto thee in all the bands of Religion, whether thou followest thy Fathers command, or thy owne sacred pleasure. O my thrice happy and that Pallas did speake to thee, and was with thee! who, that she might the better conceale her diuinity, would wayte on thee like a seruant. If you aske by what reasons I should beleeue this; I first remember her countenance, and the same diuine power that then kept mee from discouering her immortall face, causes me now too late to finde it out. What lustre was there in her eyes? Who so remembers all her lineaments, may know, this as shee feigned her selfe a mortall woman, so she did not conceall altogether her godhead. But who would doubt of the fauour receiued after this conflict, worthy onely of that we should thinke so many men to sinke vnder the hand of a weake Virgin, and should not rather giue thankes to those heauenly armes, which brought the fight to this good end? But she that kept her selfe secret while she was with vs, doth now disclose her selfe by her absence; shee is ascended into heauen, or perhaps, concealed from our sight, stayeth amongst vs, to try if we would proue vngratefull. While Meleander was in this discourse, a great noise arose amongst the hearers. You know, the minds of men, and specially of the multitude, doe easily make the gods the authors of great and vnvsuall euents, and doe grow violently superstitious of them. It was besides a glorious thing for Sicily , that the gods themselues should fight for their Kings. The consent therefore of the soldiers entertained Meleanders speech, calling her by the name of dedicated Temples had giuen her; some, by the superstition of their owne conceits, some, to please the King; and others, louing the liberty of great and generall ioy. How, doe you thinke, Argenis and I did sport with stolne smiles, to heare these false imaginations? But not displeased with this conceited fable, I wondred that the King had made a goddesse so easily. But the iest stayed not heere; A certaine Soldier, moued either with flattery or madnesse; But what was (saith he) that apparition which I did see in the top of the Castle, when we were first raised out of our Tents? A most bright light shined in the darke, which I did thinke had taken hold of the house, and that we had beene called to quench the fire. Then the light began to bee deuided into beames, like the Sunne, and the length thereof growing by degrees, ascended into heauen. But the newes, Sir, of your Maiesties danger, tooke from me then the admiration of it, which now with reuerence I doe recall. But what if it were the shining brightnesse of Pallas ascending vp to heauen, after shee had freed you from danger? The Soldier had scant ended, when many, with the same madnesse, affirmed, that they had seene what hee inuented or dreamed. So this feigned deuice was strengthened by many Authors; and they did eagerly labour to haue Theocrine made a goddesse, by arguments, worship, and a publike consent. But when they congratulated with Argenis , that shee had entertained a goddesse so long in her Castle, shee casting downe her eyes vnder shew of bashfulnesse, preuented her smiles; vntill the King, hauing honored outragiousnesse of the fact. And Argenis and I, to discourse of that it was not his naturall disposition curb'd for a time, but his true vertue, that hee behaued himselfe so modestly with her so many dayes. What was more chaste then his thoughts? Who was so humble amongst women, and so stout amongst men? And now she recounted the benefits, which Meleander in his own opinion did think worthy the greatnesse of the gods, and the strength of Pallas : And now also (but that somewhat bashfully) did she shew, how much hee loued her, daring by a most dangerous disguise, to counterfeit both his Sexe, and runne the hazard of certaine punishments, if he had been taken. I must confesse,  o King, I did relieue the Ladies modesty, by commending those things which I knew to be welcome to her; and because I did not yet know you, I esteemed none better than Poliarchvs . In the meane time, Cleobvlvs had examined of the Prisoner, the Author and meanes of the Treason: he being vnable to endure the Racke, confessed all of where the Sea washeth on the Walls; I know not with what hooke throwne vpon the wall, which presently stucke to the stones, and held firme with a counterpoized weight, the Rope made fast about it, by which they might climbe vp. Heere the wiser sort did thinke the King much to haue ouershot himselfe: for when he should suddenly haue surprized Lycogenes , he had rather send some body to his house, who should fetch a man of his eminence. Whether he did now beleeue, that he was gone out in Armes, that hee could not be easily taken, or whether hee hoped that he would come out of his owne confidence, scorning the danger of a tryall. But hee, with the chiefest of his followers, whom he had gathered together the day before, for the most part ignorant what had happened, vnder the colour of hunting, trauelling farther, came to a strong Castle which hee had, not far from Leontium . From hence hee giueth notice to the King by Letters, how vnsafe it was for him to come to his hearing amongst so many enemies, and that hee ought not to be condemned without his tryall of Law: and also, that murderers suborned to his ouerthrow, should not be credited. In the meane time he increased in power and faction; that wherein the King was blamed for his lenity, it was then thought requisite to dissemble his fault; and writ to him, as if he were innocent of it. the fact, at least, he should not seeme so much to pardon him, as not to giue credit to his accusation. They aduised farther, that the Prisoner which discouered it, should come to his death in the Castle, as it were, by accident. Yet Lycogenes was not vnmindfull what he had deserued, nor or trust one the others power or promises. And by this suspition were hatreds nourished, worse almost then the warres which thereupon ensued.  The King instituteth Sacrifices to the honour of Pallas . Hee consecrateth his Daughter. Poliarchvs commeth to the Court in the habit of a Souldier; and hee and Argenis promise marriage.  which had giuen way to the fury of the Traitours, vpon new aduice, carrieth gratefull to Pallas . There were certaine solemnities in hand for fiue dayes, which wee vsed to make Holidayes, for the Natiuity of that goddesse. They being therefore now neere, the King goeth to the Temple, and calling all the people together, speaketh to this purpose; that they did sufficiently vnderstand what he could say of the great fauours, which the goddesse as a reward, that hee should often acknowledge it. Then he recordeth the Treason against himselfe and Argenis ; yet named he not the Authors of the treachery, nor let fall any reproachfull word against Lycogenes . That her strength and power, preuented their swords bended against him; and the villaines oppressed by the power of her godhead, were there slaine. But what pledge,  o Citizens, shall wee giue to the goddesse, of our thankfull memory for her fauourable helpe, but onely in consecrating to her seruice my deare gods therefore, in the publike assembly of the Sicilians , I, as the holy Priest, doe chuse her to bee Pallas Votaresse. I command her to minister at Pallas Altar, and to haue charge ouer her Temple, vntill by Ivno's fauour she be made a Bride. After the King had ended speaking, Argenis of purpose goeth forward to her Father. The Augures were round about, and the King holding a white garment wrought with all the stories, which shew to the people the greatnesse of But if, quoth hee, you cannot serue the goddesse, except you cast off your Fathers iurisdiction; from henceforth I free you from all my authority; onely marriage shall exempt thee from the seruice of Pallas ; all our Citizens shall obserue thee, performing thy holy Rites vpon euery Fayre day. At these words of Meleander , the superstition of the people powred out teares, prayses, and vowes. Then the whole City accompanying their returne to the Palace, afterwards through euery house, they kept to their new holiday, a drunken Vigill. she not refuse to take from him the Priests ornaments? Did she not free her Fathers conscience from this false deuotion? Or did shee suffer her selfe to bee consecrated to Poliarchvs vnder the name of Pallas ? Then faith the old woman, Truely I was angry, that Fortunes mockery was gone so farre; but I should not haue withstood her affection, without her anger, who did now fauour discourtesie to Meleander , to recall him from his ignorance heerein: For, what matter was it to haue a goddesse for their helper? Farthermore, hee did chuse his Daughter, not onely for deuotions sake, but that the people might bee accustomed to see and admire the Lady, next Heyre to the Crowne. So shee might bee safe by liuing publikely, who had almost suffered vnder a solitary life. Neither were they base Sacrifices, or vnworthy a Princesse, to which shee should set to her hand. Her garment was set with gold and starres, and her head dressed, that you would thinke her rather a goddesse than a Priest. It was sufficient for her to touch the Sacrifices lightly, before they were killed. Then did she offer Incense to Pallas , and afterwards in a guilded Chaire, she receiued the people flocking to kisse the Bough which she held in her hand. habit. Hee alone was with him, who feigned himselfe to be his cousin germane. Then hee called him Gelanorvs , hauing changed his condition and his name, and vsed him as a Seruant. First, hee came to Evrymedes , and presently, by his Noble disposition, and secret Genius of Worth, hee growes intire with him: afterwards, by him hee is admitted to the King. He gaue him to vnderstand, that he came from a far Countrey, and would thinke it one of his greatest happinesse, if he might haue leaue to improue himselfe in the Court of so great a Prince. The King, who had not seene Theocrine often, did so little know him, being now altred in speech and apparell, that he spake to him, as to a Stranger, and newly arriued in Sicily . But he admired his countenance, and all things worthy in this new Guest, made way to the greatnesse of his future acquaintance. Now was the day of the Fayres returned, wherein Argenis must come to the Temple, when both of vs knew Poliarchvs to be in the Court. We therefore trembled; she, through the immoderate sence of ioy; but I was fearefull, lest shee should doe any thing vnworthy her Honour and my education. But the vertue of the two Louers did better dispose of their actions. Pardon ( o King) if I praise Poliarchvs a little in your presence: for truely Argenis had beene vnworthy of your affection, if she had laid her selfe open to base and ignoble loue: neither should you owe mee much, if I did not preferre you before such a Noble Gentleman, whom no body could excell, but your selfe. But then Argenis hauing receiued this message, forgot her ordinary Ceremonies; shee did not see the Princely habit of her Priesthood, wherewith shee was girt; not the company of such as came to doe their deuotion; nor the Virgins and Matrones which were accustomed to attend her. She was altogether bent vpon looking into her disease, gently intreated her, that shee would gather vp her spirits. And shee, neuer deseruing to bee checked so before, bashfully blusht. We therefore goe to the Temple, and now the Sacrifices were by her touched, when earnestly looking vpon Argenis , I perceiued againe, that she was perplexed: and being assured that this was some inchantment, vnder which miserable Louers mutually suffer, I looked about mee, from whence this arrow should be shot. Not farre off I perceiued Poliarchvs : but hee was a man, and did seeme greater; neither did I easily know him to be he had altogether with his attire, so laid aside what-euer before seemed either womanish or timorous: his brow was grauer, his countenance lofty, and his eyes rowling with a modest, but manly freedome; his forehead and temples, with a carelesse neglect, his haire couered. And now I called to minde gracefull gestures, and a minde so changeable to all purposes. And did these hands once spinne? At this sight therefore I pardoned the amazed Argenis ; whom notwithstanding to recall to performe her Rites, (for shee was almost past sence) I made as if her Gowne hung out of order, and seeming to gather it vp againe; You should remember, Lady, said I, that Poliarchvs will not allow that you should forget your selfe heere. You would haue thought shee had wakened at these words. Shee therefore said the prayers, which the chiefe Priest did beginne, and did willingly this honour to Poliarchvs , who was worshipped vnder the name of a goddesse. But hee (O how much better is it for euery man to bee happy in his owne opinion, then in anothers!) did desire to pray to them which worshipped him; euer now and then with a restlesse minde looking on mee and Argenis . Wee returne to the Court. Enquire not then what discourse Argenis and I had. Our speech was altogether of Poliarchvs . At last, quoth Argenis , Wherein shall wee offend, mother, if more holily and religiously wee esteeme of my Fathers preseruer and mine, then such as know him not? O that I might at least but speake with him, and laugh together at the folly of my Priesthood. I will worke meanes, Lady, said I, that you may doe it, hee shall come to you by my helpe. And this I promised the more freely, lest she (for there was scant any hope of her health) should conceale from mee her malady for shamefastnesse, which might haue beene dangerous vnto her; or lest shee should haue done worse, if I had not a little comforted her. When I departed from sought accesse to mee without suspition. I, as if I had gone to my sonne, saluted also the Stranger, and briefly willed him, that hee would come thither againe before night. Why dwell I long on this? Being brought priuately to would haue beleeued him againe to haue beene Theocrine . They had no speech, (for he did often visit her) at which I was not present. No offence, no rashnes was in him, though a young man and a Louer: but that once he was bold to speake to this purpose; That he was borne of Princely parents, and that hee would no longer continue vnder a priuate fashion, than his loue to Spouse, and requested her marriage. First (quoth Radirobanes ) let him sinke as low as hell. O mad boldnes of a womanish fellow! I did not beleeue (saith the old woman) that the Lady had a word left to answere to it. And I prepared my selfe to answere for my charge, when she, after a long silence, as vnprepared, was bold to speake thus: The gods be my witnesse, whom I thinke, Poliarchvs , to bee all fauourable to thee, if thou hadst beene my Brother, I should haue agreed to no marriage, lest the Lawes should shew mee any man, whom I were bound to loue more then thee. Thy valour, and the liberty thou gauest mee by conquering the Theeues, maketh mee, that I cannot demand a greater pledge of thy fidelity. I call the gods therefore to witnesse, and you Selenissa also, that I doe thus far agree to these conditions, that I faithfully promise to marry none, if not Poliarchvs . Neither doe I altogether derogate from my Fathers power ouer mee: if he command me, I will wed none at all, but neuer any other man. Radirobanes waxed pale, and said, there was some inchantment vsed vpon the Lady, and that Poliarchvs was a Sorcerer, speaking many other things which his new rage could inuent against his happy Corriuall. But then, saith Selenissa , almost amazed, yet loth with a bootlesse reproofe to incurre their anger: The gods, said I, fauour noble thoughts; yet you doe runne a bold and rash course. And if I may aske you one question, What difference is there, Poliarchvs , whether you doe this priuately, or open your wishes to Meleander more freely? If, as you said, and I beleeue, you are of no meane condition, when you haue already done a courtesie, and also are beloued of Argenis , what reason is there, why the King should not like this alliance? If you will pardon mee (quoth hee) graue Matrone, that my youthfull violence, with a desire to see Argenis , did draw mee from my Countrey, without attendance, or the tokens of my fortune, I will easily excuse the rest. But vnknowne, and almost alone, how should I defend my cause and fortunes before the King, but I should not liue so long amongst other miseries of loue, if being yet doubtfull of my demands, hee should command mee to bring proofes and euidence of my fortune and honour from my owne Countrey? You haue therefore, Lady called me away from death, which I had intended to effect, if you had shewed your selfe cruell to mee. But I beseech you, Matrone, leaue off your suspition of our Contract; for what my modesty was, being a Louer, it shall continue being a Husband. It is sufficient that I am beloued, and that my hope is settled; my desires in this are at an end. Neither doth a stolne wedding please mee. I am more patient of delay; I will sue to the King by seasonable requests, vntill he himselfe shall command me to marry her in the sight of all Sicily . Thus he said, and equalled his modesty, which he declared in speech, with his manners, and preserued that bashfulnesse, which he brought being a Stranger, vndefiled, after the pledges of their secret loue and affection. Hee liued in the Court, he hyred some seruants, he filled his Stables with horses, which hee did loue to breake, that he might shew himselfe to be rich. And furthermore, he did win the good opinion of most by his faire disposition and louing carriage, and as occasion offered, by feares of Armes. By these meanes he was in no lesse fauour with the King, then you now seee Archombrotvs . Yet Gelanorvs alone was priuy to his secret intentions: the rest of his houshold, as gathered out of the Sicilians , did not know there master. Oftentimes therefore would he goe and visit Argenis without suspition, sometimes alone by himselfe, yet he neuer came to Argenis but by my direction. You would haue said, that a Sister plaid with a Brother vnder me their mother. Me thinks I doe now see him comming to the Sacrifices, which did say, Pallas , and thinke on Poliarchvs ; and from the Image of the Goddesse, as looking by chance, would turne her prayers to Poliarchvs . But hee not ignorant of the iest, did eyther counterfeit Maiesty, or else make signes to her with his head, in her prayers. This did often make vs merry amongst our selues: neyther could I sufficiently rebuke their wickednesse, in making these iests. Radirobanes could not bridle his fury: But if (saith hee) Pallas had beene iust, shee had wrapped this Mimicke Goddesse, who vsurped diuine honours, in many more snares then euer Arachne hung her selfe.  hope. Selenissa chideth Argenis . And Meleander's speech to her, touching marriage.  who, by his Ladies command, told Selenissa , that she should returne, and, if she pleased, bring Radirobanes with her. Go, (saith shee to the man) and tell thy Lady, that we will attend her presently. When the man was gone: O King (saith shee) you are look't for by Argenis : I know not what occasion hath hindred her comming hither to vs: but while we are going to her, suffer mee shortly to declare what remayneth. Briefly therefore shee related, While was sufficiently strengthned by the peoples diuision, Poliarchvs , being able in strength and iudgement, was no lesse hated by the Enemy, then the King himselfe: on whom also hee had taken such vengeance in the first battell, that hee gaue the victory to the King. She declared his misery indured, for killing banished out of Sicily : but was euery day expected of Argenis . It is hee (O King) (lest you should blame Archombrotvs wrongfully) who hitherto hath made the Lady such a Stranger to you. Then said Radirobanes , But thinkest thou (Mother) that I may be secure, so long as hee liueth? What if Argenis shall be changed? What if she shall renew her former vow of ancient loue? This very same thing, that now (as you say) shee loueth mee, hauing forsaken Poliarchvs , is an argument that shee may forsake mee also, if I preuent it not by some meanes. Doubt not (saith the old Woman) after you haue Argenis once to your Wife, nothing shall withdraw her from your loyall loue. I thinke therefore fit that you hasten the marriage: but if it shall chance that Poliarchvs doth returne in the meane time, I will leade him at your command, to be betrayed, when hee suspecteth nothing, and trusteth his life in my hands: for hee must be made away; neyther will it be any difficult businesse to surprize him vnarmed, and all alone. of her aduice, came into Argenis her Gallery; in which she her selfe did walke with a sad countenance, after shee had sent Poliarchvs away, as moued by so late an occasion of sorrow. Yet shee did rise to meet another chayre. But he, proud with the hope which the old Woman had settled in him, commended his vowes and his loue to the Lady, and left nothing which the effect, and force of loue could shew. Argenis being harsh beyond his expectation, answered nothing to his content; and he tooke that the more heauily, the neerer he hoped the disposition of the Lady to haue beene plyable to him. Selenissa also feared, when the King, deceiued in her promise, looked earnestly on her; and also doubting, lest his loue being deluded, he should force his rage into language of open hatred. After that hee departed out of the Gallery, the old Woman was bold to condemne should shee frustrate that hope, which the day before she her selfe gaue? or at least, why should she not haue a care of her Countrey, which of anger, Be not thou (saith she) an vnlucky Prophet: The gods will haue care of Sicily , by whose power the Traytors, as your selfe was witnesse, lately payd for their offence. The old Woman, touched with these doubtfull words, and, not certaine, whether they were directed to her, trembled. The first scourges of her villany did sinke into her guilty conscience: but shee knew, that wickednesse was onely to be maintayned by wickednesse. Being therefore fearefull of her owne estate, shee seriously bethought her selfe, by what meanes shee might incense Radirobanes to take Armes, and shee would deliuer Argenis into his power: to whom, that she might not be suspected, in the meane time she dissembled by little and little, that she had forsaken that Poliarchvs was absent. But, Argenis knowing it to be dissimulation, hated her face the worse, so much differing from her heart. But Radirobanes began now to let loose his vices, howsoeuer hitherto concealed, by so much the more disorderly, by how much the longer they had gathered strength by dissembling; thinking no reward to be sufficient for the ayde hee gaue Meleander , so hee carryed himselfe, as if hee had purchased more then enough, Sicily and Argenis , by his forreine forces. Hee went therefore more boldly to the King, about a Contract with his Daughter, and began to deale somewhat harshly with all the Sicilians ; hee had got the displeasure of the greater sort, especially by his immodest pride. But perplexed thoughts troubled Meleander , fearing lest this loue should end in a quarrell, and that hee now being old, tyred, and vnprepared, should be drawne to a new warre. Hee therefore called his Daughter, and demanded, what thing in Radirobanes had displeased her so much? It is for priuate persons (said shee) to chuse marriages by the fancy of loue, and simpathy of dispositions: wee must cast away that sweetnesse: for it is the fortune of Kings, that sometimes they make the most firme League with men vnworthy, and whom themselues hate: sometimes, cruell necessitie may neglect the bands of all tyes, and the loue of all consanguinitie: hee vseth to be most in our fauour, who feedeth our Greatnesse with most profit; and those are thought to be the fayrest Allyances, which strengthen best a Kingdome. If I had begot more Children, you might beleeue, that in this, I respected not thee, but my selfe: for I know often, that Daughters and Sisters are cast away by Kings, vpon those whom they will deceiue, vnder the colour of friendship, or reconcile for a time; and being afterward nothing mooued by the pledges of their bloud, nor by the reuerence of the titles which they haue giuen one to the other, they esteeme of warre and peace, according to the disposition of times and fortune. But thou, settled vpon thee alone, the loue both of a Father and a King; therefore, eyther aduise thou thy selfe, or suffer mee to admonish thee. It is fit, Sir, replyes Argenis , that a Maide should giue a reason, if she desireth to chuse her owne Husband, not if shee resolue whom to deny, whether it be reason, or whether it be bashfulnesse which may make a Maid to deny all: But perhaps I might not haue hated this Radirobanes , if hee had rather loued mee, then beleeued that I was a duetie owing him: I cannot indure that ill-beseeming pride. You your selfe (my dearest Father) imagine the rest, which you dislike in the man. Those things haue induced mee, that I would not, by this alliance, haue you, Sicily , and my selfe vtterly cast away. The King, seeing her obstinate, let her goe, determining still to be, as hee euer had beene, an indulgent Father.  him beleeue that it was her desire: That hee would vndertake the course enterprise.  not taken effect, yet desired to heare her speake; for hee knew her to be both witty, and now his owne, since shee had reuealed the secrets of her Lady to him. But hee had discouered onely to Vertiganes the confession which hee had gathered from her, and had lessened his rage by many complaints to him, and by many threats, sometimes against Meleander , and sometimes against plot, if I haue recourse so often to Selenissa : thou mayest safely succeed in my turne; When I shall goe to Argenis , thou mayest easily come to the old Woman, and then deliuer her this Letter, in which I complaine, my frustrate hope which shee gaue mee, has made mee a laughing-stocke to perchance she hath any for a businesse of that consequence: for I make thee as Iudge of my actions, as in other businesse, so in this, to be my onely aduizer. Hee, vndertaking the businesse, as soone as Radirobanes visited who stepping aside, when shee had read them, returneth to the Ligurian , knowing well, if this Match did not go forward luckily, that shee must sinke on both sides. And signifie to the King (said shee) that nothing shall be wanting of what I had promised; but such seasons require not a slow Louer: Hee is a King, hath an Army, and a Nauy, and by rape the gods also haue taken to themselues Wiues: loue excuseth rash enterprizes, and the sacred name of Husband blotteth out iniuries: neyther am I cruell against my Nurse-childe, word with Poliarchvs , to whom shee promised neuer willingly to be married to another: Let her therefore keepe that constancy of her vowes and words, lest shee should anger those gods, whom she called to witnesse of plighting her faith to Poliarchvs . But then she still vpbraydeth mee: for why, saith shee, dost thou tell mee that Radirobanes is so in loue with mee? or, if hee loueth, how long will hee sit idly? Tell him besides, that will haue no alliance with Radirobanes , yet layeth the blame of denyall vpon his Daughter: Be not deceyued, your King shall not be long able to shew his valour; for Souldiers are secretly mustered, and when Meleander shall finde himselfe strong enough, hee will neglect him with disdaine, to whom now hee fearefully denyeth this alliance. his Master; who, according to his custome, departed more angry from the Lady: and he as much admiring the newnesse of her aduice, said, Let vs doe it, that may be lawfull for her to loue vs. I will, by Ivpiter , prouide for all things, by all diligent meanes, with what faith soeuer Selenissa speake it: neyther will I be thus despised by Meleander . But lest the old Woman should faile vs, and condemne our indeuours, to which she did so earnestly perswade vs, she shall not know, how we approue of her counsell: and she standing firme to our party, will be glad to be suddenly surprized with her Lady Argenis. Vertiganes durst not disswade him, though he fore-saw danger, and the infamy of violated hospitality: So, by the fraud and treason of Selenissa , there was a deadly rape intended vpon Argenis , and (which was more lamentable) as if she had desired it. It would be aduantagious for their deceit, to make Meleander easie and suspicious of any surprize. Once more therefore Radirobanes began to bridle his anger; he goes to him without a Guard, he feasts with him without weapons, that on the other side he should not doubt to trust the faith of Radirobanes , and sends backe his Army to Sardinia , to preuent suspition of too much power. Yet his Houshold, and Traine of Nobility which he had, and the Guard of his body, were more then six hundred men; besides the Mariners and Oares of fiue Gallies, (for he kept so many for his owne vse) which he had chosen out of all his Nauy. Thinking this a sufficient strength for his cunning Rape, a long time he considered with himselfe, by what meanes, more secure hee might carry away his prey. In the depth of his consideration, this Plot especially affected him: When his Admirall-Gally entred the Hauen of Eipercte , the rash Sterneman split her dangerously against a hidden Rocke: her Ribbes were so bruised, and what soeuer strucke vpon the Rocke, vnder her fore-decke: yet was shee raysed by long Poles, Oares, and Cables quickly fastened to other Ships, and the adioyning Shore: beeing thus freed from danger, shee is stemmed on the next landing, and there put on the stockers: So, being supported on both sides, the Ship-wrights built her as strong as shee was before: Neyther would hee haue her onely repayred, but, which is the fortune of Houses and Townes, to rise more glorious out of their ruines: for the Corinthians , who first built Gallies, transferred the excellent vse of shipping to their Neighbour- Countries: So, from hence, Corcira presently tooke it: And the Syracusanes now are very strong by Sea. Meleander had a beautifull Gally built according to their inuention: by which, Radirobanes commended his Ship- wrights to take a Patterne, and new build his, almost from the keele: Neyther did Radirobanes onely, but Meleander also, often goe to visit this worke. He therefore concluded vpon this course in his treachery: this Gally finished, hee dedicated to Argenis , fastning her Image to the fore-decke, and placing the like in many places, for the more beautifull trimming of the same. the day of naming his new finished Gally. Vpon that day therefore, hee inuited to the Sea-shore, Meleander and his Daughter, because he would make them both a Dinner in his Pauilion, which he had erected on the banke-side: which lasting the best part of the day, the Gally dedicated to the name of all variety of musicke, lanched forth. So, when it was night, wild-fire which should liue vnder water (for in those dayes it was a rare and strange sight) should giue light from the same Shore. But in the midst of this Pageant, vnawares to the Sicilians , and most of them weaponlesse, as not suspecting any danger, he determined to carry away by force Argenis and her Father. And that he might turne their mindes from care and suspition by long iocundnesse, hee intended to celebrate the night before Argenis her Birth- day, with reuelling and masking. Hauing chosen eleuen of his choyce young Nobility to Dance, he masked with them. The argument of this Scene should be the Fable of the three gods, who expelling their Father Satvrne , diuided by Lots the Inheritance of nature: When the Heauens did fall to Ivpiter ; the foamy Seas to Neptvne ; and fierce Plvto was sent downe to the gouernement of a more populous Kingdome.  The discourse of Lawyers, Counsellors, and Aduocates; and the meanes of abridging the tedious delay of Suites.  to grant those requests which the Embassadours of Syracusa , and the rest of the Cities, a little before had demanded, in this glorious triumph, as for the honour of Argenis . And they were especially these: that it should not be lawful for the Farmers of Customes, or Subsidies, to demand any thing of them, whom the chiefe officers had found to be poore, not through any neglect of their owne, and able to till the ground. Furthermore, that none of the poorer people sessed by the Poll, should imitate the richer sort in idlenesse, by ceasing from their worke, neglecting their Trades, and wearing their Swords, as if they were warriors, in time of peace: but, such who were knowne to be vnable to liue of their meanes, should eyther voluntarily chuse what they would professe, or else be put to publique worke by the Countrey; because they growing poore in peace, through sluggish and sad pride, commit secret villanies, or else voluntarily runne into rebellion and ciuill dissention, to relieue their pouerty by the publique misery. This also did they petition, that there should be no meane Officers for raysing the Subsidies due from the people, neyther should they beset priuate mens houses, nor by their Bayliffes distraine and trouble the Townes-men; that this Office should be in the disposing of all the Citizens, who should chuse out of their owne corporation, such by whom those Monies might more easily be gathered: And that euery Towne should bring the Money so gathered, to the Maior,  & from their hands to be paid to the Gouernor of the Prouince, or, if so pleased the King, it should be brought into the Treasury at Syracusa : for, if any priuate man deny or deferre the paymet, it were better he should presently be forced to it by his own Citizens, by the accustomed Magistrates and knowne Officers, then by the vnciuill insolency of the Treasurers, who by their Collectors, often sell a little forbearance to a poore man at a deare rate; and doe neuer pill and poll more then in distressed houses, gayning to themselues spoyle, by terrifying them, who haue hardly sufficient to satisfie their Taxes and Subsidies. The King, taking pitty of his Subiects, gaue order to Cleobvlvs, that there should some prouision be made by Law, which should free the people of these inconueniences. It was more difficult, as these Embassadours had petitioned, to preuent the mischiefes, by which the multitude of Suites, delayes of Iudges, and corruption of Lawyers, had robbed Townes and Countries. and by the commendation of Argenis , liued more familiarly in the Court. The Syracusanes came to him, and vsed meanes to be receyued vnder so gracious a Protector; that hee would beare to the King the iust demands and prayers of the Sicilians , and, by his perswasions, he would moue the King, being now pacified by his owne good disposition, for the good of the people. his helpe, or the iust commendation of his fauour, that you would thinke him to receiue a courtesie, as often as hee did one. Hee therefore had often commended the Syracusanes to the King, and then especially vpon these griefes, concerning Courts, and matters of Iudgement, whereof the Subiects did now complaine. Doe not thinke, Sir, quoth he, these things to be triuiall, of which the Sicilians desire to be disburdened; I know not whether the ciuill dissentions, which but now you pacified, did more cruelly afflict the Land; and that you should not doubt how farre these miseries doe threaten by full factions, Lycogenes had not more Conspirators with him. Those Sollicitors, I say, those Counsellors, those Clerkes, those Bayliffes, (but I feare to name the Iudges, because you made them) doe so abound; that Tradesmen and Husbandmen which guard the Countrey, are not so many. And from whence haue these multitudes their liuelihood, but by wronging the people, and by the misery and life-bloud of poore Subiects? And truely, with so much the more dammage to the Weale-publique, that if there were fewer belonging to the Law, and those of approued honesty, so many wits which now corrupt themselues with wicked subtilties and deuices, might profit the Common-wealth with better studies. They would eyther bring to light new Disciplines and Arts, or correct the old: so that this plague is not onely guilty of the misery it brings, but of the benefit also which it takes away. But you will excuse the multitude of common Lawyers (suffer mee to call them the Tutors to scolding;) for whom, through the number of contentious persons and wranglers, all the Courts of the Land are not bigge enough. You will say then, that so many Causes cannot bee pleaded, nor so many businesses handled by a lesse company. I will tell you truely by the multitude of Iudges and Pleaders, Suites eyther increase or are continued. Make new Courts of Iustice, there shall not be some wanting that will not make tryall of the fresh torture: but if you will lessen any of the old; part of all controuersies shall so decay, as of their malady, if you take away their medicine. The cause of this trouble of the Court is, because Iudges (lest the small number of causes, their little gaine being taken away, should make their authority also despised) in the rigor of Law doe alwayes finde some, whom they may bridle by their iustice: neyther doe there want iangling Pettifoggers, and a kinde of people worse then these, certaine men acquainted in all the rules, formes, and clauses, to breed doubts; who eyther set others at difference, or they themselues, picking some quarrels with their Neighbours, worke vpon their ignorance in this practice. One of your Prouinces was free from the knowledge of these which bragge their skill in controuersies. The Townes liued in quiet, if any dissention happened betweene Neighbours, a playne but happy equitie did arbitrate betweene them. These, being ignorant of their safety, suffered one of this sort to liue amongst them. Suites presently arise; great controuersies and discord wasted the remnant of their time. So such which belong to Courts, oftner giue life to Suites, then strangle or pacifie them. But howsoeuer they are numberlesse,  & troubling with a kinde of infection all about them: yet if they would let goe whom they had once punished, contented with small correction, it were not so much. Now their differences are perpetuall; that if they had a consideration of their trouble with their charge; you would thinke it fall more heauy, so to ouercome, then presently to be cast. This is that which chiefly requires your care: Cut off these prorogations of Suites; and appoynt a limited time, beyond which it shall be lawfull for no Suites to continue. There are words of Art, and names of Writs, exceeding both number and measure, by which Counsellors and Iudges frustrate their miserable Clyents. They plucke in pieces, ioynt by ioynt, and slowly too, those that might at one blow be destroyed. The Cause is often brought to hearing, often pleaded, some yeeres passe, and yet the examination of Witnesses, as they call it, is not heard. Here the Iudge is not at leisure, the Lawyers neglecting the maine businesse which was the cause of the difference, sticke vpon lesser tryals, sometimes raysed naturally, sometimes by their deuice, out of the first. They giue a flourish to these entrances, and openly tell them, the Iudges cannot possibly vnderstand the truth, except these be first heard. So, one doubt ariseth of another, & the Clyents are vndone by long delayes; a great iniury, Sir, to innocent and poore people: for if a poore man hath a Suite against a rich aduersary, hee fainteth in so long and chargeable a iourney; and at last sitteth downe wearied, neyther being vnreuenged by recouering his right, is lesse angry with his Aduersary, then with this tedious Iustice. But demand not why it pleaseth Iudges and Lawyers to haue their Clyents so long kept in paine: because by delay, and spinning time, their labours gaine estimation. So, Fees (I say) grow to the Lawyer, and reward to the Iudges. They sell cruelly (though lesse would better haue serued the turne) much writing, and much speaking. And so much the worse, imputing that to iustice, wherein they themselues offend. And by custome also of seeing miserable men, and making them so, they cast off all sence of humanity, or rather they beleeue it not miserable to liue in suites. They are so deafe to complaints, as little moued at poore suppliants, and beeing onely reuerenced by them, they loue to haue a long command ouer them. I omit other things wherin they are daily faulty: for they should haue complained of all these grieuances, who put you in mind of correcting the abuses of the Courts. It is better to take a view of the remedies against this mischiefe, and perhaps you shall make a happy beginning by this Statue and ordinance: That they themselues, who haue any difference, should appeare before the Iudges; that their businesse may not depend vpon the meere trust of their Lawyer: by their plainenesse or craft, oftentimes the Iudges may come more rightly to the true vnderstanding of the cause, then by the painting of subtill eloquence. When they shall looke into the cause, as yet without false couering, it shall be in the power of two or three Iudges, to determine whether it be fit for hearing. Neither shall they be held vpon the strict poynt of Law; let the Iudgement be according to equity and Iustice: otherwise let it be vnlawfull to begin, whether it be in iudgements of lesse moment, or else in appeale. But if the difference be more intangled, and requireth witnesses, consideration, and law; then let such Councellours to whom it shall be referred, take the Oath by which they are bound to pleade no vniust cause to their knowledge: and if it shall be proued that they haue broken their Oath, or wronged their Clyent by any collusion in pleading; besides the discredit, they shall receiue such punishment, the feare whereof shall deterre all from daring the like, more then all the gods could. This were furthermore fit to bee enacted, That the Lawiers should take no fees of their Clyents, before the suite bee determined. You shall also enact, that who is cast in the Suite, shall pay but little or nothing to his Councellor; & euen from the beginning of the suit, his Clyent shall become bound to him for that little payment, lest he should be forced to sue afterwards for his own fee. But he who hath the glory of the day, shall satisfie his Lawiers diligence, with so much gold as the Iudges themselues receiue for a reward of their labour. Let there also be a penalty, that none, depending a suite, shall, against the law, tempt with vnlawfull bribery: If any Clyent bribeth, hee shall bee cast in his suite; the Lawier that receiueth, shall be cast ouer the Barre. The accuser shall receiue such rewards as might make him accuse his bedfellow. I will make Lawiers hate delayes, and being earnest for an end, while they shall doe themselues good, they shall profit others. It shall auaile nothing, except you shall also charge by Proclamation; (and that vpon a great penalty, not as we vse to affright offenders for a time) that no suite shall depend before the Iudges more then sixe moneths, except the witnesses are to be sent for out of the Prouince. I deny not then, to haue the time doubled. Such as are accustomed to spinne long delayes, will not brooke this sentence, and in a fume will deny, that such a rabble of causes can be passed ouer in sixe moneths. I will therefore enquire of such, if euery yeere the Catalogue of causes doe not increase in the Court; or whether they would dispatch the old, which so infinitely abound. If they increase, what then shall be done with them? Out of what doore shall wee tumble the increase of so many yeeres? They must indeed be cast out, or ended altogether, not by Iustice, but by lot. But if they determine as many causes long ripe for hearing, as are growing to it, wee demand no more; we agree vpon the number. It is sufficient, I say, that as many causes should bee heard, as the yeere bringeth suites. Suppose they obiect the religious difficulty of searching out the truth, which sometimes may require more then a yeere. That excuse shall not serue them. What are causes so intangled? You your selues, you, the Iudges, haue made them thus intricate. Cast backe your eyes vpon your Predecessors; their iudgements did beare more speed then wee prescribe you: and yet you may not deny them to bee most iust, when for the most part we haue those Lawes in estimation, which were made by them. In our latter times, vnder the shaddow of equity, there are found out such inuentions for the benefit of the Defendants, by which, to say truely, the plainenes of the Law hath bin abused: Non-suites, References, and what might speedily be determined, as it were, in a religious course, are deferred for a longer time. These also neglecting the benefit of the Defendant, for the profit of the Iudges and Lawyers, are so strictly obserued, as if people were made for Lawes, and not Lawes for them. Crop some of them which exceede the proportion of their limited time: for no cause shall out-runne the study and diligent care of sixe moneths; and if they shall desire longer consideration, after the time expired, it shall be lawfull to remoue it out of the Court; neither shall their too curious doubts in the Law, cause any delay. Iudge by your owne consciences then, what you will; forasmuch as oftentimes, after many yeeres and Ages, you giue Iudgements no lesse doubtfully and differently: so that truth doth appeare, not by time, but by diligence. countenance, Whither, saith hee, doth this vehemency, great Prelate, transport thee, who speakest thus to men absent, except perhaps you reckon mee in the number of the Iudges, and warne me by anothers offence? For I heare a complaint by some that liue in the Court, how businesse there also haue but slow proceedings. care of the common good. But perhaps, saith hee, the Iudges will lay the blame on the Lawyers, as if they were the men, who sometimes by direct, sometimes sinister delayes, prolonged their Clyents busines, and encumbred the Commissioners minds with verball circumstances; as if the pleaders could so offend, vnlesse the Iudge did winke at it. The one desireth to prolong the businesse, the other granteth it: Which of these is most faulty? I iudge them indeed more worthy to be blamed, who, when they may hinder these inconueniences, doe not: Neither durst the Lawyer thus wrangle, deferre businesse, and stand vpon triuiall poynts, if hee knew it not to bee an vsual practice, and allowed by the Iudges. Let the Iudge deny respit; let him include all points of controuersie within the space of sixe moneths. Let him account of such as are vnprepared, as of persons conuicted. Then will Lawyers cease from this cunning, and not suffer the right of their Clyents to bee smothered by wrongfull delay. Yet if all this will not alter the Iudges opinions, if they will gainesay mee, and boasting of their sincerity, labour, and discipline, they shall complaine, that beyond all equity they are straitned in this short time of sixe moneths, I doe not forbid you to be mercifull; command them, that what surplusage of businesse is ouer-burdensome to them, they transferre it to learned Counsellours. There are many excellent of them: they may referre to them as many of these Suiters as they please; they may giue sentence, either by themselues or others, for the good of the Common-wealth: so that they suspend not their Clyents beyond the time appointed. You shall find their strength presently renewed; neither will they so giue ouer, that the streame of profit and power should flowe to others: Then bring in more businesse; and they themselues, which but now were so wantonly tyred with paines-taking, will vndergoe it; especially, if you inflict a penalty to this Statute, as you should. But what, you will say, shall become of old causes, which for many yeeres haue depended in these Courts? This yeere surely is not sufficient for them, together with the rest which are dayly brought it. To this purpose, they which sit in iudgement, may also by constraint take to themselues copartners in office, sufficient to cleere the Court. Their Commission shall not extend beyond sixe Moneths: Then the Courts of iustice once cleansed from their ancient corruption, cannot deferre aboue one yeere the punishment of the guilty, and the complaint of the oppressed. mortall, to labour to cure sicke bodies by too much physicke, the King deferred this new physicke, so preseruatiue, vntill the chiefe Officers could bee called together, and Lawes enacted, as it were by an vnanimous consent: for it was not expedient, that the awfull regard of the people towards them, should bee weakened: and it was much to be feared, that in this disorderly Decree, there should bee a greater shew of punishment and reuenge, than of future commodity. The King therefore commanded the other demands which the people requested, to bee exhibited to them which came to the celebration of Argenis her birth- day: but the ordering of these Courts of Iustice was onely promised; and the care of enacting these Statutes was referred to Cleobvlvs .  A multitude of Sicilians come to Meleanders Court in honour of Argenis her Birth-day. The description of a Daunce to Fortune: And the pride and magnificence of Radirobanes .  sorts so filled Eipercte ; that Radirobanes , hauing great care of his premeditated mischiefe, sometimes feared lest hee should be preuented in the rape of Argenis , amongst so many Sicilians . Sometimes would he thinke, that Meleanders Guard and company would hardly gather together to help him in this confused multitude. In the meane time hee neither spared his paines nor his purse, by which he might beautifie his intended Maske: for he desired to gaine to himselfe the credit of Courtship, and to lessen the dis-honour of his intended offence, by gaining the good will of the people. The Euening therefore before Argenis Birth-day, the great Hall in the Court was appointed for the Maske. Supper beeing serued vp in a good houre, the Sardinians and Sicilians flocked thither thicke and threefold. The Officers and Guard set at the doores and entries, could hardly keepe backe the prease; that the out-cry and vprore of such as were beaten backe in the throng, was one part of the Kings pompe. Meleander himselfe goeth to the doores, when the authority of the Officers and Guard could not preuaile, and with a Princely presence, intreated them not to disturbe the shewes, nor trouble him. Archombrotvs was next the King, whom hee willed at his departure, to let such in to the Maske, as he might conueniently, the rest to keepe off by his authority. But he thinking it a matter of deuotion to offend so great a care; and left open the doores, as if hee had not bin able to withstand the violence of the people: ouercharged with the sudden multitude, pressing so thicke, they could hardly stand one by the other. And although vntill the people, ashamed of themselues, grew more quiet: especially after the angry King was seene to withdraw himself from his Chayre by the next doore. But Evrymedes sharply reprooued their amazed boldnesse; while drawne to this choler, that plucking off his masking suites, he commanded the frame to be broken, and the deuices which hung to let the Maskers downe out of the Ayre, to be cast to the ground. At length, by the helpe of Evrymedes, there was a place made free from the people, to receiue Meleander with Argenis . And for the first shew, foure Satyres came from vnder the Hangings; now when they daunced a little confusedly, they cast this Epigram amongst the people, after they had presented it to the King and Argenis , as the Argument of the maske.  Nature stood strong, when onely Satvrne reign'd: Now parted, and in Regiments contain'd Of many gods, shee loseth strength; here Iove With Brothers fights: What iarres, what warres they moue! Becomes this Brothers? Seeke you Scepters so? Rather restore your aged Sire, and bow To him: you'l sooner your fell discord cease In priuate states. But Fortune brings a peace: And turning long her doubtfull Wheele, she drawes, At length, the Brothers to these peacefull Lawes; That Iove in Heau'ns high Starry Court should raigne; Blue Neptvne should possesse the watry Maine; The gods were pleas'd with this condition. This League made glad the earth; the gods resort In troupes, reioycing: Musicke crownes their sport: The gods of Heauen; the gods that swimme in Seas On Fishes backes; and the blacke deities. But to this generall Solemnitie No Goddesse came, whether they kept the Skie; Or else some other region fill'd with brawles. But you, Sicilian Nymphs, be ready all, Mixe with the gods reioycing company. Thou Princely Maid, the heyre of Sicily , Lend Iove thy hand, thy tender feete apply To th' musickes note, that Iove may somewhat see, Better than Iove himselfe; preferring thee To Ivno ; and to Heauen, Sicily . In the meane time, the Trumpets sounding before the shew, fire, imitating the lightening, flasht thorow the rolling of counterfeited Cloudes. Then the frame of Heauen, which they had framed on the highest part of the Stage, began to bee moued, and by little and little fell downe; and opened three windowes, in which the cleere starres shined with fire put to them, and lighted with their brightnesse the ornaments of Gold and Purple. In the midst of the three Chambers sate Ivpiter ; in the other two, Neptvne and Plvto ; about them sate many Cvpids , as so many seruants, with curled haire and little bodies: they had Bowes at their backes, and bore brandishing in their right hands, two Darts of different poynts and effects: these comming out with their masters in a comely measure, vpon the Stage couered with Tapestry, lightly runne ouer the ante-maske: In the meane time, Ivpiter , led by the Musickes note, went to his Brethren: and anon, as they could not agree in their demands, both by gesture in body, and lookes fitting that purpose, they were deuided asunder. When they had thus done twice or thrice, suddenly the goddesse Fortvne appeareth on the Stage, fitting on a Globe, who danced also to the Musicke, and commanded them to come, hiding the Royall Robes for which the gods did striue, in her garment girt about her. They, guiding their steps by the musicke, came to her, and put their hands in the Lottery. Ivpiter , in the bosome of Fortune, found a three-edg'd lightning made of gold; Neptvne , a three-forked Mace; and Plvto was most grieued finding the blacke Speare of hell. Another swift Cloud brought downe to Ivpiter , as King of the heauenly powers, the chiefest of the celestiall gods, Mars, Apollo, Mercvry . And presently the Sea began to swell with various waues, which had a Rocke of sea-mosse and shels, from whence Protevs, Triton , and Glavcvs leapt downe to their god voyces, came down, imitating the roaring of the Sea. Neptvne had scant taken notice of them, when from another side, a pleasant, though duskie sight, (for it resembled the Elysian Field) brought Minos, Æacvs , and great rich god Plvto no longer despised the power of his gouernment. The gods of heauen were arrayed in purple; the Sea-gods in blue; and the infernall in a darke murrey, most maiestically terrible; and each of them has his ornaments besides. The Sun-beames shined about Apollo; Mars had wouen in his purple Robes the shapes of warre, with his sword in his hand. Mercvry was knowne by his Cap, and wings on his feet, with his white wand and rod, powerfull in procuring sleepe. But Triton hanged his crooked Trumpet by his side. Protevs had a double and different looke, by which hee shewed his disposition to change. Glavcvs did weare such a beard, as he was found by the powerfull grasse neere Anthedon Minos in a Damsell numbred an hundred Townes. An Oake and Ants filled the garment of Æ acvs , some looking vpwards like men, others not yet changed. Rhadamanthvs did beare the Chim aera of his Licia , exprest in liuely colours: and that hee might approue himselfe to be discontented with monsters and vices, Bellerophon sitting on Pegasvs , tamed by Minerva , subdued her. Euery one in these habits danced to the musicke; but the heauenly gods more frollickly; the Sea-gods hopped a little more rudely, and sometimes gathered vp their fishy part, growing from their middle; and made those parts dance on the ground againe. But for the gods of hell, their steps were not disagreeing from their frowning and wrinkled foreheads, yet they danced in their rough shapes of anger and scorne. This so disagreeing fashion of the most differing gods, was ruled by one and the same accord in musicke. Sometimes they fall off one from the other, and presently cloze all together, and that in another change: sometimes are they turned into a Ring; sometimes into a direct lyne: sometimes should you see them hand in hand; sometimes euery one single; then againe in payres most obsequiously gouerning their whole bodies to the direction of the musicke: at length, all the figures being ended, her selfe into the Dance. Then when the chiefe Ladies and Damsels had danced, the twelue gods made an end with a new Dance. After this, they goe seuerall wayes. Ivpiter is carried into heauen; Neptvne was hid in the Sea; returnes: and then a small showre of rayne did wet the beholders thorow the whole house; sweet water by little and little distilling downe thorow the hanging Clouds. Some praysed the inuention of the Princely and sumptuous shew; some extolled rest, through the greedy desire of his prepared villany, enioying no quiet all the night, presently vpon Sun-rising goeth downe to the Hauen, and vieweth his Gally; to the lanching whereof he had inuited the King and Argenis to the Sea shore. Then he turneth aside to that part of the shore, where he had appointed the Royall Dynner to be prouided. They had wyned great Tents, with stakes rammed into the ground, and fastned with ropes; the sands also were couered with mats of strawe: They had trimmed them with boughes of trees, and Iuie made into Garlands; which, representing Argenis name, and the seuerall pictures of men and beasts, couered both sides of the Dyning-roome; and vpon the bed, on which the Lady was to dyne, a Table crowned with Bayes, did beare these Verses:  O Mayd, to whom, in her first fairest age, And she, whose Helme an Oliue branch does weare; Deigne this place grace; and enter mildly heere This shady Arbor: So does Cynthia light Her Chariot, made by Phoebvs lustre bright, And to the Woods retyres; so when the stroke Of Warre is past, and her chaste Altars smoke, And doth with gifts enrich her suppliants Feasts. Come, Nymph, and from the Seaes shore fire with loue The bluish gods; pleas'd Neptvne mounts aboue His calmed waues, but wounded with thy sight, He sighes, and thinkes not Thetis halfe so bright.  The Preparation of the King of Sardinia , to carry away Meleander and the Treason.  the chiefe of the Citizens, shewed how much hee had tendred them, and commanded those Proclamations which Cleobvlvs had drawne, to be set vp in the Market place, and to be sent forth thorow all Cities; and assured them of his great care of Law-suites, which could not presently be redressed. Which being speedily proclaimed, the people ouerioyed of themselues, and by reason of the Festiuall day, followed the Princes with a great showting to The Sardinian King, beholding Argenis comming as a most assured prey, and tryumphing in another mirth then was suspected, caused Dynner to bee prouided in a most solemne and Courtly fashion: It was but foure houres before night, when they arose from Dynner to see the Gally. Trumpets and Corners resounded euery where along the Shore, and on the tops of three Masts, hanged Ribonds of seuerall colours, for Sayles, subiect to all winds by their owne lightnesse; the Decke was filled with Mariners and Soldiers, as if it had beene vnder Sayle for a triumph or Sea-fight: the Shore and Boats could not containe the multitude, making a confused noyse, as often as the Trumpets gaue them notice that the Pageant set forward. The Gally was then at that time of purpose slowly wafted out of the Hauen. But hee had promised not far from the shore, in three Boats, and all about the water. This new inuention allured the hearers by the nouelty thereof, because many of them as yet had not heard of it. Vpon this hope therefore he brought backe Meleander and Argenis into his Pauillion, and made a long discourse of what they should see: the likenesse of Fishes, breathing out of their mouthes fire in the water, which diuing into the depth, they could not quench; the Boats encompassed by these fishes, should seeke refuge from fiery Images, whose poles did neuer burne more violent, then when they were vnderwater. While hee was discoursing, sometimes the care of his approaching Treason withdrew him; and leauing Meleander , he admonisheth these workes should be frustrated, by being either too slow or too rash. There were a hundred Torches placed about the Tent, out of which the Kings were to sit and see it. Hee had also appointed, that vpon a signe giuen, these should be put out, (for they were hanged by very few cords) and that Argenis and Sardinians and Soldiers, although for the most part they were ignorant of the Plot, being called, came leisurely, and were secretly commanded to execute what Vertiganes should command. He, though vnwilling, tooke a care of the desperate enterprise, committed to his charge, with two other Noblemen that were priuy to it. It was almost beyond beliefe, that Sicily could be preserued from so neere a ruine. But such are oftentimes the powerfull wolks of the gods, that their suddaine scourge should take wicked men in the very act of their sinne, when they thinke themselues secure of successe; that wicked men should neuer be without feare; nor vertue, though in danger, without hope. By fortune, sand, when the rest were beholding the Gally lanched: hee vnderstood the Sardinian language, although he had dissembled vntill that day. A certaine Souldier of Radirobanes Guard, parting lately from Vertiganes, meeting one of his companions wandring on the shore without his weapon; Is it lawfull (saith he for thee alone, fellow-souldier, to be seene this day without a Launce and a Sword? And when he denyed that he had receiued any command to arme himselfe, both of them ioyning with others whom they met, spake nothing afterwards, which Archombrotvs could heare. But maruelling what need these Sardinians had to be armed in peace, and in the time of feasting, viewed all their habits, as if he walked that way, and found not any without his weapons and Armes. Some, besides a sword, had a Speare, others a Iauelin, and many were furnished with Italian Darts. But few of them, and those onely, as for the Kings Guard, had eyther Target or Helmet, lest the Treason should be discouered by too much prouision. These things bred suspition and feare in Archombrotvs , of his owne accord ill brooking the Sardinians . Neyther was it without the gods appoyntment, that he should be so much afraid at so slight an occasion; for the custome of Souldiers might haue excused these weapons to one that had beene carelesse, But hee, whether because hee loued Argenis , or because hee wished some offence in Radiorbanes ; Ah mee, (saith hee) doth a Louer, so often refused, vse violence? and doe they intend to carry away Meleander , as if they were not contented with Argenis? Why are they intreated to stay all night? Being strucken with a sudden amazement, hee thought there was no better meanes to discouer the conspiracy, then by Vertiganes his Brother; for hee had lyen desperately sicke for many dayes: neyther was it likely, if the Sardinians intended any Treason, that they would leaue him in the Towne, and betray him to his Enemies fury. Hee went therefore in poast-haste to Eipercte, and when he came thorow that part of the Court which was appoynted for the Strangers, hee espyed opportunely a Seruant of Radirobanes , who had the keeping of the Kings lodgings; hee was called Libachanes: him and locking the doore; feigning a desire to looke for something in the Chamber, if hee were at leisure. The Seruant, both respecting the person of doubted not to vnlocke the Chamber-doore. Archombrotvs remembred, when hee came along twice with Meleander to Radirobanes , that hee had seene a Box of most curious worke, in-layde with Ebony and Iuory, vpon a by-Table, not farre from the Couch-Bed, which was also in-layde with Checker-worke of Siluer, and carued in the Ioynts, and the End. There, hee had heard, that his Iewels of greatest value were kept, and Letters of chiefest secrecy: and therefore, as hauing his minde vpon other businesse, hee casteth his Eye about the empty Table, and in vaine, searcheth for the Cabinet, thorow all the Chamber: and that the Seruant might not perceiue it, hee deceiued him with an easie deuice: Vpon the Arras hung two Pictures, both of which Radirobanes much esteemed: In the one an Eagle, as it were, stooping from aboue, did set a Crowne vpon the Head of Radirobanes his Father: the other was of stayed earnestly looking vpon them, as if hee had come of purpose to see them; for they were left there; neyther had they taken any thing out of the Chamber, of prouision or furniture, saue onely the Box. The coniecture therefore of his thoughts, and his suspition increasing, none who could certainely discouer it to him. But when by the solitarinesse, hee perceyued that his sicke Brother was gone; (for indeed they had carryed him to the Ships in a Litter, as soone as it was day, as if, by the Physicions aduice, the Sea would doe him good;) Archombrotvs feared lest the night and treachery should preuent him, while hee was thus carefully in search of the Plot. He therefore calleth for two Captaines of those which guarded the Castle, (for what diligence could so suddenly gather together the rest of the Souldiers which were scattered abroad?) and setting a countenance, as if hee had beene sent by Meleander : Go to your Souldiers, (saith he) and presently, but very priuately, bring them forth to the Sea-shore. Being sent downe, let them flocke by Companies neere Radirobanes his Tent. A Sword and Iauelin will bee sufficient for them, lest, if they should be obserued to be better armed, they should giue occasion of his notice. I will first be vpon the shore, and diligently bring vnto you whatsoeuer the King shall command. Goe, I pray you, and shew your diligent care to the King.  King. Argenis feigneth her selfe sicke. Radirobanes vseth meanes to stay Argenis : Hee is angry to see his Enterprise frustrate.  the Shore, when not farre from Radirobanes , hee met with Evrymedes , and with a distempered looke; I feare much (saith hee) lest Fortune haue cast vs vpon another Lycogenes . Then, poynt by poynt, hee re-counteth the seuerall signes of some Treason which hee had discouered: That Radirobanes had carryed away, out of his Ward-robe, all things of greatest value: that Sardinians in Armes. Then Evrymedes , not suffring him to make an end of his Speech, replyed, how glad hee was, that Archombrotvs and himselfe were of the same opinion; that hee was long since suspicious and affrighted at the sight of the Sardinians , who walked about the Kings Tent in thicke troupes, not without order and command. But after this which Archombrotvs had related, hee doubted nothing of the Treason. What Perithovs haue wee here? What Thesevs hath made him thus bold, to take away his Wife by violence? But wee must vse cunning, that Meleander may suffer himselfe to be freed from this danger. He is so fearefull to displease Radirobanes , that he will neglect himselfe. Goe first, Archombrotvs , and when thou hast awaked him with the greatnesse of the danger, I will helpe thee strongly, and double his feares; and the tokens of it. In the meane time, I will appoynt the Souldiers to be in a readinesse not farre off, which should watch the next night following. It happened by good fortune, that when Archombrotvs came to the Kings, leisure; to whom hee humbly, and with a low voyce, spake: I haue put on a different countenance to the newes which I bring, because I would not haue these Parricides which stand about you, thinke that I giue you any warning. But all this pompe is prepared for you as a Sacrifice; whom, I vnderstand, this purpose doth hee deferre his promised sights, vntill the night may giue him better opportunity for his Rape, all things being filled with tumult and vprore. When hee had related his reasons to this purpose, Evrymedes came vnlooked for, and filled the King with feare, that his ioynts trembling and doubtfull in his minde, hee asked them, what counsell they could giue to preuent this sudden mischiefe. It was manifest, that there was no other remedy, then eyther presently to flye, before the Plot was ripe, or else to defend himselfe there, by the guard of his owne Souldiers. But flight was thought altogether the fittest, for so many Souldiers could not suddenly be gathered together, without acknowledging suspicion, that they should seeme by fearing, rather to offer an iniury, then to repell it. Furthermore, Why should Meleander bee put in danger; Why Argenis ? especially when the order and manner of the Plot was not yet knowne, and perhaps the Sardinians had so cunningly appoynted their nightly villany, by some stratageme, which could not bee restrayned by a disorderly opposition. Merrily (saith the King,) and as it were to walke about, will I goe out of the Tent, I will perswade Radirobanes to follow, and also Argenis , whom you shall aduise by the way, Evrymedes , that suddenly shee should counterfeit her selfe vehemently sicke, when wee shall be amongst our owne people. The occasion of her departure will be excusable, and as it were grieued at her sicknesse, I will accompany her. After hee had spoken, hee look't vpon Radirobanes and Argenis : Wee shall lose (saith hee) a dainty Euening. It is better walke out in the fresh Ayre, and now it is not so hot, the Sunne being declyning: Wee shall haue sitting sufficient anon, when the Pageants are to be seene. Then hee went to the doores of the Tent, and all followed. In this troupe, Meleander began to discourse with Radirobanes , that by his absence, Evrymedes might the easier signifie to the young Lady what hee had commanded; and shee, being disquieted in her sudden thoughts, although no body had discouered the cause of her Fathers aduice, (for Vertiganes his comming preuented Evrymedes his speech;) yet shee fayled not much from the truth in her fearefull and disturbed thoughts. In the meane time, Archombrotvs , what friend soeuer to the King hee met with, perswaded him not to forsake his Lord and Master; and how the seuerall bands of Souldiers, sent for both by himselfe and Evrymedes , were in euery corner of the Fields; when Argenis , by aduice, fainted willingly, and betaking her selfe to Selenissa , with a low voyce, I am very ill (Mother) saith shee, and presently standeth still. Wine, Perfumes with a most diligent request. A troupe of people presently gathering together, excessiuely increased about her. And Meleander , who was gone a little before, returned in the midd'st of their counterfeited feares. But hath any (saith Argenis ) sent for my Litter? Neyther, being asked of her disease, would shee answer any thing certainely, but that her heart fayled, her eyes were dull, and her head light. But Radirobanes cryed out, that there was no need of a Litter, shee might sooner be carryed backe into his Tent hard-by in a Chayre. Meleander excusing it, said, that the Towne was more conuenient, both for physicke and rest; hee appoynted also those that should goe with the Horse-litter, and gaue thankes to paines and sicknesse. And now Radirobanes being carefull, not so much for would suffer the weake Lady to be carryed a full mile, (for it was so farre from Eipercte ) and in the first fit of her sicknesse, which it may be would not last; that it were much more restfull for her in the next Pauilion. As yet all these things were carryed as it were in mutuall loue, when was not so settled vpon this day, that his long-hoped-for happinesse might not returne: hee should suffer Argenis to depart, and goe himselfe with her to Eipercte , deferring the shew of the promised Fire-workes, vntill shee recouered strength, and her Father should bring her backe to the shore in his honest plainenesse to be carryed away; hee had almost perswaded him, when feeling her Pulse, though against her will, and also marking her eyes, and drawing of her breath, at first began to wonder, and afterwards to deny, that shee had any signe of sicknesse about her. Turning therefore to Meleander , hee intreated him in good earnest to lay aside all griefe: That it was a very light sicknesse, whatsoeuer it were that troubled Argenis . But feigned her sicknesse to colour her flight: wondring who had discouered his Conspiracy; who had reuealed it to Meleander , by little and little fell into violent rage;  & being desperately bent to vse open force, hee looked about for his people, and laid his hand on his Swords Hilt, when he perceiued fewer Sardinians then Sicilians about him; that hee could not hope for victory, if hee would haue made tryall by violence. In the meane time also, came Meleander's Physicion, who being warned by Evrymedes what hee should dissemble, told them, that Argenis her sicknesse was farre otherwise, then Radirobanes his seruant did coniecture: That it was a continued and extreme sicknesse, which would hang long vpon her: They should haste to carry her to the Palace: that all delayes were hurtfull to so, not induring his skill to be slighted: for, what signe of sicknesse could hee see? What by her looke? What by the colour of her lips? Whether had shee a cold Sweat? Whether the Pulse did not beat orderly? Neyther did the Sicilian play his part lesse violently. Certainely there had beene an excellent sight about the doubtfulnesse of physicke, if the trouble and importance of businesse which was in hand, would haue giuen way to such a iest. While these two are wrangling about this, the Litter-men take vp Argenis : and Radirobanes following with his best indeuours, he that meant not to returne, could not temper his violence: Hee laid his hand vpon the Litter, and did now more then intreat Argenis to stay. The quarrell also began to grow betweene the Sardinians and Sicilians , and Archombrotvs went to deliuer by force, the Litter, which Radirobanes laboured to stay. But the gods, for the good fortune of that day. What a streame of Noble bloud did this vp-roare indanger! an Earth-quake able to haue swallowed Sicily , and to haue made an end of Poliarchvs , though absent? But the wisdome of offer violence to Meleander , speaking yet kindely to him, as his Guest. But howsoeuer, the tumult ended, and Argenis being gone, Meleander also himselfe mounted in his Litter, guarded with troupes of his owne Souldiers, returned to the Towne. The end of the Third Booke. BARCLAY HIS ARGENIS: OR, The loues of Poliarque and Argenis . The Fourth Booke .  him, touching Poliarchvs and Argenis .  diuersity of thoughts. Sometimes he was troubled with the shame; sometimes with the ill lucke of his enterprize. How fairely had the businesse gone on at the first? How long had hee held Argenis and Meleander in his power, in his Pauilion? And then, whether it were his euill Genius , or some Mortall, had discouered his plots. Must hee then vndergoe the dishonour of a wicked practice, without the comfort of reward, or obtaining his desire? After his giuing Sicily her liberty, hauing stayned the glory of his victory, hee must now depart, not as an Enemy onely, but as a Robber. Anon, euen gnashing his teeth for anger, hee runnes vp and downe the shore, with a minde so vselesse to any other businesse, as hee scarcely perceiued the night to come on. At length, Vertiganes tooke heart to come to him: and that he might haue the better hearing from his angry Prince, hee did at first make shew to be troubled with like passions. And when by this meanes hee had gayned opportunity to giue him aduice; It is now night (said he,) and yet (Sir) you still stay here, too secure in the confidence of your valour. There are many about you: and there is no need, that all should know, how your minde is perplexed. But whither thinke you to retyre this night? Meleander calls you to the Towne: but who can imagine, you can with safety mist to a reconciliation with him? We are all too deare to you, to be strucke dead with the feare of so dangerous a hazard vnto you: your owne Nauy will be much fitter to receiue you. Detest this Land, that hath beene your cause of so much griefe. When you shall once be priuate with a few in your Admirall-Gally, you will haue the freer vent for your anger, and better resolue what is to be done. heard Vertiganes , yet betooke himselfe to the Boat, that stayed ready for him; either with the mightinesse of his rage, or with deepe thought of his businesse, not speaking a word, till hee came to his Gally. But when he was set downe, onely with three of his Nobles, in his Royall Cabin, and euoluing his blacke thoughts that carryed his minde thorow many and confused imaginations; first hee pluckt from his necke the Picture of place to hatred and wrath: Then casting his countenance towards Vertiganes ; I will (saith he) make this a day of greater sorrow to Meleander , then to my selfe; he shall now more hate Argenis then mee: I will take the Office of the Furies, disquiet the Father, and defame the Daughter; then also at leisure will I behold the sport, and take pleasure at the misery of my enemies; or, if it shall be commodious for my purpose, I will oppose him with an open warre. Fetch mee Inke and Paper presently, and immediately he wrote a Letter to this effect with his owne Hand:  first opposed my selfe against your Enemies. I aske pardon of the Sicilians , whom I haue vanquished with my powers, and restored to your tyranny, when they were like to free themselues from it. But if it was troublesome to you to haue mee daily in your sight, by whose meanes and power you are now a King, yet you might haue sent mee away with more honour, then, with the brand of Conspiracy: for, to whom would you not giue notice, how much you did feare mee, when first haste into the Towne, from my Pauilion? So, you hoped to blot out all debts, by finding the first fault: But you can delude none so: For, why should I wrong you, who offered my life to danger, to preuent your harme? I must confesse, I desired a marriage with your Daughter; and when you approued not of the Alliance, I determined to take her by force: and that you may not please your selfe so much hereafter with your Argenis , the Royall bloud of Sardinia knoweth not how to brooke a dishonourable Wedlocke. With what Eye should I see her honoured in the sacred Temple of the chaste Goddesse, vnworthy of her first Marriage-girdle, her Virgin Garland, or any other Badge of Virginitie; and to conclude, being of long familiarity with one newes of her shame? You are too wary of your friends: learne to know those, of whom you should feare: That Theocrine , which you thought had beene By the helpe of Argenis : hee was admitted first into the Nurcery for a Virgin, and afterwards into the Temple for Pallas . Can you thinke her chaste, who being in loue with a Stripling, concealed the defiler of your Castle, which you had dedicated only to Women, who was daily with her Loue; and who at length deceiued her Father? Leaue off therefore suspition, vnworthy my condition, and thy thought; as if I knowing this, should so earnestly desire her in marriage, who hath no chaste part in her. I must confesse, shee pleased me at first, when I arriued heere, before I had notice of her dishonesty: But the gods haue fauoured Sardinia better; that when you might haue made mee your Sonne-in-law, you neglected it. Yet after I had knowledge of her secret vnchastity, I so couered my lothing by counterfeiting loue, that I was content to looke to my selfe, and not hurt her, though deseruing: Take to your selfe your Daughter, and your Kingdome also, restored by my helpe. But that ingratitude should not euery way bee rewarded, and that you should not abuse my too much gentlenesse, I will not haue the Treasury of Sardinia bee punished for your folly. This is too much already, that many of my Subiects haue lost their blood in your seruice. Yet I mention not my owne paines, because I will not sell them. But pay me part of my charges, which you should indeed altogether discharge: For I haue disbursed them about my Nauy, and in paying Souldiers, that you might liue and raigne. I am content it should be valued but at three hundred Talents. What I haue laid out more for you, may easily be knowne, by casting vp the accounts of my Treasury. But repay this little, except you had rather haue it taken from you. To renounce your hospitality, were superfluous, when you haue done first, by offering vnhospitable iniury. And that yet you shall vnderstand my fidelity by what I haue told you; vnlesse compelled, I could not wish you hurt; and as long as I could, I suffered you to loue Argenis .   Letters, and reades them to Argenis. Selenissa is questioned: her complaints and despaire.  mischiefe, hee calleth his most faithfull Councellours, and shewes them the Letter, almost forgetting his owne paine, in hope of anothers. They were astonished at the strangenesse of the plot; but by the misery of their seruitude, they praised that openly, which amongst themselues they priuately detested. Then was it demanded, who should carry the Letters to Meleander : for it seemed dangerous, and almost capitall boldnesse. But Radirobanes being also cruell towards his owne Souldiers; Let not the Herald, saith hee, know his danger; he shall goe without feare, and secure by my authority: But if Meleander shall put him to any torture, it will be a great aduantage for mee, to gaine a new and iust occasion of falling out by so base blood. When therefore they had argued amongst themselues some time, a certaine Souldier, to whom Vertiganes had an ancient grudge, is appointed for this office; Vertiganes himselfe preferring this man: And hee happy, as he thought, by the malicious election of an enemy: and being attired Herald-like, he was wafted before Sunne-rising in a little Boat to the Hauen. Word is presently carried to Meleander , that there is a Herald come from Radirobanes . He, troubled in mind, and sorrowfull for the discontent of his Guest, had then by chance sent for some of his chiefe Councellours about him. Besides, his free courtesie, which almost was counted a fault in him, this fauour receiued from Radirobanes , did so worke in him; that he wished better to the Sardinian King than to himselfe. It is doubtfull, quoth hee, whether he would haue wronged me: but this is certaine, that wee fled from him, as if hee had beene a Traitour: howsoeuer, wee must be friends with him; and though he could doe vs no other harme, yet wee should feare an ill report: he will neuer seeme to be expelled iustly, whom we receiued in the time of danger, as a blessing from the gods. After he had thus spoken, all were silent; for this pensiuenesse of and Evrymedes imagining themselues to be checkt, because they gaue the King first warning that he should take heed of Radirobanes , openly began to repine: so that youthfull violence forced Archombrotvs to these words: I perceiue ( o King) that Radirobanes and I cannot be both excused: If I did draw you to vniust enmity, why doe you deferre to punish mee? But if to day you are safe by my diligence, and Evrymedes his fore-sight, doe not disquiet this most happy day by your doubtfull thoughts; nor as yet question, whether you had rather offend Radirobanes , or suffer Argenis to bee a Captiue to him. This freedome of Archombrotvs was most pleasing to all, especially to were at discord with Radirobanes . The King himselfe excused his feares to it: that they should take heed, lest Radirobanes might delude strangers, and such as were ignorant in the businesse. I will send to him, some, who shall tell how much I grieue, that hee would rather goe to his Fleete, than to his old lodging with mee: and how I would intreate him to returne backe into the Hauen; and that being so neere Sicily , he should not aduenture himselfe to the Seas inconstancy: likewise I will command great store of prouision to be sent him in Boats, and reward his friends with gifts. So that I thinke no body shall count mee vngratefull to a Guest, to whom I had beene so liberall of courtesie. That opinion lesse displeased; and now the King had named Timonides for his Embassadour; when the comming of Radirobanes his Herald put all their thoughts in suspence. The King commanded him to bee called in; and when he deliuered his Letters, the King asked him kindly, as he was wont, how fared his Guest Radirobanes ? Then replyed the Herald, as hee was commanded; That Meleander should vnderstand all things by the Letters which hee had brought; and then goes a little aside. Meleander suspecting some trouble, goeth to the next Chamber, that the Herald might not obserue his motion and his lookes while hee was reading. Argenis followeth her Father, and the chiefe of the Nobility. But after he had opened the Seale, sticking at euery word, and being vrged with taunts, at last hee commeth to that part of the Letter, where the disgrace of Argenis and Poliarchvs was expressed: his countenance presently growing red, and afterwards pale, he shaked through euery limme. Then comming to his strength, he waued much inraged, but against whom he could not tell: sometimes he was angry with first fit, was vncapable of all iudgement or counsell. No body durst speake to him thus outragiously fuming; but hee himselfe striuing to conceale all signes of disquietnesse, withdrew himselfe to the next Chamber, and withall, commanded Argenis to follow him, to whom hee said nothing else, but that she should read those Letters, and sitteth down vpon the Couch; and likewise diligently viewing her lookes, hee drew many distempered sighes. Argenis being affrighted at the reading, started, but yet not as at a iust occasion; and, impatient of the iniury, with her eyes sparkling, and an angry brow, she threatned reuenge. One griefe aboue the rest, troubled her in this extasie, that her familiarity with Poliarchvs was become knowne, and she feared left the accusation should seeme the truer, and that her Father would vse her the harder, because shee had concealed it so long: Now while she was imagining how her trust was deceiued in so neere a secret, Selenissa's familiar acquaintance with the King of Sardinia , came into her remembrance. But she might not much deliberate, or long be silent; falling therefore downe at her Father's feet, and interrupted by sudden sighes, yet not without cunning, she thus spake: I would not haue you expect, Sir, that I should curiously purge my selfe of this fault obiected against mee; for I will not giue my most opprobrious enemy this content, that I should thinke to giue any other account of my chastity, then that hitherto I haue pleased you, a good and wise Father. I haue one thing to excuse, that I haue beene more trusty to Poliarchvs , then you would haue wished, when he intreated me, by the safety which he brought to vs both, that I would conceale from you, what he had done to free you from that eminent danger. Now, since I am compelled by another mans discouery, to giue Poliarchvs his due praises; It is hee, Sir, whom wee called Theocrine ; being desirous to see mee, hee tooke that womanish habit vpon him, that he might be receiued into the Castle; but he amended the fault of this bold attempt, by the rare modesty of his carriage: for, if you will beleeue mee rather then Radirobanes , wee knew him not to be a man, before he had freed you and me from those night- Traitours, with that courage, which made you beleeue him to be more than a mortall: but then departing from the Castle, he discouered himselfe to mee and valour from you. Afterwards returning to the Court, it is approued by your affection towards him, how much he did excell all others. If you shall condemne my silence, thinke, that I could not giue him a lesse reward, than that I should suffer him to want those honors from you due to his deseruings: but if you feare greater matters, because I, being a Maid, suffered his secret intents to bee concealed; I challenge my greatest enemy for the truth; I meane whole circumstance to Radirobanes . Except shee had beene a most wicked Caitiffe, and had swelled with falshood and hatred towards mee, shee would not haue violated that trust of secresie, neither would shee haue reuealed that to Strangers, which shee concealed from you: yet my innocency will not feare to call her a witnesse. If I haue deserued your displeasure, and haue lasciuiously wronged my vnspotted fame, I will reuenge vpon my selfe the wrongs done to you and Chastity; then also let out that blood, that was vnworthy to bee deriued from you. In the midst of her speech, she imbraceth her Fathers knees, sometimes kisseth his hand, and sometimes looked vpon the old man so mournfully, that now, in the opinion of a louing Father, she was innocent. Yet many things did trouble him: the necessary enmity with Radirobanes ; the suspition of the people vpon the accusation of Argenis ; and howsoeuer that she were chaste, yet it was probable, that her loue to Poliarchvs had made her neglect sent for, by a seruant that kept the doore, he commanded the old woman to be fetcht. None of the Nobility did know what secret businesse was betweene them; but that they did beleeue it to bee of importance, in that the King had such priuate discourse with his Daughter onely. Full of doubts therefore, they coniectured and expected seuerall things. Selenissa , thinking nothing lesse, then that for which she was called, enters the Kings Chamber; in which, the solitarinesse it selfe, and the Kings countenance, her conscience also oftentimes with secret terrour foretelling miseries at hand, disquieted her, when she had least thought of it. And presently Argenis , enraged at her, with an vnusuall looke, whether her Father willing it, or not induring delay through anger; I intreat you, mother, quoth shee, by Radirobanes , (for what can I name to you more pleasing or more honourable?) that you would speake heere before your King and mine, what familiarity I haue had with blame, that you haue hitherto concealed it, whatsoeuer it be: I haue got your pardon for that, onely speake freely what you know. The old woman stood trembling for feare, and her sight fayling; yet as she was most subtill, she quickly recalled her spirits, that this passion might rather seeme to be innocency, detesting those suspitions, than of any note of a detected mischief. And to whom shall I first speake, saith shee, when I am accused by both of you of treachery? Or what so disordered accusation is this? I know (Lady) no familiarity of Radirobanes with my selfe, nor of Poliarchvs with you. But what a sacriledge were it, that you should thinke your worth could bee battered by any suspition? Nay, answers Argenis , leaue off thy impudence, behold Radirobanes his Letters to the King, by which he sheweth how you haue discouered Poliarchvs his disguise, both vnder the names of confessed all this to my Father; and hee hath taxed my innocency with reprochfull dishonesty; but I know not whether by your report: for this purpose onely you are called; speake freely, as the gods shall helpe you: speake the truth, before you shall be forced to confesse by torment, whether I haue defiled the reputation of my Family.  which Argenis was much grieued; her Epitaph. The King holdeth a Councell about Radirobanes and his Herald. The returne of the King of Sardinia into his Countrey.  who hee thought would not haue vrged her so farre to speake, if shee did not rely on her owne innocency; thus spake; I will not haue those things examined with trouble; neither will I endure you, Selenissa , except you discouer what you haue knowne by Poliarchvs , with greater honesty, than before you concealed it. The old woman, ouercome with remorse of conscience, and falling downe at Meleander's feet; All that I can speak (saith she) is this ( o King) Nothing can be more spotlesse or innocent then Argenis , and more treacherous then Radirobanes . If you will suffer me to returne to my Chamber, I will easily resolue you my assured signes; and specially by certaine Letters, which shall giue you that light, that such suspicions may no more disquiet your thoughts: neither shall you heereafter wonder, why be long: I could now haue returned, while we doe heere talke to no purpose. The King not knowing what to doe, because of her great promises, willeth her therefore presently to goe, and not to iest with him in this busines, yet so to carry it, that these differences should not come to the eares of any of the Nobility. Neither did Argenis hinder her, fearing lest she should seeme to offer delay to her, as suspecting shee might lay open greater presumptions against her. But the old woman, as soone as shee got out of their sight, hastened to her Chamber, with an vnusuall speede; and plucking the doore after her, I am once more at my owne liberty, and now I can giue sentence vpon myselfe, and not expect my doome from others. O most vnfortunate woman! haue I therefore liued so long, that I might not dye guiltlesse? But what did so blinde mee, that I should thinke the reward of treason could euer bee safe? How did I forsake my obedience? Why did I trust a rash Young-man, and of whom I had a iealousie, because of his many vices? Why did I betray my trust and loue to my Foster- child, by his promises and gifts, hauing spent so many yeeres, and hauing had so much experience? Thou doest consider these things too late, Selenissa ; It had beene vertue in thee to haue bridled thy minde from sinne. It is the fashion of Theeues to repent as thou dost, because their villanies did not take effect. Did Radirobanes therefore suffer mee to fall by most hatefull discouery, who had nothing to picke a quarrell with mee, except as men are weary of all other things, so of too much good will? O impiety! whom shall I dare looke in the face? To whom shall I flie for succour? Or who will suffer mee to complaine of falshood, who was first false my selfe? And am I yet slow to leaue this world? Why rather doe I not redeeme my fault, by seeking a death worthy my first vertues, and so wash away my late Treason? What should I farther expect? Argenis loatheth mee; I cannot excuse my Treason; and perhaps the King will vse some other meanes to execute his wrath stirred vp by my offence, and his Daughters sad complaints. Neither is it yet knowne, for ought I can vnderstand, that Radirobanes was perswaded by my aduice to carry Argenis away, which is the chiefe thing wherein I haue offended. When this shall be knowne, (for what can I thinke now will be kept secret?) what length of time, or what gods can remoue from my Soueraignes thoughts the remembrance of so heynous an offence? But be they neuer so mercifull, they will for euer banish me their sight. I shall depart hated of all, fearing the angry Princesse, neither safe alone nor in company. I am reserued for heauy punishment; and shall esteeme by my owne merits, all mens discourse of mee. As yet thou art worthy of greater shame, Selenissa , except thou preuentst it by death. At these words, shee taketh vp her writing-Tables, in which shee writeth these lynes, scarce plaine enough to be read:  To Meleander and Argenis , most worthy Princes: punishment. Now take my blood, which is not yet so distained with my offence, but that it may be offered to the gods. And doe not rather iudge of the greatnesse of my fault, than of the greatnesse of my repentance, by the strangenesse of the reuenge which I take of my selfe. You your selues, whom I haue wronged, shall beleaue that my penitency is greater than my offence. For, whether it was by the decree of the Fates, or benummed with sorcery, I confesse that I rashly disclosed this great secresie, of the valour and concealement of Poliarchvs : But, against your Honour, most deare Lady, if I did euer speake any thing, or could; I wish the gods to bee so angry with mee, as I haue beene false to you. Beleeue me a dying woman, and forgiue this one fault, for the rest of my long approued life: or, if that be too much, for this weapon, which doth vengeance for you.  And deliuering the Letters sealed vp to one of her seruants; Goe, saith she, and will, in my name, one of the Vshers of the priuy Chamber, to deliuer these Letters presently to the King; for he commanded mee to send them with all possible speede vnto him. Hauing dismissed the Messenger, being now furiously intended of her death, she hastened, and yet often stucke at it; sometimes tempting it like a mad woman, then again in milder language of griefe vrging her constancy. By chance, a certaine Maid heard all her words from the next inner roome, which had a doore out of her chamber; Selenissa had neither seene her, nor durst she speake or goe away, ashamed that she had heard her Mistris secrets: for shee beleeued not, that her desperate words would haue had so franticke an end; and therefore stayed but vntill her Mistris should goe forth, and shee would steale out secretly after her. But Selenissa assuring her selfe, that all the praise in a voluntary death, was in the speedy doing of it, and that some would come presently fro the King, who would hinder her in the performance, openeth her Cabinet, in which did lye a short sword, which her husband had giuen to his sonne when he was a child, and euer since kept it, to dedicate to with his first swaddling clouts vpon his marriage day. Fortune had so decreed, that a little before, it had an edge put to it, by scowring off the rust: neither was there any other weapon in her Chamber, fitter to make a passage into her brest. But as soone as she tooke it vp, being mindfull of her Husband which was dead, and of her Sonne whom she left friendlesse; hauing also so many seuerall phantasies in her mind, she kist the deadly hilt, and speaking to it, she did for some time deferre her purposed death; vntill the Maid, which began now to feare lest this should proue a true Tragedy, leapt out to wrest the sword from her: and at the same instant, came in they whom the King had sent to her. Then the old woman, mooued with the hastinesse of those that came to hinder, and as yet hauing her hands at liberty, stabbed her selfe so deepe into the bowels, that her spirit suddenly fayling, loosened her right hand, and her brest falling on the ground, buried the weapon vp to the hilts in the wound. The Maid cryed out aloud, and embracing her dying Mistris, with a most terrible howling, affrighted those, who were already dismayed. For followed; Meleander importuning them, when first hee receiued those Funerall Letters, that they should make haste to that wretched woman, and preuent her death. Evrymedes , as hee was commanded, putting aside the Maid, embraced Selenissa , looking ghastly, with eyes standing in her head: What wicked act is this, saith hee, old Matrone? Why doe you goe to vndoe your selfe and yours? She said nothing, but once lifting vp her eyes, and casting downe her necke, she gaue vp the ghost. They were all awhile silent, and then againe variously muttered, and presently the report spreading farther, the fearefull act drew many of the Nobles to view the spectacle. Afterwards, there were sundry, and sometimes dangerous coniectures of the secret cause of her act. But the King hearing of her murder, was exceedingly troubled: and no signes, either of pitty or hatred, did change Argenis ; whether shee beleeued that shee had not punishment yet sufficient of Selenissa , or rather fretting in her mind, wondred that she could be pacified with the greatnesse of her repentance; and stood amazed betweene two so neere passions. Againe, she considered how much Selenissa had wronged her in her death. What would Sicily thinke? What would notable reuenge vpon her selfe, had diuulged that secresie of Theocrine , much more then by the fault of her discouery. Besides, seeing the businesse was so farre gone, she hoped the King should now haue heard from Selenissa , of her contract with Poliarchvs ; which secret she her selfe could not tell her Father, yet intended stoutly to defend it, if it had beene reuealed. But the King commanding the people to be kept backe, the body was then buryed without any solemnity; and after the cause of her death was openly found out; I know not what Poet made these Verses.  Stranger, this Tombe, griefes monument, you see: Twice dyes shee, whom her selfe condemnes to dye. Speake not such words as may her ghost affright, Nor such as make the gentle earth seeme light; 'Twere wickednesse to blesse or curse this graue? But say, As thou deseruest, mayst thou haue. 'Tis Selenissa: whether more amisse She broke faith, or reueng'd it, doubtfull 'tis. what to doe with Radirobanes , what with the Herald, and with the Letters; he calleth some of the chiefe Councellours to him; he sheweth to them how all his affaires are beset with cares; how Radirobanes doth opprobriously taxe him vpon his honour, who also doth not so much demand as command three hundred Talents for his Soldiers pay that he brought to our ayde: that hee would reuenge himselfe by strength of Armes, if Sicily had not wasted his forces by ciuill broyles, and left Radirobanes, for his good turne, leisure now to repent of his ill; that he did chafe to haue beene so forgetfull of himselfe, and to haue strengthened yesterdaies suspition with improuident rage. When he had plentifully discoursed of these things, yet hee had a great care, not to mention how Argenis credit was questioned by her enemy: now that he imagined but that all would bee discouered: neuerthelesse he had a respect to his Daughters modesty being then present, and warned others by his owne quietnes, that no body should trouble her heereafter with the memory of so foule a slander; they might notwithstanding know, that their counsell was sought vpon an important businesse: Hee told them, how Selenissa had most faithlesly disclosed to Radirobanes , certaine secrets belonging to the King, which, though they were not hurtfull in themselues, he had falsified in his owne mis-conceit: that he had rayled in a most spitefull language, in his Letters which he writ: that Selenissa , in respect of Radirobanes , was innocent, who thought neuertheles, her sin was only to be purged by death. It was all their opinions, that Radirobanes should be taken for an open enemy to Sicily : what ayde soeuer he had brought, it was not out of any good will, but as a Robber to haue tarryed in the Iland for some Treason; being willing that Lycogenes should be made away, that he might haue effected what the other intended. There was a more doubtfull question concerning the Herald, some iudging him to be hanged; others, that he should be sent backe to Radirobanes dismembred: yet the opinion of Cleobvlvs preuailed; that by no meanes they should wrong the Herald, and, may be, the Sardinian King would be very glad to haue him ill dealt with: that the proud King would be more incensed at the contempt, then by the fellows punishment. Which after the King allowed of, Evrymedes calling the Herald to him, (for they would not bring him backe to Meleanders sight) of purpose spake to him in this maner: If thou hadst brought so sawcie a Letter from a King that had beene in his right wits, thou hadst not liued to this houre: but now we pardon thy Masters madnes, to whom thou shalt tell in the King Meleanders name, that it is not fit to answere mad men: and that hee should doe well hereafter, not to write to Kings, before his braynes were settled. After the Herald departed, Arsidas presently had a great Garison of Soldiers to defend the Hauen. Timonides gathered the Sea-forces into the Ships; that if Radirobanes would offer any further violence then words, they might be able by force to repell him. Neither were they now disquieted in the Court onely, but in the Towne also, as if the warre were to bee renewed. And now Radirobanes began to feare, not onely lest his Herald had suffered death for the sawcinesse of his Letters, but also, lest the forces of Sicily should addresse themselues against his Nauy; his anger waxed hote, and the inconueniences of warre now came into his minde, which too much heat had before suppressed; his Army was too weake for the power of all Sicily ; the Coast was guarded; he wanted prouision at Sea. Notwithstanding, if he were now vrged, his stay would be dishonourable, especially when hee had offered the first occasion. While he considereth these things, and looketh backe towards the shore, he might perceiue a Boat comming out of the Hauen; that was it which brought backe the Herald: hee, not yet free from feares, relates what Evrymedes had said, aggrauating the violence of the speaker, and the vprore in the Court; the cause whereof hee could not vnderstand: for when Selenissa had killed her selfe, and there was euery-where a great muttering; Cleobvlvs put a Guard vpon the Herald, that he might not meet any to inquire or know of this occasion. depart, before hee should be forced to fight or flye: for should he rather shew his anger against himselfe, then against his enemy, by vnseasonable attempts: Hee had already more then enough vented his rash fury: hee would rather carry backe his forces to Calaris , (that was the chiefe City of Sardinia at that time) and renewing his Army, inuade Sicily on the sudden with fresh supplyes. And yet hee thought it not expedient presently to returne; for hee both knew, that the Sea-forces which Meleander had in the Hauen, were but weake, and it would aske some time, before greater forces could be sent for from Lilib aeum and Panormus . Hee spent therefore the rest of the day in the Rode. In the twy-light, when the winde did blow a fauourable gale, hee commanded them to weigh Anchors, and to bend their course for Sardinia ; and that his departure might not seeme fearefull, or by stealth, hee gaue order that the Mariners should double their shouts and cryes, whether they did groane with weighing Anchors, or else did helpe one the other, to dispose of the rest of the munition and warlike furniture. The cryes also of Souldiers calling vpon their absent Countrey, and praying to the Sea-gods, were carryed to the shore. in a readinesse, and the Hauen, and adioyning Coast, to haue a strong Garrison: for hee would not haue his Ships passe out of the Hauen to the fight, that they might be back't by those Land-forces, wherein hee was strongest, and the Sardinians might fall vnder double forces at once. Yet the nearenesse of the night had increased his trouble and feare. But the Enemies being carryed into the Maine with a fauourable winde, first ceased to bee heard, and then to be seene; for the Cloudes had obscured the beginning of the night. But lest their departure might be feigned, and they afterwards returne on them vnawares, many not onely of the Souldiers, but of the Nobility also, watcht about the Hauen. Amongst them, Nicopompvs , when in the depth of the night, the noyse was stiller, tooke the benefit of their silence, and his owne watchfulnesse, and by the fauour of the night, giueth his minde freedome for some few lines, in which hee bequeatheth the Sardinians to stormes and tempests.  Go, treacherous Ships: your sayles all tempests driue: Such faith to you let windes and water giue, As you deserue. Enyo shall attend With frightfull hayre; and kindling with her brand The Clouds, bring Stygian lightning on your Fleet: And you at Sea, the vengefull God shall meet Scarce sparing good men: windes and tempests store Are here: our Seas with rapid Monsters rore. Here threatning Scylla does with barkings feare The ecchoing waters: rough Charybdis there, Does her deuouring iawes for prey prepare, Thither let whirle-windes beare yee, or tempests teare Rockes from the Land, which you on Sea do meet: Such once was Dele , not yet Apollo's seat Floating: or neere the Thracian Bosphorus , Cyanean Iles, to Sea-men dangerous. O Man vnworthy of thy Scepter sent Sardinia's King, by Starres maleuolent; See what small space keepes from the greedy Sea Thy life; from which, no armes, no force can free. The valiant and the fearefull, in like state The stormes will tosse: all in the hand of Fate, And of the gods thou art: and when anon Thy Ships shall float the rugged waues vpon Tost vp and downe; the waues parting away, Shall seeme their dreadfull bottomes to display; What ayd inuok'st thou? To what Deity Wilt thou, vnvs'd to prayer, bootlesse cry? The gods will not becoz'ned; nor thy feare Excuse thee: but the Windes away shall beare Thy prayers; or loud stormes the noyse shall drowne: The gods heare those that to themselues are knowne.  A discourse of Evrymedes his counselling the King to keepe still his Army afoot, the better to maintaine peace. The answer of Dvnalbivs to this aduice: How it was fit the King should fortifie Sicily .  guarded. Now, two dayes being scant past, the Scowts brought back word, that they were all gone for Sardinia . But then hee began to consult, not as though the warre had beene ended, but the danger onely deferred, how they might defend Sicily , and reuenge themselues vpon the Enemy, which, out of all question, would returne. It was long since that Evrymedes , a man of great spirit and martiall knowledge, had admonished the King, that he could not settle his Kingdome in greater security, then to haue an Army alwayes ready and prepared in his Garrisons; and then when Fortune did seeme to commend the benefit of his aduice, Meleander walking betweene himselfe and Dvnalbivs , and debating of disposing the Garrisons in conuenient places, about the Sea-townes, against the Sardinians , he spake to this purpose: If you had done as I aduised in the beginning against the dead had beene in readinesse with ease to haue opposed him. But if you now sit idle, though hee be expelled, Fortune will finde others, which will neyther suffer you to lay downe your suspicion, nor to take Armes. Rayse (I say) an Army which may keepe your Enemies in awe, and may be certaine in peace and warre. The feare hereof will keepe your Subiects in obedience, and will both strengthen the ancient confederation and amity of Strangers, and also finde out new friends: For ciuill dissentions, eyther by the ambition, or conspiracy of some few of the Nobility, doe creepe in, or, which is more rare, accrue by the vnanimity of the vnruly vulgar. But there is nothing more profitable or wholesome for both these diseases of the Common-wealth, then to haue such forces alwayes in readinesse: for the factions of the Nobility in their first birth and infancy, are faint-hearted and weake; that if the Souldiers be in a readinesse and furnished, the mischiefe may be supprest with honour; and truely, these Fountaines may be drawne dry as it were by a forcible and thirsty lightning, which if you suffer, they will quickly ouer-flow the bankes. But if the rage of the common people, in a generall reuolt (which is to be feared by wise men, because it hath happened to your Ancestors heretofore) shall take Armes against their King; there is no remedy against their fury, except you oppose to this Monster of many heads, firme  & well- disciplined bands of Souldiers: for the multitude powerfull in their onely violence, how much soeuer they may fill the Field with great numbers, yet they shall not be sufficient to match those, who know how to auoyd these outragious enemies, to keepe their rankes, follow their Leaders, and chuse the opportunity of fight and defence. So, vpon all sides, Garrison-Souldiers are most profitable for the defence of the Kingdome, and for the preuenting or suppressing outrages, which are not to bee look't after, and trayned on the sudden, but doe wait for the Enemy, being euer in pay. These forces, whithersoeuer you shall turne, shall preserue you in safety. And if any of the fenced Cities or Castles shall fall from your alleagiance, by the sedition of the people, or reuolt of the Nobility, they shall presently extinguish this fresh, and as yet doubtfull Treason. But how much will forreine Countries honour you, when you shall haue these forces in readinesse and at your becke? They will thinke that they inioy peace by your permission, who cannot be indammaged or neglected. You shall sit as a Iudge ouer other Kings, who haue not the like forces in a readinesse. It hath been known, that our Countrey hath been renowned, as by its owne disposition ready and fit for warre. How much the rather, if they haue the helpe of exercise to nature, and that your Enemies may know, that you haue a choyce company, not of young nouices, but of old experienced Souldiers? Neyther will this adde onely to your glory: They shall make tryall by the euent, who shall prouoke you, what difference it is to bring an Army into the Field of fresh-water Souldiers, and of military men, who can as well tell their age by their pay, as by the Calender. Or doe you thinke that Souldiers newly taken into pay, will fight with that confidence and spirit, with which they, who for ancient loue, more like houshold seruants then Souldiers, will defend their Prince, who hath alwayes vsed to giue them food and liuelihood, and to whom warre hath not onely ioyned them, but the fortune of their whole life? I cannot omit, as all other bodies, so warre doth consist by the strength and vigor of the limmes; and onely experience teacheth vs, who is fit for this seruice. Some want health, others spirit, which defects, their habit of body, and outward appearance doe so cloake, that nothing but experience can discouer. Therefore in this perpetuall exercise of Armes, and, as I may call it, in this warlike peace, betimes, and without danger, these vices will discouer themselues, which presently shal be purged from the body of the army, either by correcting their faults by discipline, or else by discharging them. But in raysing sudden forces, when Garrisons are to be filled, and when you put Armes vpon Strangers without experience, you often know not whether you intertaine a man or an image; that I may thinke a new Army to differ as much from a tryed one, as a Ship which is built of approued good plankes and stuffe, from one which is made of vnseasonable cut Timber, or of seuerall Woods, without regard had to their different faults. But there is a regard to be had of the charge. It is a burden some thing for so many Captaines, and so many Souldiers to liue vpon other mens labours; a very worthy care wee take, that our Enemy, when hee conquers vs, may finde our Houses well fraught and full of riches. Let vs call to minde the desolations, the wasting of the treasure, and miseries which we haue suffered by ciuill dissention: Hath not the fury of a few moneths, wasted the pay for many yeeres, of as many Souldiers as might haue preuented those calamities? Adde further, the violence offered to men and womens persons, the firing of Houses, and other enormities not punishable in such a commotion, and surely the Countrey at a cheape rate, may free themselues from these wrongs, by being at the yeerely charge of maintayning a Garrison. nature and education to gouerne a Common-wealth. Whilest therefore sometimes by way of consenting, and sometimes by modest tokens of his contrary opinion; and Meleander was very glad, that out of two different opinions, hee might gather what should be best on both sides. When Evrymedes therefore had scant ended, Dvnalbivs , by the Kings command, began in this manner: Except Evrymedes should iudge of others by his owne fidelity, he would neuer haue attributed so much to Souldiers, that hee should place the safety of the King and Countrey, not onely in the vse of them, but, as it were, in the very shaddow of their strength; although my Robes and order of Priesthood haue exempted mee from warlike imployment, yet because the question heere is, not what hurt warres doe in the World, but whether they can any way helpe to the settling of peace, I will not spare to speake what I thinke. But I not so much oppose your opinion, Evrymedes , as I aske your aduice of those things in which I am ignorant and doubt: they neuer are pleasing to mee, who giue physicke to a sound body for diseases that may come hereafter, and doe waken the cause of diseases now asleepe, and in no time worse wakened, then vpon such an occasion; how many sicknesses and deaths of men doe wee see, in stirring vp by such physicke, humours now quieted, and as it were hauing forgotten to hurt? But I thinke them like to these, who in a quiet time doe seeke dangerous remedies against future troubles, and which by the doubtfull euent, can as well destroy as preserue the true safety of the Weale-publique. I therefore place these troupes of armed Souldiers amongst these vncertaine, and for the most part, remedies of danger: for, if Souldiers shall once muster themselues in Armes, if pride or fury shall cast off the band of allegeance, these policies of peace, and opinion of Captaines, will finde themselues much deceyued, who had raysed these Forces, intending thereby to preuent commotion. You know what a strong body, bands, and troupes of foot and horse, vnder Captaines and Coronels, doe make; yet they can hardly eyther know their owne strength, or fall into pride and arrogancy, which the consideration thereof doth put in their minde; while the Enemy takes away their ease, and they haue some body whom they may prouoke or feare. But when by their strength they haue made peace, and no body hindereth the memory of the victory by new danger, then they consider with themselues, how powerfull their strength was; that they may vpbraid their paynes to their King or Countrey; that they onely brought home securitie to their Countrey-men; that the fate of their King and Countrey lay vpon their shoulders. These thoughts doe not meet presently, and at one time, but by little and little, by time, familiarity, and custome. They hang together, as if they would make a different Common-wealth from the rest: then they grow wanton with ease, which how much it diminisheth of their courage, so much it addeth to their sawcy pride: for presently, if they thinke themselues not truely rewarded; if they are not dayly obserued, they grow insolent, they fume, and disdayne that their strength is not feared. What, when they are sollicited by their Captaines, and factious great Oness what, where a thought of greater pay, of booty, sedition, and freedome of offending, possesse their mindes? The gods turne this mischiefe on our Enemies: for I could not thinke, as you did say, Evrymedes , that the King should be most respected of them, because they haue their pay from his Treasury; their Gouernours are better beloued of them, both because they are chosen into the band by them, (as if for this cause it were not the Kings hyre, but of their gift;) as also, because they loue Officers of their owne body, and defenders of the Military power: but especially, because there is a more dissolute discipline of warre offered to them vnder these, then vnder their King. But whether will you appoynt one Deputy, or seuerall Gouernours ouer each Company, in all the Garrisons in the time of peace? If you will make seuerall Offices, their discipline will be variable, their Leaders will suspiciously contend among themselues, and, by their dissention, the Army will vtterly grow at oddes. But if you should put that trust in one; what is hee, into whose hands you would giue such power ouer your selfe? Both your Reigne and Life will bee at his mercy. Moreouer, when hee shall finde himselfe to hold the reynes of rule and power, can his integritie bee proofe against such temptations as will then inuade him, and proudly tell him what hee can doe. But I would they were alwayes like to your Evrymedes , to whom Princes deliuer vp their fortunes and power; although I should imagine that hee would not vndergoe so enuious a dignity; you know, in what Land, the like custome heretofore hath taken from our Kings their Scepters, who, while they deliuer vp all their Forts of strength to their Presidents, by little  & little haue beene wiped of all power, both ouer their Subiects and Souldiers. These two grounds are especially to be obserued, by those who labour to establish or containe a Kingdome. First, that the people may not be able to make head against their Prince: then, if they would fall from their alleageance, that they should not haue fitting Leaders, to support their loose and vnseasonable fury, by better temper, and bands of discipline. Wee doe destroy both these remedies, by the aduice of these settled and perpetuall Garrisons: for what will these bands of Souldiers, these men of all conditions, to whom we doe voluntarily giue our defence, differ from the common people? What commotions soeuer may fall among the common people, may fall more dangerously among them. And so much the more ready, because being offended, the first thing they looke after, is their power, which makes them confident. But now no fortune will offer a Leader more ready or free to turbulent dispositions, then this very same Gouernour, whom you shall place in authority ouer your Garrisons: for who almost hath a faithfull resolution left, hauing so many inticements to proue false? a minde knowing his owne power, and tasting the sweetnesse of Princely greatnesse, the wishes of flatterers, and himselfe incompassed with able men, are manifold meanes to hide his fault; and if things happen not according to their wishes, yet their boldnesse is excusable, by the fault of the multitude; and before his party be vanquished, hee will looke for equall conditions from the King, as yet doubting to whom the victory may fall. Notwithstanding, suppose this great Lieutenant, eyther by nature, or his owne worth, doth hate Treason, and, resolute in his vertue, will not be drawne from his duetie; what will so many Captaines vnder him? Is none of them Coward, head-strong, false? Is none of them too popular amongst his Souldiers, by the report of his valour and prowesse? Leaue off vaine hopes; there will neuer be one wanting to be Leader in such a businesse. But yet these things which are inconuenient in our coniecture, are to be feared, if all the Army should be resident in one place of strength; Yet you would preuent this storme, and disperse this great body into seuerall parts; that beeing placed vnder one view, they should not admire their owne power, nor grow insolent by the infection of their owne stirring mindes. Whither then would you dispose of them being diuided? should they bee bestowed into Castles and Townes? Consider further on both sides, how commodious that may be. As I know, Fortresses are to be kept by a fitting Guard; so they are not able to intertaine so great a company of Souldiers in them; and they become lesse safe by the continuall entercourse of so many eyes, and such a multitude: for, will you haue so many Souldiers buryed there, as it were in a prison? Will not their friends goe to them? Will not their wiues, kindred, drudges, and slaues? But you will rather send your forces into Townes, as to perpetuall wintering places. You know not what disagreement there may be betweene the Souldiers, and the rest of the people. Would you put that vpon vnarmed Citizens, who would follow their Trades in peace, with a perpetuall loathing, which is most tedious to them in warre; that they must regard Strangers and Souldiers in their owne Houses; and their Streets and Churches ring with Souldiers rude behauiours, and their very Houses must change their quiet fashions? All will complaine of the burden, and all mens mindes fall from you. And when they shall reuolt, how small an addition will they thinke it to their discommodity, who suffer enough already, to pay money and maintenance? Neyther will there bee such profit in a deuided Army, as Evrymedes did shew. For military Discipline cannot be obserued within a Towne, nor Nouices taught and trayned in that time of peace; and the old Souldiers themselues will lye in the Townes, surfetting with idlenesse and slouth; and neglecting their dueties, will imploy themselues onely on their priuate businesse, and houshold affaires: and being accustomed to receiue pay, without paynes-taking, are harder drawne from their wonted ease to danger, then if you should take vp fresh men, and such who would know that they were not to liue on the Kings pay, but in warre, and time of need. When Evrymedes had answered to these Arguments of Dvnalbivs , and hee againe had replyed for himselfe, Meleander did thus reconcile them, by allowing those things which each of them praysed in a different opinion: That excessiue troupes were dangerous. Yet besides the Garrisons which did lye in necessary places, there must be a care of the Nauy, and the Coast of Sicily to be kept with twenty Gallies: whereof some should still keepe the Seas, and the rest wait the Kings pleasure in the Hauens: That many Officers shall bee appoynted for them; some of them of the chiefe of the able Youth, others of those which had already serued. These should be mustered to eight thousand; halfe the troupes should alwayes follow the King; that the Companies should spend halfe the yeere at home, the other part in Garrison: for so they shall not be able to make a forcible insurrection being diuided, neyther by a long and idle lazinesse at home to forget their discipline. They which shall attend the King, shall not lodge all together. Euery thousand by themselues shall eyther be encamped, or lodged in the Villages adioyning to the Towne where the King is: for those Citizens which gaine by the Court, by lodging or dyet, should not thinke it troublesome, if they should receiue some of these Souldiers into their Houses. Let them haue large and ample pay, and a stricter Law of obedience; let them be seuerely punished for theft, wantonnesse, and loose behauiour. And, that they should not grow worse by idlenesse, they may be kept in Military exercise; sometimes for a wager by shooting or tossing a Pike before the Captaines; sometimes being commanded a March in their Armes, that they should not feare an expedition against their Enemies to be tedious. There shall be no Captaine, no Leader, no Officers, but whom the King himselfe chuses. There should be two thousand Horse the rest proportioned for Iauelins, Lance, and Speare, as need shall require. They were of opinion, that with these forces suddaine commotions might bee supprest, and if need should require greater strength, that fresh Companies might be trayned. Evrymedes affirmed, that hee would haue prescribed no greater a company, nor Sardinians and them, all thought to adde to these numbers. other businesse; aboue all things hee was carefull of Argenis ; shee was innocent, and in whom, besides her excellencies, there was no fault, yet shee was the cause of all these troubles. Lycogenes attempting all disloyalty, that he might compasse her for his Wife, was not easily, nor without a bloudy warre suppressed. Radirobanes had followed him in his violent desire, but as yet with a doubtfull successe. Neyther did he thinke, that there would be yet wanting those, whom the much-admired Lady, hauing a Kingdome for her Dowry, would not set on fire; excepting this happinesse bestowed vpon some one, quieted the desires of all others. Neyther did the death of Selenissa , nor the concealement of Theocrine , a little trouble his disquiet thoughts. At length, he did fully determine to marry his Daughter; thinking That, the onely remedy to pacifie so many troubles. And now thinking not onely vpon a Sonne-in-law, but also vpon issue by them, hee was exceedingly delighted with the very thought thereof. But of whom should hee make choyce answerable to her? There were no Neighbour-Princes about him which were marriageable. But is it necessary, quoth hee, to finde out for her a King, or a Crowne? as if Kingdomes, not Princes themselues were ioyn'd in marriage, or I must of necessity finde another Kingdome for my Daughter, not a Husband? And truely our Ancestors made this Law wisely, That no King or Queene that gouerned Sicily , should ioyne a Kingdome by marriage to it, which should be stronger or richer; left the Countrey being forsaken by their Kings, they should fall vnder the subiection of a more potent Kingdome. Sicily is sufficient for her selfe, that shee may breed her owne Princes: and I shall well prouide for my Daughter, if I giue her in marriage to such a one as shall confesse he owes all his fortune to her. It is the custome of the Thracians to buy Wiues: let Nobility, Worth, and Vertue be in her Husband, my  hee declareth his designe: hee telleth his Daughter what Husband he had chosen for her. Argenis asketh two moneths to deliberate of this marriage: She lamenteth her misfortune.  his thoughts, as willing to make his deare Archombrotvs his Heire by this Marriage: Neyther did he beleeue that Argenis would dislike it: but if she seemed vnwilling, he would force her to obedience, by laying his fatherly command on her. Now there remayned nothing, but to know his birth: for, although he had many deseruing parts in him, yet hee was vnwilling to bestow his Daughter vpon a man altogether vnknowne. Hauing duely considered of all things, hee goeth to Argenis her Closet, and that he might the easier obtaine what hee desired, shewing himselfe betweene a Father and a King; I know, Daughter, (saith hee) that Sicily doth no lesse complaine of the slownesse of our proceedings, than wee at their seditious commotions: For, the desire of a Kingdome, and the hope of thy marriage, did driue Lycogenes and Radirobanes to these vexations, which of late we tasted; all which we might haue preuented, if we had chosen a Husband for thee sooner. Why doe we not stop the fountaine of these miseries? I haue purposed to prepare safety for thy youth, and a prop for my old age. Neither doe I doubt, but I shall doe that with thy free will, which by my owne authority I haue power to doe. Wilt thou not suffer thy Father ( Argenis ) to chuse thee a Husband? By the right both of a King and a Father, I may doe this; neither will it fit thy modesty to withstand it. Then the fearefull Lady answered, that she would consider. But will you consider, quoth the King, whether you will doe your duty? You haue had sufficient leisure already. I aske you once more, my Daughter, whether you will be at my command? faigned gesture, that shee would obey his will. Meleander praised her dutifull affection, and kissing her, said; Thou knowest how much I loue thee; my life is not dearer to mee then thou art. Thou dost well, in putting trust in an old man, and thy Father. The next day, as he was walking by chance in the Garden, he calleth aside Stranger, I should aske you of your birth, you might suspect my inquisitiue demand: but being a friend, sith I haue endured a long time to bee ignorant of your lynage, and now desire to know, why should you not thinke me to doe it, as much for your sake, as mine owne? I haue businesse of importance, which I thinke, will not be vnpleasing to you to treat with you, if once I were satisfied concerning your parentage. You may very well know what trust I did put in you being a Stranger; the very secrets of my Kingdome were knowne to you, neither did your age or being a Stranger, hinder that I should not commit all things to your trust; and all indeed was of your desert: for ouerpassing other things, I cannot forget how you did saue mee from drowning, being indangered your selfe; and how you slew Lycogenes and after mutuall courtesies, why are you loth to let me know your parentage? which, as the gods shall helpe, I now desire to know for your good preferment. These perswasions of Meleander , much perplexed the Young-man: What should be the reason, he should so earnestly desire to know that, which hee himselfe could hardly endure to haue beene so long concealed? Or what kind of courtesie it should bee, that he could not bestow vpon him being a Stranger? Presently he conceiued the marriage of Argenis , because his thoughts did much hammer on it, with a most delightfull imagination: then againe labouring to shake off that hope, as vaine and arrogant: being better settled in words than in mind, he answers; In this, great King, you haue doubled your fauours to mee, in suffering him to be your seruant, whom you did not know. Neither doe I yet know, what pleasure it will doe you to make mee wicked; that is , to make me vndutifull to my parents, who did strictly charge mee to conceale my birth: yet, that you may not condemne mee of a froward disposition, as farre as it shall be lawfull, I will vnfold all things, hiding the names of my Countrey and parents. My descent is Royall, and my Countrey at peace: neither came I hither by compulsion, or for any dislike at home, but by the command of my parents, to bee an eye-witnesse of the renowne of your Court, and honourable vertues. The King, moued with new ioy, imbraced him as he was speaking, and said, I pray you, how haue you liked Sicily hitherto? How doe you like my Court? Or, that I may truely diue into your thoughts, how doth my old age please you, or the carriage of my Daughter? Whereupon he now neerer to his hope, answered, that he honoured them all. Then (quoth the King) I will purchase thee at no lesse rate. I let passe the vanquished Lycogenes , and my preseruation; there is yet something of more strength, that tyes my loue to you; your behauiour is honourable, your conuersation most pleasing, and especially I thinke you loue mee. I will neuer suffer you to part from mee. If, as you told mee, and I coniecture, you are of Princely birth, I will freely bestowe although you were of neuer so great parentage, you need not be ashamed of your Wife. It remaineth now, that you relate more freely to mee your fortunes, and promise mee, neuer to forsake my white hayres. offered to him, which hee had so much laboured for, doubtfull whether hee should thanke the gods or the King for this benefit, he casts himselfe downe at Meleander's feet, and held them, whether hee would or no. And when he could make no end of giuing thanks, Meleander being more pleasant, and taking delight in the others ioy, fell vpon his necke. All the beholders were strooken with admiration, what strange expression of loue this should be. But the King charged Archombrotvs , that he should not bruite it that day; and returning to the rest, hee spent some time freer in his discourse then vsually. Then going into the Palace, and Archombrotvs close by his side, How long (quoth hee) wilt thou suffer thy selfe to be vnknowne, and deferre our ioy? Sir, said hee, of this very thing I thought to haue asked your Maiestie; I desire two moneths space, within which I may relate my happinesse to my friends, and returne from thence according to my state and birth. The speech of his departure offended Meleander . I will not suffer you, our Alliance, and little regard vs, because we first profest our loue. If you like our choyce, write into your Countrey, for now I will not trust you to the Seas and Fortune. Archombrotvs being aduertised by the great affection of the old Prince, what he was to doe, and how much he should loue, kissing his Kingly hand, answered, that he would obserue him in all his commands. As yet the King had not made knowne to Argenis , what Husband he had chosen for her. When Archombrotvs therefore was departed, he calleth her to him, and relating what he had first spoken concerning the necessity of her marriage, he farther telleth her, that he had chosen a Sonne-in-law, whom he thought hee could not mend in his wishes, of Princely parentage, and answerable vertues; to conclude, it was That Archombrotvs , to whom, in token of these Alliances, the Destinies had giuen the honour to saue the King from drowning, and victory ouer Lycogenes . rather to constraint and command, than aduice. Argenis dissembling, put on a pleasing countenance; and although it did trouble her to bee promised to a Stranger, and against her liking; yet, as if shee seemed to allow of her Fathers purpose, shee thus spake: There is nothing more to bee feared in this, than lest this sudden marriage, without the approbation and foreknowledge of some of your friends, should be ill thought off, and it should be reported, that Radirobanes was wrongfully thrust out, that you might shew your loue to Archombrotvs . There is need of some time, in which the strangenesse of this newes may be allayed, and Archombrotvs may be knowne to bee a Suitor, before he bee a Husband. This reason did not seeme to be reiected by purpose to hinder the marriage, he spake thus to try her: As wee must giue some place to report, so wee must not too much to Fortune. Bee it as thou wilt, Argenis : What time dost thinke is fitting? She refused to speake, as referring that to the Kings will, not her owne; and when her Father often pressed her; at length, against her will, as it were, setting downe the length of her life; As I see the matter stands, quoth she, two moneths will be sufficient. Then the King, almost assuring himselfe that she desired to gaine time, rather to satisfie her selfe, than report; yet that hee might not seeme too rough in all things; But will you, saith he, promise me, that the time expired, you will not oppose this intended marriage? I will, replyes shee; neither, if the gods assist mee, shall I offend you in all my life time in the least word. And she promised this the freer, because she hoped that liues: yet if he should not come, she considered her freedome in death, as desiring to liue no longer. But the King hoping better, conceiued her words, as by her Fathers command bridling her affection, which before had assailed her free thoughts. Speaking therefore kindly to her, now as Conquerour, and assured of his purpose, hee sent her away. But shee, moued with all these miseries, neuer thought her selfe more vnhappy, then in publike happinesse: for Lycogenes beeing vanquished, freed from that care, and Sicily scant fetcht breath, now greater and more speedy feares straitly pursue her from Archombrotvs ; who is so neere to wrong her by his happy successe, that shee could wish againe for my Countrie's? Doe the Fates therefore ease the miseries of Sicily , vpon no gentler tearmes, then that I should redeeme them by my owne breath? Must this pompe, this attire, this beauty, be the trimmings to offer mee a Sacrifice to Sicilies infernall gods? Shall I bee Hercvles his Macaria , or But Fortune shall not long make a mockery of mee: this tenth and terrible waue shall either end the storme, or bring to shore this weather-beaten Ship. The gods be my witnesse, how willingly I would now entertaine death; if I did not feare for thy sake, Poliarchvs ; and Selenissa had not taught by her death, how that also is a remedy against all wicked acts. Then she began carefully to consider, whether she should stay for Poliarchvs his comming, or hasten his presence by Letters. It was now more then a moneth since his departure, appointing to returne at three moneths end; and she thought it the part of a Louer, (such a one as she knew Poliarchvs to bee) rather to be better than his word, then to spend the whole stocke of his time. Yet she determined to write, and so with a fresh violence, she vttered words flowing of themselues.  thy selfe, what ayleth thee. For though thou art there in health, yet thou beginst heere to perish by my fate. Thou shalt vnderstand by my Letters, what a little remnant of life is left mee. Radirobanes , contrary to his Royall dignity, and the Lawes of Hospitality, attempting a most dishonest action, because I would not yeeld to him, plotted my rape. Feigning, I know not what sights, which should bee shewed vpon the shore, he drew mee with my Father thither. Wee were neere to bee carried away, when the mischieuous plot being discouered, wee betooke our selues into the Towne, and hee returned to his Fleete. Then being turned into fury, he was so bold to write Letters to my Father, scandalizing my reputation, as if I had him more free of my loue towards thee than was beseeming; because Selenissa had reuealed our familiar friendship: and this was the reason that this wicked Young-man did so reprochfully taunt mee. But my Father stood for mee and the truth; and hands. But hee in an vnlucky houre, if the gods be iust, is gone for Sardinia . I was happy in his departure, when my Father, (I dread to speake, lest you may begin to hate him. They bee the Destinies which crosse vs, rather be angry with them, Poliarchvs ) my Father, I say, commanded mee to loue disposition pleased him; and he must now be his Sonne-in-law. I durst not prouoke my Fathers anger, by vnseasonable denyall. It was sufficient, vnder a different pretence, to desire time in which thou mightst come to mee, or if thou stay, that it may be at my choyce to dye. Two moneths are allowed mee to consider of my marriage: if within the time limited thou com'st with forces, I will come to thee; if otherwise, we will try all meanes of escape. But if thou forsake mee, euen on my Wedding day, in my richest attire, and when my Father desireth my hand, to deliuer it to Archombrotvs , I will say it is consecrated to the infernall gods, and withall, will stab my selfe to the heart, with a short Dagger, which I will hide vnder my clothes. If this shall so happen, heare now then, Poliarchvs , my last requests: Thinke that it shall be griefe sufficient for him, that I shall make him seeme cruell at the ghastly spectacle of my death: thou maist determine of Archombrotvs as thou please: but if thou shalt suffer Radirobanes to liue vnreuenged, I will returne from the graue to admonish thee of thy duty. Take thy full reuenge on that faithlesse Radirobanes for his abominable villany: let this Robber pay a strict account for slandering mee; and let him feele by thy implacable wrath, how much he hath offended. I doe strictly charge thee to take this paines and this reuenge: and I bind thee to it by my last will and Testament: and when thou art sufficiently auenged, command my name to be cut vpon a Tombe-stone in thy owne Countrey, and both our misfortunes to be wrote in Marble, by which after-ages may approoue of our constancy, and blame our fortune. But, my deare Poliarchvs , abandon the sight of this Iland, except thou wilt loue my ashes, and lay the Vrne of thy beloued Spouse at thy heart: or else (which the gods grant) thou wilt bury it amongst thy Ancestors. If thou canst, preuent these mischiefes by thy returne; for danger admitteth no delay: if thou canst not, haue a care of my last Commands; and, that thou mayst loue me, liue. Argenis.   who vndertaketh to find out Poliarchvs, and deliuer her Letters to him.  trust she should comit this message; hauing no body whose aduice she could vse; because it did not seeme conuenient to make Timoclea priuy to a secresie of so great importance, being placed but two daies before in imployed so often in these secret messages, lest he being wearied by so many dangers, shuld begin to feare Meleander . Besides, his departure from the Iland could not be concealed. Yet she thought none more fit; especially because he was priuy to all the vowes by which she had obliged Poliarchvs to her. Calling him therefore to her, she thus began: If I did feare, memory of Selenissa who, I thinke, did account the sting of her treason to be more grieuous than death it selfe, because she desired it for a remedy. For thou must know (though my Father and I conceal'd it) how that old woman discouered to Radirobanes my secret acquaintance with Poliarchvs ; and afterwards being afflicted with terrour of conscience, she made her selfe away, as you did see, with her owne hands. But thou shalt receiue a greater reward, most true friend, for thy fidelity, if we liue, than she suffered punishmet for her falshood. The busines draweth towards an end; expect greater things from vs, than thy modesty can wel conceiue. But I haue Letters which are to be deliuered to Poliarchvs with speciall trust  & diligence; chuse thou me a faithfull messenger, to whom I may safely deliuer them. But I pray, if you can, chuse me such a one, of whose truth you haue had experience in some busines of moment. Arsidas paused not long, I know none (Lady) saith hee, more trusty than my selfe. Why doe you giue me leaue to depart so soone, before you haue better considered of my desert? I will performe whatsoeuer you shall command; neither shall Poliarchvs now liue in any part of the world, but I will find him out. of going out of the Iland. There is a place of Italy , replyed Arsidas , which they call Latium : fast by the shore is seated Antium , a Towne renowned for the Temple of Fortune, which is there held in high estimatio. I wil dissemble a pilgrimage to the goddesse; this colour of deuotion will not be suspected. But when I shal goe out of Sicily , how many excuses are there for a longer voyage? Businesse, a desire to see fashions, and vowes to other deities. Only command me, and, if you can, tell me which way I should direct my iourney. If thou art resolued (said Argenis ) to deserue these thanks, I intreat thee, that with all diligence, thou mak'st the best speed thou canst. Thou shalt find Poliarchvs either in his own Country, or else comming hither to vs. Thou shalt heare more of me now, than Selenissa did in all her time. In France there is a Riuer called Araris , it runneth into another Riuer, which is called the Rhone : Poliarchvs natiue Countrey  & Kingdome reacheth from the head of their springs, till they pay their tribute to the Sea. His Father doth now enioy that Countrey, and he being his only Sonne, shall succeed him. Obserue to what a man you doe this fauour. If therefore, as I suppose, he be in his own Countrey, feare not, you shall quickly heare of him; for the very dumbe wals will direct you to the Prince. But doe thou presently perswade him, as I haue in my Letters, that he would performe his promise by his speedy returne; and that he should come backe now secured not only by his owne valour, but the strength of his Kingdome. But for my sake, visit the Temple of Fortune at Antium , (for by that coast you must goe) and aske aduice of the goddesse, concerning your iourney, and my tedious expectation: and withall, take this Ring, which as often as you shall see on your finger, remember that the safety of my selfe and the French Prince depend vpon your speede. And as she spake, she gaue him a Ring of great value, and withall, the Letters to Poliarchvs . But he being more cheerefull at the hearing of Poliarchvs his Princely fortune, yet began to wonder, that this marriage should be laboured by so many difficulties, as if it were so vnfit a match; vntill, by the words of the Sicilian Princes to be matched to any Kingdome greater than their own. And it was well knowne, that Meleander was not only most constant in obseruing the Lawes of his Countrey, but also exceedingly extolled this ordinance amongst the rest. But then Arsidas commended the wisdome of the Lady, who hitherto had not reuealed to her Father or his Councell, these their intentions, forbidden by the Law. And he knew that it concerned Poliarchvs to bring forces out of France , which being prepared, as it were, against  deuotions. His discourse with the Priest of Fortune. And the abuse of the people, concenring their beliefe in this goddesse.  disposition, and the falshood of Selenissa , he, the next day, which the gods turn'd to the best, set forward his iourney. The wind serued him well for Italy ; and there changing his Ship, lest he should be compelled to vse Sicilians and knowne Saylers in a businesse of that secresie, he coasted all along by the shore of Greece , and leauing Campania , he arriued at Antium . There was an ancient religious Temple on the Sea shore, which their Ancestors had dedicated to Fortune. After that Arsidas beheld it by the direction of the Inhabitants, in his secret prayers he commended himselfe to the goddesse, and fell downe on the shore: and as he was passing toward the Temple, the Priest met him in a white garment guarded about with purple: his gray haires hung about his shoulders,  & he wore a Garland of Bayes about his head, holding in his hand a staffe crowned with Lawrel. As soon as he saw to him: Whether you come as a stranger, hartily to desire any thing, or whether the goddesse hath deliuered you from danger which you feared, or you addresse your selfe with a deuotion deseruing farther fauour, come before the gentle goddesse,  & appease her either with lawfull sacrifice, or, if you had rather, Incense. Arsidas replied, Because, Father, that garment declareth you to be Priest to this goddesse, shew mee, I pray, with what Ceremony I may purge my selfe,  & what sacrifice I must offer before I pray to her, to be fauourable to my enterprise, lest I offend in point of religion to her, or whether she will admit of a Suppliant in this strange habit: for I will sacrifice to the goddesse; and my voyage, the wind now seruing, will not suffer any long stay. The Priest presently shewed him a Spring, which did runne by the Gates side; there must hee thrice wash his hands and eyes; and in the meane time made ready for him a Gowne and Crowne. There were beasts also for Sacrifices in the goddesse Court, which Strangers might buy, whether they would offer of greater or lesser price. Goe, Father, saith Arsidas , and chuse your selfe amongst these Sacrifices, which may be most acceptable to the goddesse Fortune: and withall, he puts gold into his hand: and while the Priest doth most seruiceably performe that religious duty, which was profitable to him, Spring; and then taking a short view of the Gates of the Temple, and the meaner Offerings which hung about them, hee cast his eye vpon an old Marble, which, not farre from the doore, offered these Verses to those that entred into the Temple:  Farre hence be all prophane; come not betwixt These sacred doores, whose heart on vice is fixt; Whose entrales Ennies poyson'd teeth doe gnaw; Or he, whose neuer-satisfied maw Deuoures poore people: or who-e're desires His Fathers death, or burnes with vnchaste fires: It bootes thee not, blind man, with humbled face, To kisse the ground, or on the Altar place Offrings and Garlands, vnlesse first thy heart Thou purge with penitent teares: from hence depart, Bad prayers; and, their blood God does not want. He with a word made all things, he gaue veynes, To feede with blood those bodies that containes Soules of all sorts: some wing'd i'th Ayre doe fly; Some, of a heauier mould, keepe earth, and lye In Fields, Woods, Houses: some, quite wanting ayre, To Mansions vnder water doe repaire. The Idumaean Balme, the Cynnamon Tree, The Frankincense, that growes in Araby , The same god made from seuerall saps to grow, And did on them their heauenly scent bestow. Why boast'st thou then of liberality, If aromaticke Canes of Araby Thou offer him, slay Cattell, or for loue Bestow thy gold? Thinke not, that thou to Iove Canst sell his owne goods at so deare a rate, Or with such smoke thy vices expiate. And now the Priest was come forth with the Sacrifices, and Arsidas hauing a Crowne on his head, in a white garment prostrated before the Altar of the goddesse, offered his vowes, and whatsoeuer Argenis had commanded him. A sucking Calfe, and two twinne Lambes, pleased the Priest for their offerings. He cut off the head of the Calfe without much paine, and sticked the Lambes with a knife, as a more gentle death; that the head might serue for the next dayes dinner. The Priest cryed alowd, that the entrales promised all good successe: and after he had beene with the Oracle, hee answered, that Fortune granted whatsoeuer Arsidas had demanded. And afterwards they boyled for themselues, what they had sacrificed to the goddesse. Now while they were at their banquet, and his company drinking more freely, rule of Fortune ouer the world, because hee had vnderstood by certaine speeches, that hee was a Philosopher. And perceiuing that Arsidas was learned, and worthy deeper discourse of Religion, he began thus to speake: The common people are so ignorant, worthy Stranger, what that is which we worship vnder the name of Fortune, that they haue almost corrupted, by a contrary interpretation this holy mystery. They call Fortune whatsoeuer is doubtfull; and That they will haue doubtfull, whose euents are not knowne to men. And for this cause they feigne her a mutable and a blinde goddesse: laying a greater aspersion vpon her whom they worship, than they would vpon a man: that it is oftentimes doubtfull, whether these mad people offer her reproach or Sacrifice. If they offend in any thing, if shee deceiue their expectation, forthwith they speake ill of Fortune. They cast in her teeth, that shee hath raised wicked men, and seemeth to haue no respect of the good, neither iudgeth rightly of any thing. Nor doe miserable men see, how that Fortune is no diuine thing, but a mockery of superstitious braynes, who, with superfluous care, feare and worship their owne inuentions: for that god-head which they make to themselues, either can or cannot dispose of all things which happen to mortall men; and wee may call things happening by chance, disposed according to the desire of him that prayeth. If she cannot, what therefore doth shee? Or from whence is this vnprofitable goddesse, who hath no rule in her owne Kingdome? Whether will you say, that she hath authority ouer mens estates, which cannot deiect them, cannot sustaine them, or change them; except perchance these changes of things, and, as it were, ouersight of nature, could not come to passe without this idle goddesse, to whom they leaue nothing, besides a name, and an ill opinion? To conclude, Why build we Temples to her? And why doe we aske counsell of the Oracle heere, when wee haue bound her to vs by the great expence of so many Sacrifices? It is a vaine deuotion, if wee spend thus, when there is no feare, no expectation. But if you thinke humane conditions to be disposed by her, which otherwise had fayled, and to be distributed according to the deuotion of the Suppliant; now then it is not Fortune, if you vnderstand, with the common people, by this name, that Deity which suffereth the state of man to be turned, not by aduice, but by casualty. That I may resolue you in a few words; you came to obtaine somewhat of Fortune; you haue worshipped her, you haue sacrificed to her: Whether doe you thinke that your businesse will fall out more prosperous, than if you had neglected the goddesse? If you thinke it will, then Fortune doth nothing vnaduisedly, who knoweth whom shee fauoureth, and doth not rashly fawne or frowne on any, but by desert; that is, she is not that Fortune which the people doe make her: but if you thinke these Sacrifices vnprofitable, why doe wee by vnnecessary labours, take paines to spend our needlesse deuotions at her Altars? But you will say, we come not to alter that Destiny, which is ordained to our enterprizes, but onely to vnderstand by the Oracle, what it is. If you thinke so, you doe ingeniously confesse, that Fortune doth know, wherein the gods will punish, and wherein they will bee fauourable to you. Vpon which will follow, that nothing doth happen in the world vnaduisedly or vnawares, and not fore-seene by the gods; which doth not agree to that Fortune, which the people thinke of. You see, worthy Stranger, how I haue dishonoured Fortune, not her which I worship, but which the ignorant people doe make, and which cannot possibly agree with that most absolute fore-knowledge that gouerneth all things by his owne order, which made nature, and the causes of all things, and by an vnknowne way giues them continuance. And because Mariners know not in the midd'st of a tempest, when the storme will cease, and when the winde will doth not therefore God know, whether in his secret Decree, hee hath ordayned whether the Ship shall be saued, or cast away? But that you should not say, We doe pray therefore in vaine to the gods; and if now all things are knowne to the gods which shall happen, that our prayers are in vaine to them to preuent those dangers, which shall fall vpon vs: Farre be this contumely from the gods, whose fauour no body doth gayne, by constrayned and vnthankefull labour; because Ivpiter , when hee first made the World, and gaue Lawes to Nature, when he disposed of the order of things, their causes and events, hee did also know, how deseruing you would be by your religious conuersation. These your prayers are not new to him which you doe now powre forth, but they were then knowne, when first in his secret counsell hee determined of the World, of mankinde, and your selfe. His Decrees therefore by this your piety are gentle, which hee had appoynted grieuous against you, if it had not beene for thy fore-seene prayers, and religious inclination. By the same reason, secure wicked men should not beleeue that they are not the cause of their owne punishment from the angry God: for the iust God had not appoynted these plagues, which hang ouer sinners, vnlesse the wickednesses which they now commit, had drawne his anger to them, to decree a future reuenge. But that power and knowledge of God which fore-seeth all things that are to come, and clearely apprehendeth what-euer is vnknowne to vs, is that, which wee Philosophers doe worship vnder the name of Fortune, because those things seeme casuall to our blindnesse, though to him they are certaine, who fore- sees both his owne will and ours. As wee therefore call the wisdome of God, gouernement of those things which are hidden from vs, and fall not vnder our capacity, wee call Fortune. To this Fortune doe wee build a Temple, and adore her Image, that shee would teach vs things to come, and would make our future actions successefull, and accept of our prayers which we make for our safety. Which if wee doe with a religious heart, they are then auayleable, and did most helpe vs, when God gaue Nature the Originall and Law of all things and causes. This is the Fortune you must worship, worthy Stranger, and to this you must giue thankes for her benefits; I meane, to the great Ivpiter , which hath promised to thee happy successe, both by the Oracle, and Beasts entrales, of what before thou wert vncertaine: for, if I haue any faith in mee, your Sacrifice has good issue. Go in safety, go with confidence in Fortune, that is, the great God.  Queene Timandra being deliuered of a Sonne, names him Astioristes ; and sends him secretly to be educated.  the Priest for his paynes, and sage aduice, hee gaue him more money to buy other Beasts for Sacrifices, which should be offered the next day to the goddesse for their prosperous iourney: and the Priest leading him to the shore, he went on shipboord: and passing by Latium with a fauourable winde, hee reached the Etrurian Sea, which, neere the shore, is full of deepe, but not dangerous passages. They came then vpon the coast of Lyguria , when they might ken a farre off many ships, which seemed like little Cloudes, or farre- distant Rockes; after they sayled neerer, the Pilote told him, that he thought they were men of warre, or Pyrates which robbed about those Coasts; that the safest course for them, was, to make to the shore, though vnknowne. But the steepe and high Clyffes kept them from landing, to which the ship could not approch betweene the Shelues; neyther, if you could haue come neere, could you finde any way to ascend the Clyffes. While therefore the Mariners stand in a study, and sticke betweene two dangers, the Gallies which were sent out had enclosed them. Arsidas wanted not spirit to defend himselfe, but the fearefull Mariners forthwith shewed the condition of Sea-men. If they stood vpon their owne defence, they must expect nothing but death: but if they yeelded vp their Ship by striking Sayle, they might expect more friendly dealing; because they were taken by lawfull Souldiers, they should suffer little preiudice by yeelding: but if they were Pyrates, they would onely be pleased with goods, and good words. This, the Mariners and Ship-men rehearsed to Arsidas , who, by reason he was slacke in yeelding; themselues strucke Sayle of their owne accord: and taking in their Oares, they stayd the pleasure of these wafting towards them. But when the contrary Gallies had grappled with the Ship, they begin in gentle termes to inquire, what they were, and whither they were bent? The Mariners related all things truely, how they came out of Greece , and were sayling to Marselles , being hyred by a Stranger; and they shewed Arsidas . Now, he answering more doubtfully vpon their demands, as one that knew not to whom hee should speake, seemed to be mistrustfull of them. Being hereupon taken, hee was conueyed into another Ship, and they which carried him, were commanded to follow with their shipping: yet they hurt him not, and desired to be excused, for that they would carry him to the speech of their Gouernour. Not farre after, came the Admirall-Ship; with swelling Sayles, without the helpe of Oares, into which when Arsidas was brought, the Captaine meeting him, gaue him his hand, and told him in Greeke, that hee should not suspect any iniury from them. But this is the order of Warre, faith hee, wee must examine all occasions; Neyther doe wee onely boord enemies, but many times also we informe our selues by friends and Strangers: But if I had gone into your Ship vpon your word speaking, I would haue bin no hinderance, if you desire speed. When Arsidas grew more confident vpon this courteous Language, he related all things as farre as he might: That he was a Sicilian , was going to a friend into France , and hoped that his returne should be short. But the Captaine hearing the name of Sicily , did sticke at it, and inquired what acquaintance he had in France . I would not, said he, it should proue discourtesie, if I intreat you to be my Guest at Supper. You shall rest in my Admirall-Ship, with the best intertainement we can giue you. I am Seruant to a great King, who followeth hard by with the strength of his Army, I will present you to morrow to him, for he loueth to see any man that commeth out of Sicily ; and peraduenture hee will desire to vnderstand somewhat by you. And I thinke also you will count it good fortune to haue met with so gracious a Prince. seeme vnwilling; for, by this meanes, he might be the more suspected; and haue a stricter watch ouer him: feigning therefore a great willingnesse, hee answereth, That hee is altogether at the Gouernours dispose. A Prisoner, and especially guiltlesse, should not auoid the face of any man. After these words on both sides, they framed their mindes and countenances to mirth in their seuerall discourses: The Captaine, that Arsidas should haue no occasion of feare; and Arsidas , that he might not seeme to dislike such bondage. They did therefore heare and aske many things one of the other; and the friendship which was at first feigned, did by little and little touch both with a true delight of discourse: the nature of men beeing such, that noble dispositions are easily reconciled. And Arsidas truely, although he were a Captiue, and hindered in his voyage, yet did willingly forgiue what was done to him, seeing hee had beene the like occasion of hinderance to the other, especially almost intreated to stay not aboue a night in most courteous bondage. But the Captaine himselfe stroue to please Arsidas being innocent, that as a friend hee might be let goe. When therefore both of them sate in the Ship, and were discoursing of the Sea  & Windes, and of the sorts of Gallies, at length Gobrias (so the Captaine was called) questioned him in faire words, of the affaires of Sicily ,  & of the nature of their Countrey. He briefly related the ciuill warres, Lycogenes his insurrection and death, Meleander's old age, and whatsoeuer might be said, without naming Poliarchvs : for hee carefully abstayned from that name, lest hee should be forced to speake of him before a Stranger. Gobrias , delighted with the worthy relation, and the most iust euent of the warre; when afterwards Arsidas would haue asked the name of the King, for whose sight hee was kept, and also of what Countrey hee was King, and what hee intended with his great Fleet, hee considered a little of it; for he desired to requite the others courtesie, and relate the Story of his owne Countrey. Then, saith he, although there be betweene our two Countries little commerce, and that onely by Merchants, yet wee haue heard many things of the ciuill dissention which hath incumbred Sicily ; but no Merchandize is sooner spoyled in bringing, then truth. We haue heard many things different, and many contrary to what we now heare from you: neyther doe I doubt, but that the dangers of our Country, and almost ruine, by some meanes hath come to your cares; but either falsified by the confidence of the Reporters, or by their ignorance. But, that I feare to trouble you with too long a discourse, I would not onely satisfie you in what you demand, but relating from the beginning, I would vnfold the very infancy of my King; a thing worthy to be recorded in History. The excellent subiect of the discourse, allures Arsidas, and he tells You shall therefore heare (replyes Gobrias ) a discourse worthy your Grecian wits: for wee haue amongst vs, the noble acts of many illustrious men, nothing inferiour to those, by which Nations are enabled, who, by learning, celebrate their owne prayse: but we haue onely the Verses of the Drvides , by which the noble actions of our Ancestors are preserued in memory, and yet they are not carued in Wood, or ingrauen in Brasse: they are left to the memory of the young men, and by their Poesies wee vnderstand the actions of our Predecessors: But that I may not burden our customes with complaints, I had rather (Sir) since you are so pleased, begin my promised History. There reigned amongst vs, King Britomandes , a name as yet pleasing to our Countrey-men, valiant in warre, and in peace most prudent. you King, before you tell mee where hee reigned; although I surmise that you are French by your Language. You say right, replyeth Gobrias , we doe inioy all that Coast which the Sea washeth betweene the Alpes , and the Pyrenean Mountaines: towards the Mediterranean, circuiting from whence Rhone and Araris doe fetch their springs, and mingle with the Sea, cutting thorow the fruitfull Fields, is that excellent part of France ; the ground rich in all plenty, and the Land populons with a valiant Nation. But when Gobrias perceiued him musing; Perhaps, saith hee, you doe partly vnderstand it already, and I shall spend my labour in vaine to tell it you, that know it before-hand: therefore, declare to mee, (I pray you) Haue you heard any thing in Sicily , concerning the troubles of our Court? Then answered Arsidas , that he had, and withall, that there are many Kings amongst the French ; and if any newes be brought to vs of them, it is like the Ayre, or a little Cloud, which doth easily passe vs vnawares: because before, we had a little traffique from all parts, and the fury of our intestine broyles hath expelled this also. Now, in this our Grecian sluggishnesse, wee doe little regard the actions of those Countries which lye towards the North, but onely when we heare, that you are to leade an Army out of your Countrey, and then euery body feareth the publique liberty. Doubt not therefore to relate whatsoeuer it be, to one that knoweth nothing, and desireth to be informed. And he spake this, not that he was altogether ignorant in the state of France , but lest Gobrias should wander from his intended discourse, by asking seuerall questions concerning his knowledge in it: for now, hauing heard of the names of Araris and Rhone , he more earnestly desired to heare the History of France , as concerning his businesse. great people, who had a Sonne of the same name, called Britomandes , which, after he came to mans estate, was troubled with so many diseases, that the continuall malady weakened the powers of his vnderstanding: yet hee married a Lady of his owne kindred, to whom I cannot well tel, whether modesty did giue more grace; or piety and her wisdome worthy a stronger Sex: She is called Timandra. Britomandes the Father dying, our happinesse fell (as it were) with his death, and all things did runne from worse to worse. We found nothing in our new King, like his Father, but his name and piety. There liued amongst the Nobility one Commindorix , most powerfull in birth and wealth aboue the rest, and such a one as but now you named Lycogenes to be: although hee was bridled by the feare of so great a King, vnder the rule of opinion of his wisdome and valour, that hee gouerned all things vnder the Kings name; Timandra much disdayning it, who vsed all the meanes to stirre vp in her Husband the courage of his Ancestors. But he, through the weake lenity of his disposition, revealed the whole secret of his Wise to cast downe from the height of happinesse, to which our old King god, vnder the colour of deuotion, but in effect, according to the custome of our Countrey, to aske aduice by Oracle, if any of the gods would shew vs, if we should fall vnder the danger of Commindorix his gouernement: for most did count it a poynt of Religion to haue him in detestation; especially after he was (O vnsufferable villany!) reported, by the helpe of the Nurse, to haue made away our young Prince, borne of Timandra , through his vehement desire of rule. You can hardly imagine how the Queene escaped the same Pill; whether she auoyded the poysoning potion, and his treachery, by her watchfull care, or whether he had no feare of a womans life. Aboue all things, I thinke it was the care of the gods, who oftentimes doe blinde Tyrants, that seeking security by carefull and superstitious rigour, they know not, or feare not apparent and certaine dangers. When Timandra was the second time with Childe, hauing a care of her miserable Issue, which was marked for death, before it was seen to haue life, she consulted in good time with the Mid-wife,  & two of her Women which were most inward with her (whereof I married one by the mediation of the Queene her selfe.) The Queene earnestly desired of these, that if she were deliuered of a Man-childe, they should take him away priuately, and place another in his roome. They chose a certaine Countrey-woman, that was of my Wiues acquaintance, which might nurse the Childe: she was called Sicambre . She, when the Queen was in trauell, was brought into the Court with her husband, being sworne by my wife vnto secrecie, (for there was also need of her Husbands helpe.) None of her women were admitted into her Bed-chamber, but such as were priuy to her intentions, and the gods were fauourable to her. into the Princes Cradle. What doe you thinke did the Queene imagine? She was perplexed in her deliuery, and she accounted it a happinesse to haue her newborne Childe taken from her, which Mothers doe buy with so much payne and anguish. And I haue often heard her say, that nothing more troubled her, then left her deuice should be discouered, by the crying of the young Children, or the feare of the women. But although shee was very ill, both by caretaking, and sicknesse, she spake to Sicambre softly, who had the charge to carry away the Infant in this troublesome time: I coniure thee by all our gods, that thou be not false to me, lest while I indeuour to delude others, I my selfe may be deceiued of my owne Childe: for, whomsoeuer thou wilt, him must I of necessity acknowledge for my owne. To this the woman answered: Great Queene, the gods, to whom you pray, haue granted, that no body shall haue the power to deceiue you by such meanes as you feare; the Childes body hath a marke on it, so notable and remarkeable, and withall, shee holdeth the Infant naked, and sheweth a little below the shoulder-blade, the likenesse of an Eare of Corne in a deepe red Spot: the like red marke was in his right Legge. His Mother shewed the reason of those happy markes, when perchance shee walked on foot in the Fields, affrighted with a suddaine amazement at the noyse of a Whirle- winde, which had run-ouer, and layd flat the Corne of a great Field. Then, quoth Timandra , after she had kissed her sweet Child, flye, my little One, the danger of thy Fathers Court; flye, my Astioristes (for so I will haue thee called, by thy Great-grand-fathers name;) the gods grant thou mayst in good time reuenge them, who wil not suffer thy infancy safely to suck at my brests: and kissing it againe, she lets fall teares. Sicambre , presently after she had taken it back, swaddled it vp, and departed quickly out of the Court, by a Posterne-gate which was opened for the purpose. But then the little Infant, which they had placed there for the Kings Childe, is laid in the Cradle; and Britomandes being called to see his Childe, came in with which after he had commended to the Nurses, and had comforted his Queene lying in Childe-bed, he goeth to the Chappell to giue the gods thankes, bound to their goodnesse for a greater benefit than he was then aware of. woman of a meane condition, because the Infant had not bin so well concealed with people of greater fortune; neyther could she haue hoped for sufficient succour for the tender Infant in a needy family. She had brought her husband, who was priuy to it (his name is Ceriobistvs ) to whom, not farre from the Court, she deliuereth her most sacred pledge,  & desireth him easily to carry it. Pitty, and the greatnesse of the expected reward, did sufficiently commend to him his Foster-childe. Going therfore from his wife, that the family might not suspect he went to his own house, for he had a competent liuing vpon the brink of the Riuer Rhone neere to no Towne, and had preserued the credit of his Family by his honest plain dealing; when he came home, he gaue out, that he had taken vp an Infant exposed at the woods-side; not long after, he met with his Wife comming home, and asketh her (before his Seruants) if that shee would giue sucke to this poore Infant, for her brests were not yet dry after the weaning of her Childe. But the woman, as if she had vnderstood nothing, seriously inquired of all things: What were the Childes Parents? How he found the poore little Infant? or why, being so sweet a Childe, it was cast away? Nature hauing done her part, in giuing him proportionable lineaments? He dissembled that he knew nothing else, then that in the crosse-way of the Wood, onely frequented by Shepheards or Hunters, the Infant lay exposed by some vnmercifull and miserable hand. As he was speaking Sicambre tooke it vp crying, and made it quiet, by giuing it sucke. So, the Princely Issue hauing gotten swaddling-Clouts, meane indeed for the greatnesse of his birth, but happy for the troublesome time, as soone as hee could goe and speake, began to grow after a more comely shape than was vsually seene in such a Countrey-house: hee had a louely disposition, not vnlike his comely feature; especially Chronistvs and Sicambre , by the motion of their owne knowledge and affection, admired all things in him, and called him was the name of many of their Princes. But these things could scarce safely be told to the Queene, whom Sicambre did now and then recreate with the ioy of stolne discourse, comming once in a moneth to my wife: for Countrey-people feared to be seene often in the Court, being likewise warned by the Ladies which were acquainted with their businesse, that by all meanes they should auoyd suspition.  Childe. His courtesie and beauty. The inuention of Gobrias and  of seeing her Sonne, spake to me, whom shee had made Steward of her House, in this manner: Thou hast not deserued ( Gobrias ) that I should esteeme thy trust lighter then a womans: It is long since I made thy Wife priuy to my chiefest secrets, and I will giue this first thanks for the secrecie which she hath shewed in all my businesse, that I will also vnburden my cares to thy knowledge, and discouer a notable act, in the concealement whereof, both mine and the generall safety consisteth. Knowest thou not, Gobrias , what I would haue the doe? Did thy Wife tell thee nothing concerning my businesse? Besides, that I was moued with the expectation of the secret, as yet I more plainely dissembled my countenance, that the Queene might thinke, I did owe her the full thankes for relating so great a secret to me; and farther, that I might the better commend my Wiues trust to her, who had neyther told me all, nor had altogether deceiued my thoughts, surmising that there was some great action in hand. But then the Queene, not onely freely, but also pleasantly related the whole matter to me. At the hearing whereof, suspecting nothing of so great consequence, I stood amazed, and by little and little, recollecting my selfe in the course of her speech, I praysed her motherly care, and cunning, profitable for the Kingdome, which a Tyrant gaped after. Then, saith she, you may know where my happinesse consisteth: although I am seated in honour, and furnished with all riches, yet I know not that comfort which priuate women haue. Let vs keepe, by the helpe of the gods, Gobrias , this security for our old age, and this destruction of the murtherer Grand-father, then his Father. I vnderstand, that he is most hopefull yet, and I haue sometimes seene his countenance, when his Nurse brought him of purpose, that I might haue a glance of him, into the Temple. But what a misery did you thinke it, that hauing but one Sonne, I may not safely see him, and not at all speake with him? I pray thee goe to the house wherein he is nursed, for thou mayst easily feigne somewhat for the excuse of thy iourney. I commit to thee a comfort, which I should inioy my selfe, and I will thinke that I doe inioy it in part, if thou shalt please thy selfe with what thou hast in charge. Then thou shalt relate to me in good earnest, what thou dost coniecture of the disposition of the Boy, and peraduenture thou maist deuise some meanes with Sicambre , that I may, though but slightly, without suspition, imbrace him. The Queene hauing deliuered her minde, I gaue her humble thankes, as in duty I ought, that she would make choyce of my helpe in a secret of so great importance. I was in my owne heart an Enemy to Commindorix , and did willingly scorne the danger which that hope and priuity might afford. The next day therefore I tooke my iourney, and following the way which was directed by the common people, I came to the house; and after, I found the way in: In the Close where the Husband-mens tooles, and their Plow-shares lay, I saw a certaine company of Boyes playing amongst themselues, most innocently wanton. I approched neerer to them, to see if I could finde by chance, the cause of my iourney, amongst that childish troupe. O stranger, I needed no teacher to shew me: the powerfull excellency of nature did sufficiently poynt out the Issue of so many Heroick Princes; the rest, out of their clownish or childish feare, runne away, or turning their backes, fearefully looke ouer their shoulders at mee. He stood, nothing moued at the countenance of a Stranger: He had a Bow fit for his yeres and strength, on which he leaned, resting it on the ground, and stayd for me. The whole Garbe of his behauiour was confident and free: his hayre was somewhat yellow, and shewed the better, by the carelesse wearing of it: for it did not onely hang ouer his shoulders, but by his violence in play, it fell ouer his heated fore-head: he had an Eye which commanded and intreated; such a countenance, fore-head, and cheekes, as we see in the Picture of Cvpid . I did shake at the sudden reuerence of him, and presently prayed to the gods, that they would preserue, what themselues had giuen vs. I was afraid to speake to him, as to a Childe of meane condition. But, lest I should trouble the sport, I only alighted from my Horse, and asked whether his Parents were busied, and how he himselfe did? He answered, That his Father was working in the Field with his people, but his Mother was at home, and, if I would, hee would call her forth. Doe, I prethee, sweet Boy, quoth I, and, if it be not troublesome, I will goe with thee to the doore. Then hee began to leade mee the way; and I asked in iest, against what Beasts he did vse his Bow. He answered presently, with a pretty innocence; My Father doth not suffer mee as yet to hunt Wolues with our Stichus and Ambirnius ; he has put mee off from that sport yet for one yeere. And whatsoeuer you be (Stranger) I will rest your debtor, if you will tell mee how many dayes will make vp a whole yeere: For I haue found my selfe many times deceiued by such promises, because I am a Child, and know not how the yeere passeth. I, smiling at him, said, Thou askest mee this question in vaine, for thy memory will not serue thee to obserue so long a time, as thou wouldst haue mee reckon to thee. Yes, saith hee, I would haue you giue mee so many pibble stones, as there be dayes in the yeere: I will hide them, and euery day draw out one, vntill the yeere be ended. I applauded the child's wit, and went the softlier of purpose, that I might the longer enioy his pleasant company. But was a Stranger talking with her Sonne: and as carefull of her great charge, with a countenance full of feare, she came towards vs. But as soone as shee knew mee, being as yet vncertaine, whether I did know of what condition the Child was with whom I talked, or whether Fortune only had directed me that way to her, she intreated mee to goe into her house, earnestly demanding the occasion of my iourney, and how my wife did. But after wee were set downe, smiling one vpon the other in our discourse; I haue much (said I) to complaine of my Wife, except you take vpon you the blame, and acknowledge your selfe to haue giuen her a lesson, so deeply to dissemble in keeping counsell. I giue neither of you thankes, in that I now know That your little young child, whom yee so obstinately concealed from mee: but I am beholding to the Queene, by whose command I come to see you, and to conferre with you, by what meanes she might satisfie her longing heart with the like happinesse: for in that shee sees him sometimes in in the Church, is little or nothing to fulfill the longing of a mother. She would kisse him, shee would speake to him, and once at least satisfie her longing, with a neerer enioying of him. It was easie for Sicambre to excuse her silence: then shee was glad that I was acquainted with this secresie by the Queenes owne directions; and shewed mee many wayes, how Astioristes might be brought to his Mother: but all meanes were dangerous, and did not please her selfe. We pawsed a long time, and could thinke of no safer course, then that Sicambre , as she often came to visit my wife, should bring the child with her, vnto a Lordship which I had, not farre from the Citie, and the Queene going to take the ayre, should pretend a desire to goe see the walkes which I had at my Mannor house; and afterwards shee should quietly, in a priuate roome, imbrace and freely kisse her Astioristes , without danger, or the least suspition. The time therefore being agreed vpon with Sicambre , when shee should come to my house, I iested againe with the child, to make as much tryall as I could of his disposition. Then hugging him in my armes, borne to be King (if the gods prospered him) of a great Land; after my leaue taking, I departed from thence to the next Towne, the morning after I came to the Court. When I had related all things to Timandra , this did most trouble her, that she must yet stay two daies, before she could enioy her happinesse, and the time being come, and all things ripe, and Sicambre also come with the Child, the Queene came, with as little a trayne as she could possibly, and walking a little in the Garden, she told my wife, that she would rest a little in her Chamber. My wife led her into a Roome which was most priuate, where no-body could heare what they spake: then they dismissed all, except those that knew of the businesse, as if the Queene were gone to sleepe. Faithfull Sicambre was conueyed in by a backe Chamber, and deliuered to the Queene, her Sonne kneeling on his knees. The Queene suffered me to be present; but what I saw and heard, no tongue, no diligence can relate: ioy, piety, griefe, and the pleasure in louing and bemoning him, exceeded all measure in the Queene. Stopping her language with a long sigh, and the violence of her other affections, at length she leapeth to the child, and imprisons him in her armes, vntill they are almost both faint: and not dwelling vpon one kind of expression, sometimes she puts him from her, that she might with the freer scope obserue his countenance, his eye, and the whole gesture of his body: now againe would she embrace him in her armes, through the sudden violence of her tender loue; and kisse euery good part in him, which she admired. Sometimes would she seeme more confident, as if what she perceiued in the child, were her owne: and then, I thinke, foretelling him to bee her auenger, shee began most boldly to despise Commindorix : loue againe more kindled by stealth, desired to enioy the fulnes of happinesse: and then the thought that shee must presently leaue her ioy, made her mad loue fall into lamentations. What shall I say more? None of vs there present, but wept at the sight of so deepe and pitifull affection. But they would not let the Child know how great hee was; for his tender yeeres could not warrant secresie; and if by chance this should haue come to light, the Tyrant (questionlesse) would haue made him away. Among all the blandishments therefore, which Timandra vsed to her Son, she let fall no word, by which hee might know, either that shee were the Queene or his Mother. But hee, abashed at the sight of an immoderate ioyfull and then sad woman, and being farther wearied with those continued kisses, when at last he perceiued vs all to weepe, he also began tocry; and ignorant in whose imbraces he was, yet he folded his little armes about her, as if Nature had bin his Teacher. But the tendernesse of those yeeres, voyd of any Congee, care, or discretion, easily weaned him from that fond affection, and he began to view in his childish obseruation, the Queenes trimming and attire, hauing neuer seene the like before: and then the Pallets and Couches, and euery kinde of Furniture in the Chamber, which he had neuer before obserued, made him stop in the viewing of them; that wee also falling into affectionate loue with his pretty harmlesse sport, did follow his lookes and carriage in a most pleasing imitation. While we are thus occupied, the houre was come; neither might we make the Queenes trayne suspect any thing by our long stay: but she would not suffer her Sonne to be taken from her, vntill she deceiued her selfe with the hope of enioying it more freely hereafter; and fetching a deepe sigh, shee turned from the child, and caused him to be carried away. But this was her hope; she would haue me goe to Sicambre's house, with some few in my company, that should know nothing of my businesse; either vnder the colour of hunting, or of any other more conuenient occasion; and there exceedingly to praise the shape and towardlinesse of young Astioristes , and to begge him of his parents openly, with promise to see him well bred and educated at home with me, for he did not seeme to be borne for the Country, and such a melancholike life: and then, that Sicambre , after she had long seemed vnwilling, should at last consent to it with her husband. After this, the Child was to be brought to the Towne, to bee deliuered to my wife, and to giue him such breeding as was fitting his yeeres. So we were appointed Gardians ouer him, and he should fully satisfie his Mother, not with a short and tumultuary sight.  of Astioristes . The warre betweene the French and the Allobroges . The defeat of Aneroestvs . The taking of a Youth vnknowne, and his keeping.  for three dayes were hardly past, when Cerovistvs, Sicambre's Husband, came running into our house, with his clothes torne, and all the signes of lamentation and sorrow; and as soone as he sau mee, nothing dissembling his sorrow, hee striketh his brest with both his hands; The gods, quoth he, night-robbers; and it is questionable whither they haue carried him, or whether he be liuing: a company of armed men carried him away the next night after, who hauing first rifled mee, then set my house on fire. Neither did this plague ouer-run mee onely and my neighbours; but they carried booties out of all the Villages about vs; and I being alone left by this boysterous storme, could not possibly follow their tracts, because they wafted speedily ouer the Rhone , in Boats laid for that purpose. What therefore will you haue me to doe, or whither to goe? At this newes of Gobrias, Arsidas as waxed pale, as if he had beene a sharer in the losse and misfortune; exclaiming vpon the detestable villany, and then often asking if the child so perished; because he expected greater matters from him, which also concerned the businesse that hee then had in charge. But quoth Gobrias , I was much more appalled at the newes than I now doe see you to be: yet I could not be remisse in my speedy care for this so dangerous mischiefe. I commanded therefore the man, that he should for a while suppresse his vnprofitable mourning, and declare at large whatsoeuer had happened. Hauing heard the full relation, I considered diuersly, with my selfe, from whence these Theeues should come; or whether they had falne vpon the Child vpon deliberate consideration; with what speede, or what strength I might make after them; or at least whether I should make knowne this vnlucky chance to the Queene. But I shall tell you this better at leisure; for I see it is supper time, and my seruants haue brought mee word that it will bee spoyled But you shall draw no mirth from me, saith Arsidas , except you free mee from this care; how you freed him from the Theeues, and what punishment the Queene inflicted on them. wanted no part of sorrow and care, although priuately they mourned, and vnder a different pretence made search after the Theeues. But the child beeing taken away, they could not tell how to helpe it, for they could neither finde them which carried him away; neither had they any certaine directions which way to enquire for him. The Queene therefore layd also the blame heereof on not onely blamed for their owne offences, but sometimes they beare the burden of other mens faults. Afterwards it was more certainely knowne, that these Robbers, gathering a troupe together in the Mountaines of the Allobroges , that they might offend with lesse punishment in a strange Countrey than in their owne, passed ouer the Rhone , and being laden with their spoyles, and ferried backe into their owne Countrey, deuiding their booties, they broke vp company, lest they should be discouered by their multitude. And so the pretty child, said hee, was lost; and his mother almost dead after the losse of him. dreame, the preparation for a great building, which, after it was somewhat roared by the workmen, and beautified with carued stones and pictures, in the very applause of them that wakened mee, it vanisht away: So, after thou hadst preserued the child, after thou hadst bred him to the yeeres wherein hee promised that he was preserued for some good purpose, suddenly thou takest him from vs. At these words, chafing within himselfe, he smiled inwardly at had brought to no conclusion. And Gobrias did also vnderstand that the man was troubled. That he might therefore restore to his Guest a cheerefull countenance, If you will suppe merrily (saith he) I will bring backe the Child, and deliuer him safe to his Mother. Arsidas shewed a great alteration at these words, who wished happy successe to the Child, with greater desire than Gobrias could imagine. But when they were set at the Table, Gobrias excused himselfe to his Guest, that he had placed one of the Druides in the highest place of the Table; for it was the religious custome of the French , to seat the Druides , either at Banquets or shewes; in the most honourable Roome. Arsidas sate at his right hand; long discourse of these learned Priests: Gobrias doubting, whether declared, that they had not onely the chiefe sway in matters of Religion amongst the French , but also, that the determining of controuersies was committed vnto them, and that all the Youth was instructed by them, he related at large, how much they regard Poetry, as an excellent study; dwelling somewhat longer vpon that discourse, that hee might bee desired to relate something of them. Which when Arsidas perceiued, and forced his willingnesse, he related Verses, as he said, but lately made by himselfe, in which the iustice of the gods was magnified, who suffering themselues for a long time to bee remisse in punishing, at last, to shew their iustice, doe recompence offenders.  You guilty soules, whose mad iniquities Too long prouoke the gods, doe not despise Their slow reuenge; the woes of your sad state, Their doomes deferring shall ingeminate: Though Iove be slacke; nor for each crime below, Docs from the Skie his armed Thunder throw; Yet iustice numbring all your sinnes with care, Does the whole summe to Nemesis declare. Hence come all sorts of death; and, deadlier farre Then death, distraction, and brest-rending care: Hence deluges, when borne by water vp, The foamy Tritons ride vpon the top Of Cities drown'd, nor need it be rehears'd, How Corne is blasted, scattered, or dispers'd By raging winds; or Bores, by often wounds Of their crooke tuskes, lay waste the pasture grounds; Or when from poysonous ayres, we draw swift death, Through our infected bodies as we breathe: Or when on Townes deuouring flames in ire These wayes the gods reuenge, (lest wee should thinke Them slacke, or easie at our crimes to winke) Punish deseruing Nations; wasting then Their people by all fates: but me, wretch'd men, Know not whose wrath sends a distemper'd Skie, Pestilent yeeres, that men vntimely dye; We Nature, Fortune, and th' vnhappy frame Of our weake bodies constitutions blame. Nature, alas offends not; no worke came Amisse from heauen: our sinnes call downe the stroke Of lingring Fates, and their hid wrath prouoke. Supper being had, as good as could be expected vpon the Sea, and in time of warre: It is time, said Arsidas , to seeke all places beyond the Rhine , and fetch your Prince out of obscurity. Then answered Gobrias , We did then what we could, but all our endeuours were in vaine: wee bewayled his losse for foure yeeres; the fift yeere we had an vneuitable warre against the Allobroges , beeing in controuersie about their bounds, and spoyling their happy neighbours. It is much materiall to know the seuerall euents of that warre, especially skirmishing with suddaine and small forces. Wee had one set battell, in which the Allobroges being discomfited, were beaten out of their Trenches. Our Army was rich in booty, and could hardly containe their Captiues and spoyles, with many chaines and bracelets of gold (as the custome of the French is) in that ouerthrow. There were three Kings of the Allobroges discomfited in that conflict; amongst which, the greatest in honour and dignity was called Aneroestvs ; whose Pauilion while the Conquerours ransackt, a certaine souldier, perceiuing a young Lad of excellent feature standing at the entrance of it, neglecting his booty, much desired to take him prisoner. He, shaking his Iauelin with greater courage than could bee expected in such tender yeeres, denyed to yeeld as long as he had life; neither would the Souldier hurt his delicate body; but calling a companion to him, they enuironed this fighting Boy; and so now holding his armes, they wrest out of his being full of rage, his now vnusefull weapons. Those hands did seeme to be vnworthy of manacles, and no deceit could be feared from so noble a disposition. If he would therefore ascertaine to be true prisoner, they promised that he should be freed from any signes of captiuity, and goe with them, more like a companion then a Captiue. He, with a countenance nothing deiected at his misery, told them that he could notwithstand the gods, whom it had pleased to lay this captiuity on him, and that he would bee no lesse carefull to keepe his faith now to them, then before to defend his liberty. It was not without the great prouidence of the gods, that a Youth so pleased Souldiers. They now carried him away willingly, and fearing enuy, they suffered him not to be seene by many. They were not now farre from the Court, when they happened vpon mee. If I haue any faith, I stood amazed at the young Lads countenance, and asking them earnestly, (for I knew them also) from whence they had this booty, and whether they would sell him? They answered, That hee was the principall amongst all the Captiues, and they kept him as a Present for Commindorix . I thinke they named Commindorix , fearing lest I should aske him for my selfe. You know that the French Cassocks couer not the whole body: whilest I therefore doe more exactly obserue his lookes, and I know not what great matter the gods did put into my mind; by chance he turned his shoulder, and in the twinkling of an eye, I was almost ouercome with excessiue ioy: For what can I imagine answerable to that my happinesse? I espyed (my deare Guest) the marke of his Princely birth; I saw that eare of corne, of naturall purple, which, as I told you before, the Fates had printed in the Queenes Sonne. I could not speake, I was so much ouer-ioyed, faintnesse also,  & ashaking of my legs, yet troubled my doubtfull and carefull thoughts. Then, I prayed secretly to the gods, the gouernours of Kingdomes, that they would be fauourable to so great hope. You haue found, said I, an excellent gift for Commindorix ; but marke me, fellow-souldiers, Might you not better giue it to the Queene? His yeeres will yet admit him into the Nurcery, and perhaps hereafter he may freely require you, remembring by whom he was presented to the Queene. For if you giue him to Commindorix , yet he will come to the Queenes hands, and then Commindorix will gaine all the thankes for the gift, which may be your reward, if you deale wisely. The souldiers conferring a little together, gaue me thankes that I had thus profitably aduised them; and they desired that I would be a meanes to bring them to the Queene. But I did not onely take that vpon mee, but being carefull of my most beloued booty, and desirous also to know by the Lad the certainety, I intreated them to supper. After wee came home, I began mildly to speake to the Youth, and aske him his name. But he answered, When first he was taken prisoner, he was called Masters would name him. Then said I, Were you once taken prisoner before? Yes, replyed he. And from whence, my little Lad? And what was thy first name? As farre as I can remember, saith hee, when I was but little, I was taken away by a company of Free-booters out of my Fathers house; neither doe I remember any thing more, but that we liued in the Countrey, and that my mother called me of those who carried me away; amongst whose children I happely spent some yeeres, with almost equall maintenance and courteous vsage: and to traine me vp in military discipline, he would haue me see these warres, in which, alas, what is become of the King, I know not, and I must vndergoe other fortunes, and (as I thinke) worse. And while he was speaking, he seemed much afflicted in mind. But I, knowing the truth of the businesse, praised the gods, vnto whom I did rather attribute the disposition hereof, than vnto Fortune. O my Lad, said I, the gods haue done all things for thy good; neither be thou vnthankful to the Destinies, who haue set thee at liberty after so many misfortunes, in the Queenes houshold: and thou art preserued, my Boy, for great fortune.  Soldiers present the Youth: shee giueth him to Gobrias to conceale. ouerthrowne in the warre, and loseth his two Sonnes. Astioristes his exercises.  restlesse thoughts of excessiue hope and all content, I gaue notice to the Souldiers, that I would goe to the Queene, and gaine meanes of accesse for them. I put me on a richer habit than I did vsually weare; and I had a Garland, as if I were going to sacrifice; and my countenance also was more cheerefull at the apprehension of the ioy; all which, the pleasantnesse of the new purchased victory did excuse. When I had done my reuerence to the Queene in this habit, I determined a little to deceiue her, and not ouer-ioy her at the first. Therefore I said, Wonder not, Madam, at this vnaccustomed lightnesse of heart: the gods, by a secret reuelation in my dreames, forced thee to it: perchance you will call me superstitious; but the representation was so infallible which I saw in my sleepe, that I could not count it as a dreame. Neither may I dissemble longer, I am glad for your sake: Mercvry , I thinke, hath declared, that this betokeneth a happy day to you; or perhaps there be other messengers of the gods, who doe foretell to men in their dreames, what will happen hereafter. Then said the Queene, But what mountaines of ioy be these, Gobrias ? or rather, what madnes? Vpon this I replied, That a little before day, when men most vsually dreame, I did see a Strippling of a most honest aspect, calling to me thus: Goe to the Queene, Gobrias ; tell her, that I will come to her; shee shall see him this day, whom shee so earnestly desireth in all assured content. But what art thou, said I? for there is little difference by thy countenance and disposition, betweene thee  & any of the race of the gods. He then seem'd discontented. Are you so forgetful of Astioristes , that you need a Nomenclator? Dost thou not know the son of Timandra , thy Prince? Presently I knew his speech, and labouring in vaine to embrace him, the violence of the passion awakened me, and by my vnwelcome watchfulnes, I lost the sight of the Boy. You may vnderstand from hence, Madam, that it was some heauenly presage, that by the prouidence of the gods, I iudge not amisse of the successe: You shall enioy this day your Astioristes . The Queene, vpon the newes heereof, cast down her mourning countenance towards the ground, and now raising her selfe againe, she sheweth no matter of content, that I now repented of my iest. Why dost thou (said shee) call to mind the fresh memory of my griefes? This was either a vaine illusion of an vnsettled sleepe; or if the gods doe really intend any thing by it, I shall dye to day, and then shall enioy my Sonne amongst the ghosts. Nay, Madam, said I, except my promises proue succesfull, either I would haue you banish mee, or, which is worse, perpetually hate mee. I will goe to the Temple, and pray to the gods, that they will performe what they haue promised mee. I drew her with such cheerefulnesse to hope; and presently going out, I reckoned my house for the Temple and the gods, from whence I should draw out this happinesse. Placing therefore the Souldiers before the Court Gate with their Present, with the Captaine of the Guard, my speciall friend; but who knew nothing of the Plot, afterwards to be brought in to the Queene; to whom I returned in the meane time, and said nothing, to see what she would speake. I perceiued her to bee troubled; for sometimes she walked according to her vsuall rate; then againe her perplexed thoughts vexed her when shee sate downe; often also did shee cast her eye vpon mee; when, behold, the Captaine of the Guard, as hee was intreated by mee, came in, and told her, that there was a very hansome young Lad taken in the warre, whom two Souldiers had brought to the Queene for a gift. though explaining themselues; and suspecting nothing lesse, she commanded that the Soldiers should be admitted. But, deare Guest, as soone as they came into her presence with their gift, her astonishment and affection increasing by degrees, she did shrinke for feare, as if she had bin suddenly taken in a trance. The hope I had put her in, would scarce suffer her to heare the Souldiers presenting their gift: but of her owne will, with a rash and vncircumspect hastinesse, shee looked vpon the shoulder of the child; and knowing the natiue marke, that she might hide her distracted thoughts, she cast her Gowne for a while ouer her face, as if her eyes had not beene well. Afterwards, being better tempred, she vncouered her face, and at length, after gracious promises and thankes, dismissing the Souldiers, shee graciously spake to mee in priuate these words: O thou Iuggler! What, didst thou dreame waking, and count that as a dreames phantasie, which thou knewest to be reall, that thou mightst thereby deferre my ioyes? Dost thou know how I will be reuenged on thee? Your reward shall be flower, which, I confesse, I am indebted to you. You shall hereafter relate to me, by what fortune you happened vpon the Child: now take him, and giue him education as for our seruice. let vs giue him such breeding as may befit his birth: In the meane time, wee may enioy without suspition his sight and conference. After these words in priuate, she deliuered the child publikely to me, whom we called Scordanes : and shee, to reioyce more freely, withdrew herselfe. But wee faithfully paid the Soldiers their reward, which was Princely indeed, but not to be enuyed, or equall to the gift: yet behold the violence of a suddaine and dangerous tempest in this great calme. The King Aneroestvs signifieth by his Messengers, that hee will giue a hundred Talents for the Youth, if any body can bring him backe, whom hee so much esteemed, and accounted as one of his owne Children. Wee were much dismayed at the importunacy of his liberall offer: for, with what enuy or suspicion should the Queene keepe him, whom his most affectionate Patrone did set at so high a price? And besides, it would seeme inhumane cruelty, to barre the old Man from so much comfort, and the Ladde from so great a good: or whether Scordaanes himselfe would stay, when hee should be of ability to goe away: or whether hee might not be stolne away, by some that were greedy of the great Reward offered. While wee feare these things, and that wee cannot agree with Aneroestvs , nor with honesty keepe the Childe, Fortune, which was auerse to Aneroestvs , was fauourable to vs: forasmuch as his owne Subiects did rise vp against him. It was a suddaine Warre, and the conclusion proued deadly, by the death of his two Sonnes, of great hope and expectation. I thought that hee himselfe (although his dead body could not be found) had dyed amongst the rest; and then they who had deposed him, by ambitious tyranny vsurped his Kingdome. his yeeres, in the old King. Yet at length, by delay, and (who would beleeue it in a Childe?) wee pacified him by arguments. So, being restored to himselfe, and preserued for vs beyond expectation, hee filled people of all sorts and all quality in the Court, with his great admiration. He grew so excellent both in horsemanship, fencing, and shooting, that his Teachers enuyed his dexterity: neyther was he proud, or arrogant by nature. All desired to yeeld to him, because he ouercame all in nothing more, then in humanity and courtesie. He was most courteous in speech: he would be humble to all, seeke all mens loue, merry-conceited in words, which, lest they should proue offensiue to others, he would first put them vpon himselfe. Besides, hee had a youthfull agility, which he strengthned by wrastling and practizing his weapons, by running also and hunting, and breaking of Colts. By much watching also, slender dyet, and by vse inabled to indure all extremities of weather, with good health of body: or else, (which the Queene and I most reioyced at in our hearts) hee would not onely shew his disposition, but his words and actions.  The Enterprise of Commendorix . The resolution of the King Britomandes . The Queene discouereth that Astioristes is her sonne.  ripen his courage and strength, lest we should all be vndone, because hee grew most insufferably insolent ouer good men, imboldning himselfe by daily villanies, and knowing how securely he might despise Britomandes . At last he almost openly effected the title of King; his followers being heard to speake as much in their ambitious discourses and meetings; That the Kingdome was sicke vnder Britomandes , and must be cured by one of great ability; That the Kingdome should owe more to Commendorix , then was all one to Britomandes , who was altogether vnfit to sway it; and besides that, wanted issue Male, which might succeede him; That great courage. And now the deuillish plot had almost taken effect. It was reported, how the Tyrant questioned, in what Fortresse the King, with his Queene Timandra , might be safest kept; what Pension should be appointed for their Diet; what Attendance for them both, and what Guard. And to conclude, he so little esteemed the abiect Britomandes , that hee durst seriously aske, if hee would voluntarily leaue the Crowne, which was painfull and troublesome by the great businesse incident to it; because he imagined, that he should auoid much enuy, if hee gain'd it by his consent. The King, prouok't by so shamefull a language, for that time bridled his anger, but afterwards he began to bewaile his fortune to Timandra . Shee, thinking that there was no time for delay, and at least determining to die couragiously, if Fortune should proue crosse to them; I haue found the meanes, deare Husband (saith she) by which I may defend you from your wicked enemy: but my chiefe feare is, lest you should faile me by your too much gentlenesse, and confound vs both, by laying vs too open to our enemies. But the King binds himselfe by Oath, both by the heauenly and infernall gods, not onely to be assistant to her indeuours by his secrecy, but also by his authority; that hee acknowledged how much hee had offended by his owne weaknesse, but now that he would gather vp his spirits, through the danger and calamity which did now threaten them. (saith she) to morrow morning we will maintaine our honour as Conquerors, or dye as Princes. But she imparted her counsels to none vntill that night; onely that she warned some of her most trusty friends, that they should come to her before the day-breaking. And she commanded me not onely to attend, but also to bring my Pupill with me, with a countenance so farre from distemperature, that I could coniecture no vnusuall or troublesome thing. dayes before to the Kings House, where were Parkes and Game onely, preserued for the Kings pleasure. Presently therefore vpon day light, wee met at the Court, as wee were commanded. Wee were not aboue sixteene whom she placed before the King, all of the Nobility, and priuately or publiquely enemies to she spake to the King; I am yet doubtfull, my Lord, whether in your iudgement it be a fault, what I come to confesse to you, as a glorious deed: for I haue kept close from you your happiness, that it might be the more secure to you: which your enemies would haue taken from you, but now it shall be able to preuent their mischiefe. Pardon therefore what hath beene kept so long secret from you, that you could not know how much you were indebted to the gods: and that I may discouer briefly the whole circumstance, cease to beleeue that you are childlesse, and want an Heyre to your Crowne, as long as that Youth liueth: for by all the gods and goddesses, as many as I may name, this is your owne sonne. I was deliuered of him vnknowne to you, and dissembled that I had a Daughter, which for that little time it liued, you called Timandra , after my name. The reason of that pretence was, lest, the wicked plots of although it be not good to praise one that is present, yet I will speake what cannot be concealed, that he hath a towardly disposition, worthy his noble Progenitors, and that the gods haue fauoured my intentions more then I could possibly expect from them; because hee happened into the hands of faithfull Keepers, though they were poore, as soone as he was borne. So the Infant was nursed, and began to grow to some yeeres vnder them, when a company of Theeues, or rather the prouidence of the more fauourable gods brought him to the Court of a forreine Prince; In which, without suspicion, he was trayned vp in an eminent and industrious life: from thence he was rendred backe againe to me, vnder the colour of a Present; so hee spent his childe-hood, and so hee began his manhood, that hee might begin to be vsefull, now when for our Soueraigne: for, how neere are you to the brinke of captiuity? What other thing doe we expect, but imprisonment? Take heed rather, dearest Husband, and in one houre reuenge his insolency, which hath had the growth of so many yeeres. But if by your accustomed lenity, you will neglect your selfe, yet preserue the Kingdome left by your Ancestors to this your Successor; and take pitty of your Nobility whom you see here: for there is none of them who must not eyther suffer death, or expect punishment worse then death from the Tyrant, because they haue stood for your Royall Maiesty and dignity. But doe not now betray your owne honour, your wife, your childe, and the safety of so many faithfull and constant friends. Doe not doubt of my truth, as if, to alter the present state of things, I should falsly call this your Royall Issue. Behold the infallible markes in his necke, and on the Legge, as the Seales of the Destinies, by which being lost and found by seuerall aduentures, hee hath nor deceiued mee and them which were priuy to this secrecy. But besides, the times are such, that although this were a deuice inuented by mee, you should take the benefit of the commodious occasion; beguile your Enemy, who cannot be tamed by any meanes better, then by the nouelty. After you haue settled your peace, you may better inquire of his birth. Now, if you doe not beleeue what is true, yet it concernes you, that you should seeme to beleeue it. Then turning to her Sonne: O my Astioristes , said shee, (for so wee called thee when thou wert borne) let me now at last imbrace thee freely: O my Sonne, thou which wert the occasion of so many teares to me, and of so many vowes to the gods, turne thy face, and let mee kisse thee. Now at length I finde thee to be my Sonne, and that I am a Mother.  The King Britomandes receiueth Astioristes for his Sonne: Hee mustereth Souldiers. Commendorix stayed by Astioristes : The Combate betweene them.  knew all things to bee true, which she had related; neyther was I altogether free from astonishment, that shee had discouered it to the King so suddenly without my priuity; But you might perceiue by all mens lookes, what a strange thing this was to them. All did cast their eyes on her in a deepe silence; then, some of them called on the gods, others shed teares of ioy, or holding vp their hands, secretly applauded the witty inuention of Fortune: for the Queene had liued with such an opinion of all, that none could suspect any guile from her. But no body was so rauisht with admiration, as the King and to goe or speake, sometimes cast his eyes on the Queene, to whom he gaue credit, through the long experience of her loyalty; and sometimes on his Sonne, who stood amazed with no small disturbance of mind: for when the Queene put her armes about his necke, not daring to refuse her courteous imbraces, he was yet doubtfully afraid what to offer. But the Queene being imboldened at the sight of her Husbands teares; I pray you suffer (quoth shee) most deare Husband, that he may kneele at your feet; or if you now finde your selfe to be a Father, first reach out your hand to him. But the King replyed, The gods shew not themselues so much my enemies, most deare Spouse, that I should refuse this my Sonne, who by his merit and good opinion, promiseth increase of honour to his royall birth: for trusting assured to your chaste thoughts, and vnspotted conuersation, I question not but that he is my Sonne. But notwithstanding if your selfe should be deceiued, and imagine that to be which is not, yet will I adopt him for my Sonne; that if the bands of nature did not plead for him, yet he should make me a Father by adoption: and withall, he fell vpon him as hee was kneeling. The illustrious Youth, renowned for his approued worth, had already gayned the good opinion of all men. No enuy therefore of so great happinesse distayned the affection of those, who were present. Now they beheld him as their Lord and Master; then they kisse his hand, and honour him. And the grauer sort call to minde Britomandes his Grand-father; and sometimes truely, sometimes their affections a little blinding their eyes, they tell how Nature had bequeathed much of his Grand-fathers graces to this noble Youth. Then the King began to inquire of the Queene, by what meanes the gods had thus preserued his Sonne. But Timandra answered, That the discourse would hinder their mirth. Let vs keepe off danger that threatneth vs: As long as Commindorix shall liue, I will neyther beleeue that wee are Princes, and haue power, nay scant that wee are Subiects, and may liue. With what minde, thinke you, will that insolent Man looke vpon this increase of your Progeny? But if you will be ruled by mee, I will pare his nayles: you may easily and speedily possesse the affections of the Subiects and Souldiers: O, that your health would suffer you to goe to them, and openly to make tryall of their loue in businesse of this importance! Then saith hee, I can goe, Madam, I can goe; and, if you thinke it the best course, I will make a Speech to the people in the Court-yard. You shall then doe, answered the Queene, according to my wishes. We must be speedy in execution of what we intend, before Commindorix hath notice to crosse our designes. He sendeth out therfore a Cryer thorow the whole City, who should gather the people together to heare the Kings Speech in businesse concerning the State. The people thought they had bin mad: for who would imagine that the King would now come into the face of the world, and make a Speech, who for so many yeres had liued thus retyred from all businesse? What strange and sudden thing had hapned? These were incredible things to all, who being alike ignorant of the occasion, as it often hapneth in strange newes, they aske and guesse one to another. Some did not stick to say, that the King would shew this his last royall power, in deliuering vp his Crowne in this assembly: all their desires were ready, and they flocked together in great multitudes. The Garrison- Souldiers being sent for, stood ready by their Companies, and vnder their colours; now there was raysed a high place like a Stage, to which after his Queene Timandra in a Chayre of State, they placed Astioristes next to them, the people discoursed diuersly of them. Some shed teares at the sight of the King: others questioned why the King raysed so suddenly to the height of honour, a strange Youth. And Britomandes often commanding silence, at length thus spake: It is fit that both you  & I my selfe, my deare Subiects, should giue the gods thanks, that they haue giue me a Son, & Successor to the Crown. This Youth which you see placed by me, was borne of the Queene, but being borne, he was concealed for feare of our enemies, & nursed abroad as a poore mans childe, and afterward lost & found againe by the contrariety of Fortune: yet this is the first day that I knew him for my childe, neyther did I thinke it fit to deferre any of your common ioy and content. But that all might be made partakers of this fulnesse of gladnesse, hee promised to the Souldiers a largesse, and to ease their Cities and Townes of the third part of their Customes and Subsidies; so they would shew their loyalty like faithfull and valiant Subiects, and would second the occasion the gods had now offered to settle France in assured tranquillity. Afterwards Astioristes , by the command of the King, made a speech to the Commons and Souldiers. Hee was acceptable to all before, and then they seemed to haue a farre greater opinion of him, by this accession of Fortune: hee further obliged the Souldiers, by promising them a largesse next day, and to the people, whom the promise of lessening their Imposts and Taxes had made gentle (for Commindorix had cunningly, to make the King odious, raysed them very high;) hee promised further a Dole and a Feast. In these strange and difficult businesses, the chiefe Nobility were a great helpe to draw the affection of the people, who were then with the King and Lieutenants of the traynd Souldiers, but almost all borne of Noble houses. The people therefore filled the ayre with acclamations, the Souldiers betooke themselues to their armes, and the whole company agreed to this fortune with a tractable and sudden willingnesse, as the inconstant vulgar sort vse to doe: onely the Fauourites of Commindorix grew heartlesse, as it were at the ruin of their Master, or trusting in his power, silently threatned such as were actors in his absence. But they were too weake for the multitude, who being then valiant out of danger, afterwards were cast downe with sudden feare: for Commindorix in the midd'st of this combustion entred the City, being warned by some of his followers, which brought him newes that there was some great matter in hand, as soone as it was bruited that the King intended to make a Speech to the people. He comming in his hunting-clothes, sweating for anger and haste, after he saw the people flocke together, and done, but as if he could haue suppressed all things well enough with his frowne, hee ascendeth to the King, no body hindring him in his way, being as much reuerenced and feared by reason of his continuall tyranny, as hated and enuyed. He is willingly receyued through the people, who were now silent, as fearing that they had offended. In his hand hee held his hunting-Iauelin, and his Sword hung by his side; few of his houshold-seruants followed him, his haste being such, and those especially armed with small Darts: and now he was come to the higher end of the roome where some of the Nobility stood about the King; there roughly entring; What presumption is this, quoth hee? or who hath wronged the King and Weale-publique in my absence, by raysing seditious tumults? All trembled for feare, by very custome of seruitude, and obedience: and there seemed to be little helpe in the King: onely Astioristes stood dantlesse, and presently went to meet him; and putting him aside lightly with his hand, hee commanded him to cast away his weapons, and goe more modestly to the King, whom he saw in his Chayre. Commindorix eagerly fretted in himselfe, that any should be so bold with him, and in his hot bloud, lest hee should goe vnreuenged, cast his Iauelin at the face of Astioristes : Hee stooping, auoyded it, and the Dart light amongst the Pretorian Souldiers. Both of them then drew their swords. Perhaps, my Guest, our age hath not shewed so memorable a sight; which that it might now also delight you, imagine in your minde what a combate it was: what roome soeuer was about the Court, the souldiers  & the people (who had also such weapons as the French vsed to weare) had incompassed round about. The Nobility, which were sent for by Timandra , stood vpon the Stage which did beare the Kings Throne; the King and Queene sate higher in Chayres of State: yet no body offred to set forward or hinder the combate, when they saw Astioristes and Commindorix first draw their swords. There was a deepe silence: each mans eyes and thoughts bent vpon this combate, as if all had shaken with some fatall feeblenesse; for by the successe hereof euery one expected his owne fortune; and all did so grieue or wish happinesse, as if their bloud had bin let runne with the edges of their Swords, and many thought that the gods stood there as Iudges of their combate, and they should giue sentence of the difference, that is, of Astioristes his birth. If hee were not brought to the Kingdome by the imposture of false cunning, the gods would neuer suffer, that hee should now fall in the top of his meritorious happinesse, who had beene preserued from so many wonderfull dangers. And the very presence of the combatants stirred the affection of many, and distracted their seuerall well-wishes: for Commindorix was taller then most men; his limbes were strong, and not vnequall to his talnesse; he had a sterne countenance, and was now at his full strength of yeeres, accounted he was valiant, and skilfull in his weapons and wrestling. On the other side, in not so tall as his Enemies shoulder: Hee had a face like a Maide, though then wrinkled with threats, a comely presence; and good men did pitty him, because he had to doe with an experienced Champion, who often had proued Conqueror. But their weapons were alike, both of them had swords; neyther did at the first assault. In disdaine therefore, he prepares himselfe as to an easie conquest. But after his thrust is put by, which he had made at his face, and could hardly auoyd Astioristes his blade from his throat, then he began to looke more narrowly to him, and to stand vpon his owne skill and guard. And now both their Swords twice or thrice did fall in vaine, when at length Astioristes receyued a wound in his head vpon the top of the fore- head; but then being more beautifull by sweat and bloud, hee waxed impatiently angry, trauersed his ground, came on, and gaue backe, tyring his Enemy with change of play. The honour of the victory, & reward, did presse on the noble Youth, knowing that the Crowne of France should be the recompence of his conquest; but especially piety moued him, that hee might settle his new-found Parents in their Throne. So Fortune at length fauoured him, pressing on his enemy, that fighting as our custome was with blowes, by chance he directed a stroke at the head of his enemy, which the turning of his head could not altogether preuent: for his Sword light vpon Commindorix his eare, which, with a little piece of his cheeke, fell to the ground. The Tyrant shooke his head, and being full of choller  & indignation, muttered to himselfe. This chance gaue him the doome and punishment of theeues: and much bloud trickled downe from him; and this increased his rage, because Astioristes (as if in contempt of his enemy, had sufficient leisure to spend a iest) aggrauated the paine of his wound with a scoffe. The combate therefore waxed more desperate, vntill Astioristes seemed to scorne that the victory was deferred so long. It was a happy blow, and happy for France , which cut off Commindorix his arme; which falling off, the Conquerour came in, and opened a way for his life-blood, which was yet doubtfull to leaue the body. showted in the Theater at the fall of a Sword-player. Presently me thinkes, quoth hee, Gobrias , I now see your Astioristes , how he behaued himselfe to the King, Queene, and the spectators, his enemie being vanquished, and he dignified by that paines and danger, how gloriously he swelled with ioy and this good fortune, as long as he carried in his hand his naked sword as yet reeking in his enemies blood. I delight, Gobrias to dwell vpon so pleasant thoughts. But what thought the people and Souldiers, after acclamations, praises and thanksgiuing; and presently the Souldiers, by night, the Citizens crowned with Lawrell, danced about their bone-fires: there was no discourse in their streets, but contempt of the Tyrant, and praises of such as were in Verse, because they were tuneable, we haue made account of. Our Poet here amongst the rest (and withall he pointed at the Druide ) hath not refrained his penne vpon the same Argument: which, that we may reioyce afresh, if you please to entreat him, he, as he is most courteous, will recite. Arsidas hearing him say so, more that hee might not seeme to neglect the Druide's inuention, then that hee desired to haue this discourse interrupted by verses, earnestly looked vpon the Poet, and obtained of him, which did not much refuse, that he recited, and almost sung these Verses:  Which shall we praise of th' heauenly Powers? Whose Altar shall we strow with flowres? To all the gods this praise of ours Is due; for no one god could bring Freedome to France and such a King, Highly deseruing. By many gods this Tiran: dead Ivpiter Thunder, Mars his Speare Aym'd at him, and Apollo there Let fly his Arrowes. Then all those gods would present be, And lend, braue Prince, their strength to thee; While thou from bondage sad dost free Thy Countrey; France her Persevs Thee calls; and freed, does thee her Spouse Gladly acknowledge. O day, too good to end in night! A Youth durst with a Giant fight, Whil'st he thy beardlesse checkes does slight, As speckled Pytmon , whose scald hide Seem'd arrow-proofe, did long deride Beardlesse Apollo . Thou, Natures darling, her right eye, Braue Youth, thy Parents gratifie, With Nephews, thy faire Progeny, Whether Avrora shall thee wed, Or Cynthia bright in her chaste bed, Make thee a Father.  The courtesie of Astioristes towards Aneroestvs . His voyage in an vnknowne habit. How he had taken the name of Poliarchvs . A suddaine feare and ioy betweene Arsidas and Gobrias .  hee, I will not trouble you with a tedious discourse, what ordinances the Druides and men at Armes made in honour of the Princes; how many daies in prayer they spent, and how the people flocked to their Churches and Temples: finally, how all agreed vpon peace, some willingly, others for feare, (which could not be almost hoped for in that great faction of Commindorix .) Because the night is farre spent, my Guest, and we haue tyred you with discourse, in a few words I will lead Astioristes to these our times; who made the first proofe of his power, not in excesse of pleasure, or pride of his new-gain'd honour, but in bounty, and religious loue. He calls to the Court Cerovistvs and Sicambre , vnder whom he was nursed and bred: and he bestowed on Cerovistvs the Stewardship of his houshold, beeing accustomed to such businesse as did become the Master of a Family. He preferred Sicambre to his Mother, who was shortly aduanced to be one of her chiefest women. He made their Sonne, who was also called Cerovistvs , one of his especiall Fauourites and friends; with whom he now renewed that old league of loue and familiarity, as when they did vse to play together. But the most remarkeable note of his religious loue was obserued towards Talents he promised for him being a child and a Captiue, pearced his gratefull heart; and Timandra was delighted, that her Sonne did so much bewayle the hard distresse of that King; she knowing by her owne deserts, how much more she her selfe should bee beloued. We both therefore erected an honourable Tombe for Aneroestvs , and proclaimed warre against the Tyrants who possessed his Kingdome. This deuotion of the young Prince towards his old friend Aneroestvs , fell happy for our Kingdome; for the enemy being vanquished, the Countrey and Lands heeretofore gouerned by Aneroestvs became ours. Astioristes himselfe waged this warre, and within sixe moneths, he gained for his Father the strongest Castles in the Alpes, and what Fortresses there were in those Countries; that afterwards there proued no Prouince more faithful to vs. After he had subdued Aneroestvs his aduersaries, yet houering ouer their booty, some in the Battell, the rest in pursuite, he returned to his Father with great triumph. In this happinesse, he ruled three yeeres after Commindorix his death, vnder his Fathers authority, Britomandes confirming whatsoeuer he commanded: from him did the Magistrates and Souldiers receiue their charge; the Noble-men were promoted, or if they deserued, displaced by him. In him abroad and at home. She had had only three children, the eldest brought safety to his Family; the third was a Daughter, six yeeres younger than Astioristes ; the gods haue preserued her hitherto, she liueth vnparallel'd for beauty and vertue; wee call her Cyrthea . In these two children did Timandra put all her felicity: and now the forgetfulnesse of past calamities possessed all; when Astioristes altered the course, I thinke, by the Fates appointment: he determined to trauell, without any traine or companions, with a desire to know what Countries and what men were out of France: he spake of Hercvles and Thesevs , and so many Heroes out of the farthest East, who gained immortall praise by seeking aduentures by such a life: and he said, how by that power in which hee liued in the Court, that some ill-disposed people might thinke, he had not so much helpt his Father to his Kingdome, as opprest him by another captiuity. But he had other businesse, and more priuate, as I thinke, which made him fancy this course of trauell. Calling therefore together the Nobles, who admired the strangenesse of his new-intended voyage, hee told them, that for a while hee would leaue his parents and his Kingdome to their protection: That he had made his vowes to the gods farre distant from France , which he must pay in their owne Temples. But lest they should grieue at this his resolution, or should foretell ill fortune in his Iourney by their sorrow, he told them, he made no question but to returne safe, both by the prouidence of his owne Countrey gods, and the religion of his vowing to forraigne ones. But when we strongly opposed his resolution,  & mingled sighes and teares with our prayers; he seemed willingly to be perswaded, that giuing vs hope of yeelding to our requests, we might not so earnestly and violently intreate him. But suddenly the same night hee left the Court, hauing onely one Companion in his secret and dangerous iourney, which was the Sonne of Cerovistvs and Sicambre , whom he had of a long time made partaker both of his sports and more serious affaires. Although they lately returned, it is not yet knowne whither they went, where they liued, what dangers they passed, or what their actions were, they are so trusty and secret in concealing their trauels. Then how wee stood amazed through feare and griefe! What did the people thinke? How did the Nobles looke, after it was knowne that Astioristes was gone? Men went as if they were lunaticke, searching all waies  & Ports, if any where they could find him, or stop his passage. In conclusion, Timandra onely hindred vs from despairing after some few dayes, alledging, that she had receiued Letters of the health and safety of her Sonne. And not then onely, but afterwards shee told vs, shee heard from him vpon euery occasion; whether shee spake this from her heart, or onely to refresh their wearied thoughts with this small comfort. All men complained of the Prince, who would leaue a Kingdome, to trauell, no man knew whither; that when Britomandes was dead, it was almost more mournfull than the Kings Funerall, to heare the people calling Astioristes home to the safety of his Countrey. But in the meane time businesses were to be dispatcht, and Timandra assured her of the life and safety of her Sonne; and therefore vntill his returne, the gouernment of the Common-weale was committed to her. They only withstood her, who would haue beene glad if not liuing; and they were bold to alledge, how that the Queene was not to be endured, which should seeke after the gouernment, fit for a King onely. So they easily grew into Factions; most tooke part with the Queene; a cousin germane to Commindorix drew the rest. The Factions grew so hot, that there were Garisons by Land and Sea. There was an especiall care for the Nauy, because the Enemies would thinke it a conquest, to driue out Timandra from Marselles ; and shee had drawne thither her shipping and Gallies, for the defence of the Towne and Hauen, when behold, Astioristes returned in good time, wee extremely longing for him; and now ouercome with ioy, scarce could beleeue the gods, Fortune, or our own eyes. It comforted them to touch him as he passed by them, and often to looke vpon him. All sorts of people, and of all ages, came out of their houses and Townes to meete him; and more apparent signes of gladnesse could not receiue a triumphant Conquerour out of the Battell. Then without delay, the seditious people laid downe their weapons; and he is welcomed King by the generall voyce of all: but because his raigne should not begin in blood, hee proclaimed pardon to all offenders whatsoeuer, to that very day. And he was so much the gladder, that forces were gathered together and in readinesse, he said that it was not vnaduisedly done, or for any ill to France : but that the prouidence of the gods had prepared this Army for such imployment as hee had appointed. Being therefore crowned according to his Countrey fashion, hee committed the gouernment of the Weale publike to Timandra , while he imployeth himselfe a while in the warres; for hee had enemies in Greece , and he would there employ his forces. Then he shippeth the choyse of his Army; and in the meane time, while he putteth out to Sea, hee commandeth me to lanch out with some few shipping, and scowre the Seas, especially those betweene Liguria and Sardinia . Hauing performed his command, and viewed the Coast, I sayled more slowly, determining to tarry for him now comming. By his countenance and speech, you shall find, my Guest, that I haue beene sparing in the praises of so great a King. But since a great part of Sicily is inhabited by the Grecians , and hee especially passed by the Townes belonging to them; tell me now truely, whether you haue knowne Astioristes by his fauour or report. Now Arsidas trusting more to his own hope,  & fixing his eyes vpon the ground, after he had pondered a while all things in his mind; I haue knowne, saith hee, none such by the name of Astioristes , but, it may bee, by some other name: but if he went by any other, I would willingly know him. haue heard himselfe say; that the concealing of himselfe vnder a meaner fortune, might gaine him security. He was there (said he) called , whose name indeed is Cerovistvs , after his Fathers name. Arsidas seemed to shake at the report hereof; whom when Gobrias perceiued thus astonished and distracted with excessiue gladnesse, he began also to bee in expectation of the occasion of his suddaine ioy, vntill he thus said: What god hath deliuered me into thy hands a most happy Captiue? I had wandred truely by your coasts, and in my fruitlesse wishes had enquired after Poliarchvs for I haue such businesse to him, as, if he liue, I must needs know. O happy people, in so worthy a King! O the fortunate dayes of France ! To whom will not the terrour of your name come! How will forraigne Princes and Kingdomes labour to make alliance and leagues with you? And euen this reioyceth me, that I see you floting on the Sea with an Army, although I know it is not for fight, but for triumph: for your enemies had rather see such forces, than make tryall of them. But I must presently be brought to the speech of the King, whom, as a priuate man, I haue entertained in mine owne house. Gobrias hearing this, vsing Arsidas more respectfully, by degrees enquired of him, what was his businesse, and from whence he came. But Arsidas wisely vsing lesse speech after his heedlesse violence of ioy, was much troubled, because he had rashly confessed, that hee vnderstood the whole businesse, when Auoyding therfore the questions which Gobrias did further vrge him with, hee began importunately to desire, that he might be conueyed to Poliarchvs in a nimble sayler. Then wee will stay the course (quoth Gobrias ) of our Nauy, my Guest, not only by taking downe their sayles, but by casting Anchor, if possible we may: so, without all doubt, the Admirall, wherein the King is, because I know her to be no slow sayler, will come vp to vs this night: but if he commeth not by the next morning, I will presently send out a Galley, and the strongest Oares, which may carry you. In the meane time, take your rest in this Ship, and command no lesse then amongst your dearest friends. After this complement, hee left him to his rest, and he himselfe lyeth in the next bed, although their extreme ioy admitted little quiet: and Arsidas amongst the rest much wondred, why Argenis did not forewarne him, that Poliarchvs his true name was Astioristes : which as often as the Lady called to mind, that she had neglected, (earnest desire is easily troubled) she presumeth to prophesie by her owne feares, that Arsidas will misse of him.  The description of a Tempest. Gobrias his Fleete scattered. They are driuen into Africa . The counsell and resolution of Arsidas and  were at their rest. There was one only, the Master of the Admirall, who suspected much the weather, and the nature of the Cliffes which lye aside from Liguria , beeing well experienced, that they are accustomed to cast downe with great violence from the tops of their high-diuided Hills, great stormes of wind  & raine, with suddaine gusts into the Sea. He warned therefore the Mariners to be watchfull, and being carefull in all seasons, he verily expected some ensuing danger. About midnight the weather changed, when the wind did rise from the Mountaines, which playing at the first with a kind of whistling, with the gables of the Masts of the Ships, made the calme Sea afterwards to swell, and by the thicknesse of the Clouds, to darken the Skie. The Mariners began to hinder one the other by their sudden haste; and making an outcry among themselues, with the roaring of the Sea, they seemed to second the winds terrour. Gobrias was awakened, and he might see by the Master of the Ship his countenance, how neere they were to great danger. And now one began to aduise,  & euery one to comand; that the hurly-burly of such as were vnskilfull in Sea-busines, was like to bring no lesse danger than the storms violence. The waues growing black, by casting vp thick sand in the depth of the darksome night, could not be seene, but when with a fierce encounter, dashing, as it were, the enraged water against the ships ribs, it flew vp like sparkles, and then fell downe againe: onely the foming of the Seas froth shined in the darke, which often, with a most fearefull rage, beating ouer the sides of the Ships, gaue light in the midst of the Deckes. They durst not trust to their Anchors, because they had not roome to play with the fury of the waues: then another feare troubled them, lest their Galleys should fall foule, their gables fayling. At length, the storme exceeded the Mariners skil; for they could neither stay their course, nor cast anchor. They began to run whither the winds violence draue them, leauing some sayles to the sayle-yard, by which the Ships, in those vnconstant surges, might be somewhat poysed. The night thus spent, the next day was nothing fairer, being darkned with violent stormes, and the vgly shape of imminent danger. The tempestuous fury continued the night following; but when the day appeared, the strength of the storme waxed weaker: and now they knew not the Coast nor the Seas; and taking a view of their Nauy, they complained, that the best part was missing, or cast away. But when they were somewhat assured of their safety, they had leisure to thinke of other things which troubled them; they began to speake of Poliarchvs his danger: When should they enioy his presence; or where should they seeke him, perhaps cast vpon dangerous and vnknowne shores? Finally, where were they themselues; or what Hauen should they enter their Ships, being split, wanting Timber, Pitch, and a secure Port? so great hope, he knew not whether he should wander in his search now by Land or Sea. That he must now no more seeke for France or the Rhone , but trauell thorow all Countries at randome; search all Ports and Hauens, whither the Tempest might driue Poliarchvs . He asked where should he now haue a Ph aeacian ship, which, without the helpe of a Pilot, might carry him in his determined voyage? Could not Argenis reckon the dayes, who would account him a Traitour, if hee returned without her Poliarchvs ? For although feared, lest being weather-beaten, he would cast anchor in some Hauen, or sayle more slowly, vntill the time were expired, in which Argenis should looke for him. While he was in these meditations, and almost chiding ripe with Gobrias for his vnfortunate stay, which hindred him in his voyage to Poliarchvs , the Mariners bring word, how they thought they had descried Land, which seemed a farre offlike Clouds or a darke mist. Whatsoeuer it were, Gobrias commanded them to shape their course that way. When they had rowed with all their might, about noone they tooke in some, whom they had sent after the Tempest, to scowre the Seas, and discouer what the storme had done, and where they were. By these they are assured, that they touch on Africa , but that the Coast was dangerous, by reason of the shelues that were couered; and that Numidia was not farre off. There was at hand a Harbour not much frequented, and doubtfull whether there were safe riding for their Fleet: but necessity made them runne that hazzard, and thinke it safer than the Seas tyranny. They therefore that had beene sent before to discouer the Coast, led them the way to shore; and leauing a few with their ships, who should gather together the dispersed Fleet, by the great mercy of the gods, all that were absent of was well, all safe, and no ship lost. And the Inhabitants thereabouts most ciuilly relieued them, with dryed fishes, and such prouision as their pouerty accustomed them to eate themselues. But the storme fauoured not the Fleet which Poliarchvs himselfe led. His owne confidence had iustly filled his thoughts with Sicily , reuenge, and his deare Mistris. Why should Meleander now refuse him to bee his Sonne- in-law, shewing himselfe now a King, by his habit, and the magnificence of his wealth and forces? He durst now scorne Radirobanes, Archombrotvs , or any other Riuall, if they would try him hand to hand, or in set battell. Hee hopes besides, either to abrogate by the sword, that Law of Sicily, which forbiddeth the Heire of the Crowne to be married to a greater Kingdome, or to giue it a new construction; That Sicily indeed should not fall to the Crowne of France , but should liue according to their ancient Lawes and Customes; and if Argenis had many children, this should bee settled vpon the second. As he was thus thinking, he imagined, their Sayles were slow, and their Oares lazie: he went therefore to the Rowers seates, and chid the Oares, when this storme came forceably vpon them, and alters their course which they had intended. Although hee himselfe was of a dauntlesse spirit, yet when hee saw the billows fearefully dancing about him, and, as it were, threatning his death; yet he gaue this to his Mother and Mistris, that he feared to dye for their sakes. He exhorts them therfore, astonisht with the violence of the storme, that they should shew their best skill, and not feare danger in his most vgly shape: that the Destinies had prouided for him a more glorious fate, than to bee buried at these yeeres in the Sea. Although hee had made them laborious in their seuerall offices, with these comfortable speeches, yet they could preuaile but little against the impetuous billowes, vntill the Nauy driuen to the view of a strange coast, the Seas asswaged. But then the Oares were no longer able to endure fresh labour; nor the weake ribs of the Ships, beaten with the rushing waues, could longer abide the Sea. This was irkesome to capitall to himselfe and Argenis . Yet the opinion of the Mariners, and feare of shipwracke ouerswayed him: for he began to be carefull of himselfe for Argenis her sake. Hee willed them therefore to put in on the next shore, if they could find where the Ships might safely ride.  Radirobanes his designe vpon Africa . Archombrotvs his Letters.  Countrey; but hee found it to bee a pleasant Soyle, by the multitude of Trees, and the fruitfull Hills by the shore side: and there was much shipping for fishing and other trading, lying at anchor. They therfore set out some in a Pinnace, to enquire what Countrey it was: who presently brought word to the place vpon the top of the Decke; O Gelanorvs , (saith he) hast thou knowne this Riuer? Dost thou know this City Lixa? Dost thou know the Queenes Palace on the top of the Hill? This is that Mauritania with whom we haue League; This is the Kingdome of that most illustrious Queene Hyanisbe : the Destinies haue not beene altogether our enemies, who haue cast vs, weather-beaten and Strangers, vpon a friendly shore. But lest wee should affright them vnawares, by the suddaine comming of a Nauy, go first to the Queene; tell her what chance hath driuen mee hither, and intreat a safe harbour for our Nauy; in the meane time wee will houer here-abouts. The rumour presently was spred amongst the Souldiers and Mariners, that the Land which they saw was a friends Countrey, ready to receiue Poliarchvs with no lesse courtesie than if hee were at home, and that his men and Nauy should be no lesse secure. Reioycing therfore at the newes, they easily beleeued, what they earnestly desired: and after they had the word giuen, with a ioyfull shout and acclamation, they cast Anchor: for they would not goe into the Harbour, before the Queene had giuen her allowance. But now the outrage of an vnexpected multitude tooke away from Gelanorvs that security which he hoped for, as he entred the Hauen in his nimble-sayling Pinnace; because the coast swarmed with shipping and armed men, and filled the shore with great astonishment. The reason of this suddaine vproare was, because they had descried Poliarchvs a farre off with his Fleete: For they had intelligence of a Nauy prepared, (neither did the report deceiue them) to inuade their Countrey. Then, imagining this to bee the same, they ranne to their defucee, full of feare. As yet there were but few Souldiers mustered, and not many ships manned, (for the newes of the ensuing warre, and the danger thereof, was lately spred abroad.) The chiefe of this confusion, were Citizens, who in a hare-braine commotion incompassed with their thicke Boats from their Enemy which was neere at hand, and vnder that pretence, a Spie. Although hee was troubled in mind, yet he often answered them, He was a friend, and a sure Confederate, and deserued neither to be feared nor ill intreated: finally, that he came as a messenger from Poliarchvs to the Queene. By good fortune, there was one present who knew him, not many moneths before leauing this Countrey with his Lord Poliarchvs , not without the great esteeme and fauour of the Queene Hyanisbe . The people therefore being better settled in their thoughts, began to aske questions of the Fleet, which was within kenne. He assured them, that these were no enemies to Africa , but Poliarchvs onely with his forces. So landing, he is led to the Queene, whom he so comforted, being affrighted with the conceit of the present warre, that shee did not so much imagine Poliarchvs to haue arriued there, as the defensiue gods of Africa . She sent presently some of her Nobles to inuite Poliarchvs on shore: she her selfe often questioning of Gelanorvs , of what Countrey Poliarchvs was King; against whom hee bended his forces; or for what purpose he before concealed himselfe vnder a priuate habit. Gelanorvs well apprehending what was to be concealed, and what expressed, cheered vp the Queenes heart with sweet speeches, that shee would hardly suffer him to returne to his Lord, to beare backe newes of his courteous entertainment. It was now fine dayes since the Queen her selfe had hardly taken sustenance, being full of cares and inward griefe. For as soone as Radirobanes returned to Calaru , after his shamelesse attempt against Argenis , thinking vpon the discredit of his Enterprizes, he feared to find the reuerence of his Subiects to him lessened, knowing that the minds of the people and Souldiers are such, as that they esteeme of their Princes by their successe; that prosperous men haue that accounted their vertue which is their fortune, and contempt follows actions not successfull; that they might not therefore spend words of him in their idlenesse, and that he might refresh his disquiet mind with the taste of new businesse, he bended his studies againe to warre: yet he would not returne presently into Sicily ; because, assuring himselfe that they expected him there, hee considered how they were in full preparation for his comming. Hee intended rather to picke out some, against whom in the meane time he might bend his forces, while both his fresh Souldiers might be the better disciplin'd; and after the Sicilians growing neglectfull by delay, he might vnawares set vpon Meleander . Neither wanted there an occasion of new warre, according to his desires: for it was long since he purposed to inuade Mauritania , and this was the reason that he rigged his Nauy, which afterwards the surmized hope of obtayning Argenis and Sicily , turned as a more iust warre against But then the old grudges against Mauritania came againe into his minde; and besides, there seemed new occasions offered: for by chance, some Mauritanian Pyrats, no lesse troublesome to their owne Countrey-men, then to Strangers, had robbed certaine Sardinian Merchants, and he returning out of Sicily , gladly heard the complaint of his robbed Subiects; and presently, as if this iniury had beene offered by the common consent of the Mauritanians; hee sendeth to the Queene Hyanisbe , not onely demands restitution, but commands due punishment for their offence. Shee sends backe answer, That they were not taken by her will, and that the Offendors were not in her power to punish, or that shee did acknowledge them for Subiects: The Sardinians should lay hold on the Offendors, wheresoreuer they could finde them; and that she would helpe what shee could, to apprehend them. Radirobanes framing the answer of the Queene, of purpose to the Sardinians , to an ill construction, seemed to be much inraged; that she Sardinians were slighted by the Africans , and their complaints were of small regard, because hee had not added threats to them. As if therefore the League had beene sufficiently broken, hee was resolued not onely to reuenge himselfe for the Merchants, but to renew the old quarrell of his Predecessors with the Queene of Mauritania : for the ancient Kings of Sardinia had made often warre vpon the Mauritanians for the right of that Kingdome. But afterwards truce or treaties of peace suppressed these differences (which now and then, according to the pleasure of both Kings) as if they wakened from sleepe, they couered their desire of warre, vnder the shew of iustice. And then it pleased Radirobanes so to imploy his forces which he had brought backe furious out of Sicily : and hee promised to himselfe the easier victory, for that a Woman ruled in Mauritania . Yet that this vnlawfull desire of warre might seeme to be iust, he prepareth in Herald at Armes, who should proclaime Warre, while he leuyeth fresh forces presently in Sardinia . And when the Herald came to Lika , admitted to Queene of an Embassadour, that his Master would with all his power inuade her Countrey, and lay his clayme to her Kingdome, if shee did not instantly surrender vp her Crowne to him, and acknowledge him Soueraigne. The Queene affrighted with this suddaine misery, yet made him a speedy answer: That it was basely done of Radirobanes ; to thinke to vndoe a Woman, and that shee thought hee durst not try his forces against a Man: it was likewise perfidious dealing, to violate so many yeeres peace, especially vpon no occasion, and not being any way wronged: that the gods cannot be deluded; men also will be ready to assist her: neyther was there onely one Tomiris , which knew to giue bloud to such as thirsted after it. The Herald departing from her, when he stood on the Shore, holding a Speare in his right hand, thus spoke: Because the Mauritanians haue wronged the State of the Sardinians , and, being admonished, haue not reformed their insolency, and because the Sardinian King and his Subiects haue proclaymed warre against the Queene and people of Mauritania : for this cause I the King and people of Sardinia , doe proclayme and make warre against the Mauritanian Queene and her Subiects: and hauing solemnely made proclamation, hee casteth his Iauelin into the Enemies Countrey, and being receiued into his Ship, hee presently returned backe to King Radirobanes . Some of her chiefe friends were so bold to blame Hyanisbe , that shee would suffer her Sonne to be absent, vpon whom the charge of the Warre should depend: for they did therefore lye more open to Radirobanes , and that hee came to inuade, as it were, an empty Kingdome, and despised that Army which a male Prince did not leade. But she replyed, That it was rather by fortune then any fault of hers, that her quiet and calme gouernement should be thus troubled with an vnexpected storme of warre. Yet notwithstanding her Sonne was not farre off, and would immediately returne vpon the receit of her Letters which she intended to send to him. In the meane time, let Souldiers be leuyed, and no carefull diligence be wanting which the times doe require. Two dayes were hardly past ouer their heads, when it was reported to her Nobility, which were in Councell about these businesses, that one of her Sonnes seruants (for he had carryed but two with him) was arriued at the Court. All stood amazed when they heard it; and the comfort seemed not vnlike the fancy of a tale, that one should come in the very instant of time, who should bring certaine newes of the health of the Prince, and should tell them whither they might send for him. But this was the occasion of the sending of his seruant: After Archombrotvs perceyued that nothing was wanting towards the marriage of Argenis , but the consent of his Mother, lest it should be a delay to his ioyfull proceedings, he sent her a seruant with such Letters, as a young man and a Louer, yet not forgetfull of his Mothers authority, could write. And Hyanisbe was his Mother, and hee was called Hyempsall amongst his owne people. But, by his Mothers command, trauelling into Greece , and dissembling his birth, he tooke vpon him a came agreeable for that Countrey. In his Letters he expressed the great duety he had shewed to his Mother in the faithfull concealing of his birth, according to her command: yet the happinesse which was offered, exceeded all desires; his allyance with a most wealthy King; the Kingdome of Sicily , and the young Princesse, whose naturall gifts excelled her inheritance. He intreated her, that shee would giue him leaue to reiterate the greatnesse of his birth to a King, whom he had so much pleased, being a Stranger and vnknowne: and that she would send some of her prime Nobility to his marriage, with treasure and prouision, which might giue a commendation of Mauritania to the Sicilians , like to become his Subiects.  The Queene much troubled at her Sonnes Letters, Shee writeth to him. Report that Argenis is marryed.  the reading thereof, shee was so abashed, that they which were present, suspecting some ill newes of the Princes health, inquired of the Seruant, what newes hee had brought should make the Queene looke so sad. But he assured them, that Hyempsall was not onely in health, but renowned amongst Strangers. Hyanisbe also imagining that others were afraid by her countenance, pluckt vp her spirits, and told them, that by the helpe of the gods, her Sonne was in health, and would shortly returne into his owne Countrey. But as soone as she was in priuate with the Seruant which brought the Letters: I thinke (quoth shee) that my Sonne hath giuen you a sufficient charge, that you reueale to no man in what Countrey hee liueth: and I pray you be you trusty herein: for I would not haue it disclosed to any: and you must presently, as soone as it is day, depart hence to him. You haue beene so faithfull, that I need not tell you how much you haue deserued of both of vs. After shee had thus deliuered her minde, she retyred her selfe into her priuate Closet, no lesse troubled in her thoughts about her Sonnes request, then Radirobanes his iniuries. What a storme of troubles (quoth she) doe suddenly fall vpon mee? Should I at once feare the allyance of Sicily , and the threatned  & imminent war of Sardinia? And must thou, my dearest Sonne, be Sonne-in-law to Meleander? Why did I rashly send thee into that Countrey, which will be the occasion of vndoing thee, and that most Noble Lady? Forgiue, you gods, what I haue deserued by mine owne folly. Shall So, being much perplexed, she taketh Inke and Paper, and writeth to this effect:  differ from our present fortunes. The Herald of Sardinia was hardly gone out of my sight, proclayming warre against vs from Radirobanes, when I receiued thy Letters, which declared to mee, how neere thou wert to an vnseasonable marriage. I reioyce at thy good fortune and worth, which hath brought to passe, that Meleander should thinke thee worthy to be his Sonne-in-law, not knowing thy birth or fortunes. But thou wilt staine thy honour, if thou giuest way to thy loue, and sufferest thy Mother and Countrey to be a prey to the turbulent King Radirobanes . Doe not preferre Sicily , which thou shalt haue as a portion to thy natiue Countrey Africa : which thou wilt hardly inioy in peace, except thou presently returnest hither. Thou knowest how much easier it is to defend a Countrey, then gaine it when it is lost. After thou hast settled thy Mother in peace, and triumphed ouer thine Enemy, and the renowne of thy singular duetie, thou mayest returne, more deseruing those Allyances, and more worthy her loue. But thou shalt not thinke, the delay of that marriage which I forbid by a Mothers command, is onely for thou speakest not with mee, before thou marry Argenis . Returne presently to thy deare Mother. Thou shalt finde matter of gladnesse, and a great reward of thy duetie in this, that thou hast obeyed my command: for it doth so much concerne thee that thou know my minde before the marriage, and that I reueale to thee some secret which cannot be trusted to Paper or Messenger, that if thou neglectest thy duetie, I will deny my selfe to be thy Mother. I will take and as it were spoyles, whom thou hast killed with griefe. Now I hope, this will be command sufficient for thee: I know thy good disposition, which no trauell or fortune can change. But lest thou shouldest thinke mee obstinately bent against all thy demands, I deny not but that thou mayest discouer thy selfe to the King of Sicily , that thou art my Sonne. If hee desireth thou should'st bee his Sonne-in-law, if hee will bestow Sicily on thee with his Daughter, let him send a sufficient power with thee to withstand the inuasion of the Sardinians : I will giue thee leaue presently to returne into Sicily , after I shall make proofe here that thou art my sonne, and Radirobanes his enemy. Farewell.  When she had deliuered her Letter, written to this purpose, to her seruant, she willed him by word of mouth, that he should perswade her Sonne to make no stay before hee came into Africa ; and that hee should haue an especiall care of these Letters which shee had deliuered to him. The seruant promised to fulfill her command in all things; yet he was hindered two dayes by the violence of a tempest, and had scarcely weighed Anchor, when Gelanorvs brought newes that Poliarchvs was comming. But then Hyanisbe alledging, that there were friends come with succors, not without the prouidence of the gods, taketh care to receiue Poliarchvs on the shore with all princely intertainement. And she her selfe met him as hee was comming nigh to the Court. The remembrance of his former courtesie, and the necessitie of his present ayde, which shee did expect from him, made her double her courteous intertainement. She discoursed with him, as if hee had beene her sonne; but that she added reuerence to her kinde speeches. Neyther did hee ill deserue it, being so humble towards the Queene, and behauing himselfe with so well-fashioned modesty, that all the company with applause did in their best wishes commend them to the gods, as mother and sonne. And there were some appoynted on the shore to intertaine his Captaines and Souldiers. They were by all most friendly welcomed. The common cry of the Mauritanians was, that there were Forrainers come, nothing allyed to the Africans , desiring no pay, which would defend them against danger with their owne bloud. They therefore welcomed them comming, and euery one fairely intreated the Strangers, and met them at their doores with Wine and Garlands; that it was a wonder to the French , not knowing what courtesie the Africanes expected at their hands, that they should any where be better vsed, then in their owne France . But the Queene staying no longer, then while shee might leade Poliarchvs from the Gate into the Court, thus spake: Wee did not at first know you to be a King, most illustrious Sir: When you were lately here vnder a priuate habit, we beheld your worth with admiration, which no disguise of a meane fortune could cloake from inquisitiue eyes and iudgements. Then indeed you restored me to my selfe againe, when the Theeues had robbed mee almost of my soule, in taking away that Cabinet. But now, that makes good your fauours, whether it be of your owne free-will, or the prouidence of the gods, you haue landed here with your forces. Radirobanes , the Sardinian King, inuades my Countrey vnprouided, and growne secure by too much peace. We dayly expect his hostile Fleet. Neyther could wee gather together our Forces in so short a time. I am a Woman: my Sonne is absent; take you the protection of mee, and let it be your glory, not to despise the patronage of a Queene iniuriously assaulted: for I commit you to the charge of my whole Kingdome: onely stay heere some few dayes, to defend mee, that none may haue occasion to speake of Radirobanes his insolency, without mention of your valour: Whithersoeuer or whatsoeuer your haste may be, your stay will be excusable. Not onely her Maiesty, but her griefe, and almost teares falling from her eyes, graced her speech. And Poliarchvs was ashamed slowly to grant her request in such an extremity. But then againe, his sacred promise of loue, and the miserable and pittifull estate of Argenis , repelled the heat of his present willingnesse to this good office; vntill, greatly admiring that in Sicily , hee inquired where hee should now be resident. Whom after hee vnderstood to haue left Sicily , and to be in Sardinia , or to be sayling towards Africa , hee was in extreme feare, lest hauing surprized or obtayned question: And haue you heard any thing, saith he, whether he be Sonne-in-law to the King of Sicily? Hyanisbe , who was aduertized by Letters from her selfe what it should concerne Poliarchvs ) told him, that there was no such matter. But he, not knowing who had done him this courtesie, by what meanes Radirobanes was expulsed, or who did it, thought there was no such vrgent occasion why he should goe for Sicily so suddenly with his Army: for what could much trouble Argenis but Radirobanes? But it would be a perpetuall scandall to his honour, if he should forsake Hyanisbe , and (as it were) offer her vp to her Enemy. In the meane time, he would send some faithfull friend, who should comfort yet if this warre grew not sudden, but lingring, then, by the Queenes patience, he would leaue a sufficient Garrison in Mauritania , and depart from Africa , with part of his Army. Neyther was Radirobanes any small prouocation to his stay, meeting him at all times as a fatall enemy: and that hee would now reuenge, vnder the colour of ayding Hyanisbe , the iniuries which he had offered to Argenis . Vpon this premeditation, hee answered the Queene in this manner: Why should I keepe you in suspence by my being silent? Doe not beleeue, great Queene, that I made any scruple whether I should leaue you, that is , whether I could be more mischieuous than Radirobanes himselfe. But the wickednesse of this miscreant, whom I haue so long time hated, and my happy fortune, which so seasonably directed my trauels hither, incited me to make some abode with you: for know, most illustrious Queene, whether I consider your selfe, your cause, or your courtesie towards mee, I am so much your seruant, that I may deny you nothing. Seeing therefore you are in this danger, you haue mee at your disposing. Vse the power of my Kingdome, and know, that I will be no lesse than a Sonne to you, in doing you honour. Neyther, if I liue, shall Radirobanes escape vnpunished, for molesting  & prouoking you in the time of your Sonnes absence. This Language was so pleasing to Hyanisbe , and her Nobles, that most of them ranne into the Temples of their gods, to giue thanks with all kind of Incense, for Poliarchvs his happy comming. Neyther did Hyanisbe gain- say their forward Religion, but inuited Poliarchvs also to the Temple. The young Prince's Religion was moued by his owne late danger at Sea: insomuch, that willingly he approched to the Temple of the Africans , viewed it, and offered his vowes to their Deity. The Goddesse was made in the shape of a Virgin, whether it were Venvs , or Ivno , and borne vpon a Lyon, her lookes lifted vpwards, her body also, and her fore-feet so erected, as if shee were going vp into Heauen. The Assyrians first worshipped the heauenly was honoured among the Tyrians , and by them deliuered, among the religious Rites of Carthage , to Africa . Now, shee was chiefly honoured by the Mauritanians , and vnder her Image, they cut these Verses in Marble, in which not onely that Goddesse, but Africa it selfe is dignified.  Let not thy Lyons backe, great Goddesse, beare Thee vp to Heauen; dwell in this Temple here: This Temple that with prayers and Gold wee store. If thou but fauour vs, the Lybian shore, That Land, to which the Tyrian Maids gaue name, Rauisht away by a false Bull, in fame Shall not excell: nor Asia , whose soft tracts, Luxuriously enfeeble martiall acts. See, with glad Fates, Africk lifts vp her face, Whom Nerevs does with his crook't armes imbrace All, as a Guardian, but where  Ægypts Land, Does, interpos'd, the meeting Seas withstand. Her Meadowes smile, and their increase full well Her sowne seeds yeeld; couragious Lyons dwell If all her Desarts, her rich Woods abound With whitest Iuory. This golden ground The three Hesperides rich Orchard bred, And Atlas too, sustayn'd by whose strong head, Heauen cannot fall vpon vs; nor a touch Of the base Earth the Starres of Heauen smutch. Here new-borne Pallas did warme Triton first Wash; here Oraculous Ammon doth not thirst, Though seated on the Sands; his horned head Is with a great and shady Wood o're-spred. Vs Mars protects, and Ivno's powerfull hand, Nor will Cyllenivs shun his Grand-fires Land. Be thou, great Goddesse too, Mother of things Present; who ere the wealth of Lybia sings, Whether her Lute, our Muse, or Phoebvs take Thee Goddesse, and thy gifts they first shall speake. Hauing expressed his vowes to the Goddesse, hee spent the rest of the day with his Councell of Warre. There were fifty Ships of seuerall burden, which came with Poliarchvs : in these were carryed aboue twelue thousand armed men: part of the Fleet, weather-beaten with the storme, were put vpon the stockes; the rest were diuided into their Harbours, with the Gallies of Mauritania to Guard the Coasts, and discouer the enemy. They made ready with great preparation, Plankes, Oares, Sayles, Cables, and all sorts of warlike prouision. Betweene the Sea and the City, they pitched their Tents: and the Mauritanians among the French , set vp their Standards in the same place, wearing, according to the custome of the Countrey, the skins of wilde Beasts for Armes, and the hides of Elephants in stead of Bucklers. Yet Poliarchvs was grieued at the small number of them: for they were scarce three thousand mustered Souldiers. But the Citizens which were vnfit for the field, were kept within the City of Lixa , to defend the walls and the rampires. Neither did he question but to be able to master Radirobanes with those forces which hee brought out of France . But if they were to expect a long war, not one set-battel, what should he doe to go into Sicily? Should he passe ouer alone? or transport his souldiers ouer, who were indeed all the strength of that she should increase her owne forces by fresh supplies; not as if he feared Radirobanes ; nor speaking of his owne departure; but as it were to remoue the warre into Sardinia , if perchance the Enemy, growing fearefull, should alter his purpose.  A discourse betweene Poliarchvs and Hyanisbe , touching Tribute and Impositions of Kings vpon their Subiects.  warre, he perswaded that there might be an imposition put vpon all her Subiects, for the discharging of the warre, that the Queene might rayse new Forces, and fresh Companies; and that shee might intertaine the Numidians into pay, who were their Neighbours. It is most sound aduice (replyeth calling of a Parliament, by whose power Subsidies are imposed and rated? Poliarchvs wondered hereat, as being accustomed to free Kingdomes. Is not, quoth he, the Regall power, and the Countries danger, enough to taxe the people, except men chosen by their owne suffrages, shall first giue consent? Is therefore the sinewes of the Kingdome, that is, the Treasury, in the power of the people? Must they be Iudges of all businesses, and Kings ouer their Kings, to rule by this custome all publique affaires, policies, and warlike prouisions? Such truely are not absolute Kings, neyther doth this agree with the title of free gouernement. Then hee began to perswade Hyanisbe , that she should labour to abolish this yoke of maligne custome, by which the Mauritanians had fettered the freedome of their Kings, and now was the most conuenient time to try if the people could be brought to this becke, when being terrified by forreine inuasion, they would trust, by this payment which the Queene should command, to gaine their safety. You shall seeme, saith he, to shew your prerogatiue, not by way of innouation, but in the very instant of danger, to request of your Subiects such a summe for an extraordinary and necessary imployment: That if it shall happily succeed, although it may be some preiudice, as in all other dangers, the same necessitous feare may serue to leuy Subsidies, without questioning the people. And, as things harsh and vnpleasing to vs at first, by custome are reconciled; so, being accustomed, they will, by little and little, suffer the whole matter to depend vpon the will of their Prince; vndoubtedly to the great benefit of the people themselues, whom the shaddow of liberty had oftentimes wronged. I know (replyeth Hyanisbe ) that this would be very aduantagious to my selfe, and my sonne, if I could gaine this prerogatiue to our selues. But this alteration will neuer be brought amongst the people without danger; and now worst of all, when they should be incouraged against their enemies; and forreine broyles threatening sufficiently, without ciuill dissention. I should fight better for Radirobanes , then he could for himselfe with his whole army; for I should incense the affection of the Mauritanians against me,  & reconcile them to him. Besides, the gods forbid that I should indeuour to violate this custome, which I altogether adiudge honest and iust. Which? replyeth Poliarchvs . That, saith Hyanisbe . that Kings should not lay vpon their subiects, without their consent, Taxes and Impositions. Would you haue me lay aside the person of a Queene, and relate what I haue heard, or what I haue thought touching this businesse, that I may either perswade you, or be instructed by you? Be it so, answereth Poliarchvs , support those which cannot fall but by the freedome of their owne power; neither can be preserued, but by their respect to awfull obedience. And withall he addressed himselfe to heare her, scorning in his youthfull minde, that this should be contradicted which hee thought so necessary. Neither did he imagine that shame of her lost power, vnder the colour of equity: as if shee should relieue her owne necessities, if shee could draw other Princes to the same condition to which her selfe was brought. But we know (saith she) how Kingdomes were first ordayned, that humane actions should be ordered by the gouernment of nature and reason, That power being taken away, which draweth all things to the strongest party. But what may you thinke to agree better with nature, then that euery one should enioy his owne goods, which he had gained by the sweat of his browes? or more agreeable to ciuill reason, than that we should know what wee may call our owne, and what another mans? But we take away both these, if at our pleasure we callenge to our Treasury the goods of our Subiects, for which they toyle and labour: and we breed such a distraction in them, that they cannot know how much the Law will giue of their priuate goods to the King, and how much it will leaue to themselues. For how should they know, when it is not at their owne dispose, neither at direction of Law, but at the will of the King onely; and when after one tribute leuied, they shall not yet freely enioy their owne goods, which may be taken away by other Edicts of the King? If you cannot conceiue what are the inconuenience of mixt and confused inheritances, looke vpon the Courts of Law, which swarme with Suites and controuersies, no friends, no brethren can long endure this community, this confusion. Finally, the wiues themselues will know what part of their portions their husbands shall haue, and what they will reserue for themselues. Who may therefore hope for a continuate and publike peace, if what the King taketh from his Subiects, he may make his owne; and what he leaueth them, he may haue yet in common with them? But where there be bounds of taking and bestowing, that Law prescribed by nature, poynted out to euery Family, their bounds, their right, their office: and then the hope of pleasing and gratifying one the other, confirmeth that mutuall league betweene the King and the Subiect: for the Subiect will willingly supply the Kings treasure with his owne wealth, rather than the King should execute extremity of iustice, rashly make warre, conclude peace, or bestow publike offices vpon loose and vndeseruing persons: these shall bee their rewards, by which they shall gratifie the noble disposition of their Prince, and shall also be thankfull for fauours receiued, and deserue others. And the King likewise shal do nothing that may hurt his subiect by strict or strange customes, expecting nothing fro them by harsh or rigorous dealing. These are the most religious bands, which ioyne the King and Subiect together, and protecteth the flourishing gouernment from iniury and insolency. But yet there is need of Treasure, to support the daily expences of the Court; and Strangers iudge of the strength and wealth of a Countrey, by the Royall prouisions of their King. What are their Garisons? What, will you say, their Nauy? There is scarcely any Sea so deepe as to drowne wealth. And we find these things to be true by experience. But I think there are Lawes made by no Subiects so straite for their Kings, as not to allow them sufficient meanes to support the Title and Honour of their Crownes. They haue great reuenues, and with good care-taking, sufficient to ascertaine their Dignity; and also great Imposts, rented by the Customers, at a great rate. They haue also many other priuiledges, which are not the same in all Countries. This Treasure, this wealth may suffice a King for his State, if he will rule alone, and not call vp almost into his Throne, prodigally, those whom hee violently or seruilely affecteth. But when this insatiable desire of bestowing, as of taking, shall possesse them, neither ordinary and lawfull meanes, nor any exaction of Taxes shall glut this deuouring Gulph. The people may fulfill their commands, and bring their wealth and meanes into the common Treasure, yet this Prince (as it is reported of the famine of Erisicthon ) will still be hungry and poore, with an insatiate desire: and he will be so much the more wastefull, by how much the easier he will beleeue, his Treasure being spent, to find a fresh supply. Doe you therefore wonder that the people refraine from this vnprofitable obseruance, and deny to a few principall men about the King, that meanes which was prouided for themselues and their children, which notwithstanding they will freely bestow on the King, when hee earnestly requireth it; not out of the humour of a prodigall disposition, but when the affaires of the Countrey importune it? I heare also in Countries which are most patient of impositions, the Kings doe lesse preuaile by this seruility, than you can beleeue: for this easie gathering of money from the people, doth by little & little ouerthrow the Crowne Lands, and whatsoeuer is the Kings own inheritance: for the ancient Crowne Lands begin to be neglected, as strait and laborious, and like the fortunes of priuate men; afterwards to be deuided amongst Fauourites, to be pawned, and bought and sold, either by true or fraudulent Contracts. So Kings doe lose the most lawfull meanes of liuing from their yeerely reuenue, and appoint another, like to rapine; and not so much increasing as changing their reuenue, they insult like Conquerours. Finally, whether shall you distinguish lawfull Kingdomes from the cruelty of Tyrants, if on both sides the Subiects should enioy their meanes but at other mens pleasure? and the whole wealth sometimes of poore men taken out of their emptied houses, should be offered to sale by the common Crier? Neither doe I procure an ill opinion by the relation of a vaine dreame; if they speake truth who haue trauelled in Countries subiect to Kings in the like sort: for what is exacted from them, man by man, as it is of light account to the wealthy; yet it so ouerchargeth the Countrey people, and the meaner sort of Husbandmen, that it may leaue them neither food, nor a bed whereon to rest their oppressed limbes. What harder measure could they expect from a conquering Enemy? This hard speech concerning the Comminalty, moued Poliarchvs . Hindring therefore Hyanisbe's discourse, he thus began: I could haue wished, great Queen, that such, by whom the report of Impositions came to your eares, had not deliuered with malicious breuity so obscure a thing, but vsed a direct and plaine relation, which should haue absolued as well the King, as the nature of the Tribute and Toll. For Kings haue neuer the thought to shew these examples of cruelty which you speak of. But if the Treasurers or Iudges do sometimes more hardly exact what is in their charge; or if such who leuy the rates by the head, what euery man ought to pay, shall deale vniustly with any, shall we therfore blame Kings and Subsidies? And will you for this cause take away the sinewes of the State, which consist in such Taxes? Be it so: suppose they are in blame which are chosen, in rating of the valuation of euery mans priuate goods; and say farther, that the Officers doe straine their office in distraining goods; and blame, if you please, the King vnder whom these Lawes are so cruell: yet this power of the King shall be nothing the more vnlawfull; I meane this Law of cessing Subiects, of which we now treate, except the thing it selfe be vnlawfull, and the Law and power, because we vse it not lawfully, and they lose their nature, according to the good or bad disposition of those to whom they are committed in charge. What if the Subiect will bestow a subsidy vpon you? You will say, there is nothing more lawfull. But if in the gathering of it, as it doth often happen, there is some hard or vnlawfull proceeding offered to some of them, doth that cease to be lawfull after this vndue proceeding, which was allowed before by the full consent of the Subiects? No body can be counted an absolute King, who hath not full power, without the priuity of his Subiects, to make warre, or conclude a peace. But if they will vse this power vnaduisedly, and quarrell and vrge an enemy without due consideration, how much more hurtfull shall this bee to the people, than any greedy exaction of Impositions? Notwithstanding,  o Queene, you cannot therfore deny this power of raising Souldiers to be most lawfull; because we may vniustly vse that power, as it is already proued: From whence wee may see, that the Lawes themselues are not to be iudged good or bad, according to the honesty or corruption of Officers. You said, that Princes would endeuour by modest carriage and good deeds, that in reward of their vertues, these Subiects might freely bestow these Subsidies on them. You know not what Kings the Subiects doe most honour: how often they dislike faire courses, and loue to be deluded with adulterate vertue, and faire-seeming vice, that at last their affections may swarue from the generall good. So that the vulgar sort must be flattered, and businesse vndertaken according to their desires, that they may reward their Princes for abusing their Regall office. By this reward, they shall remoue authority; and by the same reward, grow riotous and perish. It would go therefore ill with the world, if Kings should desire to please the multitude, and not good men. Most doe thinke those waters to be made the more wholsome, where you draw daily out of the wells, which if they are let stand, they engender diseases: the power and the will of the common people are of the like condition; by the continuance of labour they grow stronger, and hate idlenesse; by rest and ease they waste and consume: Can you therefore deny those incitements to be most necessary, which stirre them vp to a most plentifull diligence in all good courses, and restraine them from sloth and idlenesse? But there are no sharper spurres to this, than these continuall payments to their Prince: because, if for the loue of idlenesse, they had rather liue sparingly, and neglect their attire, than by labour to gaine wealth, they should not therefore be freed; but such as will neglect the care of their owne businesse, should be forced to labour for the King, or rather, for their Countrey, by which they may gaine what is exacted from them against their wills: so that while they are constrained to labour for the profit of others, they will be accustomed also to worke for their owne need. And this custome will inure them better to worke, than their wants, or their duty to the Prince. From hence Trades and handicrafts shall flourish, and their minds and bodies want no employment: and this industrie will not onely make the Countrey rich and plentifull, but strong and manly: by this meanes also, the rude and rusticke people, the Countrey husband-men and plow-men, being tamed by their daily labour, and consideration of their owne estate, will vnderstand, that they are borne to subiect themselues, and not to rule: who, where those Tributes are not ordinary, or vnder the power and authority of their King, to exercise their industry, grow refractory, or foolishly or dangerously insolent, without any regard to the Magistrate. For euer, such who are not exercised to goodnesse, giue the reynes to all licenciousnes; as a Field for want of tillage, which you are afraid to weare out by sowing graine, shall be presently ouerrunne with vnprofitable weedes. But imagine, that there were Lawes which did punish negligence and idlenesse, and that the people, of their owne disposition, were prone enough to labour. And further, suppose that the people wanted not vnderstanding, and vpon the lawfull request of their King, they would disburse their meanes for the good of their Countrey. Yet what if there should happen such occasions, which cannot suddenly be dispatched nor effected, but by the charge of the Comminalty? While the people shall be summoned, and they sit in their election, it will be many weekes trouble, and busines cannot expect so tedious proceedings; and the oportunity is many times ouerslipt by delayes, or the mischiefe vncureable, which might haue beene stopped by present supplies. Why doubt you (great Queene) to acknowledge by this present occasion, how iustly I may complaine of these Customes? your Enemy is vpon your coasts; and warres are maintained no lesse by Treasure than by Sword. But because the Enemy will inuade you sooner than the people can supply you, meanes will be wanting, by which you maintaine your Army, and gather fresh forces out of your neighbour Countrey. But sometimes, not onely sudden occasions happen to Kings, but also priuate, which must not be discouered, and yet can hardly be concealed, while this money is to be raised. Would you inuade an vnprepared Enemie, or gaine from him on a sudden, what he had taken from you; Is it expedient that hee or any of your neighbours should vnderstand your policie? Will you therefore discouer the secret of your intentions, while you demand sufficient means from your Subiects for this businesse, and call a Parliament? then you shall also spend in vaine the very life of your attempts. Yet, if, as you should, you shall keepe this enterprise secret to your selfe, what reason may you alledge to the people, of demanding their ayde? What if they be backward, how shall they be forced? Or doe you thinke your neighbour Countries will not be iealous, and such whom it doth most concerne, will bee sleepy and negligent; whom you might yet haue deceiued by your accustomed authority of raising Subsidies, which had not beene with this noyse and rumour of the people? The very fame of this Parliament which you gather together out of all Prouinces, and which cannot be concealed, doth cause them to suspect, and more narrowly looke to themselues. But if, as it doth often happen, there shall be disagreement between the Subiects and the King, if they shall seeke to displease him by contempt or hatred and shall neglect his courses, though iust and lawfull, what shall then be done? Euen as some vnskilfull Fencers, who while they ayme to strike their enemy, doe knocke themselues with the same blow: so the Subiects, while they intend ill to their odious King, draw the same mischiefe vpon themselues and their Countrey, by denying reliefe, which the affaires of the Common-weale doe necessarily require. Why then doe wee make the Kingly Gouernment, which they themselues acknowledge the best, who dare not make triall, to be weaker than that, which any where a Senate does beare? For truely, in Countries where they are gouerned by a Senate, the people are not called to counsell, or requested, whether they are willing or able to ayde the Common-wealth with their Treasure: the Senators themselues doe determine, ratifie, and command, nor will suffer the people to taste the sweetnesse of authority; which, if we duely weigh, is most requisite in all ciuill gouernments. For why should they haue this power, and yet Kings should bee abridged of it? If (say I) Kings haue power to make Lawes, no lesse than in such a Common-wealth the Senate has, if they haue no lesse power of life and death ouer their Subiects; if they haue the like authority of proclaiming warre, and concluding peace, (which are counted amongst all, of greatest priuiledge) why should they not haue the like power to lay Impositions and Taxes? What be Lawes? What if any Nation hath so ordained it? Whence is the originall of this difference? Or why should Kings allow of the peoples power, which Senators will not doe? Yet greedy or wastfull Princes may wrong the people; so may they in other things, which notwithstanding we doe not take out of their power. Where is that pure and vpright iustice, which no rash violence did euer exercise on innocent persons? But they will empty the Countrey, by gathering vp euery where Treasure. This is a very rare, and (if it hapneth) an exceeding short iniury; when this fault falleth vpon Kings onely, that heape it vp in their Exchequer: and it is a Vice so different from the Genius of a King, that two succeeding in one Race, haue scarcely beene infected with this disease. But such who are immoderate amongst them, both in exacting and liberall giuing, although they hurt many in this excessiue desire, yet this is some ease for the common mischiefe, that as the Ocean receiueth into her bosome the lesser streames and Riuers, and payeth the Earth againe with dewy exhalations and showres of raine: so Princes, by the Nobility whom they fauour, do disperse into the Common-wealth whatsouer they had suckt vp. Although therefore it is much auaileable for the peace of the Weale publike, that Princes should not tempt the affections of their Subiects by excessiue exactions, yet if you shal truely consider, you will find those Countries to haue beene more free from sedition, where the Kings pleasure is sufficient to lay this burden on his Subiects, then such who haue not accustomed themselues to this patience. So that most often the pampred fatnes of the people, and the apprehension of too much liberty, are greater enemies to the peace of the Common-wealth, than the sharpe rigor of Princes who haue shewed greater seuerity. opinion: for Poliarchvs had easily perswaded her, that they were priuiledges due to Princes. In milder language therefore, and lightly refuting what she had heard, by little and little she was of the same opinion; and by the perswasion of Poliarchvs , she presently deuiseth secret meanes to gaine that priuiledge. She commanded the chiefe Officers of her great City of Lixa to be sent for, and making a briefe relation of the danger of the warre, which was nigh at hand, she required them, that they would presently furnish her out of their City Treasure, with an hundred Talents. They instantly obeyed her, being sufficiently drawne to all obedience by the terrour of danger; and their speedinesse heerein was most happy, because within two dayes, the money brought in, mooued other Cities, by their example, to the like care of the Weale publike; and the occasion of their liberality and largesse was doubled, by reason of the Queenes Birth-day, which did luckily then fall out. That day, although in so great a storme, was honoured with no lesse obseruance than in times of peace; yet they went a reuelling in the City and Campe, and dranke crowned; so that before night, Gelanorvs , who had the charge of the Watch for that night, sends word to Poliarchvs , that hee could not rule their disorder: he maketh haste to the Trenches, vnderstanding that in warre, a Captaine must giue no oportunity to Fortune, who loues by sudden accidents to vndoe both the vnprepared, as also deseruing men. But now the most of them were asleepe, being seasoned with their Cups, or else were singing, vnfit to take any instructions: and not the Mauritanians alone, but the common Souldiers of the French . Poliarchvs committed the carefull charge of the Campe, and this drunken Rout, to Gelanorvs , and such as were better settled in their braines. And as he was of a most pleasant disposition, when hee returned into the Citie, hee looked vpon verses, in which one of his owne Druides had thus scoffed at their drunkennesse:  Behold, with frolicke stirre comes Bacchvs here, Behold the god; glad Furies doe him beare, In's Vine-deckt Charriot high; which Tygers strong Draw, arm'd with spoiles of all the East along. Let Trumpets sound, each forehead Iuie weare, And Drums disturbe the quiet night with feare. Hee's come; to powerfull Bacchvs each thing shakes: Houses to reele, and fearefull Poasts he makes. Heere drunken Monsters, vnder th' painted Skie, Danc'd, crown'd with Iuie; and that deity, That gaue Minevs Daughters wings to fly. The Fields, when Bacchvs three yeeres night forth driues, The Tyrian Dir ae , or mad Thracian Wiues Haue not more noise; the god, in drinke inuok's, Foames; and the weakest are to fight prouok't. But heere no blood, no fate does Bacchvs bring, Like Penthevs , or the selfe-maim'd Thracian King: But sleepe-prouoking Poppy and soft paces, Perchance, new boldnes their old feare displaces, Or banisht cares wonder themselues subdu'd, See whole Troupes falne, but in no blood embru'd: They breathe their Conqueror out; fearelesse of ill Fortunes owne Troupe: O Bacchvs , friendly still To wretched men! Oh madnesse full of gaine! But short, and gone, when-e're we wake againe.  Strange accidents happening to Radirobanes .  sleepe had so possest, that they could hardly be wakened with their owne danger, and scarce with wounds: for euen that very night, Radirobanes approaching, sayled vp the same Riuer with his whole Fleet, and setting on the Watch, suddenly seized the Sea-Shore. The Souldiers leauing their Ships, fly to the Campe, or, being distracted with feare, to the Gates of the City, which were as well shut against them as their enemies: the Galleys made away to Sea, where silence told them the enemy was not. Radirobanes presently landing most of his Souldiers, and imagining the City not able to withstand the suddaine terrour of his comming, hee deuided his Campe into seuerall quarters, some to man the shore, and others to assault the Towne, and scale the walls. But the like dread and fortune did not possesse the Africans and French which were in the Campe, as the Mariners and Sea-forces. Gelanorvs hearing the vprore vpon the Sea-shore, caused the Souldiers to be wakened, and Alarme sounded: sleepe had made some of them fresh, and danger others. He hauing put his Souldiers in array in their Trenches, leauing them to the command of French the Enemy, being now secure of a certaine victory. After owne defence, and finding that the inconuenience of time and place, at an vnseasonable time of night, would proue dangerous to forrainers and strangers, caused a Retreat; thinking that he had day enough, beeing master at Sea, to haue landed his men at his first arriuall; and hee promised to himselfe an easie victory the next day, beeing ignorant that hee was to deale with to haue beaten backe the Enemy from the City and their Tents, did not labour to breake in vpon their quarters, and refrained from attempting any thing that night, especially without the presence and priuity of the King. The next morning, Poliarchvs , who was ashamed for the last nights ouersight, called a Councell of French & Mauritanians : there complaining, that there was a military offence comitted by those which guarded the Sea, he causeth all the French which had left the Nauy, to be broght before him vnarm'd, and euery tenth man, by casting lots, to suffer for his fault. And the like was the Queenes doome against her Mauritanians . But when they were brought to execution, she intreated for the French , and he for the Africans . So by a lighter way of punishment, which was vsuall amongst offending Souldiers, (for it was conuenient that they should bee punished) some are let blood in the arme; others are commanded to worke in the Trenches, halfe naked; and the rest in the like fashion to stand in the Market place, to make themselues an example to the rest. And although they wanted Souldiers at that time, yet they are left that day, to be made a common spectacle, that the feare of punishment might deterre others. And now Poliarchvs himselfe, mounted on a Numidian Courser, clad in a Scarlet Coate, riding bare-fac'd vp and downe the Campe, filled the Companies with an awfull respect, and an assurance of conquest. Then leauing sufficient guard for the Court, City, and Gates, he setteth forward with the rest to the Campe: the souldiers marching along in Ranke and File vnder the command of battell. Radirobanes also set his men in array, being more troubled in mind and countenance, euer since he heard by one of the Captiues, that there was amongst them a French King, who was called Poliarchvs : (for hee would be called by that name, vnder which he had gained so much honour amongst strangers in a meaner fashion.) Radirobanes presently remembreth, that the Young-man was so called for whose loue Argenis refused his Alliance; but whether this were the man, he was much in doubt, because many might be called by the same name; neither had Selenissa euer named him as King: and especially, If he were a King, what should he doe in Africa ? What god had brought these two Corriuals to try it in combate? Or what angry quarrelling disposition, that he should first crosse his hopes in Sicily , by stealing away the affection of Argenis , and now, as it were of purpose, should come into Mauritania , to hinder his designes heere? But the approaching battell turned this confused course of his thoughts into choler. There was an indifferent Plaine betweene the place where place, appointed for the battell, shined thorow the whole Field with bright Harnesse and displayed Ensignes: Each King had the leading of the right wing of his Army: Vertiganes commanded the left wing of the Sardinians: and left wing to old Mecipsa , who was of great repute among them; yet youth, which age had weakned in Mecipsa . It was obserued as a great hope of victory, that very few of the French and Mauritanians made their wills when the Army was ready to giue battell; they were so confident, not onely to conquer, but to share the spoyles. Vpon the Allarme giuen, the Archers gaue the first charge; but the Armies rushing together more violently than their Leaders were willing, the whole body ioyned: so that the Archers and Slingers are made vnnecessary, scarcely a place left for the Pike-men, and the Horse could hardly turne in their Troupes. So all being violent at the first shocke, yet none equalled the power and courage of Poliarchvs ; although gained the great applause of their Captaines, either by their owne wounds, or the death of their enemies: many innocent people suffered for the fury of a few; and which is the most pittifull mischiefe of warres, they did not fight and kill men for hatred and wrong done, but onely as fortune deuided them. And now there was much blood spilt, when it pleased the gods to preuent the imminent danger of many beeing vpon the Swords point: for such an obscure Cloud darkned the day, that many trembled, as at the sight of a prodigious and vnseasonable night; then the cracking of thunder, and the fearefull flashing of lightning, turnes their fury, raging in one anothers bloud, into prayers and astonishment. But while they were thus distracted  & doubtfull to fight or pray, some Elephants, being inraged, brake their rankes, which Hyanisbe had commanded to be brought into the battell, with their Tower-like carriages. Many of them being lately taken in hunting, and as yet almost wilde, had not forgotten their liberty and fierce nature. But as yet this sight was vnknowne to Europe , a huge and ill-fashioned Creature, hauing all his limbes as it were digested in one bulke: hauing his head buried in semblance betweene his shoulders, round like a Globe, excepting where his long Trunke reacheth downe to the ground, hanging deformedly from his Nose, and differing onely in colour from a long and ouer-growne. Serpent, so knit by thicke sinewes from ioynt to ioynt, that it might be drawne vp loosened, turned euery way, and serue him in stead of a hand. His broad eares couer both sides of his head, his eyes hidden in a little round compasse, vnder a swelling brow: his Iuory tooth, for which they are most precious, stretcheth it selfe out almost like a Horne, but that it bendeth in the weaker part. At this vgly shape, not onely the Sardinians , against whom these were brought, were astonished, but the French themselues seemed to be afraid at their owne succours. But after the skies began to be darkened with these suddaine Clowds, the Elephants, as apt to feare as to be angry, and affrighted with the vnusuall noyse from the Clowds, began to be more vnruly to their Gouernours; when the strange Lightning flashing against their eyes, did so trouble the strongest of them, that presently he began to fall mad, and forgetting all rule, ranne vp and downe whither his fury did leade him: the rest doe breake forth with violence, and, throwing their Riders, follow the first. Growing afterwards more mad, and casting off all gouernement, they seemed to be enemies not to one party onely, but to the whole Field, and ranne thorow their rankes and troupes with outragious fury: and because they could not see the end thorow the Rankes and Files, they seeke their liberty, as if they were ashamed of their slauery. Many of the French did breake their rankes; neyther was the fortune of the Sardinians better: some were met and ouerthrowne by these furious Monsters, many were taken vp in their bending Trunkes, and cast violently into the ayre. Their huge greatnesse, the nouelty, and fearefull experience of their strength, did much dis-hearten the troubled Souldiers: They durst not coniecture that the vengeance of the gods was come, or that these Monsters were new inuentions to breake the rankes of the battell. The very sight of these dreadfull Beasts, did force some to present flight, the feare of their companions did likewise amaze such as were farther remoued; their Horses were growne head-strong, not able to indure their sent, and scorning their Riders, carryed them ouer Hils and Dales,  & amongst their Enemies. It was a strange iest of Fortune, that so great an Army should be rowted by thirteene sauage Beasts (for there were no more.) By which it is euident, that ability of body is not more auayleable in battels then courage of minde; and that a multitude is conquered as soone by feare, as by the Sword. would slenderly make head, if they should be charged anew; and the Sardinians feared the like. By the diligent search therefore of the Captaines and Leaders, such were separated one from another, whom the same feare had mingled out of seuerall troups: for eyther the flight of them or their horses had driuen some so farre amongst their aduerse Companies, that they were in danger in their Retreat, to haue their throats cut by their enemies. But, as the remembrance of vulgar mens Fates does dye; so the fortune of King Radirobanes was memorable. He did ride on a Horse, in all respects most fit for seruice, but that he was somewhat vnruly in a feare: for as his feares were seldome, so they were great, and full of madnesse. But then, when the Elephants had broke the rankes, ouercome with feare, the Horses thorow the whole Campe frighted with the like distemper, his Horse ranne away as if hee had beene mad, and the King vnable to gouerne him, being stiffe-necked, and stronger then the Bit with which he was held in, hee carryed him forceably into the Enemies Campe. In the meane time, the troupes of Horse, by Poliarchvs his command, retyred towards the Towne, with an intent to goe directly thither; such of away from him, and beleeued in this feare, that he had beene with them. Being therefore alone, and farre distant from his owne Companies, he altred the fiercenesse of his courage, into excessiue astonishment: Whether he should labour in vaine to escape, being incompassed by so many enemies? or rather saue his life by yeelding? or aduenture his life in a dangerous and vnequall fight, seeing there was little hope of ransome if he should be taken prisoner? He looking backe to his owne Colours, which were farre remoued from him: What, should he retyre by little and little? Then his Enemies would enuiron him round about. While he standeth in doubt; while in his furious rage he curseth his hard fortune; the danger in the meane time increased, and the troupe wherein he was enuyroned, had marched to the very Gates of the City; and the onely meanes left for his safety, was to counterfeit himselfe one of Poliarchvs his Souldiers. And this was a great helpe to his guile: In the beginning of the skirmish, that hee might the freer execute the office of a Commander and a Souldier, he left off his Princely Robes, his purple Cassocke, his gilded Helmet, and the other markes of honour which hee had deliuered to secure concealement, with three hundred of Poliarchvs his horsemen. But whither should he then goe? All the Souldiers had their seuerall lodgings and intertainement. Now, if hee should put himselfe vnder any priuate Company, he could not conceale himselfe amongst a few, though armed hee had deluded many: yet if he shunned all mens society, what were it, but to betray himselfe by suspicious solitarinesse? So long therefore as these few troupes did stand about the Market-place, (for they were there gathered together, to receiue their charge from their Captaines) he was easily secure by helpe of the multitude. But not long after, there came a Messenger from Poliarchvs , which commanded that those troupes of Horse which had entred the Towne, should goe to their lodgings, and be a Guard for the Queene that night. At the report hereof, Radirobanes was almost dead for feare: for the Horse were quartered in diuers places, and euery man billited in his seuerall house. The Strangers and Slaues discharged their dueties. Hee himselfe, as if to looke his Lodging, went alone about the streets, not knowing whom he should chiefly shun, but still all that he met were dreadfull to him: hated of all, and being apprehended, perhaps he should be preserued onely for his ransome; hee could hardly suppresse his feare, and rage increasing more and more; sometimes taking courage, he thought openly to professe himselfe an enemy, and eyther dye valiantly, or redeeming his liberty by his bold attempt, hee would make his way thorow the Watch at the Gate; because there was onely one in that time of trouble, which was left open for carriages and horse, which was also guarded by a strong Watch. No body came neere the head of his horse in the way, or lookt vpon him passing by, whom he did not auoyd with a fresh shiuering, as if he had beene intentiue vpon him. When he had spent a long time in this punishment of feare, wandring about the Towne; and that he must no longer stand doubting, hee met with some horse- keepers, with their Masters horses, which they were leading to water. guiding, he might come to the Riuer. But this was the situation of the City: about a furlong from the Rampiers, there ranne a Riuer toward that part of the City which leades to the Sea; where the enemies had pitched their Tents: on that side of the Towne which was farthest from the Sardinians , a great Lake washed the very walls of the Towne, at least sixe furlongs broad, and twelue in length; neyther was there any other place, where they could wash or water their horses. This way they feared no danger from their Enemy, being not passable to the City, but by shipping: They had therefore fortified by a guard of Souldiers, a little Gate, which did lye open to a Creeke of the Lake, and they opened it twice euery day, to water their Cattel, and for seuerall occasions of the Citizens. The Groomes did then goe to that Gate, in whose company Radirobanes mingled, and perceiuing the bredth of the Lake extended out in that length, being almost hopelesse to escape by swimming, yet, as it were, for his last refuge, he gathered courage, and thus (according to his owne relation to his Souldiers) made his prayers to the great god Neptvne : O most powerfull of all the gods, who doe enioy the same elements with mortall men, of whose gift Riuers, Fountaines, and Lakes are; O good god, make calme these waters, which, for my safeties sake, I now intend to swim ouer; let them beare mee, and set mee safe vpon the opposite shore: Giue power also to this Horse (for thou hast rule ouer these Creatures, and by striking the ground didd'st make a Horse) to this Horse, I say, which serues to mee (poore Abiect) for a Boat and Oares, that whom hee deliuered to the Enemy by his too much mettle, by the same strength hee may preserue from them. Then will I erect, out of the spoyles of Africa , in the shore by Calaris , where my Ancestors haue dedicated a Chappell, and a Groue to thee, a memoriall liuely set out in Brasse, of thy fauour, and my danger. Offering these Vowes in priuate to the god, hee first rode softly into the water, which grew deeper and deeper, and then, hauing watred his Horse, he spurred him forwards, they crying out to him in vayne, who were with him in the Lake, that neere at hand it was very deepe: but hee, viewing to which part of the shore the course of the water would soonest beare him, puts both his Spurres to his Horse, who fiercely tossing his Mane, did swimme presently into the water, and holding vp his head, carryed his Master vpon his backe, which way he was commanded. They cry out to him from the shore: and the Mauritanians , when hee first began to swimme, thinking it by chance or negligence, shew him which way hee might soonest guide his horse backe: but by little and little he did swimme forward into the depth, euery one that beheld him censuring diuersly, as in a strange and sudden accident; and vndoubtedly thinking that he would be drowned. And now they thought him to be dead, and to be carryed like a Carkasse vpon the waues; for after he was gone a great way from the shore, they could discerne by the colour only, that a thing did swimme aboue water.  how bee saued himselfe. The disorder of his Army in his absence; and his returne. Cruell and superstitious Sacrifices of the Affricanes .  strength of his Horse increased his hope, whom by his voyce, and stirring of the reynes, he would oft incourage to his best indeuours. The waters flowing neyther way, made their voyage more easie: for they were still waters, and then more then vsually calme, as being no winde stirring: yet the Horse now began more hardly to indure water, and seemed to faint; when in the middest of the flouds, high Sands, which somewhat stopped them, did opportunely ease the necessity of their swimming. Hee stood therefore weary with blowing out water, and being but brest-high, as if hee wondred at his labour, he eased himselfe by taking breath. But the King, fearing lest his Horse should waxe stiffe after rest, being ouer-toyled with much motion, gaue him but short time to breathe, and spurred him into the Lake, while his ioynts were yet supple. The stirring of his body was sufficient to teach the lusty Horse: and the waues, and his strayning to swimme, deferring his death, he liued till he came to the farthest shore. Then fainting, scarcely staying till the King could alight without a fall, hee stretched himselfe, out vpon the Sand. But Radirobanes trembling at the greatnesse of fore-past danger, that hee had entred into the Enemies City, and made an escape from thence, thorow a vast Lake, and dangers almost more terrible then death it selfe, was now perplexed with a fresh feare, and suspected lest he should be pursued by Water and Land, and eyther suffer captiuity or death: for his Campe was farre distant from the banke-side of the Lake. But this was his comfort, that night was now at hand, which alwayes is the best safegard to danger and flight. In the meane time, Poliarchvs placing his Courts of Guard, and speaking briefly to Hyanisbe , would not stay in the Court, but commanded that his Pauilion should be set vp in the Campe, hauing a watchfull eye to all instants of Fortune, if hee could finde any aduantage ouer his Enemy. Neyther had hee left them that night, except the tumult amongst the Sardinians seeking their King, had drawne him backe to be more regardfull and cantelous; because it was doubtfull what occasion should make such a noyse in the Enemies Campe, and so many Torches lighted about the Fields: for the Sardinian Captaines assembling at the Kings Pauilion, asked one the other, whether the King were returned, if hee had not turned out of the way to some other part of the Campe; finally, who was with him in the skirmish, who had protected him retyring out of the Battell. After euery one had giuen his seuerall opinion, all of them with one consent suspected more sad and dyre euents. They feared that hee was eyther slayne or taken Prisoner. They were also ready to fall foule one with the other, who should haue beene with the King, who should haue guarded him, at least, who should haue beene able to haue brought certaine newes of him: but especially the common sort of Souldiers, whether through griefe and affection to their lost Prince, or else growne outragious, neglecting the command of their Captaines, whose authority had dependance vpon the King, left all orderly discipline; some searched the wandring Fields, if by chance hee had strayed that way, to finde him; calling him by his name. Many by lighting Torches, returned in search, where the bloudy fight was, viewing the faces of the dead bodies, and there fearing to finde what they sought for. So the Fields were euery-where filled with the voyce of the Sardinians, with their lights, and excursions. nightly religion of Bacchvs , or the fury of some other god, or some deuice prepared against him, hee carefully sets his Watch and Ward against all occasions. But while they are busie in this search and confused inquiry, newes are presently brought, that Radirobanes was returned to his Pauilion: for hee being landed at the banke-side of the Lake, before the darke night did ouer- take him, diligently considered by what way hee might get to his owne Campe; at length, hee resolued to follow the Marish-shore, that if any should eagerly pursue him, hee might suddenly hide himselfe amongst the Reedes. So he went about the Lake, and then out of the rodeway ouer ditches and hedged fields, hee came to his owne Campe. This was very dreadfull to him, in that the Souldiers being dispersed with Torches, had filled the skie with out-cryes. And he not knowing that this search was for himselfe, carefully auoyded their sight and presence. At length, hee commeth to his owne Tent; and the Souldiers being commanded to desist from their vnlucky, and now superfluous inquiry after him, being ouer-ioyed, with the like vnrulinesse they flocke all to the Kings Tent. After they had seene him, and expressed their great ioy, they were hardly gotten backe to their owne Wards and Lodgings. In the meane season, Vertiganes , and the chiefe of the Sardinians , falling downe at Radirobanes his feet, asked him with teares, what fortune, or what policy kept him so long from his owne Souldiers. Hee relateth his danger at large, with the great admiration of all, euery one ambitiously expressing his feare. And while all doe striuingly eyther giue the gods thankes, or flatter their King as Conquerour ouer Fate and Fortune, a certaine Poet, friend to Vertiganes , instantly maketh Lines vpon the same Subiect, and calleth Radirobanes a Sunne to his Sardinians , who did wither in his absence, and receiue life from his breath and cheerefull countenance.  Durst then the Clowdes obscure our day, and dye Our Pole in darkenesse? Wee through-out the skie Haue sought for our pale Sunne's eclipsed light: But hee (O Fates!) was gone; by th' Queene of night He was ecclips'd, or by some path vnknowne In Heauen, to Cyrrha's shades descended downe. What horrid cares our brests then seiz'd at once? We lost our selues; oh yeeld, yee Nations, Among Arcadia's fruitfull Forrests bred, While wee our flying Titan followed With feare; our meanes reacht to the Westerne shore, As people doom'd to darkenesse euermore. Returne, braue Prince of Men; our Lawes are fled, And nights blacke deeds shall scape vnpunished. What is mankinde without thee: to what Fate Does thy departure doome vs? th' Ayres darke state Shall in thicke Clowdes the formelesse World inuolue, And Natures selfe into cold Ice dissolue. O Mortals, spare your griefe; lose not your teares; See's purple rayes, see his bright head appeares; Behold his scepter'd Armes, his radiant light, His fiery Arrowes in a Quiuer bright. Hayle the gods care; doe not from vs remoue. The Woods let this night-guiding Sister loue. Thou Men and Cities loue, care thou alone To send all Lands the day from thy bright Throne. The next day, hauing already tryed each others strength, their will and edge to fight was abated, excepting Poliarchvs , whose minde was onely vpon the battell; for hee desired to fight, both through spleene to Radirobanes , and desire to goe for Sicily : But hee yeelded to the Queenes intreaties, not to prouoke the peaceable enemy that day. It was a strange matter that battell, and that King Radirobane's rashnesse should be turned into such care: for both their minds did appeare by the strangenesse of the Sacrifices, to which they sought for helpe: for the Queen commanded a beautiful Boy to be chosen out, which should be sacrificed to Satvrne : The custome of the Sacrifice had his originall from the Tyrianes , who had conueyed by tradition, this cruell custome in Africa , to the Carthaginians , a Colony that came from them. Hyanisbe being afraid, vsed this strange and barbarous deuotion towards the gods: for miserable and carefull mortals doe imagine fearefull and vnknowne remedies to haue some hidden power. The manner of this sad Sacrifice was made ready, and the Host receyued his Ornaments; neyther wanted there a Priest for this damned Religion. But when this was reported to Poliarchvs , being much moued, hee presently started vp, and posting to Hyanisbe, , saith; If this remedy of abominable cruelty (great Queene) be auayleable against your Enemies, you shall suffer mee to depart: for I will neuer mingle my Forces with that vile superstition, neyther will I suffer that my Souldiers shall seeme to be strengthned with that god, whosoeuer he be, that loueth so cruelly to be pleased. I will not, I say, wrest from the gods a victory, at so shamefull a rate, who are not of those whom we should truely worship, or else they disdaine this scandall of men, so much blinded in their false Religion: Eyther therefore free this Boy from prison, or send mee out of your Countrey. Although Hyanisbe feared the great god Satvrne , yet Poliarchvs was neerer at hand with her: the Ribbands are taken from the Boyes head; and this very action eased the mindes of the people, because Poliarchvs did not seeke the vttermost remedies: for could so great a Captaine be ignorant of the successe of warre, or vnlesse he knew the victory to be easie, would he not vouchsafe to purchase it of the gods, with the bloud of one little Childe?  A furious resolution of a Sardinian , who offered his owne life, for the successe of Radirobanes . A contumelious Letter of the King of Sardinia .  a certaine old man, famous amongst the Sardinians , (who was Sitalces ) heretofore of great valour, now a iudicious Counsellor, came to offereth himselfe a Sacrifice, with which they might promise to themselues conquest from the Infernall gods. Neyther is it materiall, saith he, that I am a priuate man. It shall be sufficient, if you that are my King shall offer me a Sacrifice, that I may sustaine and procure the publique safety. After I shall be adorned as a Sacrifice to the gods, by due forme, I will with a small troupe prouoke the Enemy to battell to day, in which carrying terror and reuenge with me against them, I shall be slaine by some, not knowing that my death shall be their ruine. Radirobanes stopping somwhat at the ioy, as he hoped, of the offered victory, and knowing the vertue of giuing, themselues to death, to be counted powerfull by the Italian Prophets, prodigally praysed & cannot know the rewards you deserue, yet you shall know I wil euer be a most constant fauourer of your Race; that none of the Sardinians shall desire more to liue, then to aduance their Families to that glory and renowne which they shall see in thine. Go on with a courage, and gaine that eternall glory by a short course of dying, which no death can extinguish. He called therefore the chiefe Priest which should consecrate him for his vow to the Etrarian manner. And Sitalces being presently clad with a long Purple Robe, his head couered, stood ouer a Sword, and putting his hand vnder his Chin, he followed all the words after the high Priest, by which he bequeathes to the gods infernall, and the earth together, with himselfe, the French , and Mauritanian Legions. Finishing the ceremony; It is time (saith hee) as yet the deuotion fresh, that I carry terror, flight, and death vpon my enemies; giue me some light-armed men, who, vnder colour of skirmishing, should goe with mee to the very Rampiers of the Enemy. Wee will prouoke them to the battell, or at least those who shall guard their Trenches: and our men of purpose flying, I will obstinately force my death from the Enemies hands, and by my death, shall they bee offered vp to your Sword, and you shall be able to take your fill of vengeance vpon them so accursed. This speech of Sitalces seemed as strange as wonderfull, to most of the Sardinians . Presently some bands of Archers were appoynted for him, by whom he might draw forth the Enemy to skirmish: But Sitalces had a Seruant, whom he had freely of a long time entertayned, who was more affectionate to his Master, then his Countrey. He, thinking his Master to be mad, in desiring so suddaine a death, after he could not disswade him, by stealth flyes to Traytor to my owne Countrey, to auert their safety, and your eminent ruine. Neyther doe I desire any greater reward, then that you should saue his life, whose death is ordayned for your vtter ouerthrow. Then briefly he discouered the mad intent of Sitalces : which after Poliarchvs had heard, he did not so much wonder at the diuellish power of his blinde deuotion (for he beleeued not that his whole Army could be vanquished by the voluntary death of one desperate and haire-brain'd man) then hee did desire to preuent the feare of his Souldiers, which might steale into their superstitious conceits. He therefore commanded the discouerer to attend for his reward, if he brought true newes: and he puts him among his Bow-men, who had the Front of the Battell, giuing him a French Armour, yet putting a Guard vpon him, that if, as hee related, some light troupes of the Sardinians should assayle them, they might repell them in the first on-set. But they had a strict charge, that they should rather affright, and threaten, then hurt them, lest by chance they should light on Sitalces , whom hee would haue preserued without danger. But the Seruant had his owne, and his Masters freedome granted, if he could descry him in any conuenient time in the fight. Sardinians , leading forth Sitalces : presently the Archers appoynted by Sardinians making little stay with their Darts, vnder the colour of flight, left Sitalces , being desirous to dye; and, by the hope of death, during beyond the strength of man. But the Seruant cryed out aloud, that hee was the man, whom Poliarchvs commanded to saue aliue. They receyued him therefore, raging, into the middest of their troupes, and being defended by their Armes, suffered his blowes, and disarmed him, being incompassed by them, bringing him to their Tents, refusing to yeeld, and prouoking their fury by opprobrious and reuiling speeches: whom when Poliarchvs perceiued, he thus spake to him; You shall sup better with vs this night, then with the infernall gods: neither doe reuile vs as cruell, who compell you to liue: for when the Fates haue decided the euent of this warre, we will be no hindrance to you, if then you will seeke any death. But I would not haue you boast among the ghosts, that the gods had bestowed prodigally all our liues, as a foolish reward of your seruice. Then he calleth to him one of the prisoners, and setteth him at liberty, vpon this condition, that he shall goe tell King Radirobanes , that griefe for the losse of his friend; and that at least he should liue till the end of the warre; for the Mother Earth and the infernall gods refused him, as a reward for victory which they could not giue. This newes being related by the Captiue, the misfortune of the attempt, and also the reproachfull words of neither did he yet certainly know, whether he was that Poliarchvs whom iealousie, he determined to search out the truth by a doubtfull Letter; which loue betweene them: but if he were the same whom Selenissa betrayed, hee would presently vnderstand the meaning, and shew direct signes of anger and enuy. And presently hee sendeth Letters to Poliarchvs , by a French-man which he had taken prisoner; which he (being ignorant of the abusiue language contained therein) carried to his Lord the King: for Radirobanes had spared neither Argenis nor Hyanisbe : and he farther affirmed that he did much wonder that Theocrine , after the acquaintance of a pretty young Princesse, should dote on Hyanisbe : as he had deceiued the young Lady, so by the iust punishment of Loue, was hee deluded by an old Woman. But he would reuenge himselfe for Sicily , to whom he had solemnly vowed to cut off the head of the counterfeit Pallas. Poliarchvs full of indignation, and now making warre against Radirobanes , no lesse for his owne sake, than for distempered countenance, that one might reade some important businesse in his face. Besides the basenesse of reuiling language, his thoughts were yet much troubled at the names of Theocrine and Pallas , and much muses with himselfe, who should disclose this secret to Radirobanes : vntill hee called to mind, that in the last conference he had with Argenis , shee much complained to him of the false dealing of Seelnissa : then he, coniecturing the head of the spring to flow from thence, grinding his teeth, began to thinke vpon reuenge against both of them, making Radirobanes and  The Battell betweene both Armies. What Art the Sardinians vsed. The Combate betweene Poliarchvs and Radirobanes . The Africans prooue victorious.  blowes, and not words, he sets his Army in Battell array, giuing Hyanisbe warning before-hand, that shee should let none come into the Gates of the City at the time of the Battell, and that he made no question of the Victory: but if any of his Souldiers should fly out of the Field, he would not haue her receiue them within the Walls. He neuer seemed more cheerefull to the Souldiers: with an affable speech addressing himselfe to euery one of them, he shewed the French , what honour awaited them for ayding of Queene told them, how they were both wealthy, and that Sardinia was fast by; which, saith hee, we shall haue at our mercy, as Radirobanes did thinke to haue Africa , if we shall now be Conquerors. These words indeed put courage in them all, but more the cheerefull countenance of the speaker. Neither was rewards in this victory. For he therefore beleeued that Poliarchvs was presently reuenge the message sent the day before: if he could therefore kill him, he did thinke by his very death, that he should both be reuenged to the full of Argenis , and depose Hyanisbe from her Kingdome. Vpon which Conquest, being strengthened with the Kingdome of Mauritania , he would passe ouer into Sicily , not hauing any enemy left, who durst looke the Conquerour in the face, or withstand his power heereafter. Proud with the great hope heereof, he aduanceth his Troupes set in array toward Poliarchvs now comming. There was no body who did not imagin that this day would decide the difference betweene these two Armies. The more therefore their care was; the Citizens mingled their hope with greater feare; the old men could not be kept backe from the walls of the City; nor the howling women, with their children in their Armes, whom, poore innocents, they shewed to the gods, praying them that the enemy might not haue power ouer their tender bodies. The Ilanders of Majorque and Minorque , who were in Radirobanes his Campe, troubled the Numidians , who were set to begin the Battell with their Darts. But Poliarchvs commanded his French Horse to set forward, and gaine their ground from them, that they might be made vnnecessary; and hee warned the Numidians , that leauing the Front, they should wheele about, charging the Enemy in the flankes, and turne them that way to leaue their order. On the other side Radirobanes , shewed himselfe to bee an expert Leader, comanding some Troupes of Horse to enuiron the wing of the enemies Battel, and to assault them on the sudden in the Reare; and withall he sent some that could speake the French and Numidian Language, who should cry out, as it were by Poliarchvs his command, That the Sardinians had got the victory, and the French and Mauritanians should fly,  & that Lixa was open to receiue them. This noyse daunted many of them at the first; but afterward it turned into a iest, and the like outcry passed thorow the contrary Army, that the Sardinians should fly. There was now no space betweene the two Armies, body against body, and sword to sword; so that nothing was left in this strait, but to conquer or dye. The voyce of some that encouraged the faint-hearted, and the grories of the wounded, mingled with the clattering of Armour, sent a dolefull noyse into the City. The French were stronger in Horse, yet the Sardinians and Ligurians were not inferiour in Foot. But the Generals bestirred themselues most: on the one side, Poliarchvs , furious against his naturall inclination, stopt his eares to the cryes and grones of people begging life; whether the heate of the fight, or his spleene against Radirobanes made him deafe to their lamentations: who, on the other side, entred sometimes alone, breaking their Ranks, as if he had forgotten his fault, when he was carried into Lixa against his will, amongst his enemies. So the Sardinians did shrinke vnder Poliarchvs , and the French and Numidans vnder satisfied or appeased by vulgar blood: it was onely Radirobanes his heart blood, which was guilty of reproachfull slanders against Argenis and Enemy, who might answer his worth  & anger, through his own and his aduerse Troupes; & often crying alowd, That, if he durst, if he were a man, hee should accept the challenge, to try the fortune of the Battell hand to hand. This voyce often doubled, and passing from one to another, mastred the fearefull and confused tumult of the Combatants and dying people; and at length came to this alone made ashamed, that he had not first challenged. He quickly left all other conflicts, and without delay hastened against his Enemie. Africa it selfe had not seene Lions and Serpents moued with so great fury: yet they stopped their willing hands for a short parley: and first Poliarchvs said; Art thou come, wretched Theefe? receiue now punishment for all thy mischiefe: thou shalt not now escape my hands, not though thy mother had made thy body lesse penetrable then Achilles was. I offer to thee, deare Mistris, this Sacrifice, if you will accept of so vile an oblation. Radirobanes replyes, Art thou at length come out of thy Nurcery, most effeminate Louer? But a Souldiers death shall make amends for thy effeminate life. Doubt not therefore like a man to offer thy selfe to my fury. Neither of them had patience to answer these reproachfull taunts; and fury, which was wont to breathe courage, growing excessiue and transcendent, had almost weakned their strength; yet they encountred with their Horses and Launces, with no lesse fury, then if a whirle-wind had dashed two Rockes one against the other, but their blowes for that time fell without harme; and their Horses, although they were bruised at that shocke, yet were not vnusefull for the residue of the Combat. Reyning therefore their Horses about, each of them spent their Darts freely one on the other, which were likewise taken on their Targets. Each of them had yet one Dart left, and, that that might not bee bestowed in vaine, they diligently watched their best opportunity by their eyes  & hands. At length, Radirobanes thought it the safest course to strike thorow his enemies Horse; which that it might not goe vnreuenged, Poliarchvs likewise woundeth his in the head. Then both of them fearing the fall of their Horses, or their vnruly madnesse in the instant of death, as it were by consent, they both alight, and snatching their Pole- axes which hung by their saddlebowes, they fell afresh to the Combate. But they were parted by the piety of their Souldiers: the two Armies of the French & Sardinians came betwixt their fury: when both of them did much dislike those succours: at length, with much adoe, not without often commands from their Princes, they departed, and left the Field to the two combating Kings, who beeing yet without hurt, leauing their Pole-axes, they held their Bucklers in the left hand, and their Speares in the right. Radirobanes first came on, whose blow Poliarchvs auoyding, with a more steady thrust, wounded Radirobanes deeply in the side. Then they drew their swords, clozing often so together, that they might strike one the other in the face or brest with the hilts of their Swords. No part of their body, no riuets in their Harnesse were left vntryed. Feare seized all, and then pitty, to see two Kings of so great courage to indanger themselues, their Souldiers beeing in safety. Then their Armies ioyned againe, and deuided the Princely Combatants; which both of them taking for a disgrace, asked the next that came, with anger and authority, if they thought him to bee vanquished, that they made such haste to protect or draw him from the Combate? So shaking off the Souldiers and Captaines, they both returne to the last tryall, with inuincible courage indeed; but the losse of much blood had infeebled their power; and being breathlesse, their blowes were weake and vnsteady; yet Poliarchvs had more courage and blood left in him; and then calling to mind the occasion which had bred the enmity, and being assured that full thrust, and ranne Radirobanes thorow the necke, betweene the ioynts of his Helmet and Corslet. He knowing himselfe slaine, and making haste to reuenge, runnes headlong vpon Poliarchvs , and beares him vnawares to the ground with the weight of his body, so that both fell in the place. The whole Field presently was filled with lamentation, sometimes thinking one and then another to be slaine; most indeed beleeuing that they had beene both dead. And because Poliarchvs fell vnder Radirobanes waight, the feare of the French and Mauritanians coniectured the worst: and there wanted not some, who would haue runne hastily to Hyanisbe , to tell this dolefull newes of the King. The thickest Troupes of the French and Sardinians came in great number: no regard to their Commanders, their Ensignes and Rankes could preuaile nothing with them: euery one thought it his duty to runne to their King, and remoue them out of the Field, whether they liued or dyed: so that these turbulent helps had almost ouerwhelmed Poliarchvs But now by little and little he had freed himselfe from the grappling of his Enemie, and strooke at him, now giuing vp the ghost. But when the French and Mauritanians perceiued him rise, and that he was liuing, proud with excessiue gladnesse, they set vpon the Sardinians , who were ready to protect the dead body of their King Radirobanes , and to annoy Poliarchvs with their Darts. But the danger was short; for both the ioy of the Conquest had refreshed Sardinians therefore fell off by degrees, attributing somewhat to themselues, that in so great a calamity they abstayned from flight. Being therfore disperst abroad, Poliarchvs was truely a Conquerour, hauing gained the dead body of his Enemie, and the rich spoyles. The end of the Fourth Booke.

Thus adorned, he ascended his Chariot, drawne by white horses; and in this most glorious shew, enuironed with his Souldiers, and carrying his rich spoyles, went forward to the Temple of Mars : for there was no religion then obserued in Africa to the Feretrian Ivpiter . The people, as well as they could for the hastinesse of the pompe, each in their trimme, filled vp the wayes, some bearing the greene boughes in their hands, which they met with by chance in the way, and some strewing the place with flowres, where the Triumph was to passe. Then rung the praises of the Conqueror: then was heard the mutuall gratulation for the safety of Africa . lighting from his Chariot, she thus spake: Before you offer these spoyles to the most fauourable god of warre, giue mee leaue, mighty King, to speake something to you, that you will by and by speake to the gods. By your valour are we safe: you haue restored vs to the free breath of the Ayre: you haue secured to euery priuate Subiect, his Lands, his Family, and his House; and to me my Crowne, and my absent Sonne. Aske of vs what you will: it will bee vnder your merit. O the Fates! What shall I say? I see you wounded, and heare you haue conquered with extreme hazzard of your life. You haue beene the Sacrifice, whose blood hath procured me the victory. Lo now, Radirobanes , so dreadfull of late to Africa ! now seeming by his Armour to be borne vpon your shoulders; and the neerer we were to danger, now, with the more pleasing horrour of his owne end, giuing vs comfort. Come, Royall Sir, to the Temples of the gods, whose number you will in time increase; and whether you be pleased with the hanging vp of these spoyles, to consecrate your vertue to the African gods, or to send ouer so glorious monuments to be offered to the gods of France ; know yet, nothing shall stay mee from erecting you Altars, with a holiday and priests, saue onely, that I wish you may long remaine with vs on earth. This speech was receiued with much applause of the people; amongst whom, Poliarchvs , after such modest reply to the Queene, as he thought fit, came to the Temple gates of Mars . It was against their religion, for one recking in the warme blood of his foe, to come neere the Altar, or to offer to the god. It was inough to deliuer the Trophees to the priest, and to inuoke the god from the outer doore of the Temple, that hee would be pleased graciously to accept them, and giue him meanes oft againe to offer like Presents vnto him. While he is in these prayers, hee finds himselfe by little and little more pained with his wounds: for, most of them now grew stiffe with cold, and swolne by the delay of looking to them. Yet, that hee might not affright the Queene and the Souldiers, he constantly dissembled his paine, saying nothing else, but that being weary with his toylesome labour, hee desired to take some repose. He goes therefore to the Court, with Hyanisbe in his company; both of them attended with many of the Souldiers, still remaining in the same habit they had fought in. But they were not yet come within the Palace gate, when newes was brought, of Embassadours come from the Sardinians . For, the Sardinians did extremely grieue, that their King, while he liued, had neither beene by them defended, nor now being dead, haue the honour to be intombed amongst his Ancestors: and then grew a feare amongst them, that his enemy would doe some shame to his dead body. So in this confusion, foure of the chiefe Nobility, rather of their owne minds, than by publike aduice, yet with some short deliberation of some of the principall amongst them, tooke vpon them this Embassie, and in the name of all the Sardinians , came to Lixa . These did Poliarchvs , with the Queenes permission, command to come, and deliuer their message in the very entry of the Court; as not pleased to grace so contemptible an Embassie, with hearing it in earnest, or at leasure, or in his Robes of State; but, as it were, hastily, and in his way. There was one of the Ambassadors, whom the rest had chose their Speaker: He, in well-couched Language, beseeches Poliarchvs to vse his fortune temperately, and neyther to set at light the gods of Sardinia , as conquered; nor to offend those of his owne with dishonourable vsage of his enemy. They were come for the dead body of their King. It was (besides) an ignoble anger, that went beyond death: and it was not a much vnlike prayse to haue the happinesse to take his enemies life, as to vse him nobly after his conquest. He should remember, that euen for the respect to the Royall dignity, example, he should not suffer his foes ghost to wander for want of Funerall: but if Achille's , the Sardinians would redeeme their Princes body at the highest rate. He fell at length to humble petitioning, and with teares expressing a manly courage, ended his speech. had the same Genius , the same gods to direct him in the moderation of his victory, that hee had to win it. But that, for such, whose owne wickednesse had made them worthy to dye, euen their deaths should not be without shame vnto them; vnlesse perhaps those gods, whom they so often mentioned, spared their ghosts after their death. All men trembled to remember Radirobanes his dishonourable act, who taking his opportunity, had broken the most firme League betweene Hyanisbe and him. And lastly, said hee, know, it is not in my power to grant your request. It is in the Queenes hands, whether she will be cruell, or mercifull: For her wee fought: and for her was Radirobanes with the victory gotten. The Ambassadours hearing this, now almost in dispayre of preuayling, turned to the Queene. But shee vtterly refused to vsurpe that power, that Poliarchvs had purchased with his bloud. With this long strife, whether of them should giue answer, they kept both themselues and the Ambassadours in suspence. But the paine, Poliarchvs felt in his wounds, admitted no delay: Hee knew besides, it was the royallest bounty, to giue presently, and without spending much time in thinking what to bestow. And therefore, when the Queene vrged him eyther to dispatch the Ambassadours, or giue them further day; I perceiue (Madam) said hee, what your meaning is: for if you pleased to take reuenge of your Enemies dead Carkasse for the wrongs offered you, you would take the blame of the discourtesie vpon your selfe. But now, besides your owne inclination to pitty, you would make mee the bestower of that fauour you meane the Sardinians . Let them then, if you will haue it so, take away the vnusefull trunke of their wicked King, and now throw him into those fires hee could not feele, that had beene fitter to haue receyued him quicke. Yes, said Hyanisbe , let them know, this is no Thebes : and that Poliarchvs , not Creon , is their Conquerour. And in the Epitaph to be set vpon his Tombe, let them record among his victories, that this City was twice entred by him. Thus speaking, with a little smile, she turnes from the Ambassadours; who at He himselfe hauing dispatched all publique businesses, and now no longer able to walke, was led by his Seruants to his Lodging: and scarcely staying to be vnarmed, threw himselfe vpon his Bed. Though hee had Phisicions of his owne, yet remembring there were excellent men of that profession in Hyanisbe's Court, and such as hee had experience of, when he was hurt by the Pyrates, he would also haue them called for. So two French-men , and two Mauritanians , were brought to him, and had a fearefull whisper amongst themselues, finding him farre more wounded then they imagined. The wound of the greatest danger was deepe in his side, and, vpon the search of it, put them into much doubt, whether it had entred the vitall parts. To the Queene, that asked their opinion of him, they answered in her eare, that they suspected the Kings well-doing. Shee wisely dissembling her feare, charges them to keepe it close, to auoid vprore in his or their Enemies Campe. Then incouraging the Physicians with large promises of reward, to leaue nothing vndone, that they in their knowledge and honesty thought, shee tooke heart to be her selfe present at the opening and searching of his wounds. He had lost much bloud (for, euen instantly vpon his casting himselfe vpon the Bed, a great flux of bloud broke out of all his wounds,) and the slow and vneuen beating of his Pulse, put them to an infinite feare: so, as the Phisicians stroue each man to doe his best. One of them, an African , Themison by name, a man of an almost contemptible presence, and low stature, yet very famous for his skill and fortunate successe in his practice; We spend our labour to no purpose, saith hee: I more feare the Kings death vpon another cause, then this flux of bloud: neyther must we thinke, that all the bloud that was forced by the Sword, and so remoued from his Vessell, hath quite left his body: but euen all the bloud in his veines, with too much agitation, is with the dregges ouer-heated out of temper; so it will, while it is yet hot and troubled, grow together to a blacke corruption; and so lying too heauy vpon the Lungs, take away his breath, and, if we take not the better heed, his life also. What is the remedy, you will aske mee? None else, but to open the Basilick veyne in his arme: and so the bloud hauing his free course, will be eased of his heat and chasing, which otherwise would bring it to corruption. All of them trembled at this speech. For with what hand, with what heart could they offer to draw yet more bloud from that spent body, that had now so little left to maintaine life? Yet the Physician preuayled, assuring them, that otherwise he could not liue. They therefore opened a veine with most fearefull and sad expectation of the successe: Then applyed they fit Medicines to the seuerall wounds; and so leauing him to his rest, gaue charge he should not be troubled that night with any noyse or businesse whatsoeuer: Yet could not farre from the Bed, shee euer and anon came to him to the Beds-side; sometimes afraid he had beene dead, and carefully feeling whether hee breathed; sometimes preuenting his Seruants best diligence, and looking to all things about him, who little knew by whom hee was so watchfully attended. At length Hyanisbe was, with much adoe, after the night was farre spent, perswaded by her seruants to goe to her owne Chamber. And much rest shee had not taken, before she was called vp by some of her chiefe Nobility, that came as well to gratulate her victory, as to receiue directions from her, what was now to be done vpon this new occasion: For, though all the night a great noyse was heard in the Sardinians Campe, yet in the morning neyther were their Ships seene in the Riuer, nor any Watch or Company before their Trenches. And presently some that were sent by Micipsa , to know the cause of this solitude and silence, brought backe newes, that all the Sardinians were gone, and, contented to carry away onely some of their richest Furniture, had left no small booty to the Conquerors. And at Sunne-rising, their Nauy might be seene afarre off, making amayne for their owne Countrey: for, hauing lost their King, Vertiganes , with the rest of the chiefe Commanders, now deuoyd of all counsell, not onely despayred of the victory; (for, to whose vse, or vnder whose conduct should they seeke it, being now brought to that passe, that they knew not what to wish, or feare?) but doubting withall, that they should not be able to keepe the fierce and conquering Enemy out of their Trenches. Besides, Sardinia , now like to be embroyled with ciuill warres, seemed to call backe her Souldiers: For, there were two left after Vnkles: whereof one was Harsicora , borne of the younger brother, but being the elder Competitour, he had hope his yeeres should beare it: the other was called Cornivs , who did not challenge in respect of his owne birth, but of his Fathers. Their hearts mis-giuing them, with feare of so much imminent mischiefe, when they saw besides, how the Souldiers hope and courage fayled, easily perswaded the Captaines, to giue charge thorow the whole Campe, without noyse of Drumme or Trumpet, for all men to gather vp their Baggage, and suddenly to put to Sea, without the priuity of the Africans . Many of the Nobles came to bring this happy newes to the Queene: which when she heard; Would to the gods, said shee, that he were capable of inioying this happinesse, that hath so dearely purchased it for vs. Ah, Poliarchvs , I beseech the gods, I haue not shortly more griefe for you, then I now haue ioy for the ouerthrow of my Foes. And withall she goes into Poliarchvs his Chamber, attended with some few of her Ladies and Nobles. There lay hee languishing, betweene sleeping and waking, with all the markes of mortall danger vpon him: yet could not all his payne and weakenesse enforce from him one groane or complaint. The same constant Maiesty and fortitude he shewed in his health, hee maintayned now almost dying: His speech indeed was weake and low, and could not be heard, but by those that stood close by him: and when he perceiued the Queene there; How now (Madam) said hee, is there yet any more trouble from the Enemy? If the gods be pleased to restore my health, I will reuenge their insolence: or if I am but a dead man, yet my ghost shall fright them away. In the meane while, let Micipsa haue the managing of the warre; and, if you please, Gelanorvs be ioyned with him. And this hee vttered, though with a low voyce, yet with such a hearty chearefulnesse, as the colour seemed to appeare much liuelier then before, in his cheekes. But, said Hyanisbe , there is no need (most excellent King) of any others armes: For, who were worthy to succeed your victory? You ended the warre yesterday, in Radirobanes alone, taking away the whole strength of all the rest. The Enemies are basely fled, taking aduantage of the night, leauing their friends vnburied, their Bulwarkes and Rampiers standing, and leauing the spoyles, that their haste gaue them not leaue to carry with them, to such as haue seized on them. fortunate successe. Hee would not therefore haue the people, that now went thronging, some to the Temples, some to the shore, some to feast one another, hindered in the expression of their ioy; though his recouery were still doubted of, and Hyanisbe had giuen command to stay any publique solemnity, till he himselfe should be able more to glorifie it with his presence. All Lixa was tickled with a vaine pride of entring the Enemies Tents, and sending curses after them from the Sea-side. Then they began to quarrell about the diuision of the spoyles; so as scarcely the more precious things were reserued for Offerings to the gods, and Presents to the Princes. But when Poliarchvs his wounds came againe to be opened and dressed, the chiefest of his friends stood about the Bed, heauily expecting, what hope they had, from the lookes of the Physicians. There was hee that had caused him to be let bloud the day before. Hee takes off the swathing-band from the most dangerous wound: for as yet they had not searcht it to the depth: yet they gaue their opinion of his state, and washed his wounds, and handled the weake and hurt places about him. But then, to the wonder of them all, the corrupt bloud appeared to be ripened into white and clammy matter. O the blessing of the gods, cryes out Themison ! Pay whatsoeuer you owe to the Heauens, if there be any here haue made any vow for the Kings safetie. Neuer to this day haue I seene so sure and sudden tokens of health. The Feuer is gone: the wounds are not onely free from inflammation, but asswaged, as it were, with time; the quicke and sound part separates and sends away that which is dead and corrupted. All of them hearkened to this speech, as to an Oracle from aboue: Some were almost out of their wits for ioy: Some fell to hugging those that were next to them: Some fell flat on the floore, commending the well going on of this Cure in their prayers to Apollo , to Æ scvlapivs , to Hecatombe to the goddesse of Africa , and yeerely solemnities; now indeed beginning first to take ioy of the victory. And she proclaymed, as it were, a generall Iubile , for three dayes together. Nicopompvs his Poem, which he called Soteria , though it were made long after, (for, hee being then absent, and in Sicily , could not yet come to know of these accidents) yet it will be worth his place here; because he solemnizes this sudden and vnexpected gladnesse, as if himselfe had beene present.  He liues! Why doe the thronging Starres make roome In Heauens for this deseruing Soule to come? Or faire Elyzium hope for such a Guest? This honour'd King shall liue, and th'earth be blest In him, who, by a Tyrants ouerthrow, The strength of France makes vanquisht, Sardo's know. A siluer bound from Stygian Field deuides That still-greene Groue, where blessed soules abide. In that sweet place, that torments neuer sees, Dwell war-like ghosts, whom faire-fam'd Vertue frees From punishment. Safe peace they now haue found: All former quarrels are in Lethe drown'd. From hence, while they secure looke downe to see The wofull parts of Plvto's Monarchy, His seuerall tortures, racking wheeles, and fire, And th'hissing snakie-heads of Furies dire; Behold, a fresh troupe flocks to th' Stygian shore, Their Swords yet holding, all deform'd with gore: And fierce they looks, as if in fight they stood. These the blest Heroes from th' Elysian wood Seeing, admir'd their number, and their looke, Their weapons, and those horrid wounds, that tooke Whole members off, greater than those by farre, That bloud-dy'd Simois washt i'th' Troian warre, When Greeke and Troian Hosts with various feare, Here great Achilles , greater Hector there, Scattring pursu'd. Then thus the Her oes spoke, What puissant arme could lend so great a stroke? What massy Sword could such deep wounds engraue? Our glorious Age did scarce beare men so braue. Let still the mortall Race in strength increase; And yet the gods not feare Olympvs peace. While thus they speake, a ghost of greater note Presents it selfe, which Charons labouring Boat Could scarce waft o're. Fierce is his visage still, But new descended this darke world to fill. As yet the markes of his lost dignity, His purple Robe and Crowne, reteyned he. In his right hand a Sword vpright he bore, But his chang'd face was all distayn'd with gore. His wounded brest and iawes, his breath's course turne. Straight a bold Lictor to the Iudges vrne Dragges him by force. The vulgar ghosts giue way. Him Minos doth with a sterne looke suruay. An awfull reuerence (though to such a looke That place accustom'd were) his countenance strooke. But he, commanded (nor could hee refuse) To tell, how hee had led, how hee did lose His life; what chance his ghost did thither bring; Remembring, that hee once had been a King, Vndanted speakes; (silent were Hell's darke caues, And Styx to heare, more stilly rowles his waues) If any chance haue made these Shades below, The name of Radirobanes to know, (For, hither oft whole troupes of enemies My Sword has chas'd, and tyr'd the Destinies;) Lo, I the man, whom Sardo's Court did dread, The Balearique Ilands honoured, And Ligurie late fear'd: Why doe I boast Of my now bootlesse strength, and armed Hoast, Since, after death, Kings finde no fauour here? Vertue alone preuayles. Why stand'st thou there? Oh, spare thy Whip, Enyo , I'le confesse. Trusting (alas) too-much the happinesse Of my Crowne, youth, and fortunes, I forgot I was a man; the gods I honour'd not, Nor kept my faith. My selfe a god I thought: My will was vncontroll'd, and no man taught Mee what I was. My seruants too too ill Flatter'd, applauding my bad actions still. My rape intended on Sicilia's shore, My Lybian warre, my wishes euermore Boundlesse: what need I speake? But suddenly The vengefull gods, and enuious Destiny--- (And there hee sigh'd, and stopp'd.) Then, how he dy'd, Fierce Minos ask'd him, (O sad curbe of pride!) And what his Conquerour was? That man, quoth hee, Whom France is proud to call her King, slew mee: To whom the strength of ancient times may yeeld, And Fame: But mee, not vnreueng'd hee kill'd. Our Swords exchang'd some wounds, and much ado Hee had with life from these strong armes to goe. Now hee a pale and bloudlesse Conquerour lyes, Breathing his last, I thinke. Oh Destinies! Perchance already he is here below. This said, he lifts his pale face to and fro, As 'twere to find the ghost of his dead foe. The Iudge giues sentence then, and from the barre, The snake hayr'd Sisters dragge the Prisoner, Condemn'd, like Tantalvs , with vaine pursuit To gape at water, and mouth-flying fruit. Then through Elysium does a rumour goe Of Poliarchv's death. So spake thy foe: So the blest Soules both hope, and feare; For, thee They wish their fellow, or their King to bee. They promise thee more here, then Earth can giue: And in their thoughts th'ambitious ghosts doe striue, Who shall salute thee first, who first shall giue His Ayry hand to shake, and shew thee then The wayes, the woods, the ghosts of famous men. This Christall Fount shall bathe thy limbes; thy Bed This flowrie banke; these Bayes shall crowne thy head. So, (if in Hyanisbe's valleyes their bright King Haue wandred farre, and some shall tydings bring Of his returne,) the Bees so sudden ioyes Their waxie-houses fill with buzzing noyse: They swarme to th'dooores, and their small wings prepare To meet their Soueraigne in the murmuring Ayre. But, now, behold, through Hell's darke Region To change with Pollvx . Then, it chanc'd, hee came; Starre-like hee shone; his Temples crown'd with flame; In purple cloath'd; his face like Mars did looke: For Poliarchvs him the ghosts mistooke. And whil'st they all in troupes to meet him runne, They spie the glorious face of Leda's sonne. Now the deceyued ghosts their errour see; Yet round about him flocks th'whole companie; ( Cyllarvs reyn'd stands still, and takes suruey Of all the ghosts,) and all at once 'gin say; Tell vs (for, you on Earth this battell saw;) How fares that King, whom wofull Gallia Must part withall to vs? He for a space Admires, then laughs aloud with that bright face, Wherewith hee calmes the raging Seas, and cheeres With his knowne light th'affrighted Mariners: Heare mee, blest spirits, quoth hee: Hope not in vaine For ioyes, that doe not to your Groues pertaine. But with the like false hope the gods were caught: I saw his lookes; his valour, as hee fought, And pious strength: I saw his fleeting life Begin to fayle, and heard the gods at strife, In what part of the skie Iove should command His pure soule mixt with heauenly fires to stand; Whether in East or West hee should appeare, Or ioyne his splendour to the Northern Beare. Then thus spake Ivpiter ; Wee cannot now This worthy Mortall, as a gift, bestow On Heauen: For, him fierce warres on Earth doe call; All places haue not fels his force, nor all The yet vnpurged World's offences. See His feature rare! How well suits Chiualrie Those lymmes? How well suits Peace that looke so milde? No god, but would be proud of such a Childe. Would he were mine. Thou, wife, would'st pardon mee, And lend thy brest to nurse his infancy. Heau'ns milkie path had neuer then been knowne. But no one Age can call these ioyes her owne. Hee long shall flourish, long a young man liue, Long old; (so will the Fates) and t'earth shall giue Eternall issue, who t'his Throne shall rise, And their old age put off within these skies. Go, sonne; go, thou, whose learning on all grounds, All Plants obey, all sicknesses, and wounds: To his greene hurts thy choysest Balsames deale, That conquer death, and wounded gods could heale; When hurt at Troy my Mars and Venvs were, And the drawne sword of Diomed did feare. Vnfolded from his shape of Phrygian Snake, Let Escvlapivs now himselfe betake To Mauritanians Court. Nor need be there Our wrath againe, or killing thunder feare. We now are pleas'd, the Fates controll'd should be, If tyrannous to such a King as He. So spake great Iove ; when on the sicke King straight, Like a Physician, Phoebvs , gan to wait. With gentle hand closing his wound, hee stood, With vnseene water washing off the bloud. Now with his sonne, hee ioynes his skill and paines, And with Ambrosia fils the empty'd veines. Straight strength returnes in his exhausted brest, And palenesse vanishes: his new life blest In heauen he findes. Therefore goe on, deare Mates; Him in Elysian Musicke celebrate. Whether such vertue on the earth shall dwell, Or Heauen, or in your shades; hee merits well All good mens prayse and loue. Here Castor stayes: The happy ghosts a ioyfull murmur rayse, Which straight was answer'd by the glad consent Of Earth, of Seas, and of the Firmament. In this manner, some dayes were spent, not remarkeable for any new broyle, (for Poliarchvs had, sooner then any man expected, recouered his strength) till such time as the Letter that Argenis had sent by Arsidas , gaue Fortune meanes to make her selfe new sport.  A conference between Gobrias and Arsidas : They depart.  shore, whither they got for shelter after the storme, they began to aduise with themselues, what way it were best to take, or how to manage their businesse. A Fleet they had, and Souldiers; the Fleet weather-beaten, and wanting reparations; the Souldiers in health, and fired with desire of seeing their King. The place being a vast Countrey, and without ship-timber, could afford them no materials for new rigging their Ships: yet repayring their Nauy, as they could, they furnished themselues with water out of a Spring not farre from them: a rare and strange thing to finde in Africa . There was also plenty of Hempe in that barren soyle, that serued them well for tackling: and the contrary windes begun to grow calmer. But what Land, what Sea should they betake themselues to, not knowing, whither the tempest had driuen priuate to Gobrias ; This truth we flatter our selues with,  o Gobrias , of keeping secrets, would now be counted our fault, in case you shall so long hide your Kings purposes from mee, or I the effect of my Embassie from you; as to disable our selues to giue each other aduice how to doe best seruice to our Princes. And to what end is it for both of vs, with a vaine and superstitious silence, to conceale our businesse? Speake truely, Gobrias ; Is not this Nauy bound for Sicily ? And Gobrias now somewhat bolder for the others freedome of speech; But tell me, Arsidas , quoth hee, doe not you come from Argenis to Poliarchvs ? Both of them confessing the truth, and with close embraces, each assuring other to continue true to him, they withdrew themselues more familiarly, the freer to debate what they had to doe. Gobrias told him, there were very few of the Captaines that were borne in hand with the shew of a further voyage: but that the King had specially disclosed to him alone, that he came to make claime to Argenis , who was before betrothed vnto him, as well against some Lawes of Sicily , made in barre of Alliance with France , as against the King of Sardinia , an vnseasonable and vnwelcome Suitor to Argenis . Then Arsidas discoursed vnto him, how the Sardinians had left Sicily , but that Poliarchvs and Argenis were now in danger of a greater storme: for there was a Stranger, one Archombrotvs , to whom Meleander had assured his Daughter in marriage: That this mischiefe was to be auoyded only by the forces of the French : That Gobrias should make all haste into Sicily with the strength hee had: It would be much comfort to or if there were such necessity as could not brooke delay, she might get away with the same Fleet. But it was to be thought, Poliarchvs himselfe had got before them, and was either there already, or would be shortly. But, said he, if you come first, you may pretend you are bound for Greece , and send to got together your whole Nauy, that had beene dispersed by the storme: and I will send a Letter to Argenis , which you shall deliuer: the occasion, place, and your endeuour, will giue you meanes to speake with her: You know what honour it will bee to you with your King, to doe her seruice. My owne will not you beare vs company into your Countrey? You might make my comming lesse suspected to Meleander , and bring me to the speech of Argenis . Rather, said Arsidas , you shall leaue mee a Galley; with that will I coast about Africa , that in case your King be there put to Land out of the storme, the Letters in my charge may be deliuered, and he may by me be informed, in what case I left his affaires in Sicily . When they were agreed on this course, Arsidas with a swift and nimble Galley, set forward on his voyage. But Gobrias , with fifteene Ships, wherin, besides the Mariners, he had two thousand two hundred sighting men, bends his course towards Sicily . Neither wanted they wind to their purpose, though not fore-right, but so blowing from the West, as the side-wind serued well out of Africa into Sicily , and from Sicily for Africa . For, at this time, the Fates made speede to send Archombrotvs into Africa , with a strong Hoste of men and shipping, as well appointed for seruice, as time would giue leaue to prouide. For his Mothers seruant had in good time brought him Letters from her, wherein she gaue him to vnderstand, how Radirobanes was vp in Armes to inuade Africa ; and charged him with a Mothers authority, to put off his marriage, till after hee had beene there, and had conference with her. Though Archombrotvs almost lost himselfe in this double distraction, with rage against the Sardinians , and griefe for the delay of his marriage; yet was all Africa of lesse account with him, than his Loue; and hee was more hot vpon debating that point, why his Mother should take pleasure to haue him so long tortured, than by what meanes to beate backe the Enemy out of his Countrey. What would Meleander now thinke? and what Argenis ? How often had vntimely delayes ouerthrowne great attempts, and Fortune turned her backe, when she was not admitted at first? Chasing thus, and often to himselfe charging his mother with cruelty, he tooke a short time to asswage his passions. Then, after the first fit of griefe and fury was spent, now resoluing to execute vpo Radirobanes , whatsoeuer his anger had suggested, he goes to Meleander , and to this effect speakes to him: Would to the gods, great King, I had made my birth knowne vnto you, before the wrong done me by others, inforced mee to bee burdenous to Sicily : now I must both acquaint you with my Parentage, and be a suitor for your ayde to the preseruing of my Honour. Hyanisbe , Queene of Mauritania , is my Mother; she hath giuen me knowledge by her letters, that both she and her Countrey are threatned by a dreadfull enemy at hand. Although I must needs be moued with the hazzard of my Kingdome, yet am I strooke with more horrour at my Mothers danger. Besides, the Author of this mischiefe redoubles my anger. It is that against the life and liberty of you and Argenis , droue from hence, that now againe basely seekes the ruine of a woman. Neither would I feare what he could doe to Mauritania , but that he steales vpon them vnprepared. I will goe therefore, and, if you please to accept mee for your Sonne-in-law, guarded with your power; and send Radirobanes after Lycogenes ; and Sardinia shall serue Mauritania , and Mauritania shall serue Sicily : for, why should we proceed to the Marriage, before this warre be ended; in which, the present broyle, and the doubt of the successe will not suffer our ioy to be absolute? If we conquer, our Marriage will bee the more glorious with the pompe of a triumph: and if the Fates haue otherwise disposed, I would be loth delayed. Being full of such a multitude of thoughts, he stood amazed betweene ioy and griefe: yet first he imbraced Archombrotvs , whom, after mention of Mauritania , he loued better than before. That wealthy Nation, where hee had long before beene nobly entertained, did now the more endeere hee had so tenderly loued for his valour and vertue. Then he ascribes it to his notable piety, that he preferred the securing of his Mother before his owne marriage; not knowing how this was no voluntary inclination in the eager Young-man, but forced by his Mothers command. He knew withall, Radirobanes was his bitter Enemy, and thought it better policy to haue him fought with in Mauritania , than in his owne Sicily . The danger also of that Kingdome that belonged to firme affection was to be wonne by this courtesie, quickly perswaded him to take Armes. So, promising to ioyne with him in this warre, hee now giues him more publike and magnificent entertainement, as the Sonne of a Queene, and no longer dissembled his wish to haue him his Sonne-in-law; but professed himselfe glad of his Daughters happinesse, that should be married to so excellent a Prince. All which, Argenis tooke as presages of the Destinies hastening her destruction; yet was shee glad in this respect onely, that consider. Oh the variable affections of mortals! Now did Argenis secretly wish well to Radirobanes ; he now pleased her with his warre against Africa : she besought the gods to further his attempts; not so much that hee might bee Conquerour, as that hee might not be conquered but with the death of them both. But as soone as it was spred abroad, there was no other stay of the marriage of Argenis with Archombrotvs , but the warre onely that now was at hand in Mauritania ; instantly the people of all sorts and degrees had an ambition to doe him seruice. They stroue amongst themselues, who should quickliest furnish with Armour, Horses, and shipping. There were none of the young Noble-men, that did not offer their seruice in this warre; and by their free bearing their owne charges, and hastening him on to the voyage, seeke to endeare themselues to their new Prince. All this was death to Argenis , to whom many also came, to gratulate her good fortune, that should vnite Mauritania to Sicily , euer extolling Archombrotvs with praises; and with most vnseasonable and vnpleasing obsequiousnesse, beseeching the gods to prosper him, and grant him speedy returne backe againe. Nor wanted there Poets in so publike an affaire; one of whom, by Timoclea's helpe, hauing beene long acquainted with her, had accesse to Argenis , and little knowing how vnwelcome a Present he brought, presented her with these Verses;  His chaste Torch yet: Sterne Mars , flintier then are Thy Thracians ! 'gainst our ioyes why dost thou warre; With loue so sacred intermixing woe? Why blame me the gods enuy? These things show The Paphian Venvs loue. This Marriage-Feast With warlike Triumphs she would haue increast: And, seeming cruell, does a little stay Those long'd-for fires, to fire by that delay Their hearts the more. So, little water cast, Does kindle flames, and makes them rise more fast. Driue through the Skie thy Thracian Chariot, Mars , And view the dangers of these Lybian warres. There thou, of all the gods the valiant'st, lend Thine ayde; this Prince, the best of men, defend. While Venvs deckes the Bride in Sicily , Wondring a face so like her owne to see: Goe, wanton Cvpids , scud through th' Ayre amaine: A warre becomming calls you: nor in vaine Draw you your Bowes: Goe, but your Arrowes there Shoot not: the foes let your sterne Father feare. When you, return'd from Africke , Conquerors are, Empty your Quiners in a sweeter Warre. And certainely, this hastie preparation for the warre, helped Archombrotvs somewhat out of these turbulent broyles of loue and griefe. Sometimes he would praise his men, sometimes encourage them; often see them mustering with harmlesse skirmishes, against the time of the reall danger, and appoint Officers to make prouision of victuals, armour, and shipping. For not only the greatnesse of his succours, but the grace and honour would best appeare in his speedy bringing them on; that Hyanisbe might find, and Argenis vnderstand his valour. Within very few daies he had a Fleet ready in the Harbour, of thirty Galleyes. Twenty smaller Vessels attended for carriage of the Munition, and other necessaries.  A Discourse between Meleander and Timonides , touching Ambassadours and Secretaries of State.  well seene in affaires of State, with Archombrotvs , as Ambassadour to but what Hyanisbe and her Sonne attempted. The vicissitude of things, and the length of his Raigne, had gotten him, beeing a most ingenious man, much experience and wisedome. But amongst all other his affaires, hee euer tooke most care to make wise choyce of such whom hee sent in Embassies to forraigne Princes or States; holding them as so many veynes, that, according to their quality, inspired into the body of their Countrey a secret influence of health, or malady, out of the seuerall Nations of the Earth. He had experience, that where such men respected themselues aboue their Master, or their loyalty; the State, Honour, and designes of the Countrey, were either by silence or Treason discouered and betrayed: and when they were carried with a turbulent spirit, or vaine selfe-conceit, by beeing too bitter on the one side, or otherwise, by making things seeme worse than they are; they often raise stormes of things, that being small at first, do yet by mutuall wrangling, and out of accidentall and emergent causes, grow of necessity to greater broyles. But suppose, said hee, they be temperate men, yet vnlesse they haue quicknesse of wit, and be able to discerne the plots that are layed for them, they will not onely not discouer the counsels of those Nations to whom they are sent Ambassadours; but being caught with faire shewes, and complement, deceiue euen their owne Princes, returning either no true or no absolute relation. Besides this, Meleander tooke care, to haue his Ambassadours chosen fit for the disposition of that King or people to whom they were sent, well knowing, that likenesse of fashions and manners auailed much to the winning of friendship, and that men could hardly be close-hearted to such as they affected. Amongst these considerations, his care was farre more, whom he should send abroad for intelligence, than to whom to commit the chiefe rule at home in Sicily . And not hearkening to the commendation of his Fauourites or others, he vsed to shew himselfe offended, if any presumed, while hee was in these doubts and consultations, to propound the election of any friend or kinsman vnto him. But at this time he was more earnest in deliberating whom to chuse, that would bee truer to him, than to Archombrotvs , his new Prince. This secret consultation lasted two dayes, and then he resolued to commit this charge to were yet to learne, what care, what trust the name of an Ambassadour importeth, I would not load you with a burden you were too weake to beare. I will haue you goe into Africa with Archombrotvs , as my Ambassadour to place. What you shall deliuer to the Queene touching the Warre, her Sonne, and the marriage, you shall receiue present instructions from Cleobvlvs . This one Caution I my selfe will giue you, That you preferre no mans fauour before mine. Spare not to make me true relation how their actions prosper, what their affections, and what their strengths are. Neither feare, that this fidelity shall worke you any danger, if you write any thing to me, against their minds, whom you are loth to offend: for it is long since that I haue learned to keepe secret. those dangers might befall him in this employment. He knew well (for he was very familiar with Arsidas and Nicopompvs ) that Argenis did not fancie Archombrotvs : And then, how was it possible for him to manage this businesse to both their likings? But if hee should displease either of them, he thought, the offence would procure him farre more displeasure in the heart offended, then it would gaine him fauour with him to whom hee should doe seruice. Thus therefore he answeres the King; Neither doe I doubt, Sir, of your secrecie; neither doe I thinke, that Hyanisbe , or the Mauritanians will do any thing, that I need feare to make relation of. But Fortune is variable; so are the times, and men; euen you Kings are so also. If any such thing should happen, my whole fortune is not only in your power, but also at charge your Ambassadours to send their Letters. And I nothing feare the honesty of so great and worthy a man. But what if you commit this charge of receiuing Letters to any other? What, if he to his Deputies? And though this neuer fall out so; yet it will bee too much torment to mee, to feare it may bee so. This is no idle feare, said the King; yet if any such thing happen, you may safely acquaint mee with it, by your Letters written to my selfe onely. Alas, said Timonides , will not all men suspect, what this vnwonted manner of writing to you meanes? Or will it not procure me displeasure with derogate from his place and integrity? conceiuing, that what Timonides had spoken for himselfe, concerned the welfare euen of Kings themselues: and then more deepely casting in his mind the power of a Secretary, he bethought himselfe, not without horrour, what such a man, vpon the receipt of the Ambassadours Letters, might doe. Hee might, as the disposer of all affaires, make no relation to the King, but of such things as pleased himselfe. And in this liberty and power, what Leagues or Truce with Forreigners might not hee at his pleasure ouerthrow; or, beeing corrupted, make their iniuries and treacheries seeme lesse than they were? But if he haue a mind cunningly to auoyd the blame of his falshood, wherewith he might otherwise be charged, he might wrest all affaires by his report of them, and make euery thing better or worse, as he pleased; as if he had so receiued it from the Ambassadour. So there will be different relation of one and the same affaire from the Ambassadour to the Secretary, and from him to the King. In a small moment may a businesse be either attempted or auoyded; and out of the vehemency or remissenesse of the speaker, wee fancie to our selues a suddaine and strong imagination of the businesse spoken of, at the first hearing. And neighbour Princes also do oft vse to make men of such eminence their Pensioners, or (which is the surest way of vndermining) with a close kind of familiarity, to giue them such respect, as if they were almost their equals, that they scarcely vnderstand themselues to be drawne to the basest seruitude. If therefore they should be either wholly taken with these baites, or at least, after their fidelity thus corrupted, they should not oppose the counsels of that Prince, to whom they were so vnhonestly ingaged, and the Ambassadour abroad finds it out, what meanes should hee haue to giue notice heereof to the King? Shall he, forsooth, send the Letters to him whom he accuses? Shall he trust him with the carriage of his own crimes to his Soueraigne? Will he condemne himselfe with his own accusation? You will say perhaps, this happens seldome, and that there want not others of the Nobility, by whom also the Ambassadour may giue notice to the King of this Treason. But that will bee a dangerous way of accusation, (where the accuser or the accused must of necessity perish) to commit such a charge to men, who (be they neuer so secret, and almost tonguelesse) yet euer talke something too much; and not rather to guiltlesse and dumbe papers; that know not what they carry, and which the King onely may reade and suppresse at his pleasure. And what besides, if their offences be carried more couertly, or of lesse quality, or such as the Ambassadour does yet but make a doubt of? Shall then the credit of the Secretary be stayned by such an accusation, and men be picked out of purpose to, charge him before the King? There would bee no rest in employment, no security in Honour. And the Ambassadour will often rather neglect his duty, than hazzard the incurring of so great mens displeasure. But suppose the Secretary continue true and loyall; yet at least, in case (as often it chances) the Ambassadour differ from him in opinion touching the managing of the affaire in hand, and would let his King know, what he thinketh fittest to be done; how can this be brought to passe, if he haue none, but the Secretary alone, by whom to acquaint the King with his opinion? For the Secretary will neuer oppose or forsake himselfe, nor giue way to any aduice that makes against him; but be more ready to hate the Ambassadour, than any way to commend his opinion to the King. head, begun also to thinke of remedies against these dangers. Such, doubtlesse, was the worth of Cleobvlvs , as he was free from all suspition. But Kings ought not onely to set the Common-wealth in order for the present, but also for their posterity; and a great folly it were, to bestow so much respect and admiration vpon any one mans vertue, as to strengthen his publike place and office, if hee hath any, with too much and too free power, as if one were alwayes sure, that such honours and offices should light vpon deseruing men; where indeed such places are likelier to arme with their great power, the headstrongnesse of any bad men, that should come, either by their owne suite or the Princes errour, to enioy them. He therefore determined with himselfe, to charge the Ambassadours, that whensoeuer they writ to the Secretary, they should direct Letters also to the King; not tedious ones, nor troublesome with busines, vnlesse there were occurrences that others might not be safely trusted with the discouery of. By this meanes, the King should not be much troubled with so short Letters, and sometimes of small consequence; and the Secretary, not knowing what was contained therein, would sincerely report to the King, what the Ambassadour had written to him, and what his opinion was. Besides that, euen hee himselfe might be taken and accused, before hee were prouided for defence, without the enuy of the Ambassadour, his often writing to the King being no way suspected. And this might bee the better carried, if the King would euer presently reade the Letters he receiued, and charily keepe them from the view of others, as an assurance of his safety. For so, the Ambassadours should securely afterwards enioy their liberty of writing, and none know whether they had things serious or triuiall; to the end the King might haue the freer choyce and time to dissemble his intents, and take aduice. But this course was to be brought in by little and little; so as Cleobvlvs himselfe should hardly be able to perceiue it; and a faire way was offered to it, by this departure of Archombrotvs ; as if he would haue it seeme to bee in care and loue to him, that the King charged Timonides to write often to himselfe of Archombrotvs his health. He therefore priuately charges Timonides , that if there happened any thing fit for the King alone to know, he should write of it to him onely: and that his Letters might not bee suspected for his seldome and extraordinare writing, he should not faile to write to him euer when he sent to Cleobvlvs . With these instructions he dismisses him; and vpon the comming of Cleobvlvs vnto them, he againe charges Timonides to write often, not to Cleobvlvs onely, but to himselfe also, of the health and successe of Archombrotvs ; intending to vse the like pretences afterwards, whensoeuer he sent Ambassadours abroad to forraigne Nations, till it should grow into a custome, by the ambition of the Ambassadours, euery one affecting this more honourable entercourse with the King, by this familiar way of sending Letters.  King. His pretence to see Argenis .  take leaue of Argenis , and excused his departure; euen this also perplexed the miserable Lady, that hee did not yet finde himselfe to be slighted, and that she her selfe, with the opinion of her loue to him, had enriched her Enemy with so much wealth, and the affections of the Sicilians . She therefore slightly answered, that shee well liked his haste towards his Mother: for that none could be better than at his owne home. This plaine and bitter language nipped Archombrotvs ; and much more her looke  & gesture in speaking: but there was neither time nor place for complaint or expostulation: but rather, as if he had not perceiued that hee was bid goe away, he replyed, That Countrey was dearer to him, and he thought himselfe more engaged to it, where his Mistris had first seene the light, then where himselfe had. While he was speaking, Meleander came in; at whose sight, Fleet put to Sea. Hauing had some speech with the Nobles that were with him in the same Galley, he retired himselfe, as it were, to rest, and there gaue himselfe ouer to tormenting cares: for Argenis speech came againe with much horror to his memory. What should it be that had moued the Lady to this cruelty? That she did so in a manner scornfully put him in mind of his owne home, was it to vpbraid him for going away at all, or for that she directly scorned to marry him? Withall calling to mind, what faire or harsh language he had euer before receiued from Argenis , he could hardly gouerne his mind at variance betweene hope and feare. Then, in as much as the Augure had told him on the shore, that the gods fauoured his voyage: Oh griefe! was it so to be vnderstood, as if the gods forbade his returne, and with faire, indeed, but fatall winds, hastened his departure? Calling to mind these and such other arguments of sorrow; the remembrance of Poliarchvs most troubled him, of whom whatsoeuer Selenissa had discouered, he had now learned from haue his Sonne-in-law come to the knowledge of his Daughters affaires from his owne mouth, than from the tongue of Rumour. While he was thus in suspence amidst these various thoughts, yet Meleander gaue him some comfort, whom he knew to loue him entirely, and was the propounder of the marriage. But what was it in him that had so much displeased was That Poliarchvs , truely; whom, oh, said hee, if euer it be my Fate to meet withall, how much more willingly should I with this hand, and this Sword, rid both of loue and life, then Radirobanes himselfe? And certainely he deserues to dye vnder my wrath, that hath beene the cause of so much mischiefe both to me and the Lady; vpon whom, if hee had not wrought with inchantments, I, a man of so high birth, so rich a Kingdome, with so many testimonies of my loue, and (be it lawfull to remember it to my selfe) with no meane example of my valour, might haue wonne her. But where, or how shall I seeke him, that is sheltred with his owne meanenesse and obscurity? If hee were not a man farre below his sawcie hopes, he would not be so long absent, or thus in corners hide himselfe from Meleander's knowledge. Woe is mee! For if hee should fall into my hands, and be the subiect of my anger; euen by that reuenge I purpose vpon, I may peraduenture more incense the Lady against mee, who as yet standeth vnsettled in her affection: yet I am well assured, his life is my onely hinderance; and whether his death will be so or no, I leaue it to the gods. But certainely shee can hope for nothing from a dead man; and she will vnderstand, hee was the best man that got the victory. These and the like wilde resolutions Archombrotvs thus digested; and sometimes againe would grieue, hee had occasion of discontent with his old friend Poliarchvs : But he had as yet scarce sayled out fro ken of Sicily , when Gobrias cast anchor not farre from Syracusa , and sending a Herald to land, inquired where the King kept his Court. And when he heard, the King was then residing at a Castle by the Sea-side, called Eipercte , hee himselfe, with but one Gally, went to Syracusa , as it were, to make prouision of victuals. From thence, he sent some choise men to signifie to the King, that there was a great Nauy of the French , that were bound for Greece , and so from thence to Asia , were scattered by the tempest: That part of this Fleet would gladly expect their fellowes on the Sicilian Sea, in case they should be also driuen thither after their wandring. Their Generall himselfe desired admittance to the speech of the King: for hee should esteeme the sight of so great a Prince, a sufficient recompence for the storme that had cast him vpon that Coast. Meleander , as he was euer exceeding courteous, though he doubted, what so great a Fleet should make in Greece , yet being thus requested, hee refused not to speake with him. Gobrias then came, with not aboue twenty friends and followers: to whom Evrymedes was sent to meet him at his entry into Eipercte , and entertayned him in his owne house: and finding him of a braue and manly disposition, gaue no small commendations of him to the King. The next day, being brought to the Court, hee made good the prayse asked, vpon what designe France had set forth this Fleet, hee receyued not a simple and sincere answere. Therefore, fearing him to be a Spie, hee secretly placed an honourable Guard about him, to haue carefull watch vpon him, while hee dreamed of no such thing, neyther tooke himselfe to be any wayes suspected. But Gobrias was troubled with a greater care, by what meanes, or by whose helpe hee might speake in priuate with Argenis . At length, calling to minde some Purple he had in his Fleet, that Poliarchvs had prepared for her, (of which no Nation affords any of so rich a dye as France ,) he commands it to be brought him, that hee might therewith present the Lady, in signe of thankes for his noble entertainement. But she hauing beene long disquieted with no lesse care, often debated with her selfe, whether shee might presume to hope, that these Ships were sent before by Poliarchvs , while he prepared a greater Army. But resting a little vpon this comfort, againe shee falleth to her accustomed course of grieuing; so as shee begun euen to mocke her selfe, for cherishing the hope shee had conceiued. But why did Arsidas stay so long? Why did Poliarchvs fayle of his promise? Was the cause of his long stay in himselfe, or in Fortune? The limited time for his returne was past: She her selfe liued, not by any comfort from him, but by the misfortune of Archombrotvs , whom the warres had called into Africa . Ah, Poliarchvs , art thou valiant, and wise, and worthy to be loued, onely to my sorrow? Why did I euer see thee, or why didd'st thou loue mee of all others, to kill mee with so many deaths? If I had not knowne thee, I had bin wretched euen in that, but yet should not haue perceyued my wretchednesse. There want not those in the World, on whom thou mightest haue bestowed thy loue more happily. I suffer vndeserued punishment for thy many vertues, euery of which enforces mee, distracted, and perhaps despised, to my destruction. Woe is me! What if thou also be now tormented with like passions? What, if thou be ouer-charged with the griefe thou find'st in thine owne brest, and that misery thou conceyuest mee to be in? and art in doubt, lest I, more angry with thee than Fortune, should lay the blame of the Fates vpon thy selfe? Happy those Louers, that eyther haue speedy successe; or else are freed from the fraud and cruelty of the gods by sudden death.  the Ports of Sicily .  dayes in the Court, Evrymedes brought her word, that the French Stranger had brought her a rich Purple of French -dye for a Present. The Lady refused not to haue a fight of it, thinking with her selfe, that Gobrias deuised this way, to gaine accesse to her; and now almost assuring her selfe, there was more in hand, then Evrymedes dreamed of. Therefore at Gobrias his comming in, and shewing a Purple so rich, as might euen in the Tyrians breed enuy, Argenis could scarce see what was shewed her, nor speake settledly, nor minde those that spoke to her. So much had the fearefull expectation of hearing from Poliarchvs , surcharged all her senses; She could hardly forbeare to inquire first of the Stranger. But Gobrias comming closer to her, when hee saw all of them busied onely in viewing the Present, spake softly thus; That this Gift may be of some more value for the Giuers sake; it is sent from him, to whom you sent Arsidas . At this word, Argenis was ready to faint; so as after intertayning him with some other complement aloud, she requested him with a short whisper, to come that night to her Lodging. I will send for you (said she) when the Company shall leaue mee to my priuacy. Vpon this, Gobrias departed; and she began earnestly to prayse the fairenesse of the Purple to her Women, and then to extoll the richnesse of it, and thus said to Timoclea ; I can hardly beleeue, this Present is bestowed vpon mee for nothing. I should rather thinke, this Stranger hath some suit to the King, and by this Gift seekes for my assistance: for hee besought mee, that at my leisure I would vouchsafe to admit him to further conference. I will this day rid my selfe of this businesse; that if hee hath any request fit to be obtayned, I may promise him my furtherance: but if otherwise, that I delude not the Petitioner with vaine hope, nor send him away vnrewarded to the full value of the Purple. Not long after, shee retyred into the Garden, wherein (by chance) there were no company, the King then being gone on hunting. Wherefore, taking the oportunity of the time, and the closenesse of the Arbour, shee commands Garden. He fayled not her, nor himselfe: and when he had openly answered her to diuers ordinary questions, falling, as it were, by little and little to other discourse, they began to withdraw themselues, and walke alone. Then Gobrias ; O Lady (said he) worthy not onely of your owne France and Sicily , but to be Queene of all the Kingdomes in the whole World, pardon my King, that you see mee here before him. An vnwelcome tempest is the cause of his stay; which hath driuen him, as he was bound hitherward, with the rest of his Fleet out of his course. We also were cast vpon Africa , my selfe, I meane, and Arsidas , who happened vpon mee the day before the storme. And he indeed is now coasting about Africa , in search of your Poliarchvs , to deliuer the Message you sent him with. But I sayled hither, that in case my King also should meet mee here, I might ioyne with the mighty Army hee brings with him: or, if we must wait longer for him, to offer vp this little Fleet to your selfe. Wee simply await your pleasure: vse our bodies as you please: I know, you are She alone, in whom my Soueraigne may be truely honoured or neglected. Thus saying, he deliuered her Arsidas his Letters, wherein was contayned the same in effect, with Gobrias his relation. Which hauing read, as Loue is neuer quiet, What then shall wee thinke, said Argenis , is become of your King? If hee were not cast away in the storme, doe you thinke hee would haue beene behinde any other man, in bringing newes himselfe of his comming? Here Gobrias , though himselfe were not free from the same feare, yet alledged many reasons to auert her from suspicion of shipwracke: for (saith hee) he sayles not with two or three Ships onely: there are more than fiftie Ships  & Gallies in his Company. Though the storme (which the gods would neuer suffer) had cast away the Admirall, yet would not so many Mariners, so many Souldiers, offer their hands and shoulders, so helpe their dearest Prince into the next Ship for his safety? But it cannot be thought, that eyther his whole Fleet should be swallowed vp of the waues, or that those which escaped the Seas fury, would not before this time haue brought vs the sad newes. Fame is euer quicker, with a base gladnesse, to bring vs harmefull newes, then such as we desire. To conclude, that we may not shew cruelty to our selues with needlesse feare, consider but these Gallies which I haue brought with me. They suffered the same storme with the King: yet hath it cast none of them away. I therefore imagine, the King is eyther cast vpon some remote Coast, or stayes some-where, to repayre his tackling and prouision, that is spoyled with the force of the winde: for he prepares not onely for sayling, but for warre by Land. Within these few dayes (mightie Queene) you shall see the Coast of Sicily swarming with most braue and valiant men, who shall with their forwardnesse to doe you seruice, vpbraid your Enemies, if you haue any here, that they haue beene slacker in doing honour to your vertue, that were borne amongst them, then we Strangers. The Lady much erected with this exceeding comfort, was neuerthelesse still doubtfull of Poliarchvs his safety: She had a great minde further to question Gobrias at large, as well touching many things shee knew, as of things she knew not: for, while the discourse was of Poliarchvs , the power of loue made both serious and triuiall matters pleasing. But the time cut off their talke, it being now darke euening, and the curiosity of her attendants, that were whispering amongst themselues, what all this long discourse with the French -man should meane. Wherefore, as he againe was offering her his seruice; I will (said shee) better consider, what is to be done for the good of your King. Be you often with Evrymedes , to whom my selfe also will commend your friendship: but pretend you some befitting and probable causes not to depart from our Coasts; and I will second them to my Father: and I will also easily finde meanes, you may often come and speake with me without suspicion. After his departure, Timoclea asked what his businesse was. No great matter (said Argenis ) vnlesse, perchance, he haue not yet opened his minde, and was loth to be troublesome at the first. Hee commended his bounteous entertainement: and as a Suitor, that one of his Ships, wherein his richest lading is, might be receyued into the Harbour, not to stay aboue two dayes, in which time, something that was almost spoyled by the storme, might be repayred: and for that, he besought mee to assist him in his Suit to the King. With this, the Lady with-drew her selfe into her Chamber, and sending for And the better to dissemble her intentions; I purpose (said shee) to bestow some gifts vpon him, not inferiour in shew or value to those he gaue mee: and vntill I haue bethought my selfe of such a one, looke you, that he make not ready for departure. You may easily winne him to a small stay, eyther by inuiting him to hunting, or with promise of some publique shew. Once againe I wish you take heed, Evrymedes , that he goe not away without my knowledge. Hauing sent him away with this charge, and the night, vnder shew of rest, had renewed her cares, then begun she to cast in her minde all chances, to take aduice from the businesse it selfe, and more daringly then before, like a Queene indeed, to grieue. Both Gobrias his Fleet, and Arsidas his Letters, strongly assured her, that if Poliarchvs were liuing, he would not be long absent: She must therefore seeke meanes to keepe her selfe aliue for him. But if he were dead, she resolued not to liue. But what ground, what pretence should way necessary for the bringing her owne resolution to passe: for so shee had decreed; If Archombrotvs should returne, before certaine newes were brought touching Poliarchvs , she would eyther steale priuily to these Ships, and so go for France , or else by raysing a faction amongst the Sicilians , keepe her selfe from the marriage that her Father would inforce her to. At last, not vnwisely, shee framed this plot: She goes the next morning early to Meleander , and lamenting the weake estate of Sicily , tels him, she much feared, lest Radirobanes , hearing that , should once againe, in pursuit of his rape, eyther come himselfe, or send some of his Forces to make warre against Sicily , vnprouided for defence. There was therefore no safer course to be thought on, then, for pay, to hyre the French , whom some fauourable god had brought vnto them, to guard their Coasts; that if any warre should happen, Sicily might redeeme it selfe from danger, with the losse onely of the bloud of Strangers. It would be but one moneths businesse, within which time they should heare certaine newes both of not yet well refreshed and furnished after the storme, would willingly hearken, vpon promise of pay, to so short a time of abode there: who are not so few (said she) but they are able to helpe vs; nor of that number, that they need to be feared of the Sicilians , in case they should in stead of Aydes, proue Traytors. When she had put her Father into much fright with these speeches, shee priuily sends for Cleobvlvs and Evrymedes . She vrges her feare of Radirobanes : She shewes them the French Forces at hand, that might be procured at an easie rate. And when they argued to the contrary; for that it was neyther safe to trust Strangers, nor that Sicily wanted men; Sicily , yet will I haue it to secure me from my feare. I haue already brought the King to my opinion: and he shall neuer haue good thought of me, that perswades him to the contrary. Neyther of them presumed with an vnseasonable wisdome, to contradict her pressing it so earnestly. And now it was their ambition to be the first propounders to the King, especially when Coasts. Well, said hee, since you thinke it fit, doe you, Evrymedes , speake to him: Know, whether hee can make any stay with vs. We will after see, vpon what conditions. Evrymedes doing his charge, found Gobrias not hard to be intreated; well knowing, this was a plot of Argenis . Hee therefore promises the seruice of his Nauy for a Moneth; onely something offended with the mention of pay: for, that hee might be the better thought of, hee offered his free and voluntary Guard, as in pledge of his loue and gratitude. In this state was Sicily , while Arsidas coasteth about all parts of Africa with his Gally, and passeth into euery Creeke with his Boat, inquiring of the Countrey-people, if any-where about those Coasts, they had discouered a Fleet of Strangers, or whether the storme had driuen any mortall at all vpon their Shores. And now was hee wearied with his lost labour, and especially not enduring the heat, which the South-winde, gliding ouer the scorching Sands, afflicted him with; when it most fortunately happened him to fall vpon the Coasts of Mauritania , and to put into Harbour, by which was a Towne within a mile. So it chanced, that the Gouernour of that Countrey was then walking within the Hauen; a man, aboue others, approued for his wisdome and valour. Hee seeing Arsidas , whom his habit and countenance shewed to be a Stranger, saluted him with all courtesie, and as well in respect of his place, as of his owne humanity, inquired of his Countrey and businesse. And when Arsidas , to auoyd long discourse, and because hee came thither in a French Ship, told him hee was a French-man , the Mauritanian instantly falls vpon him to imbrace him; and (said hee) it is enough, my deare Guest, to heare but the name of France . Wee owe you all our fortunes. Come (I beseech you) into this City, and whither-soeuer you are bound; first refresh your selfe after your hard Sea-voyage, and new victuall your Gally. forreine and vnknowne Countrey. He therefore commands his men to land: and himselfe going on the right hand of the Gouernour, and honoured by all men, set forward towards the Towne. But fearing, that he should by further discourse be discouered not to come from France , and so by a lye to win a fauour that was due to others, he briefly told him, that he was indeed a Sicilian ; but because he was in a French Gally, and besides, came in search of the King of France , he had, when he was first questioned of his Countrey, called himselfe a French-man . What (said the Gouernour) and doe you then seeke after him, without whose helpe all we Mauritanians had bin slaues to Strangers? This was strange newes to Arsidas , that knew nothing of all that might longer mistake, he earnestly demanded, what newes had happened, or what courtesie the Mauritanians had receiued from France : for, himselfe hauing bin driuen by the windes vpon the furthest Coasts of Africa , and long wandring vpon the Sea, knew nothing of this. Then began the Gouernor eagerly to discourse, with what insolence Radirobanes had begun the War, and how the French King had come, as it were at a day appoynted, and brought by the gods with his Army: And so on to the successe of the warre, and the various aduentures that had chanced in so short a time. But he dwelt long vpon the death of Radirobanes ; what a sharpe combate it was, how it stood long doubtfull, and lastly, how euen the Conquerour was not a little wounded. But when he had with his discourse struck Radirobanes to the ground vnder the hand of the French King, Arsidas could no longer so dissemble his ioy, but that his lookes discouered, that his gladnesse was not counterfeit. Is from Sicily ? And by the King of France ? To whom, that I may not in vaine gratulate his good fortune; tell mee (deare Sir) his name. Then replyed the Mauritanian , He hath two names, by which errour I haue been often mistaken my selfe, and haue seene others deceyued: for sometimes his Subiects call him the Mauritanians that accompanyed him, were taken with the sweetnesse of his passion. He remembred not his cares, his trauels: onely, he asked, as if hee had talked with the gods, What Fate, what Chance had brought these two enemy- Kings into Africa together? or what god had so ordayned, that the bloud due to the Sicilians , should be shed for the good of Africa ? Then comming to himselfe, out of the consideration of these accidents, inquires, whither Poliarchvs had betaken himselfe after his victory? But Ivba (so was the Mauritanian called) replyed, that he was yet in the Royall City of Mauritania , not throughly recouered of his wounds; and that a man might ride thither with a good Horse in foure dayes.  The diligence of Arsidas : He is courteously receiued by a Gouernour: He learneth newes of Poliarchvs . A maruellous inuention to keepe Snow in Summer. Arsidas falleth sicke: He loseth Argenis her Letters.  for Guides, to shew him the way to the Court (for, the winde begun to grow rough againe, and hee feared, a new storme might make him misse of would not suffer him to goe, before they had both together cut out the Sacrifices entrayles to Hospitall Ivpiter . It was Summer, and Arsidas being brought to an Arbour of the Garden, stayed vpon the couered Bed, for the comming in of the Meat, the time seeming short with Ivba's pleasant discourse of the warre, and Poliarchvs his victory, till at length the Table richly furnished, brake off their discourse, and they sate downe to Dinner. And Arsidas wondring at the suddennesse and abundance of the Cheare, yet obserued nothing more exactly, then to see amongst the Cups and Vessels, certaine Apples of seuerall sorts, in such manner kept in Ice, as that part of some of them appeared higher then it, and some of them, though wholly inclosed, yet were transparant in their natiue colour, through the cleare shining Ice. Amazed at this nouelty, he knew not what to thinke: for certainely these Apples were fresh: and againe, the water did not freeze at that time of the yeere. Then, that he might not be deceyued with a false representation, first, he feeles the Ice with his hand, that made his fingers ends so cold, he could not doubt but it was reall water, and truely congealed with Ice: and after tryed the Apples in his mouth, which also retained their naturall taste, but that they chilled the Palate with extremity of cold. eat, and leaue his admiration. But Arsidas smiling, asked him, by what deuice he had gotten Ice out of Scythia , to keepe his African Apples in. That you may wonder the more, saith Ivba ; when you entred the Garden, these Apples were hanging on the Trees, and the Water, that now is Ice, ranne out of the Spring. Spell, or in what Caue, Nature could so suddenly change her selfe. This, quoth the Gouernour, is a new tricke to call backe Winter by Art, in the middest of Summer, which I shall haue better leisure to tell you, after you haue tasted the Wine. There was an  Ægyptian Boy with sweet Wine, which hee brought in a Cup made of the same Ice. The wine being drunke off, the Boy dasheth the Cup against the ground: whereat Arsidas being grieued, that so precious a Cup for Summer, though of brittle matter, should be spoyled; Be not angry, said Ivba : at euery draught we vse new Cups, and hold it base to see one and the same twice at the Table. so neere the truth of Nature, when presently was brought before them many Patternes of seuerall shapes in Brasse. There was a shew of Trenchers, Drinking-bowles, Chargers, and all sorts of banquetting Vessels. These, said for, euery of them is so couered with his Lid, as the brimmes sticke close together, saue for a narrow hole, by which the water is powred in, after the fashion of melting Tinne or Lead. Then we put them on a woodden Vessell, whose bottome is couered first with Bay-salt a little bruized, and then with Snow, which wee haue alwaies at hand, kept pure in straw the whole yeere long in the bottome of deepe Sellers. Then vpon the moulds, which wee place in the bottome, we strew rankes of Snow, with Bay-salt betweene euery ranke. So, the water put to freeze in these Brazen Vessels, receiues the cold of the Snow on all sides, and congeales to Ice, which the Salt, by reason of its sharpe mixture, suffers not to dissolue, chiefly in deepe and coole Sellers, such as we digge to keepe Wine or Oyle in. In three houres space the water congealeth: and if we put in any Apples, such as now breed your wonder, they sticke closed in the Ice. To conclude, this kinde of coolenesse is a welcome refreshing to vs in the extremity of Summers heat, and something the more pleasing for the nouelty of it; being but lately and happily found out by some luxurious palat for satisfying his curiosity. eagerly vpon his weake stomacke, and too freely drunke of these Cups of Ice; the extremity of the cold, as it often happens, increasing his thirst: though they were risen from Dinner, and Arsidas was iestingly discommending the vse of hot drinkes, hee felt all his sinewes, by little and little, to faint with extremity of cold; insomuch, as casting vp his meat, his life had almost followed. thought to haue wittingly giuen him a Drinke to bring him to his death, spared no paynes: He cheeres vp Arsidas , vrges the Phisicians, and earnestly intreats both Arsidas his seruants, and his owne, to be carefull of him. But as report euer makes things worse then they are, it was quickly bruited abroad, that Arsidas was at poynt of death. While his followers and seruants are amazed at this sudden misfortune, a certaine hyreling of his, of the Colony of the Eub aeans , that in Campania first built Naples , hauing gotten fit time and place, stole away from him no small booty. There was a Bagge of fine Linnen, that Arsidas vsed to keepe next his body, vnder his apparell. The Greeke had long before guessed, that in it was something of great value kept. And as the sicke-mans Clothes were pulling off, and himselfe past sense, this fellow comes, vnder colour of doing him seruice, and closely steales the bag from him, and (while the rest were otherwise betweene loue and feare busied) conueyes himselfe away.  to Poliarchvs : and what he got by it.  recouered his speech, hee enquired of the Phisicians, what they thought of his danger, and when he should be able to trauell. They told him, there were many signes of his recouery: but that his stomacke and his Sinewes, which beeing disordered with extremity of cold, had dispersed the Feauer through his blood, required some time of rest: he should thinke himselfe well, if his sicknesse hindred not his iourney aboue foure dayes. He repining at the gods, that he should be forced to stay at such time, turnes to Ivba : Yet, said he, it were a sinne, by my mischance, to keepe the Letters from King Poliarchvs , which I haue to deliuer him. If you please to let me haue a guide to the Court, I will presently send one of my people with them: so shall I stay heere with more patience, till I be able to trauell my selfe. Ivba liked this well, and told him, there was a guide at hand, to accompany whomsoeuer hee would send to the Court. Then Arsidas searched for his Packet, wherein hee had put Argenis Letters. It was the very same, that the fellow had stolne from him; which, when he wondred how it should be taken from him, and each man denyed he had seene it, his raging anger instantly supplyed him with fresh strength. In spight of the Phisicians, he leapes out of his bed, and threatens his seruants to kill them, if they did not presently bring him his deare charge. He pressed this question like a mad man, calling vpon gods and men: and not without suspition, earnestly eyes the Mauritanians that were about him at his first falling sicke. Then againe searching his apparrell; sometimes tearing that, and sometimes his haire, he asked which of his Seruants came about him in his sicknesse. But they had beene all with him; and held it their duties to be neere him in that extremity. And now the same violence of passion, that before had giuen him strength, cast him downe weaker than at first. Hee could hardly bee recouered to speech with strong odours and perfumes: which when he once had gotten againe; Though Fortune forsake me, said he, after being vndone with my sicknesse and the vilany of theeues; yet will I not be false to my selfe, nor my Princes. Reach mee Inke and Paper: I will presently write to the King; and within these two dayes, though with neuer so much danger of my life, I will begin my iourney, being put in a Horse-litter: Call me hither Phorbas instantly; I will haue him set forward to day with my Letters. O Fortune! It was that very Phorbas , that had stolne and runne away with the Packet. Some were presently sent, both to the Ship, and about the Towne in search of him, but bring backe word, that all their labour was lost. Arsidas instantly suspected him to be the Theefe; yet dissembling his iealousie, hee charges some about him, to goe backe to the Hauen and the Market-place, againe to seeke him; but all in vaine. Straight- wayes he calls to Ivba , and causing the rest to withdraw themselues; I am, said hee, either much deceiued, or the treachery of my own seruant is the occasion of my sorrow. For, why should hee hide himselfe, especially at such a time, when I am sicke, and in danger of death, but that hauing played the Theefe, he is running away, not from me onely, but out of Africa also? If yee loue Poliarchvs , reuenge the wrong this villaine hath done him. Send to the next Ports, to take order, that no Stranger be suffered to take shipping. But this search must be done with all secresie and discretion; lest, if hee come to know there are searchers abroad for him, he find out some tricke to escape. I will all this day keepe it from my owne seruants, that I haue any ill suspicion of him, that so we may deceiue his partakers in the theft, if by chance hee haue left any behind him. Ivba promises him his best care; and straight writes, as hee thought fit, to the Gouernours of the next Hauens, about it. But Phorbas suspected this before; the remembrance of his knauery ministring him cause of feare, and withall sharpening his wits. Hauing done this robbery, he knew not yet what he had stolne; and therefore sought out a secret place to ouerlooke his bootie; intending, if he found nothing worth his falshood and his danger, to carry all backe to Arsidas , as if he had, in his sicknesse and danger, taken his Packet from him, to keepe it the safer. But see! as he opened it, he found a little chaine of Diamonds, each of equall bignesse, fastened with linkes of gold. Then were there three Rings with rich stones, folded vp in a small linnen, each by himselfe, to keepe the workmanship from being defaced, by rubbing one vpon another. Some few pieces of gold there were in the bottome; all which, Arsidas euer wore about him, against all chances of Fortune. Besides these were the Letters there, farre dearer to Arsidas , than all the Treasure that Argenis had sent to knauery in the purchase of the gold and Iewels: but the Letters troubled him exceedingly. He read the superscription to Poliarchvs ; but from whence, or from whom, hee could not imagine; and was in feare, they might giue occasion of more stirre and search after him, than either the gold or the Iewels. Hee durst not goe to any Port-Towne, assuring himselfe they were all laid for him: and the Land promised as little safety, nor any meanes to escape out of that Countrey, as he desired, into Europe . At last, his owne fact, and his danger, droue him in this perplexity, to another and a more desperate course. He would goe himselfe to the Court, and deliuer these Letters to reward of trust and honesty. Thus, when he had cast the whole plot in his head, and how to carry the lye cunningly, he goes to the next Towne, and there enquires the way to the Court, and getteth Post-horses for himselfe and his guide. The third day he came to the sight of the City from the toppe of a Hill; then sending backe his guide with his horse, he goes alone to the watch; and with a sad looke (for hee had runne himselfe out of breath of purpose) he told them with much eagernesse, that he had businesse of much haste to King spoken with; for hee was but newly falne asleepe after his long watching. But newes which required all haste. Beeing asked what hee was, he replyed, Hee should freelyer giue account to the King. I come, said hee, from Sicily , and bring him Letters; and (woe is me!) I am afraid, you will, by delaying mee, preiudice my businesse, about which I come, and for haste am almost breathlesse. To heare the name of Sicily , and of Letters from thence, and the messengers feare and importunity shewing it to bee some businesse of moment, seemed to came he but softly to the beds side, for feare to affright the attendants that should be rowzed from their sleepe, and were still doubtfull of the successe, at the Kings first waking. Therefore a little coughing, and treading somewhat lowder, he thus spoke vnto him: Heere are Letters, Sir, come from Sicily ; and the messenger makes extraordinary haste. Poliarchvs stayed not to heare more, but hastily sate vp in his bed,  & commanded the messenger to be brought in Phorbas then with wondrous confidence enters the Chamber, which next to the gods he should haue feared most, and begun his plotted Tale, which he well set forth, as well in words, as in his looke and gesture, to this effect: I am, said hee, great King, one of Arsidas his friends: He, trauelling to you out of Sicily , brought me along with him. After long enquirie, at last, vpon report of your victory, hee bent his course hitherward. Neither were we farre from the Coast, when Pirates with three Barkes set vpon our Ship. Few of vs were armed, and the most were of opinion to yeeld, before any blow giuen. Arsidas thus betrayed, yeelded himselfe with his men and baggage into their power. But they, not contented with the spoyle of all we had, sought still for more booty: and the chiefe of them holding his Dagger at Arsidas his brest; I perceiue, said hee, by thy habit and thy furniture, thou art a man of great wealth: and therefore, except thou forthwith deliuer mee three Talents ouer and aboue the price wee haue taken, I will vnbind thee (for they had already chained him) and when I haue cut thy throat, throw thee ouer-board. Alas, replyes Arsidas , how should I haue three Talents in ready money, that haue not so much as my liberty left mee? Yes, quoth the Pirate, when I enquired whither thou wert bound, thou told'st me, to the Court of Mauritania . Certainely, thou canst not be there vnknowne. I will set at liberty which of thy people thou wilt, vpon this condition; That vnlesse hee come backe hither within three daies, with the summe wee demand, thou shalt assuredly dye. Neither thinke thou to put a tricke vpon vs, or to send for any to rescue or reuenge thee: we are at anchor heere, from whence wee can discerne all shipping; and the place is such as secures from all danger, both by Land and Sea. If hee thou sendest, bring any with him, but himselfe, it shall cost thee thy head. Nay, if any shipping shall in the meane time passe this way, though but by chance, thou shalt suffer for our ill fortune. When he had ended this wicked and barbarous speech, Arsidas , much deiected, and looking ouer and ouer vpon all of vs, at last called mee vnto him: and, See, my Phorbas , said hee, what confidence I haue in thy honesty: I depend wholly vpon thy diligence. Goe to King Poliarchvs , and shew him in what state I am. He will not spare for three Talents to saue my life. And, to put him out of doubt thou speakest truth, take heere these Letters, (and withall, tooke them out of his bosome:) they are sent vnto him. It nothing concernes thee to know who writ them. I giue them thee to carry, not so much for a token thou comest from mee, as that the Letters may not miscarry, in case these Pirates deale vnmercifully with mee. With this charge, mighty King, I am come vnto you since yesterday at noone, and haue iust so much time limited for my returne, if euer you will see Arsidas aliue. With these words he deliuers Argenis her Letters to Poliarchvs , as sent from Arsidas ; which when hee perceiued sealed, and knew Argenis her wonted seale in the waxe, he trembled betweene ioy and feare. Yet, withall, being much moued with Arsidas his danger, while he opens the Letter; Oh, what mortall soeuer thou art, said hee, to whom Arsidas his life is entrusted; if thou beest diligent, and restore mee him; beleeue it, thou carriest not onely three Talents to the Pirates, but winnest infinite wealth to thy selfe. So well shalt thou finde, I will bee mindfull of thy courtesie. Doe you, Gelanorvs , make all speede to deliuer him so much gold as shall be needfull. It is time it had beene told out already. Goe, and dispatch, lest the Pirates grow more crabbed with the stay. But what thinke you, may wee with Arsidas safety, send in pursuite of these Theeues, and bring them out of their Ships to the gallowes? Phorbas started at the mention of the gallowes, which he knew, himselfe had deserued: and holding vp both his hands, with an earnest looke, said. Take heed, great King, take heed you cherish not any such conceit. The Pirates haue light and speedy Barkes: they hull where they haue Sea-roome enough: and questionlesse, they would cast your Arsidas dead ouer-boord, and (vnreuenged) slight so vnpreuailing an attempt. Now Poliarchvs opened the Letters, and read them. It was Argenis owne hand; but a most lamentable discourse. He finds the Treason and desperate end of Selenissa , and withall, Radirobanes his impious mind, that thought it no sinne to slander so chaste a Lady. But for him, it was his comfort, that hee was dead, and slaine by his hand. But what helpe against Archombrotvs , now that Meleander so hastened the marriage, and Argenis had but two moneths time to put it off? But when he cast his eye vpon the foot of the Letter, where it was dated, he now perceiued the time was past, wherein he must of necessity returne, or Argenis perish. Now he begins to condemne himselfe, to be angry with the storme, and curse Africa , for whose preseruation he feared he had vndone himselfe. But then hee turned all his imprecations, all his spleene towards Archombrotvs . I will liue, quoth hee, I will reserue my selfe onely for thy ruine, most hated Corriuall. I will not long out-liue Argenis , but will first haue the comfort of thy death. Nay, we will bee at enmity euen after death: I will neuer grant nor accept of friendship. While his heart throbbed with the heate of his anger, he began against his will to doubt, whether Argenis resolution would continue to that promised constancy of dying. For, how naturall was it for vs all to loue life? How welcome is that hand, that puts by a dagger bent against our brests? Finally, suppose, Poliarchvs , said he, she be enforced to this marriage; suppose her Father remaine obstinate, and that the day of all thy miseries be come, canst thou find in thy heart to haue Argenis perish? Beeing much more troubled with these violent passions, than with his wounds, he causes Phorbas to be called to him, to whom the gold was deliuered, and much blamed the slownesse of that voyage, for that Arsidas had ouerslipped the two moneths, and was not yet come. But he made him true relation of all their lets by the way; how they were forced to stay at Cuma ; how they had chanced vpon Gobrias ; and how their Fleet was driuen by the storme from Italy into Africa . Poliarchvs was as glad as his griefe would giue him leaue, to heare of Gobrias , and asked what was become of him. I know not, quoth Phorbas , but that I heard he was gone for Sicily . These words put the afflicted Louer in some hope. But, said Him taken from you, Sir, by the Pirates, that can giue you much surer relation than I am able. Poliarchvs exceedingly praised this seruants honesty, and causes him to haue a fourth Talent deliuered him; for, Arsidas , after his discharge from the Pirates, might haue occasion to vse it. He deliuered him also a Horse of excellent speed; vpon which Phorbas mounting, made all haste to passe ouer Mauritania , and at some remote Port to make escape priuily with his booty.  Court of Mauritania , and is much troubled at the mention of Phorbas .  wounds, yet no longer to deferre his voyage into Sicily . For, he might rest in his ship, and carry along with him all necessaries for the cure. But they were to stay for Arsidas , whom Phorbas promised to bring thither within three daies. Gelanorvs therfore seeing his Lord so eagerly bent, and giuing him charge to make all things ready for his departure, most readily obeyed him. The Masters of the Galleys called the men of warre and the Mariners to their seuerall offices; prouision was carried into the ships, and now each man was ready vpon the first warning for their voyage. Neither could were likely much to endanger him at Sea. What should be the reason of this haste, or what it might be, that had chanced to make him vndertake so dangerous a voyage, she could not imagine, and was afraid to bee too curiously inquisitiue. Hee, not able to take any rest through griefe of mind, sometimes fearing what would become of Argenis , and then boyling with rage against he with cheerefull words to hide his sicknesse, for feare he should be stayed by the generall voyce of all his people, from putting his life in such hazzard at Sea. It was not yet full two dayes since Phorbas departed, when Arsidas met with his extreme sicknesse, but much more with griefe and indignation, exceedingly changed. For, recouering his strength much sooner than the Phisicions expected, the next day after Phorbas had played his pranke with him, he aduentured to ride in a Horse-litter. After the first day, hee doubted not but to be able to ride on horse-backe, neither regarding himselfe, his toyle, nor the length of the way, for griefe of the losse of his letters. Whither might hee pursue the Thiefe? With what words should he excuse himselfe to Poliarchvs ? Or with what face should hee then returne to his Lady? In these pensiue thoughts he enters the Court, and was conducted to cheerefull countenance entertaining him; I will, said hee, bring the first newes my selfe to the King, of your arriuall. I will goe instantly, and comfort him with these glad tidings. But Arsidas about to excuse his mischance; Stay, Gelanorvs , said he, I would first acquaint you with the extremity of my misfortune. Gelanorvs supposing he meant of his captiuity, and his great ransome; We know all this, quoth hee; and besides, you will fitlier relate it anon to the King. And withall, he slips away from againe. Poliarchvs was astonied, and much praised Phorbas his diligence, that had so quickly freed Arsidas from the Pirates power: and calling for him, when hee would haue kneeled before him, this being the first time that euer hee had saluted him as a King, he would not suffer him. But now they were both of them long in an errour, til Poliarchvs began to speak of what Phorbas had told him touching the Pirates; and he, thinking sudden report had brought newes hither of the losse of the Letters. The gods, my good Arsidas , haue dealt graciously with vs, said the King, insomuch as after the storme, and the losse you haue sustained by Theeues, we yet haue you heere in safety. Your mischance, when I heard of it, was more griefe to me, than peraduenture to your selfe. And euen in that losse of mine, said take it. But pardon, I beseech you, your owne Arsidas : It is by my misfortune, not my treason, that you are wronged. Neither would I haue come in your sight, nor aduentured to haue made tryall of your heynous displeasure towards me, but that I knew, you would in your wisdome vnderstand, that no man hath his seruants hearts, nor the chances of Fortune in his owne power. But, replyed Poliarchvs , what occasion haue I, my Arsidas , to be angry with you? Because you exposed your selfe to the danger of the Sea for my sake? Because the storme and the Pirates haue almost vndone you? But where is our good Phorbas ? in the rewarding of whom, I take my selfe bound to giue testimony, how deare I hold you. Arsdias , beleeuing Poliarchvs had mocked him; Would to the gods, said hee, I had that Phorbas heere. He should cleere my innocence with his owne punishment. But how came you, great King, to know the name of Phorbas ? Because, saith hee, I cannot forget the man, that with such fidelity and care hath managed both your affaires and mine. Oh that you had seene him, Arsidas , when he was so eager, as not to brooke the least stay heere, lest it might endanger you. While hee takes breath, while the gold was telling, and at my request, he briefly reports your mischance, he was so perplexed with vnrest of mind, as in all his lookes, words, and gestures, he shewed his eagernesse and speede to poste towards you. But which way are the Pirates fled? Doe you thinke, if we should set out any ships in chase of them, we might yet meet with them? But what Pirates, or what honesty of Phorbas , replyed Arsidas , is this you tell me of? Whom if I, or if you, O gods? How readily should I, without putting it off to a further day, pay him what I owe him? I meane that Phorbas , said the King, by whom you, being then a prisoner, sent me these your Ladies Letters. What is the reason you will not know so true a friend? Arsidas , at the sight of these Letters, though not yet apt for mirth, with confusion of thoughts, often changed his colour; and for a good while had nothing else to say, but thus; Haue you the Letters then? and haue you them from Phorbas ? What wonders, what dreams be these, great Sir? Then againe taking breath; I could now almost forgiue him, said he, that hee would not altogether vndoe mee. But where is he? I haue not seene the man, replyed Poliarchvs , since he receiued of mee foure Talents, to carry for your ransome to the Pirates that kept you prisoner. Ah, said Arsidas , I was no mans prisoner. O crafty head! not inferiour to Avtolycvs ! Hath he then got both pay and praise for his treachery? And after he had robbed me, hath he also put a tricke vpon you? Then he told all in order, how hee had falne sicke at Ivba's house; and how, being robbed by Phorbas , hee came now to excuse himselfe, that Argenis her Letters had miscarried. story of his captiuity and danger, as Phorbas had deliuered it, whom yet I freely pardon, said he, for that he brought me this Letter for my foure Talents. But the weightie busines they had then in hand, suffered them not to dwell longer vpon Phorbas his treachery. When Poliarchvs therefore drawing he, the wretched Lady, whom I against my will doe make wretched, yet liues? What helpe, what counsell haue you for mee? What death bad enough shall I find out for Archombrotvs ? I had this day put to Sea from Africa ; but this last night my wounds grew worse and worse, so as I cannot indure the tossing of the Sea. In the meane time, till I recouer my strength, I will commit the strongest part of my forces to you and Gelanorvs . You shall take order for your Ladies affaites, in case Fortune haue beene hitherto so kind, as helpe comes not yet too late. I will make all speede after you, and either by death or victory, find satisfaction. Arsidas made him relation, as well of what Argenis had giuen him in charge at his comming from her, as of all other matters that had happened since Poliarchvs his departure. Chiefely he spake of the Pageant deuised by Radirobanes , so to carry away she proued false, and had inflicted punishment on her selfe. Then, Lady. The third man at this discourse was Gelanorvs : for Poliarchvs acquainted him with all the actions of his life, neuer keeping any thing from him.  the Queene.  especially shoot at the destruction of Archombrotvs, Micipsa comes from Sonne was come home with a Nauy, and vpon the shore: That vpon his first arriuall at the Court, he would lay aside all other busines, to visit ouer the whole Court. The people flocked, some to the Port, some to the Court- gate. The Nobles came to the Queene, and earnestly intreated her to send them to meete the Prince. For, Archombrotvs had in a light Pinnace sent word before him of his comming, and himselfe closely following the Messenger, was now vpon the shore. Some of his Ships cast Anchor in the Hauen on the right hand of the Riuer; others rowed vp the Riuer with wind and Oares against the streame; the Souldiers, that had thought they had come to a warre, often complaining, that they had none to make head against them. Archombrotvs himselfe, at his first setting foote on Land, prayed to his Countrey gods, and kissed the ground, where he drew his first breath: and then casting his eyes among the people, who with lowd showts  & claps welcomed him home, he answers the all with cheerefull countenance, yet so, as his Courtesie abated nothing of his Maiestie. Then turning to the Nobles, he admits them to kisse his hand, and acknowledges his old and familiar acquaintance: and with most courteous, but briefe language, as the time and the throng gaue him leaue, saluted all of them. He was often forced to stay long in one place, by reason of the prease of those that came to receiue him. Then, all the way as he went, he enquired of them that were next him, touching the Queene, the State of the Land, and the iniuries of Radirobanes . Hee had all told him, but briefly and confusedly from seuerall men, each man in their report disagreeing from other. But this he heard in generall; That Africa was free from danger; the French had giuen them succours; and Radirobanes was slaine. But Hyanisbe , all impatient that others should enioy the sight of her Son before her selfe, being both his Mother and his Queene, layed by her State, and came out of her Chamber, and vnder colour to obserue how gladly the people receiued him, and how braue Captaines and Souldiers hee had brought with him, came on to the Court-yard,  & from thence to the great Gate opening into the City. Archombrotvs seeing her a good way off, alights off his horse, carried with the exceedingnesse of gladnesse, runnes toward her, that met him halfe way. And as soone as he came to her,  & reuerently kissed the hem of her Robe, she weeping for ioy, could not forbeare before the people to shew her motherly affection, with such soft and tender expressions, as at other times she would haue reserued to more priuacy. Then wringing him by the hand, shee said; I commend your piety, Sonne, that you come so well appoynted to the defence of your Mother. But the King of France hath so wrought, that you may not thinke your selfe the onely man, to whom I owe a Mothers loue. By his meanes are wee all in safety: Hee hath freed your Mauritania from danger: He hath saued your Mother, who else had by this time beene a Slaue in Sardinia : and the Tyrant himselfe hath left his bloud in Africa , which hee vniustly inuaded. I speake not of another courtesie, for which wee are farre more indebted to him, then for our liberties; though neyther hee, nor any, but my selfe know so much. Come, Sonne, and offer not to sacrifice to your Countrey gods, before you haue visited him, that now languishes of those wounds, which for you preserued this Kingdome. Archombrotvs astonied at the greatnesse of so many fauours, found himselfe suddenly on fire with loue and gratitude to the French King: yet often excused himselfe for being more backward then forreine Princes in so extreme perill to his Mother and Countrey. And now some were sent before to tell Poliarchvs , that if it were no trouble to him, the Queene and her Sonne would come to see him. Hee replyes, if hee were not hindred with sicknesse, he would haue preuented them. And withall, hee sends two of his chiefest Nobles to meet them. Hee earnestly desired to see the Prince, whom by the Mauritanians report, and But they called him Hyempsal , indeed by his owne and most vsuall name: for hee had secretly taken vpon him the other name of Archombrotvs , to conceale his birth, when he trauelled first vnknowne, and in priuate habit to Sicily . The French Nobility stood about Poliarchvs with great reuerence. Arsidas was next him, and in talke with him. But when the Queene entred, leading Archombrotvs in her hand, shee was strucke to death almost with sudden horrour: for, as soone as Poliarchvs saw Archombrotvs , and hee againe knew him, (O Fate!) what storme, what thunder-bolt did euer shoot so quicke and deadly, as then their rage, disdaine, and desire of bloud changed both their mindes and their looks? They stood, as if they had seene Medvsa , without motion: and then with fierce and dreadfull eyes, though yet not altogether yeelding to their anger, they viewed one another from head to foot. They stood fretting, chafing, and musing: for, what a strange mockery was this of the gods? Two such bitter Enemies to be brought together, to loue and honour each other, that had much rather dye vpon one anothers Sword? Should Poliarchvs require backe his to auoyd him? And that little bloud he had left vn-shed for Hyanisbe's succour, should hee now, to her ruine, mingle it with the bloud of disdayne he had to owe himselfe, his Mother, and Countrey, to such an Enemy. Hee was ashamed at the meeting passions of hate, and piety: for, except he were the most vnthankefull man in the World, he could not vrge a mortall quarrell with Poliarchvs ; nor liue himselfe, if the other were happy. Their fury in both of them, by little and little increased: and nothing there was, but their respect to the Queene to stay them from violating all rights of Hospitality, and to preuent their slow weapons with their naked hands. Neyther was Arsidas lesse distempered at the sight of Archombrotvs ; and trembling said, Wee are all lost, Gelanorvs , vnlesse some god interpose himselfe, this day will not be ended without bloud and horrour. Was this then Hyanisbe's Sonne? and none know him? none hinder this accursed meeting? O happy Sicily , that shall not see those mischiefes shee is cause of! Sonne and her Guest, and not knowing what to suspect, thought fit to separate this ill-met couple, before their anger broke forth into irreconcileable fury; & after to search out the disease, and the remedy. First, she begins to disquieting you: Haue a care of your health, without which wee could not haue beene safe heretofore, and now we will not be. Wee will goe and pray to the gods, that this may proue a happy day for you and vs. Then, turning to her Sonne, whose eye was still fixed on Poliarchvs , shee bids him with a low voyce, goe out of the Chamber with her. Hee obeyed her command. Neyther did Queene went, to be fauourable to her. But Hyanisbe went not to the Temple: her minde was too much troubled, to haue the patience to offer Vowes or Prayers. But this vnexpected difference of the Princes, first filled the Court, and then the City, and the Souldiers with terrible amazement. Some fearefully asked, What the occasion of the grudge was? And some feigned causes of their owne heads. The Noble-men, that wayted on Poliarchvs , following the violence of their incensed King, though they knew not why Archombrotvs deserued to be an Enemy, begun to whisper amongst themselues, and talke of blowes, swords, and ruine. Through the whole Towne, factions grew betweene the late great friends, the French and Mauritanians , and then with the Sicilians that came with Archombrotvs . In such a great vprore, it was easier for most to disagree, then to resolue which part to take: for, saue the French , who all stood for their owne King, there were scarce any that stayed not long wauering: for, it would appeare a barbarous inhumanity in the Mauritanians to stand against Poliarchvs , whom they had a little before professed their sauer. Many also of the Sicilians exceedingly affected him: yet, notwithstanding their great fauour, commotions, not much inferiour to seditions, arose. Onely the Queene was diuided amidst so many broyles, sometimes labouring to disarme the multitude, and sometimes to appease her Sonne, and otherwhiles this effect: My Hyempsal , I had hope to haue triumphed at your returne, as it were betweene two Sonnes. But this vntimely fury hath incensed both of you to my ruine, and, vnlesse wee looke to it the better, to the destruction both of France and Mauritania . What meant those passions? With what an eye did you looke vpon Poliarchvs ? Wretched Woman that I am! what mischiefe was I like to haue seene? But I question not the cause of this quarrell: nor which of you hath greatest occasion of grudge. At this time I onely intreat you, by your Countrey gods; and if you respect not them, because whom you worshipped at your departure from that Iland, and by your loued speake. I desire you not now, Sonne, to lay aside your anger, but deferre it for a time: I will looke to your reconciliation hereafter. If you deny mee this, consider yet at least, by what meanes you may bury the remembrance of the benefits we stand ingaged for.  Queens intreaty. Timonides acquainteth the Queen with the subiect of this quarrell. The ioy shee receyued, knowing, it lay in her hands to reconcile them: and how shee proceeded.  feare; when it was told her, that Poliarchvs was preparing for his departure from the Court: for, after hee was thus inraged with the sight of his Corriuall, hee begun to loathe that House, and was not free from suspicion, it might be dangerous to stay in the power of his Enemy, or to trust him or his Mother. Being himselfe in this doubt, hee was the easlier perswaded to goe away by the counsell of his Nobles, that pressed all occasions of feare, and would seeme to shew their loue in their care of him. He therefore giues present charge to his Commanders, to place some of his troupes at the Court-gate, for his guard at his departure: and to draw the rest presently out of the Towne: and then to choose some fit place to pitch his Tents in, not farre from his Ships; where hee would lodge amongst his owne people: yet, that he might not offend with too much haste, nor wrong the Queene, that had not yet deserued it, hee sends his high Chamberlaine to her with this Message; That hee gaue her thankes for his noble intertainement, and for her care and respect of him, when hee lay sicke of his wounds: That he would not trouble her at this time with leaue, being busied in the entertainement of her Sonne: That hee must of force leaue the Court, vpon some vrgent occasions: but before hee put to Sea, hee desired (if shee so pleased) to take his leaue of her, and giue her his thankes himselfe for her many fauours shewed him. deseruing Guest, one whom besides shee dearely respected for his vertues, was leauing her Court; and leauing it (O misery!) eyther as an Enemy, or as going from his Enemies. What shall she doe? whom shall she first speake to? Whether of these angry Foes, could shee (if need were) first leaue to loue? But yet shee had reason to hope to preuayle with her Sonne, sooner then the other, both in respect of her owne authority, and his duety. Turning therefore to him; Will you promise mee, my Sonne, (quoth shee) to keepe your selfe quiet till my returne? Promise mee; by all a Mothers right I begge it. If you deny mee, you ought as well deny any claime in my Inheritance. When he had promised, she hastes to Poliarchvs , that was now gone out of his Lodging, and already taking horse: for, though hee were very weake, yet would hee not be carryed in a Horse-litter, that hee might not giue Archombrotvs the meanes to report, he had deferred the combate, vnder colour of sicknesse. to shew, she also held him by the cloake: And, I beseech you, Sir, said she, euen by your infinite goodnesse shewed vnto vs, that before you proceed to shame my truth to you by your departure, you will giue mee leaue to speake a few words to you in priuate. and came backe with her into a Closet of the Chamber, where, when they were priuate, the Queene with teares saith: The gods are my witnesses, that I did not treacherously, nor with ill intent bring him into your presence, for whose sake you now abandon mee. Would you had neuer knowne him; would he had stayed away, since hee does mee more mischiefe peraduenture by his comming, then euer King) I would haue made him as humble to you, as now you see my selfe am. With these words, forgetting all Maiestie, shee cast her selfe at his feet, though much against his will, and sadly shaking her head, with abundance of sighs, was not able to speake a word. vp from the ground, complayning, that she had done him no lesse iniury by such an abiect humiliation, then that was, wherein her Sonne had wronged him. Then saith the Queene, What then is the iniury wherewith he hath so heynously prouoked you; or in what Land did the Destinies first sow these seeds of sedition betweene you? May I know this from you, my dearest Guest? for hee refuses to tell mee. And will you too vtterly vndoe me with obstinate silence; and I neuer know, with which of his bolts Ivpiter strikes mee? Doe not depart, doe not, I beseech you, from my house, till it shall appeare, that this mischiefe be without remedy. Many things are asswaged in time; and the grudges which wee smother in silence, are after discouery often appeased. But if it be not fit for you and him to stay both in one house, hee shall depart. Doe you feare to trust mee with your life? Fill the Court with a guard of French . It shall not be lawfull for any armed men, besides your people, to be seene here: for, if you persist, and leaue mee heere a miserable Woman, assuredly I will turne my Sonne out also. Why should you lye in your Ships or your Tents, while hee enioyes the ease and liberty of the Court, being with your danger bought him? Would you then haue a combate betweene you? Why, you cannot now presume vpon strength of body, which is spent for my sake; but onely vpon anger and courage; the Fates perhaps so disposing; who if they shall bring eyther of you to miscarry, I will instantly follow him that dyes; and, after my death, with reuengefull furies torment the Suruiuor. Here shee fell afresh to weeping, and familiarly plucked his Riding-cloake from his shoulder. Then cunningly seeming to take a short pawse of his, for consent, shee giues him thankes for the fauour shee had not yet receyued. So, this vehement and obstinate suit of hers, mingled with teares, conquered now you so highly are offended with. You know, it is not alwaies in the power of Enemies to gouerne their anger, chiefly when their rage is incensed with one anothers presence. I therefore thought good to leaue your Court, lest eyther I, or your Sonne, might doe something to your griefed but, if you thinke it so expedient, I will be content to stay here yet these two dayes, that so I may rather appeare to be drawne away by my businesse, then by any malice betweene him and mee; yet vpon this condition, that in the meane time he may neyther see mee, nor I him. But I would not haue you thinke (excellent Queene) that the honour and respect I haue hitherto borne to your selfe, is any thing abated by this difference: for, neyther shall you euer be able to make me loue him; nor hee bring mee to dis-respect you. Yes, replyed both your mindes, and free you both from this malignity of chance, that thus hath blinded you with fury. With this, shee calleth in some of the French Nobility, that were neerest them, and smiling; I haue (said shee) greater care of your King, then all you, my Lords. None of you, in his sicknesse, and his wounds not yet cured, would stay him from indangering himselfe in a long and weary voyage: but I haue preuayled with him, not to cast away himselfe so. Presently there is a countermand sent to the Souldiers, and the Citie, ere- while so diuided with vncertaine rumours, begun now to be quieted, after this ioyfull newes: for, as Fame alwayes makes things greater than they are; so now it was rumoured, that the two Princes were reconciled, and their anger ended in a strong League of friendship. So, the French and Mauritanians , that had beene at oddes against their wils, were soone agreed: and Hyanisbe remembring her promise, made Proclamation, that none should enter the Court with weapons, saue onely the French . The first brunt of this mischiefe thus auoyded; the Queene applyes her selfe to other and likelier remedies. But neyther could shee finde such, not make vse of them, as long as shee knew not the cause of the quarrell. As shee was thinking how to learne the certainty, a fit occasion offered it selfe, honour of his King, stayed in the Ships, till Archombrotvs was come to the Towne, with purpose to come to the Queene, attended onely with his owne Trayne, and second to none. But it was quickly told him of this stirre: for, some of the Sicilians that went with Archombrotvs , made haste backe to bring him newes, that Poliarchvs , whom they had long seene in Sicily , was the King of France ; that he lay sicke and hurt at Hyanibe's Court; and at sight of Archombrotvs , they both fell into a bitter quarrell. And they added, that Arsidas was with Poliarchvs . All this was strange to sent to him by Meleander , with the Bracelet that Eristhenes had poysoned. He was therefore exceeding glad to heare hee was there, and that hee was a King. But how Arsidas came thither, he much wondered,  & not without cause. He could more easily guesse at Archombrotvs his anger; that it proceeded fro the loue of Argenis : for, the report of that secret, had by little and little spred ouer all Sicily ; so as no man now doubted, wherein thinke of his owne businesse, he bethought him to which side he should chiefly adhere: for, if vnder colour of his place he should stand indifferent, he should goe displeasure on all hands, and not scape his reuenge, whosoeuer got the best, for all his cunning. His former friendship, and Argenis her affection to him, drew him no Poliarchvs : but the remembrance of to violate, called him backe to Archombrotvs his side. Being yet vnresolued, hee sends before to the Queene to giue notice of his comming: for hee ought at least with all speed truely informe himselfe of all things, and send exact relation thereof to Meleander . The Queene still continuing in her doubts, suddenly conceiued a hope, that by meanes of this Ambassadour, shee might come to know the cause of this dangerous difference. So, giuing him present audience, after some complementall questions, such as shee thought fit, touching Meleander ; shee fell to bewayle the grudge betweene their quarrell, and therefore no meanes to reconcile them. being no great secret, nor a thing to be ashamed of. In few words therefore her shewes her, how Poliarchvs had liued long in Sicily vnder the habit of a priuate man and falling in loue with Argenis , had hope to haue had her in marriage, which now was promised to Archombrotvs . It was no maruell then, if two such Riuals, ayming at so high a fortune, should bitterly fall out, on so great an occasion. At these words, Hyanisbe re-comforted her selfe, insomuch as shee could hardly conceale her ioy before Timonides . And when he made a doubt, whether he might, without offence to him to goe: for, she would assure him, her Sonne should well like of it. As soon as Timonides was gone, the Queen begun to consider, after what manner she should handle this great businesse; assuring her selfe, that vpon her depended the fortune and issue of so great a controuersie, she re- collected her Princely courage, and durst euen despise fortune. She also called to mind, how, when Poliarchvs was by her requested to giue Africa succour against the Sardinians , his countenance changed, and he asked, whether Argenis were marryed to Radirobanes . From hence she imagined, that Poliarchvs was in loue, and Timonides had told truth. Thus therefore shee resolued with her selfe, that if the young men were tractable, shee would send them into Sicily , putting off the remedy of their disease till they were there; the rather, for that the chiefe meanes of their cure was in Meleander's consent. But if their variance could not continue without mischiefe, shee would presently take away all occasion of falling foule each with other for that time. So she comes to her Sonne, now somewhat more imperiously then before; and, as if she had learned the cause of their difference from Poliarchvs ; I like not, quoth shee, this silence of yours; especially, since what you keepe so close, is neyther shamefull, nor vnworthy your selfe; and I could know the very same from your Riuall: Yee both loue Argenis . A great corrosiue, I grant, to young men, and a mightie cause of anger. She is a Lady, as I heare, vpon whom there is none of the gods, but hath bestowed some endowment. Sicily is her inheritance. And (which is the greatest matter in high spirits) neyther of you can finde in your hearts to goe backe from this strife. I will bring this businesse so to passe betweene you, (which, you thinke, none of the gods can doe) that you shall both of you lay aside all hatred, both of you loue Argenis , and shee loue you both. You know, my Sonne, I put off your marriage with Argenis , which you were so neere vnto, till you had returned to mee. You obeyed my command. You shall vnderstand, I gaue you not that charge for nothing. But there are certaine things I would question you about, if I may hope from a young Louer, and a Corriuall with another, to heare the truth. What hinderance is Poliarchvs to your wish? for, you sent me word, that, if I had then consented, you had had no stop to the present dispatch of the marriage. Tell mee, good Sonne; for, it concernes your selfe that I should know this. confesse, that Argenis loued Poliarchvs . So, he answers her, that corriualship, who had laboured, as much as in him lay, to fill the harmelesse young Ladies minde with idle and friuolous tales. Here the Queene cunningly replyes; Yea, but what if by these meanes hee should alienate the Ladies heart from you? Would he not hinder your marriage so? At this, Archombrotvs in a greater chafe then before; By the gods, said he, she should be forced by her Father, that is no lesse earnest to haue the marriage goe forward then my selfe. Then hee relates to her, Poliarchvs his banishment out of Sicily , the warre against Lycogenes , and his owne victory. But although in the whole discourse he fauoured himselfe, yet with Meleander , but Poliarchvs with Argenis . She was now much merrier with her Sonne at Supper then before: for, she thought, she had discouered enough for that night. The next day, she returnes to Poliarchvs , hauing prepared her selfe, not with words onely, but hauing by delay, aduising with her selfe al the last night digested the whole course of carrying the businesse. When shee had familiarly saluted him, and willed such as were there, to withdraw themselues; I wondred, quoth shee, my deare Guest, why your selfe and my Sonne should be at variance: But I heare, it is the power of a worthy and excusable loue in you both, and that onely vpon mee to giue both of you helpe. I am she alone, that can cure both your diseases. What need all these complaints and brawles in so easie a matter? The businesse yet stands well; the alliance vnperfected; Argenis vnmarried. I will make you a glad man; I will make you conquerour without danger of fight. I will make friendship (why doe you abhorre, and refuse this?) betweene you and my Sonne. Neyther wonder that I make so large a promise: Take this hand vpon it, that I haue spoken nothing, but what I will performe. and now almost thinking himselfe to be abused, intreats the Queene to breake off her obscure speech, and not to speake of Argenis at all. But, said shee, I will yet more astonish you, my dearest Guest, with a greater wonder: for I will haue you indebted to mee for Argenis , and yet not take her from my Sonne. But Fate will haue it so, that ye cannot be presently cured with a sudden and open remedy: you must go both together into Sicily , and deliuer the Letters, which I shall send by you, to Meleander . Your grudges will be instantly ended, and both of you cease to complayne of loue. her houshold gods, and the Vessell wherein they put fire before the Altar, to be brought in: which being set vpon the Table, with Coales in it, and couered the little gods with a Cloud of Perfumes, the Queene bound her selfe with these imprecations; Heare mee, yee Genij that are present, and you greater gods alwayes vigilant to our safety; and you that were borne amongst vs, and preserue this House, and this Countrey; If I haue spoken any thing false to King Poliarchvs ; or if I doe not by my meanes bring him assured safety, rest, and ioy; then vtterly bereaue this house of your care and guard of it; or, leauing the house vntouched, bring mischiefe and destruction vpon Mee, and my Sonne. Queene, that hee could call the same gods whom she had inuoked, to witnesse his innocence: for, before Archombrotvs euer set foot in Sicily , settled, he with his vnseasonable desires had laboured to disturbe them: and because the young Lady scorned to be changed, had sollicited her Father to rigorous courses; so that her hard-hearted Father would now condemne the free and Princely Maid, to the slauery of an inforced marriage. As he was with these and the like speeches re-enforcing his anger, which with this little, though short time of peace, was something asswaged; the Queene stopped him; for, shee was not come, shee said, to adde new fewell to the fire of his wrath; but that she might with them both enioy the reconciliation, which she did assuredly bring them. But what a small fauour is it, my most louing Guest, that I begge of you? onely this, that you proceed not to mortall quarrell with my Sonne, vntill such time as you haue seene Meleander haue read the Letter which I will write vnto him. Promise mee, great King, onely this abstinence from words and weapons for so long. I here vndertake as much my selfe, and assure you, for my sonnes patience, and faire dealing towards you. After that time, you may both of you, by my good leaue, take your owne course by fire and sword. sets vpon her sonne with the like promises; and hee also thought his Mother doted. But when shee still perseuered in these requests and promises, it was hard for him with obstinate refusall to deny her. And both of them thought, her request was not too great: for, it would be worth their stay, if by her Letters to Meleander , the difference might be ended without warre or bloud-shed: But if her promises came to nothing, they had both such full leaue from her to fight, that she could not be offended with him, that conquered with the death of the other. With both their consents therefore she sets downe these conditions betweene them; That neither of them should rip vp old iniuries, nor allow their Souldiers to stirre vp any strife or tumult, before they had both together seene Meleander : They should goe for Sicily , as soone as Poliarchvs his wounds would giue him leaue to trauell by Sea; and that neyther of them should goe about by fraud or vnder-hand to infringe these conditions. These things thus agreed vpon, the hardest matter was for Hyanisbe to preuaile with the two young Princes to haue conference together; Which, said shee, I chiefely vrge, to take away all occasion of brawle or difference betweene the Subiects and the Souldiers, which may perhaps against both your wills by little and little grow vp, vnlesse you seeme to confirme this temporary peace by some publike pledge of it. Why doe you sticke then to see one another, betweene whom I am assured there will be so firme a bond of friendship, that if the Fates shall deceiue mee in my hope and wish, I will not refuse but to receiue vengeance my selfe from the hatred that is now betweene you, for the vanity of my promises. And not content to assay that were gracious with Archombrotvs . Hauing wonne them to talke together, there rose a vaine and scrupulous question, what they should say, or who should beginne. And before Hyanisbe (for, shee brought her Sonne to Neither could they endure to meete oftner, than the Genius of their friendship, first begun in Timoclea's house, sought now againe to insinuate it selfe into their angry brests; and both of them were displeased with the Fates, that had laid such a necessity of variance vpon them. But then againe, the daily remembrance of Argenis , and the shame of each of them to be first to desire a reconciliation, plucked them euer backe from their milder thoughts.  Arsidas returnes into Sicily . The troubles in Sardinia . The Designe of  wounds, hauing beene (amongst other, that were more dangerous) neglected, was so inflamed, and so pained him, that it brought his weake body into a Feauer. Neither did it trouble him more than Archombrotvs , to haue his voyage stayed. For, it was in their agreement, that neither of them should goe into Sicily before the other. Impatient therefore of delay, and desiring to write at least; that their Letters might not bee intercepted, they resolue to send some of approued trust. Archombrotvs wrote to Meleander and himselfe for his slow returne, partly, by his Mothers command, partly, that he might not seem, through base feare, to take aduantage of the time in his enemies sicknesse, the better to worke out his chiefe businesse. He chose one Father of Argenis . His greatest doubt was, whether Arsidas should goe backe with his Letters into Sicily . He feared the Kings suspition, and some secret and crosse danger, by reason of the great fauour Archombrotvs was in. But if he should returne, the storme would hitherto excuse this his meeting with Poliarchvs : but if he stayed with him, his stolne message might bee found out. He therefore resolues to send him. And to him also, beene of one faction, commits his Letters sent to the King and Cleobvlvs ; wherein he so remembred the publike businesse, as he forgot not his owne. In the meane time newes came from Sardinia , that all things were there in broyle with Ciuill warres; Harsicoras and Cornivs , two of so ambitiously affect. This gaue hope to Archombrotvs , that that Nation, now deuided into factions, and yet fearing the power of Africa , might, if it had a speedy Enemy, be easily conquered. Therefore, that the forces of Sicily , which he had brought with him, might not be without action; and that hee might not shew himselfe to his Mauritanians inferiour to sickns hindred his voyage into Sicily ) he thither transported the Army hee brought with him, ioyning with them some other forces of the Mauritanians : yet promising his Mother and Poliarchvs , that whether he were Conqueror, or the gods crossed his attempt, he would not willingly be absent aboue one moneth out of Africa . Departing vpon these conditions, he had the present fauour of the gods almost beyond his own wish. For, the victory did so readily offer it selfe to him, that (besides his calling of Councels of war, and inuasion, and the tryall of one battell) Fortune left him no meanes to try his valour. First, entring the empty Hauens, and there leauing Guards, he landed his Souldiers, and ascended a Mountaine top, from whence he might view Sardinia , an vnwholsome Countrey, but fruitfull in corne, and well approued the names, which the Ancients had giuen it, from the shape of a Pantofle or foot, calling it Sandaliotis or Ichnusa . The Sardinians had already met, with their powers, in two battels fought betweene themselues for the Kingdome, and those bloody fights had wasted the strongest of their Nobles and Souldiers. So, miserable men, spoyling the Countrey, they fought indeed for Scowts to bring them word, of whar Countrey, and what number their enemies were. For, not farre off in the Plaine, the two Kinsmen had pitched their Tents. And when they heard, the Mauritanians and Sicilians were come, and that they had with a strong Fleet possessed the Sea, they neuer considered what was best to bee done for the publike safety; which was, to lay aside ciuill discension, and to ioyne all against the forraigne Enemy, that yet knew not the Countrey. And the one of them, Harsicora , that had been much weakened in the last battell, and despairing of victory, that at least he might hinder his Competitour from enioying the Kingdome, yeelded himselfe and his forces to Archombrotvs . So little esteeme is had of mens Countries and priuate Families, in regard of ciuill hatred and malice, that they had often rather ruine their Countrie, and put themselues vnder a forraigne Yoke, then giue place to any of their owne Countreymen; as if the basenesse of obedience were more, if you submit to those you know; and were eased with the strangenesse of your Lords. But Cornivs , of a more noble spirit, put all vpon an honourable tryall, and led his Souldiers to the Field; where aduancing himselfe against his Competitour, that had reuolted to Archombrotvs , he slew him. But he ouer-liued him not, being ouer-charged with the number of the Mauritanians ; who with a lamentable end of ambition, mingled the bloods of the two Cousins. Besides, the extraordinary valour of Archombrotvs , shewed in this battell, much quelled the Sardinians ; who at length being either slaine or put to flight, he made vse of his fortune, and brings his Army before the chiefe Townes and Castles. He had not many Skirmishes with this conquered people; his greatest labour was at Calaris , where the people made a disordered Salley, but being driuen backe within the walls, the next day their mindes changing, they sent to treate of yeelding. Vertiganes a little before dyed, not vnhappily, in that hee liued not to see these miseries. Some few, not brooking to bee subiect to strange Lords, fled to the Cunicularian Ilands, in the narrow Sea, that diuides Corsica from Sardinia . From thence they passed ouer to Corsica , which also suffered the like conquest, and they lurked in the Mountaines of Liguria . But there was a common rumour amongst the Sardinians , that this warre and destruction hapned by the angry hand of the gods, because Radirobanes prophanely violated the religion of a Temple which they held most sacred, about tenne miles from Calaris , dedicated to Ivpiter . There were many gifts at the Altar, that had beene offered to the god, both of gold and siluer: and their ancient Kings had hallowed there the god's owne Image, of massie gold. All which, Radirobanes , at his voyage into Africa , taking away, vnder a vaine pretence of borrowing toward the charge of his warre, did also vse the Priests themselues churlishly, that resisted him; which many at that time tooke for an ill presage, and was afterwards confirmed by the miserable calamity that befell the Sardinians . For, they held nothing more holy than that Temple, and the reuerend Priests were honoured by the people, as present gods. This report of Radirobanes his Sacriledge, and the sanctity of the Temple, being bruited abroad by many, came to Archombrotvs his eare, who, whether moued with piety towards the heauenly powers, or desiring to winne the Sardinians affections by his forward worshipping the gods of that Countrey, visiteth the Temple. The very situation and holy admiration of the place affected him suddenly with a deuout feare. There were craggy Rockes at the foot of the Hill, thorow which a little path was cut. When these are passed, the pleasing young Groues yeeld much delight with their deepe silence, and vntrimmed simplicity. Presently a huge Porch was to be seene; so made to receiue the light from aboue, as yet it was not altogether free from darknesse. As Archombrotvs entred, he might see these Verses; which the Priests had in such manner offered to the eye of those that entred, hung vp in a woodden Table, as could scarce scape the obseruing.  Heere no guilt roofes, nor riotous Banquets bee; No costly sleepe on beds of Iuorie; No Couerlets, that Triton Purple dyes; No ecchoing Roomes; nor Pearle-embroderies; No bending Seruants; no things else, that are To couetous Nations causes of a warre. Their Groues, bare walles, and walkes no cost does keepe; Hard is their fare; short their appointed sleepe; Labour their gaines; and course their cloathings be; And by long death their liues they mortifie. But neither Furies, nor distracting care Rage heere; nor does dissembled malice teare The Owners heart-strings; but with peacefull rest And concord are these litle houses blest. Heere innocent smiles are from true hearts exprest: Her selfe, and all the gods, the happy Mind Enioyes, and backe to Heauen the way confind.  conquered in Hyanisbe's right. The returne of Archombrotvs into Mauritania .  were two poore Altars, with woodden Images on them; the one of Wisdome , which held a Serpent in her hand, with the taile writhen about it, as scorning the power of her Charmes; the other of Fortitude , with both her hands bearing vp a great Pillar. Then two of the Priests of the Temple, hearing of questions about those Altars, they told him, the Images of Fortitude and Wisdome were there placed, to the end, that such as would be receiued into their Family, might vnderstand, that no rash inconsiderate attempts please the gods; but minds so exactly indued with strong wisedome, as that they neither rashly take vp, nor giue ouer their resolution: but the Images were made of wood, that the humility of these most excellent gods might signifie pouerty, which they willingly embrace. Archombrotvs earnestly beholding them, because their meane attire did not degenerate from so graue Philosophie; he obserued also their leane cheeks, and their eyes, accustomed, as it were, to looke towards heauen, not well to endure the sight of Princely Maiestie. Now therefore more religiously reuerencing them, after they had passed the Porch, he asked, what god or man had prescribed them this life. The desire of happinesse, said one of them, smiling, which you also pursue, but in a different manner. You, by seeking wealth; we, by refusing it, make tryall, which be the securest riches: and both of vs tyre our bodies and minds with much toyle; you indeed, that you may come to the height of all humane estate; wee, that we may haue no such desire. So, the gods haue giuen vs humility, you cares, both of vs labour. This free speech of the milde Priest so pleased Archombrotvs , that he begun more heartily to affect the Genius of the house. In the meane time the other Priests came together, by whom he is led into the Temple, and placed to offer vp his vowes, not far from the Altar of Celestiall Ivpiter , which Altar alone it was lawfull for those Priests to garnish with gold and silke. But Radirobanes had also carried away those Ornaments; which when that the iniury next to Sacriledge, which this Altar hath receiued, shall no longer bee an eye-sore to you, nor offend the mighty Ivpiter : I will set vp a Statue of massie gold, of greater waight than before. All other things requisite to the seruice of the god, I will in like abundance cause to bee allowed you. The gods, replyed the Priests, will thanke you. For the Priests themselues, they were nothing moued with gold nor wealth; saue onely, that the common people admiring the riches of the Altar, might conceiue worthily of the power and maiestie of the gods. In all other things, their chiefe desire was, to enioy the safety of their contentfull pouerty within the walls of the Cloyster. They knew also, that oftentimes the couetous minds of wicked men were enticed by such great wealth as might be robbed out of Temples. Neither had Radirobanes this way offended, but that the improuident liberality of his Predecessors towards the gods, had, as it were, laid a bait for his greedy desire. It were better to adorne the Temples with such things, as either cannot be remoued out of their place, or are not worth the taking away, then with massie gold or Treasure, which, with its great value, inuites many to the boldnesse of so rich Sacriledge. From hence they led him where he first saw their Gardens, then their Cells, and then, their homely Dining-roome. Their houshold-stuffe was meane, and their beds hard; yet all so neat and cleane, as you might there perceiue, that great spirits despise superfluity, and yet neglect not decency and handsomnes. delectable sight of their most strict religion, willed one of them, an old man, of great reuerence, to discourse vnto him the order of that kinde of life, their Lawes, and state of their profession. But, faith hee, what benefit wee haue by forsaking those things which other men haue in most esteeme, I will, mighty King, spare to speake: for you seeme rather to aske, what we doe here in this solitary abode, than why we came hither: and besides, the benefit of this strict course of life cannot bee expressed by any humane tongue. Onely the gods are they, who by their secret word doe commend to whom they please, this new and strange happinesse, that is concealed from the eyes and sences of others. Yet will I say thus much, That the end of our studies is, to deserue those things, which the gods bestowe vpon those whom they loue. And to this end, we thinke it best to maintaine a daily combate against vices, and immoderate desires. And therefore, with as much earnestnesse as others seeke after rule and power, we fly from pride, and study obedience. Wee make one amongst vs our yeerely Gouernour, without either troublesome or ambitious voyces. Hee thinkes that office a heauy burden, that withdrawes him from his peacefull contemplations; and takes on him this poore gouernment, onely in hope at the yeeres end to returne into his happy course of obedience. But we obey with such reuerence, that you would imagin, he had diued into our secret thoughts, and commanded vs onely that, which we most desired. Yet our chiefe care is, (as we are men) if he should command too imperiously; or we, either through sloth or obstinacy, goe from our duty, that this difference bee not diuulged abroad. There would quickly be an end of the peace wee seeke, if we should appeale to other Iudges or Vmpires than our selues. Next to this institution of obedience, we are most carefull, that we truely loue our fellows and equals. We excuse and forbeare one another, if it chance there be any different dispositions or affections: and we are angry with our selues, when we finde our selues vnable to commend or endure any thing in our Brother. Our apparell, as you see, is meane, our diet slender, and our times of rest interrupted with often and limited watchings. So can wee gouerne our tamed bodies; nor doe we feare (which is most mens chiefest care) the changes of dangerous Honour, or the transitory and mutable face of pleasures, whose benefit wee are voluntarily ignorant of. But though we are contented with a little, yet we seeke out meanes to tyre our selues with labour, hauing found the mischiefe of idlenesse, wherewith mens strength, which was not giuen them in vaine, is weakened, and an inclination bred to vices. Therefore, whatsoeuer time we can spare from the seruice of the god, each of vs spends in his seuerall office. Such as excell others in wit, and the gifts of the mind, are appointed to the study and contemplation of more high and heauenly things, which afterwards they offer to the view of others, bringing this spring from a higher leuell to the vse of mortall men. The rest follow some Art, which they are most prone vnto by nature, that we may both suffice our selues, and helpe others. Neither haue I made you this discourse, to extoll, but to excuse our selues; lest the strangenesse of our life should offend you. For, I know there be some, that with too generall sentence condemne all new things, as if the ground of it were to gaine an easie kind of life; and that it is but few yeeres, since we assaied to vphold our slackned deuotion towards the gods, with this strict course of life. By this time, had this long speech, and his youthfull impatience, drawne him more at large, he wils the same Priest come to him the next day to Calaris . Then he turned himselfe to some merrier discourse amongst his owne people, who depended vpon his countenance, whether they had better approue or disallow of these new inuenters of so strict an order. But when the night gaue him leisure to consider of the publike businesse, he thought it a matter of great moment, that the people should bee instructed by these examples, and bee brought to the worship of the gods. And therefore, when those Priests came to him the next morning, as he had commanded, hee willed them to choose foure out of their society, whom hee would carry with him, to instruct Africa in these mysteries. Presently hee had two of the elder, and two of the younger sort appointed for him. And, lest the Africans , in contempt or hatred of the Sardinians , late their enemies, should scornefully receiue their discipline, they chose out all Strangers; two Ligurians , and two French: for, many from diuers Nations, had put themselues into that Society. All things being now in readinesse for his returne, Archombrotvs , when hee had placed Garrisons in the most conuenient places, makes Proclamation by a Herald in a full Assembly, that hee had conquered Sardinia , in his Mother Hyanisbe's right: That the gods had so appointed, that the difference betweene their Kings should no longer afflict both Nations: and that the Fates had at length restored Sardinia to His kindred, whose indeed it was in right of his Ancestors. Then taking the Nobles of Sardinia with him; those especially that were of the Royallblood, the wind serued him so well, that within thirty dayes after his departure from Mauritania , hee placed his new-conquered Crowne vpon his Mothers head. But Poliarchvs was exceedingly glad at this hap of Sardinia , though hee grieued it was wonne by Archombrotvs , not yet knowing how much benefit this victory would be to himselfe. If so fell out, that amongst the French Souldiers, who had put themselues among the people, to behold Archombrotvs his returne, one of them more narrowly obserued the vnusuall habit, which those graue Priests brought from the Temple in Sardinia . Hee therefore drew neerer, and merrily iested in the French Tongue with one of his fellowes, at that kind of apparell. The Priests presently turned about, hearing their Countrey language, being indeed French-men themselues, who were so iested vpon; and wondred at this, that they should meete with men in so remote a part of the world, that could speake French . One of them especially, a man of great yeeres, when hee had discouered his face, (for his Hood couered all his head) and sometimes obserued the Souldier that scoffed at him, he quickly gaue suspition to the French that stood about him, that he was their Countrey-man or neere neighbour: for, both his complexion, and the quicke motion of his eye, shewed him to be so: neither did the simplicity of his religious Order altogether darken his naturall Countrey habit, which well appeared by his comely demeanour and carriage of his body. And this, the Souldier that came to scoffe at him, curiously obserued aboue the rest; for, he called to mind the face and presence of that man, as hauing formerly knowne him. Following him therefore into the Towne, that he might put himselfe out of doubt, as he was entring his lodging, he saluted him in French : and the other, not refusing to exchange courtesie and language with him, saluted him also in the same Tongue. So, then they parted. But the Souldier could take no rest all that night, sometimes blaming himselfe for his superfluous curiosity, and wondring how it should concerne him to know this Priest. At the breake of day, he goes backe to the house where the Priests lodged, and desired to speak with them. But now had they, vnder colour of hauing a solitary place for their deuotions, obtained leaue to retire into a Chappell fast by, seated out of the common way, in a Groue; but in truth, to auoyd the company of the French , whom they had vnawares met withall in Africa . Euen this absence of theirs more inflamed the Souldier; and in great haste he ouertakes them, before they came to the Temple; and after hee had saluted them, as if he went that way about other businesse; I am, said he, much indebted to Fortune, you Priests of the great god Ivpiter , in that, as I was going to the next Forrest, she hath giuen me this happy lucke to meete with you; and shall thinke my selfe more indebted to her, if, as I thinke  & hope, you be my Countrey-men. It repented the ancient Priest, that he had the day before so vnaduisedly made himselfe knowne, by speaking his naturall language. But fearing to breed suspition of a greater matter by denying his countrey, and so stir vp the Souldier's curiosity to farther questions that might yet perhaps be satisfied with some short discourse, that he indeed was a French-man , but hee had liued out of his Countrey euer since his youth.  King Aneroestvs knowne by a French Souldier. Poliarchvs reioyceth to finde him, and beareth a relation of his Aduentures. How he was retired from the world.  Souldier earnestly eying his face, as he was speaking, stood amazed at those lookes hee had formerly knowne, and vpon which he had often with due reuerence depended. Besides, the fashion of his countenance enforced the Souldier to beleeue what he wished. But when the wel-knowne scarre in his left hand appeared, (for, that he might discouer it, he tooke him by the same hand, as in courtesie, much against his will) then fetching a deepe sigh, he cryes alowd; Where haue you lyen hid so long,  o best of Kings? Wee did not all of vs, your Subiects, offend; whom, alas, you haue forsaken. But what attire is this? What meanes this lonelinesse from your friends? How much is all this below your estate? And withall, holding him, against his will, fast by the knees, he wept exceedingly. The Priest, crying out, that the Souldier was mad, and often changing his countenance betweene smiling and indignatio, turnes scornfully from him to his Companions. But they themselues were troubled with the Souldiers speeches, still perseuering in his affirmation, that this was his King, this was Aneroestvs ; that he would not depart from his side, but would make vse of the fauour of the gods, that (after so many yeers search in vaine) had at last restored him. The old man, betweene chiding and a faigned amazement drawes softly towards him, and whispers him in the eare: Oh Souldier, quoth he, if in length of time, either thy memory or thy eyes faile thee; or if thou mistakest mee for some other that is like me; it were more modesty in thee, not to make such an open iest of me. But if I bee thy King, I first challenge this duty of a Subiect from thee, to be silent; and if thou hast such a mind, follow me, till wee may talke priuately. This Caution came too late: for, though the Souldier obeyed him, yet some others, both French and Africans , that were in the company, who wondred at the strangenesse of the chance, and itching to be the first reporters of so admirable newes among the people, made haste into the Citie. There were two bands in Poliarchvs his Campe, of that Nation about the Alpes , where heare of the newes, betweene rashnesse and amazement, fill first the Campe, and then the Citie with the same rumour. was appoynting a certaine day to begin the voyage to Sicily . As he was busied in this consultation, Gelanorvs , with a countenance betweene hope and doubt, comes to him; I heare (said hee) I know not what newes of King booty, though in apparell ill-beseeming his Princely state, yet knowne by a Souldier his Country-man. with the exceedingnesse of hope, answered, That if the newes were true, he would honour them as his Parents, that had restored Aneroestvs ; a gift dearer than his owne life: and that hee should owe to them that had conquered Sardinia , not onely what his friends, but almost as much as the gods could deserue. The Queene greedily hearkened to these words, esteeming it the greatest fauour of the gods, that might be, if Archombrotvs , that was so many waies bound to Poliarchvs , had likewise by good fortune done any thing that might pleasure him againe. Wherefore, with a more chearefull countenance, and vsing spurres, as it were, to him that was forward enough to reioyce, shee askes, what had happened; or what this man was, that was worthy to bee sought, or found, with so many vowes and wishes. was taken Prisoner by Theeues, and carryed to Aneroestvs his Court, who then reigned ouer diuers parts about the Alpes ; and there so brought vp by the good Kings care, as in that estate, and at those yeeres, hee had all vsage worthy the dignity of a King; and that from thence hee had beene, by the chance of warre, and a most happy captiuity, againe restored to his yet vnknowne Parents: but before he was restored to the honour of his birth, and acknowledged by his Father, Aneroestvs , in a rebellion of his owne Subiects, was slaine (as it was reported) with two Sonnes hee had in a battell: his Sonnes bodies indeed were found among the heapes of the slaine, but Aneroestvs was neuer heard of: whom if Fortune, sauing him out of that slaughter, had reserued to that day, then hee should thinke the gods loued him, and should hold his life happy without exception: but it were folly to hope for so great ioy vpon so small grounds. The Souldier might be deceyued: or perhaps the Priest, if he knew himselfe to be any thing like Aneroestvs , might, with a vaine ambition to be thought so, giue occasion to all this Fable. But all meanes should be vsed to know the truth. Hee had many in his Campe, that had beene of that Kings Court; and amongst the rest, one well recouered, as vnder colour of offering to the god, would goe to the Temple, whither the Priest had retyred himselfe. with him to the Temple. Crestor , sometimes one most inward with search out the truth, while Poliarchvs and the Queene make themselues ready to follow. It was too great a hope for Crestor to conceiue. So, neerer to despising the newes, and calling to his sad soule the remembrance of his dearest King, as if hee were going about an idle businesse to no purpose, with some few in his company, enters the Groue, and, not farre from the Temple Porch, found these Priests still talking with the French Souldier, that first discouered the matter. Then, as if he desired to speake with the Souldier, looking round about him, cast his eyes vpon Aneroestvs . Instantly all his bloud (as in great and sudden ioyes it often falls out) runnes to his heart. But when afterwards hee found by his gesture, speech, and scarres, that without question he was his King, his sinewes loosened; and fainting with ioy, he betooke himselfe to leane against the next Tree, being now neyther able to speak nor stirre. But Aneroestvs was no lesse amazed at his comming. The sight of his old friend, strucke him at vnawares with a most pleasant sadnesse: and he feared withall, lest being discouered by his owne people, he should be forced to leaue his sweet solitary life. In the meane time was Poliarchvs come, with much impatience following forgetting himselfe, leauing the Priests, comes to him. And now well shewing, by his amazed and almost breathlesse gladnesse, what newes he brought; Wee haue here Aneroestvs , said hee; Wee haue here my old King, your Foster- father: It is hee; doubt nothing, It is hee. Will you goe to him, Sir? or shall I bring him hither to you? path, where the Groue was thickest; intending, if hee could, to hide himselfe for that day; thorow Desarts, and vnknowne Countries, to seeke new Temples, and new gods; and intreated the Souldier, that if hee would obey him as his King, hee would eyther beare him company in his flight, or further his escape with concealing it. But the Souldier flatly refused; and while they were in contention about it, Poliarchvs came, now halfe assured, that certainely it was Aneroestvs . But when hee was come to him; because a huge multitude were gathered together, and the vexed old man could not indure this tumult, hee feigned another reason of his comming: I am glad (quoth he) that the French deuotion is become so renowned in forreine Nations. I would desire you (reuerend Sir) to pray to the gods on my behalfe, that they will be gracious and fauourable to my designes: Come, I beseech you, into the Temple, where you may more conueniently shew mee, what Vowes or Sacrifices you thinke would be most auayleable. Aneroestvs at these words almost bloudlesse, followed him that led him: for, Poliarchvs held him fast by the left hand. It was a little Chappell, and the Souldiers kept backe the disorderly multitude at the doores. Hyanisbe , with some of her principall Nobles, stood in the Porch, whither when Poliarchvs was come with Aneroestvs , with about forty men following him, the Gate was presently shut by people and Souldiers. The Townes-men ranne out of the Citie, and the Campe had scarce men enow left to guard it. So, the Temple was round about inuironed with a most thicke prease: yet, whether it were for the reuerence to the Princes that were within; or strangenesse of this great and sudden accident; the noyse  & disorder of the people was quickly so well restrayned and quieted, that the Princes had liberty, without disturbance, for their free discourse within. And now was Poliarchvs entring into a long speech, when Micipsa came from Archombrotvs to Hyanisbe : for, hee much wondring at the noyse of the people, and at that time not farre from the Groue, wished to be present at so great a businesse, if Poliarchvs were content. should receiue, he had it from the others victory. Deferring therefore further question, they stayed for the comming of Archombrotvs ; who being let into the Chappell, Poliarchvs begun to Aneroestvs in this manner; What name (worthy Sir) would your Parents haue you to be of? or, What was the cause of your departure from France to Sardinia ? Aneroestvs , seeing him vse such a quicke preamble, brought him on purpose to the question hee intended: for, hee had both re-collected his spirits, which at the first were somewhat danted; and he perceiued, that though hee persisted neuer so much in silence, or denying of himselfe, yet his face had discouered him, not only to hee) I doe not yet know, but that I take you, by your Purple Robe, to be a King; and your Language the same with that of France . I should thinke you my friend, because I see you haue some of my old friends with you; for, I know therefore by all the gods request you to suffer mee to depart, whither I purpose. But if perchance you hate mee, what further punishment would you inflict? I haue lost my Crowne; and seeke it not againe; I am a voluntary exile; that euen my enemies may feare no harme from mee. I am contented to want; and whether I desire to be vnknowne or no, they best know, by whom I was this day discouered. Lo, I forget my former estate: heape yet more misery vpon mee: there is nothing, but the anger of the gods, that I will refuse. But further, if you doe not thinke, or if it be not for your auayle, to haue mee be Aneroestvs ; feare nothing. Giue mee but leaue to retyre my selfe to my solitary course; and where no man shall compell me to the truth, I will be  meeting. An excellent discourse of Aneroestvs , touching the course of the World; and of an austere life.  heard him without griefe, chiefly when Crestor taking him by the hand, shewed the Scarre, which all his Countrey-men well remembred, King minde that face, which hee had so often seene when hee was a Boy. Hee also remembred his manner of speech and voyce, though long since discontinued: and his heart panted with the tender feeling of piety. But not yet reuealing himselfe, hee demanded of Aneroestvs , Why he left his Countrey? Why hee would liue so obscurely, so poorely? Alas (said hee) my Subiects know too well, some of whom I see here, with what violence Fortune beat mee downe. By the rage of my wicked Subiects, I was forced to take Armes: They presumed to leade an Army against mee; and my Sonnes (for I had two, then entring into the flowre of their youth) while both of them too aduentrously fight for their Father, in their Fathers sight were slaine. I might then haue dyed with them, if Fate had pleased: but, I thinke, it was the will of the gods to inforce mee to flight. I hid my selfe in the next Groue: from thence, with hope to finde forreine succours, I got ouer the tops of the Mountaines into Ligurie : for, those warlike Nations had promised to ioyne with mee in all fortunes. By their helpe I hoped to re-gaine my Kingdome. When I came to the next Sea-coast, to goe to the famous City built by Ianvs , I shipped my selfe, being a Stranger, in a Ship I found by chance: but, by a contrary winde, we were driuen to Sardinia ; and while the Mariners cast anchor, the fame of the Temple, from whence I am now brought, inuited mee to make my Vowes to the Priests, I resolued to lay aside all cares; and hauing beene tossed with so many miseries, at last to try the gods: for, why should I loue my Countrey, stayned with the bloud of so many of my people; and which was not to be re- gayned, but with the bloud of my friends, as well as of my enemies? Besides, to whom should I leaue my Crowne? or, what pleasure was there in a childe- lesse House. I had onely two Sonnes of my owne, and Fortune had formerly giuen mee a third, whom I loued no lesse than with a fatherly affection, whom (after my Grand-fathers name) I called Scordanes . My deare Foster-childe, if thou wert yet liuing, I would adopt thee my Sonne, and raise thee to be a King: Thou shouldest re-comfort me, after all these chances of warre, misfortunes, and labours. But he, long before any likelihood or beginning of so many mischiefes, while wee make warre vpon the French that possesse the Rhosne , was made a booty, for the Enemies, and the memory of his losse hath not since left mee a day free from sorrow. So sadly he related these misfortunes, as Poliarchvs could no longer defer his comfort; but hauing long kept in his teares, which on the sudden melt, he cast himselfe vpon his necke; and stopping a little, that his speech being broken with sighs, might not wrong his Maiesty; Oh, honoured Father, said hee, or if you had rather I should call you Lord; if you thinke it such a blessing to haue Scordanes againe, Lo, I restore him to you: enioy him freely, and returne to a happy life; I am Scordanes . At these words, both of them with fixed, but dimme eyes, almost fainted, in these sweet and pleasing apprehensions. No lesse was the admiration of all the standers by, as appeared by their silence; so as they had no time to speake a word, or aske a question. They were all confounded with wonder, bending their open and ready affections, which way the discourse of Poliarchvs and At length, said Aneroestvs ; That you should be Scordanes , O King? I say, my Scordanes ? That you liue, and reigne, and haue Aneroestvs in your Armes? Oh good gods! By what token will you gods assure mee of this your gift? But, said Poliarchvs , you see heere, besides, him that hath taken reuenge both for you and the gods, whom your impious Subiects violated in expelling of you. The Villaines are slaine, eyther in the fight, or by the Lictors axes. I haue taken the prey from them, and inioy your Kingdome, which now (deare Father) hauing found you liuing, I restore you. You will aske mee, with what Forces I thus preuayled against your Enemies? I waged this warre as the Sonne of Britomandes . And now I giue vp vnto you my Fathers Kingdome: for the gods haue lately taken him vp amongst you: To you, to you, (deare Father) am I but second: It will be greater glory to obey you, then to command others. He, re-comforted with this vnexpected ioy, & often with his eyes & vowes looking vp towards the gods, imbraced Poliarchvs . And now Hyanisbe came in; and Archombrotvs , vpon this finding of Aneroestvs , gratulated to himselfe the fauour of the gods, and his owne victory. Neither did Poliarchvs deny, but that Archombrotvs had done as much for him by this chance, as hee had done for him in the death of Radirobanes. Crestor, Simplidas , and the rest, as they might, comming to Aneroestvs , could neuer be enough satisfied with kisses, and speaking to him. Aboue all things, the Souldier, that had first knowne Aneroestvs , bragged of his good seruice, and insulted mainly, partly for ioy, and partly for hope of reward. went next before, vshering his Mother. So going out of the Temple, they could hardly get passage thorow the Souldiers, and prease of the people. While all men striue to shew their affection, while they desire to see and be seene; the wayes, how broad soeuer, were filled with throngs of people, both from the City and the Campe: for, euen those, whom neyther Aneroestvs , nor France any way concerned; yet, eyther to flatter the glad Princes, or of themselues being prone to excessiue mirth, neuer gaue ouer salutation and applause. When they were come to the Court, there were some ready, by Poliarchvs his command, to change Aneroestvs his pouerty for Princely Robes. But hee sometimes held fast his owne attyre, and sometimes, with his hand, put backe the Purple: whereat Poliarchvs wondring, and intreating him to lay by that habit of sorrow; hee said, The gods had not so deserued at his hands, that hee should goe out of their seruice. It had fallen out happily, that He enioyed his Kingdome, whom hee had euer wished to make his Heire: For the future, hee would neuer more meddle with the cares and troubles of worldly businesses: They should not take from him his pleasing pouertie; nor thinke, hee should bee vnprofitable to his friends affaires, who, the neerer hee came to the accesse of the gods, might (hee made no doubt) the easlier winne them to fauour his friends. This great and earnest obstinacy of the good old man, in defence of a retyred life, offered matter of seuerall discourse; while some prayse his constancy, and others wonder, how such strictnesse in manners should auayle to the worship of the gods: for, Poliarchvs himselfe wanted not arguments wherewith to reproue this austere resolution of Aneroestvs , and re-call him, that was so backward, to the exercise of his Kingly Office. him to the same effect) with a most patient silence; insomuch, that many beleeued, that these arguments were vsed against a minde that would be glad to be conquered. So, pawzing a good space; whether it were, that he might with one speech confute all that they had said, or else, that gayning time, hee might bee the better prepared for his defence, and deserue the like audience from them all, at length modestly casting vp his countenance, hee began to this effect: That there is a supreme prouidence, that framed all things; the very condition of the Sunne neuer wandring out of his course, and the order of the Moone, and the rest of the Starres, and the whole worke of Nature doth sufficiently perswade such men, whom neyther the proud conceit of their owne wisdome, nor a worse then brutish negligence hath not blinded. But can you thinke, this holy power, from whom so many excellent things proceed; God, I meane, who is the originall of all vertues, and hath giuen man a soule indued with reason, and prescribed to him, what is iust and lawfull, can be delighted with those vices, with which generally we haue corrupted our Natures? None, but a most iust God, could haue giuen this Law of Nature which we see: but he cannot be iust, if he should suffer so many sins to escape vnpunished. Whosoeuer therefore hath his heart touched with the loue of truth, & a desire of the fauour of the gods, with a feare of the diuine wrath, ought, aboue all things, to shun the danger of those vices, that now are infamous by the vtter ruine of so many mortals. But these dangers are, some of them, engrafted in vs, some of them deriued from others: and against all these sinnes wee finde this religious and solitary life, to be a powerfull remedy: for, first, immoderate desires, wherewith our selues doe our selues most harme, are by this course of life so dis-armed of all their power and violence, as if, when you would tame wilde Beasts, you should take away their teeth and nayles, that in case they should grow wilde againe, they might not haue wherewith to doe you harme: for, the desire of pleasures by the contrary vse of austerity, loses his strength in vs; and, if that flame should rise againe, as it were, out of the ashes; yet will it doe no harme in the empty and vnfurnished houses of our bodies, where the instruments of superfluous luxury are wanting. Couetousnesse also is disappoynted by simple pouertie: and a meane and abiect life, that despises it selfe, doth blush at pride. So, those; so the rest of the corruptions of the minde; as anger, enuy, feare, presumption, in this holy and seuere retyrednesse, as wanting matter to nourish them, doe easily vanish; especially where the Soule hauing cast off the yoke of these vices, restores her selfe to her full liberty, and our fearefull affections, before they dare will or nill any thing, aske counsell of reason. By this meanes, wee that are our owne greatest Enemies, by cutting off, or curbing the power of vnbridled Nature, are brought to sound and profitable vertue. I come now to those cruell and too certaine darts, that are shot against vs by the infectious conuersation with others; for, I beleeue, more men sinne out of example, then naturall inclination: because wee desire to please our friends in sympathy of conditions, and it is a rare thing to liue long with wicked men, and not at first to thinke so hardly of their vices as they deserue, and afterwards be infected with them our selues. Other mens ambition enflames our pride: and other mens couetousnesse, our hunting after wealth. Being ouer- reached by fraud, at least, to be reuenged, you will apply your minde, that perhaps before was innocent, to fraud likewise, and by your Enemies malice to you, learne to hate him againe. Besides, whereas many men doe hold euen the boldnesse of sinning a poynt of manly honour; and esteeme such as Cowards, and vnsit for imployment, which keepe in obedience to the gods; many accustome themselues to sinne, through feare of this disgrace; rather indeed to approue themselues to such as regard not vertue, then for that themselues are in loue with their vices. But the vprightnesse of our Society remoues all these temptations out of their way, that are entred into it; in which, (to speake in a word) wee shunne the infection of wicked men, and haue free liberty to feare the gods, without suspicion of Cowardise. But, to come neerer to my selfe, how often doth the malice of Fortune, and the crossenesse of businesse, inuite Kings and Princes with strong temptations, and great rewards, to sinne? chiefly, when things so fall out, as that what is iust and lawfull, seemes to derogate from their honour, or policy of State? And vpon such occasion, to dissemble, to ouer-reach, to doe contrary to their owne words, are held noble and glorious parts in Kings; as if the gods had giuen them this rule ouer other mortals, whom they would not giue them power to gouerne, without the helpes of vices and wickednesses? Sometimes they loue to set variance betweene their neighbouring and well-deseruing Princes, that others being in action, and in misery, they may inioy the safer quiet. Sometimes, they doe with bribes sollicit the friends and seruants of their confederate Princes to Treason. What thinke you of their sometimes punishing the innocent for caution to others, as it were a crime to be able to offend? What of their slighting their poorer Subiects wrongs; so as the Souldier, or such as are seruiceable for warre, doe them? Hee that can carry these things with most cunning, gaines so much the more glory; so, that I thinke, there are many here present, that wonder that I haue reproued these things, as vniust, or misliked of the gods. And yet these things haue made my gouernement burdensome to mee; not then indeed, when I reigned my selfe, and offended in this, or the like kinde; but after the myst of profit and custome was cleared vp, then, as it were, being made a Iudge of both courses, I saw, and wondred at the Cloud out of which I had escaped. Pardon mee, noble Queene, and you my Sonne; I condemne not your estate: It is for valiant spirits, and such as you are, to bridle your great fortunes with the sacred curbe of vertue, and take downe such swelling desires. But I, that am weaker, am afraid of my disabilitie to indure these stormes. Neyther is the state of Kings onely subiect to these dangers: Vices doe lay wait for all sorts, and almost all ages. And there is a powerfull remedy against all these, out of our Discipline, which commands vs, little to esteeme of those things, for which others commit such offences. interrupts him in his speech. But, good Father (said he) if we should all be of your mind, we should not haue Citizens to inhabit our Townes; the Husbandman would not till his ground; nor the Mariner and Passenger passe into forreine parts to exchange his commodities, and bring home new. No Art nor Trade would be followed, but such as your seuerity should allow of, as necessary for mankinde. No concourse of men, but in your Desarts; and since you refuse Marriages, man-kinde would end in one Age. lookes and gesture to assent vnto him, as defending the publique cause. But chearefull looke, so as you might perceiue, hee was but a little moued with vs, said hee, haue a minde to try the sweetnesse that our life brings with it; let not your Arguments, my Sonne, deterre him, or make him beleeue, that his chastitie will euer vn-people the World, as you feare. Let him come willingly vnto vs. There will be poore enow left to breed Children; Trades will still flourish; and enow remayning not onely to people the Townes, and manure the ground, but also for the Fates (in such plentifull increase of Mankinde) to consume whole troupes by Pestilence, Earth-quakes, Warre, and such like. Cast that feare aside, I say, that all sorts of people should haue a desire to giue themselues to the Discipline of our Sicily : and, the gods hold it too great a fauour to be bestowed vpon all people: for, none without their impulsion can euer come to haue this will; nor continue it without their assistance; because their mindes being weary of worldly pleasures (all which wee renounce) would flye them, as the most contemptible misery, were it not for the secret food of diuine Religion. But as the Generall giues pay to none but such as are duly entred in the Muster-booke: so the gods giue this taste of sweet and lasting content to those alone, whom themselues haue called to this kinde of life. If any one therefore, not so much friend to himselfe, as angry with Fortune, (because perhaps hee hath fayled in his hope, or ambition) shall cast anchor at our Hauen with a turbulent affection, where he presumes, hee may lawfully repine and complaine of the Fates; this man, I thinke, will not long continue in our profession, vnlesse, by the especiall helpe of the gods, hee cast off his old affections; and bee more likely to make our dispositions worse, then to better his owne. Besides, such as of a light fancy (as that of youth often is,) and of a tender and inconsiderate conceit, they haue apprehended of the rewards of vertue, come to our toyle and exercise; these, as stones cast with a fling, are at the first extremely feruent in these studies; but the Engine ceasing, they wonder at their owne dulnesse. Besides the spurres of deuotion, and the feare of the gods; there is requisite vnderstanding, courage, and patience; all which together happen but to a few. Our Discipline consists not in the habit wee weare, or in the Name and House of our profession; no, nor in our bodily labours: for, couetousnesse and pride draw men often to greater toyle; and condemned men indure more paynes in the Mynes, or the Gallies. It is onely the single and chearefull propension towards the gods, that makes all these things holy in vs, which otherwise were idle, and often-times prophane. Certainely, to despise wealth, to forsake honours, to disburden the minde of the cares of worldly businesse, is a great vertue, if it be done onely with intent to serue and please the gods. But if any one forsakes honour, or riches, to make a boast of his free resignation, or with intent to come to more; if any man giue ouer his worldly businesse, to sleepe in idlenesse; or boast of voluntary pouertie, which when hee saw hee must needes indure, hee tooke this course to preuent it, that it might not seeme hee was forced to it; this man, I thinke, with this vnprofitable fraud, is willing to coozen not men onely, but euen the gods themselues. I doe not therefore (Sonne) enioyne all men to this profession: for, in so huge a number of men, few will be willing to seeke after this vnknowne happinesse of a retired life: and of those few, there be some, that following their owne will, and not the will of the gods, put themselues into this course, either to no purpose, or to their owne destruction. But you will say, I wish this mind to al good men at least, that they should retire themselues to vs out of the troubles of worldly affaires. No, I wish not that: for, who should make iust warre against wicked people? Who should gouerne the Common-wealth? Or where should a curbe be had for headstrong vices, if all goodnesse should so giue it selfe vp to solitarinesse and pouerty, that being out of sight, and wanting power, it were not able by force or shame to withstand the naughtinesse of lewd and dissolute persons? It is a great charge the gods haue laid vpon such, to whom they giue command, either in right of their birth, or by secret inspiration, to fight against vices; and not to kill mens affections, but to gouerne them. It concernes the Publike, that both such men should bee, and should haue Honours; and as well to gouerne in sacred things, as to bee Fathers of Families; and being mingled on this Globe of the earth with the wicked, to restraine their insolent boldnesse against the gods, and auert the angry decrees of the gods from mortall men. To speake nothing of other men, What is more excellent than a wise and valiant King? If he shall, by example and by good Lawes, amend the Age; if he shall draw others in imitation of him to the worship of the gods; how much more fruit will come by such vertue, than if he should grow old in a retired and obscure holinesse? You will aske me then, Why I desire not this greater glory at the hands of the gods? Because they haue, to my priuate apprehension, giuen me notice of their wills, that I should comfort and delight my old age with peace; and should not take care for my Kingdome, which I lost not, but by their decree. But at this time, they seeme especially to command me to keepe on this course of retirednesse, which I haue begun; since I vnderstand, the whole estate of my House and Kingdome, deare Sonne, is falne vnto you: the happinesse of so worthy an Heyre, which the gods haue bestowed vpon me, perswades me, that I should not take away my Crowne from him, vpon whom I would most willingly haue established it. I know what you will say further, my good Sonne; If I so eagerly fly from businesse; if I be now only pleased with the Temples, Sacrifices, and the worship of the gods; yet in so great an estate as yours is, there shall be troupes of seruants at my command, to make ready my beds, to prouide my diet, and attend me to the Temple: and that such wealth brings no danger or trouble with it, because, while I shall haue free liberty to serue the gods, you will take vpon you the managing of State-affaires, together with those whom you shall place ouer my Family. But assuredly, you shall not so perswade mee to cast off the freedome of pouerty. For, though a man be free from the care and trouble of getting and keeping wealth, yet excesse hath many other inconueniences; the custome of delicates; the pampering of the body; the forgetfulnesse of deuotion, as if it were a needlesse matter; and then those affections which are necessarily incident to wealth; to thinke highly of ones selfe; to despise others, as being farre below him; to indure no shew of iniury; and to be corrupted with the soothing of those, that onely seeke the reward of their flattery. Nor doe I thinke it any iot easier, admitting wealth and abundance, to auoyd other ill affections; than in a troubled Sea, to yeeld to one violent surging billow, and not to be tossed with the succeeding waues. Since therefore I haue a desire to spend the remainder of my life in the seruice of the gods; let me be suffered to anoy all superfluity, so dangerous to my intendments, lest with the taste of that, and of those affections which it euer brings with it, my weake and captiue soule giue it selfe ouer againe to vices; and my dull and clogged thoughts, in vaine soring towards heauen, stoope to earth againe. Why doe you wonder that I so affect this pouerty, beeing indeed such, as wherein I would not starue, but yet be content with a little; such, as may cause the neglected body thinke meanely of it selfe; such, as may giue the vntroubled mind free liberty for the contemplation of heauenly things; and such, that you may not thinke me regardlesse of your Honour and safety, as may procure the gods to be fauourable and successefull vnto you, my sonne, in your warres and enterprises? Hee deliuered this seuere speech with so milde and well-settled a countenance, as it well appeared, this resolution was not faigned, nor such as hee had a desire to giue ouer by the inforcement of his friends. And while all that were present, honoured (as is vsuall) this reall and vncounterfeited vertue in him; Yet at least, said Poliarchvs , deny vs not, good Father, your company into Sicily . The gods will fauour you; whether by Land or Sea, you will make our iourney prosperous. When we shall be once returned into France , I faithfully promise you, you shall liue in what course your selfe please. And certainely, so much loue you owe your Countrey, by your example to make it better. they all went to eate together. For, by this time, Poliarchvs , somewhat better brooking Archombrotvs , supper with him at Hyanisbe's Table: and hauing now indifferently well recouered his strength, agreed with the Queene vpon the day of their departure, which should be the second day after. and deliuers it to her Sonne, with the Casket that Poliarchvs had taken from the Pirates; often giuing him charge, carefully to keepe it, as a thing whereon his life and fortunes depended, and deliuer it to Meleander . But thinke, said she, you haue Erichthonivs giuen you by Pallas . If you breake open the Seale, or looke in what you carry, you vndoe your selfe, and lose all my labour. But when you shall deliuer this Casket vntouched to finde how much you are bound to giue King Poliarchvs thankes, who tooke it from the Pirates that had stolne it. Then was it debated whether they should goe both in one ship. But state and  aemulation required more secure Councels. It was thought safer they should both goe euen in seuerall Fleets; but hee that first arriued, should stay for the other in the Port: from thence they should both of them be content to goe together with a ioynt Trayne to the Court. In the meane time, Archombrotvs bestowed vpon his seruants the Titles and Offices accustomed in the Courts of Kings. Himselfe was adorned with the Robes & other marks of Maiestie, and by his Mother called The King of Sardinia , that he might not bee inferiour in dignity to his Riuall. And Hyanisbe well remembring, how shee was preserued by the prowesse of the French , gaue to euery one of the French Souldiers a Largesse. Their departure being proclaimed, no sort of people were idle. Many of the Mauritanian Nobility attending their Prince, filled vp the shipping. The Sicilians that came with Archombrotvs , had a faction amongst themselues: for many of them renewed their ancient loue to Poliarchvs . His heroicall vertue, his valour, that had beene farre spred vnder the name of Theocrine , and his sweet behauiour, so powerfully winning vpon mens affections, then most preuailed, when they saw him a King. And againe, in as much as vertue, and that they came out of Sicily vnder his command, they were ashamed to goe from him to his Corriuall: for the marriage with Argenis , which was of most force to draw their hearts, was so doubtfull, that their affections stood equally ballanced; and each side shewed no rough nor vnciuill vsage to the other, lest, if the aduerse part should get the better, they might want meanes for excuse and reconciliation. There was an ancient Altar vpon the shore, vnknowne, what King was the Founder; much famed for the seruice of the gods, after so many ages. There did the poore Mariners vse to offer sacrifice or Incense to Neptvne and the Winds, when they put to Sea, or came safe to Land. To this Altar Hyanisbe brought Poliarchvs and her Sonne, as they were ready to take ship. Neither doe I doubt, said she, but both of you will faithfully keepe the promise you haue made mee. Yet hitherto I haue onely taken order for passed discontents betweene you; but I knowe, how easily many accidents may fall out betweene Princes desirous of difference, whereby they may suppose or giue out themselues to be freed from the Articles of truce between them. Besides, there may arise new stirres by the fault of your friends or Souldiers, not comprehended within your League. If any such thing happen, I desire you would be bound heere each to other, vpon the holy Altar of that god, whose watrie Kingdome you are now entring into, that you will reckon such new contentions amongst these old ones, whereof each of you hath deferred the reuenge for my sake; that no stir or tumult preuent the happinesse whereto I send you. Take heed, deare Young-men, and pardon a Woman that takes care for your sakes. I shall in the meane time commend you both with equall prayers to the gods: for if I can find in mine owne heart, whether of you I am more carefull of, I beseech the gods, neither of you may take heede to the charge I giue you, nor euer see me aliue againe. They are conquered with this ingenuous and hearty loue of hers, and confirme by oath vpon the Altar, what she requested. Then she imbraces them both; and sometimes applies herselfe to the one, sometimes to the other, as they passed along the shore, often and earnestly iterating the same charge: And not satisfied with earnestly eying them at their parting, after leaue taken, and farewell giuen, she calls them back to talk afresh with the. Neither were they vntrobled at so many sighes of hers. She also earnestly perswades Aneroestvs , that was to goe in the same ship with inuiolate between them. Neither Poliarchvs nor Archombrotvs would deny him any thing: hee might preuaile with both of them, as their Father, and the Interpreter of the gods. How often were men, especially young men, to be enforced to their own good and safety? Lastly, he should consider, how the greatest charge in Europe and Africa was committed to his trust. her, and the young-men, but chiefly of the gods, hee would not faile in well- looking to his charge.  Victory. His mistrust of Gobrias .  conducted to his Nauy, Archombrotvs himselfe keeping him company to the Sea side. The Sacrifices were slaine, according to the custome; whose inwards the two Princes, after Prayers for the fauour of Neptvne , and the gods that rule the Sea, both together cast into the next waues. Afterwards, resounded at the noyse of the Mariners, the bustling of the Cables, and the Oares plowing vp the Sea. The Souldiers also sounded the Trumpets, placed for shew in conuenient parts of the Ship. Timonides was in doubt, whether hee should bee merry or sad; because the charge of his Embassie hindred his returne into his Countrey. For he assured himselfe, all things would be in combustion there: and at such a time, it were questionable, whether it were better to bee absent, or to make one in the storme. Yet, according to the nature of man, when both wayes were dangerous, hee chose to returne; and for no other cause, but because he was forbidden. But for the faithfull keeping of the Truce, the Kings had agreed, That if any of the French gaue offence, like, should receiue his iudgement from the French . And that they might not fall foule one vpon another, they deuided their Fleetes; Archombrotvs keeping somewhat below the other; and Poliarchvs taking the open Sea, and (that hee might not bee a let to Archombrotvs ) going somewhat more about than needed. There was a Poet of Sicily , who, when he would haue presented these few lines to the Princes at their departure, was kept backe by betweene them, the memory whereof was not thought fit to be renewed.  Blue Neptvne's Waues, and Winds, that oft doe teare Ships in your wrath; now your lowd fury spare. Or'e th' liquid path, that leades to Sicily , Onely the South-winds gentle wings let fly. When crosse the Seas from faire Thessalia's shore, Those god-like Kings the famous Argo bore, More grace she had not, nor more trust the Sea. Europe and Lybia's gods, me thinkes, I see To all kind offices themselues diuide. Some draw the Cables, some the Sterne doe guide, Before the stemmes some smooth the wauy way; Some with the Sayles make prosperous gales to play: But most of all, the snowy-winged Peace, By Iove's command doth thus assuage the Seas, Embracing both the Nauies with each wing; Be milde, ye waues, quoth she, to those you bring. Dare not to hope, fell Discord, thou canst throw Warre 'twixt these sacred Fleets: for, warre enough And feares, already haue the Court possest. These Princes hearts belong to Me; whose rest I will confirme; nor need I peace despaire, Because these Kings of martiall spirits are. That vertue, that in battell does increase Their furious heate, can make them milde in peace. Many dayes were passed, since Arsidas arriued in Sicily , with the Letters of Poliarchvs and Timonides , to Meleander and Argenis : and not long after him, came Bocchvs from Hyanisbe and with Radirobanes in Mauritania , had taken his Enemies life from him. This some Merchants reported, who vpon the discomfiture of Radirobanes , and before Archombrotvs was arriued with his Sicilian Fleet, had left Africa . Meleander , somewhat moued at the strangenesse of this newes, commanded the chiefe of the Merchants to be called vnto him, and seriously demands of him, whether he reported this by heare-say, or had beene present at the battell. The Marchant answered, that he was then in Mauritania , when King Poliarchvs first landed his Army for the defence of Queene Then he told, how they had fought twice; how Radirobanes was slaine by by stealth. He could hardly make Meleander beleeue him; who casting in his mind the misfortune of Radirobanes , and Hyanisbe's happinesse, stucke most at the name of Poliarchvs ; whether this were hee that was his preseruer, he that was enemy to Lycogenes , he that vnder a priuate habit had once beene deare vnto him, and afterward iniuriously expelled. Neither did Argenis lesse muse, (for she also had receiued the same newes from the Merchant) being glad indeed, but for many respects iealous. She especially wondred, what businesse Poliarchvs had of such waight with succour her. Did he then make an end of the warre for his Riuall, who knew not of the good done him; vnmindfull of his faith and returne, while euery day, euery priuate place offered new occasion of teares to his Loue? Shee hated would haue Poliarchvs depriued of her: and hee, forgetfull of his loue to her, and hatred to him, had giuen such aid to his enemy, that he might come backe a more glorious wooer into Sicily . Yet was the Ladies greeued mind well pleased with the death of Radirobanes ; and being ready to thinke the best of Poliarchvs ; Perchance, said shee, he fought not for Hyanisbe , but for mee: nor had so much minde to helpe a more welcome fortune, than the death of Radirobanes : and the gods haue doubled their fauours, that hee receiued his punishment from the hand of victory, for which Poliarchvs was so much honoured, and had hope shortly to receiue some Letters from him. For, it had luckily hapned, that the Merchant either had not heard in Mauritania , in what danger he lay wounded, or else, in his relation of other newes to Meleander and Argenis , had negligently omitted this. But when Arsidas came out of Africa , as the newes was more certaine, so a more eager passion troubled the Princes mindes. For hee presenting the Letters sent by Poliarchvs and Timonides to the King, set forth the same things contained in them with a longer discourse; chiefely insisting vpon the praises of Poliarchvs , how great a Kingdome he was reported to raigne ouer, and what a braue Nauy he had brought with him, fraught with able men, and furnished with all war-like prouision; how valiantly hee had fought against the Sardinians , and how, being hardly recouered of his wounds, he had beene troubled with rage, hatred, and emulation at the sight of condiscended, either to be made friends by the reconciliation of Meleander , or to pursue their vttermost reuenge in Sicily . Neither did Arsidas much dissemble the cause of their quarrell, which he knew Timonides had written at large, and would be made publikely knowne by Bocchvs , that was to come presently after him. But when he came to Argenis , and enhanced all things in the deliuery, (as they are wont, that speake of things done farre off, and beleeue themselues to be willingly heard) shee was quickly freed of the iealous thoughts wherewith she had been troubled. Gobrias was made partaker of all this ioy; and taking his fit times, met, sometimes priuately, sometimes publikely with Argenis or Arsidas . And about the same time came Bocchvs , and confirmed what Arsidas had reported. But Meleander , little relying vpon the hope and comfort hee tooke in the expulsion of Radirobanes , expected now, as it were, his certaine ruine. It was not for nothing, that Gobrias came with his French into Sicily . Lycogenes or the Sardinians could haue done him but little harme: but what Armes or power had Sicily , to withstand the forces of France and Mauritania ? In these doubts, and angry with his fortune, hee wills nothing doubted, but her Father had sent for him, to question him about these newes. She therefore aduises him at his parting, that he should not deale fearefully, or dissemble any thing touching his King. The case now so stood, that it was fit by degrees to plucke off the vizard. It happened, that hee that was sent to call Gobrias , told the King, he was in conference with Argenis , and would presently be with him. And this also strooke Meleander into a deeper suspition. Yet looking cheerefully vpon concealed your Kings name? to whom I am indeed so farre obliged, that you haue brought mee within the compasse of ingratitude, in not suffering me, for his sake, to giue you better entertainement? Gobrias excused his silence; for none knew better than Meleander himselfe, that such as are made priuate with the affaires of their Princes, are not at their owne power. That he feared to vtter, what (for ought he knew) his King would haue concealed. would be there within few dayes. But you knew this long since, Gobrias (said he) and therefore stayed for him heere with your Fleet. Yea; but (said disseuered me from the rest of my Nauy: and since that time, I neither saw my King, nor my companions. But I touched vpon this Iland, because, though I knew not whither my King was bound, or what his Designe was, yet I heard him say, he was to direct his course by the Coast of Sicily .  The apprehensions of Meleander . The Arriuall of Poliarchvs and  him, retires to his Closet, where hee runnes ouer many vnquiet thoughts; As, why Poliarchvs should send Gobrias before him? Why he himselfe should come out of France with so great a Nauy, vnlesse it were to winne hitherto neglected Archombrotvs vpon these hopes? Whether shee her selfe had not been the mouer of these troubles from France ? Then came feare-shaken mind; and, to make vp his misery full, the feare of his own Daughter. He also remembred the vertues of Poliarchvs , how he had in a Virgins habit preserued him; and had all Noble gifts, worthy his Sonne-in-law. Then againe, the shame for his expulsion, and in that he had suffered him to depart not without danger, made him afraid to shew any loue vnto him: for he conceiued, Poliarchvs had iust cause to hate and despise him. Lastly, if he were minded to take him for his Sonne-in-law, yet besides the blot of lightnesse and inconstancy, hee had a respect to the Lawes of his Countrey, which forbade any marriage with the Kings of France : and withall, considered the power of Archombrotvs , that was lately growne greater with the strength of Mauritania , and the loue of the Sicilians . Neither would hee haue forborne chiding with his Daughter, but not yet knowing what the gods had determined; that he might not giue offence to him that should be his Sonne-in-law of the two Corriuals; he bridled his anger; saue that once these words fell from him in his passion; You looke for not to see him, vnlesse hee come imbrued, either in his own, or She, with a prepared silence, and settled countenance, let these words passe, as if shee had not vnderstood them. But Cleobvlvs and Evrymedes , and the rest of the Nobility, begun now to bee more backward in their politique aduices; fearing the King, if they went about any harme to Archombrotvs ; and assuring themselues, that in the least wrong to Poliarchvs , they should offend Argenis. Gobrias was afraid, he should, in this great hurly- burly, be comanded to leaue the Court. To preuent therfore an enforced departure, he goes backe to his shipping, as it were, to looke to his Fleete; which he had ready in the Rode, as hee had before concluded with Argenis . About this time, Poliarchvs was brought with a happy gale of wind neere the Ile. The Lilyb aean Promontory first shewed it selfe: and not long after, they come, with the cheerefull labour of the Mariners, that made a huge noise with their Oares, within more certaine kenne of Land. At last they cast anchor before Æ gusa ; Poliarchvs being in doubt, whether to seeke Lilyb aeum to enquire, and brought word, that Meleander was then at Palermo . Then turning his course towards Drepanum , and passing by Agathyrsun , neere to the Ile of Paconia , he met Gobrias with his Fleet. For he roued thereabouts, to bee at hand, in case he should receiue any command from Argenis. Poliarchvs hauing thus happily found him, could scarce satisfie himselfe with seeing and embracing him. And hee, sometimes kneeling to him, sometimes kissing his hand, was so ouer-ioyed to haue his King there in safety, and a Conquerour, that, notwithstanding his valour, his age, and his Sexe, he could not forbeare teares. Then begun he also to congratulate their victory with the rest of his chiefest friends; till hee had landed in Sicily with the Kings leaue; whether he had seene, or had beene with Argenis ; and lastly, what was their resolution, or their power in the Iland? He, relating all that had happened from his first comming, exceedingly gladded the King; sometimes extolling the fidelity of Argenis , and the constancy of her loue; and sometimes the African warre, whereof all mens mouthes were full with the fame and glory of his victory. But hee told him further, that Meleander , though he bore a shew of loue, appeared (neuerthelesse) not to bee his perfect friend from his heart: and that he was returned to his Fleet by the aduice of Argenis , to be ready vpon all occasions vpon the Coasts. Poliarchvs , hauing thus well informed himselfe, and beeing infinitely glad for this newes of Argenis , presently cast anchor, resoluing there (according to their appointment) to stay for the maine Sea gotten out of sight of them. They which brought Meleander first newes of Poliarchvs his Fleet, could hardly make him beleeue, he had brought such store of shipping and prouision for war. And now, on the point of so great  & imminent danger, he gaue little credit to Hyanisbe's Letters, that had promised, those forces should doe him no harme. He was rather angry with her, who had auerted this warre from her owne Countrey, and turned it vpon Sicily . Then hee sends for whether those Forces were prepared with purpose to make warre vpon Sicily ? for, hee knew well enough, that, without her knowledge and consent, inward with Poliarchvs , or acquainted with his intendments; neyther was hee, to her knowledge, an enemy to Sicily . But though she was made for dissembling, by her sex and many businesses, yet she could not hide her excessiue ioy; being only grieued for this, that the succours, now so neere, were so slow, and that Poliarchvs came not to the Court with his Army: for, no helpe seemed short or speedy enough to her, that was so impatient of any delay. But Archombrotvs , thinking to haue met with the King at Syracusa , was come almost to Pachynus , where, finding his errour, hee turnes backe to Lilyb aeum . And when the newes of his Forces also was brought to on the one side enraged for loue of Argenis ; and, on the other side, Hee knew well, that it would nothing auayle to their reconcilement, that they had become friends vpon that occasion, they would not haue come from Mauritania into Sicily in diuided Fleets. Sicily then in this sad difference, must be wasted vnder their fury; or the Sea at least be stayned with their blouds, and Argenis be wonne with the losse of one of them. What Scylla , what Charybdis did euer deuoure so much bloud? All Nations would hold Sicily fatall, and ominous, after the ruine of so great and worthy Princes. And lastly, how could hee himselfe indure the sight of loue Archombrotvs , laden with the spoyles of Poliarchvs ? Then hee inuokes the Law of Nations; for that he was depriued of the free power of bestowing his owne Daughter in marriage; and that his allyance and friendship should be sought by force, by armes, and in spite of his heart: yet in all these plunges, he did not wholly slacken the reines of gouernement. He presently musters Souldiers, such as were ablest and fittest for the warre: and places his Nauy in the Hauen, to make at least some shew of defence. But his chiefe confidence was in himselfe and Argenis : for, hee hoped to preuayle in any request with Archombrotvs ; and that Poliarchvs would deny Argenis nothing. While the Kings minde was thus troubled, newes is brought him, that continued in such peace and quiet, as if they were both one Nauy. And hee could scarcely beleeue him that told him, there were Embassadours in the Port, that said, they came from the two Kings, Poliarchvs and Archombrotvs : for, when Archombrotvs had ioyned his Forces with Poliarchvs vpon the Coast of Paconia , the Sicilians that were with him, hastening home into their Countrey, made suit to be presently set on shore. But both the Kings with one consent gaue command, that no Ship should depart from the Nauy,  & sent Gelanorvs and Micipsa in a small Barke to Meleander . Hee wondred at these Embassadours, comming from those two Princes both at once. And this also troubled Argenis : Were these two great Enemies agreed? Had either of them in such a quarrell yeelded to other? Which of them would winne the thankes for freeing Sicily from the warre? Vpon what termes, and vpon what conditions had they laide aside their enmity? Besides, it was a strange newes to heare Archombrotvs called a King; and Meleander feared, of their reconciliation; but Argenis could not imagine, whether she had more reason to be glad or sad; sane that she feared this atonement, and began to doubt, that they had put the Marriage of her to arbitrement. But what, thinkes she, if they cast Lots for mee, as for a triuiall and base wager? How, if I shall fall to Archombrotvs ? But when Gelanorvs came with Micipsa to the King, who then was in talke with Argenis , the earnest expectation of the Embassie turned all mens eyes towards him. Hee imbraced them both: and presently Gelanorvs (for the honour was giuen to the Realme of France , that hee should speake before Micipsa ;) Poliarchvs (said hee) the King of France , and (mighty King) neere the Ile of Paconia , and haue sent vs to intreat you, they may, as your friends, enter your Ports, and come both together vnto you. Then Micipsa added further, that Archombrotvs would not haue stood vpon ceremony, or haue asked leaue by an Embassadour, but that the businesse was such, as hee could not land in Sicily , nor come to the King without the company of Poliarchvs . land in what Ports they would within the whole Iland, and himselfe would receiue them on the shore, or meet them, if they pleased, vpon the Sea. Both the Embassadours replyed, Their Kings would take it as a great fauour, if, sparing such paynes in meeting them, hee would be pleased to stay for their comming, in his owne Court. Then (said Meleander ) you shall tell your Kings, I grant them this request; that I may rather seeme to neglect the Office I am bound to, then their commands. I ought to haue met them as farre as Paconia : but since they will haue it so, I will wait for them here. Then said Gelanorvs ; There is one thing more, which I am to desire of you in my Master's behalfe: You your selfe know (Sir) hee hath many Enemies amongst the Sicilians : and therefore hee desireth, that, for his safe- conduct, hee may be suffered to land his Army in Sicily : and hee promiseth vpon his Kingly honour, his Souldiers shall giue no offence. thus renewed; and withall, made a doubt to receiue forreine Forces into his Kingdome, not knowing whether they were friends or foes, the rather, for that he knew Poliarchvs being armed, could be denyed nothing, without bloud and danger. But he saw greater perils hanging ouer his head, if hee, vnprouided for defence, and now doubting how he might trust Argenis , should deny this request to a King so well appoynted; and who sought, perhaps, by this means, to make a quarrell with him. He therefore wisely hid his feare, and to make his humanity shew the more; Wee will also take order, (said hee) for all prouision, Gelanorvs . Neyther shall I thinke my selfe without Souldiers, so long as my Friend (your King) hath an Army in Sicily . He afterwards asked, why Archombrotvs was called King of Sardinia , and of the health of Hyanisbe : and vsed many questions to Gelanorvs touching Poliarchvs his victory, and his wounds; framing himselfe of purpose to mirth, and courtesie. ordinary complement, neyther could he haue priuate accesse to her; though shee with a heauy heart, and doubtfull of her safety, exchanged many sad lookes with him. Then, the time being appoynted, that the fourth day after, if the winde serued, Poliarchvs , and Archombrotvs should come, the Embassadours returned to their Barke, and with all speed make for Paconia .  The preparation for the receyuing of Poliarchvs and Archombrotvs : Their comming to Meleander's Court.  gaue more incouragement to Argenis , then that Poliarchvs had requested to be admitted with the strength of his Army. But the King thought it fit to make no spare eyther of treasure, or other prouision; that if great a King, and, if worse should happen, hee might at least dye magnificently. Hee therefore causes to bee prouided all sorts of meat, not vpon Land onely, but whatsoeuer dainties the Sea afforded. And hee set forth the Court most gloriously, with the most precious and richest of his houshold- stuffe; as Golden and Iuory Beds, Tapistry of seueral colours, and sumptuous Statues of Brasse or Siluer. The Towne was too little to receiue the people, that flocked to Palermo , to see the shew, and the issue of this great businesse: and when they beheld the Court so of purpose adorned in all poynts; as mens dispositions are prone to wantonnesse, knowing no cause why they should now reioyce, or cast off their former feares, they suddenly apply themselues to all sorts of delight. The wealthier sort offered sacrifices in the Temples; and others, taking the inwards of the Beasts which the richer had sacrificed, thought, they gaue thankes to the gods with their playes and dances. Neyther did Meleander hinder the sports of these that would make themselues so merry; for, he made his presages good or bad, and was drawne in this great tumult, eyther to mirth or sadnesse, as his superstition swayed him. The fourth day came, and the two Kings were seene comming vnder sayle. them,  & increased their Fleet. The shore was full of Nobles & comon people; as if the gods had beene comming with all this pompe. But the Admirall Ships did not first enter the Hauen. The Port was distant aboue two miles from the Towne. Gobrias could hardly land a part of the French Army in three houres. They were six thousand armed men: And Micipsa brought along with him about two thousand Mauritanians . They stood in armour, in seuerall Bands, vnder their Colours, as if they were presently to fight a set-battell; sauing, that most of them hauing put off their Helmets, had their heads bare. At last, Poliarchvs landed out of his Royall Ship; and had no sooner trod vpon the shore, but, as if the Genius of the Soyle had inspired him with greater thoughts, hee found himselfe confounded betweene feare and hope of the now neere following successe, almost to the changing of his countenance. But hee stayed for Archombrotvs vpon the Sand of the Seaside, who within an houre-after, landed also in the same place. which they mounted. Poliarchvs had on a Cassocke of his Countrey fashion, of diuers colours, and wore a Mantle almost hid with Iewels. His Chaine of Gold hung vpon his necke, downe by his left side, wherein hee wore his Sword in an Iuory Scabbard, with Buttons of Diamonds. Vpon his armes, that were part bare, hee had Bracelets of refined Gold. His head, that with his long and bright kembed lockes, without any other decking, shewed well enough, hee had bound about with a Garland of Gold-wrought Purple. Aboue all this, the comelinesse of his countenance, and his braue and sweet grace and behauiour made euery motion, euery gesture of his, pleasing. The people therefore, all fixe their eyes vpon him, many applaud him, and those that remembred they had seene him in a priuate habit, now blamed themselues, that they had not euen then apprehended; that the gods bestow no such rare endowments vpon any but Kings. But when Archombrotvs also mounted, being of a presence little inferiour to the other, and bearing his state with equall courage, attyred in the vsuall habit of the Kings of Mauritania , the peoples affections were for a good while wauering and almost diuided; and afterwards their wishes (in signe of good lucke) growing equall, they gaue them a generall and vnanimous applause. So they rode on together, as hauing forgotten all differences; enuironed with their owne and the Sicilian Nobility, a long ranke of Souldiers, and a much greater multitude of people going before them, and almost stopping their passage. All the way from the Port to the City, was couered with the swarme and throng of beholders and attendants. In the City, the windowes were filled with Matrons and Virgins, hauing their children with them, whom they often made merry or afraid, as occasion serued, to make the deeper impression in their memories of this great and glorious sight. The courteous Kings, remembring, that these, who so much honoured them, were not their owne Subiects, fayled not in their salutations, and giuing thankes with their eyes and hands to the people, vntill Meleander appeared at the Court gate. When they perceiued, hee was making towards them on foot, they both lighted. As he was making his excuse, that he had not met them in the Hauen; which hee had not for any pride forborne to doe, but to satisfie their Embassadours that had prescribed him to stay there; both of them modestly forbad him to vse any such needlesse ceremony to young men, and those that had heretofore been his guests. Then gratulating to Poliarchvs his victory, and Sardinia to Archombrotvs ; hee found himselfe grieued, that so great a King of France would suffer himselfe to be reputed in Sicily a man of priuate condition.   downe in Chayres of Estate, and there to discourse together. But they thinking now the time was come of dispatching their businesse, both of them made a stand, and Archombrotvs presenting his Mothers Letters to Meleander , requested him presently to peruse them: for, till then, he might take no rest at all. Poliarchvs made the same request. The King wondring what businesse of such hasty dispatch these Letters might containe, breakes vp the Seale, and begins to reade them. And presently Poliarchvs and Archombrotvs begun to discouer in their lookes euident tokens of disquiet thoughts: for each of them expected from those Letters their certaine fate. If the businesse should fall out otherwise then Hyanisbe had promised; if eyther there should be no meanes offered of friendship betweene them, or but ill conditions; they heartned themselues on to the fight,  & could thinke of nothing but the sword and fury. Archombrotvs also, with the Letters, deliuered Meleander the Cabbinet, (so his Mother had willed him) that Poliarchvs had brought backe from the Pyrates. Neyther had Meleander read much of the Letter, when like a man distraught, hee one while talkes to himselfe, another while casts his eyes vpon Archombrotvs , and then falls to the Letter againe, and to stop at euery Sentence. There was a small key inclosed in the Letter, wherewith the Cabbinet was to be vnlocked, which the King holding fast in his hand, continued reading the Letter Poliarchvs and Archombrotvs now no longer doubted, but these powerful Letters contained matter of very great consequence. At last, Meleander withdrew himselfe to a Table by the next wall, and takes speciall suruey himselfe alone, of what was contained in the Cabbinet he had now opened. Some letters there were, which with sighs and teares he kissed, when he had read them ouer: and a Ring, with some priuate tokens of secret businesse, which made the old man giue beliefe to what So, being surprized with the extremity of passion, he requests Poliarchvs to giue him leaue to go on with some important and secret businesse;  & withal, takes the wondring Archombrotvs more familiarly to the same Table, and shewes him Hyanisbe's Letter, which as he was reading, Meleander falls vpon his neck; and then the young Prince, prostrate at his feet, with change of countenance,  & a far other manner of duty, then such as he had before vsed towards him, much distracted their thoughts that stood about him. But this sight did most of all trouble Poliarchvs : Should hee see his Corriuall taken to imbraces, and entertayned with all the shew of most heartie affection, while he in the meane time stood neglected by Meleander , and left alone to hold discourse with Evrymedes ? For, he, out of good manners, came close to him, while Meleander was in talke with Archombrotvs , that that King might not be vnmannerly left alone in the midst of the roome. As he was swelling with rage for this indignity offered him, there hapned a new cause of fiercer indignation: for, Argenis being told, her Father called for her, enters the roome: and when the King at her comming whispered something in her eare, that none else could heare, and Archombrotvs offered her a kisse, shee most affectionately with both her hands claspes him about the necke. Then both of them shed teares, which by their other lookes and gestures seemed to proceed from their fulnesse of ioy; and she gaue her hand to Archombrotvs at his request, in pledge of a most indissoluble loue. Now had fury ouercome Poliarchvs his patience, and hee was in minde to disturbe this new ioy of theirs, that so much vexed him. Not knowing whom he should most curse, Hyanisbe, Meleander , or Archombrotvs , he was much more incensed against Argenis , on whom he resolued to be reuenged, at least wise by killing himselfe: and, as thought, especially angry thought, is euer swifter then speech, he had in a short time many and cruell cogitations: Hath Hyanisbe then, after her preseruation by the wounds of mee and my subiects, thus rewarded mee? I, vnprouident man, exposed my selfe to her poysons, and accepted of her Physicions in my sicknesse: but shee would not haue me dye, till I first found my selfe slighted and scorned to my face, and see Argenis not onely giuen away from mee, but so farre bewitched, as to hang vpon her Sonnes necke. Hast thou sent mee, thou Witch, to so bitter an end? Are these your Letters, these your promises, these your vowes made in the hearing of your houshold gods? Oh foole that I was, to hope for truth in Africa ! But you shall not scape without reuenge for your treachery. I will haue warre with thee, I will (by Hercules ) haue warre to the vtter ruine of thy whole Nation. Why doe I thus stand musing, like a foole? and, as if I had a minde to liue, cherish my selfe with hope of future comforts? Seest thou not some here before thee, who, it is fit, should dye, and thy selfe with them? I will goe and take that hang-mans breathe from him, that hauing obtayned the Crowne of Sardinia by my conquest, makes now no question but to fore-stall mee in my marriage; and I will make the shamelesse Argenis looke redde at least, and blush with his bloud: Then will I cut in pieces this mischieuous old man, this Goblin, this Ghost, before any can come to his rescue: and for Argenis her selfe; Argenis , I say---. (Here, wretched man, hee stopped in his cruell resolution.) But what will it auayle mee to let a poore Maid bloud? She will fitlier dye with the memory of her owne falshood, and my wound. I will rip vp mine owne heart; and when the bloud shall gush out, cast my selfe vpon her, like a Fury, to affright her: for, if I were not resolued so to dye, I could raise my owne Souldiers, I could with mine owne safety, plucke downe these buildings vpon my enemies heads. But I will not liue, for feare to be reconciled to Argenis . He had no leisure to cast in his minde those and such like desperate conceits, while their first mutuall louing entertainment made Meleander, Archombrotvs , and Argenis , forget all other businesse: and being thus headstrong and resolute in his purpose, had his hand vpon his Swords hilt, when the gods would not suffer so good a man to be guilty of so foule a crime: Euen at that very instant, Meleander , nothing knowing of all this rage of his, and comming to him; Pardon vs, said hee, deare Guest, for that wee haue beene stayed from giuing you fit entertainement, by an vnexpected gladnesse, which peraduenture will be no lesse pleasing to you, then euen now you perceiued it to be to mee and Argenis . Come, dearest of mortall men, partner of our happinesse, and see what this day hath deserued of you. affections doubtfull what to expect or thinke, refused not to goe with then Meleander , not now with so low a voyce, but that the Souldiers by, might heare, Oh, fruitfull day, quoth hee, oh day propitious to these yeeres of mine, who heretofore content to solace my selfe with one onely Daughter, am now blessed with two, two such children! Let not the gods enuy mee. What mortall is now happier then my selfe am? or, who should make more account of the poore remainder of life that is left him? Did then the Fates, through so many crosses, and threatning dangers, prepare mee these aydes and ornaments of my Kingdome? Cease, dearest Guest, greatest of Kings,  & (which is more then all) Poliarchvs , to be angry with Archombrotvs . It is long since I perceiued you were at difference. Both of you loued Argenis , and both of you shall enioy her: for, he, whom I haue begotten, shall loue her as a Sister: and to you, if you be not otherwise disposed, I giue her for your wife: for, though by finding a Brother, shee hath lost the Inheritance of Sicily ; yet neuerthelesse, if I be not deceyued in you, you will loue her, and shee shall be a Queene: for Sardinia , and whatsoeuer belonged to Dower. Thus hath my Sonne agreed with mee: and now, Archombrotvs , doe you first renounce all hatred, and giue your Sister to King Poliarchvs . Who would haue thought so much? Archombrotvs labouring the Match, and offering his Sisters hand, inuites Poliarchvs to the marriage of happinesse. And Argenis blushed; she, that while the warres, and her Father crossed her; she, that not long was so bold, so almost rebellious against her Father, and would follow Poliarchvs wheresoeuer he listed, now remembred she was a Virgin. Poliarchvs all at once giues his hand to vsuall in great and sudden chances, they all talked confusedly; all without order, all together. The young Princes renewed their old friendship, which they had begun at Timoclea's house. The old King, and the young Lady had got fresh spirit: and the chearefulnesse of the young Kings spred it selfe amongst all the beholders. The Noblemen stood mute for a time, and afterwards filled the whole Court with variety of discourse. And many preased in, to heare the newes. Neyther was Meleander displeased with this concourse of people: for, it concerned him to haue so great and publique businesse generally knowne. And therefore with a cleare voyce, as if the old mans ioy had giuen him stregth; My good subiects and Guests, said he, whom this Day hath drawne into a most sacred vnity and friendship; go all, gratulate your Kings, and spend the rest of the Day in holy exercises. I would haue you all to morrowe to come to the Court Gate. There shall both the people and the Souldiers be assembled, that none may be ignorant of the blessings of the gods, which, I think, they haue more abundantly bestowed vpon mee, then vpon any other: Yet I thinke it fit you should in few words vnderstand the cause of my so exceeding gladnesse. I haue found out, that Archombrotvs is my owne sonne: my Wife was deliuered of him, vnknowne to me: and my Daughter shall be marryed to King Poliarchvs . Goe merrily home, and make this happy day, if you please, the Vigill to the morrowes ioy. I, in the meane time, with my Sonne-in-law, and Sonne, will dispose of our affaires, as we shall thinke fit.  Great ioy amongst the Sicilians, French , and Africanes . Meleander calleth together the people, and causeth the Letter of Hyanisbe to be read in publique.  priuat Lodging, intending to solace himselfe that night with the sweet society of his dearest friends. What wishes had each of them then? What thoughts? The most chaste Argenis enioyed the fruit of her constancy, and had wonne so much by her many griefes, that none could seeme worthier of her great fortune, then her selfe. Poliarchvs , now forgetting all emulation and grudge, tooke pleasure, when his Father-in-law iested vpon him, for the kisses that Sonne-in-law; and sometimes calling Poliarchvs, Theocrine . And true knowledge of him; whether it were, that she had him her brother, or should not haue him for her Husband? Amongst these iests, their mirth hardly gaue them leisure for businesses. Aneroestvs himselfe laid aside his austerity, and presumed to be merry; and though in course attyre, yet he was vsed royally, as a King, both by Meleander and Argenis . There were but few of their most priuate friends admitted to this cheareful recreation. And yet Aneroestvs, Ibvrranes , and Dvnalbivs supped with the Kings: and Gelanorvs, Arsidas, & Gobrias were present, with Micipsa the Mauritanian , and Cleobvlvs & Evrymedes. Nicopompvs was twice sent for by the King, but stayed somewhat too long: for he had retyred himselfe to make the Epithalamion . Timoclea only, of all the Ladies, attended on their chiefe discourse was of Poliarchvs ; how heartily he had loued; how forgetting his owne estate, he had thrust himselfe into dangers, vnknowne, carelesse of himselfe, and farre from safety, eyther from Fortune, or his enemies hatred. From whence should this ardour arise? or what ground had he to build so costant a loue vpon? Then did he relate to those willing hearers, how he had heard a large report of the beauty  & vertue of Argenis , in France : hence grew an earnest desire in his youthfull hart, which the admiratio of her rare perfections, or (to speak more truly) the Fates augmented;  & when he knew that the Sicilian Lawes forbad my marriage with the French , that barre did so much the more enflame him: and thereupon pretending a deuotion to the gods of forreine Nations, and vnder colour to visit their Temples, he came priuately with Gelanorvs into Sicily ; that he might be an eye-witnesse, whether the beauty of Argenis were answerable to the report that went of her, and worthy of the warre he intended to make against those Lawes of Sicily , if he could win her affection, as he hoped in time to doe, and nothing but those Lawes hindered his happinesse. But when hee was come into Sicily , he could not so much as haue a sight of the Lady, who being shut vp in a strong Castle, it was not lawfull for any man to see her. Then hee resolued to put himselfe vpon that happy hazard, to come in a Virgins habit, to beguile Selenissa , and to be called Theocrine. Meleander helped him out with the rest of the story, often remembring between mirth and admiration, how in all poynts like a Maid he came, with what a mournfull tale he had moued him to compassion, and so made himselfe way to Argenis ; and after, with what exceeding courage and strength he had quelled the Villaines, that were entred the Castle; and of Theocrine , became Pallas . Then they turned their discourse from Poliarchvs to Archombrotvs ,  & wondred at many passages concerning him. Was he then the true Prince of Sicily , and had so loued Meleander , not knowing whom he honoured? How long Hyanisbe had concealed this!  & in how seasonable a time discouered it! How the gods had brought all this to passe, not much vnlike the pleasure of a deuised Fable in a Comedy! Then Meleander discoursed his marriage in Africa , and, as farre as the present mirth gaue leaue, bewayled his dead wife; and so by often telling all this story, with his seuerall aduentures, he seemed to digest the speech he was the next day to make in publique. The night was farre spent, when they rose from Supper. When it was neere Sunne-rising, all that were in Palermo flocked with Garlands of greene boughs on their heads, to the Court. The Court-yards were not able to containe the multitude. Some got vp vpon the walls, and some filled the Scaffolds that were set vp on purpose. Others brought Ladders, many of which breaking with their too heauy burden, fell vpon those that were vnder them. At the Palace Gate was a little Scaffold built, almost to a mans height. There were the Chayres of State set for the Kings; two of equall height, where Poliarchvs and Meleander sate; and two somewhat lower towards the side of the Scaffold for Archombrotvs and Argenis . When the Princes were seated, and the Herald had proclaimed silence, (my good Guests and Subiects) with any disastrous businesse, I had need to vse Art and Eloquence to mitigate the danger, and cheare vp your hearts. But, as it is, what need I with vain flourishes of speech to set forth the benefit of the gods, which they haue so bountifully bestowed vpon vs? I bring you ioyful tydings, of peace and amity with our confederate Kings and Nations; and terrour, war, and desolation to our Enemies. Nor doe I thinke, but you know, what I am about to speake. Some god, no doubt, and Fame her selfe, if she hath any Deity, hath giuen you notice, that this day is to be the day of my daughters marriage with King Poliarchvs ; and, as it were, the new birth- day of my Sonne; (and with that he turned his looke towards Archombrotvs , that was rising to him:) who, why hee hath continued so long vnknowne to mee, and how I haue now found him to be my sonne; it is very fit (my louing Subiects) you all should know. Here, Herald, take the Queene of Mauritania's Letter, and reade it openly, as loud as thy voyce will serue thee. Then the Herald read the Letter, to this purpose:  Queene Hyanisbe to King Meleander , health. haue not thought good till this day, to make you a sharer in that exceeding ioy, which now, to your wonder, I shall impart vnto you: for, I hold it your fault, that you would neyther acquaint me with your marriage with my sister by her: yet I did so much honour your vertue, that I would not deliuer you your owne Sonne, till I had first made triall, whether he would grow worthy of so great a Father: But now finding his worth answerable to his birth, I thought fit to discouer what I kept so long concealed. When you at you departure towards Sicily , left my Sister Anna here, whom you had not long before secretly married, and the time was expired, wherein shee had by many deuices sought to couer her great belly, at last shee fell exceeding sicke. Wee, mistaking her disease, gaue her vnprofitable physicke: But shee finding her end to draw on, thus spake to mee in priuate: Pardon mee, deare Sister, since I haue not otherwise offended, but in my silence: I am Wife to paynes are such, as I feare mee, I cannot escape death: If my Childe liue, deare Sister, I leaue it to your choyce, whether you will keepe it, or send it to the Father: yet would I haue this kept secret, that the people may not know I was a Mother, before I was a Wife. But wee had seuerall reasons to keepe our marriage priuate; both, because wee stood in feare, that Cirthvs the Numidian , my vnwelcome Suitor, would vse some violence: and for that home: and lastly, in respect of my shamefastnesse, which I am afraid (miserable woman!) I doe now violate, euen with the telling you this Story. See (Sister) heere on my Pillow lye the conditions of our Marriage vnder withall shee deliuered mee the writing.) But in this Boxe are certaine priuate notes of our secret contract, as Letters, Rings, and a Bracelet made of both our hayre. When you shall shew him these, hee will know, I haue imparted vnto you the truth of all passages betweene vs. At these words, her speech fayled her: I comforted her, after a little recouery of strength, calling some of her most trusty women to her, and we all tooke care for things needfull for her. But her throwes exceeded all our helpe: yet was shee deliuered of a Sonne, which wee held to her, while she was yet liuing: and then I asked of her, if shee could endure to write some few words; I know not what god putting mee in minde to haue her doe that, which is now so auayleable to our present businesse. Shee did so at my request, and writ, that shee was then dying, and left your Sonne to my education. You will know her hand (excellent King) though through weakenesse and trembling shee could not well guide her Pen, nor draw her Letters right. Not long after, shee dyed in my armes. There were onely foure Women with mee. I deliuered the Infant to one Sophoneme , one whom I especially trusted, with charge to take care of him, and found him out a Nurse, that did not know whose Childe she was to keepe. And fearing left any of these foure should proue blabs. I afterwards deceiued them also, by the help of the same Sophoneme , making them beleeue the Boy was dead. About the same time my Brother Ivba dyed, and left me his Kingdome: and my Husband Syphax , as if the Fates had conspired against vs, ended his life. Beeing thus full of griefe, yet I neither forgot you, Meleander , nor my Sister. I counterfeited my selfe with child, and with the same Sophoneme's helpe, gaue out, that I was deliuered of a Sonne, after my husbands death. But I could not then shew your Sonne, as my owne: for the child was too big to be new borne. But Sophoneme supplyed his roome with another new-borne babe, which afterwards shee, by my appointment, put to nurse. I, making shew to feare, the Child might bee bewitched, gaue charge, that none but the Nurses and Sophoneme alone, should be suffered to see my Sonne. And then after two yeeres, it was easie to shew your Hyempsal (for so his dying mother named him, after his Grandfathers name) for my owne Sonne. And euer since, I haue kept my selfe a widdow for his sake, and meane to leaue him my Kingdome. None of our neighbour Kings could with any suite draw me to marriage. When hee was three and twenty yeeres old, I made report to him of your vertues, and aduised him to trauell into Sicily , to see the manner of your gouernment, and learne to rule by your example. And that hee might compasse this with more ease, if he would goe as a priuate man, and not bee knowne that I was his Mother; lest your fauour, and the flattery of others, might carry him quite away from that fresh and reall vertue, which being often denyed to Princes, ennobles the actions and estates of meaner men. He, in obedience to my command, went thither: and it is wonderfull that he should winne so much vpon your affection, that you, being so great a King, should offer to bestow on him your Daughter, borne of your last wife, hauing (as you thought) no more children. When hee had written this newes to me, though I was glad of his vertue and your nature, which drew you to loue your yet vnknowne Sonne; yet I trembled with the feare of the mention of such an incestuous marriage, lest the Brother should marry his owne Sister. And I was frighted also with other dangers; for Radirobanes was comming to the spoyle of Africa with his Army. I therefore wrote to our Hyempsal , whom you call Archombrotvs , to put off the marriage, which I heare, is concluded betweene you; and to request him to make all speede with his Nauy to my succour. But his helpe had come too late, neither had hee found whom hee should haue relieued, if the storme had not cast King Poliarchvs with his French Forces vpon our Coast. By his valor are the spoyles of Radirobanes now in our Temple of Mars . But we were like to haue had more fatall differences in peace, than in warre; through the bitter emulation of Poliarchvs and Archombrotvs . Your Argenis was the cause of their hatred, whose marriage both of them seeke, beyond the common desire of men. I, finding your Sonnes fury and mistaking, preuailed with them both to bridle their rage, and abstaine from fight, till they had deliuered you this Letter, and instantly each of them should bee master of his wishes: which will so come to passe, if you be pleased to acknowledge your Sonne, and giue your Daughter to wife to King gods in noble atchieuements, and heroicall vertues. I giue you full power to make her a Dower either out of your estate or mine: Sicily, Mauritania , and the late-conquered Sardinia , will be enough, both for your Sonne to raigne in plenty, and to bestow your daughter according to her birth and estate. I send you in this Cabinet, whatsoeuer secret my Sister left me on her death-bed; and amongst the rest, her last letter, wherein shee giues you to vnderstand, that she had a Sonne of yours come into the world, when she left it. All which were once lately lost: for (O mischiefe!) the Pirates had robbed mee of the Cabinet. But King Poliarchvs slew the Theeues, and brought it mee backe vntouched. So, you are in part indebted to him for your Sonne; and I for my Kingdome, whereto I haue long agoe designed your Hyempsal for my successor. No reward, but Argenis , can be sufficient for these his many merits. Farewell; and cheere vp your old age with these blessings bestowed vpon you by the gods.  The hoarse Herald could scarcely reade ouer this long Letter. After the reading of it, followed a confused noyse among the people. Many had heard it; and they which stood further off, troubled those that vnderstood it, with multiplicity of questions. The Letter also seemed very darke to many of them; which Meleander thinking before-hand it would so fall out, began to explane the Letter with another speech of his owne. Hee rehearsed the whole story of his youth; how at his Fathers command, he had heretofore married the Daughter of the Prince of the Brutians , who continuing his wife sixe yeeres without issue, dyed of a hurt she tooke by a fall from her horse, as shee was hunting, against a stubbe of a tree. He was then thirty fiue yeeres old, his Father still liuing. At the same time raigned in Mauritania , Ivba , a Confederate with Sicily , to whom hee trauelled with a small traine, to driue away the griefe hee had for the death of his wife. Then hee told them, how King Ivba had two Sisters; the ealder of them, Hyanisbe , married to Syphax , a man there of great power and estate: the yonger called great power, that Ivba , though hee liked him not, feared to offend him. How hee himselfe in the mean time fell in loue with the Lady Anna , who hating the Numidian , cast her affection vpon him. So they were married priuately; and he, by her aduice, returned home, to gather forces out of Sicily , to oppose the Numidian , if hee should offer any open violence; and there was stayed by his Fathers Funerall, that he could not returne, at the time he promised, into Africa . In this interim he had newes brought him of the death of the Lady Anna ; and so, no more minding Mauritania , he afterwards married a Sicilian Lady, his Vncles Daughter, by whom he had and how the Lady Anna was deliuered of this my Sonne. Shee hath heere sent me many infallible tokens of the truth, in a Cabinet locked and sealed vp; all which I well know, by the remembrance of fore-passed accidents.  his prediction of happines to them all.  you, most mighty King, whose gift it is, that we liue and raigne? You freed both mee and Argenis from slauery, when the villaines sent by Souldiers to victory; and you alone vanquished my enemies. Afterwards, you left Sicily , to my hurt, and, how-euer you would excuse it, to my shame. Neither could our iniuries ouercome your goodnesse. You were wronged, and yet still loued tokens, whereby I haue come to the knowledge of my Sonne, and he of his father, amongst the Pirates, and by your valour redeemed them? And in Africa , what a hard and glorious worke to keep Radirobanes from Conquest, the losse of your blood, which still appeareth by the palenesse of your face, well declares. Would you could loue a name, that might shew mee to be inferiour to you. But you had rather haue me called your Father-in-law. Oh happy of that cowardly policy of our Ancestors, who did so much feare the greatnesse of the French , that they straitly forbade our Sicilian Princes to marry with you; as if so great and powerfull alliance were to bee held as a seruitude. You haue deserued, that we should all with one consent abrogate this Law. But the gods haue so dealt with vs, as wee haue no need to breake this Ordinance: For, they haue restored mee my Sonne, to succeed me in Sicily ; and my Argenis shall not bee of meaner estate; for she shall haue Sardinia and Liguria , and vnite them to your France , without breach of our Lawes. Heere Archombrotvs , as it was agreed, asked leaue of his Father to speake; and presently begun to Poliarchvs in this manner: The possession of Sardinia , which I enioy, what is it else, but the fruit of your victory? You conquered it in Africa ; I came onely to the Triumph. You therefore, dearest Sister; you, for louing of whom, Poliarchvs himselfe doth now pardon me, receiue heere this Crowne, and in liew of Sicily , whereto my birth-right hath intitled mee, be you Queene of all the dominions which were vnder Radirobanes . You shall bring that to your Husband, which hee, in right of his victory, might haue taken as his owne. And withall, he puts the Crowne vp, on his Sisters head; Meleander weeping for ioy, and the people applauding it with so many and lowd acclamations, that for a long time their eares lost their office. Poliarchvs , as he was exceedingly eloquent, cloquent, extenuated so the memory of his merits, as indeed he did cunningly set them forth to the most; with such reuerence to people, that it was questionable, whether hee were the brauer Warriour or Courtiet. And now, as they were all setting forward to the Temple, Nicopompvs his Sonne, that was little aboue tenne yeeres old, was brought by his Father to Father, and in a bold and iesting manner, affirmed himselfe to bee the Author of it. And when Meleander called him to him, and willed him to giue him and Poliarchvs copies, of it; the Boy did so, hauing some ready written in his hand. They continuing to question him, whose worke the Verses were, forced him often to smile at the telling of his lye. There were but a few lines, as to Princes that were now busied, and so they found the more Readers.  To grace this Marriage from the starry Skie, We, that are Poets. Lo, from th' opened Skie, The gods long traine descends to Sicily . Whil'st Hymen lights his Torch, whil'st heaun's great Queene Adornes the Bridall pompe, and Cvpid's seene To deale his gentle wounds, and misses not; Behold, faire Phoebvs his crown'd Harp had got, To which his rosie lips 'gan tune this note: Ioyne in a lasting league your louing hands, Which Time shall not dissolue, nor Fates withstand; Ioyne, Princes; On you smile these golden dayes; And let the fiue-fold bridall Tapers shine, Whil'st the French gods with the Sicilian ioyne. Blest Father-in-law! blest paire! blest Progenie! Behold the Virgins face, long promis'd thee; Such are Minerva's cheekes; such are the faire Like Cynthia , when her hunting Robes she leaues, And her the Skie in brightest lookes receiues, Is thy faire Bride. The gods benignity, Great King, behold; but with a neerer eye, Suruey her beautious mind: Thou'lt thinke her heart Not mortall; and that thou in heauen art. As much, thy lookes, and golden lockes to see, Thy chaste flame-sparkling eyes, reioyces shee. Sometimes her louing heart fancies thee, so As thou to warre in dreadfull Armes dost goe; Sometimes thy lookes, when forth at thy returne Thy Subiects flocke; when in like triumph borne, Her selfe shall Gallia's longing Cities view. Sometimes she thinkes she dreames; Too good for true Is what she sees, and fading when she wakes. Ah, feare not, Princely Maid; No slumber makes This ioy, nor are thy longing thoughts deluded. 'Tis true; the gods with me haue all concluded. Thus with one heart and voyce they all command; Ioyne in a lasting league your louing hands; Oh, ioyne your hands, thou, of all Maids most bright; Thou, amongst men, such, as in cleerest night, Bright Lvcifer does other Starres excell. But come thou, sacred Peace, at length, and dwell With these deseruing brests; Enough haue they Endur'd of danger, and enough delay. Now make these Princes in each other blest, And of their long-desired ioyes possest. Not great Alcides entred heauen, before That he the sweat of his twelue labours wore. Your louing hands conioynt for aye in one; Oh, ioyne your hands. All Clouds and stormes are gone. A gentler Ayre now shines; no day shall lowre; And all the gods on you their gifts shall powre. Though in sad stormes great Heroes fortunes euer Begin; yet Vertue suffers shipwracke neuer. The Sacrifices were prepared at the Temple of Ivno Lucina ; and the Augures , and the High-priests, in order ready to beginne their deuotions for the prosperous successe of the marriage. The people sung Hymnes to Mother, to carry the Torch before her at her marriage; that Honour, vpon the commendation of Poliarchvs and Archombrotvs , was conferred vpon guardians of the fires that were borne before Argenis , who was couered with a veyle; when now the Sacrifices being ready to be slaine, Poliarchvs , more maiestically than before, by reason of this dayes ioy, commands the Sacrificers to stay their hands, and thus speakes to Archombrotvs : If you will beleeue me, Brother, it grieues me, that now when I am married, you should be to seeke a wife. I haue a Sister, whose beauty and naturall endowments would much commend one of meaner estate; about twenty yeeres of age. To make our friendship the stronger, I will, if you please, giue her to you in marriage. And because, by the Law of our Countrey, no part of the Kingdome can descend vpon a Daughter, her Dower shall bee six hundred Talents in present money. Meleander was present at this proposition, who, when (for this alliance pleased him well) but as leauing this choyse of his wife to his Father, asked him, If hee would accept the Lady vpon these conditions. And kept silence, to moue her brother to this marriage. Hee, with open and cheerefull countenance, answered, that he gladly accepted this offer, and embracing Poliarchvs ; You haue, said he, most puissant King, preuented my wishes. What god hath reuealed to you the secrets of my heart? let me then also be espowsed to the absent Lady, euen with these Rites. You, my dearest Brother, shall engage your faith for vs both. The Priests were willed to double the Ceremonies; which they did, making a great coyle about the Temple with their speed and diligence. And when the news was bruited among the people, the ayre being fill'd with the fresh shouts and acclamations of the applauding Multitude; some few Birds that flew ouer them, losing the helpe of their wings, fell downe dead amongst them. All men reioyced: all men runne vp and downe, as if their ioy had lost them their wits: and in this confused multitude, their excesse of mirth made them forget all difference of persons. In the meane time they offered, what they had cut out of the inwards of the Sacrifices, to the gods: and when the Augures told them, all happinesse was portended by the Oblations, one of which had a liuer made like a garland; the Incense being kindled, the Princes that were to be married, approached to the Altar. After the Rites ended, the whole Trayne was returning to the Court, when in the Porch of the Temple, Aneroestvs meetes them at their comming forth, with a pale countenance, full of Prophetique fury: for the gods had possessed his deseruing brest. So, shaking his reuerend head with a diuine rage; Haile, said hee,  oh Kings: Oh the speciall care of the gods; heretofore vsed to crosses and afflictions, but now comming to find by experience, that nothing brings more perfect felicity, than vertue. Ah, happiest old man! doe not vpbraid the gods, Meleander , for spending of your time in warre, and the rebellion of your Subiects: You shall yet enioy many yeers of a strong and healthfull life, and neither feare forraigne nor domesticke violence. You shall sometimes visite Hyanisbe in Africa , and sometimes entertaine her in Sicily . All faction and Treason shall bee farre from your Raigne. Your age, and Archombrotvs his youth, shall strike reuerence and terrour into all Nations. You, happy Father, shall see him returning with victory and triumph from your neighbouring Brutians, Lucanes , and Epeircians : and his children shall grow to yeeres in your imbraces, and leaue a long succession of Princes to the Crowne of Sicily . Neither is your Daughter dearer vnto you, that now must depart for France , then your Daughter-in-law shall bee, that is to come from thence. But you, Iewels of this age; you, rewards, that are most certainely laid vp in store for your constancy and vertue. Many things I know not: many things I must not speake. The Fates themselues keepe some part of the happinesse to which you are borne, concealed euen from the gods, left they should enuy you. Yet take thus much from mee: That loue, which hath this day ioyned you together, shall hold inuiolate to the end. No difference, no loathing, no iealousie shall lessen it. The Rhine on the one side, and the Ocean on the other, shall behold you Conquerours. The Statues of Timandra sporting amongst her Nephewes, shall be mistaken, by the happy errour of our Posterity, for Cybele , the Mother of the gods. The neighbour-Nations shall admire your glory and power; and not refuse to bee conquered, to bee gouerned by you. Wheresoeuer you go, Safety her selfe shall attend you: whatsoeuer you desire, the gods shall preuent your wishes. And, that your felicity leaue you not euen in death, one night shall (after a long and happy age) cloze vp both your eyes together, and send you to increase the number of the Starres. Nor doubt ye of your fame: That shall be made eternall by the Genius of your History, which hereafter shall be spred abroad among all Nations; and no force, no time be able to extinguish it.
