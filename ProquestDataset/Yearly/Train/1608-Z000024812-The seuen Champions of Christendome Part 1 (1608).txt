 By wearie pen, and painefull Authors toyle: Enrold we finde such feates of Chiualrie, As hath beene seldome seene in any soyle. Thy ensignes here wee finde in field displaide, The Trophies of thy victories erected: Such deedes of Armes, as none could haue assaide, But Knights, whose courage feare hath not detected. Such Ladies sau'd, such monsters made to fall, Such Gyants slaine, such hellish Furies queld: That humane forces, few or none at all, In such exploits, their liues could safely shield. But vertue stirring vp their noble minds, By valiant conquests to enlarge their fames, Hath caused them seeke aduentures forth to find, Which registreth their neuer dying names. Then Fortune, Time, and Fame agree in this, That honours gaine the greatest glory is. Of the wonderfull and strange birth of Saint George of England: how hee was cut out of his Mothers wombe, and after stolen from his Nurses by Kalyb the Lady of the woods: Her loue to him, and her gifts: and how he inclosed her in a Rocke of stone, and redeemed sixe Christian Knights out of prison, After the angrie Greekes had ruinated the cheife Cittie in Phrigia , and turned King Priamus glorious buildings to a waste and desolate wildernes, Duke Aenaeas exempted from his natiue habitation, with many of his distressed Countrimen (like Pilgrims) wandered the world to finde some happie Region, where they might erect the Image of their late subuerted Troy : but before that labor could be accomplished, Aenaeas ended his daies in the confines of Italie , and left his sonne Askanius to gouerne in his stead: Askanius dying, left Siluius to rule: Siluius deceasing, left the noble and aduenturous Brutus : which Brute (being the fourth discent from Aenaeas :) First made conquest of this land of Brittaine , then inhabited with Monsters, Gyants, and a kinde of wilde people without gouernment, but by pollicie hee ouercame them, and established good and ciuill lawes: where hee layd the first foundation of new Troy , and named it Troynouant , but since by processe of time, called London : then began the Ile of Britaine to flourish, not onely with sumptuous buildings, but with valiant and couragious Knights, whose aduenturous and bold attempts in Chiualrie, Fame shall describe what obliuion buried in obscuritie. After this the land was plentified with Citties, & deuided into Shires and Counties: Dukedomes, Earle domes, and Lordships was the patrimony for high and noble mindes: wherein they liued not then like fearefull cowards in their Mothers bosome, but merited renowne by martiall discipline: For the famous Cittie of Couentrie was the place wherein the first Christian Champion of England was borne, and the first that euer sought for forraine aduentures, whose name to this day all Europe highly hath in regard, and for his bold and magnanimious deeds at armes gaue him this title, The valiant Knight Saint George of England , whose golden Garter is not onely worne by Nobles, but by Kings: and in memorie of his victories, all England fights euermore vnder his Banner. Therefore Caliope , thou sacred sister of the Muses, guide so my pen, that it may write the true discourse of this worthy Champion. When nature by true consanguinitie had created him in his mothers wombe, shee dreamed to be conceaued of a dragon, which should be the cause of her death: which dreame long shee concealed and kept secret, vntill her painfull burthen grew so heauie, that her wombe was scarce able to indure it, so finding oportunitie to reueale it to her Lord & husband, being then the Lord high steward of England , repeated her dreame after this maner. My Honourable Lord, you knowe I am by birth the King of Englands daughter, and for these one and twenty yeares haue beene your true & lawfull wife, yet neuer was in any hope of child till now, or that by me your name should suruiue: Therefore I coniure you by the pleasures of your youth, and the deare and naturall loue you beare to the Infant conceaued in my wombe, that eyther by Arte, wisdome, or some celestiall inspiration, you calculate vpon my troublesome dreames, and tell what they signifie. For these 30. nights past, my silent slumbers haue beene greatly hindered by a greiuous dreame, for night by night no sooner could sweete sleepe take possession of my sences, but me thought I was conceaued with a dreadfull Dragon, which shoulde bee the cause of his Parentes deaths: euen as heauenly Hecuba the beautious Queene of Troy , when Paris was in her wombe, dreamed to bee conceaued with a firebrand, which indeede was truly verified: for Paris hauing rauished the Parragon of Greece , and brought Helena into Troy , in reuenge thereof the Grecians turned the Towers of Illium into a blaze of fire. Therefore, most deare and welbeloued Lord, preuent the like daunger, that I be not the mother of a viperous Sonne. These words strooke such a terrour to his heart, that for a time hee stood speechles, but hauing recouered his lost sences, answered her in this maner: My most deare and beloued Lady, what Arte or Learning can performe, with all conuenient speede shall be accomplished, for neuer shall rest take possession in my heart, nor sleepe close vp the closets of mine eyes, till I vnderstand the signification of thy troublesome dreames. So leauing her in her Chamber, in company of other Ladies that came to comfort her in her melancholy sadnes, tooke his iourny to the solitary walks of Kalyb the wise Ladie of the woods, without any company except another knight, that bore vnder his arme a milke white Lambe, which they intended to offer to the Inchantres. So trauayling for the space of two dayes, they came to a thicket beset about with old withered and hollow trees, wherein they were entertayned with such a dismal croaking of night Rauens, hissing of Serpents, bellowing of Bulles, and roring of monsters, that it rather seemed a wildernesse of furies, then any worldly habitation: by which they knew it to be the inchanted vale of Kalyb the Ladie of the woods. So pacing to the middle of the thicket, they came to a Caue, whose gate and entry was of Iron, whereon hung a mightie brazen horne for them to winde that would speake with the Sorceresse, first offering their Lambe with great humilitie before the posterne of the Caue: then exempting all feare, they winded the brazen horne, the sound whereof seemed to shake the foundation of the earth: after which they heard a loud and hollow voyce that vttered these words following: Sir Knight, from whence thou camst, returne, Thou hast a Sonne most strangely borne: A Dragon fell shall split in twaine, Thy Ladies wombe with extreame paine: A Champion bold from thence shall spring, And practize many a wondrous thing: Returne therefore, make no delay, For it is true what I doe say. This darke Riddle, or rather mysticall Oracle, being thrice repeated in this order, so much amazed them, that they stood in doubt whether it were best to returne, or to wind the brazen horne the second time: but being perswaded by the other knight not to moue the impatiece of Kalyb , he rested satisfied with that answere. Thus he left the inchaunted Caue to the gouerment of Kalyb , and with all speede dispatched his iourney to his natiue habitation: but in the meane time his Ladie beeing ouercharged with extreame paine and bitter anguish of her laborsome wombe, was forced eyther to the spoyle of her Infant, or decay of her owne life: But regarding more the benefite of her Countrey, then her owne safety, and for the preseruation of her childe, shee most willingly committed her tender wombe to be opened. that her infant might be taken forth aliue. Thus with the consent of many learned Chirurgions, this most noble & magnanimious Ladie was cast into a dead sleepe, her wombe cut vp with sharpe razers, and the Infant taken from the bed of his creation. Upon his brest nature had picturde the liuely forme of a Dragon, vppon his right hand a bloody Crosse, and on his left leg a golden garter, they named him George , and prouided him three nurses, one to giue him sucke, another to keepe him asleepe, and the third to prouide him foode. Not many dayes after his natiuitie, the fell Inchantresse Kalyb , being the vtter enemie to true Nobilitie, by charmes and witchcrafts stole the Infant from his carelesse nurses: At which time (though all too late) her Noble Lord and husband returned, in good hope to heare a ioyfull deliuerie of his Ladie, and a comfort of a sonne: but his wished ioy, was turned into a lasting sorrow, for hee found not onely his Lady dismembred of her wombe, but his young Sonne wanting, without any newes of his abode, which wofull spectacle bereaued him of his wits, that for a time hee stood senselesse, like weeping Niobe , but at last brake into these bitter exclamations. O heauens! why couer you not earth, with euerlasting night? or why doe these accursed eyes behold the Sunne? O that the woes of Oedipus might end my dayes, or like an exile, ioy in banishment, where I may warble forth my sorrowes to the whispering woods, that sencelesse trees may record my losse, and vntamed beastes greiue at my want. What monster hath bereaued me of my child? or what Tyrant hath beene glutted with his Tragedie? O that the wind would be a messenger, and bring me happie newes of his abode: if hee bee drenched in the deepest Seas, thither will I diue to fetch him vp: if hee bee hidden in the cauerns of the earth, thither will I digge to see my Sonne: or if hee, like a feathered foule, lie houering in the ayre, yet thither will I flie, and embrace him that neuer yet my eyes beholde. But why doe I thunder foorth my exclamations thus in vaine, when neither heaue, nor earth, nor seas, nor any thing in heauen, in earth, nor seas will lend me cofort for his recouerie? Thus complained hee many moneths for the losse of his sonne, & sent Messengers into euery circuite of the Land, but no man proued so fortunate, as to returne him happie tydings. Hee then being frustrate of all good hopes, stored himselfe with iewels, and so intended to trauell the wide world, either to speed in his iourney, or to leaue his bones in some forraine region. Thus leauing his natiue Countrie, wandred from place to place, till the hayres of his head were growne as white as siluer, and his beard like to the thistle downe, but at last he ended his trauell in Bohemia , where, what for age and excessiue griefe, he layd himselfe downe vnder a ruinate Monasterie wall and dyed: the Commons of that Countrie hauing knowledge of his name (by a Iewel he wore in his bosome) ingraued it in Marble stone right ouer his sepulchre, where we leaue him sleeping in peace, and returne to his sonne remayning with Kalyb the Lady of the woods in the inchanted Caue. Now twice seuen yeeres were fully finished, since Kalyb first had in keeping the noble Knight Saint George of England, whose minde many times thirsted after honorable aduentures, and often attempted to set himselfe at libertie, but the fell Inchantresse tendring him as the apple of her eye, appointed twelue sturdie Satyres to attend his person, so that neither force nor pollicie could further his intent: shee kept him not to triumph in his Tragedie, nor to spend his dayes in slauerie, but feeding his fancie with all delightes and pleasures that Arte or Nature could afford: For in him shee fixed her cheifest felicitie, and lusted after his beautie: But hee seeking to aduance his name by Martiall discipline and Knightly attempts, vtterly refused her proffered courtesies, and highly disdaind to affect so wicked a creature: who seeing her loue bestowed in vaine, vpon a time beeing in the secretst corner of her Caue, began to flatter him in this maner. Thou knowest (Sir Knight) how worthily I haue deserued thy Loue, and how for thy sake I haue kept my Uirginity vnstained, yet thou more cruell then ye Tigers bred in Libia , reiectest mee. Deare Knight, fulfill my disires, and at thy pleasure my charmes shall practise wondrous thinges, as to mooue the heauens to raine a showre of stones vpon thy enemies, to conuert the Sunne to fire, the Moone to blood, or make a desolation of the whole world. The noble Knight Saint George considered in his minde that Loue would make the wisest blind: Therefore by her faire promises he hoped to obtaine his liberty, the which moued him to make her this answere: Most wise and learned Kalyb , the wonder of the world, I condiscend to all thy desires, vpon this condition, that I may bee sole Protector and Gouernour of this Inchaunted Caue, and that thou describe to me my birth, my name, and Parentage: whereto she willingly consented, and began her discourse in this maner: Thou art by birth, said shee, sonne to the Lord Albert high Steward of England , and to this day haue I kept thee as my childe within these solitary woodes: so taking him by the hand, shee led him to a brazen Castle, wherein remayned as prisoners, sixe of the brauest Knights in the world. These are said she, sixe of the worthiest Champions of Christendome: the first is Saint Dennis of Fraunce , the second Saint Iames of Spaine , the third Saint Anthonie of Italie , the fourth Saint Andrew of Scotland , the fift S. Patrick of Ireland , the sixt Saint Dauid of Wales , whereof thou art borne to bee the seuenth, and thy name Saint George of England , for so thou shalt be termed in time to come. Then leading him a little further, she brought him into a large faire roome, where stood seuen of the goodliest Steedes that euer the world beheld, sixe of these (said shee) belong to the sixe Champions, and the seuenth will I bestow on thee, whose name is Bayard: likewise shee led him to another roome, where hung the richest Armour that euer eye beheld: so choosing out the strongest corslet from her Armorie, shee with her owne handes buckled it on his brest, laced on his Helme, and attyred him with with rich Caparison: then fetching forth a mightie fauchion, she put it like wise in his hand, Now (said she) art thou armed in richer furniture, than was Ninus the first Monarch of the world: thy steede is of such force and inuincible power, that whilest thou art mounted on his backe, there can bee no Knight in all the world so hardy as to conquer thee: Thy Armour of the purest Lidian steele, that neither weapon can peirce, nor Battell axe bruse: thy sword which is called Ascalon , is framed of such excellent mettall, by the curious workemanship of the Cyclops , that it will seperate & cut the hardest flint & hew in sunder the strongest steele: for in the pummell lies such precious vertue, that neither treason, witchcraftes, nor any violence can be proffered thee, so long as thou wearest it. Thus the lustfull Kalyb was so blinded in her owne conceit, that shee not onely bestowed the riches of her Caue, vpon him, but gaue him power and authoritie through a siluer wand which she put in his hand, to worke her owne destruction: for comming by a huge great rocke of stone, this valiant minded Knight strooke his charming rod thereon: whereat it opened, and shewed apparantly before his eyes, a number of sucking babes, which the inchantresse had murthered by her witchcraftes & sorceries. O, said shee, this is a place of horror, where nought is heard but scrikes and rufull grones of dead mens soules: but if thy cares can endure to heare them, and thy eyes behold them, I will leade the way. So the Lady of the woods, boldly stepping in before, little mistrusting the pretended pollicie of S. George , was deceiued in her owne practises: for no sooner entred she the rocke, but hee strooke his siluer wand thereupon, and immediatly it closed, where she bellowed forth exclamations to the sencelesse stones, without all hope of deliuery. Thus this noble Knight deceiued the wicked Inchantresse Kalyb , and set the other sixe Champions likewise at libertie, who rendred him all Knightly curtesies, gaue him thankes for their safe deliuery. So storing themselues with all thinges according to their desires, tooke their iournies fro the inchanted groue, whose proceeding fortunes & heroicall aduentures shall be shewed in this Chapter following. Kalybs Lamentation in the rocke of stone, her Will and Testament, and how shee was torne in peeces by Spirits; with other things that happened in the Caue. But after the departure of the seuen worthie Champions, Kalyb seeing her selfe fast closed in the rocke of stone, by the pollicie of the English Knight, grew into such extreme passion of minde, that shee cursed the houre of her creation, and bitterly banned all motions of coniuration, the earth shee wearied with her cries, whereby the very stones seemed to relent, and as it were, wept cristall teares, and sweat with very anguish of her greife: the blasted Oakes that grewe about the Inchanted rocke, likewise seemed to rue at her exclamations: the blustring winds were silent: the murmuring of Birds still, and a solitarie dumbnesse tooke possession of euery creature that abode within the circuite of the woodes, to heare her wofull Lamentation, which she vttered in this maner. O miserable Kalyb ! accursed bee thy destinie: for now thou art inclosed within a desolate and darkesome den, where neither Sunne can lend thee comfort with his bright beams, nor aire extend his breathing coolenesse to thy wofull soule: for in the deepe foundations of the earth, thou art for euermore inclosed: that haue beene the wonder of my time for Magicke, I that by Art haue made my iourney to the deepest dungeons of hell, where multitudes of vgly blacke and fearefull spirits haue trembled at my charmes: I that haue bound the furies vp in beds of steele, and caused them to attend my pleasure like swarmes of hornets, that ouer spread the mountaines in Egypt , or the flies vpon the parched hils, where the tawnie-tanned Mores do inhabite, am now constrayned to languish in eternall darkenes: woe to my soule, woe to my charmes, and woe to all my magicke spels: for they haue bound me in this hollow rocke: pale be the brightnesse of the cleere Sunne, and couer earth with euerlasting darkenesse: skies turne to pitch, the elements to flaming fire, rore hell, quake earth, swell Seas, blast earth, rockes rend in twaine, all creatures mourne at my confusion, and sigh at Kalybs wofull and pittifull exclamations. Thus wearied shee the time away, one while accusing Fortune of tyranny, another while blaming the falshood and trechery of the English Knight, sometimes tearing her curled lockes of bristled haire, that like a wreath of snakes hung dangling downe her deformed necke, then beating her breastes, another while rending her ornaments, whereby shee seemed more like a fury then any earthly creature, so impatient was this wicked Inchauntresse Kalyb , & being frustrate of all hope of recouerie, began afresh to thunder forth these tearmes of coniuration: Come, come you Princes of the elements, come, come & teare the rocke in pieces, and let mee not be inclosed vp in the eternall languishment: appeare you shadowes of blacke mistie night: Magoll, Cumath, Helueza, Zontomo : Come when I call, venite, festinate, inquam . At which wordes the earth began to quake, and the very elements to tremble: for all the spirits both of aire of earth, of water, and of fire, were obedient to her charmes, and by multitudes came flocking at her call: some from the fire, in the likenes of burning Dragons, breathing from their fearefull nostrels, sulphure and flaming brimstone, some from the water in shape of Fishes, with other deformed creatures, that haue their abidings in the Seas, some from the ayre the purest of the elements, in the likenesse of Angels and other bright shadowes, and other some from the grosse earth most vgly, blacke and dreadfull to beholde. So when the legions of Spirits had incompast the wicked Inchantresse, hell began to rore such an infernall and harsh melodis, that the Inchanted rocke burst in twaine, and then Kalybs charmes took no effect, for her Magicke no longer endured, then the terme of an hundred yeeres, the which as then were fully finished and brought to end: for the Obligation which shee subscribed with her dearest bloud, and sealed with her owne hands, was brought as a witnes against her, by which shee knew, and fully perswaded her selfe, that her life was fully come to end: therefore in this fearefull maner she began to make her Will and latest Testament. First welcome (sayd she) my sad executours, welcome my graue and euerlasting toombe, for you haue digd it in the fierie lakes of Phlegethon , my winding sheet wherein to shrowd both my bodie and condemned soule, is a Caldron of boyling lead and brimstone, and the wormes that should consume my Carkasse, are the fierie forkes, which tosse burning fire-brands from place to place, from furnace to furnace, and from caldron to caldron, therefore attend to Kalybs wofull Testament, and ingraue the Legacies she giues in brasse rolles, vppon the burning bankes of Acheron . First, these eyes that now too late weepe helpelesse teares, I giue vnto the watrie spirits, for they haue rakt the treasures hidden in deepest Seas to satisfie their most insatiate lookes: next, I bequeath these hands which did subscribe the bloudie Obligation of my perpetuall banishment from ioy, vnto those spirits that houer in the ayre: my tongue that did conspire against the Maiestie of Heauen, I giue to those spirits which haue their being in the fire: my earthly heart, I bequeath to those grose Daemons that dwell in the dungeons of the earth, and the rest of my condemned body, to the torments due to my deseruings. Which strange and feareful Testament, being no sooner ended, but all the spirits generally at one instance, seyzed vpon the Inchantresse, and dismembred her bodie to a thousand peeces, and diuided her limmes to the corners of the earth; one member to the ayre, another to the water, another to the fire, and another to the earth, which was carried away in a moment by the spirits, that departed with such a horror, that all things within the hearing thereof sodainely dyed, both Beastes, Byrdes, and all creeping wormes which remained within the compasse of those inchanted woods: for the trees which before were wont to flourish with greene leaues, withered away and died, the blades of grasse perished for want of naturall moysture, which the watry clouds denied to nourish in so wicked a place. Thus by the iudgements of the heauens, senseles things perished for the wickednes of Kalyb , whom we leaue to her endles torments both of body and soule, and returne to the seuen worthy Champions of Christendome, whose laudable aduentures, fame hath inrold in the books of memorie. How Saint George slew the burning Dragon in Egypt, and redeemed Sabra the Kings daughter from death: How hee was betrayed by Almidor the blacke King of Moroco, and sent to the Souldan of Persia, where he slew two Lyons, and remained seuen yeeres in pryson. After the seuen Champions departed from ye inchanted Caue of Kalyb , they made their abode in the Citty of Couentrie, for the space of nine moneths, in which time they erected vp a sumptuous & costly monument, ouer the herse of Saint Georges Mother, and so in that time of the yeere, when the spring had ouerspred the earth, with the mantles of Flora , they armed themselues like wandring Knights, and tooke their iourney to seeke for forraine aduentures, accounting no dishonour so great, as to spend their dayes in idlenes, atchieuing no memorable accident: so trauailing for the space of thirty dayes without any aduenture worthy the noting, at length came to a large broad plaine, whereon stood a brazen piller, whereat 7. seuerall waies deuided, which caused the seuen Knights to forsake each others company, and to take euery one a contrary way, where wee leaue sixe of the Champions to their contented trauailes, and wholy discourse vpon the fortunate successe of our worthie English Knight, who after some few moneths trauaile, happily ariued within the territories of Egypt , which countrey as then was greatly annoyed with a dangerous Dragon, but before hee had iournied fully the distance of a mile, the silent night approched, and solitary stilnesse tooke possession of all liuing things: at last hee espied an old poore Hermitage, wherein hee purposed to rest his horse, & to take some repast after his wearie iourney, till the Sun had renewed his mornings light, that hee might fall to his trauaile againe: but entring the cottage, hee found an aged Hermit ouer worne with yeeres, and almost consumed with greife,: to whome in this manner he began to conferre: Father (said he) for so you seeme by your grauitie may a trauailer for this night craue entertaynement within your cottage, not onely for himselfe but his horse: or is there some Citie neere at hand, whereto I may take my iourney without danger? The old man starting at the sudden approch of Saint George , replied vnto him in this order. Sir Knight (quoth hee) of thy countery I neede not demaund, for I know it by thy Burgonet, (for indeed there on were grauen the Armes of England,) but I sorrow for thy hard fortune, that it is thy destinie to arriue in this our countery of Egypt , wherein is not left sufficient alme to bury the dead, such is the distresse of this land, through a dangerous and terrible Dragon nowe ranging vp and downe the Countrey, which if he be not euery day appeased with a pure and true virgin, which hee deuoureth downe his venimous bowels, but that day so neglected, will he breath such a stinch from his nostrels, whereof will grow a most grieuous plague and mortalitie of all thinges, which vse hath beene obserued for these foure and twentie yeeres, but now there is not left one true virgin but the kings onely daughter throughout Egypt , which Damosell to morrow must be offered vp in sacrifice to the Dragon: Therefore the king hath made Proclamation, that if any Knight dare proue so aduenturous as to combate with the Dragon, and preserue his daughters life, shall in reward haue her to his wife, and the crowne of Egypt after his decease. This large proffer so encouraged the English Knight, that he vowed eyther to redeeme the Kings Daughter, or else to loose his life in that honorable enterprise. So taking his repose and nightly rest in the olde mans Hermitage, till the chearefull Cocke beeing the true messenger of day, gaue him warning of the Sunnes vp-rise, which caus'd him to buckle on his Armour, and to furnish his Steede with strong habilliments of warre. the which being done, he tooke his iourney, guided onely by the olde Hermite to the valley where the Kings Daughter should be offered vp in sacrifice. But when he approched the sight of the valley, he espyed a farre off a most fayre and beautifull Damsell, attired in pure Arabian silke, going to sacrifice, garded to the place of death, onely by sage and modest Matrons: which wofull sight so encouraged the English Knight to such a forwardnesse, that hee thought euery minute a day, till hee had redeemed the Damsell from the Dragons tyranny: so approching the Lady, gaue her comfort of deliuerie, and returnde her backe to her Fathers Pallace againe. After this the Noble Knight like a bold aduenturous Champion, entred the valley, where the Dragon had his residence, who no sooner had a sight of him, but hee gaue such a terrible yell, as though it had thundered in the elements: the bignes of the Dragon was fearefull to behold, for betwixt his shoulders and his tayle were fiftie foote in distance, his scales glistered brighter then siluer, but farre more harder then brasse, his belly of the colour of golde, but more bigger then a Tun. Thus weltred hee from his hidious denne, and fiercely assailed the sturdie Champion with his burning winges, that at the first encounter, he had almost felled him to the ground: but the Knight nimbly recouering himselfe, gaue the Dragon such a thrust with his speare, that it shiuered in a thousand peeces: whereat the furious Dragon so fiercely smote him with his venymous tayle, that downe fell man and horse, in which fall two of Saint Georges ribs were sore brused: but yet stepping backward, it was his chance to leape vnder an Orringe tree, which tree had such precious vertue, that no venymous worme durst come within the compasse of the braunches, nor within seuen foote thereof, where this valiant Knight rested himselfe, vntill hee had recouered his former strength. who no sooner feeling his spirits reuiued, but with an eager courage smote the burning Dragon vnder his yellow burnisht belly with his trustie sword Askalon , whereout came such aboundance of venome, that it sprinkled vppon the Champions armour, whereby immediately through the impoysoned strength of the venome his Armour burst in twaine, and the good Knight fell into a grieuous and dead sound, that for a time hee lay breathles: but yet hauing that good memory remaining, that hee tumbled vnder the branches of the Orringe tree, in whih place the Dragon coulde proffer him no further violence. The fruite of the tree was of such an excellent vertue that whosoeuer tasted thereof, should presently bee cured of all maner of diseases and infirmities whatsoeuer. So it was the Noble Champions good and happie fortune, a little to recouer through the vertue of the tree, & to espie an Orringe which a little before had dropped downe, wherewith hee so refreshed him selfe, that he was in short time as sound as when he first began the incouter. Then kneeled he downe, & made his diuine supplication to heauen, that God would send him (for his deare sonnes sake) such strength and agilitie of bodie, as to slay the furious and terrible monster: which being done with a bolde and couragious heart, he smote the Dragon vnder the wing, where it was tender without scale, whereby his good sword Askalon with an easie passage went to the very hilts through both the Dragons heart, liuer, bone, and blood, whereout issued such aboundance of purple gore that it turned the grasse which grewe in the valley, into a crimson coulour, and the ground which before partched through the burning stinch of the Dragon, was now drenched with ouermuch moisture which voyded from his venemous bowels, where at last through want of blood, and long continuance in fight, the Dragon yeelded his vitall spirites to the mercie of the conquering Champion. The which being happily performed, the Noble Knight Saint George of England , first yeelding due honor to Almightie God for the victorie, then with his good sword Askalon hee cut off the Dragons head, and pitcht it vpon the trunchion of a speare, which at the beginning of the battaile hee shiuered against the Dragons scalie backe. During this long & dangerous Combat, his trustie Steede lay altogether in a sounde without any moouing, which caused the English Champion with all speed to crush the iuyce of an Orenge into his could mouth: the vertue whereof presently expelled the venemous poysons, and recouered his former strength againe. There was as then remaining in the Egyptian Court one Almidor the blacke Knight of Moroco , who long had prosecuted (in the way of marriage) the loue of Sabra the Kings daughter, but by no pollicie, meanes, nor manhood, could hee accomplish what his heart desired: but now finding oportunitie to expresse his trecherous minde, intended to robbe and spoyle Saint George of his victorie, whereby hee thought to attaine the gratious fauour, and singular good liking of his Ladie and Mistresse, who lothed his company like the detested Crocodiles. but euen as the Wolfe though all in vaine barkes at the Moone: So this fantasticall and cowardly Almidor , through many rich gifts and faire promises, hired twelue Egyptian Knights to beset the valley where Saint George slew the burning Dragon, and by force bereaue him of his conquest. But when this magnanimious champion of England came ryding in triumph from the valley, espected to haue beene entertained like a Conquerour with Drums and Trumpets, or to haue heard the belles of Egypt rung a ioyfull sound of victorie, or to haue seene the streetes beautified with bonefires: then contrary to his imagination, was hee met with Troupes of Armed Knights, not to conduct him peacefully to the Egyptian Court, but by falshood and trechery to dispoyle him of his life and honour: For no sooner had hee ridden past the entry of the valley, but he espied how the Egyptian Knights brandished their weapons, and deuided themselues to intercept him in his iourney to the Court: By which hee knew them to bee no faithfull friends, but vowed enemies. So tying his Horse to a Hathorne tree, he intended to try his fortune on foote for feare of disaduantage, they beeing twelue to one: but in the skirmish Saint George so valiantly behaued himselfe with his trustie sword Askalon , that at one stroke hee slue three of the Egyptian Knights, and before the golden diamond of heauen had wandred the Zodiack the compasse of an houre: but some hee dismembred of their heads: some had their limmes lopt off: some their bodies cut in twaine, and some their intrayles trayling downe, so that not one was left aliue to carrie newes to Almidor the black King, which stood (during all the time of skirmish) a far off vpon a mountaine toppe, to behold the successe of his hired Champions But when hee saw the Egyptians bloudy Tragedies, & how the happy fortune of the English Knight had wonne the honour of the day, hee accursed his destinie, and accused the Queene of chance with crueltie, for disappointing his pretended enterprise: but hauing a heart frought with all wicked motions, secretly vowed in his soule, to practise by some other trecherie S. Georges vtter confusion. So running before to the Court of King Ptolomie , not reuealing what had hapned to the twelue Egyptian Knights, but crying in euery place as hee went, Victoria, Victoria , the enemie of Egypt is slaine. Then Ptolomie commaunded euery streete of the Cittie to be hung with rich Arras and imbroidered Tapestrie, and likewise prouided a sumptuous Charriot of gold, the wheeles and other timber worke of the purest Ebonie, the couering thereof was made of purple silke, crosse-bard with staues of gold: Likewise an hundred of the Noblest Yeeres of Egypt , attired in Crimson veluet and white, mounted on milke white Coursers with rich Caparison, attended the comming of S. George . Thus were all thinges appointed for his honourable intertainement, which they perfourmed in such solemne order, that I lacke memorie to describe it: For when hee first entred the gates of the Cittie, hee heard such a melodious harmonie of heauenly sounding Musicke, that it seemed in his conceit to surpasse the sweetnesse of the Cherubins, or the holy company of Angels. Then they most royally presented him with a sumptuous and costly pall of golde, and after inuested him in that Iuorie Chariot, wherein hee was conducted to the Pallace of King Ptolomie , where this noble and Princely minded Champion, surrendred vp his conquest and victorie to the seemely handes of the beautious Sabra: where shee with like curtesie and more humilitie requited his bountie: For at the first sight of the English Knight, shee was so rauished with his Princely countenance, that for a time shee was not able to speake: Yet at last taking him by the hand, shee led him to a rich pauillion, where she vnarmed him, and with most precious salues imbalmed his woundes, and with her teares washed away the bloud: which being done, shee furnished a table with all maner of delicates for his repast, where her Father was present, who demaunded his Country, Parentage and name: after the banquet was ended, he installed him with the honour of Knighthood, and put vpon his feete a paire of golden spurs. But Sabra , who fed vpon the banquet of his loue, conducted him to his nightes repose, where shee sate vpon his bed, and warbled forth most heauenly melody, vpon her Lute, till his senses were ouercome with a sweete and silent sleepe, where shee left him for that night after his dangerous battell. But no sooner did Auroraes radiant blush distaine the beautie of the East, and the Sunne shew his morning countenance, but Sabra repayred to the English Champions lodging, and at his first vprising presented him with a Diamond of most rare and excellent vertue, the which he wore vpon his finger. The next that entered his lodging, was the trecherous Almidor the blacke King of Moroco , hauing in his hand, a boule of Greekish wine, which hee offered to the Noble Champion Saint George of England: but at the receit thereof, the Diamond the Ladie gaue him, which he wore vpon his finger, waxed pale, and from his nose fell three drops of bloud, whereat hee started: which sodaine accident caused the kings daughter to suspect some secret poyson compounded in the Wine, and thereupon so vehemently scriked, that a sodaine vprore presently ouerspread the whole Court, whereby it came to the Kings intelligence of the proffered trecherie of Almidor against the English Champion: But so deare was the loue of the Egyptian King, to the blacke King of Moroco , that no beleefe of treachery could enter into his mind. Thus Almidor the second time was preuented of his practise, whereat in minde hee grewe more inraged then the chafed Bore; yet thinking the third should pay for all: So spying a time wherein to worke his wicked purpose, which he brought to passe in this manner. Many a day remayned Saint George in the Egyptian Court, sometimes reuelling amongst Gentlemen, dancing and sporting with Ladies, other times in Tilts and Turniments, with other Honorable exercises: Likewise long and extreame was the loue that beautious Sabra bore to the English Champion, of the which this trecherous Almidor had intelligence by many secret practises, and many times his eares were witnes of their discourses. So vppon an Euening, when the gorgeous Sunne lay leuell with the ground, it was his fortune to walke vnder a garden wall, to take the coolenes of the Euenings aire, where vnseene of the two Louers, hee heard their amorous discourses as they sate dallying in the bower of Roses, courting one another in this maner. My soules delight, my heartes cheife comfort, sweete George of England , saide the loue-sicke Sabra ! Why art thou more obdurate then the flint, which the teares of my true heart can neuer mollifie? How many thousand sighes haue I breathde for thy sweete sake, which I haue sent to thee as true messengers of loue, yet neuer wouldest thou requite me with a smiling countenance? Refuse not her, deare Lord of England, that for thy loue will forsake her parents, Countrey and inheritance, which is the Crowne of Egypt , and like a pilgrime follow thee throughout the wide world, O therefore knit that gordion knot of wedlocke, that none but death can afterwardes vntie, that I may say, The sunne shall loose his brightnes, the Moone her splendant beames, the Sea her tydes, and all things vnder the cope of heauen grow contrary to kinde, before Sabra the Heire of Egypt prooue vnconstant to Saint George of England . These wordes so fired the Champions heart, that hee was almost intangled in the snares of loue, which beforetime onely affected Martiall discipline: But yet to trie her patience a little more, made her this answere: Ladie of Egypt , canst thou not bee content, that I haue ventured my life to set thee free from death, but that I should linke my future fortunes in a womans lap, and so bury all my honours in obliuion? No no, Sabra, George of England is a Knight borne in a Countrey where true Chiualrie is nourisht, and hath sworne to search the world, so farre as euer the lampe of heauen doth lend his light, before hee tie himselfe to the troublesome state of marriage, therefore attempt mee no more, that am a stranger and a wanderer from place to place: but seeke to aime at higher states as the King of Moroco , who will attempt to clime the heauens to gaine thy loue and good liking: at which speeches shee suddainely replyed in this maner: The King of Moroco is as bloudy minded as a Serpent, but thou more gentle then a Lambe, his tongue as ominous as the skriking night-owle, but thine more sweeter then the mornings Larke: his kind imbracings like the stinging Snakes, but thine more pleasant then the creeping vine. What if thou beest a Knight of a strange countrie? thy body is more pretious to mine eyes, then Kingdomes in my heart. There stay (replyed the English Champion,) I am a Christian, thou a Pagan: I honour God in heauen, thou earthly shadowes below: therefore if thou wilt obtaine my loue and liking, thou must forsake thy Mahomet , and bee christened in our Christian faith. With all my soule, (answered the Egyptian Lady) will I forsake my countrie Gods, and for thy loue become a Christian: and there withall shee burst a ring intwaine, the one halfe shee gaue to him in pledge of Loue, and kept the other halfe her selfe: and so for that time departed the Garden. But during all the time of their discourses, the trecherous minded Almidor stoode listning to their speeches, and fretted inwardly to the very gall, to heare the Mistresse of his heart reiect his former curtesies: Therefore intending now or neuer to infringe their plighted band, went in all hast to the Egyptian King, and in this manner made his supplication. Know great Monarch of the East, that I haue a secret to vnfold, which toucheth neerely the safegard of your countrey. It was my chance this Euening at shutting vp of Titans golden gates, to take the comfort of the Westerne breathing ayre, vnder your priuate Garden walkes, where I heard (though all vnseene) a deepe pretended Treason betwixt your Daughter and the English Knight, where shee hath vowde to forsake her God, and beleeue as the Christians doe, and likewise she intends to flie from her natiue countrie, and to go with this wandring traueller, which hath beene so highly honoured in your Court. Nowe by Mahomet, Apollo , and Termigaunt , three Gods wee Egyptians commonly adore (sayd the King) this damned Christian shall not gaine the conquest of my daughters loue, for he shall lose his head, though not by violence in our Egyptian Court. Therefore Almidor , be secret. in my intent, for I will send him to my cosen the Persian Soldan, from whence he shall neuer returne to Egypt againe, except his Ghost bring newes of bad successe vnto my daughter: & thereupon they presently contriued this Letter. thee the mightie Soldan of Persia , great Emperour of the prouinces of bigger Asia . This is to request thee vpon the league of freindship betwixt vs, to shewe the bearer hereof thy seruant death, for he is an vtter enemie to all Asia and Affrica , and a proud contemner of our Religion: Therefore fayle mee not in my request, as thou wilt answere on thine oath, and so in hast farewell. Thy kinsman Ptolomie the King of Egypt. Which Letter being no sooner subscribed and sealed with the great Seale of Egypt , but Saint George was dispatched with Embassage for Persia , with the bloody sentence of his owne destruction: to the true deliuery whereof, he was sworne by the honour of his Knighthood, and for his pawne he left behind him his good Steede, and his trustie sworde Askalon , in the keeping of Ptolomie the Egyptian King, onely taking for his puruay and easie trauell one of the Kings horses. Thus the Innocent Lambe betrayed by the wily Foxe, was sent to the hunger- starued Lyons den, being suffered not once to giue his Lady and Mistresse vnderstanding of his sodaine departure, but traueled day and night through many a long and solitarie Wildernesse, without any aduenture worthy the memorie, but that he heard the dismall crie of Night Rauens thundring in his eares, and the fearefull sound of Crickets in the creuises of the earth, and such like messengers of mischance, which foretelled some fatall accident to bee at hand: yet no feare could daunt his noble minde, nor danger hinder his entended trauell, till he had a sight of the Soldans Pallace, which seemed more like a Paradise, than any earthly habitation; for as the Historie reports, the walls and towers of the Pallace were of the purest Marble stone, the windowes of carued siluer worke, inamiled with Indian Pearle, beset with lattine and chrystall glasse, the outward wals and buildings painted with gold, the pillers and gates were all of brasse, about the Pallace was a mightie ditch, of a wonderfull bredth and depth, ouer the ditch stood a stately bridge, erected vp with sumptuous workemanship of grauen Images, vnder the bridge a hundred siluer bels were hung by Arte, so yt no creature might passe into the Pallace, but they gaue warning to the Soldans Gard; at the ende of the bridge was built an Alablaster Tower, whereon stood an Eagle of gold, his eyes of the richest precious stones, the brightnesse whereof glistered so much, that all the Pallace did shine with the light thereof. Upon the day ( Saint George entred the Soldans Court) when the Persians solemnely sacrificed to their Gods Mahomet, Apollo, Termigaunt , which vnchristian Procession so mooued the impatience of the English Champion, that he tooke the ensignes and streamers whereon the Persian Gods were pictured, and trampled them vnder his feete: whereupon the Pagans presently fledde to the Soldan for succour, and shewed him how a strange Knight had despised their Mahomet , and trampled their Banners in the dust. Then presently he sent a hundred of his armed Knights, to know the cause of that sodaine vprore, and to bring the christian Champion bound vnto his Maiesty; but the Persian Knights were intertaind with such a bloudly banquet, that some of their heads ran tumbling in the streetes, and the Channels ouerflowed with streames of bloud: the Pauements of the Pallace were ouerspread with slaughtered men, and the walles besprinkled with purple gore: so victoriously hee behaued hinselfe against the enemies of Christ, that ere the Sunne had declined in the West, hee brought to ground an hundred of the Soldans Souldiers, and inforced the rest, like flockes of sheepe, to flie to the Soldan for ayde and succour, which as then remained in the Pallace with the gard of three thousand souldiers: Who at the report of this vnexpected vprore, furnished his souldiers with habillements of warre, and came marching from his Pallace with such a mightie power, as though the strength of Christendome had beene come to inuade the territories of Asia . But such was the inuincible courage of Saint George , that hee encountred with them all, and made such a Massacre in the Soldans Court, that the Pauements were ouerspread with slaughtered Persians , and the Pallace gate stuffed with heapes of murdered Pagans. At the last, the larum Belles were caused to be rung, and the Beacons set on fire, whereat the Commons of the Countrie rose in Armes, and came flocking about the English Champion like swarmes of Bees: where at last through his long encounter, and the multitude of his enemies, his neuer daunted courage was forced to yeeld, and his restlesse arme wearied with fight, constrayned to let his weapons fall to the ground. Thus he, whose fortitude sent thousands to wander on the bankes of Acharon , stood now obedient to the mercies of ten thousand, which with their brandishing weapons, and sharpe edged fauchions inuironed him about. Now bloudy-minded monster (said the Soldan) what country man soeuer thou art, Iew, Pagan, or misbeleeuing Christian, looke for a sentence of seuere punishment, for euery drop of bloud thy vnhappie hand hath shed: First, thy skinne with sharpe razers shall bee pared from thy flesh aliue: Next, thy flesh with burning Irons seared from thy bones: and lastly, thy cursed limmes drawne in peeces, ioynt from ioynt, with vntamed horses. This bloudy iudgement pronounced by the Soldan, not a little moued Saint George to replie in this maner: Great Potentate of Asia , I craue the libertie and law of Armes, whereto all the Kings of the earth by oath are bound: First, my discent in my natiue Countrey, is of royall bloud, and therefore challenge I a combat: Secondly an Ambassadour I am from Ptolomie , the King of Egypt , and therefore no violence must be proffered mee: Lastly, the lawes of Asia graunt mee safe conduct backe to Egypt : therefore what I haue done, Ptolomie must answer: and thereupon he deliuered the Letter sealed with the great Seale of Egypt , the which was no sooner broken vp and read, but the Soldans eyes sparkled like vnto fire, and vpon his countenance appeared the Image of wrath and discontent. Thou art by the report of Ptolomie (said the Soldan) a great contemner of our Gods, and a dispiser of our lawes: Therefore his pleasure is, that I should end thy dayes by some inhumane death: the which I sweare by Mahomet, Apollo and Termigaunt , to accomplish: and thereupon hee gaue him in keeping to an hundred of his Iannisaries, till the day of execution, which was appointed within thirtie dayes following. So they disrobed him of his apparel, and attired him in simple and base array: his armes, that late were employed to weild the mightie Target, and tosse the waightie Battell-axe, they strongly fettered vp in yron bolts: and those hands, which were wont to bee garnished with steely Gauntlets, they bound vp fast in hempen bands, that the purple bloud trickled downe from his fingers ends, and so being dispoyled of all Knightly dignitie, they conuaid him to a deepe, darke and desolate dungeon, wherein the golden Sunne did neuer shew his splendant beames, nor neuer could the comfortable light of heauen be seene: betwixt the day and night, no difference could be made, the Summers parching heat, and Winters freezing cold, were both alike: his cheifest comfort was, to number the Persians he had slaine in the conflict, one while pondering in his rest, lesse thoughts the ingratitude of Ptolomie the Egyptian King, another while remembring his loue, his vowe and deepe affection that he bare to the Egyptians daughter, and how vnkindely shee tooke his departure, caruing her picture with the nayles of his fingers vpon the walles of the dungeon: to which sencelesse substance hee many times would thus complaine: O cruell destinies! why is this greiuous punishment allotted to my penance? Haue I conspired against the maiestie of heauen, that they haue throwne this vengeance on my head? shall I neuer recouer my former libertie, that I may be reuenged vpon the causers of my imprisonment? frowne angry heauens, vpon these bloudy minded Pagans, those daring miscreants, and professed enemies of Christ, and may the plagues of Pharao light vpon their countryes, & the misery of Oedipus vpon their princes: yt they may bee eye witnesses of their daughters rauishments, and beholde their Citties flaming like the burning battlements of Troy . Thus lamented hee the losse of his libertie, accursing his birth-day, and houre of his creation, wishing that it neuer might be numbred in the yeere, but counted ominous to all insuing ages: his sighes exceeded the number of the Ocean sands, and his teares the water bubbles in a raynie day, and as one diminished, another presently appeared. Thus sorrow was his companion, and despaire his chiefe sollicitor, till Hyperion with his golden coach had thirtie times rested in Thetis purple Pallace, and Cinthia thirtie times daunst vpon the Chrystall waues: which was the very time his complete mones should ende, according to the seuere and cruell iudgement of the Soldan of Persia . But by what extraordinary meanes hee knew not. So looking euery minute of an houre to entertaine the wished messenger of death, hee heard a farre off the terrible roaring of two hunger- starued Lyons, which for the space of foureteene dayes had beene restrained from their foode, and naturall sustinance, onely to deuoure and staunch their hunger-starued bowels with the body of this thrice renowned Champion: which cry of ye Lyons so terrified his minde, that the hayre of his head grew stiffe, and his browes sweat blood through anguish of his soule, so extreemely hee feared the remorselesse stroke of death, that by violence he burst the chaines in sunder wherewith he was bound, and rent the curled tresses from his head, that were of the colour of Amber, the which he wrapped about his armes against the assault of the Lyons, for he greatly suspected them to be the ministers of his tragedie, which indeede so fell out: for at that same instant they descended the dungeon, being brought thither by the gard of Iannisaries, onely to make a full period of the Champions life. But such was the inuincible fortitude of Saint George , and so politike his defence, that when the starued Lyons came running on him with open Iawes, he valiantly thrust his sinewed armes into their throat (beeing wrapped about with the hayre of his head) whereby they presently choaked and so he pulled out their bloody hearts. Which spectacle the Soldans Iannisaries beholding, were so amazed with feare, that they ran in all haste to the Pallace, and certified the Soldan what had happened, who commanded euery parte of the Court to bee strongly garded with armed souldiers, supposing the English knight rather to bee some monster ascended from the sea, then any creature of humane substance, or els one possessed with some diuine inspiration, that by the force of armes had accomplished so many aduenturous Stratagems: such a terrour assayled the Soldans heart, seeing hee had slayne two Lyons, and slaughtered two thousand Persians with his owne hands, and likewise had intelligence how he slewe a burning Dragon in Egypt , that he caused the dungeon to bee closed vp with bars of Iron, least he should by pollicie or fortitude recouer his libertie, & so indanger the whole countrey of Persia: where hee remained in want, penury, and great necessitie, for the terme of seuen winters, feeding onely vpon rats and mice, with other creeping wormes which hee caught in the dungeon. During which time he neuer tasted of the bread of corne, but of wheate-branne, and channell water, which dayly was serued him through the Iron grates, where now wee leaue Saint George , languishing in great miserie, and returne againe into Egypt , where we left Sabra the Champions betrothed Lady, lamenting the want of his company, whome shee loued dearer then any Knight in all the world. Sabra , that was the fayrest mayd that euer mortall eye behelde, in whom both Arte and nature seemed to excell in curious workemanship, her bodie being comlier then the stately Cedar, and her beautie purer then the Paphian Queenes: the one with ouerburthened greife was quite altered, and the other stayned with floods of brackish teares, that dayly trickled downe her Chrystall cheekes: whereby shee found the very image of discontent, the mappe of woe, and the onely mirrour of sorrow, she accounted all companie lothesome to her sight, and excluded the fellowshippe of all Ladies, onely betaking her selfe to a solitarie Cabbinet, where shee sate sowing manie a wofull storie vppon a crimson sampler: whereon sometimes bathing a wounded heart with luke- warme teares, that fell from the conduits of her eyes, then presently with her crisped lockes of hayre, which dangled downe her Iuorie necke, she dried vp the moysture of her sorrowfull teares: then thinking vppon the plighted promises of her deare beloued knight, fel into these passionate and pitifull complaints: O Loue (sayd shee) more sharper then the pricking brier, with what vnequalitie doest thou torment my wounded heart, not linking my deare Lorde in the like affection of minde? O Venus if thou bee imperious in thy Deitie, to whome both Gods and men obey, command my wandred Lorde to returne againe, or that my soule may flee into the clowdes that by the winds it may be blowne into his sweete bosome, where liues my bleeding heart. But foolish fondling that I am, he hath reiected me, and shuns my company like the Syrens , els had hee not refused the Court of Egypt where hee was honoured like a King, and wandered the world to seeke another loue. No, no, it cannot be: he beares no such vnconstant minde, for I greatly feare, some trechery hath bereau'd me of his sight, or els some stony pryson includes my George from mee. If it be so, sweete Morpheus , thou God of golden dreames, reueale to mee my loues abiding, that in my sleepe his shadow may appeare and report the cause of his departure. After this passion was breathed from the mansion of her soule, shee committed her watchfull eyes to the gouernment of sweete sleepe, which being no sooner closed, but there appeared, as shee thought, the shadow and very shape of her dearely beloued Lord, Saint George of England , not as he was wont to bee, flourishing in his grauen Burgonet of steele, or mounted on a stately Genet, deckt with a watchet plume of spangled feathers, but in ouerworn and simple attyre, with pale lookes and leane body, like to a Ghost risen from some hollow graue, breathing as it were, these sad and wofull passions: Sabra, I am betrayd for loue of thee, And logde in hollow Caues of dismall night: From whence I neuer more shall come to see, Thy louing countenance and beautie bright. Remaine thou true and constant for my sake, That of thy loue, they may no conquest make. Let tyrants thinke if euer I obtayne, What now is lost by treasons cursed guile: False Egypts scourge I surely will remaine, And turne to streaming blood Morocos smile. The damned dogge of Barbarie shall rue, The balefull stratagems that will ensue. The Persian towers shall smoke with fire, And loftie Babylon be tumbled downe: The Crosse of Christendome shall then aspire, To weare the proud Egyptian triple crowne. Ierusalem and Iuda shall behold, The fall of Kings by Christian Champions bold. Thou maid of Egypt, still continue chaste, A Tyger seekes thy virgins name to spill: Whil'st George of England is in pryson pla'st, Thou shalt be forc't to wed against thy will. But after this shall happen wondrous things, For from thy wombe shall spring three mightie kings. This strange and tragicall discourse being no sooner ended, but shee awaked from her sleepe, and presently reached foorth her seemely hands, thinking to embrace him, but shee catched nothing but the brittle ayre, which caused her to renue her former complaints. O wherefore died I not in this my troublesome dreame (sayd the sorrowfull Lady) that my Ghost might haue haunted those inhumane monsters which falsely betrayed the brauest Champion vnder the cope of heauen? yet for his sake will I exclaime against the ingratitude of Egypt , and like the rauisht Philomele , fill euerie corner of the land with ecchoes of his wrong: my woes shall exceede the sorrowes of Dido queene of Carthage , mourning for the ingratiude of Æneas : with such like passions wearied she the time away, till twelue moneths were fully finished: at last her father vnderstanding what feruent affection she bore to the English Champion, began in this maner to dilate: Daughter (sayd the Egyptian King) I charge thee by the band of nature, and the true obedience thou oughtest to beare my age, to banish and exclude all fond affections from thy mind, and not to settle thy loue vpon a wandring knight that is vnconstant, and without habitation: thou seest hee hath forsaken thee, and returnde into his owne Countrey, where hee hath wedded a wife of that land and nation: therefore I charge thee vpon my displeasure, to affect and loue the blacke King of Moroco , that rightfully hath deserued thy loue, which shall be honourably holden to the honour of Egypt ; and so departed without any answere at all. By which Sabra knew he would not be crost in his will and pleasure: therefore shee sighed out these lamentable words: O vnkinde father, to crosse the affection of his childe, and to force loue where no liking is! Yet shall my minde continue true vnto my deare betrothed Lord, although my body be forced against nature to obay, and Almidor haue the honour of my marriage bed: Yet English George shall enioy my true virginitie, if euer he returne againe to Egypt : and therewith she pulled forth that chaine of gold, and wrapt it seuen times about her Iuorie necke. This (said shee) hath seuen dayes beene steept in Tygers bloud, and seuen nights in Dragons milke, whereby it hath obtainde such excellent vertue, that so long as I weare it about my neck, no man on earth can enioy my virginitie, though I bee forced to the state of marriage, and lye seuen yeeres in wedlocks bed: yet by the vertue of this chaine I shall continue a true virgin. Which words being no sooner ended, but Almidor entred her sorrowfull Cabinet, and presented her with a wedding garment, which was of the pure vnspotted silke, imbost with pearle and rich refined golde, perfumed with sweete Syrian powders: it was of the colour of the Lillie, when Flora had bedeckt the field in May with natures ornaments: so glorious and costly her vestures seemed, and so stately were her Nuptiall rights solemnized, that Egypt admired the bountie of her wedding: which for seuen dayes was holden in the Court of King Ptolomie , and then remooued to Tripolie , the cheife Cittie in Barbarie , where Almidors forced bride was crowned Queene of Moroco: at which crownation the conduits ran with Greekish wines, and the streetes of Tripolie were beautified with Pageants and delightfull shewes. The Court resounded such melodious Harmonie, as though Apollo with his siluer Harpe had descended from the heauens: such tilts, and turnaments were performed betwixt the Egyptian Knights, and the Knights of Barbarie , that they exceeded the nuptials of Hecuba the beautious Queene of Troy : which honourable proceedings, we leaue for this time to their owne contentments: some masking, some dauncing, some reueling, some tilting, and some banqueting. Also leauing the Champion of England Saint George , mourning in the dungeon in Persia as you heard before, and returne to the other sixe Champions of Christendome, which departed from the brazen piller, euery one his seuerall way, whose Knightly and noble aduentures, if the Muses grant mee the bountie of fayre Castalian springs, I will most amply discouer, to the honour of Christendome. How Saint Dennis the Champion of France, liued seuen yeeres in the shape of a Hart, and how proud Eglantine the Kings daughter of Thessalie, was transformed into a Mulberrie tree, and how they both recouered their former shapes by the meanes of Saint Dennis his horse. Calling nowe to memorie the long and wearie trauels Saint Dennis the Champion of France endured, after his departure from the other sixe Champions at the brazen piller, as you heard in the beginning of the former Chapter, from which hee wandred through many a desolate groue and wildernesse, without any aduenture worthy the noting, till he arriued vpon the borders of Thessalie , (being a land as then inhabited with wilde beastes:) wherein hee indured such a penurie and scarsitie of victuals, that hee was forced for the space of seuen yeeres to feed vpon the herbes of the fieldes, and the fruits of trees, till the haires of his head were like to Egles feathers, and the nayles of his fingers to birds clawes: his drinke the dew of heauen, the which hee licked from the flowers in the meddowes, the attyre hee clothed his body withall, Bay leaues and broad dockes, that grew in the woods: his shooes the barke of trees, whereon hee traueled through many a thornie brake: But at last it was his fortune & cruell destinie, (being ouer pressed with the extremitie of hunger) to taste and feede vpon the berries of a Mulberrie tree, whereby hee lost the liuely forme and Image of his humane substance, and was transformed into the shape and likenesse of a wilde Hart: Which strange and sodaine transformation, this noble Champion little mistrusted, till hee espied his misshapen forme in a cleere fountaine, which nature had erected in a coole and shadie valley: but when hee beheld the shadow of his deformed stubstance, and how his head, late honoured with a Burgonet of steele, now dishonoured with a paire of siluane hornes: his face, whereon the countenance of true Nobilitie was late caractered, now couered with a beast-like similitude, and his body late the true Image of magnanimitie, now ouer spred with a hayrie hyde, in coulour like to the follow fieldes: which strange alteration, not a little perplexed the minde of S. Dennis , that it caused him with all speed (hauing the naturall reason of man still remaining) to repaire backe to the mulberrie tree againe, supposing the berries hee had eaten, to be the cause of his transformation, vnder which tree the distressed Knight laid his deformed limmes vpon the bare ground, and thus woefully began to complaine: What Magicke charmes (said he) or rather bewitching Spels, remayne within this accursed tree? whose wicked fruite hath confounded my future fortunes, and conuerted mee to the tipe of miserie? O thou celestiall directer of the world, and all you pittious powers of heauen, looke downe with kindly lookes vpon my haplesse transformation, and bend your browes to heare my wofull lamentation: I was of late a man, but nowe a horned beast, I was a souldier and my Countries Champion; but now a loathsome creature, and a pray for dogs; my glistering Armour is exchanged into a hide of haire; my braue array, more baser then the lowly earth: henceforth in stead of Princely Pallaces, these shadie woods must serue to shrowde me in: wherein my bed of downe must bee a heape of sun-burnde mosse: my sweete recording Musicke the blustring of the winds, that with tempestuous gustes do make the wildernesse to tremble: the companie I dayly keepe must bee the Siluane Satyres, Dyrades, and faire Nymphes, which neuer appeare to worldly eyes, but in twilights, or at the prime of noone: the stars that beautifie the Chrystall vale of heauen, shall henceforth serue as Torches to light me to my woefull bed: the scouling clouds shall bee my Cannopie: my Clocke to count how time runnes stealing on, the sound of hissing snakes, or else the croking of toades. Thus described he his owne miserie, till the watry teares of calamitie gushed in such aboundance from the Conduits of his eyes, that they seemed to quench the burning thunderbolts of heauen, and his scortching sighes so violently forced from his bleeding brest, that they seemed to dim the brightnes of the Sun: whereat the vntamed Beares, & mercilesse Tygers relented at his mones, and like to harmles Lambs sate bleating in the woods, to heare his wofull exclamations. Long and many dayes continued this Champion of France in the shape of a Hart, in more distressed misery than the vnfortunate English Champion in Persia , not knowing how to recouer his former likenes, and humane stubstance. So vpon a time, as hee lamented the losse of natures ornaments vnder the branches of that Mulberie tree, which was the cause of his transformation, hee heard a most grieuous terrible groane, which hee supposed to bee the induction of some admirable accident that would insue: So taking truce for a time with his sorrowes, he heard a hollow voice breathe from the trunke of that Mulbery tree, these words following: Cease to lament, thou famous man of Fraunce; With gentle eares come listen to my mone: In former times it was my fatall chaunce, To be the proudest maide that ere was knowne: By birth I was the daughter of a King, Though now a breathles tree and sencelesse thing. My pride was such that heauen confounded me, A Goddesse in mine owne conceit I was: What nature lent, too base I thought to be, But deem'd my selfe all earthly things to passe: And therefore Nectar and Ambrosia sweete, The foode of heauen for me I counted meete. My pride contemned still the bread of wheate, But purer foode I dayly sought to find, Refined gold was boyled in my meate, Such selfe conceite my fancies fond did blind: For which the Gods aboue transported me, From humane substance to this sencelesse tree. Seuen yeeres in shape of Hart thou must remaine, And then the purple Rose by heauens decree, Shall bring thee to thy former shape againe, And end at last thy wofull miserie: When this is done be sure thou cut in twaine, This fatall tree wherein I doe remaine. After the voyce had breathed these speeches from the Mulberie tree, he stood so much amazed at the strangenes of the wordes, that for a time his sorrowes bereaued him of his speech, and his long appointed punishment constrained his thoughts to lose their naturall vnderstanding: But yet at last recouering his senses, though not his humane likenes, bitterly complained his hard misfortunes. O vnhappie creature (sayd the wofull Champion) more miserable then Progne , in her transformation, and more distressed then Acteon was, whose perfect imitation I am made: His miserie continued but a short season, for his owne dogges the same day tore him in a thousand peeces, and buried his transformed carkas in their hungry bowels: mine is appointed by the angrie destinies, till seuen times the Sommers Sunne hath replenisht his radiant brightnesse, and seuen times the Winters rayne hath washt mee with the showres of heauen. Thus complained the transformed Knight of France , sometimes remembring his former fortunes, and how hee had spent his dayes in the honour of his countrey: sometimes thinking vppon the place of his Natiuitie, renowned France , the Nurse and Mother of his life: sometimes treading with his feete (as for hands he had none) in sandie ground, the print of the words the which the Mulberie tree had repeated, and many times numbring the minutes of his long appointed punishment, with the flowers of the field. Ten thousand sighes he dayly breathed from his brest, and when the blacke and pitchie mantles of darke night had ouerspred the azurde firmaments, and drawne her sable Curtaines before the brightsome windowes of the heauens, all creatures tooke their sweete reposed rest, and committed their tyred eyes to quiet sleepes: All things were silent, except the murmuring of the running waters, which sounding musicke was the cheifest comfort this distressed Champion enioyed: the glistering Queene of night, cladde in her chrystall robes, three hundred times a yeere, was witnes of his nightly lamentations: the wondring Howlet, that neuer sings but in the night, sate yelling ouer his head: the rufull weeping Nightingale with mournefull melodie, cheerefully attended on his person: for during the limitation of his seuen yeeres miserie, his trustie Steede neuer forsooke him, but with all diligence and true loue attended vppon him day and night, neuer wandring away, but euer keeping him companie: If the extreame heate of Sommer were intolerable, or the pinching cold of Winter violent, his Horse would be a shelter to defend him. Thus when the terme of seuen yeers was fully finished, and that hee should recouer his former substance, and humane shape, his good horse which hee tendred as the Apple of his eye, clambered a high and steepie Mountaine, which nature had beautified with all kind of fragrant flowers, as odoriferous as the garden of Hesperides : from whence hee pulled a branch of purple Roses, and brought them betwixt his teeth to his distressed Master, being in his former passions of discontent, vnder the Mulberie tree: The which the Champion of Fraunce no sooner beheld, but hee remembred, that by a purple Rose hee shoulde recouer his former similitude; & so ioyfully receiued the Roses from his trustie Steed: then casting his eyes vp to the celestiall Throne of heauen, he conuayed these consecrated flowers into his emptie stomacke. After which, hee laid him downe vpon the bosome of his mother earth, where he fel into such a sound sleep, that al his senses and vitall spirits were without moouing, for the space of foure and twentie houres, In which time the windowes and the doores of heauen were opened, from whence descended such a showre of raine, that it washed away his hayry forme and beastlike shape: his horned head and long visage were turned againe into a liuely countenance, and all the rest of his members, both armes, legges, handes, feete, fingers, toes, with all the rest of natures giftes, receiued their former shapes. But when the good Champion awaked from his sleepe, and perceiuing the wonderfull workemanship of the Heauens, in transforming him to his humane likenesse: First he gaue honour to Almightie God: next, kissed the ground, whereon he had liued so long in miserie: then beholding his Armour which stood hard by him, bestaind and almost spoyld with rust: his Burgonet & keene edged Curtle-axe besmeared ouer with dust: then lastly pondring in his minde, of the faithfull seruice, his trustie Steed had done him, during the time of his calamitie, whose sable coloured mane hung frizling downe his brawnie necke, which before was wont to be pleyted curiously with artificiall knots, and his forehead which was wont to bee beautified with a tawnie plume of feathers, now disfigured with ouergrowne hayre: whereat the good Champion S. Dennis of France , so much greiued, that hee stroaked downe his Iettie backe, till the hayre of his body lay as smooth as Arabian silke: then pulled hee out his trustie Fauchion, which in many fierce assaults and dangerous combats, had beene bathed in the bloud of his enemies, which by the long continuance of idle time, was almost consumed with cankered rust, but by his labour and industrious paines, he recouered the former beautie & brightnes againe. Thus both his sword, his horse, his Martiall furniture, and other habillements of war, being brought to their first and proper qualities, the noble Champion intended to perseuer and goe forward in the aduenture, in cutting downe the vnhappie Mulberie tree: So taking his sword, which was of the purest Spanish steele, gaue such a stroke at the roote thereof, that at one blow hee cutte it quite in sunder, whereout presently flashed such a mightie flame of fire, that the mane from his horse necke was burned, and likewise the hayre of his owne head had beene fired, if his Helmet had not preserued him: for no sooner was the flame extinguished, but there ascended from the hollow tree, a naked Uirgin, in shape like Daphne which Apollo turnd to Bay, fayrer then Pigmalions Iuorie Image, or the Northren driuen snow, her eyes more clearer then the Icie mountaines her cheekes like Roses dipt in milke, her lips more louelier then the Turkish Rubies, her Alablaster teeth like Indian Pearles, her seemely necke an Iuorie Tower, her daintie breasts a Parradice where milke white Doues may sit and sing, the rest of natures lineaments, a staine to Iuno Queene of heauen: at whose excellent beautie, this valiant and vndaunted Champion more admired, then at her wonderfull transformation: For his eyes were so rauished with such exceeding pleasure, that his tongue could endure no longer silent but was forced to vnfold the secrets of his heart, and in these tearmes began to vtter his minde: Thou most diuine and singular ornament of nature, (sayd hee) fayrer then the feathers of the siluer Swannes, that swim vpon Maeanders Chrystal streames, & far more beautifull then Auroraes morning countenance, to thee the fairest of all faires, most humbly therefore to thy beautie do I onely submit my affections: Also I sweare by the Honour of my Knighthood, and by the loue of my Countrey France (which vow I will not violate for all the Treasures of rich America , nor the golden Mines of higher India ) Whether thou beest an Angell descended from the heauens, or a Furie ascended from the dominions of Proserpine : whether thou beest some Fayrie or Siluane Nymph, which inhabits in these fatall woods, or else an earthly creature, for thy sinnes transformed into this Mulberie tree, I may not iudge: Therefore, sweet Saint, in whom my heart must pay his deuotion, vnfold to mee thy birth, parentage, and name, that I may the bolder presume vpon thy courtesies. At which demand, this new-borne Uirgin with a shamefast looke, modest gesture, sober grace and blushing countenance, began thus to reply: Sir Knight, by whom my life, my loue, and fortunes are to be commanded, and by whome my humane shape and naturall forme is recouered: First know thou magnanimious Champion, that I am by birth the King of Thessalies Daughter, and my name was called for my beautie, proud Eglantine : For which contemptuous pride, I was transformed into this Mulberie tree; in which greene substance I haue continued fourteene yeeres; as for my loue, thou hast deserued it, before all other Knights in the world, and to thee do I plight that true promise before the Omnipotent Iudger of all things: and before that secret promise shall bee infringed, the Sunne shall cease to shine by day, and the Moone by night, & al ye planets forsake their proper natures. At which words the Champion gaue her the courtesie of his Countrey, and sealed her promises with a louing kisse. After which, the beautifull Eglantine : being ashamed of her nakednes, weaued her such a garment of greene rushes, intermixed with such varietie of sundry flowers, yt it surpassed for workemanship the Indian maidens curious webs: her crisped locks of haire continued still of the colour of the Mulberie tree: whereby she seemd like Flora in her greatest royaltie, when the fields were bedeckt with natures tapestrie. After which, she washed her Lillie hands, & Rosie coloured face in the dewes of heauen: which she gathered from a bed of violets. Thus in her greene vestiments, shee intends in companie of her true Loue (the valiant Knight of France ) to take her iournie to her Fathers Court, being as then the King of that Country: where after some few dayes trauell, they ariued safe in the Court of Thessalie : whose welcomes were to their owne wishes, and their entertainments most honourable: for no sooner did the King beholde his Daughters safe approch, of whose strange transformation, he was euer ignorant, but he fell into such a dead sound, through the exceeding ioy of her presence, that for a time his senses were without vitall moouing, and his heart imbraced so kindly her daintie body, and proffered such curtesie to the strange Knight, that Saint Dennis accounted him the mirrour of all curtesie, and the patterne of true Nobilitie. After the Champion was vnarmed, his stiffe and weary limmes were bathed in new milke and white wine, he was conuayed to a sweete smelling fire made of Iuniper, and the faire Eglantine conducted by the Maydens of Honour to a priuate chamber, where shee was disrobed of her Siluane attire, & apparelled in a Pall of purple silke: In which Court of Thessalie wee will leaue this our Champion of Fraunce with his Lady, and go forward in the discourses of the other Champions, discouering what aduentures hapned to them during the time of seuen yeeres: But first how Saint Iames the Champion of Spaine , fell in loue with a faire Iew , and how for her sake hee continued seuen yeeres dumbe, and after, if Apollo graunt my Muse the gift of Scholerisme , and dip my pen in the inke of Arte, I will not rest my wearie hand, till I haue explainde the Honourable proceedings of the Knights of England, France, Spaine, Italie, Scotland, Wales , and Ireland , to the Honour of Christendome, and the dishonour of all the professed enemies of Christ. How Saint Iames the Champion of Spaine, continued seuen yeeres dumbe for the loue of a faire Iew, and how hee should haue beene shot to death by the Maidens of Ierusalem; with other things which chanced in his trauels. Now must my Muse speake of the strange aduentures of Saint Iames of Spaine , the third Champion and renowmed Knight of Christendome, and what hapned vnto him in his seuen yeeres trauailes through many a strange countrey, both by sea and land, where his honourable actes were so dangerous and full of wonder, that I want memorie to expresse, and arte to subscribe: also I am forced for breuities sake, to passe ouer his fearefull and dangerous battaile with the burning Drake vpon the flaming mount in Sicill , which terrible combat continued for the space of seuen dayes and seuen nights. Likewise I omit his trauaile in Capadocia , through a wildernesse of monsters: with his passage ouer the red seas, where his ship was deuoured with wormes, his Marriners drowned, and himselfe, his horse and furniture safely brought to land by the sea-nimphes and Mermaides: where, after his long trauels, passed perils, and dangerous tempests, amongst the boystreous billowes of the raging seas, he ariued in the vnhappy dominions of Iuda , vnhappy, by reason of the long and troublesome miserie hee indured, for the loue of a faire Iew. For comming to the beautifull cittie Ierusalem , (being in that age the wonder of the world; for braue buildings, princely pallaces, gorgeous mountaines and time-woondring Temples) he so admired the glorious situation thereof, (being the richest place that euer his eyes beheld) that hee stoode before the walles of Ierusalem , one while gazing vpon her golden gates glistring against the Sunnes bright countenance, another while beholding her stately Pinnacles, whose loftie peering toppes seemed to touch the clouds; another while wondring at her towers of Iasper, Iet, and Ebonie, her strong and fortified walles three times doubled about the Cittie, the glistring spires of the Temples of Sion built in the fashion and similitude of two Piramides the auncient monument of Greece , whose battlements were couered with steele, the walles burnished with siluer, and the ground paued with tinne. Thus as this enabled and famoused Knight at armes stood beholding the situation of Ierusalem , there sodainely thundred such a peale of Ordinance within the Cittie, that it seemed in his rauished conceit, to shake the vales of heauen, and to mooue the deepe foundations of the fastned earth: whereat his horse gaue such a sodaine start, that he leapt fortie foote from the place whereon he stood. After this he heard the chearefull sound of Drums, and the ecchoes of brazen Trumpets, by which the good Champion expected some honourable pastime, or some great turnament to be at hand, which indeede so fell out: for no sooner did he cast his vigilant eyes toward the East side of the Cittie, but he beheld a troope of well appointed horse come marching through the gates: after them twelue armed Knights mounted on warlike Coursers, bearing in their handes twelue bloud red streamers, whereon was wrought in silke, the picture of Adonis wounded with a Bore: after them the King drawne in a Charriot of Spanish Iennets, (which be a certaine kind of Steeds engendred by the wind. (The Kings Gard were a hundred naked Moores, with Turkish bowes and darts, feathered with Rauens quilles: after them marched Celestine , the King of Ierusalems faire Daughter, mounted on a tame Unycorne, in her hand a Iauelin of siluer, and armed with a brest- plate of Gold, artificially wrought like the skales of a Porcupine, her Gard were an hundred Amazonian Dames clad in greene silke: after them followed a number of Squires and Gentlemen, some vpon Barbarian Steeds, some vpon Arabian Palfrayes, and some on foote, in pace more nimbler then the tripping Deere, & more swifter then the tamelesse Harts vpon the mountaines of Thessalie . Thus Nabuzaradan , great king of Ierusalem (for so was he called,) solemnely hunted in the wildernesse of Iuda , being a countrey very much annoyed with wilde beasts, as the Lyon, the Leopard, the Bore, and such like. In which exercise the King appointed, as it was proclaimed by his cheife Harrold at Armes, (the which he heard repeated by a sheepheard in the fieldes,) that whosoeuer slewe the first wilde beast in the Forrest, should haue in reward a corslet of steele so richly ingraued, that it should be worth a thousand fickles of siluer. Of which honourable enterprise when the Champion had vnderstanding, and with what liberall bountie the aduenturous Knights should bee rewarded, his heart was fraughted with inuincible courage, thirsting after glorious attempts, not onely for hope of gaine, but for the desire of honour. At which his illustrious and vndaunted minde aymed at, to eternize his deedes in the memorable records of Fame, and to shine as a Chrystall mirrour to all insuing times. So closing downe his beuer, & locking on his furniture, scoured ouer the plaines before the hunters of Ierusalem , in pace more swifter then the winged winds, till hee approched an olde, solitarie, and vnfrequented Forrest, wherein he espied a huge and mightie wilde Bore lying before his mossie den, gnawing vpon the mangled ioynts of some passenger, which hee had murthered as hee trauayled through the Forrest. This Bore was of a wonderfull length and bignesse, and so terrible to behold, that at the first sight, hee almost daunted the courage of this Spanish Knight: for his monstrous head seemed vgly and deformed, his eyes sparkled like a firie furnace, his tuskes more sharpe then pikes of steele, and from his nostrels fumed such a violent breath, that it seemed like a tempestuous whirle-winde, his bristles were more harder then seuen times melted brasse, and his tayle more loathsome then a wreath of Snakes: neere whome when Saint Iames approched, and beheld how he dranke the blood of humane creatures, and deuoured their flesh, hee blew his siluer horne, which as then hung at the pummell of his saddle in a scarfe of greene silke: whereat the furious monster rouzed himselfe, and most fiercely assayled the Noble Champion, which most nimbly leaped from his horse, and with his speare stroke such a violent blow against the brest of the Bore, that it shiuered into twentie pieces. Then drawing his good Fauchion from his side, gaue him a second encounter: but all in vaine, for he stroke as it were on a Rocke of stone, or a piller of Iron, nothing hurtfull to the Bore: but at last with staring eyes (which sparkled like burning steele,) and with open iawes the greedie monster assayled the Champion, intending to swallow him aliue: but the nimble knight as then trusted more vppon pollicie then to fortitude, and so for aduantage skipped from place to place, till on a suddaine he thrust his keene edged Curtle-axe downe his intestine throat, and so most valiantly split his heart in sunder. The which being accomplished to his owne desires, he cut off the Bores head, and so presented the honour of his Combat to the King of Ierusalem , who as then with his mightie traine of knights, were but now entered the Forrest: but hauing gratiously accepted the gift, and bountifully fulfilled his promises, demaunded the Champions countrey, his religion and place of natiuitie. Who no sooner had intelligence that he was a Christian knight, and borne in the territories of Spaine , but presently his patience exchanged into extreme furie, and by these wordes hee expressed his cankered stomacke towardes the Christian Champion: Knowest thou not, bold Knight (sayd the king of Ierusalem ) that it is the law of Iuda , to harbour no vncircumcised man, but either banish him the land, or end his dayes by some vntimely death? Thou art a Christian, and therefore shalt thou die: not all thy countries treasure, the wealthie Spanish mines, nor if all the Alpes which diuide the countries of Italie and Spaine , were turned to hilles of burnisht gold, and made my lawfull heritage, they should not redeeme thy life. Yet for the honour thou hast done in Iuda , I grant thee this loue, by the law of Armes to choose thy death, els hadst thou suffered a timorous torment. Which seuere iudgement so amazed the Champion, that desperately hee woulde haue gorgde himselfe vppon his owne sword, but that hee thought it an honour to his countrie to die in the defence of Christendome. So like a true innobled knight, fearing neither the threats of the Iewes, nor the impartiall stroke of the fatall Sisters, he gaue this sentence of his owne death. First he requested to be bound to a pine tree with his brest layd open naked against the Sunne: then to haue an houres respite to make his supplication to his Creator, and afterwardes to be shot to death by a pure virgin. Which words were no sooner pronounced, but they disarmed him of his furniture, bound him to a Pine tree, and layd his brest open, readie to entertaine the bloudy stroke of some vnrelenting mayden: but such pittie, meeke mercie, and kinde lenitie lodged in the heart of euery mayden, that none would take in hand to bee the bloudy executioner of so braue a knight. At last, the tyrannous Nabuzaradan gaue strickt commandement vpon paine of death, that lots should be cast among the maydens of Iuda that were there present, and to whom the lot did fall, should bee the fatall executioner of the condemned Champion. But by fortune the chaunce fell to Celestine the kings owne daughter, beeing the Parragon of beautie, and the fayrest mayde then liuing in Ierusalem , in whose heart no such deede of crueltie could bee harboured, nor in whose hand no bloudy weapon could be entertayned. In stead of deaths fatall instrument, shee shot towards his brest a deepe strained sigh, the true messenger of loue, and afterward to heauen shee thus made her humble supplication: Thou great Commander of celestiall mouing powers, conuert the cruell motions of my fathers minde, into a spring of pitifull teares, that they may wash away the bloud of this innocent knight, from the habitation of his stained purple soule. O Iuda and Ierusalem ! within whose bosomes liues a wildernesse of Tygers, degenerate from natures kinde, more cruell then the hungry Canibals, and more obdurate then vntamed Lyons: what mercilesse Tyger can vnrip that brest, where liues the image of true Nobility, the very patterne of Knight- hood, and the map of a Noble mind? No, no, before my handes shall bee stayned with Christians bloud, I will like Scilla , against all nature, sell my countries safetie, or like Maedea wander with the golden Fleece to vnknowne Nations. Thus, and in such maner complained the beautious Celestine , the Kings daughter of Ierusalem , till her sighes stopped the passage of her speech, and her teares stayned the naturall beautie of her Rosie cheekes her hayres which glistered like to golden wiers, shee besmerde in dust, and disrobed her selfe from her costly garments, and then with a traine of her Amazonian ladies, went to the king her father, where after a long suite, shee not onely obtainde his life, but libertie, yet therewithall his perpetuall banishment from Ierusalem , and from all the borders of Iuda , the want of whose sight more greeued her heart, then the losse of her owne life. So this noble and prayse-worthie Celestine returned to the Christian Champion, that expected euery minute to entertaine the sentence of death, but his expectation fell out contrary: for the good Lady after she had sealed two or three kisses vppon his pale lips, beeing exchanged through the feare of death, cut the bands that bound his bodie to the tree, in an hundred peeces, and then with a floud of salt teares, the motions of true loue, shee thus reuealed her minde: Most noble Knight, and true Champion of Christendome, thy life and libertie I haue gainde, but therewithall thy banishment from Iuda , which is a hell of horror to my soule: for in thy bosome haue I built my happinesse, and in thy heart I account the Paradice of my true loue: thy first sight and louely countenance did so rauish mee, when these eyes beheld thee mounted on thy princely Palfray, that euer since, my heart hath burned in affection: therefore, deare Knight, in reward of my loue, bee thou my Champion, and for my sake weare this ring with this posie ingrauen in it, Ardeo affectione : and so giuing him a ring from her finger, and there withall a kisse from her mouth, she departed with a sorrowfull sight, incompanie of her Father and the rest of his honourable traine, backe to the Cittie of Ierusalem , beeing as then neere the setting of the Sunne. But now Saint Iames the Champion of Spaine , hauing passed the danger of death, and at full libertie to depart from that vnhappie nation, hee fell into a hundred cogitations, one while thinking vpon the true loue of Celestine , (whose name as yet hee was ignorant of,) another while vpon the crueltie of her Father: then intending to depart into his owne countrey, but looking backe to the Towers of Ierusalem , his mind suddenly altered, for thither he purposed to go, hoping to haue a sight of his Lady and Mystris, and to liue in some disguised sort in her presence, and bee her loues true Champion against all commers. So gathering certaine blacke-beries from the trees, hee coloured his body all ouer like a Blackamore: but yet considering that his speech would discouer him, intended likewise to continue dumbe all the time of his residence in Ierusalem . So all things ordered according to his desire, hee tooke his iourney to the cittie, where with signes and other motions of dumbenesse, hee declared his intent, which was to be entertained in the court, and to spend his time in the seruice of his King. But when the king beheld his countenance, which seemed of the naturall colour of the Moore, hee little mistrusted him to be the Christian Champion, whom before hee greatly enuied, but accounted him one of the brauest Indian Knights that euer his eyes behelde: therefore hee installed him with the honour of Knight-hood, and appointed him to bee one of his Gard, and likewise his Daughters onely Champion. But when Saint Iames of Spaine sawe himselfe inuested in that honoured place, his soule was rauished with such exceeding ioy, that hee thought no pleasure comparable to his, no place of Elisium but the Court of Ierusalem , and no goddesse but his beloued Celestine . Long continued hee dumbe, casting foorth many a louing sigh in the presence of his Lady and Mistresse, not knowing how to reueale the secrets of his minde. So vpon a time, there ariued in the Court of Nabuzaradan , the King of Arabia , with the Admirall of Babylon , both presuming vpon the loue of Celestine , and crauing her in the way of marriage: but shee exempted all motions of loue from her chaste minde onely building her thoughts vpon the Spanish Knight, which she supposed to be in his own Countrey. At whose malancholy passions, her importunate sutors, the King of Arabia , and the Admirall of Babylon marueiled: and therefore intended vpon an euening to present her with some rare deuised maske. So choosing out fit consorts for their courtly pastimes, of which number the King of Arabia was cheife and first leader of the traine, the great Admirall of Babylon was the second, and her owne Champion Saint Iames , the third, who was called in the Court by the name of the dumbe Knight, and in this maner the maske was performed: First entred a most excellent consort of Musicke, after them the aforesaid Maskers in cloth of gold, most curiously imbroydered, and daunced a course about the hall, at the end whereof, the king of Arabia presented Celestine with a costly sword, at the hilt whereof hung a siluer Globe, and vpon the point was erected a golden crowne: then the Musicke sounded an other course, of which the Admirall of Babylon was leader, who presented her with a vesture of purple silke, of the colour of the rainebowe, brought in by Diana, Venus , and Iuno : which beeing done, the musicke sounded the third time, in which course Saint Iames (though vnknowne) was the leader of the daunce, who at the ende thereof likewise presented Celestine with a garland of Flowers, which was brought in by the three Graces, and put vpon her head. Afterward the Christian Champion intending to discouer himselfe vnto his Lady and Mistresse, tooke her by the seemely hand, and led her a stately Morisco, dance, which being no sooner finished, but he offered her the Diamond ring which she gaue him at his departure in the woods, the which she presently knew by the posie, and shortly after had intelligence of his long continued dumbnesse, his counterfeit colour, his changing of nature, and the great danger that hee put himselfe in for her sake: which caused her with all the speede shee could possible make, to breake off company, and to retire into a Cabinet which shee had hard by, where the same euening she had a long conference with her true and faithfull louer and aduenturous Champion: and to conclude, they made such agreement betwixt them, that the same night, vnknowne to any in the Court, shee bade Ierusalem adue, and by the light of Cinthias glistering beames, stole from her fathers Pallace, where, in company of none but Saint Iames , she tooke her iourney toward the countrey of Spaine . But this noble Knight, by pollicie preuented all insuing dangers, for hee shodde his horse backewards, whereby when they were missed in the Court, they might be followed the contrary way. By this meanes escaped the two louers from the fury of the Iewes, and ariued safely in Spaine in the citie of Ciuill , wherein the good Champion Saint Iames was borne: where as now, wee leaue them for a time to their owne contented mindes. Also passing ouer the hurly burly in Ierusalem for the losse of Celestine , the vaine pursuits of aduenturous Knights, in stopping the Ports and Hauens, the preparing of fresh horses to follow them, and the mustring of souldiers to pursue them, the franticke passions of the King for his daughter, the malancholy mones of the Admirall of Babylon for his Mistresse, and the wofull lamentation of the Arabian King, for his Ladie and loue: wee will returne to the aduentures of the other Christian Champions. The terrible battell betwixt S. Anthonie the Champion of Itaile, and the Gyant Blanderon; and afterward of his strange entertainment in the Gyants Castell, by a Thracian Ladie, and what hapned to him in the same Castell. It was at that time of the yeere, when the earth was newly deckt with a Summers liuerie, when the noble & heroical minded Champion S. Anthonie of Italie ariued in Thrasia , where hee spent his seuen yeeres trauels to ye honour of his Countrey, the glory of God, and to his owne lasting memorie: For after he had wandred through many a wearisome way, both by Sea and Land, through woods and wildernesses, by hilles and dales, by caues and dennes, and other vnknowne passages, hee ariued at last vpon the top of an high and steepie mountaine, whereon stood a wonderfull huge and strong Castell, which was kept by the most mightiest Gyant vnder the cope of heauen, whose puissant force all Thrasia could not ouercome, nor once attempt to withstand, but with the danger of their whole Countrey. The Gyants name was Blanderon , his Castell of the purest marble stone, his gates of yellow brasse, and ouer the principall gate was graued in letters of gold, these verses following. Within this Castell liues the scourge of Kings, A furious Gyant, whose vnconquered power, The Thracian Monarch to subiection brings, And keepes his Daughters prisoners in his Tower: Seuen Damsels faire the monstrous Gyant keepes, That sing him musicke while he nightly sleepes. His bats of steele a thousand Knights haue felt, Which for these Virgins sakes haue lost their liues: For all the Champions bold that with him dealt, This most intestine Gyant still suruiues: Let simple Passengers take heede in time, When vp this steepie mountaine they doe clime. But Knights of worth, and men of Noble minde, If any chance to trauell by this Tower: That for these Maydens sakes will be so kinde, To try their strengths against the Gyants power, Shall haue a Virgins prayer both day and night, To prosper them with good successefull fight. After he had read what was written ouer the gate, desire of Fame so encouraged him, and the thirst of honour so imboldened his valiant minde, that he either vowed to redeeme the Ladies from their seruitude, or die with honour by the furie of the Gyant. So going to the Castell gate, he stroke so vehemently thereon with the pummell of his sword, that it sounded like a mightie thunder- clap: Whereat Blanderon sodainely started vp, being fast a sleepe close by a fountaines side, and came pacing foorth at the Gate with a mightie Oke vpon his necke: which at the sight of the Italian Champion, so lightly flourished it about his head, as though it had beene but a light Dimmilaunce, and with these words gaue the noble Champion entertainement: What furie hath incenst thy ouer-boldened mind (proude Princockes) thus to aduenture thy feeble force, against the violence of my strong arme? I tell thee, haddest thou the strength of Hercules , who bore the mountaine Atlas on his shoulders, or the pollicie of Vlisses , by which the Cittie of Troy was ruinated, or the might of Xerxes , whose multitudes drunke huge riuers as they passed: yet all to feeble, weake, and impotent, to encounter with the mightie Giant Blanderon : thy force I esteeme like a blast of wind, and thy strokes as light as a fewe drops of water: Therefore betake the to thy weapon, which I compare vnto a Bul-rush for on this ground will I measure out thy graue, and after cast thy feeble Palfray, in one of my hands headlong downe this steepie mountaine. Thus boasted the vaine glorious Giant, vpon his owne strength. During which time, the vallorous and hardie Champion had alighted from his horse, where, after hee had made his humble supplication to the heauens for his good speede, and committed his Fortune to the impartiall Queene of destinie, hee approched within the compasse of the Giants reach, who with his great Oke so nimbly besturde him with such vehement blowes, that they seemed to shake the earth, and to rattle against the walles of the Castell like mightie thunder-claps: and had not the politike knight continually skipped from the furie of his blow, hee had beene brused as small as flesh vnto the pot, for euery stroke that the Gyant gaue, the roote of his Oke entered at the least two or three foote deepe into the ground. But such was the wisedome and pollicie of the worthy Champion, not to withstand the force of his weapon, till the Gyant grew breathlesse, and not able through his long labour to lift the Oke aboue his heade, and likewise the heate of the Sunne was so intollerable (by reason of the extreme height of the Mountaine, and the mightie weight of his Iron coate) that the sweat of the Gyants browes ran into his eyes, and by the reason that hee was so extreame fatte, he grew blinde, that hee coulde not see to endure Combat with him any longer, and as farre as hee coulde perceiue, woulde haue retyred or runne backe againe, into his Castell; but that the Italian Champion with a bolde courage assayled the Gyant so fiercely, that he was forced to let his Oke fall, and stand gasping for breath: which when the Noble Knight beheld, with a fresh supply hee redoubled his blowes so couragiously, that they battered on the Gyants Armour like a storme of winters hayle. whereby at last Blanderon was compelled to aske the Champion mercie, and to craue at his hands some respite of breathing, but his demaund was in vaine, for the valiant Knight supposed now or neuer to obtaine the honour of the day, and therefore neuer rested his wearie arme, but redoubled blow after blow till the Gyant for want of breath, and through the anguish of his deepe gashed woundes, was forced to giue the worlde a farewell, and to yeelde the riches of his Castle to the most renowned Conquerour S. Anthonie the Champion of Italie: But by that time the long and dangerous encounter was finished, & the Gyant Blanderons head disseuered from his bodie, the Sunne sate mounted on the highest parte of the Elements, which caused the day to be extreame hote and sultrie, whereby the Champions Armour so extreamely scalded him that he was constrained to vnbrace his Corslet, and to lay aside his Burgonet, and to cast his body on the colde earth, onely to mittigate his ouer-burthened heate. But such was the vnnaturall coolenesse of the earth, and so vnkindly to his ouer labored heart, that the melted grease of his inward parts was ouer-cooled sodainely, whereby his body receiued such vnnaturall distemperature, that the vapors of the cold earth stroke presently to his heart, by which his vitall ayre of life was excluded, and his body without sense or mouing: where in the mercie of pale death, he lay bereaued of feeling for the space of an houre. During which time fayre Rossalinde (one of the Daughters of the Thracian King, beeing as then prysoner in the Castell,) by chance looked ouer the walles, and espied the body of the Gyant headlesse, vnder whose subiection she had continued in great seruitude for the time of seuen monethes; likewise by him a Knight vnarmed, as shee thought, panting for breath, the which the Lady iudged to be the knight that had slayne the Gyant Blanderon , and the man by whom her deliuery should be recouered, shee presently descended the walles of the Castell, and ran with all speede to the aduenturous Champion, whom she found dead: But yet being nothing discouraged of his recouerie, feeling as yet a warme bloud in euery member, retyred backe with all speede to the Castle, and fetcht a boxe of precious Balme, the which the Gyant was wont to poure into his wounds after his encounter with any knight: with which Balme this curteous Lady chafed euery part of the breathlesse Champions bodie, one while washing his stiffe lims with her salt teares the which like pearles fell from her eyes, another while drying them with the tresses of her golden hayre, which hung dangling in the wind, then chafing his liuelesse body againe with a Balme of a contrarie nature, but yet no signe of life could she espie in the dead Knight: which caused her to grow desperate of all hope of his recouerie: Therefore like a louing, meeke, and kind Ladie, considering hee had lost his life for her sake, shee intended to beare him companie in death, and with her owne hands to finish vp her dayes, and to dye vpon his brest, as Thisbie died vpon the brest of her true Pyrramus: therefore as the Swanne sings a while before her death, so this sorrowfull Lady warbled forth this Swanlike song ouer the bodie of the Noble Champion. Muses, come mourne with dolefull melodie, Kind Siluane Nimphes that sit in Rosie bowers: With brackish teares commixe your harmonie, To wayle with me both minutes, moneths and houres. A heauie, sad, and Swan-like song sing I, To ease my heart a while before I die. Dead is the Knight, for whom I liue and die, Dead is the Knight, which for my sake is slaine: Dead is the Knight, for whom my carefull crie, With wounded soule, for euer shall complaine. A heauie, sad, and Swan-like song sing I, To ease my heart a while before I die. Ile set my brest vpon a siluer streame, And swim vnto Elisium lilly fields: There in Ambrosian trees Ile write a theame, Of all the wofull sighes my sorrow yeeldes. A heauie, sad, and Swan-like song sing I, To ease my heart a while before I die. Farewell faire words, where sing the Nightingales, Farewell faire fields, where feed the lightfoote Does, Farewell you groues, you hils, and flowery dales, But fare thou ill the cause of all my woes: A heauie, sad, and Swan-like song sing I, To ease my heart a while before I die. Ring out my ruth, you hollow Caues of stone, Both birds, and beastes, with all things on the ground: You sencelesse trees, b'assistant to my mone, That vp to heauen my sorrowes may resound: A heauie, sad, and Swan-like song sing I, To ease my heart a while before I die. Let all the townes of Thrace ring out my knell, And write in leaues of brasse what I haue said: That after ages may remember well, How Rosalinde both liu'd and dide a maide: A heauie, sad, and swan-like song sing I, To ease my heart awhile before I die. This wofull dittie being no sooner ended, but the desperate Ladie vnsheathed the Champions sword, which as yet was all besprinkled with the Gyants bloud, and being at the verie point to execute her intended Tragedie, and the bloudy weapon directly placed against her Iuorie brest, shee heard the distressed Knight giue a grieuous and terrible grone: whereat shee stopped her remorseles hand, and with more discretion tendered her owne safetie: for by this time the Balme where with shee anoynted his body, by wonderfull operation recouered the dead Champion, insomuch that after some few gaspes and earnest sighes, hee raised vp his stiffe limmes from the cold earth, where like one cast into a trance, for a time gazed vp and downe the mountaine: but at the last hauing recouered his lost senses, espied the Thracian damsell stand by, not able to speake one word, her ioy so abounded: But after some continuance of time, he reuealed to her the maner of his daungerous encounter, and successefull victorie, and shee the cause of his recouerie, and her intended Tragedie. Where, after many kind salutations, shee courteously tooke him by the hand, and led him into the Castle, where for that night hee lodged his wearie lims in an easie bed stuffed with turtle feathers, and softest thistle downe, the Chamber had as many windowes where he lay, as there were dayes in the yeare, and as many doores as there were minutes in a day: and to describe the curious architecture and the artificiall workmanship of the place, were too tedious and a worke without end. But to bee short, the noble minded Knight slept soundly after his dangerous battaile, without mistrust of treason, or such rebellious cogitations, till golden Phoebus bade him good morrow. Then rising from his slouthfull bed, he attired himselfe, not in his wonted habilliments of warre, but in purple garments according to the time of peace, and so intended to ouer view the Nobilities of the Castle: But the Ladie Rossalinde all the night was busied in looking to his horse, preparing delicates for his repast, and in making a fire against his vprising, where after hee had refreshed his wearie spirites, with a daintie banket, and caroused downe two or three bowles of Greekish wines, he after by the counsell of Rossalinde , stripped the Giant from his yron furniture, and left his naked body vpon a craggie Rocke, to be deuoured of hungrie Rauens: which being done, the Thracian Uirgin discouered all the secrets of the Castle to the aduenturous Champion: First shee led him to a leaden tower: where hung a hundred well approoued Corslets, with other Martiall furniture, which were the spoyles of such knights as hee had violently slaine: after that, shee brought him to a stable, wherein stood a hundred pampered Iades, which daily fed vpon nothing but humane flesh: Against it was directly placed the Gyantes owne lodging, his bedde was of yron, corded with mightie bars of steele, the testerne and couering of carued brasse, the curtaines were of leaues of gold, and the rest of a strange and wonderfull substance, of the colour of the Elements: after this, she led him to a broad pond of water, more clearer then quicke siluer, the streames whereof lay continually as smooth as Chrystall, whereon swamme sixe milke white Swannes with crownes of gold about their neckes. O here, sayd the Thracian Lady, begins the hell of all my greife. At which words a pearled shewre of teares ran from the conduites of her eyes, that for a time they stayde the passage of her tongue: but hauing discharged her heart from a few sorrowfull sighes, she began in this maner to tell her passed fortunes: These sixe milke-white Swans, most honourable knight, you behold swimming in this riuer (quoth the Lady Rossalinde ) be my naturall sisters, both by birth and bloud, and all daughters to the King of Thrace , beeing now Gouernour of this vnhappie countrey, and the beginning of our imprisonment befell in this vnfortunate maner: The King my father, ordained a solemne hunting, to bee holden through the land, in which honourable pastime my selfe in companie of my sixe sisters was present. So in the middle of our sportes, when the Lords and Barrons of Thracia were in chase after the mightie shee Lyon, the heauens suddenly began to lowre, the firmaments ouercast, and a generall darkenesse ouerspred the face of the whole earth: then presently rose such a storme of lightning and thunder, as though heauen and earth had met together: by which our mightie troupes of Knights and Barrons were seperated one from another, and wee poore Ladyes forced by misfortune to seeke for shelter vnder the bottome of this high and steepie mountaine: where, when this cruell Gyant Blanderon espied vs, as hee walked vpon his battlements, suddenly descended the mountaine, and fetcht vs all vnder his arme, vp into his Castle, where euer since wee haue liued in great seruitude: and for the wonderfull transformation of my sixe sisters, thus it came to passe, as followeth. Upon a time, the Gyant being ouer charged with wine, grewe enamoured vpon our beauties, and desired much to enioy the pleasures of our virginities, our excellent gifts of nature so enflamed his minde with lust, that hee would haue forced vs euery one to satisfie his sinfull desires: but as he tooke my sisters one by one into his lodging, thinking to deflowre them their earnest prayers so preuailed in the sight of God that he preserued their chastities by a most strange and wonderfull miracle, and turned their comely bodyes into the shape of milke-white Swannes, euen in the same forme as here you see them swimming. So when this monstrous Gyant saw that his intent was crost, and howe there was none left behind to supply his want, but my vnfortunate selfe, hee restrained his filthie lust, not violating my honour with any staine of infamie, but kept mee euer since a most pure virgin, onely with sweet inspiring musick to bring him to his sleepe. Thus haue you heard (most Noble Knight) the true discourse of my most vnhappy fortunes, and the wonderfull transformation of my sixe sisters, whose losse to this day is greatly lamented throughout all Thrace : and with that word shee made an end of her tragicall discourse, not able to vtter the rest for weeping. Whereat ye Knight being oppressed then with like sorrowe, imbraced her about the slender waste, and thus kindly began to comfort her: My moost deare and kinde Ladie, within whose countenance, I see how vertue is inthronized, and in whose minde liues true magnanimitie, let these few words suffice to comfort thy sorrowful cogitations. First thinke that the heauens are most beneficiall vnto thee, in preseruing thy chastitie from the Gyants insatiate desires: then for thy deliuery by my meanes from thy slauish seruitude: thirdly and lastly, that thou remaining in thy naturall shape & likenesse, mayest liue to bee the meanes of thy sisters transformations: Therefore dry vp these chrystall pearled teares, and bid thy long continued sorrowes adue: for greife is companion with despaire, and despaire a procurer of infamous death. Thus the wofull Thracian Ladie was comforted by the noble Christian Champion: where, after a fewe kinde greetings, they intended to trauayle to her Fathers Court, there to relate, what had hapned to her Sisters in the Castle, likewise the Gyants confusion, and her owne safe deliuerie, by the illustrious prowesse of the Christian Knight. So taking the keyes of the Castle, which were of a wonderfull waight, they locked vp the gates, and paced hande in hande, downe the steepie mountaine, till they approched the Thracian Court, which was distant from the Castle some tenne miles: but by that time they had a sight of the Pallace, the Sunne was wandred to the vnder world, and the light of heauen sate muffled vp in cloudes of pitch, the which not a little discontented the wearie trauellers: but at last comming to her Fathers gates, they heard a solemne sound of belles, ringing the funerall knell of some noble Estate: the cause of which solemne ringing, they demaunded of the Porter, who in this manner expressed the truth of the matter vnto them: Fayre Ladie, and most renowned Knight, (sayd the Porter) for so you seeme, both by your speeches and honourable demaunds, the cause of this ringing is, for the losse of the Kings seuen Daughters, the number of which Belles be seuen, called after the name of the seuen Princesses, which neuer yet hath ceased their dolefull melodie, since the departure of the vnhappie Ladies, nor neuer must, vntill ioyfull newes be heard of their safe returne. Then now their taskes be ended, (sayd the noble minded Rossalinde ) for wee bring happie newes of the seuen Princesses abidings. At which words, the Porter being rauished with ioy, in all haste ranne to the Steeple, and caused the Belles to cease. Whereas, the King of Thrace beeing at his Royall supper, and hearing the Belles to cease their wonted melodie, suddenly started vp from his Princely seate, and like a man amazed ran to the Pallace gate, where as hee found his daughter Rossalinde in companie of a strange Knight: which when he beheld, his ioy so exceeded, that he swooned in his daughters bosome, but beeing recouered to his former sence, he brought them both vp into his Princely Hall, where their entertainements were so honourable, and so gratious in the eyes of the whole Court, that it were too tedious and ouerlong to describe: but their ioy continued but a short season, for it was presently dasht with Rossalindes tragicall discourse: for the good old king, when hee heard of his daughters transformations, and how they liued in the shape of milke-white Swans, he rent his lockes of siluer hayre, which time had died with the pledge of wisedome: his rich and imbroydred garmentes he tore into a thousand peices, and clad his aged limmes in a dismall blacke, and sable mantle, more discontented then the wofull King of Troy , when he beheld his owne sonnes by the hayre of the heads dragged vp and downe the streets: also he commanded, that his Knights & aduenturous Champions, in stead of glistering Armour, should weare the weeds of death, more blacke in hiew then winters darkest nights, and all the courtly Ladies and gallant Thracian maydens, in stead of silken vestments, he commanded to weare both heauie, sad, and melancholy ornaments, and euen as vnto a solemne funerall, so to attend him to the Gyants castell; and there obsequiously to offer vp vnto the angry destinies, many a bitter sigh and teare, in remembrance of his transformed daughters. Which decree of the sorrowfull Thracian King was performed with all conuenient speed: for the next morning no sooner had Phoebus cast his beautie vnto the Kings bed-chamber, but he apparelled himselfe in mourning garments, and in companie of his melancholy traine, set forward to his wofull Pilgrimage. But now wee must not forget the Princely minded Champion of Italie , nor the noble Lady Rossalinde , who at the Kings departure towards the Castell, craued leaue to stay behinde, and not so sodaynely to begin a newe trauell: whereunto the King quickly condiscended, considering their late iourney the euening before: so taking the Castell keyes from the Champion, he bade his Pallace adieu, and committed his fortune to his sorrowfull iourney: where wee leaue him in a worlde of discontented passions, and a while discourse what hapned to the Christian Champion and his beloued Lady: for by that time the Sunne had thrise measured the world with his restles Steedes, and thrise his Sister Luna wandred to the West, the Noble Italian Knight grewe weary of his long continued rest, and thought it a great dishonour and a scandall to his valiant minde, to remayne where nought but Chamber sports were resident, & desired rather to abide in a Court that entertainde the dolefull murmuring of tragedies, where the ioyfull sound of Drummes and Trumpets should bee heard: therefore he tooke Rossalinde by the hand, being then in a dumpe for the want of her father, to whom the good Knight in this manner expressed his secret intent: My most deuoted Lady and Mistris (sayd the Champion) a second Dido for thy loue, a staine to Venus for thy beautie, Penelopes compare for constancie, and for chastitie the wonder of all maydes: the faithfull loue that hitherto I haue found since my arriuall, for euer shall be shrined in my heart, and before all ladies vnder the cope of heauen, thou shalt liue and die my loues true goddesse: and for thy sake Ile stand as Champion against all Knights in the world: But to impare the honour of my Knight-hood, and to liue like a carpet dancer in the laps of Ladies I will not: though I can tune a Lute in a Princes Chamber, I can sound as well a fierce alarum in the fielde: honour calles mee foorth, deare Rossalinde , and fame intends to buckle on my armour, which now lies rusting in the idle Court of Thrace : Therefore I am constrayned (though most vnwilling) to leaue the comfortable sight of thy beautie, and commit my fortune to a longer trauell: but I protest, wheresoeur I become, or in what Region soeuer I bee harboured, there will I maintaine to the losse of my life, that both thy loue, constancie, beauty, and chastitie, surpasseth all Dames aliue: and with this promise, my most diuine Rossalinde , I bid thee fare-well. But before the honourable minded Champion could finish what hee had purposed to vtter, the Lady beeing wounded inwardly with extreame greife, not able to indure to keepe silent any longer, but with teares falling from her eyes, brake off his speeches in this maner: Sir Knight (sayd shee) by whom my libertie hath beene obtayned: therefore the name of Ladie and Mistresse wherewith you intitle mee, is too high and proud a name, but rather call me handmaid, or seruile slaue, for on thy noble person will I euermore attend: It is not Thrace can harbour me when thou art absent, and before I doe forsake thy companie and kind fellowship, the heauen shall be no heauen, the sea no sea, nor the earth no earth: but if thou prouest vnconstant, as Ninus did to Scilla , who for his sake stole her fathers purple hayre, whereon depended the safety of his countrie, or like wandring Aeneas flie from the Queene of Carthage : yet shall these tender and soft hands of mine neuer bee vnclasped but hang vpon thy horse bridle, till my bodie like Thesius sons be dasht in sunder against hard flintie stones: Therfore forsake me not, deare knight of Christendome. If euer Camma was true to her Sinatus , or euer Alsione to her Ceyx so Rossalinde will be to thee: and with this plighted promise shee caught him fast about the necke, from whence shee would not vnclose her handes, till hee had vowde by the honour of true Cheualrie, to make her sole companion, and onely partner in his trauailes: and so after this order it was accomplished. Thus being both agreed, shee was most trimly attyred like a Page, in greene sarcenet, her hayre bound vp most cunningly with a silke list, and so artificially wrought with curious knots, that shee might trauayle without suspition or blemish of her honour: her rapier was a Turkish blade, and her ponyard of the finest fashion, the which shee wore at her backe tyed with an Orenge tawny coloured scarfe, beautified with tassels of vnwouen silke, her buskins of the smoothest kiddes skinnes, her spurres of the purest Lidian steele. In which when the noble and beautifull Lady was attyred, she seemed in stature like the god of loue, when he sate dandled vpon Didos lap, or rather Ganimede, Ioues minion, or Adonis , when Venus shewed her siluer skinne, to intrap his eyes to her vnchaste desires. But to be breife all things beeing get in readinesse for their departure from Thrace , this famous worthy Knight mounted vpon his eger Steede, and the magnanimious Rossalinde on her gentle Palfray, in pace more easier then the winged winds, or a Cock-boate floting vpon the chrystall streames, they both bade adue to the Countrey of Thracia , and committed their iourney to the Queene of chaunce: Therefore smile heauens, and guide them with a most happy Starre, vntill they arriue where their soules do most desire. The brauest and boldest Knight that euer wandred by the way, and the most loueliest Lady that euer eye beheld. In whose trauailes my Muse must leaue them for a season, and speake of the Thracian mourners, which by this time had watered the earth with abundance of their ceremonious teares, and made the elements true witnesses of their sadde laments, as hereafter followeth in this next Chapter. How Saint Andrew the Champion of Scotland trauailed into a vale of walking spirits, and how hee was set at libertie, by a going fire, after his iourney into Thracia, where hee recouered the sixe Ladies to their naturall shapes, that had liued seuen yeeres in the likenesse of milke-white Swannes, with other accidents that befell the most Noble Champion. Now of the honourable aduentures of Saint Andrew the famous Champion of Scotland must I discourse, whose seuen yeeres trauailes were as strange as any of the other Champions: For after hee had departed from the brazen Piller, as you heard in the beginning of the Historie, hee trauailed through many a strange and vnknowne Nation, beyond the circuit of the Sunne, where but one time in ye yeere she shewes her brightsome beames, but continually darkenes ouerspreads the country, and there is a kind of people that haue heads like dogs, and in extremitie of hunger do deuoure one another: from which people this Noble Champion was wonderfull strangely deliuered: for after he had wandred some certaine dayes, neyther seeing the gladsome brightnes of the Sunne, nor the comfortable countenance of the Moone, but onely guided by dusky palenes of the elements, he hapned to a vale of walking spirits: which he supposed to be the very dungeon of burning Acheron : for there he heard blowing of vnseene fires, boyling of furnaces, ratling of armour, trampling of horses, gingling of chaines, lumbring of tubs, roring of spirits, and such like horrible hearings, that it made the Scottish Champion almost at his wits ende: But yet hauing an vndaunted courage, exempting all feare, he humbly made his supplication to heauen, that God would deliuer him from that discontented place of terrour: and so presently as the Champion kneeled vpon the barren ground (wheron grew neither herbe, flower, grasse, nor any other greene thing,) hee beheld a certaine flame of fire walking vp and downe before him, whereat he grew into such an extasie of feare, that he stood for a time amazed whether it were best to goe forward, or to stand still: But yet recalling his sences, hee remembred himselfe, how hee had read in passed times of a going fire called Ignis fatuus , the fire of destinie, or some Will with the wispe, or Will with the lanthorne, and likewise by some simple country people, The faire maid of Ireland, which commonly vsed to leade wandring traueilers out of their wayes: The like imagination entered ye Champions mind. So encouraging himselfe with his owne conceites, and chearing vp his dull sences late oppressed with extreame feare, hee directly followed the going fire, which so iustly went before him, that by the time the guider of the night had climed twelue degrees in the Zodiacke, he was sefely deliuered from the vale of walking spirits, by the direction of the going fire. Now began the Sunne to daunce about the firmament, which hee had not seene in many months before: whereat his dull sences so much reioyced, being so long couered before with darkenesse, that euery step he troad was as pleasurable, as though he had walked in a garden bedeckt with all kind of fragrant flowers. At last without any further molestation, he ariued within the territories of Thracia , a countrie as you heard in the former Chapter, adorned with the beautie of many faire Woods and Forrests, through which he traueiled with small rest, but lesse sleepe, till hee came to the foote of the mountaine, whereupon stood the Castle wherein the wofull King of Thracia in companie of his sorrowfull subiectes, still lamented the vnhappie destinies of his sixe daughters turned into Swans, with Crownes of gold about their neckes. But when the valiant Champion Saint Andrew behelde the loftie situation of the Castle, and the inuincible strength it seemed to bee of, he expected some strange aduenture to befall him in the said Castell: So preparing his sword in readines, and buckling close his Armour, which was a shirt of siluer maile, for lightnesse in trauell, hee climed the Mountaine, whereupon he espied the Gyant lying vpon a craggie Rocke, with limmes and members all to be rent and torne, by the fury of hunger-starued fowles: which loathsome spectakle was no little woonder to the worthie Champion, considering the mightie stature and bignesse of the Gyant: So leauing his putrified body to the windes, hee approched the gates: where after hee had read the superscription ouer the same, without any interruption entred the Castell, where hee expected a fierce encounter by some Knight that should haue defended the same: but all thinges fell out contrary to his imagination, for after hee had found many a strange nouelty & hidden secrete closed in the same, he chanced at last to come where the Thracians duely obserued their ceremonious mournings, which in this order was dayly performed: for vpon Sundayes, which in that countrey is the first day in the weeke, all the Thracians attired themselues after the maner of Bacchus Priests, and burned perfumed incense, and sweet Arabian frankincense, vpon a religious shrine, which they offered to the Sunne, as cheife gouernour of that day, thinking thereby to appease the angrie destinies, and so recouer the vnhappie Ladies to their former shapes: vpon Mundayes clad in garments after the maner of Siluanes, and colour like to the waues of the Sea, they offered vp their wofull teares to the Moone being the guider and mistresse of that day: vpon Tuesdayes, like Souldiers trayling their Banners on the dust, and Drums sounding sad and dolefull mellodie, in signe of discontent, they committed their proceedings to the pleasure of Mars , being ruler & guider of ye day: vpon Wednesday, like scholers, vnto Mercurie : vpon Thursday, like Potentates, to Ioue : vpon Fridayes like louers with sweete sounding musicke to Venus : and vpon Satterdaies like manuall prolessors to the angry and discontented Saturne . Thus the wofull Thracian King, with his sorrowfull subiects, consumed seuen moneths away, one while accusing fortune of despite, another while the heauens of iniustice: the one for childrens transformations, the other for their long limited punishments. But at last, when the Scottish Champion heard, what bitter mone the Thracians made about the riuer, he demanded the cause, and to what purpose they obserued such vaine ceremonies, contemning the Maiestie of high Iehoua , and onely worshipping but outwarde and vaine Gods: to whom the King after a fewe sad teares strayned from the Conduits of his aged eyes, replied in this maner: Most noble Knight, for so you seeme, both by your gesture and other outward appearance, (quoth the King,) if you desire to know the cause of our continuall greife, prepare your eares to heare a tragicke and wofull tale, whereat I see the elements begin to mourne, and couer their azurde countenance, with sable cloudes. These milke-white Swannes you see, whose neckes bee beautified with golden Crownes, are my sixe naturall Daughters, transformed into this Swan-like substance, by the appointment of the Gods: for of late this Castell was kept by a cruell Giant named Blanderon , who by violence would haue rauished them: But the heauens, to preserue their chastities, preuented his lustfull desires, and transformed their beautifull features to those milke-white Swannes: And now seuen times the cheereful Spring hath renewed the earth with a Sommers liuerie; and seuen times the nipping Winter frostes haue bereaued the trees of leafe and bud, since first my Daughters lost their Uirgins shapes: Seuen Sommers haue they swomme vppon this Chrystall streame: where, in stead of rich attyre, and imbroidered Uestments, the smooth siluer coloured feathers adornes their comely bodies: Princely Pallaces, wherein they were wont, like vnto tripping Sea-nimphes, daunce their measures vp and downe, are now exchanged into cold streames of water: wherein their chiefest melodie, is the murmuring of the liquid bubbles, and their ioyfullest pleasure, to heare the harmonie of humming Bees, which the Poets call the Muses birdes. Thus haue you heard (most worthie Knight) the rufull tragedies of my daughters, for whose sakes I will spende the remnant of my dayes, chearefully complaining of their long appointed punishments, about the bankes of this vnhappie riuer. Which sad discourse being no sooner ended, but the Scottish Knight (hauing a mind furnished with all Princely thoughts, and a tongue washt in the Fountaine of eloquence,) thus replyed to the comfort and great reioycing of all the companie. Most noble King (quoth the Champion) your heauie and dolorous discourse hath constrained my heart to a wonderfull passion, and compelled my very soule to rue your daughters miseries: But yet a greater greife a deeper sorrow then that, hath taken possession in my brest, whereof my eies haue beene witnesse, and my eares vnhappie hearers of your misbeleife, I meane your vnchristian faith: For I haue seene, since my first arriuall into the same Castle, your prophane and vaine worshipping of strange and false Gods, as of Phoebus, Luna, Mars, Mercurie , and such like Poeticall names, which the maiestie of high Iehoua vtterly contemns but magnificent gouernour of Thracia , if you seeke to recouer your daughters happinesse by humble prayers, and to obtaine your soules content by true teares, you must abandon all such vaine ceremonies, and with true humilitie beleeue in the Christians God, which is the God of wonders, and cheife commaunder of the rouling elements, in whose quarrell this vndaunted arme, and this vnconquered heart of mine shall fight: and now be it knowne to thee, great king of Thrace , that I am a Christian Champion, and by byrth a Knight of Scotland, bearing my countries Armes vpon my brest (for indeede thereon hee bore a siluer Crosse set in blue silke) and therefore in the honour of Christendome I challenge forth thy proudest knight at armes, against whom I will maintaine, that our God is the true God, and the rest fantasticall and vaine ceremonies. Which sudden and vnexpected challenge, so daunted the Thracian Champions, that they stoode amazed for a time, gazing one vpon another, like men dropt from the cloudes: but at last consulting together, howe the challenge of the strange Knight, was to the dishonour of their Countrie, and vtter scandall of all knightly dignitie: therefore with a generall consent, they craued leaue of the King that the challenge might bee taken, who as willingly condiscended as they demaunded. So the time and place was appointed, which was the next morning following by the Kings commandement, vpon a large and plaine meadow close by the riuer side, whereon the sixe Swans were swimming: and so after the Christian Champion had cast downe his steely Gauntlet, and the Thracian knights accepted thereof, euerie one departed for that night; the challenger to the East side of the Castle to his lodging, and the defendants to the West, where they slept quietly till the next morning, who by the breake of day were wakened by a Harold at Armes: but all the passed night our Scottish Champion neuer entertainde one motion of rest, but busied himselfe in trimming his horse, buckling on his armor, lacing on his Burgonet, and making his prayers to the diuine Maiestie of God for the conquest and victorie, till the mornings beautie chaced away the darknes of the night: but no sooner were the windowes of the day fully opened, but the valiant and noble minded Champion of Christendome entred the List, where the King in companie of the Thracian Lords was present to beholde the combate: and so after Saint Andrew had twice or thrice traced his horse vp and downe the Listes brauely flourishing his Launce, at the top whereof hung a pendant of gold, whose Posie was thus written in Siluer letters: This day a Martyr, or a Conquerour : Then entered a Knight in exceeding bright armor, mounted vpon a Courser as white as the Northerne Snow, whose caparison was of the colour of the elements, betwixt whom was a fierce encounter, but the Thracian had the foyle, and with disgrace departed the Listes. Then secondly entred another Knight in armour varnished with greene varnish, his Steede of the colour of an Iron gray, who likewise had the repulse by the worthie Christian. Thirdly entred a Knight in a blacke Corslet, mounted vpon a big boned Palfray, couered with a vale of sable silke, in his hand hee bore a Launce nayled rounde about with plates of steele: which Knight amongst the Thracians was accounted the strongest in the world, except it were those Giants that discended from a monstrous linnage: But no sooner encountred these hardie Champions, but their Launces shiuered in sunder, and flew so violently into the ayre, that it much amazed the beholders: then they alighted from their Steedes, and so valiantly besturd the with their keene edged Fauchions, that the fierie sparkles flew so fiercely from these noble Champions steely helmets, as from an Iron Anuill: But the combat indured not verie long, before the most hardie Scottish knight espied an aduantage, wherein he might shew his matchles fortitude: then he stroke such a violent blow vpon the Thracians Burgonet, that it cleaued his head iustly downe to the shoulders: whereat the King sudainely started from his seate, and with a wrathfull countenance threatned the Champions death in this manner: Proud Christian (sayde the King) thou shalt repent his death, and curse the time that euer thou camst to Thracia : his bloud we will reuenge vpon thy head, and quit thy committed crueltie with a suddaine death: and so in company of a hundred armed Knights, hee incompassed the Scottish Champion, intending by multitudes to murder him. But when the valiant Knight Saint Andrew sawe howe hee was supprest by trecherie, and inuironed with mightie troopes, hee called to heauen for succour, and animated himselfe by these wordes of incouragement: Now for the honour of Christendome, this day a Martyr or a Conquerour : and there withall he so valiantly behaued himselfe with his trusty Curtleaxe, that he made lanes of murthered men, and feld them downe by multitudes, like as the haruest man doth mowe downe eares of ripened corne: whereby they fell before his face like leaues from trees, when the Sommers pride declines her glory. So at the last, after much bloudshed, the Thracian King was compelled to yeelde to the Scottish Champions mercie, who swore him for the safegard of his life, to forsake his prophaned religion, and become a Christian, whose liuing true God the Thracian king vowed for euermore to worship, and thereupon hee kist the Champions sword. This conuersion of the Pagan King, so pleased the Maiestie of God, That hee presently gaue end to his daughters punishments, and turned the Ladies to their former shapes. But when the King beheld their smooth feathers, which were whyter than the Lilly, exchanged to a naturall fairenesse, and that their blacke bils and slender neckes were conuerted to their first created beauties, (where for excellent fairenes, the Queene of loue might build her Paradice,) he bade adue to his greife & long continued sorrowes, protesting euer hereafter to continue a true Christian for the Scottish Champions sake: by whome & by whose diuine Orizons, his daughters obtained their former features: So taking the Christian Knight in copany of the 6. Ladies, to an excellent rich Chamber, prepared with all things according to their wishes, where first the Christian Knight was vnarmed, then his wounds washed with white wine, new milke, and Rose water, and so after some daintie repast, conuayed to his nights repose. The Ladyes beeing the ioyfullest creatures vnder heauen, neuer entertained one thought of sleep, but passed the night in their Fathers companie, (whose minde was rauished with vnspeakable pleasures,) till the mornings messenger bade them good morrow. Thus all things being prepared in a readines, they departed the Castell, not like mourners to a heauie Funerall: but in triumphing maner, marching backe to the Thracian Pallace, with streaming Banners in the winde, Drums and Trumpets sounding ioyfull melodie and with sweete inspiring Musike, caused the ayre to resound with harmonie: But no sooner were they entred the Pallace, (which was in distance from the Gyants Castle, some ten miles) but their triumphes turned to exceeding sorrow, for Rossalinde with the Champion of Italie , as you heard before, was departed the Court: which vnexpected newes so daunted the whole companie, but especially the King, that the triumphes for that time were deferred, and messengers dispatcht in pursuite of the aduenturous Italian , and the louely Rossalinde . But when Saint Andrew of Scotland had intelligence, how it was one of the Knights that was imprisoned with him vnder the subiection of the wicked inchauntresse Kalyb , as you heard first of all in the beginning of the Historie, his heart thirsted for his most honourable companie, and his eyes neuer closed quietly, nor tooke any rest at all, vntill he was likewise departed in the pursuite of his sworne friend, which was the next night following, without making any acquainted with his intent: likewise when the sixe Ladies vnderstood the secret departure of the Scottish Champion, whome they affected dearer then any Knight in all the world, stored themselues with sufficient treasure, and by stealth tooke their iournies from their Fathers Pallace, intending either to find out the victorious and approoued Knight of Scotland, or to end their liues in some forraine Region. The rumor of whose departure, no sooner came to the Kings eares, but hee purposed the like trauaile, either to obtaine the sight of his Daughters againe, or to make his toombe in a countrie beyond the circuite of the Sunne. So attyring himselfe in a homely russet, like a Pilgrime with an Ebon staffe in his hand tipt with siluer, tooke his iournie all vnknowne from his Pallace, whose sodaine and secrete departure strooke such an extreame & intolerable heauines in the Court, that the Pallace gates were sealed vp with sorrow, and the walles behung with Sable mourning cloth. The Thracian Lordes exempted all pleasure, and like a flocke of sheepe strayed vp and downe without a shepheard, the Ladyes and courtly gentles sate sighing in their priuate chambers: where we leaue them for this time, and speake of the successe of the other Champions, and how fortune smiled on their aduenturous proceedings. How Saint Pattricke the Champion of Ireland redeemed the sixe Thracian Ladyes, out of the handes of thirtie bloudy minded Satyres, and of their purposed trauaile in the pursuite after the Champion of Scotland. But now of ye valiant & hardy knight at Armes, S. Pattricke the Champion of Ireland must I speake, whose aduenturous accidents were so nobly performed, that if my pen were made of steele, yet should I weare it to ye stumpes, sufficiently to declare his prowesse & worthy aduentures, When he departed from the brazen Piller, fro the other Champions the heauens smiled with a kind aspect, & sent him such a happy starre to be his guide, yt it led him to no courtly pleasures, nor to vaine delights of Ladies beauties, but to ye throne of fame, where honor sate installed vpon a seat of gold. Thither trauailed the warlike Champion of Ireland , whose illustrious battailes the Northe Iles haue chronicled in leaues of brasse: therefore Ireland be proud, for from thy bowels did spring a Champion, whose prowesse made the enemies of Christ to tremble, & watred the earth with streames of Pagas bloud: witnesse whereof the Ile of Rhodes , the key and strength of Christendome was recouered from the Turkes, by his martiall and inuincible prowesse: where his dangerous battailes, fierce encounters, bloudy skirmishes, and long assaults, would serue to fill a mighty volume, all which I passe ouer, and wholly discourse of things appertaining to this Historie. For after the warres at Rhodes were fully ended, Saint Pattricke (accounting idle ease the nurse of cowardise) bade Rhodes fare-well, being then strongly fortified with Christian Souldiers, and tooke his iourney through many an vnknowne Countrey, where at last, it pleased so the Queene of chance, to direct his steppes into a solitarie wildernesse, inhabited onely by wilde Satyrs, and a people of inhumane qualities, giuing their wicked mindes onely to murther, lust, and rape: wherein the noble champion trauelled vp and downe many a weary steppe, not knowing how to susteine his hunger, but by his owne industrie in killing of wilde venison, and pressing out the bloud betweene two mighty stones, dayly rosted it by the heat of the sunne: his lodging was in the hollow trunck of a blasted tree, which nightly preserued him from the dropping showres of heauen, his cheife companion was the sweete resounding eccho, which commonly reanswered the Champions words. In this maner liued Saint Pattricke the Irish Knight, in the woods, not knowing how to set himselfe at libertie, but wandring vp and downe as it were in a maze wrought by the curious workemanship of some excellent Gardiner, it was his chance at last, to come into a dismall shady thicket beset about with baylefull misselto, a place of horror, wherein he heard the cries of some distressed Ladyes, whose bitter lamentations seemed to pierce the cloudes, & to craue succour at the hands of God, which vnexpected cryes not a little daunted the Irish Knight: so that it caused him to prepare his weapon in readines, against some sudden encounter. So couching himselfe close vnder the roote on an olde withered Oake, (which had not flourished with greene leaues in many a yeere) hee espied a farre off a crew of bloudy minded Satyrs, haling by the hayre the sixe vnhappy Ladyes through many a thorny brake and bryer, whereby the beauty of their crimson cheekes was all to besprent with purple gore, and their eyes (within whose cleare glasses one might behold the God of loue dancing) all to bee rent and torne by the furie of the briers, whereby they coulde not see the light of heauen, nor the place of their vnfortunate abyding: which wofull spectacle forced such a terror in the heart of the Irish Knight, that he presently made out for the rescue of the Ladyes, against the bloody furie of the mercilesse Satyrs, which were in number about some thirtie, euery one hauing a mightie clubbe vpon his necke, which they had made with rootes of young Okes and Pine tree: yet this aduenturous Champion beeing nothing discouraged, but with a bolde and resolute minde, hee let driue at the sturdiest Satyr, whose armor of defence was made of a Buls hide, which was dryed so hard against the Sunne, that the Champions Curtle-axe little preuayled: after which the fell Satyrs incompassed the Christian knight round about, and so mightily opprest him with downe right blowes, that had hee not by good fortune leapt vnder the boughes of a mightie tree, his life had beene forst to giue the worlde a speedy farewell. But such was his nimblenesse and actiue pollicie, that ere long he sheathed his sharpe pointed Fauchion in one of the Satyrs brests: which wofull sight caused all the rest to flye from his presence, and left the sixe Ladyes to the pleasure and disposition of the most noble and couragious Christian Champion: Who after hee had sufficiently breathed, and cooled himselfe in the chill ayre, (beeing almost windlesse through the long encounter and bloudie skirmish) he demanded the cause of the Ladies trauayles, and by what meanes they hapned into the handes of those mercilesse Satyrs, who most cruelly and tyrannically attempted the vtter ruine and endles spoile of their vnspotted virginitie. To which courteous demaund one of the Ladies, after a deepe fetcht sigh or two, (beeing constrained from the bottome of her most sorrowfull heart) in the behalfe of her selfe, and the other distressed Ladies, replyed in this order: Know, braue minded Knight, that wee are the vnfortunate daughters of the King of Thrace , whose liues haue beene vnhappie euer since our creations. For first we did endure a long imprysonment vnder the hands of a cruell Gyant, and after, the heauens, to preserue our chastities from the wicked desire of the said Gyant, transformed vs into the shape of Swans, in which likenesse we remained seuen yeeres, but at last recouered by a worthie Christian knight, named Saint Andrew , the Champion of Scotland , after whom wee haue trauayled many a wearie step, neuer crost by any violence, vntill it was our angry Fates to ariue in this vnhappy wildernesse, where your eyes haue beene true witnesses of our wofull misfortunes. Which sad discourse being no sooner finished, but the worthy Champion began thus to comfort the distressed Ladies: The Christian Champion after whom you take in hand this weary trauaile (sayd the Irish Champion) is my approued freind, for whose company and wished sight, I will goe more wearie miles, then there be trees in this cursed wildernesse, and number my steps with the multitude of sands hidden in the seas: therefore most excellent Ladyes, true ornaments of beautie, bee sad companions in my trauailes, for I will neuer cease till I haue found our honourable freinde the Champion of Scotland , or some of those braue Knights, whome I haue not seene these seuen Summers. These wordes so contented the sorrowfull Ladyes, that without any exception they agreed, and with as much willingnesse consented, as the Champion had demaunded. So after they had recouered their sights, eased their wearines, and cured their wounds, which was by the secret vertues of certaine herbes growing in the same woodes, tooke their iourneys anew vnder the conduct of this worthy Champion Saint Patricke , where, after some dayes trauayle, obtayned the sight of a broad beaten way, where, committing their fortunes to the fatall Sisters, and setting their faces toward the East, merrily iourneyed together: In whose fortunate trauayles wee leaue, and speake of the seuenth Christian Champion, whose aduenturous exploytes and knightly honours deserues a golden pen, dipt in the inke of true Fame to discourse at large. How Saint Dauid the Champion of Wales, slue the Countie Palatine in the Tartarian Court, and after how hee was sent to the inchanted Garden of Ormondine, wherein by Magicke Arte he slept seuen yeeres. brazen piller, where as the other Champions of Christendome deuided themselues seuerally, to seeke for forraine aduentures, hee atcheiued many memorable thinges, as well in Christendome, as in those Nations that acknowledge no true God: which for this time I omit, and onely discourse what happened vnto him among the Tartarians : For beeing in the Emperour of Tartaries Court (a place very much honoured with valorous Knights, and highly grac't with a trayne of beauteous Ladyes) where the Emperour vpon a time ordained a solemne Ioust and Turnament to bee holden in the honour of his birth day: whither resorted at that time appointed, (from all the borders of Tartarie ) the best and hardiest Knights there remayning. In which honorable and princely exercise, the noble Knight Saint Dauid was appoynted Champion for the Emperour, who was mounted vpon a Moroco Steede, betrapped in rich caparison, wrought by the curious workemanship of the Indian women, vppon whose shield was set a golden Griffin rampant in a field of blew. Against him came the Countie Palatine , Sonne & heyre apparant to the Tartarian Emperour, brought in by twelue Knights, richly furnished with all habilimentes of honour, and paced three times about the Lists, before the Emperour and many Ladies that were present to beholde the honourable Turnament. The which being done, the twelue knights departed the lists, and the Countie Palatine prepared himselfe to encounter with the Christian knight, beeing then appointed cheife Champion for the day: who likewise locked down his beuer, and at the Trumpets sound by the Harrolds appointmet ran so fiercely one against the other, that the ground seemed to thunder vnder them, and the skies to resound ecchoes of their mightie strokes. At the second race the Champions ranne, Saint Dauid had the worse, and was constrayned through the forcible strength of the Countie Palatine , to fall backward almost beside his saddle: whereat the trumpets began to sound in signe of victorie: but yet the valiant Christian nothing dismayed, but with a courage (within whose eyes sate Knightly reuenge) ranne the third time against the Countie Palatine , and by the violent force of his strength, hee ouerthrew both horse and man, whereby the Counties bodie was so extremely brused with the fall of his horse, that his heart bloud issued foorth from his nostrels, and his vitall spirits pressed from the mansion of his brest, that hee was forced to giue the world a timelesse farewell. This fatall ouerthrow of the Countie Palatine , abashed the whole companie: but especially the Tartarian Emperour, who hauing no more Sonnes but him, caused the lists to be broken vp, the knights to be vnarmed, and the murthered Countie to be brought by foure Squires, into his Palace: where, after he was dispoyled of his furniture, and the Christian Knight receiued it in the honour of his victorie. The wofull Emperour bathed the Tartarians body with teares which dropped like Chrystall pearles vpon the congealed bloud, where after many sadde sighes, he breathed forth this wofull lamentation: Now are my triumphes turned to euerlasting woes, from a comicall pastime, to a direfull and bloudy tragedy: O most vnkinde fortune, neuer constant but in change! Why is my life deferde to see the downefall of my deare Sonne, the noble Countie Palatine ? why rends not this accursed earth whereon I stand, and presently swallow vp my body into her hungry bowels? Is this the vse of Christians, for true honour, to repay dishonour? could no base bloud serue to staine his deadly handes withall, but with the precious bloud of my deare Sonne, in whose reuenge the face of the heauens is stained with bloud, and cries for vengeance to the Maiestie of high eternall Ioue , the dreadfull Furies, the direfull daughters of darke night, and all the balefull company of burning Acharon , whose loynes bee girt with Serpents, and haire behangde with wreathes of Snakes, shall haunt, pursue and followe that accursed Christian Champion, that hath bereaued my Countrey Tartarie , of so precious a Iewell as my deare Sonne the Countie Palatine was, whose magnanimious prowesse did surpasse all the Knights of our countrey? Thus sorrowed the wofull Emperour for the death of his noble sonne: somtimes making the ecchoes of his lamentations pierce the elements: another while forcing his bitter curses to sinke to the deere foundation of Acharon : one while intending to bee reuenged vpon Saint Dauid the Christian Champion: then presently his intent was crost with a contrary imagination, that it was against the Law of Armes and a great dishonour to his Countrey, by violence to oppresse a strange Knight, whose actions haue euer beene guided by true honour: but yet at last this firmer resolution entred into his minde: There was adioyning vpon the borders of Tartary , an inchaunted garden kept by magicke art, from whence neuer any returned that attempted to enter, the Gouernour of which garden was a notable and famous Nigromancer named Ormondine , to which Magician the Tartarian Emperour intended to send the aduenturous Champion Saint Dauid , thereby to reuenge the Countie Palatines death. So the Emperour after some few dayes passed, and the Obsequies of his sonne being no sooner performed, but hee caused the Christian Knight to be brought into his presence, to whome he committed this heauy taske, and weary labour. Proud Knight (said the angry Emperour) thou knowest since thy ariuall in our Territories, how highly I haue honoured thee, not onely in granting libertie of life, but making thee cheife Champion of Tartarie , which high honour thou hast repaide with great ingratitude, & blemished true nobilitie, in acting my deare sonnes Tragedie: for which vnhappie deede thou rightly hast deserued death. But yet know, accursed Christian, that mercy harboureth in a princely minde, and where honour sits inthronized, there Iustice is not too seuere. Although thou hast deserued death: yet if thou wilt aduenture to the Inchaunted Garden, and bring hither the Magicians head, I grant thee not onely thy life, but there withall the crowne of Tartarie , after my decease: because I see thou hast a minde furnished with all princely thoughts, and adornde with true Magnanimitie. This heauy taske, and strange aduenture, not a little pleased the Noble Champion of Wales, whose minde euer thirsted after strange aduentures: and so after some considerate thoughts, in this maner he replyed: Most high and magnificent Emperour, (said the Champion) were this taske which you enioyne me to, as wonderfull as the labours of Hercules , or as fearefull as the enterprise which Iason made for the golden Fleece: yet would I attempt to finish, and returne with more triumph to Tartarie , than the Macedonian Monarch did to Babylon , when he had conquered the Angels of the world. Which wordes beeing no sooner ended, but the Emperour bound him by his oath of Knighthood, and by the loue hee beares vnto his natiue Countrie, neuer to follow any other aduenture, till he had performed his promise, which was to bring the Magician Ormondines head into Tartarie : and so the Emperour departed from the noble Knight Saint Dauid , hoping neuer to see him returne, but rather heare his vtter confusion, or euerlasting imprisonment. Thus this valiant Christian Champion, being bound to a heauie taske, within three dayes prepared all necessaries in readinesse for his departure: and so trauailed Westward, till he approached the sight of the inchaunted garden, the situation whereof somewhat daunted his valiant courage: for it was incompassed with a hedge of withered thornes and briers, which seemed continually to burne: vpon the toppe thereof, sate a number of strange and deformed things, some in the likenes of night Owles, that woondred at the presence of Saint Dauid : some in the shape of Prognies transformation, foretelling his infortunate successe, and some like Rauens, that with their harsh throates ring forth a balefull knell of some wofull Tragedie: the elements which couered the inchaunted garden, seemed to bee ouerspred with mistie cloudes, from whence continually shot flames of fire, as though the skies had beene filled with blazing commets: which fearefull spectacle, or rather the verie patterne of hell, strooke such a terror into the Champions heart, that twice he was in minde to returne without performing the aduenture, but for his oath and honour of Knighthood, which he had pawned for the accomplishment thereof: So laying his body on the bare earth, being the first nurse and mother of his life, he made his humble petition to God, that his mind might be neuer opprest with cowardise, nor his heart daunted with any faint feare, till hee had performed what the Tartarian Emperour had bound him to, the Champion rose from the ground, and with chearefull lookes beheld the elements, which seemed in his conceit to smile at the enterprise, and to foreshew a luckie euent. So the noble Knight Saint Dauid with a valiant courage went to the Garden gate, by which stoode a Rocke of stone, ouerspred with mosse: In which Rocke by Magicke Art was enclosed a sword, nothing outwardly appearing but the hilt, which was the richest to his iudgement that euer his eye beheld, for the steele worke was ingraued verie curiously, beset with Iasper and Saphire stones, the pummell was in the fashion of a Globe, of the purest siluer that euer the mines of rich America brought foorth: about the pummell was ingrauen in letters of Gold these verses following, My Magicke spels remaine most firmely bound, The worlds strange wonder, vnknowne by any one, Till that a Knight within the North be found, To pull this sword from out this Rocke of stone: Then ends my charmes, my Magicke Artes and all, By whose strong hand, wise Ormondine must fall. These verses draue such a conceited imagination into the Champions minde, that hee supposed himselfe to bee the Northren Knight, by whome the Nigromancer should bee conquered: Therefore without any further aduisement he put his hand into the hilt of the rich sword, thinking presently to pull it out from the inchaunted Rocke of Ormondine : But no sooner did he attempt that vaine enterprise, but his valiant courage and inuincible fortitude fayled him, and all his sences were ouer taken with a suddaine and heauie sleepe, whereby he was forced to let goe his hold, and to fall flat vpon the barraine ground, where his eyes were so fast locked vp by Magicke Art, and his waking sences drowned in such a dead slumber, that it was as much impossible to recouer himselfe from his sleepe, as to pull the Sunne out of the firmament: For through the secret mistery of the Nigromancers skill, he had intelligence of the Champions vnfortunate successe: who sent from the inchaunted Garden foure spirits, in the similitude and likenesse of foure beautifull Damsels, which wrapped the drowsie Champion in a sheete of the finest Arabian silke, and conueied him into a Caue, directly placed in the middle of the Garden, where they layd him vppon a soft bed, more softer then the downe of Culuers: where those beautifull Ladyes through the Arts of wicked Ormondine , continually kept him sleeping for the terme of seuen yeeres: one while singing with sugered songs more sweeter and delightfuller then the Syrens melodie: another while with rare conceited Musicke, surpassing the sweetenesse of Arions Harpe, which made the mightie Dolphins in the Seas, to daunce at the sound of his sweete inspiring melodie: or like the harmonie of Orpheus when hee iournyed downe into hell, where the deuils reioyced to heare his admired notes, and on earth both trees and stones did leape when he did but touch the siluer strings of his Iuorie Harpe. Thus was Saint Dauids aduenture crost with a wonderfull bad successe, whose dayes trauelles was turned into a nights repose: whose nights repose was made a heauy sleepe, which endured vntill seuen yeeres were fully finished: where we leaue Saint Dauid to the mercie of the Nigromancer Ormondine sleeping, and returne nowe to the most noble and magnanimious Champion Saint George , where we left him inprysoned in the Souldans Court. But now, gentle Reader, thou wilt thinke it strange, that all these Christian Champions shoulde meete together againe, seeing that they bee seperated into so many borders of the world: For Saint Dennis the Champion of Fraunce, remayneth nowe in the Court of Thessalie, with his Ladie Eglantine: Saint Iames the Champion of Spaine, in the Citie of Ciuell with Celestine , the fayre Ladie of Ierusalem: Saint Anthony the Champion of Italie, trauelling the world, in the company of a Thracian mayden, attired in a Pages apparell: Saint Andrew the Champion of Scotland, seeking after the Italian: Saint Pattricke the Champion of Ireland, after the Champion of Scotlaud, Saint Dauid of Wales, sleeping in the Inchanted garden, adioyning to the Kingdome of Tartarie, and Saint George the famous Champion of England, imprysoned in Persia: of whome, and of whose noble aduentures, I must a while discourse, till the honoured fame of the other Champions compelles mee to report their noble and Princely atchieuements. How Saint George escaped out of prison at Persia, and howe hee redeemed the Champion of Wales from his Inchantment, with other thinges that happened to the English Knight, with the tragicall tale of the Nigromancer Ormondine. Now seuen times had frostie bearded winter couered both hearbs and flowers with Snow, and behung the trees with Chrystall Isickles, seuen times had Ladie Ver beautified euerie field with natures ornaments, and seuen times had withered Autumne robd the earth of springing flowers, since the vnfortunate Saint George behelde the chearefull light of heauen, but obscurely liued in a dismall dungeon, by the Soldan of Persias commaundement, as you heard before in the beginning of the Historie: His vnhappie fortune so discontented his restlesse thoughts, that a thousand times a yeare he wisht an end of his life, and a thousand tymes hee cursed the day of his creation: his sighes in number did counteruayle a heape of sand, whose toppe might seeme to reach the skies, the which hee vainely breathed foorth against the walles of the pryson, many times making his humble supplications to the heauens, to redeeme him from that vale of miserie, and many times seeking occasion desperately to abbridge his dayes, whereby to triumph in his owne tragedie. But at last when seuen yeeres were fully ended, it was the Champions lucky fortune to find in a secret corner of the dungeon, a certaine yron Engin, which time had almost consumed with rust: where, with long labor, he digged himselfe a passage vnder the ground, till hee ascended iust in the middle of the Souldans Court, which was at that time of the night when all things were silent: the heauens he then beheld beautified with starres, and bright Cinthia , whose glistering beames he had not seene in many a hundred nightes before, seemed to smile at his safe deliuerie, and to stay her wandring course till the Noble English Champion founde meanes to get without the compasse of the Persian Court, where danger might no longer attend him, nor the strong gates of his Cittie hinder his flight, which in this manner was performed. For the noble Knight being as fearefull as the byrd newly escaped from the Fowlers nets, gazed round about, and listned where hee might heare the voyce of people. At last he heard the Groomes of the Souldans Stable, furnishing forth horses against the next morning for some noble atcheiuement. Then the valiant Champion S. George taking the yron Engin, wherewith he redeemed himselfe out of pryson, and burst open the doores, where hee slewe all the Groomes in the Souldans stable: which being done, hee tooke the strongest Palfray, and the richest furniture, with other necessaries appertayning to a Knight at Armes, and so rode in great maiestie to one of the Citie gates: where he saluted the Porter in this maner: Porter, open thy gates, for S. George of England is escaped, and hath murthered his warders, in whose pursuite the City is in Armes. Which words the simple Persian beleeued for a trueth, and so with all speede opened the gates, whereat the Champion of England departed, and left the Souldan in his dead sleepe, little mistrusting his sodaine escape. But by that time the purple spotted morning had parted with her gray, and the Suns bright countenance appeared on the mountaine tops, Saint George had ridden twenty league from the Persian Court, and before his departure was bruted in the Souldans Palace, the English Champion had recouered the sight of Grecia , past all danger of the Persian Knights, yt followed him with a swift pursuite. By which time, the extremity of hunger so sharpely tormented him, that he could trauayle no further, but was constrayned to suffize himselfe with certaine wild Chesnuts in steade of bread, and sowre Oringes in stead of drinke, and such faynt foode that grew by the wayes as he trauayled, where the necessitie and want of victuals compelled the noble knight Saint George to breath forth this pittifull complaint: O hunger, hunger, (sayd the Champion, thou art more sharper then the stroke of death, and the extremest punishment that euer man endured: If I were now King of Armenia , and cheife Potentate of Asia , yet would I giue my Diadem, my Scepter, with all my Prouinces, for one shiuer of browne bread: Oh, that the earth would bee so kinde, as to rip her bowels, and to cast vp some foode, to sustaine my want: or that the ayre might be choakt with mysts, whereby the feathered foules for want of breath might fall, and yeelde me some succour in this my famishment, and extreame penury: or that the Oceans would out-spread their branched armes, and couer these sunne-burnd valleys with their treasures, that I might suffice my hunger: but now I see, both heauen and earth, the hilles and dales, the skies and seas, the fish and foules, the byrdes and Siluane beastes, and all things vnder the cope of heauen, conspire my vtter ouerthrow better had it beene if I had ended my dayes in Persia , then to be famished in the broad world, where all things by natures appointment are ordained for mans vse: now in stead of Courtly delicates, I am forced to eate the fruit of trees, and in stead of Greekish wines, I am compelled to quench my thirst with the mornings dew, that nightly fals vppon the blades of the grasse. Thus complayned Saint George , vntill glistring Phoebus had mounted the top of heauen, and drawen the mystie vapors from the ground, where hee might behold the prospectes of Grecia , and which way to trauaile for most safetie, hee espied directly before his face a Tower standing vpon a chalkie clift, in distance from him some three miles, whither the Champion intended to goe, not to seeke for any aduenture, but to rest himselfe after his long iourny, and to get such victtuals as therein hee could finde to suffice his want. So setting forward with an easie pace, the heauens seemed to smile, and the birds to ring such a chirping peale of melodie, as though they did prognosticate a fortunate euent. The way he found so plaine, and the iourney so easie, that within halfe an houre hee approched before the sayde Tower: where vpon the wall stood a most beautifull woman, her attyre after the maner of a distressed Lady, and her lookes as heauie as the Queenes of Troy , when she beheld her Pallace set on fire. The valiant Knight Saint George , after he had alighted from his horse, hee gaue her this curteous salutation: Lady (said the Knight) for so you seeme by your outward appearance, if euer you pittied a traueller, or granted succour to a Christian Knight, giue to me one meales meate, now almost famished. To whom the Lady after a curst frowne or two, answered him in this order: Sir Knight, (quoth shee) I aduise thee with all speed to depart, for here thou getst a cold dinner: my Lord is a mighty Gyant, and beleeueth in Mahomet , and Termagant , and if hee once vnderstand thou art a Christian Knight: it is not all the gold of higher India, nor the riches of wealthy Babylon that can preserue thy life. Now by the honour of my Knight-hood, (replied Saint George ) and by the God that Christendome adores; were thy Lord more stronger then was mighty Hercules , that bore a mountaine on his backe: here will I either obtaine my dinner, or dye by his accursed hand. Those wordes so abashed the Lady, that she went with all speed from the Tower, and told the Gyant how a christian Knight remained at his gate, that had sworne to suffice his hunger in despite of his will: whereat the furious Gyant suddainely start vp, being as then in a sound sleepe, for it was at the middle of the day: who tooke a bat of Iron in his hand, and came downe to the Tower gate. His stature was in height fiue yards, his head brisled like a Bores, a foote there was betwixt each brow, his eyes hollow, his mouth wide, his lips were like two flaps of Steele, in all proportion more like a deuill then a man. Which deformed monster so daunted the courage of Saint George , that he prepared himselfe to death: not through feare of the monstrous Gyant, but for hunger and feeblenesse of body: but God so prouided for him, and so restored the Champions decayed strength, that hee endured battaile, till the closing vp of the euening, by which time the Gyant was almost blinde, through the sweat that ran downe fro his monstrous browes, whereby Saint George had the aduantage, & wounded the Gyant so cruelly vnder the short ribs, that he was compelled to fall to the ground, and to giue ende to his life. After which happy euent of the Gyants slaughter, the inuincible Champion S. George first gaue the honour of his victory to God, in whose power all his Fortune consisted. Then entring the Tower, whereas the Ladie presented him with all maner of delicates, and pure wines: but the English Knight suspecting some trecherie to be hidden in her proffered curtesie, caused the Lady, first to taste of euery daintie dish: Likewise of his wine, least some violent poyson should bee therein commixt: so finding all things pure and wholesome as nature required, hee suffized his hunger, rested his weary body, and refreshed his horse. And so leauing the Tower in keeping of the Lady, hee committed his fortune to a newe trauaile: where his reuiued spirits neuer entertained longer rest, but to the refreshing of himselfe and his horse. So taruailed he through ye parts of Grecia , the confines of Phrigia , & so into the borders of Tartarie , within whose Territories he had not long iourneied, but hee approached the sight of the inchaunted Garden of Ormondine , where S. Dauid the Champion of Wales had so long slept by Magicke Art. No sooner did hee behold the wonderfull situation thereof, but he espied Ormondines sword inclosed in the inchaunted Rocke: where after he had read the superscription written about the pummell, hee assaied to pull it out by strength: where hee no sooner put his hand into the hilt, but hee drew it forth with much ease, as though it had beene hung but by a threed of vntwisted silke: but when hee beheld the glistring brightnesse of the blade, and the wonderfull richnes of the pummell, hee accounted the prize more worth then the Armour of Achilles , which caused Aiax to runne mad, and more richer then Medeas golden Fleece: But by that time Saint George had circumspectly lookt into euery secrete of the sword, hee heard a strange and dismall voyce thunder in the skies, a terrible and mightie lumbring in the earth, whereat both hils and mountaines shooke, Rockes remooued, and huge Oakes rent into peeces: After this the gates of the inchaunted garden flew open, whereat incontinently came foorth Ormondine the Magician, with his haire staring on his head, his eyes sparkling, his cheekes blushing, his hands quiuering, his legs trembling, and all the rest of his body distempered, as though legions of spirits had incompast him about: hee came directly to the worthy English Knight that remained still by the inchaunted Rocke, from whence hee had pulled the Magicians sword: where, after the Nigromancer had sufficiently beheld his Princely countenance, whereon true honour sate inthronized, and viewed his portly personage, the image of true Knighthood, the which seemed in the Magicians eyes, to bee the rarest worke that euer nature framed: First taking the most valiant and magnanimious Champion S. George of England, by the steelie Gauntlet, and with great humilitie kissed it, then proffering him the curtesies due vnto strangers; which was performed very graciously: he afterward conducted him into the inchaunted Garden, to the Caue where the Champion of Wales was kept sleeping by the foure virgines delightfull songs, and after setting him in a chaire of Ebonie, Ormondine thus began to relate of wonderfull things: Renowmed Knight at armes (said the Nigromancer) Fames worthiest Champion, whose strange aduentures, all Christendome in time to come shall applaude: therefore bee silent till I haue told my Tragicke tale, for neuer after this my tongue shall speake againe: The Knight which thou seest here wrapped in this sheete of Gold, is a Christian Champion as thou art, sprung from the auncient seede of Troian warriours, who likewise attempted to draw this inchaunted sword, but my Magicke spels so preuailed, that hee was intercepted in the enterprise, and forced euer since to remaine sleeping in this Caue: but now the houre is almost come of his recouery, which by thee must bee accomplished: thou art that aduenturous Champion, whose inuincible hand must finish vp my detested life, and send my fleeting soule to draw the fatall Chariot vpon the banks of burning Acharon : for my time was limitted to remaine no longer in this Inchaunted Garden, but vntill that from the North should come a Knight that should pull this sword from the inchaunted rocke, which thou happily hast now performed: therefore I know my time is short, and my houre of destinie is at hand: what I report write it vp in brazen lines, for the time will come when this discourse shall highly benefit thee. Take heed thou obserue three things: first, that thou take to wife a pure maide: next, that thou erect a monument ouer thy Fathers graue: and lastly, that thou continue a professed foe to the enemies of Christ Iesus, bearing armes in the honour and prayse of thy Countrey. These things being truly and iustly obserued, thou shalt attaine to such honour, that all the Kingdomes of Christendome shall admire thy dignitie: What I speake is vpon no vaine imagination sprung from a franticke braine, but pronounced by the misticall and deepe art of Nigromancie. These words being no sooner ended, but the most honoured and fortunate Champion of England requested the Magician to describe his passed fortunes, and by what meanes he came first to be gouernour of that inchanted garden. To tell the discourse of mine owne life (replyed Ormondine ) will breede a newe sorrow in my heart, the remembrance whereof will rend my very soule: but yet (most noble Knight) to fulfill thy request, I will force my tongue to declare, what my heart denies to vtter: therefore prepare thy eares to entertaine ye wofulst tale, that euer any tongue deliuered. And so, after Saint George had a while sate silent, expecting his discourse, the Magician spake as followeth. Ormondine, of the miserie of his children. I was in former times, (so long as fortune smiled vppon mee) the King and onely Commaunder of Scythia , my name Ormondine , grac't in my youth, with two fayre Daughters, whom nature had not onely made beautifull, but replenisht them with all the gifts that Art could deuise: the elder, whose name was Castria , the fayrest mayde that euer Scythia brought foorth, her eyes like flaming torches, so dazeled the gazers, that like attractiue Adamants, they coniured all eyes to admyre her beautie: amongst a number of Knightes, that were insnared with her loue, there was one Floridon , Sonne to the King of Armenia, equall to her in all excellent ornaments of nature, a louelier couple neuer trode on earth, nor grac't any Princes Court in the whole world. This Floridon so feruently burned in affection with the admired Castria that he lusted after Uirginitie, and practised both by pollicie and fayre promises to enioy that precious pleasure, which after fell to his owne destruction: For vpon a tyme, when the mantles of darke night had closed in the light of heauen, and the whole Court had entertayned a silent rest, this lustfull Floridon entered Castrias lodging, furthered by her chamber-mayde, where, to his hard hap, he cropped the bud of sweet virginity, and left such a pawne within her wombe, that before many dayes were expired, her shame began to appeare, and the deceiued Lady was constrained to reueale her greife to Floridon : who in the meane time had betrothed himselfe to my younger daughter, whose name was Marcilla , no lesse beautified with natures gifts, then her elder sister: but when this vnconstant Floridon perceiued, that her belly began to grow big with the burden of his vnhappie seede, he vpbraided her with shame, laying dishonour in her dish, calling her strumpet, with many ignominious words, forswearing himselfe, neuer to haue committed any such infamous deede, protesting that he euer scornde to linke in womans bands, and counted chamber-loue a deadly sting and a deepe infection to the honour of Knighthood. These vnkinde speeches droue Castria into such extreame passion of mind, that she with a shamefast looke and blushing cheekes, after this maner reuealed her secrecie vnto him: What, knowes not Floridon (quoth the Lady) her, whom his lust hath stayned with dishonour? See, see vnconstant Knight, the pledge of faithlesse vowes, behold the wombe, where springs thy liuely Image, behold the marke, which staynes my fathers ancient house, and sets a shamefast blush vpon my cheekes, when I behold the company of chaste virgins: deare Floridon , shadow this my shame with mariage rights, that I be not accounted a by-word to the worlde, nor that my Babe, in time to come, be termed a base borne child: remember what plighted promises, what vowes and protestations past betwixt vs, remember the place and time of my dishonour, and be not like the furious Tyger, to repay loue with despite. At which words, Floridon with a wrathful countenance, replyed in these words: Egregious and shamelesse creature (quoth hee) with what brazen face darest thou outbraue mee thus? I tell thee Castria , my loue was euer yet to follow Armes, to heare the sound of Drummes, to ride vppon a nimble Steede, and not to trace a carpet daunce, like Priams Sonne, before the lustfull eyes of Menelaus wife: Therefore be gone, disturbing Strumpet, goe sing thy harsh melodie in companie of nightly byrdes, for I tell thee, the day will blush to couer thy monstrous shame. Which reprochfull speeches being no sooner ended, but Floridon departed her presence, leauing not behind him so much as a kinde looke: whereat the distressed Ladie, being oppressed with intolerable greife, sunke downe dead, not able to speake for a time, but at last, recouering her senses, shee began a new to complaine: I, that was wont (quoth shee) to walke with troupes of maydes, must now abandon and vtterly forsake all companyes, and seeke some secret Caue, wherein I may sit for euermore and bewayle my lost Uirginitie: If I returne vnto my Father, hee will refuse mee: if to my freinds they will bee ashamed of mee: if to strangers, they will scorne me: if to my Floridon , Oh, hee denyeth mee, and accounts my sight as ominous, as the balefull Crocodiles. Oh that I might, in the shape of a byrd, or like the rauisht Philomela , fill euery wood and wildernesse with my dishonour, for now am I neyther chaste Uirgin, nor honest wife, but a shamelesse strumpet, and the worldes cheife scorne: whereat, me thinks, I see how vertuous and chaste maidens point, and terme mee a vicious Dame. Oh vnconstant Floridon ! thou diddest promise to shadow this my fault with mariage, but vowes I see are vaine: Thou hast forsaken mee, and tyed thy faith vnto my sister Marcilla , who must enioy thy loue, because shee continues chaste without any spotte of dishonour. Oh woe to thee vnconstant Knight, thy flattering eyes deceiued mee, and thy golden tongue inticed mee to commit that Sinne, which all the Ocean streames can neuer wash away: But why stand I relating thus in vaine? the deede is done, and Floridon will triumph in the spoyle of my Uirginitie, while he lyes dallying in my sisters armes: Nay, first the fatall lights of Funeralles shall maske about his mariage bedde, and his bridall blaze Ile quench with bloud. for I will goe vnto their mariage Chamber, where as these handes of mine shall rende my sisters wombe, before shee shall enioy the interest of my bedde: rage heart, in stead of loue, delight in murther, let vengeance be euer in thy thoughts, vntill thou hast quencht with bloud, the furies of disloyall loue. Thus complayned the wofull Castria , vp and downe the Court of Scythia , vntill the mistresse of the night had spent fiue moneths: at the end of which time, the appointed mariage of Floridon add Marcilla drew nigh: the thought wherof, was an endles terrour to her heart, and of a more intolerable burden, then the paynes of her wombe: the which shee gyrded in so extreamely for feare of suspition, and partly vnder colour, to bring about her intended Tragedie, which was in this bloudie manner accomplished and brought about. The day at last came, whereon Floridon and Marcilla shoul tie that sacred knot of mariage, and the Princes and Potentates of Scythia were all present as witnesses to Himens holy rits: In which Honourable assemblie, none were more busier then Castria , to beautifie her sisters wedding. The ceremonies being no sooner performed, & the day spent in all pleasures fitting the Honour of so great and mightie a traine, but Castria requested the vse of the Countrie, which was this; that the first night of euery maydens mariage, a pure Uirgin should lie with the Bride, which honorable taske was committed to Castria : who prouided against the houre appointed, a siluer bodkin, and hid it secretly in the trammels of her hayre, wherewith shee intended to prosecute reuenge. The Brides lodging chamber was appointed farre from the hearing of any one, least the noyse of people shoulde hinder their quiet sleepe. But at last, when the houre of her wishes approched, that the Bride should take leaue of the Ladies and maydens that attended her to her Chamber, the new maryed Floridon , in companie of many Scythian Knights, committed Marcilla to her quiet rest, little mistrusting the bloudy intent of her sisters minde. But now behold, how euery thing fell out according to her desires. The Ladies and Gentle women being no sooner departed, and silence taken possession of the whole Court, but Castria with her owne hands locked the chamber doore, and secretly conuayed the keyes vnder the beds head, not perceyued by the betrayed Marcilla : which poore Lady, after some few speeches, departed to bed: wherein she was no sooner layed, but a heauie sleepe ouer-mastred her sences, whereby her tongue was forced to bid her sister good night, who as then sate discontented by her bed side, watching the time, wherein she might conueniently inact the bloudy Tragedie: vpon a Court table stood two burning Tapers that gaue light to the whole Chamber, which in her conceite, seemed to burne blew: which fatall spectakle incouraged her to a more speedy performance: and by the light of the two lampes, she vnbraced her vestures, and stripped her selfe into her milke-white smocke, hauing not so much vpon her head, as a Caule, to hold vp her golden haire: After this, she tooke her siluer bodkin, that before, she had secretly hidden in her haire, and with a wrathfull countenance, (vpon whose browes sate the image of pale death) shee came to her new maried sister, being then ouer come with a heauie slumber, and with her bodkin pierced her tender brest: who immediatly at the stroke thereof, started from her sleepe, and gaue such a pittifull skrike, that it would haue wakened the whole Court, but that the Chamber stood farre from the hearing of all company, except her bloudy minded sister, whose hand was ready to redouble her furie, with a second stroke. But when Marcilla beheld the sheetes and ornaments of her bed bestaind with purple gore, and from her brest run streames of Crimson bloud, which like to a fountaine, trickled from her Iuorie bosome, shee breathed forth this earnest exclamation against the crueltie of Castria : O sister, (said shee) hath nature harboured in thy brest a bloudy minde! What furie hath incenst thee, thus to commit my Tragedie? In what haue I mis-done, or wherein hath my tongue offended thee? What cause hath beene occasion, that thy remorceles hand, against true natiuity, hath conuerted my ioyfull Nuptials, to a wofull Funerall? This is the cause (replyed Castria , and there withall shewed her wombe, growne big through the burden of her Child) that I haue bathed my hands in thy detested bloud, See, see Marcilla (said shee) the vnhappy bedde, wherein thy accursed husband hath sowne his seed, by which, my virgins honour is for euer stainde: this is the spot which thy heart bloud must wash away, and this is the shame that nothing but death shall finish: Therefore a sweet reuenge, and a present murther likewise will I commit vpon my selfe, whereby my loathed soule, in company of my vnborne babe shall wander with thy Ghost, along the Stygian lakes, Which wordes being no sooner finished, but she violently pierced her owne brest: whereby the two sisters blouds were equally mingled together: but now Marcilla being the first wounded, and the neerer drawing towards death, shee wofully complained this dying Lamentation: Draw neere (said shee) you blazing starres; you earthly angels, & imbrodered Girls, you louely Ladies & flourishing Dames of Scythia , behold her wofull ende, whose glories mounted higher then the elements; behold my mariage bed which is beautified with Tapestrie, now conuerted to deaths bloudy habitation, my braue attire to earthly mould, and my Princely Pallaces to Elizium shades, being a place appointed for those Dames that liued and died true virgins: for now I feele the paines of death closing my liues windowes, and my heart ready to entertaine the stroke of destinie: Come Floridon , come, in stead of armes, gette Eagles wings, that in thy bosome I may breath my murthered Ghost: world, fare thou well, I was two proud of thy inticing pleasures: thy Princely pompe, and all thy glistering ornaments, I must for euer bid adue. Father, farewell, with all my masking Traine of Courtly Ladyes, Knights & Gentlewomen: my death, I know will make thy Pallace, deaths gloomy regiment: & last of al, farewel my noble Floridon , for thy sweet sake Marcilla now is murthered. At the end of which words, the dying Lady being faint with the aboundance of bloud that issued from her wounded brest, gaue vp the Ghost. No sooner had pale death seyzed vpon her liuelesse body, but Castria , likewise through the extremitie of her wound was ready to entertaine the stroke of the fatall Sisters, who likewise complained in this maner: Harken, you louing Girles, (said shee) to you I speake, that know what endlesse greife, disloyall and false loue breeds in constant mindes, the thought whereof is so intolerable to my soule, that it exceedes the torments of Danaus daughters, that continually fill water into the bottomles tubs in hell. Oh, that my eares had neuer listned to his sugred speeches, or neuer knowne what Courtly pleasures ment, where beautie is a baite for euery lustfull eye: but rather to haue liued a Countrey Lasse, where sweet content is harboured, and beauty shrowded vnder true humilitie: then had not Floridon bereaued me of my sweet virginitie: nor had not this accursed hand committed this cruell murder: but oh, I feele my soule passing to Elizium shades, where Creusas shadow, and Didos Ghost haue their abiding: thither doth my spirit flye, to be entertained amongst those vnhappy Ladyes that vnconstant loue hath murdered: thus Castria , not being able to speake any longer, gaue a very grieuous sigh, and so bade a due to the world. But when the mornings sun had chased away the darksome night Floridon who little mistrusted the tragedy of the two sisters, repayred to the chamber doore with a Consort of skilfull Musicians, where their conspiring harmony sounded to the walles, and Floridons mornings salutations were spent in vaine: for death so stopt the two princes eares, that no resound of thankes at all reanswered his words, which caused Floridon to depart, thinking them to be a sleepe, and to returne within an houre after, who without any companie came to the Chamber dore, where hee againe found all silent: at which, suspecting some further euent, burst open the doore, where being no sooner entred, but hee found the two Ladyes weltring in purple gore: which wofull spectacle presently so bereaued him of his wits, that like a franticke man hee raged vp and downe, and in this maner bitterly complained: Oh you immortall powers! open the wrathfull gates of heauen, and in your iustice punish me; for my vnconstant loue hath murthered two of the brauest Ladies that euer nature framed: reuiue, sweet Dames of Scythia , and heare me speake, that am the wofullest wretch that euer spake with tongue: If Ghost may here be giuen for Ghost, deare Lady take my soule and liue, or if my heart might dwell within your brests, this hand shall equally deuide it: What are words vaine? although my proffer cannot purchase life, nor recouer your breathing spirits againe; yet vengeance shall you haue, this hand shall vntwine my fatall twist, and bereaue my bloudy brest of soule, whereby my vnhappy Ghost shall follow you through Tartar gulfes, through burning lakes, and through the lowring shades of dreadfull Cossitus : gape, gape, sweete earth, & in thy wombe make all our toombes together. Which wofull lamentation being no sooner breathed fro his sorrowfull brest, but he finished his dayes, by the stroke of that same accursed bodkin, that was ye bloudy instrument of the two sisters deathes; the which hee found still remayning in the remorceles hand of Castria . Thus haue you heard (most worthy Knight) the true tragedie of three of the most goodliest personages that euer nature framed: but now with diligent eares listen to the vnfortunate discourse of mine owne misery, which in this vnhappy manner fell out: for no sooner came the flying musicke of the murthered Princes to my eares, but I grew into such a discontented passion, that I abandoned my selfe from company of people, and sate for seuen moneths in a solitarie passion lamenting the losse of my Children, like weeping Niobe , which was the sorrowfullest Lady that euer liued. During which time, the report of Floridons vnhappy Tragedie was bruted to his Fathers eares, being the sole King of Armenia : whose greife so exceeded the bounds of reason, that with all conuenient speed, the greatest strength Armenia could make, and in reuenge of his sonnes vnhappie murther, entred our Territories, and with his well approued warriours subdued our Prouinces, slaughtered our Souldiers, conquered our Captaynes, slew our Commons, burnt our Cities, and left our Countrie villages desolate, whereby when I beheld my Countrey ouerspread with famine, fire and sword, three intestine plagues wherewith heauen scourgeth the sinnes of the wicked; I was forced for safegarde of my life, to forsake my natiue habitation and Kingly gouernement, onely committing my fortune (like a banisht exile) to wander vnknowne passages, where care was my cheife companion, and discontent my onely soliciter: at last it was my destinie to ariue in this vnhappy place which I supposed to be the walkes of despaire, where I had not remained many dayes in my melancholy passions, but me thought the wary iawes of deepe Auerna opened, from whence ascended a most fearefull Deuill, that inticed me to bequeath my fortune to his disposing, and he would defend me from the fury of the whole world: to which I presently condiscended vpon some assurance. Then presently he placed before my face this inchaunted sword, so surely closed in stone, that it should neuer be pulled out, but by the hands of a Christian Knight; and till that taske were performed I should liue exempt from all danger, although all the kingdomes of the earth assayled me: which taske (most aduenturous Champion) thou hast now performed, whereby I know the houre of my death approcheth, and my time of cofusion is at hand. This discourse pronounced by the Nigromancer Ormondine , was no sooner finished, but the worthie Champion Saint George hearde such a terrible ratling in the skyes, & such a lumbring in the earth, that he expected some strange euent to follow: then casting his eyes aside, he saw the inchaunted Garden to vanish, and the Champion of Wales to awake from his dead sleepe, wherein hee had remayned seuen yeeres: who like one newly risen from a swoone, for a time stood speachles, not able to vtter a word, till he beheld the Noble Champion of England, that stedfastly gazed vpon the Nigromancer: who at the vanishing of the Inchantment, presently gaue a most terrible grone & dyed. The two Champions, after many curteous imbracings and kinde greetings, reueyled eche to other the strange aduentures they had passed, and how Saint Dauid was bound by the oathe of his Knight-hood to performe the aduenture of Ormondine : to which Saint George presently condescended, who deliuered the Inchanted sword, with the Nigromancers head, into the hands of Saint Dauid , the which hee presently disseuered from his dead body. Here must my weary Muse leaue Saint Dauid , trauayling with Ormondines head to the Tartarian Emperour, and speake of the following aduentures that happened to Saint George , after his departure from the Inchanted Garden. How Saint George ariued at Tripolie in Barbarie, where hee stole away Sabra the Kings daughter of Egypt, from the Blackamore King, and how she was knowen to be a pure virgin by the meanes of a Lyon, and what happened vnto him in the same aduenture. former chapter dispatched his iourny towardes Christendome, whose pleasant banks hee long desired to behold,  & thought euery day a yeere, till his eyes enioyed a sweete sight of his natiue country England, vpon whose Chalkey cliffes he had not trode in many a wearie Summers day: therefore committing his iourney to a fortunate successe, he trauayled through many a dangerous country: where the people were not onely of a bloudie dispsition, giuen to all maner of wickednesse, but the soyle greatly anoyed with wild beastes, through which hee could not well trauayle without danger: therefore he carried continually in one of his hands, a weapon readie charged, to encounter with the Heathen people, if occasion should serue, and in the other hand, a bright burning blaze of fire, to defend him from the furie of wild beastes, if by violence they assayled him. Thus in extreame danger trauayled the Noble and aduenterous Champion Saint George , till hee ariued in the Territories of Barbarie, in which Countrie hee purposed for a time to remaine, and to seeke for some noble atchiuement, whereby his fame might be increased, and his honored name ring through all the Kingdomes of the world: and being incouraged with this Princely cogitation, the Noble Champion of England climed to the topp of a huge mountaine, where he vnlocked his Beauer, which before had not beene lifted vp in many a day, and beheld the wide and spacious Countrie, how it was beautified with loftie Pines, & adorned with many good Pallaces. But amongst the number of the Townes and Citties, which the English Champion beheld, there was one which seemed to exceede the rest, both in situation and braue buildinges, which hee supposed to bee the cheifest Cittie in all the Country, and the place where the King vsually kept his Court: to which place S. George intended to trauayle, not to furnish himselfe with any needefull thing, but to accomplish some honourable aduenture, whereby his worthie deedes might bee eternized in the bookes of memorie. So after hee had descended from the top of the steepie mountaine, and had trauayled in a low valley, about some two or three miles, he approached an old and almost ruinated Hermitage, ouergrowne with mosse, & other withered weedes: before the entrie of which Hermitage, sate an auncient Father vpon a round stone, taking the heate of the warme Sun, which cast such a comfortable brightnes vpon the Hermits face, that his white beard seemed to glister like siluer, and his head to exceede the whitenesse of the Northren Isickles: Of whom after S. George had giuen the due reuerence that belonged vnto age, he demaunded the name of the Countrie, and the Citty he trauayled to, and vnder what King the Country was gouerned? To whom the courteous Hermet thus replyed: Most noble Knight, for so I gesse you are by your furniture and outward appearance (sayd the Hermet) you are now in the confines of Barbarie, the Cittie opposite before your eyes is called Tripoly, now vnder the gouernement of Almidor , the blacke King of Moroco: in which Citie hee nowe keepeth his Court, attended on by as many valiant Knights as any King vnder the cope of heauen. At which words, the noble Champion of England suddainely started, as though he had intelligence of some balefull newes, which deepely discontented his Princely mind: his heart was presently incenst with a speedie reuenge, & his mind so extreamely thirsted after Almidors Tragedie, that he could scarce make answere againe to the Hermets wordes: But bridling his furie, the angry Champion spake in this manner: Graue Father (sayd he) through the trechery of that accursed King, I indured seuen yeares imprysonment in Persia, where I suffered both hunger, cold, and extreame miserie: but if I had my good sword Askalon , and my trustie Palfray which I left in the Egyptian Court, where remaynes my betrothed Loue, the Kings daughter of Egypt, I would be reuenged vpon the head of proud Almidor , were his Gard more stronger then the Armie of Xerxes , whose multitudes dranke riuers dry. Why, sayd the Hermet, Sabra the Kings daughter of Egypt is now Queene of Barbarie, and since her Nuptials were solemnely performed in Tripoly, are seuen Summers fully finished. Now by the honour of my Country England (replyed Saint George ) the place of my Natiuitie, and as I am true Christian Knight, these eyes of mine shall neuer close, nor this vndaunted heart neuer entertaine one thought of peace, nor this vnconquered hand receiue one minutes rest, vntill I haue obtained a sight of that sweete Princesse, for whose sake I haue indured so long imprisonment: therefore deare Father, bee thus kind to a trauailer, as to exchange thy clothing, for this my rich furniture and lustie Steede, which I brought from the Souldan of Persia: for in the habit of a Palmer I may enioy the fruition of her sight without suspition: otherwise I must needs bee constrained by violence, with my trustie Fauchion to make way into her Princely Pallace: where I know shee is attended on most carefully, by many valiant and couragious Champions: therefore courteously deliuer mee thy Hermets gowne, and I will giue thee in boote with my Horse and Armour, this Boxe of precious Iewels: which when the graue Hermet beheld, he humbly thanked the noble Champion, and so with all the speede they could possible make, exchanged apparell and in this maner departed. The Palmer being glad, repaired to his Hermitage with Saint Georges furniture, and S. George in the Palmers apparell trauailed towards the Cittie of Tripoly: who no sooner came neere to the sumptuous buildings of the Court, but hee espied a hundred poore Palmers kneeling at the Gate, to whome Saint George spake in this maner, not with loftie and heroycall speeches, beseeming a Princely Champion, but with meeke and humble words like to an aged Palmer. My deare brethren (said the Champion) for what intent remaine you heere, or what expect you from this honourable Court? We abide here (answered the Palmers) for an almes, which the Queene once a day hath giuen this seuen yeeres, for the sake of an English Knight, named S. George , whom shee affecteth aboue all the Knights in the world. But when will this be giuen (said S. George? ) In the after noone (replied the Palmers) vntill which time, vpon our bended knees wee hourely pray for the good fortune of that most noble English Knight. Which speaches so highly pleased the valiant minded Champion, Saint George , that he thought euery minute a whole yeere, till the golden Sunne had past away the middle part of heauen: for it was but newly risen from Auroraes bedde, whose light as yet with a shame fast radiant blush, distayned the Easterne skie. During which time, the most valiant and magnanimious Champion, Saint George of England, one while remembring of the extreame miserie hee endured in Persia, for her sake, whereat he let fall many Chrystall teares from his eyes: another while thinking vpon the terrible battell hee had with the burning Dragon in Egypt, where he redeemed her from the fatall iawes of death. But at last it was his chance to walke about the Court, beholding the sumptuous buildings, and the curious ingrauen workes by the atcheiuement of man, bestowed vpon the glistering windowes: where he heard to his exceeding pleasure, the heauenly voyce of his beloued Sabra , descending from a windowe vpon the West side of the Pallace, where shee warbled forth this sorrowfull Dittie vpon her Iuorie Lute: Die all desires of ioy and Courtly pleasures, Die all desires of Princely Royaltie, Die all desires of wealth and worldly treasures, Die all desires of stately Maiestie: Sith he is gone that pleased most mine eye, For whome I wish ten thousand times to dye. O that mine eyes might neuer cease to weepe, O that my tongue might euenmore complaine, O that my soule might in his bosome sleepe, For whose sweete sake my heart doth liue in paine: In woe I sing, with brinish teares besprent, Out worne with greife, consumde with discontent. In time my sighes will dim the heauens faire light, Which hourely flye from my tormented brest, Except Saint George that noble English Knight, With safe returne abandon my vnrest: Then carefull cries shall end with deepe annoy, Exchanging weeping teares, for smiling ioy. Before the face of heauen, this vowe I make, Though vnkind freinds haue wed me to their will, And crownd me Queene my ardent flames to slake, That in despight of them shall flourish still. Beare witnesse, heauens and earth, what I haue said, For Georges sake I liue and die a maide. Which sorrowfull dittie being no sooner ended, but she departed the window, quite from the hearing of the English Champion, that stood gazing vp to the casements, preparing his eares to entertaine her sweete tuned melodie the second time: but his expectation was in vaine; whereat he grew into more perplexed passions, then Aeneas , when hee had lost his beloued Crusa amongst the armie of the Grecians: sometimes wishing the day to vanish in a moment, that the houre of her beneuolence might approch: other times comforting his sad cogitations with the remembrance of her true chastitie, and long continued constancy for his sake; comparing her loue vnto Thisbes , her chastitie to Dianaes , and her constancie to Penelopes . Thus spent hee the time away, till the gorgious Sunne began to decline to the westerne parts of the earth, and the Palmers should receiue her wonted beneuolence: against which time, the English Champion placed himselfe in middest of the Palmers, that expected the wished houre of her comming, who at the time appointed, came to the Pallace gate, attired in mourning vesture like Polixena , King Priams daughter, when she went to sacrifice: her haire after a carelesse maner hung wauering in the winde, ouerchanged almost from yellow burnisht brightnesse, to the colour of siluer, through her long continued sorrow & greife of heart: her eyes seemed to haue wept a sea of teares, and her wonted beautie (to whose excellent fairenesse, all the Ladyes in the world did sometimes yeeld obeysance) was now stayned with the pearled dewe that trickled downe her cheekes: where, after the sorrowfull Queene had iustly numbred the Palmers, and with vigilant eyes beheld the princely countenance of Saint George , her colour began to exchange from red to white, and from white to red, as though the Lilly and the Rose had stroue for superioritie: but yet colouring her cogitations vnder a smooth browe, first deliuered her almes to the Palmers, then taking Saint George aside, to whome she thus kindly began to conferre: Palmer (sayd shee) thou resemblest both in princely countenance and courteous behauiour, that thrise honoured Champion of England, for whose sake I haue dayly bestowed my beneuolence for this seuen yeeres, his name Saint George , his fame I know thou hast heard reported in many a countrey, to be ye brauest Knight yt euer buckled steeled helme: therefore for his sake will I grace thee with the cheifest honor in this Court: In stead of thy russet gaberdine, I will clothe thee in purple silke, and in steade of thy Ebon staffe, thy hand shall wield the richest sword that euer Princely eye beheld. To whome the Noble Champion Saint George replied in this courteous maner. I haue heard (quoth hee) the Princely atcheiuements and magnanimious aduentures of that honoured English Knight which you so dearely affect, bruted through many a Princes Court: and how for the loue of a Lady, he hath indured a long imprisonment, from whence he neuer looketh to returne, but to spend the remnant of his dayes in lasting miserie, at which words, the Queene let fall from her eyes such a showre of pearled teares, and sent such a number of strained sighes from her grieued heart, that her sorrow seemed to exceede the Queenes of Carthage, when shee had for euer lost the sight of her beloued Lord. But the braue minded Champion Saint George purposed no longer to continue secrete, but with his discouery to conuert her sorrowfull mones to smiling ioy: and so casting off his Palmers weed, acknowledged himselfe to the Queene, and therewithall shewed the halfe ring, whereon was engrauen this posie, Ardeo affectione : which Ring in former time (as you may reade before) they had most equally deuided betwixt them, to bee kept in remembrance of their plighted faiths. Which vnsuspected sight highly pleased the beauteous Sabra , and her ioy so exceeded the bounds of reason, that shee could not speake one word, but was constrayned through the newe conceiued pleasure, to breathe a sad sigh or two into the Champions bosome, who like a true innobled Knight, entertayned her with a louing kisse. But after these two Louers had fully discoursed eche to other the secrets of their soules, Sabra , how shee continued for his loue a pure virgin, through the secret nature of a golden chaine steept in Tigers bloud, the which shee wore seuen tymes doubled about her Iuory necke, tooke him by the portly hand, and led him to her husbands stable, where stood his approued Palfray, which shee for seuen yeares had fed with her owne handes: who no sooner espyed the returne of his master, but hee grewe more prowde of his presence, then Bucephalus of the Macedonian Monarchs, when he had most ioyfully returned in triumph from any victorious conquest. Now is the time (sayd the excellent Princesse Sabra ) that thou mayest seale vp the quittance of our former loues: therefore withall conuenient speede take thy approued Palfray, with thy trustie sword Askalon , which I will presently deliuer into thy hands, and with all celeritie conuay mee from this vnhappy countrie: for the King my husband, with all his aduenturous Champions, are now rode forth on hunting, whose absence will further our flight: but if thou stay till his returne, it is not a hundred of the hardiest Knights in the world, can beare me from this accursed Pallace. At which words, Saint George hauing a minde gracd withal excellent vertues, replyed in this maner: Thou knowest, my diuine Mistresse, that for thy loue I would indure as many dangers as Iason suffered in the Ile of Calcos, so I might at last enioy the pleasure of true Uirginitie. But howe canst thou remayne a pure mayde, when thou hast beene a crowned Queene for these seuen yeeres, and euery night hast entertayned a King into thy bed? If thou findest me not a true mayd in all that thou canst say or doe, send me backe againe hither vnto my foe, whose bed I account more lothsome, then a den of Snakes, and his sight more ominous then the Crocodiles. As for the Moroco Crowne, which by force of freinds was set vppon my head, I wish that it might bee turnde into a blaze of quenchlesse fire, so it might not indanger my bodie: and for the name of Queene, I account it a vaine title; for I had rather bee thy English Ladie, then the greatest Empresse in the world. At which speeches Saint George willingly condiscended and with all speede purposed to goe into England: and therewithall sealed an assurance with as sweete a kisse, as Paris gaue to louely Helena , when she consented to forsake her natiue countrey, and to trauell from her husband Menelaus into Troy. So loosing no time, least delay might breed danger, Sabra furnished herselfe with sufficient treasure, and speedily deliuered to Saint George his trustie sworde, which shee had kept seuen yeeres for his sake, with all the furniture belonging to his approued Steede, who no sooner receiued her proffered gifts, which he accounted dearer then the Asian Monarchy, but presently sadled his horse, and beautified his strong limmes with rich Caparison. In the meane time, Sabra through fayre speeches and large promises, obtayned the good will of an Eunuch, that was appoynted for her gard in the Kings absence, to accompany them in their intended trauayle, and to serue as a trusty guide, if occasion required: which with the Lady stoode ready at the Champions commaundement: who no sooner had furnished himselfe with sufficient habiliments of warre belonging to so dangerous a iourney, but hee plast his beloued Mistris vppon a gentle Palfray, which alwayes kneeled downe vntill shee had ascended the saddle: and likewise her Eunuch was mounted vpon another Steede, whereon all their rich furniture, with costly Iewels and other treasure was borne. So these three worthy personages committed their trauels to the guide of Fortune, who preserued them from the dangers of pursuing enemies, which at the Kings returne from hunting, followed amaine to euery Port and Hauen, that deuided the kingdome of Barbarie from the confines of Christendome. But kinde destinie so guided their steps, that they trauayled another way, contrarie to their expectations: for when they looked to ariue vpon the territories of Europe, they were cast vpon the fruitefull bankes of Grecia: in which countrey wee must tell what happened to the three trauaylers, and omit the vaine pursuite of the Moroco Knights, the wrathfull melancholy of the King, and the bruted rumor that was amongst the Comons of the Queenes departure: who caused the larum belles to be rung out, and the Beacons to be set on fire, as though the enemie had entred their countrey, But now, Melpomine , thou Tragicke sister of the Muses, report what vnluckie crosses happened to these three trauaylers in the confines of Grecia, and how their smiling Comedie was by ill hap turned into a weeping Tragedie: for when they had iournyed some three or foure leagues ouer many a loftie hill, they approched into a mightie and fearefull wildernsse, thorow which, the wayes seemed so long: and the Sunne beames so exceedingly glowed, that Sabra , what for wearinesse in trauayle, and the extreame heate of the day, was constrayned to rest vnder the shelter of a mighty Oake, whose branches had not beene lopt in many a yeere: where shee had not long remayned, but her heart beganne to faint for hunger, and her colour that was but a little before as fayre as any Ladyes in the world, beganne to change for want of some drinke: whereat the most famous Champion Saint George , halfe dead with very greife, comforted her as well as he could after this maner: Faint not my deare Ladie (sayd the Champion) here is that good sword that once preserued thee from the burning Dragon; and before thou die for want of sustenance, it shall make way to euery corner of this wildernes; where I will either kill some venison to refresh thy hungry stomacke, or make my tombe in the bowels of some monstrous beast: there fore abide thou here vnder this tree in company of thy faithfull Eunuch, till I returne either with the flesh of some wilde Deare, or els some flying Byrd, to refresh thy spirites to a newe trauayle. Thus left he his beloued Lady with the Eunuche to the mercy of the woods, and trauayled vp and downe the wildernesse, till he espyed a heard of fatted Deare, from which company hee singled out the fayrest, and like a tripping Satyre coursed her to death: then with his keene edged sworde cut out the goodliest haunch of venison that euer Hunters eye beheld: which gift hee supposed to bee most welcome to his beloued Lady. But marke what happened in his absence to the two weary trauaylers abiding vnder the tree: where after Saint Georges departure, they had not long sitten discoursing, one while of their long iournies, another while of their safe deliuery from the Blackamoore King, spending the stealing tyme away with many an ancient storie, but there appeared out of a thicket, two huge and monstrous Lyons, which came directly pacing towards the two trauaylers: which fearefull spectacle when Sabra beheld, hauing a heart ouercharged with the extreame feare of death, wholy committed her soule into the hands of God, and her body almost famished for foode, to suffice the hunger of the two furious Lyons: who by the appoyntment of Heauen, proffered not so much, as to lay their wrathfull pawes vpon the smallest part of the Ladyes garment, but with eger moode assayled the Eunuche, till they had buried his bodie in the emptie vawts of their hungry bowels: then with their teeth lately imbrued in bloud, rent the Eunuches steed into a thousand peices: which being done, they came to the Ladie, which sate quaking halfe dead with feare, and like two Lambs couched their heads vpon her lap, where with her hands shee stroked downe their brisled haire, not daring almost to breathe, till a heauie sleepe had ouer-mastered their refreshed sences: by which time, the princely minded Chapion Saint George returned with a piece of venison vpon ye point of his sword; who at that vnexpected sight, stood in a maze, whether it were best to flie for safegard of his life, or to venture his fortune against the furious Lyons. But at last, the loue of his Lady so incouraged him to a forwardnesse, which hee beheld quaking before the dismall gates of death. So laying downe his venison, hee presently like a victorious Champion, sheathed his approued fauchion most furiously into the bowels of one of the Lions. Sabra kept the other sleeping in her lap, till his prosperous hand likewise dispatched him: which aduenture being performed, he first thanked heauen for the victorie, and then in this kinde maner saluted his Lady: Now Sabra (said he) I haue by this sufficiently proued thy true virginitie: for it is the nature of euery Lion, bee hee neuer so furious, not to harme the vnspoted virgin, but humbly to lay his brisled head vpon a maidens lap. Therefore, divine Paragon, thou art the worlds cheife wonder for loue and chastity, whose honoured vertues shall ring as farre as euer Phoebus lends his light, and whose constancy I will maintaine in euery land where I come, to be the truest vnder the circuit of the Sunne: at which word hee cast his eye aside, and beheld the bloudy spectacle of the Eunuches Tragedie, which by Sabra was wofully discoursed, to the great greife of Saint George , whose sad sighes serued for a dolefull knell to bewayle his vntimely death: but hauing a noble minde not subiect to vaine sorrow, where all hope of life is past, ceased his greife, and prepared the venison in readinesse for his Ladies repast, which in this order was dressed. He had in his pocket, a fire-locke, wherewith he stroke fire, and kindled it with sunne-burned mosse, and increased the flame with other drye wood which hee gathered in the wildernesse: against which they rosted the venison, and sufficed themselues to their owne contentments. After which ioyfull repast, these two Princely persons set forwards to their wonted trauailes, whereby the happy Guide of heauen so conducted their steppes, that before many dayes passed, they ariued in the Grecian Court, euen vpon that day, when the marriage of the Grecian Emperour should bee solemnely holden: which royall Nuptials, in former times had beene bruted into euery nation in the world, as well into Europe, as Affrica and Asia: at which honourable marriage, the brauest Knights that euer liued on earth were present: for golden fame had bruted the report thereof to the eares of the seuen Champions: into Thessalie, to Saint Denis the Champion of Fraunce, there remaining with his beauteous Eglantine : into Ciuilia, to Saint Iames the Champion of Spaine, where hee remained with his louely Celestine : to Saint Anthonie the Champion of Italie, then trauailing in the borders of Sythia, with his Ladie Rossalinde : likewise to Saint Andrew the Champion of Scotland: to Saint Pattricke the Champion of Ireland: and to Saint Dauid the Champion of Wales, who atcheiued many memorable aduentures in the Kingdome of Tartarie, as you haue heard before discoursed at large. But now, fame and smiling fortune consented, to make their Knightly atcheiuements to shine in the eies of the whole world: therefore by the conduction of heauen, they generally ariued in the Grecian Emperours Court: of whose Tilts and Turnaments therein performed, to the honour of his Nuptials, my wearie Muse is bound to discourse. How the seuen Champions ariued in Grecia at the Emperours Nuptials, where they performed many noble atcheiuements, and how after, open Warres were proclamed against Christendome, by the discouerie of many Knights, and how euery Champion departed into his owne Countrie. To speake of the number of Knights, that assembled in the Grecian Court together, were a labour ouer-tedious, requiring the pen of a second Homer : Therefore will I omit the honourable traine of Knightes & Ladyes, that attended him to ye Church: Their costly garments and glistring ornaments, exceeding the Royaltie of Hecuba , the beautious Queene of Troy: Also I passe ouer the sumptuous banquets, the honourable seruices and delicious cheare that beautified the Emperours Nuptials, with the stately Maskes and Courtly daunces, performed by many noble personages, and cheifely discourse of the Knightly atcheiuements of the seuen Champions of Christendome, whose honourable proceedings, and magnanimious Encounters haue deserued a golden penne to relate: for after some few dayes spent in Chamber sports, to the great pleasure of the Grecian Prince, the Emperour presently proclaimed a solemne Iusting to bee holden for the space of seuen dayes, in the honour of his marriage, and appointed for his cheife Champions, the seuen Christian Knights: whose names as then were not knowne by any one, except their owne attendants. Against the appointed day the Turnaments should begin, the Emperour caused a wonderfull large frame of timber worke to be erected: whereon the Empresse and her Ladyes might stand for the better view of the Tilters, and at pleasure behold the Champions encounters, most nobly performed in ye honour of their Mistresses: likewise in the compasse of the Listes were pitcht seuen Tents of seuen seuerall colours, wherein the seuen Champions might remaine till the sound of siluer Trumpets summoned them to appeare. Thus euery thing prepared in readines, fitting so great a Royalty, the Princes and Ladies placed in their seates, the Emperour with his new married Empresse inuested on their loftie thrones, strongly garded with a hundred armed Knights, the Kings Harrolds solemnely proclaimed the Turnaments, which in this most royall maner began: The first day, S. Dennis of France was appointed cheife Champion against all commers, who was called by the title of the golden Knight, who at the sound of the Trumpet entered the Lists: his Tent was of the colour of the Marigold, vpon the top an artificiall Sunne framed, that seemed to beautifie the whole assembly: his horse of an Iron Gray, grac't with a spangled plume of feathers: before him rode a Page in purple silke, bearing vpon his Crest three golden Floure de luces , which did signifie his Armes: Thus in this royall maner entered S. Dennis the Listes: where after he had traced twice or thrice vp and downe, to the open view of the whole company, hee prepared himselfe in readinesse to begin the Turnament: against whome ran many Grecian Knights, which were foyled by the French Champion, to the wonderfull admiration of all the beholders: but to bee breife, he so worthily behaued himselfe, and with such fortitude, that ye Emperour applauded him for the brauest Knight in all the world. Thus in great royalty, to the exceeding pleasure of the Emperour, was the first day spent, till the darke Euening caused the Knights to breake off company, and repaire to their nights repose. But the next morning no sooner did Phoebus shew his splendant brightnes, but the King of Harrolds vnder the Emperour, with a noyse of trumpets awaked the Champions from their silent sleepe, who with all speed prepared for the second daies exercise. The cheife Champion appointed for that day, was the victorious Knight S. Iames of Spayne: which after the Emperour with his Empresse had seated themselues with a stately traine of beautifull Ladies, entred the Lists vpon a Spanish Gennet betrapt with rich Caparison: his Tent was pitcht directly ouer-against the Emperours throne, which was of the colour of Quick siluer, whereon was portrayed many excellent deuices: before the Tent attended 4. Squires, bearing foure seuerall Scutchions in their hands, whereon were curiously painted the 4. Elements: likewise he had the title of the siluer Knight, who behaued himselfe no lesse worthy of all Princely commendations, then the French Champion the day before. The third day S. Anthonie of Italy was cheife challenger in the Turnament, whose Tent was of the colour of the skies, his Steede furnished with costly Habilliments: his Armour after the Barbarian maner, his shield plated round about with steele, whereon was painted a golden Eagle in a field of blew: which signified the auncient Armes of Rome: likewise hee had the title of the Azurde Knight, whose matchlesse Chiualtrie for that day wan the prize from all the Grecian Knights, to the great reioysing of his Ladie Rossalinde , the King of Sycils Daughter, that still remayned in Pages attyre, wherein (for the deare loue shee bore S. Anthonie ) disguisedly stole from the Court, whose discouerie shall hereafter bee expressed. The fourth day, by the Emperours appointment, the valiant and worthie Knight S. Andrew of Scotland obtayned that honour, as to bee cheife challenger for the Turnament: his Tent was framed in the manner of a Ship, swimming vpon the waues of the Sea, inuironed about with Dolphins, Tritons, and many strange contriued Maremayces: vppon the toppe stoode the picture of Neptune , the God of the Seas, bearing in his hand a Streamer, whereon was wrought in Crimson silke a corner Crosse, which seemed to be his Countries Armes: hee was called the red Knight, because his Horse was couered with a bloudie vale, his worthie atcheiuements obtayned such fauour in the Emperours eyes, that he threw him his siluer Gauntlet, which was prized at a thousand Portegues, and with his owne hands conducted him to a rich Pauillion, where, after his noble encounters hee enioyed a sweete repose. The fift day S. Patricke of Ireland, as cheife Champion, entred the Lists, vpon an Irish Hobbie, couered with a vale of greene, attended on by sixe Siluane Knights: euery one bearing vpon his shoulder a blooming tree: his Tent resembled a Summers bower, at the entrie whereof stoode the picture of Flora beautified with a wreath of sweete smelling Roses: hee was named the greene Knight, whose worthie prowesse so daunted the defendants, that before the Turnament began, they gaue him the honour of the day. Upon the sixt day, the heroycall and noble minded Champion of Wales obtayned such fauour at the Emperours hands, that he was likewise cheife Challenger, who entred the Listes vppon a Tartarian Palfray, couered with a vale of blacke, to signifie, a blacke and tragicall day should befall to those Grecian Knights, that durst approue his inuincible fortitude: his Tent was pitcht in the maner and forme of a Castle in the west side of the Lists: before the entrie whereof, hung a golden shield, whereon was liuely portrayed a siluer Griffon rampant vpon a golden Helmet, which signified the Ancient armes of Britaine: his Princely atcheiuements, not onely obtained due commendations at the Emperours hands, but of the whole assembly of Grecian Ladyes, whereby they appllauded him to be the most noble Knight that euer shiuered Launce, and the most fortunate Champion that euer entred into the Grecian Court. Upon the seuenth and last day of these honourable Turnaments and most noble proceedings, the famous and valiant Knight at Armes, S. George of England, as cheife chalenger, entred the Lists, vpon a Sable coloured Steede, betrapt with barres of burnisht gold, his forehead beautified with a gorgeous plume of purple feathers, from whence hung many pendants of gold, his Armour of the purest Lidian steele, nayled fast together with siluer plates, his Helmet ingrauen very curiously, beset with Indian pearle, and Iasper stones: Before his brest-plate hung a siluer Table in a dammaske Scarfe, whereon was pictured a Lyon rampant in a bloudie field, bearing three golden Crownes vpon his head: before his Tent stood an Iuorie Chariot garded by twelue coleblacke Negars, wherein his beloued Ladie and Mistresse Sabra , sate inuested vpon a siluer Globe, to behold the heroycall encounters of her most noble and magnanimious Champion S. George of England: his Tent was as white as the Swans feathers, glistring against the Sunne, supported by foure ioyntlesse Elephants framed of the purest brasse, about his Helmet he tyed a wreath of Uirgins hayre, where hung his Ladies gloue, which he wore to maintayne her excellent gifts of nature to exceede all Ladies on the earth. These costly habilliments rauished the beholders with such vnspeakable pleasure, that they stood gazing at his furniture, not able to withdrawe their eyes from so heauenly a sight. But when they beheld his victorious encounters against the Grecian Knights, they supposed him to bee the inuincible tamer of that seuen headed monster that clambred to the Elements, offring to pull Iupiter from his throne. His Steede neuer gaue encounter with any knight but he tumbled horse and man to the ground, where they lay for a tyme bereaft of sence. The Turnament endured for that day, from the Suns rising, till the coleblacke Euening starre appeared: in which time he conquered fiue hundred of the hardiest Knights then liuing in Asia, and shiuered a thousand Launces, to the wonderfull admiration of the beholders. Thus were the seuen dayes brought to end by the seuen worthie Champions of Christendome, in reward of whose noble atcheiuements, the Grecian Emperour (being a man that highly fauored knightly proceedings) gaue them a golden tree with seuen branches, to be deuided equally amongst them. Which honourable prize they conueyed to S. Georges Pauillion, where, in diuiding the branches, the seuen Champions discouered themselues each to other, and by what good fortune they ariued in the Grecian Court, whose long wished sights so reioyced their hearts, whereby they accounted that happy day of meeting, the ioyfullest day that euer they beheld. But now after the Turnaments were fully ended, and the Knights rested themselues some few dayes, recouering their wonted agilitie of bodie, they fell to a new exercise of pleasure, not appearing in glistring Armour before the Tilt, nor following the loud sounding Drums and siluer trumpets, but spending away the time in Courtly daunces amongst their beloued Ladies and Mistresses, in more royaltie then the Phrygian Knights, when they presented the Paragon of Asia with an inchanted Maske. There wanted no inspiring Musicke to delight their eares, no heauenly Sonets to rauish their sences, nor no curious daunces to please their eyes. Sabra shee was the Mistresse of the Reuels, who grac't the whole Court with her excellent beautie, which seemed to exceede the rest of the Ladies in fayrenesse, as far as the Moone surpasseth her attending stars in a frosty night: and when shee daunst, shee seemde like Thetis tripping on the siluer sands, with whom the Sunne did fall in loue: and if shee chaunst to smile, the cloudie Elements woulde cleare and drop down heauenly dew as though they mourned for loue. There likewise remayned in the Court the sixe Scythian Uirgins, that in former time liued in the shape of Swans, which were as beautifull Ladies as euer eye beheld: also many other Ladyes attended the Empresse, in whose companies the seuen Champions dayly delighted: sometimes discoursing of amorous conceites: other times delighting themselues with sweete tuned Musicke: then spending the day in banquetting, reuelling, dauncing, & such like pastimes, not once iniuring their true betrothed Ladies. But their Courtly pleasures continued not long, for they were suddenly dashed with a present newes of open warres proclaimed against Christendome, which fell out contrarie to the expectation of the Christian Knights. There ariued in the Grecian Emperours Pallace, a hundred Harrolds of a hundred seuerall Prouinces, which proclaimed vtter defiance to all Christian Kingdomes, by these words: We the high and mightie Emperors of Asia and Affrica, great commaunders both of land and Seas, proclaime by generall consent of all the Easterne Potentates, vtter ruine and destruction to the Kingdomes of Christendome, and to all those nations where any Christian Knights are harbored: First the Souldan of Persia, in reuenge of a bloudie slaughter done in his Palace, by an English Champion. Ptolomie the Egyptian King, in reuenge of his daughter violently taken away by the said Knight: Almidor the blacke King of Moroco, in reuenge of his Queene likewise taken away by the said English Champion: The great Gouernour of Thessaly, in reuenge of his daughter taken away by a French Knight: The King of Ierusalem, in reuenge of his daughter taken away by a Spanish Knight: The Tartarian Emperour, in reuenge of his sonne the Countie Palatine, slaine by the vnhappie hand of the champion of Wales: The Sicilian Monarke, in reuenge of his vaine trauaile after his seuen daughters, now in the keeping of certaine Christian Knights: in reuenge of which iniuries, all the kingdomes from the furthest part of Prester Iohns Dominions, to the borders of the red Seas, haue set downe their hands and seales to be aiders in this bloudy warre. This Proclamation was no sooner ended, but the Grecian Emperour likewise consented to their bloudy determination, and thereupon gaue speedy commaundment to muster vp the greatest strength that Grecia could afford, to ioyne with the Pagans, to the vtter ruine and confusion of Christendome: which bloudy edict, or rather inhumane iudgemet pronounced by the accursed Infidels, compelled the Christia Champions to a speedy departure, & euery one to haste to his owne country, there to prouide for ye Pagans entertainment: so after due considerations, the 7. Chapions departed, in copany of their betrothed Ladies, who chose rather to liue in their husbands bosoms, the with their misbeleeuing parents: where after some few dayes they arriued in the spacious bay of Portingall, in which Hauen they vowed by the honour of true Knighthood, to meet againe within sixe months insuing, there to conioyne all their Christian Armes into one Legion: vpon which plighted resolution, the worthie Champions departed one from another: S. George into England: S. Dennis into Fraunce: S. Iames into Spaine: S. Anthonie into Italy: S. Andrew into Scotland: S. Patricke into Ireland: S. Dauid into Wales, whose pleasant bankes they had not beheld in many a yeere before: where their entertainments were as honourable as their hearts desired. but to speake of the mustering vp of Souldiers in euery Christian Kingdome, and what strength ariued at the appointed time in the bay of Portingall, shalbe discoursed in the sequall of this Historie, and how troublesome warres ouerspread the whole earth, where the heroycall deedes of these noble Champions shal at large be described: Also of the ouerthrow of many Kings & Kingdomes, ruines of townes and Citties, and the decay of many flourishing Commonweales: Likewise of the bloudie Tragedies of many vnchristian Princes: where at the heauens will mourne, to see the effusion of bloud trickle fron the breastes of murthered infants, the heapes of slaughtered Damsels trampled to peeces by Souldiers horses, and the streetes of many a Citie sprinckled with the bloud of reuerend age: Therefore gentle Reader, accept of this my labour with a smooth brow and a kind countenance, and my weary Muse shall neuer rest, till I haue finished the true Historie of these heroycall Champions. How the seuen Champions of Christendome ariued with their troupes in the bay of Portingall, the number of the Christian Armies, and how Saint George made an Oration to his Souldiers. After the seuen Champions of Christendome ariued in their natiue Countryes, and by true reports had blazed abroade to euery Princes eare, the bloudy resolution of the Pagans, and how the Prouinces of Affrica and Asia, had mustred vp their forces to the inuasion of Europe: All Christian Kings then at the intreaty of ye Champios, appointed mighty armies of well approued souldiers both by sea & land, to intercept the Infidels wicked intention. Likewise by the whole consent of Christendome, the Noble and fortunate Champion of England, Saint George , was appointed cheife Generall, and principall leader of the Armies, and the other sixe Champions elected for his Councell, and cheife Assistants in all attempts that appertayned either to the benefit of Christendome, or the furtherance of their fortunate proceedings. This Honourable warre so fired the hearts of many youthfull Gentlemen, and so encouraged the mindes of euery common soldier, that some morgag'd their lands, and at their owne proper charges furnished themselues. Some sold their Patrimonies, to serue in these honourable warres: and othersome forsooke parents, kindred, wife, Children, friends and acquaintance, and without constraint of pressing, offred themselues to follow so noble a Generall, as the renowmed Champion of England, and to spend their bloud in the iust quarrell of their natiue Countrie. To bee briefe, one might beholde the streetes of euery Towne and Cittie throughout all the Dominions of Europe, beautified with troupes of souldiers, which thirsted after nothing but Fame and Honour. Then the ioyfull sound of thundring Drums, and the ecchoes of siluer Trumpets summoned them to Armes, that followed with as much willingnes, as the Grecians followed Agamemnon to the wofull ouerthrow of Troy: for by that time the Christian Champions had sported themselues in the bosomes of their kinde mistresses, the forward Captaines taken leaue of their Courtly pastimes, & the willing souldiers taken leaue of their friends and acquaintance, the Spring had couered the earth with a new liuerie; which was the appointed time the Christian armies should meete in Portingall, there to conioyne their seuerall troupes into one Legion: which promise caused the Champions to bid adue to their natiue Countryes, and with all speed to buckle on their furnitures, and to hoyse vp sayles, where after a short time, the winde with a calme and prosperous gale, cast them happily into the Bay of Portingall. The first that ariued in that spatious Hauen, was the noble Champion S. George , with a hundred thousad of couragious English souldiers, whose forwardnes betokened a fortunate successe, and their willing mindes, a ioyfull victorie. His Armie being set in battell ray, seemed to counteruaile the number of the Macedonian souldiers, where with worthy Alexander conquered ye westerne world: his horsemen being in number 20000. were armed all in blacke Corslets: their Launces bound about with plates of steele: their Steeds couered with Maile three times doubled: their colours were the sanguine Crosse, supported by a golden Lion: his sturdy bowmen, whose conquering gray-goose wing in former times hath terrified the circled earth, being in number likewise twentie thousand, clad all in red Mandilians, with caps of the same colour, bearing thereon likewise a sanguine Crosse, being the true badge and honour of England: their Bowes of the strongest yewe, and their Arrowes of the soundest Ash, with forked heads of steele, and their feathers bound on with greene waxe and twisted silke. His Muskettiers being in number ten thousand, their Muskets of the widest bore, with firelocks wrought by curious workemanship, yet of such wonderfull lightnes, that they required no rest at all to ease their headdy ayming armes. His Caliuer shotte likewise ten thousand, of the smaller timbred men, but yet of as couragious a mind, as the tallest souldier in his armie. His Pikes and Billes, to gard the wauing Ancients, thirtie thousand strong, clad all in glistering bright Armour: likewise followed ten thousand labouring Pioners, if occasion serued, to vndermine any towne or castle to intrench Forts or Sconces, or to make a passage thorow hilles and mountaines, as worthy Hannibal did, when as he made away for his Souldiers thorow the lofty Alpes, that deuide the Countries of Italie and Spaine. The next that ariued within the bay of Portingall, was the Princely minded Champion S. Dauid of Wales, with an armie of fiftie thousand of true borne Britaines, furnished with all habilliments of warre to so noble and valiant a seruice, to the high renowme of his countrey, and true honor of his progenie: their Armour in richnes nothing inferiour to the Englishmens: their colours were a golden Crosse, supported by a siluer Griffon: which Scutchion signified the ancient Armes of Wales: for no sooner had S. George a sight of the valiant Brittaines, but he caused his Muskettiers presently to entertaine them with a vollue of shot, to expresse their happy and ioyful welcome to shore, which speedily they performed so couragiously with such a rattling noyse as though the firmaments had burst in sunder, and the earth made eccho to their thundring melodie. But no sooner were the skies cleared from the smoake of the reaking powder, and that Saint George might at pleasure discerne the noble and magnanimious Champion of Wales, who as then rode vpon a milke white Hobbie in siluer Armour, garded with a trayne of Knightes in purple vestures: but hee greeted Saint Dauid with kind curtesies, and accompanied him to the English Tent, which they had erected close by the port side, where for that night these two Champions remayned, spending the time with vnspeakable pleasure: and so vppon the next day after, S. Dauid departed to his owne Tent, which hee had caused to bee pitcht a quarter of a League from the English Armie. The next that ariued on the fruitfull bankes of Portingall, was S. Patricke , the noble Champion of Ireland with an Armie likewise of fiftie thousand, attyred after a strange and wonderfull maner: their furnitures were of the skinnes of wilde beasts: but yet more vnpierceable then the strongest Armour of proofe: they bore in their hands mightie Dartes, tipt at the end with pricking steele, which the couragious and and valiant Irish souldiers by the agilitie of their armes, could throwe a quarter of a mile, and with forcible strength, that they would strike three or foure inches into an Oake, and with such a certaine ayme, that they would not misse the breadth of a foote. These aduenturous and hardie Souldiers no sooner ariued on the shore, but the English Musketiers gaue them a Princely entertaynement, and presently conducted the noble minded Champion, Saint Patricke , to the English Tent, where the three Champions of England, Wales, and Irelande passed away the time with exceeding great Royaltie: laying downe plots howe to pitch their campes to the most disaduantage of the misbeleeuing enemie, and setting downe perfect directions which way they were best to march, and such like deuices for their owne safties, and the benefite of Christendome. The next that landed on the bankes of Portingall, was S. Andrew the worthy Champion of Scotland, with threescore thousand of well approued Souldiers: his horsemen, the bolde aduenterous Gallowayes, clad all in quilted Iackets, with Launces of the Turkish fashion, thicke and short, bearing vpon their Beauers the Armes of Scotland, which was a corner Crosse supported by a naked Uirgin: his Pikemen the stiffe and hardie men of Orcadie, which continually vse to lie vpon the freezing Mountaynes, the Isie rockes, and the Snowie vallies: his shot the light footed Callidonians , that if occasion serue, can clime the highest hill, and for nimblenesse in running, ouer goe the swift footed Stag. These bold aduentrous Scottishmen in all forwardnes, deserued as much honour at the English Champions handes as any of the other nations before: therefore hee commaunded his shot, at the first entry on land, to giue them a noble entertainement: which they performed most royally, and also conducted S. Andrew to the English Tent, where, after he had giuen S. George the courtesie of his country, departed to his Tent, which was distant from the English Tent a mile. The next that ariued was S. Anthonie the Champion of Italy, with a band of foure score thousand braue Italian Souldiers, mounted on warlike Coursers, euerie Horseman attended on by a naked Neger, bearing in his hand a streamer of watchet silke, with the Armes of Italy thereon set in gold, euery footeman furnished with approoued furniture, in as stately a manner as the Englishmen, who at their landing receiued as royall an entertainement, as the other nations: and likewise S. Anthonie was as highly honoured by the English Champion, as any of the other Christian knights. The next that ariued was S. Denis the victorious Champion of Fraunce, with a band of foure score thousand. After him marched twelue Dukes, of 12. seuerall Dukedomes, being then vnder the gouernement of the French King, euery one at his owne proper cost and charges, maintayning two thousand Souldiers, in these Christian warres: their entertainements were as glorious as the rest. The last of all the Christian Champions that ariued vpon the fruitfull bankes of Portingall, was the magnanimious Knight S. Iames of Spayne, with a band likewise of fourescore thousand: with him hee brought from the Spanish Mines ten tun of refined gold, onely to maintaine Souldiers in the defence of Christendome: who no sooner landed with his troupes, but the other sixe Champions gaue him the honorable welcome of a Souldier, and ordayned a solemne banket for the generall Armies, whose number iustly surmounted fiue hundred thousand: which Legions they conioyned into one Campe royall, and after placed their wings and Squadrons battell wise, cheifely by the direction of S. George , being then cheife generall by the consent of the Christian Kings: who after he had ouerviewd the Christian Armies, his countenance seemed to prognosticate a Crowned victorie, and to foretell a fatall ouerthrow to the misbeleuing potentates: Therefore to incourage his princely followers, to perseuere in their wonted willingnes, pronounced this princely Oration: You men of Europe (sayd he) and my Countrymen, whose conquering fortunes neuer yet haue feared the enemies of Christ, you see we haue forsooke our natiue Lands, and committed our destinies to the Queene of chance, not to fight in any vniust quarrell, but in the true cause of Israels anointed, not against nature to climbe the heauens, as Nemrod and the Gyants proffered in former times: but to preuent the inuasion of Christendome, the ruines of Europe, and the intended ouerthrow of all Christian prouinces: the bloudie minded infidels haue mustred vp legions, in numbers like the blades of grasse, that grow vpon the flourishing downes of Italy, or the stars of heauen in the coldest winters night, protesting to fill our Countries with Seas of bloud, to scatter our streetes with mangled limbs, and conuert our glorious Cities into flames of quenchlesse fire: Therefore deare Countrymen, liue not to see our Christian virgins spoyled by lustfull rape, nor dragde along our streetes like guiltlesse Lambes to a bloudie slaughter: Liue not to see our harmelesse babes, with brused braines dasht against hard flintie stones, nor liue to see our vnlustie age, whose hayres resemble siluer Mines, lie bleeding on the Marble pauements: But like true Christian Souldiers fight in quarrell of your Countries: What though the Pagans be in number ten to one: yet heauen I know will fight for Christendome & cast them downe before our faces, like drops of Aprill showers. Be not dismaid to see their men in ordered rankes, nor feare not, when you behold the streamers houering in the wauing wind, when as their steeled Pikes like to a thornie Forrest will ouerspread whole countries: thousands of them I know will haue no heart to fight, but flye with cowardly feare like flockes of sheepe before the greedie Wolfe. I am the leader of your noble minds, that neuer fought in vaine, nor neuer entered battell but returned with conquest. Then euerie one with mee build vpon this princely resolution: for Christendome fight: for Christendome we liue and die. This Souldierlike Oration was no sooner finished, but the whole Armie with a generall voyce cried, to Armes, to Armes with the victorious George of England: which noble resolution of the Souldiers, so reioyced the English Champion, and likewise incouraged the other Christian Champions with such a forwardnesse of mind, that they gaue speedie commaundement to remoue their Tents and to march with easie iournies towards Tripoly in Barbarie, where Almidor the blacke King of Moroco had his residence: In which trauaile wee must leaue for a while the Christian Armie, and speake of the inumerable troupes of Pagan Knights, that ariued at one instant in the Kingdome of Hungarie, and how they fell at variance in the election of a Generall: which ciuill mutinie caused much effusion of bloud, to the great hurt both of Affrica and Asia, as here after followeth. Of the dissention and discord that hapned amongst the Armie of the Pagans in Hungarie: the battell betwixt the Christians and the Moores in Barbarie; and how Almidor the blacke King of Moroco was sodden to death in a cauldron of boyling lead and brimstone. The irefull Pagans, after they had leuied their Martiall forces both by Sea and land, repaired to their generall place of meeting, there to conclude of the vtter confusion of Christendome: for no sooner could Winter withdraw his chill frostes from the earth, and Flora tooke possession of his place, but the Kingdome of Hungarie suffered excessiue penurie, through the numberlesse Armies of the accursed Infidels, being their appointed place of meeting: For though Hungarie of all other Countries both in Africa and Asia, then was the richest, and plentifullest of victuals to maintaine a Campe of men: yet was it mightily ouerprest and greatly burthened with multitudes, not onely with want of necessaries to relieue Souldiers, but with extreme crueltie of those bloudie minded miscreants, that through a ciuill discord which hapned amongst them, about the election of a Generall, they conuerted their vnitie, to a most inhumane slaughter, and their triumphant victorie to a dismall bloudy Tragedie: For no sooner ariued their Legions vpon the plaines of Algernos, being in length and breadth one and twentie leagues, but the King of Hungarie caused their muster Rolles to bee publikely read, and iustly numbred in the hearing of the Pagan Knights, which in this maner was proclaimed through the Campe: First bee it knowne vnto all Nations that fight in the quarrell of Affrica and Asia, vnder the conduct of our three great gods, Mahomet, Termigaunt , and Apollo , what inuincible forces be now ariued in this renowmed Kingdome of Hungarie, a land honored through the world, not onely for Armes, but curious buildings, and plentified with all maner of riches. First wee haue from the Emperour of Constantinople, two hundred thousand Turkes. From the Emperour of Grecia, two hundred and fiftie thousand. From the Emperour of Tartarie, a hundred threescore and three thousand. From the Souldan of Persia, two hundred thousand. From the King of Ierusalem, foure hundred thousand. Of Moores, one hundred and twentie thousand. Of coleblacke Negars, one hundred and fortie thousand. Of Arabians, one hundred and sixtie thousand. Of Babylonians, one hundred thirtie thousand and odde. Of Armenians, one hundred and fiftie thousand. Of Macedonians, two hundred and ten thousand. Of Siracusians, fifteene thousand sixe hundred. Of Hungarians three hundred and sixe thousand. Of Sicilians, seuenteene thousand three hundred. Of Scithians, vne hundred and fiue thousand. Of Parthians, ten thousand and three hundred. Of Phrygians, seuen thousand and two hundred. Of Ethiopians, sixtie thousand. Of Thracians, eleuen thousand. Likewise from the Prouinces of Prester Iohn , three hundred thousand of vnconquered Knights, with many other pettie Dominions and Dukedomes, whose number I omit for this time, least that I shoud seeme ouer tedious to the reader. But to conclude, such a Campe of armed Souldiers ariued in Hungarie, that might in one moneth haue destroyed Christendome, had not God defended them from those barbarous nations, and by his inuincible power confounded the Pagans in their owne practices: for no sooner had the Harrolds proclaimed through the Campe, what number of Nations ioyned their hands together, but the souldiers fell at dissention one with another, about the election of a Generall: some vowed to follow none, but the King of Ierusalem: some Ptolomie , the Egyptian King: and some the Souldan of Persia, euery one protesting, eyther to perseuere in their owne wills, or to lose their liues in the same quarrell. Thus in this maner partes were taken on all sides, not onely by the meaner sort, but by leaders and commaunders of bands; whereby the Kings and Potentates were forced to commit their wils to their souldiers pleasure. This ciuill broyle so discouraged the whole armie, that many withdrew their forces, and presently marched homewards, as the King of Moroco with his tawnie Moores and cole-blacke Negars: likewise the Souldan of Persia: Ptolomie the Egyptian King, the Kings of Arabia & Ierusalem, euerie one departed into their owne countries, cursing the time they attempted first so vaine an enterprize. The rest, not minding to pocket vp abuse, fell from brawling boasts, to down right blows, whereby grew such a sharp & bloody war, that it cost more souldiers liues, then the ciuill mutinie at the destructio of Ierusalem. Which battel by the irefull Pagans continued without ceasing, for the space of three moneths: in which encounters, the murthered infidels, like scattered corne, ouerspread the fields of Hungarie: the fruitfull valleys lay drowned in purple gore: the fields of corne consumed with flames of fire: their Townes and Citties ruinated with wasting war; wherein the fathers were sad witnesses of their childrens slaughters, and the sonnes behelde their parents reuerend haires, more whiter then tryed siluer, besmeard with clodded bloud: there might the mothers see their harmelesse babes borne vp and downe the streetes vpon souldiers Launces: there might they see their silken ornameuts and rich attyre in pooles of bloud lye swimming vp and downe: there might they see the braynes of honest Dames and pure Uirgins dasht against hard flintie stones: there might they see their Courts and Pallaces by souldiers burned to the ground: there might they see how Councellers in their scarlet gownes lay burning in the fire: there might they see how Kings and Queenes were arme in arme consumed to ashes: there might they behold and see howe melted gold in choked sinks lay euery where: there might they see the bloudiest Tragedies that euer eye behelde, and the wofulst newes that euer Christians eare heard told. In this long and bloudy warre, one sucking childe was not left aliue, to report the storie to ensuing ages, no not a souldier to carry Armes throughout the Kingdome of Hungaria, so iustly was the vengeance of God throwne vpon the heads of these misbeleeuing miscreants, that durst attempt to lift their hands against his true annoynted Nations: for no doubt but the inuincible armie of the Pagans had ruinated the borders of Europe, had not the mightie hande of God with his vnspeakeable mercie beene Christendomes defence, and confounded the Infidels in their owne ciuill warres: which bloudie and strange ouerthrowe of those vnchristian people, let vs for euer burie in the lake of obliuion, and perseuere in the fortunate proceedinges of the seuen Champions of Christendome, who had entred the borders of Barbarie, before Almidor the blacke King of Moroco, with his scattered troupes of Moores and Negars returned from Hungarie, and by fire and sword had wasted many of his cheifest Townes and Forts, whereby the Countrey was much weakened, and the Commons compelled to sue for mercie to the Champions hands, who bearing true Christian minds, within their hearts continually pitty harboured, vouchsafed to grant mercie to those that yeelded their liues to the pleasure of the Christian Knights: but when Saint George had intelligence of Almidors approche with his weakned troups, hee presently prepared his souldiers in readines to giue the Moores a bloudie banquet, which was the next morning by breake of day performed, to the high honor of Christendome: but the night before, the Moores knowing the country better then the Christians, got the aduantage both of wind and sunne: whereat S. George being something displeased, but yet nothing discouraged, imboldned his souldiers with many heroicall speaches, proffering them frankly the enemies spoyles, and so with the Sunnes vprising entred battell, where the Moores fell before the Christians swordes, as eares of corne before the Reapers sickles. During this conflict, the seuen Champions still in the forefront of the battell, so aduenturously behaued themselues, that they slewe more Negars, then a hundred of the brauest Knights in the Christian Armies. At last Fortune intending to make S. Georges prowesse to shine brighter then the rest, singled out the Moroco King, betwixt whom and the English Champion, was a long and dangerous fight: but Saint George so couragiously behaued him with his trustie sword, that Almidor was constrained to yeeld to his mercie. The Armie of the Moores seeing their King taken prysoner, presently woulde haue fledde: but that the Christians being the lighter of foote, ouertooke them, and made the greatest slaughter of them that euer happened in Barbarie. Thus after the battell ended, and the ioyfull sound of victorie rung through the Christian Armie, the souldiers furnished themselues with the enemies spoyles, and marched by Saint Georges direction, to the City of Tripolie, beeing then almost vnpeopled through the late slaughter which they made: in which Citie, after they had rested some few dayes, and refreshed themselues with wholsome foode, the English Champion, in reuenge of his former proffered iniuries by the Moroco King, gaue this seuere sentence of death. First, hee commaunded a brazen cauldron to bee filled with boyling lead and brimstone: then Almidor to be brought to the place of death by twelue of the Noblest Peeres in Barbarie, therein to bee consumed, flesh, bloud, and bone: which was duely performed within seuen dayes following. The brazen cauldron was erected by the appoyntment of Saint George , directly in the middle of the chiefest market place, vnder which, a mightie hote fire continually burned, for the space of eight and fortie houres: whereby the boyling lead and brimstone seemed to sparkle like the fiery furnaces in hell, and the heate to exceede the burning Ouen at Babylon. Thus all things being no sooner prepared in a readines, and the Christian Champions present to beholde the wofull spectacle, but the condemned Blackamoore King came to the place of execution, in a shirt of the finest Indian silke, his hands piniond together with a chaine of gold, and his face couered with a damaske scarfe, his attendants and cheife conducters twelue Moroco Peeres, clad in sable gownes of Taffatie, carrying before him the wheele of Fortune, with the picture of a Usurper climing vp, with this motto on his breast: I will be King in spite of Fortune : vpon the top of the wheele, the picture of a Monarch vaunting, with this motto on his breast: I am a King in spite of Fortune : Lastly on the other side of the wheele, the picture or perfect Image of a deposed Potentate, falling with his head downewards, with this motto on his breast: I haue beene a King so pleaseth Fortune : which playnely signified the chaunce of warre, and the constancie of Destinie: his gard was a thousand Christian souldiers, holding fortune in disdayne: after them attended hundred of Moroco virgins in blacke ornaments, their hayre bound vp with siluer wyers, and couered with vayles of blacke silke, signifying the sorrow of their country for the losse of their Soueraigne. In this mournefull maner came the vnfortunate Almidor to the boyling cauldon; which when hee beheld, his heart waxed cold, and his tongue deuoyd of vtterance for a time: yet at last he brake forth into these earnest protestations, proffering more for his life, then the whole kingdome of Barbarie can performe: Most mighty and inuincible Champion of Christendome (quoth hee) let my life bee ransomed, and thou shalt yeerely receyue ten tunnes of tryed gold, a hundred webs of wouen silke, the which our Indian mayds shall sit and spinne with siluer wheeles: a hundred Arguses of spices and refined sugar shall be yeerely payde thee by our Barbarie Marchants: a hundred wagons likewise richly laden with Pearle and Iasper stones, which by our cunning Lapidists shalbe yeerely chosen forth and brought thee home to England, to make that blessed countrey the richest land within the Dominions of Europe: likewise I will deliuer vp my Diademe, with all my Princely dignities, & in companie of these Moroco Lords, like bridled horses, draw thee dayly in a siluer Charriot vp and downe the circled earth, till death giues end to our liues pilgrimage: therefore most admired Knight at Armes, let these salt teares that trickle from the conduits of my eies, obtayne one graunt of comfort at thy hands; for on my bended knees I beg for life, that neuer before this time did kneele to any mortall man. Thou speakest in vaine (replyed S. George ) it is not the treasures hidden in the deepest seas, nor all the golden mines of rich America, that can redeeme thy life: thou knowest, accursed Homicide, thy wicked practises in the Egyptian Court, where thou profferedst wrongfully to bereaue me of my life: likewise through thy treachery, I endured a long imprysonment in Persia, where for seuen yeeres I dranke the channell water, and sufficed my hunger with the bread of branne meale: my foode, the lothesome fleshe of Rats and Mise, and my resting place, a dismall dungeon, where neyther the Sunne nor the cheerefull light of heauen lent me comfort during my long continued miserie: for which inhumane dealing and proffered iniuries, the heauens inforce me to a speedie reuenge, which in this maner shall be accomplished: Thou seest the engine prepared for thy death, this brazen cauldron fild with boyling lead and brimstone, wherein thy cursed body shall be speedily cast, and boyled, till thy detested limmes bee consumed to a watrie substance by this sparkling liquor; therefore prepare thy selfe to entertayne the violent stroke of death, and willingly bid all thy kingly dignities farewell: but yet I let thee vnderstand, that mercie harboureth in a Christians heart, and where mercy dwels, there faults are forgiuen vppon some humble penitence, though thy trespasse deserues no pittie, but seuere punishment: yet vpon these considerations, I will graunt thee libertie of life: First that thou wilt forsake thy false gods, Termagaunt, Mahomet , and Apollo , which bee but the vaine imaginations of men, and beleeue in our true and euerliuing God, vnder whose Banner wee Christians haue taken in hand this long warre. Secondly, thou shalt giue commaundement, that all thy Barbarous Nations be christened in the fayth of Christ. Thirdly and lastly, that thy three Kingdomes of Barbarie, Moroco, and India, sweare true allegeance to all Christian Kings, and neuer to beare Armes, but in the true quarrell of Christ and his anoynted Nations. These things duly obserued, thy life shall be preserued, and thy libertie obtayned, otherwise, looke for no mercy, but a speedy and most terrible death. These words more displeased the vnchristian King of Moroco, then the sentence of his condemnation, and in these breife speaches he set downe his resolution: Great Potentate of Europe (replied Almidor ) by whose mightines fortune sits fettred in the chaines of power, my golden Diademe, and regall Scepter by constraint I must deliuer vp: but before I forsake my countrey gods, I will endure a hundred deaths; and before my conscience be reformed to a new faith, the earth shall be no earth, the sea no sea, nor the heauen no heauen, Thinkest thou now prowd Christian, by thy threatned torments, to make mee forget my creator, and beleeue in thy false God, which was but the sonne of a Carpenter, and basely borne vnder an Oxe stall? No, no, accursed Christians, you offprings of Cayne , you generations of Ismaell , you seede of Uipers, and accursed through the world, looke for a speedy showre of vengeance to raine from heauen vpon your wicked Nations: your bloudie practises haue pierst the battlements of Ioue , and your tyrannies beaten open the gates of mightie Mahomet , who hath prouided whips of burning wyre to scourge you for your cruelties, proffered against his blessed worshippers: and now with this deadly curse I bid you all farewell: the plagues of Egypt light vpon your Kingdome: the curse of Cayne vpon your children, the famine of Ierusalem vpon your friends, and the miserie of Oedipus vpon your selues. This wicked resolution and balefull curse being no sooner ended by the desperate minded Almidor , but the impatience of S. George was so highly mooued, that hee gaue present commaundement to the appoynted executioners, to cast him into the boyling cauldron; which incontinently they performed to the terror of all the beholders: to behold this wofull spectacle, the battlements of Temples were so thronged with people, the houses couered with women and children, and the streetes filled with armed Souldiers, that it was a wonder to behold: amongst which multitudes, there were some particular persons that at the sight of Almidors death fell downe and brake their neckes: but the generall number as well of Pagans as Christians, cryed with cheerefull voyces, honour and victorie followe S. George of England, for he hath redeemed Barbarie from a miserable seruitude. Which ioyfull hearing so delighted the seuen Champions of Christendome, yt they caused their conduits to run with wine, ye streets to be beautified with bonefiers, and a sumptuous banquet to bee proclaimed thorow the Cittie, which after continued for the space of 7. dayes in more magnificent royalty, then the banquet at Babylon, when the Macedonian Monarch returned from the worlds conquest. The Champions liberalitie procured such faythfull loue in the hearts of the Moroco Peeres, that with a generall consent they chose S. George for their lawfull King: where, after they had inuested him in the princely seate of the Moroco Potentates, they set the Crowne vpon his head, and after presented him with an imperious Pall, which the Kings of Barbarie vsually wore vpon their coronation day, protesting to forsake their prophane Religion, and be christened in the fayth of Christ. This promised conuersion of the Infidels, more delighted the English Champion, then to haue the whole worlds honour at commaund: for it was the cheifest point of his Knightly othe, to aduance the faith of Christ, and to inlarge the bounds of Christendome: after his Coronation was solemnly performed, the other sixe Champions conducted him to a princely Pallace, where he tooke the true allegeace of the Moroco Lords by plighted othe to bee true to his Crowne: after this hee established Christian lawes, to the benefit of the whole Countrey: then he commaunded all the ceremonious rites of Mahomet to bee trodden vnder foote, and the true Gospell of Christ to bee preached: likewise he caused all that did remaine in Barbarie to bee christened in the new faith: But these obseruations continued but a time, as hereafter shall bee discoursed at large: For fame not intended to let the worthie Champions long to remaine in the idle Bowers of peace: but summoned them to perseuere in their noble atcheiuements, and to muster vp anew their Souldiers, whose Armour, canckered ease had almost stained with rust: therefore S. George committed the gouernment of his Countrie, to foure of the principall Peeres of Moroco, and marched towards the Countrie of Egypt, where liued trecherous Ptolomie , the Father of his beloued Ladie Sabra , whome he had left in the kingdome of England: In which iournie and happie ariuall in Egypt, wee will leaue the seuen Champions for a time, and speake of the faithlesse infidels in Barbarie, after the departure of the Christians, whose former honours they sleightly regarded: For no sooner had S. George with his martiall troupes bidden their Countrie adue, but the faithlesse Moores reconciled themselues to their former gods, and purposed a speedy reuenge for the death of Almidor , against all Christians that remained within the limits of that heathen nation: For there were many Souldiers wounded in the late battell: Likewise a number oppressed with sicknesse, had the Christian Champions left behinde for their better recoueries: vpon whome the barbarous Moores committed their first tyranie: for they caused the distressed Souldiers to be drawn vpon sleds to the vttermost part of the Citie, and there put them into a large and old Monasterie, which they presently set on fire, and most inhumanely burned the Christian Souldiers, and after conuerted the place into a filthie leastall: many women and succourlesse children they dragged vp and downe the streetes, till their braines were dasht against the stones, and the bloud had couered the earth with a purple hue: Many other cruelties were committed by the wicked Infidels, against the distressed Christians, which I purpose to passe ouer, and wholy discourse of the wofull and bloudie murther of an English Marchant and his wife, in the same Cittie of Tripoly: the report whereof may force ye mercilesse Tygers to relent, and those eyes to shead a spring of teares that neuer wept before. The bloudy minded Negars violating both othe and promise before plighted to S. George , by violence set vpon the Marchants house, where first they made a massacre of his seruants, and before his face cast their dead bodies to hunger-starued Dogges: then comming to the Marchant, they bound him fast with hempen cords, to the strongest post in his house, and after tooke his children, being seuen of the goodliest boyes, that euer nature framed, and likewise tied round about him. Then one of the Moores being crueller then the rest, proffered to deflowre the Marchants wife before his face: but shee in chastity like Cama , chusing rather an honorable death then an infamous life, spit in the Negars face, and most bitterly reuiled him, yeelding neither to his force, nor his bloudie threats: but snatching a knife fro his girdle, vowed to sheath it in her bosome, before shee would lose that precious gemme of honour, that once being gone, cannot be recouered for all the worlds treasure. This resolution of the English Marchants wife, caused the sterne Negar to exceede in crueltie: but the principall of that wicked company, being a bloudy and mercilesse tyrant, stabbed one of the silly children before the mothers face. Now stubborne Dame (quoth hee) wilt thou yeeld to my desires, and preserue the liues of the other sixe children? Otherwise shalt thou behold them butchered in the same maner. To sell my honour for the liues of my children (replyed shee) will be an offence to God, and a continuall corrasiue to my husbands heart if we liue together: Therefore, accursed monsters, prosecute your tyrannie: It is not all your threats and bloudie dealinges shall conuert my chast mind, nor once inforce my thoughts to giue any consent thereunto. These wordes being no sooner ended, but the lustful Moore tooke another of her children, and stabbed before her husbands face, thinking thereby to force the Marchant to intreate his wife to consent to the wicked Negars determinations: but he being as resolute as his vertuous wife, spake in this maner: O you cursed blacke Dogs of Barbarie, more worse in qualitie then the bloudie Tigers, and more mercilesse then the wicked Cannibals! thinke you that the murther of our children shall inforce our harts to yeeld to your lustful desires No, no, perseuere in your tyrannies: if I had a hundred children, twise the number of King Priams , yet would I loose them all, before I will indure to see my wiues dishonor: children may be gotten againe, but her honour neuer recouered. These words pricked the Negars to the gall, and caused them to commit the wickedst deede that euer was practised vnder the celestiall Globe of heauen: First they sheathed their Poniards in the breasts of all the Marchants children, whose guiltlesse bloud stayned all the Chamber with a crimson colour: then with their Fauchions did they cut their bodies all in sunder, and caused seuen Pies to be made of their flesh, and after serued in a banquet to their wofull parents, whom the mercilesse Moores set at a square table, the Marchant placed directly opposite against his wife, where they were constrayned eyther to feede vpon their owne children, or starue for want of other sustenance. This wofull spectacle strooke such a greife into the English Marchants heart, that he could scarce indure to speake for weeping: his wife, when shee beheld the heads of her louely Sonnes lying vpon the table, as it were looking to heauen for reuenge, breathed forth this wofull dying lamentation: O silly babes, I would you had beene stangled in my wombe at your first conception: then should not these accursed infidels haue triumpht thus in your vnhappy Tragedies: nor your vnfortunate parentes behelde this lucklesse day: whereon I pray that neuer Sunne may shine againe, but be accounted an ominous day throughout the whole earth: for heauen I hope (poore babes) will raigne a showre of vengeance on their heads, that haue caused this your vntimely death: and with this prayer I bid the world farewell. At which words her greife so exceeded the bounds of reason, that it stayed the passage of her speech: whereby she was forced to yeeld her soule to the Paradice of peace. Shee being no sooner dead, but the sorrowfull marchant likewise bitterly exclaymed against the iniustice of Fortune, and the tyranny of the barbarous Moores, accounting his destinie more haples then the Thracian Kings, that buried his children in his owne bowels: and the cruelties of the infidels to exceede the tyranny of Nero , that caused his mothers wombe to be opened, that he might behold the place of his creation: but when the Marchant had sufficiently bewayled the murther of his children, the death of his wife, and his owne miserie, hee yeelded his soule likewise to the furious stroke of death: The end of whose long languishments when the wicked Moores had intelligence, they caused their dead bodies to bee carried to the top of a high mountaine, and there left for the pray of hungrie Rauens: But God most miraculously preserued them both from the furie of foules, and the violence of rauenous beastes: for the Sunne consumed their bodies like the mornings dew, and by the wonderfull workmanship of heauen, in the same place sprung a bower of Roses, to signifie the vnspotted honour of the Marchant and his vertuous wife: which myracle we leaue to the wonder of the Moores, and speake of the Christian Champions proceedings, that by this time were ariued in the Kingdome of Egypt. How the Christians ariued in Egypt, and what happened to them there. The Tragedie of the lustfull Earle of Couentrie. How Sabra was bound to a stake to bee burned, and how Saint George redeemed her. Lastly, how the Egyptian King cast himselfe from the toppe of a Towre, and broke his necke. During the time of the bloudie murther wrought by the barbarous Moores vppon the English Marchant and his wife, with his seuen children, as you heard in the former Chapter, the Champions of Christendom ariued vpon the Territories of Egypt where they supposed to haue met with legions of armed souldiers, and to haue aduentured their liues vpon the chaunce of warre: but all thinges fell out contrary to their expectations: for they founde the gates of euery Citie set open, and euery Uillage and Towne vnpeopled: for the Commons at the report of the Christians ariuall, secretly hid their treasure in the caues of the earth, in deepe welles, and such like obscure places, and a generall feare and extreame terrour assayled the Egyptians, as well the Peeres of the land, as the simple countrey people: many fled into woods and wildernesses, and closely hid themselues in hollowe trees: many digged caues in the ground, where they thought best to remaine in safety: and many fled to high mountaynes, where they long time liued in great extremitie, feeding vppon the grasse of the ground: so greatly the Egyptians feared the armie of Christians, that they expected nothing but the ruine of their owne countrey, with the losse of their owne liues, and the murther of their wiues and children. But to speake of the Christian Champions, who finding the countrey desolate of people, suspected some deepe pollicie of the Egyptians, thinking them to haue mustred their generall forces to bid them battell: therefore Saint George gaue commaundement through the whole campe, that not a man vpon paine of death, should breake his ranke, but march aduisedly with three weapons readie prest to enter battell, as though the enemie had directly plaste themselues opposite against them: which speciall charge the Christian Souldiers duely obserued, looking neyther after the wealth of Cities, nor the spoyle of Uillages, but circumspectly marched according to their leaders directions along the Countrey of Egypt, till they approched the sight of King Ptolomies Court: which when the noble Champion of England beheld, in this maner encouraged hee his followers: Behold (sayd hee) you inuincible Captaines of Christendome, yonder cursed Towres where wicked Ptolomie keepes his Court, those Battlements, I say, were they as richly built as great Piramides of Greece; yet shoulde they be subuerted and layd as leuell with the ground, as the Citie of Carthage; there hath that accursed Ptolomie his residence, that for preseruing his daughter from the burning Dragon, trecherously sent mee into Persia, where, for seuen yeeres I liued in great extremitie in a dismall dungeon, where the Sunne did neuer lend mee light, nor the company of people comfort: In reuenge whereof, my heart shall neuer rest in quiet, till I see the buildings of his pallace set on fire, and conuerted into a place of desolation, like to the glorious Citie in Phrygia, now ouerspread with stinking weedes and lothesome puddles: therefore let all Christian Souldiers, that fight vnder the Banner of Christendome, and all that loue George of England your chosen Generall, drawe foorth their warlike weapons, and like the angry Greekes, ouerturne these glistring Battlements: leaue not one stone vpon another, but lay it as leuell with the ground, as the haruest reapers doe the fields of ripened corne: let your wrathfull furies fall vpon these Towres, like drops of Aprill showers, or like a storme of winters haile, that it may be bruted through the world, what lustfull vengeance did light vpon the pride of Egypt: leaue not (I say) as you loue your Generall, when you haue subuerted the Pallace, one man a liue, no, not a sucking babe, but let them suffer vengeance for the wickednes of their King. This is my decree, braue Knights of Christendome, therefore march forward: Heauen and Fortune bee your good speede. At which wordes the souldiers gaue a generall shout, in signe of their willing mindes. Then began the silken streamers to flourish in the aire, the drums cheerefully to sound forward, the siluer Trumpets recorded ecchoes of victorie: the barbed Seeds grew prowd of this attempt, and would stand vpon no ground, but leapt and daunst with as much courage, as did Bucephalus the horse of Macedonian Alexander alwayes before any not able victory; yea euery thing gaue an euident signe of good successe, as well sencelesse things as liuing creatures. With this resolution marched the Christians, purposing the vtter confusion of the Egyptians, and the wofull ruine and destruction of Ptolomies sumptuous Pallace. But when the Souldiers approched the gates with wrathfull weapons, ready to assault, there came pacing out thereat, the Egyptian King, with all the cheifest of his Nobles, attyred in blacke and mournefull ornaments, bearing in their hands Oliue branches: next them, the brauest souldiers in Egypt, bearing in their hands broken weapons, shiuered Launces, and torne Ancients: likewise followed thousands of women & children, with Lawrell wreathes about their heads, and in their hands Oliue branches, crying for mercy to the Christians, that they would not vtterly destroy their declining countrey, but shewe mercie to vnhappy Egypt. This vnexpected sight, or rather admirable wonder, caused S. George to sound retreate, and gaue commaundement through the Christian Armie, to withholde their former vowed vengeance from the Egyptians, till hee vnderstood what they required: which charge being giuen and duely obserued, S. George with the other sixe Champions came together, and admitted the Egyptian King with their powers to their presence, who in this maner began to speake for his countrey: You vnconquered Knights of Christendome, whose worthie victories and noble atcheiuements the whole world admires, let him that neuer kneeled to any man till now, and in former times disdayned to humble himselfe to the greatest Potentate on earth: let him, I say, the most vnfortunate wretch aliue, craue mercy, not for myselfe, but for my countrey: my Commons bloud will be required at my hands: our murthered Infants will call to heauen for reuenge, and our slaughtered widdowes cries sinke downe to hell for reuenge: so will the vengeance of heauen light vpon my soule, and the curse of hell vpo my head: renowmed Champion of England, vnder whose custodie my deare daughter is kept, euen for the loue of her be mercifull to Egypt. The former wrongs I proffered thee, when I sent thee like a guiltles Lambe into Persia, was contrary to my will: for I was incenst by the flatterie of that accursed Blackamoore King, whose soule for euermore bee scourged with whips of wyre, and plagued with the punishment of Tantalus in hell: if my life will serue for a iust reuenge, here is my naked brest, let my heart bloud staine some Christians sword, that you may beare the bloudy witnes of my death into Christendome: or let me be torne into a thousand peeces by mad vntamed Steeds, as was Hippolitus the sonne of Theseus in his charmed Charriot. Most mightie controulers of the world, commaund the dearest things in Egypt, they be at your pleasures, we will forsake our gods, and beleeue in that God which you commonly adore: for he is the true and liuing God, ours false, and hatefull in the sight of heauen. This penitent lamentation of the Egyptian King caused the Christian Champions to relent, but especially S. George , who hauing a heart beautified with the welspring of pittie, not onely graunted mercy to the whole Countrie, but vouchsafed Ptolomie libertie of life, vpon condition that he would performe what he had promised, which was to forsake his false gods, and beleeue in our true God, Christ Iesus. This kindnesse of S. George almost rauished Ptolomie with ioy, and the whole land: both Peeres and Commons more reioyced at the friendship of the Christians, then if they had beene made Lords of the Westerne world. The newes of this happie vnitie, was bruted in all the parts of Egypt: whereby the commons that before fled for feare into woods and wildernesses, dens and Caues, hils and mountaines, returned ioyfully to their owne dwellings, and caused bonefiers to bee made in euery Cittie, towne and village: the Bels of Egypt rung day and night, for the space of three monthes: in euery place was seene banqueting, dauncing and masking, sorrow was banished, warres forgotten, and peace proclaimed. The King at his owne charges ordained a sumptuous and costly banquet for the Christian Champions, wherein for bountie it exceeded that which the Troianes made, when Paris returned from Greece with the conquest of Menelaus Queene. The banquetting house was built with Cipresse wood, couered with the purest Adamant stone: so that neither steele nor base Iron could come therein, but it was presently drawne to the top of the roofe: as for the varietie of seruices, which graced forth the banquet, it were too tedious to repeate: but to bee breife, what both the Land and Sea could afford, were there present. The seruitors that attended the Champions at the banquet, were attired in dammaske vestments, wrought with the purest silke the Indian virgins spin vpon their siluer wheeles: at euery course the seruitors brought in, a consort of Egyptian Ladies vpon their Iuorie Lutes, strained forth such admired harmonie, that it surpassed Arions Musicke, which when hee was cast into the Sea, caused the Dolphins to bring him safe on the shore: the sweetnes of Orpheus siluer Harpe, which made both stones and trees to daunce, or the mellodie of Apollos inspiring musicke, when he descended from the heauen for the loue of Daphne . These pleasures so rauished the Christian Champions, that they forgot the sound of warlike Drummes that were wont to call them forth to bloudy battels. But these delights continued but a short time, for there ariued a Knight from England, that brought such vnexpected newes to S. George , which chaunged his ioyes into extreame sorrow: for after this maner began the messenger to tell his wofull tale. Faire Englands Champion (said he) in stead of Armes get Swallowes wings and flie to England, if euer thou wilt see thy beloued Lady, for she is iudged to be burned at a stake for murthering the Earle of Couentrie: whose lustfull desires would haue stained her honour with infamie, and made her the scorne of vertuous women: Yet this mercie is granted by the King of England, that if within foure and twentie moneths a Champion may be found, that for her sake will venture his life, and if it bee his happy fortune to ouercome the challenger of her death, shee shall liue: But if it be his fatall destinie to be conquered, then must shee suffer the heauie iudgement before pronounced: therefore as you loue the life of your chast and beloued Lady, haste into England, delay no time, for delay is dangerous, & her life in hazard to be lost. This wofull discourse strucke such a terror to S. Georges heart, likewise to the Egyptian King her father, that for atime they stood gazing one in anothers face, as though they had beene distraught of their wits, notable to speake one word, but at last S. George recouered his former sences, and breathed forth this sorrowfull lamentation: O England, vnkind England, haue I aduentured my life in thy defence, and for thy safetie haue laine in the field of Mars , buckled in my Armor, in many a partching summers day, and many a freezing winters night, when you haue taken your quiet sleepes in beds of Downe: and will you repay me with this discourtesie, or rather vndeserued wrong to adiudge her spotles bodie to consuming fire? whose bloud if it be spilt before I come, I vow neuer to draw my trusty sword in Englands quarrell more, nor neuer account my selfe her Champion, but I will rend my warlike colours into a thousand peices, the which I weare vpon my Burgonet (I meane the crimson Crosse of England) and wander vnknowne countries, obscurely from the sight of any Christians eyes. Is it possible that England is so vngratefull to her freind? Can that renowmed Country harbour such a lustfull monster, to seeke to dishonour her, within whose heart the fountayne of vertue springs? Or can the noble Citty, the nurse and mother of my life, entertaine so vile an Homicide, that will offer violence to her, whose chastitie and true honour hath caused tamelesse Lyons to sleepe in her lap? In this sorrowfull maner wearied S. George the time away, vntill the Egyptian King, whose sorrowes being as great as his, put him from his complaints, and requested the English Knight to tell the true discourse of Sabraes proffered violence, and how she murthered the lustfull Earle of Couentrie: to whom after a bitter sigh or two, the wofull messenger replyed in this manner: Most noble Princes and Potentates of the earth, prepare your eares to entertayne the wofulst tale, that euer English Knight discourst, and your eyes to weepe a Sea of brackish teares: I would I had no tongue to tell it, nor heart to remember it. But seeing I am compelled through the loue and dutie I owe to the noble Champions of Christendome to expresse it, then thus it was. It was the fortune, nay I may say, vnhappy destiny of your beloued Ladie, vpon an Euening, when the Sunne had almost lodged in the West, to walke without the wals of Couentry, to take the pleasures of the sweete fields, and flowring meddowes, which Flora had beautified in a Summers liuerie: but as shee walked vp and downe: sometimes taking pleasure to heare the mellodie of chirping Birdes, how they strayned their siluer notes: other times taking delight to see how nature had couered both hils and dales with sundry sortes of flowers: then walking to see the Christall running riuers, the murmuring Musicke of whose streames exceeded the rest for pleasure. But shee (kind Ladie) delighting her selfe by the riuers side, a suddaine and strange alteration troubled her mind: for the Chayne of gold that shee did weare about her necke, presently chaunged colour, from a yellow burnisht brightnesse, to a dimme palenes: her Rings flew from her fingers, and from her nose fell three drops of bloud: whereat her heart began to throb, her eares to glow, and euery ioynt to tremble with feare. This strange accident caused her speedily to hast homewarde: but by the way shee met the noble Earle of Couentrie, walking at that time to take the pleasure of the Euenings ayre, with such a traine of worthie Gentlemen, as though he had beene the greatest Peere in all England: whose sight when shee beheld a farre off, her heart began to misgiue, thinking that Fortune had allotted those Gentlemen to proffer her some iniurie. So that vpon her cheekes feare had set a vermillion die, whereby her beautie grew admirable: which when the Earle beheld, he was rauished therwith, and deemed her the excellentest creature that euer nature had framed: their meeting was silent: shee shewed the humilitie of a vertuous Ladie, and hee the curtesie of a kind Gentleman: shee departed homewardes, and he into the fieldes: shee thinking all danger past, but hee practised in his minde her vtter ruine and downefall: for the dart of loue had shot from her beautious cheekes into his heart, not true loue, but lust: so that nothing might quench his desire, but the conquest of her chastitie: such extreame passion bewitched his mind, that he caused his seruantes euerie one to depart; and then like a discontented man he wandred vp and downe the fieldes, beating in his mind a thousand sundry wayes how to obtaine his desire: for without hee inioyed her loue, hee was likely to liue in endlesse languishment: but at last he sighed out this passion of loue: O you immortall powers, why haue you transported her from an earthly Lady to a heauenly Angell? Sabra is no worldly creature, but a diuine substance; her beautie is a staine vnto the Queene of loue and her countenance of more maiestie, then Iunoes grace: her twinckling eyes that glister like to flaming starres, and her beauteous cheekes more pleasant then roses dipt in milke, haue pierst my heart with the prickes of loue, and her loue I will enioy, or lose my life. O, but there is a barre which thwarts kinde affections, and hinders my desires: S. George I meane, her true and lawfull husband, the honour of whose bed shee will not violate for all the Kingdomes of the world. Tush, faynt hearted foole that I am, Sabra is beautifull, and therefore to bee tempted: she is wise, and therefore easie to be wonne, her husband, hee is sporting in the fields of Mars , then why may not shee take pleasure in the chamber of Venus ? I will vse many flattering gloses, many kind speaches, and many sweete embraces, but I will crop that bud, which but to taste, I would giue my whole lands and reuenues: I will tell her, Saint George is a wanderer, and one that will neuer returne, whereas I am a mightie Peere in England, and one that can accomplish whatsoeuer she desires. Many other circumstances this lustfull Earle vsed, to flatter himselfe in this vaine conceite. At last the scowling night with pitchy cloudes began to ouerspread the brightsome heauens, whereby he was forced to repayre homewards, and to smoother vp his loue in silence. no quiet sleepe that night could enter into his eye, but fond and restles dreames: sometime he thought he had his louely Mistris in his armes, dallying like the Paphian Queene vpon her Minnions knee: but presently awaking, he found it but a gliding shadow, which added newe greife to his loue-sicke passions: then by and by he thought hee sawe how the wrathfull Champion with his dreadfull bloudie Fauchion, came to reuenge his Ladies rauishment: whereat the troubled Earle started from his bed, and with a lowd voyce cryed to his Chamberlaine for helpe, and how Saint George was come to murther him: which sudden outcry not onely awaked the Chamberlayne, but the whole house, which generally came to beare him company: they set vp Camphyre Tapers to giue light, and made him musicke to comfort him, and to driue all fond fansies from his minde: but no sooner ceased the musicke, but he fell into his former cogitations, pondering in his minde, which way hee might obtaine his purpose: whereat a dismall night-Rauen beat her wings against his Chamber windowe, and with a harsh voyce gaue him warning of a bad successe. Then presently beganne the Tapers to burne blew, as though a troup of gastly spirits did incompasse his lodging, which was an euident signe, that some strange and vnhappy murther would shortly follow. All which coulde nothing withdrawe the lustfull Earle from his wicked enterprize, nor conuert his mind from the spoyle of so sweete a Ladie. In this maner spent he the night away, till the Sunnes bright countenance summoned him from his restlesse bed; from whence beeing no sooner risen but hee sent for the Steward of his house, and gaue him a charge to prouide a most sumptuous and costly banquet, for he intended to inuite there unto, all the principal Ladies in Couentry: what bountifull cheere was prouided, I thinke it needelesse to repeat: but to be short, at the tyme and houre appoynted, the inuited Ladyes repaired: the banquet was brought in by the Earles seruants, and placed vppon the table by the Earle himselfe: who after many welcomes giuen, began thus to moue the Ladies delight: I thinke my house most highly honoured (sayd hee) that you haue vouchsafed to grace it with your presence: for mee thinkes you beautifie my hall, as the twinckling starres beautifie the vale of heauen: but amongst the number of you all, you haue a Cinthia , a glistering siluer Moone, that for brightnes exceedeth all the rest: for shee is fayrer then the Queene of Cipresse, louelier then Dido , when Cupid sate vpon her knee, wiser then the Prophetesse of Troy: of personage more comlier then the Grecian Dame, and of more Maiestie then the Queene of heauen: so that all the Muses with their Iuory pens may write eternally, and yet not sufficiently describe her excellent ornaments of nature. This commendation caused a generall smile of the Ladies, and made them looke one vpon another whom it should be. Many other Courtlike discourses pronounced the Earle to moue the Ladies delight, till the banquet ended: which being finished, there came in certaine Gentlemen by the Earles appointment, with most excellent musicke: othersome, that daunced most curionsly, with as much maiestie as Paris in the Grecian Court. At last, the Earle requested one of them to choose out his beloued Mistris, and lead her some stately Caranta: likewise requesting yt none would bee offended, what Lady soeuer hee did affect to grace with that Courtly pastime: at which request all of them were silent, and silence is commonly a signe of consentment; therefore he imboldned himselfe the more to make his desires knowne to the beholders. Then with exceeding courtesie, and great humilitie, he kissed the beautious hand of Sabra ; who with a blushing countenance and bashfull looke accepted his curtesie, and like a kind Lady disdained not to daunce with him. So when the musicians strained forth their inspiring melodie, the lustfull Earle led her the first course about the hall, in as great maiestie as Mauors did the Queene of Paphos to gaine her loue: and shee followed with as much grace, as if the Queene of pleasure had beene preset to behold their Courtly delights: and so when the first course was ended, he found a fit opportunity to vnfold his secret loue, and reueale vnto the Lady, his extreame passion of mind, which were in these speaches expressed. Most diuine and Peerelesse Paragon (said he) thou onely wonder of the world, for beautie and excellent ornaments of nature, know, that thy two twinkling eyes, that shine more brighter then the lightnesse of heauen, being the true darts of loue, haue pierced to my heart, and those thy crimson cheekes, as louely as Auroraes countenance, when shee drawes the curtaines of her purple bed to entertaine her wandring Louer, those cheekes, I say, haue wounded me with loue: therefore, except thou graunt me kinde comfort, I am like to spend the remnant of my life in sorrowe, care, and discontent: I blush to speake what I desire, because I haue setled my loue where it is vnlawfull, in a bosome where Kings may sleepe and surfet with delight, thy brest I meane, my most diuine Mistris, for there my heart is kept a prisoner, beautie is the keeper, and loue the key, my ransome is a constant minde: thou art my Venus , I will be thy Mars : thou art my Helen , and I will be thy Paris : thou art my Hyren , I will be thy Mahomet : thou art my Cressida , I will be thy Troylus : thou art my Loue, and I will be thy Paramour, Admit thy Lord and husband be aliue; yet hath he most vnkindly left thee to spend thy yong yeeres in solitarie widdowhood: he is vnconstant like Aeneas , and thou more haplesse then Dido . He marcheth vp and downe the world in his glistering Armour, & neuer doth intend to returne: he abandoneth thy presence, & lieth sporting in strange Ladies laps: therefore, deare Sabra liue not to consume thy youth in singlenes, for age will ouer take thee too soone, and conuert thy beautie to wrinkled frownes. To which words, Sabra would haue presently made answere, but that the musike called them to daunce the second course: which being ended, she replied in this maner: Most noble Lord (said she) for our bounteous banquet & courteous entertainment, I giue the humble thanks of a poore Lady. but for your suite and vnlawfull desire, I doe detest as much as the sight of a Crocodile, and your flattering gloses I esteeme as much, as doth the Ocean of a drisling showre of raine: your Syrens songs shall neuer intice me to listen to your fond requests: but I will like Vlisses stop my eares, and bury all your flattering inticements in the lake of forgetfulnes. Thinke you that I will staine his marriage bed with the least spot of infamy, that will not proffer me one thought of wrong for all the treasures of the wealthy seas? therefore the gorgious Sunne shall loose his light by day, the siluer Moone by night, the skyes shall fall, the earth shall sinke, and euery thing shall change from his kinde and nature, before I falsifie my fayth, or proue disloyall to my beloued George : attempt no more, my noble Lord, to batter the fortresse of my good name, with the gunshot of your flatterie, nor seeke to staine my honour with your lustfull desires. What if my lord and husband proue disloyall, and choose out other loues in forraine Lands? yet will I proue as constant to him, as did Penelope to her Vlisses : and if it be his pleasure neuer to returne, but spend his dayes amongst strange Ladies, then will I liue in single solitarines like to ye turtle Doue, when she hath lost her mate, abandoning all companie, or as the mournefull Swan that swimmes vpon Maeanders siluer streames, where shee records her dying tunes to raging billowes: so will I spend away my lingring dayes in greife, and die. This resolution of the vertuous Lady daunted so the Earle, that he stood like a sencelesse image gazing at the Sunne, not knowing how to replie: but yet when they had daunsed the third course, he began a new to assault her vnspotted chastitie, in these termes: Why my deare mistresse, haue you a heart more hard then Flint, that the teares of my true loue can neuer molifie? Can you behold him plead for grace, that hath beene sued vnto by many worthie Dames? I am a man that can commaund whole Countries: yet can I not command thy stubburne heart to yeeld. Diuine Sabra , if thou wilt graunt me loue, and yeeld to my desire, Ile haue thee clad in silken robes, and damaske vestures, imbost with Indian pearles and rich refined gold, perfumed with Camphire, Bisse, and Syrian sweete perfumes: by day a hundred Uirgins like to Thetis tripping on the siluer sands, shall euermore attend thy person: by night, a hundred Eunuches with their strained Instruments shall bring thy sences in a golden slumber: if this sufficeth not thy sweete content, I will prepare a sumptuous Chariot made of gold, wherein thou shalt bee drawne by Sable spotted Steedes along the fields, and gallant pastures adioyning to our Citie wals, whereas the Euening ayre shall breathe a coolenesse, farre more sweete then Balme vpon thy cheekes, and make thy beautie glister like the purple Pallace of Hiperion , when he leaues Aurora blushing in her bed, whereby the heauens and all the powers therein shall stand and wonder at thy beautie, and quite forget their vsuall courses. All this, my deare, diuine and daintie Mistresse, is at thy commaund, and more, so that I may enioy thy loue and fauour: which if I haue not, I will discontentedly end my life in woods and desert places, Tigers and vntamed beasts shall be my cheife companions. These vaine promises and flattering intisements caused Sabra to blush with bashfulnes, and to giue him this sharpe answere: Thinke you, my Lord, with golden promises, to obtaine the precious Gemme, the which I will not lose for Europs treasurie? henceforth bee silent in that enterprise, and neuer after this, attempt to practise my dishonor: which if you do, I vow by heauen to make it knowne to euery one within the Cittie, and to fill all places with rumors of thy wilfull lust: A troupe of modest maidens I will procure to haunt thee vp and downe the streetes, and wonder at thee like an Owle, that neuer comes abroad, but in the darkest nights: this I am resolued to do, and so fare well. Thus departed Sabra with a frowning coutenance; wherby the rest of ye Ladies suspected that the Earle had attempted her dishonour by secret conference, but they all assuredly knew, that shee was as farre from yeelding to his desires, as is the aged man to become young againe, or the azurde firmament to be a place for siluane beasts to inhabit. In such like imaginations they spent away the day, till the darke night caused them to breake off company. The Earle smothered his greife vnder a smiling countenace, till the Ladies were euery one departed, whome he courteously caused his seruants to conduct homewards with Torch lights, because it began to be very darke. After their departure he accursed his owne fortune, and like a Lion wanting foode, raged vp and downe his Chamber, filling euery corner with bitter exclamations, rending his garments from his backe, tearing his haire, beating his brest, and vsing all the violence he could deuise against himselfe. In this maner spent he away the night, suffering no sleepe to close the windowes of his body: such a melancholy and extreame passion discontented his minde, that hee purposed to giue an ende to his sorrowes by some vntimely death. So when the morning appeared, he made his repayre to an Orchard, where Sabra commonly once a day walked to take the ayre. The place was very melancholy, and farre from the noyse of people: where, after he had spent some certaine time in exclayming against the vnkindnesse of Sabra he pulled his Poyniard from his backe, and prepared his brest to entertayne the stroke of death: but before the pretended Tragedie, with his dagger hee ingraued these verses following, vpon the barke of a Walnut tree. O heart more hard then bloudie Tyger fell, O eares more deafe, then sencelesse troubled Seas: O cruell foe, thy rigor doth excell, For thee I die, thy anger to appease: But time will come when thou shalt find me slaine, That thy repentance will increase thy paine. I here ingraue my will and Testament, That my sad greife thou mayst behold and see: How that my wofull heart is torne and rent, And gorg'd with bloudie blade for loue of thee: Whom thou disdain'dst as now the end doth trie, That thus distrest doth suffer me to die. Oh Gods of loue, if so there any be, And you of loue that feele the deadly paine. O Sabra thou that thus afflictest me, Heare these my words, which from my heart I straine. Ere that my corps be quite bereau'd of breath, Let me declare the cause of this my death. You mountaine Nimphes which in the desarts raigne, Cease off your chase from sauage beasts a while: Prepare to see a heart opprest with paine, Addresse your eares to heare my dolefull stile: No strength nor Arte can worke me any weale, Sith shee vnkind and tyrantlike doth deale. You fairy Nimphes of louers much adorde, And gracious Damsels which in Euenings faire Your Closets leaue, with heauenly beautie storde, And on your shoulders spread your golden hayre, Record with me, that Sabra is vnkind, Within whose breast remaines a bloudie mind. Ye sauage Beares in Caues and Dennes that lie, Remaine in peace, if you my sorrowes heare, And be not moued at my miserie, Though too extreame my passions doe appeare: England farewell, and Couentry adue, But Sabra, heauen aboue still prosper you. These verses being no sooner finished, and ingrauen about the barke of the Walnut tree, but with a grisly looke & wrathful countenance he lift vp his hand, intending to strike the poyniard vp to the hilts in his brest: but at that same instant he beheld Sabra entring the Orchard to take her wonted walkes of pleasure, whose sight hindred his purpose, and caused other bloudie cogitations to enter into his mind. The furies did incense him to a wicked deede, the which my trembling tongue faints to report: for after shee had walked to the furthest side of the melancholy Orchard, he rigorously ran vnto her with his dagger drawne, and catching her about the slender waste, thus spitefully threatned her: Now stubbourne Dame (quoth hee) will I obtayne my long desired purpose, and reuenge by violence thy former proud denials: first will I wrap this dagger in thy lockes of hayre, and nayle it fast into the ground: then will I rauish thee by force and violence, and triumph in the conquest of thy chastitie: which beeing done, Ile cut thy tongue out of thy mouth, because thou shalt not reueale nor discry thy bloudie rauisher: Likewise with this Poyniard will I chop off both thy hands; whereby thou shalt neuer write with pen thy staine of honour, nor in Sampler sow this proffered disgrace. Therefore except thou wilt yeeld to quench my desired loue with the pleasures of thy marriage bed, I will by force and violence inflict these vowed punishments vpon thy delicate bodie: bee not to resolute in thy denials, for if thou beest, the gorgious Sunne shall not glide the compasse of an houre, before I obtayne my long desired purpose: and therevpon he stepped to the Orchard doore, and with all expedition locked it, and put the key into his pocket. Then returned hee like the hunger-starued Wolfe, to seyze vppon the silly Lambe: or like the chafed Bore when hee is wounded with the hunters Launce, came running to the helplesse Lady, intending her present rape, and foule dishonour: But she thinking all hope of ayd or succour to be void, fell into a dead sound, being not able to moue for the space of a quarter of an houre: But yet at last hauing recouered her dead sences to their former vitall moouing, shee began in this pittifull manner to defend her assayled chastitie, from the wicked Earle that stood ouer her with his bloudie dagger, thratning most cruelly her finall confusion. My Lord of Couentrie, (sayd shee with weeping teares, and kneeling vpon the bare ground) is vertue banished your brest? haue you a minde more tyrannous then the Tygers of Hercania, that nothing may suffice to satisfie your lustful desires but the stayne of my honour, and the conquest of my chastitie? if it be my beautie that hath intised you, I am content to haue it conuerted to a lothsome Leprosie, whereby to make me odious in your eyes: If it be my rich and costly garments that make me beautifull, and so intangle you, henceforth I will attyre my body in poore and simple aray, and for euermore dwell in Country Caues and Cottages, so that I may preserue my chastitie vnspotted. If none of these may suffice to abate your tyrannous intent, but that your lust will make mee a times wonder, and poynting stocke and scorne of vertuous Ladyes: then will the heauens reuenge my wrongs, to whome I will vncessantly make my petitions: the birds in the ayre after their kind will euermore exclayme against your wickednesse: the siluane beasts that abide in woods and deserts, will breath forth clamors of your wickednesse: the creeping wormes that liue within the creuises of the earth, will giue dumbe signes and tokens of your wickednesse: the running riuers will murmure at your wickednesse: the woods and trees, both hearbs and flowers, with euery sencelesse thing will sound some motions of your wickednesse. Returne, returne, my noble Lord, vnto your former vertues: banish such fond desires out of your minde: staine not the honour of your house with such blacke scandals and disgrace: beare this in mind before you do attempt so vile a sinne. What became of Hellens rauishment, but the destruction of renowmed Troy? What of Romane Lucresiaes rape, but the bannishment of Tarquin ? and what of Prognies foule deflowrement by her sisters husband, the lustfull King of Thrace, but the bloudie banquet of his yong Son Itis , whose tender bodie they serued to his table baked in a Pie? At which speeches the irefull Earle wrapped his hands within her lockes of hayre, which was couered with a costly Caule of gold, and in this maner presently replyed vnto her. What tellest thou me of Poets tales (sayd he?) of Prognies rape, and Terius bloudie banquet? thy rauishment shal bee an Induction to thy Tragedie, which if thou yeeld not willingly, I will obtayne by force and violence: therefore prepare thy selfe eyther to entertayne the sentence pronounced, or yeelde thy bodie to my pleasure. This vnrecanting and vowed resolution of the Earle, added greife vpon greife, and heaped mountaines of sorrow vpon her soule: twise did the haplesse Lady cast her eyes to heauen, in hope the Gods would pitty her distresse, and twise vnto the earth, wishing the ground might open and deuoure her, and so deliuer her from the furie of the wicked Homicide: but at last, when shee saw that neyther teares, prayers, nor wishes could preuaile, shee gaue an outward signe of consentment vpon some conditions, vnder colour to deuise a present meanes to preserue her chastitie, and deliuer her selfe from his lustfull assailements. There is no condition said the Earle, but I will yeeld vnto, so thou wilt graunt my desire, and make me cheife commaunder of thy loue. First, my Lord (quoth she) shall you suffer me to sit some certaine houres vpon this bed of Uiolets, and bewaile the losse of my good name, which shortly shall be yeelded vp to your pleasure: then shall you lie and dally in my lap, thereby to make my affections, yet freezing cold, to flame with burning brands of loue: that being done, you shall receiue your wished desires. These words caused the Earle to conuert his furious wrath to smiling ioy, and so casting downe his dagger, hee gaue her a courteous kisse, which shee in his conceite graciously accepted: whereby his mind was brought into such a vaine opinion, that hee thought no heauen but in her presence: no comfort but in her sight, and no pleasure but in her loue: then caused he Sabra to sit downe vpon a bed of Uiolets, beset about with diuers sorts of flowers, whose lap he made his pillow, whereon he laid his head, intending as he thought, to increase desire: But as women in extremitie haue the quickest wits: so Sabra busied her selfe by all meanes possible, either now or neuer to remooue the cause of her deepe distresse, by practising his death, and so quit her selfe from her importunate sutor: one while shee told him pleasant tales of loue, in hope to bring his sences to a slumber, the better to accomplish her desires: other whiles shee played and sported with his haire that hung dangling below his shoulders like to threds of silke: But at last when neither discoursing tales, nor her dallying pastime with his haire could bring him a sleepe, shee strained forth the Organs of her voyce, and ouer his head sung this wofull Dittie: Thou God of sleepe and golden dreames appeare, That bringest all things to peace and quiet rest, Close vp the glasses of his eyes so cleare, Thereby to make my fortune euer blest. His eyes, his heart, his sences and his mind, In peaceful sleepe let them some comfort finde. Sing sweet your prettie birds in top of skyes, With warbling tunes and many a pleasant note: Till your sweet musicke close his watchfull eyes, That on my loue with vaine desires doth dote: Sleepe on, my deare, sleepe on, my loues delight, And let this sleepe be thy eternall night. You gentle Bees, the Muses louely birds, Come aide my dolefull tunes with siluer sound: Let your inspiring melodie record, Such heauenly musicke, that may quite confound, Both wit and sence, and tyre his eyes with sleepe, That on my lap in sweete content I keepe. You siluer streames, which murmuring musicke makes, And filles eche dale with pleasant harmonie, Whereat the floting fish much pleasure takes, To heare their sweete recording melodie, Assist my tunes, his slumbring eyes to close, That on my lap now takes a sweete repose. Let whispering windes in euery sencelesse tree, A solemne, sad, and dolefull musicke sing: From hilles and dales, and from eche mountaine high, Let some inspiring sound or eccho ring, That he may neuer more a wake againe, Which sought my marriage bed with lust to staine: This delightfull song rocked his sences to such a careles slumber, yt he slept as soundly vpon her lap, as in the softest bed of downe; whereby she foud a fit opportunitie to deliuer her vndefiled body from his lustfull desires. So taking the poyniard in her hand, which he had cast a little aside, & gazing thereon with an irefull looke, she made this sad complaint: Graunt, you immortall powers of heauen (said she) that of these two extreames I choose the best: either must I yeeld my body to be dishonoured by his vnchast desires, or staine my hands with the trickling streames of his heart bloud. If I yeeld vnto the first, I shall be then accounted for a vicious Dame in euery place: but if I comit the last, I shall bee guilty of a willfull murther, and for the same, the lawe will adiudge me to a shamefull death. What, shall I feare to die, and lose my vertue and renowne? No, my heart shalbe as tyrannous as Danaus daughters, that slewe their fiftie husbands in a night: or as Medeas crueltie, which scattered her brothers bloudy ioynts vpon the sea shore, thereby to hinder the swift pursuite of her father, when Iason got the golden fleece from Calcos Ile. Therefore stand still, you glistring lamps of heauen; stay, wandring time, and let him sleepe eternally. Where art thou, sad Melpomene , that speakest of nothing but of murthers and Tragedies? Where bee those Dames that euermore delight in bloud? Come, come, assist mee with your cruelties, let mee exceede the hate of Progne for her rauishment: rage heart, and take delight in bloud, banish all thoughts of pittie from thy brest, bee thou as merciles as King Priams Queene, that in reuenge of fiue and twenty murthred sonnes, with her owne hands stained the pauements of Agamemnons Court with purple gore. These words being no sooner ended, but with a wrathfull and pale countenance, she sheathed her poyniard vp to the hilts in the closure of his brest, whereat hee started, and would haue got vp on his feete, but the streames of bloud so violently gushed from his wound, that hee declined immediatly to the earth, and his soule was forced to giue the world a dolefull adue. But when Sabra beheld the bedde of violets stained with bloud, and euery flower conuerted to a crimson colour, she sighed grieuously: but when she saw her garments all to be sprinkled with her enemies bloud, and he lay wallowing at her feete in purple gore, shee ran speedily vnto a flowing fountaine, that stood on the further side of the Orchard, and began to wash the bloud out of her clothes, but the more she washed, the more it increased: a signe that heauen will neuer suffer wilfull murther to be hid, for what cause soeuer it is done. This strange spectacle, or rather wonderfull accident, so amazed the sorrowfull Ladie, that she began anewe to complaine: O that this wicked murther neuer had beene done (said shee) or that my hand had beene strooken lame by some vnluckie Plannet, when first it did attempt the deede! Whither shall I flie, to shrowde mee from the companie of vertuous women, which will for euermore shun me as a detested murtherer? If I should go into some forraine countrey, there heauen will cast downe vengeance for my guilt: If I should hide my selfe in woods and solitarie wildernesses, yet would the wind discouer mee, and blowe this bloudy crime to euery corner of the world: or if I should goe liue in Caues, or darkesome dennes, within the deepe foundation of the earth, yet will his ghost pursue mee there, and haunt me day and night: so that in no place a murtherer can liue in rest, such discontented thoughts shall still oppresse his minde. After shee had breathed forth this comfortles lamentation to the ayre, she tore her bloud-stained garment from her backe, and cast it into the fountaine, where it turned the water into the colour of bloud: so heinous is murther in the sight of heauen. Thus being disrobed into her Petticote, she returned to the slaughtered Earle, whom she found couered with mosse, which added more greife vnto her sorrowfull soule, for shee greatly feared her murther was discried; but it fell not out as she mistrusted: for it is the nature and kind of a Robbin Red-brest and other birds, alwayes to couer the body of any dead man, and those were they that bred this feare in the Ladies heart. By this time the day began to shut vp his bright windowes, and sable night entred to take possession of the earth; yet durst not the wofull and distressed Sabra make her repaire homewards, least shee should bee discried without her vpper garment. During which time, there was a generall search made for the Earle by his seruants, for they greatly suspected some danger had befallen him, considering that they heard him the night before so wofully complayne in his chamber. At last with Torch light they came to the Orchard gate, which they presently burst open: wherein no sooner entring, but they found their murthered master lying by a bed of violets couered with mosse: likewise searching to find out the murtherer, at last they espyed Sabra in her naked petticote, her hands and face besprinkled with bloud, and her countenance as pale as ashes: by which signes, they suspected her to be the bloudie bereauer of their Lord and Masters life: therefore, because she descend from a noble linage, they brought her the same night before the King, which did then keepe his Court in the Citie of Couentrie: who immediately vpon the confession of the murther, gaue this seuere iudgement against her. First, to be conueyed to pryson, there to remayne for the tearme of twelue moneths, and at the end thereof, to bee burned like a most wicked offender: yet because she was the daughter of a King, and loyall Lady to so Noble a Knight, his Maiestie in mercy graunted her this fauour: that if shee could get any Knight at Armes, before the time were expired, that would be her Champion, and by combate redeeme her from the fire, shee should liue: otherwise, if her Champion were vanquished, then to suffer the former iudgement. Thus haue you heard the true discourse of all things which hapned till my departure from England, where I left her in pryson: and since that time fiue moneths are fully expired: therefore most renowmed Champion, as you loue the life of your Lady, and wish her deliuery, make no tariance, but with all speede post into England: for I greatly feare, before you ariue vpon the blessed shore, the time will be finished, & Sabra suffer death for want of a Champion to defend her cause. This dolefull discourse draue S. George with the other Knights and Champions, to such an extasie of minde, that euery one departed to their lodging Chambers with dumbe signes of sorrow, being not able to speake one word; where for that night they lamented the mishap of so vertuous a Lady. The Egyptian King her father, he abandoned the sight of all companies, and repayred to the top of a high tower built of Marble stone, wherein hee barred himselfe so fast with yron bolts; so that none could come within the hearing of his lametations: then raged hee vp and downe like franticke Oedipus , tearing his eyes from their naturall celles, accusing heauen of iniustice, condemning earth of iniquitie, and accursing man for such an execrable crime; one while, wishing his daughters birth-hower had beene her buriall day: another while, that some vnluckie Plannet would descend the firmament and fall vpon his miserable head. Being in this extreame passion, he neuer hoped to see his daughters countenance againe: and so about midnight, being a time when desperate men practise their owne destructions, hee cast himselfe headlong from from the top of the Tower, and broke his necke, and all besprinled the flinty pauements with his bloud and braynes. No sooner was the night vanished, and bright Phoebus entred the Zodiacke of heauen, but his brused body liuelesse and sencelesse, was found by his seruants lying in the Palace yard all to be beaten in peices against the ground. The wofull newes of this selfe-wild murtherer they presently told to certaine Egyptian Knights, who tooke his scattered limbs and caried them to S. Georges chamber, where they found him arming himselfe for his departure towards England: But at this wofull spectacle he tooke a second conceited greife in such extreame maner, that it had almost cost him his life, but that the Egyptian Knights gaue him many comfortable speaches, and by the consent of many Dukes, Earles, Lords, and Barons, with many other of the late Kings priuie Counsell, they elected him the true succeeding King of Egypt, by the marriage of Ptolomies daughter: which royall proffer S. George refused not, but tooke vppon him the regiment of the whole countrey, so that for that day his iourney towars England was stayed, and vpon the third day following, his Coronation was appoynted, which they solemnely performed, to the high honour of all the Christian Champions: for the Egyptian Peeres caused S. George to bee apparelled in royall vestures like a King: hee had on a sute of flaming greene like an Emerauld, and a mantle of scarlet very richly furd, and wrought curiously with golde: then the other 6. Champions led him vp to the Kings throne, and set him in a chayre of Ebony with the pummels of siluer, which stood vpon an Alablaster Elephant: then came three of the greatest Lords in Egypt, and set a Crowne of golde vpon his head: then followed two Knights with a scepter & a naked sword, to signifie that hee was cheife Champion of all the Realme, and Lord of all that appertayned to the Crowne of Egypt. This being performed in most sumptuous and stately maner, the Trumpets with other Instruments began to sound, whereat the generall company with ioyfull voyces cryed all together, Long liue S. George true Champion for England, and King of Egypt. Then was hee conducted to the royall Pallace, where for ten dayes he remayned amongst his Lords and Knights, spending the tyme in great ioy and pleasure; the which being finished, his Ladies distresse constrained him to a sudden departure: therefore he left the guiding of his land to twelue Egyptian Lords binding them all by oathe, to redeliuer it at his returne: likewise charging them to interre the bodie of Ptolomie in a sumptuous Toombe, befitting the bodie of so Royall a Potentate: Also, appointing the sixe Champions to rayse their Tents, and muster vp anewe their Souldiers, and with all speede march into Persia, and there by dint of bloudy warre reuenge his former iniuries vppon the cursed Souldan. This charge being giuen, the next morning by breake of day he buckled on his Armour, mounted on his swift-footed Steede, and bade his freinds in Egypt for a season adue: and so in companie of the Knight that brought him that vnluckie newes, he tooke his iourney with all speed toward England: In which trauayle wee leaue him for a time: Also passing ouer the speedie prouision made by the Christian Champions in Egypt for the inuasion of Persia, and returne to sorowfull Sabra being in pryson, awayting eache minute to receyue the finall stroke of impartiall death: for now had the rowling Plannets brought their yeeres trauayle to an end: yet Sabra had no intelligence of any Champion that would defend her cause: therefore shee prepared her delicate bodie to receyue her latest breath of life. The time beeing come, shee was brought to the place of execution, whither she went as willingly, and with as much ioy, as euer shee went beforetime vnto her marriage; for shee had made her humble submission to the world, and vnfaynedly committed her soule to God. Shee being at the stake (where the King was present with many thousands, as well of noble personages, as of common people to behold this wofull Tragedie) the deaths-man stripped off her garment, which was of blacke sarcenet, and in her snow-white smocke bound her with an yron chaine vnto the stake: then placed they round about her tender bodie, both pitch, turpentine, & gunpowder, with other mercilesse things, thereby to make her death the more easie, and her paine the shorter: which being done, the King caused the Harrold to summon in the Challenger; who at the sound of the Trumpet came trasing in vpon a Rone-coloured Steede, without any kind of marke and trapped with rich trappings of gold and precious stones of great price: there came foorth at the horse mouth, two tusks, like vnto an Elephants, his nostrels were very large and bigge, his head little, his breast somewhat broade, well pitcht, and so hard, that no sword, were it neuer so sharpe, was able to enter in thereat. The Champion was called the Baron of Chester, a bold and hardier Knight, they thought liued not then vppon the face of the whole earth: hee so aduanced himselfe vp and downe, as though he had beene able to encounter with an hundred Knights. Then the King caused the Harold to summon in the Defendant, if there were any to defend her cause: both Drums and Trumpets sounded three seuerall times vp and downe the fields, betwixt euery rest, was full a quarter of an houre, but yet no Defendant did appeare: therefore the King commaunded the executioner to set the stake on fire presently. At which words, Sabra began to grow as pale as ashes, and her ioynts to tremble like to Aspen leaues; her tongue that before continued silent, began to recorde a swanlike dying tale, and in this maner vttered she the passion of her heart: Be witnes, heauen, and all you bright celestiall Angels: bee witnes Sun and Moone, the true beholders of my fact: bee witnes, thou cleare firmament, and all the world be witnes of my innocencie: the bloud I shed was for the safegard of my honour and vnspotted chastitie: great God of heauen, if ye prayers of my vnstained heart may assaile thy mighty Maiestie, or my true innocencie preuaile with thy immortall power, commaud that either my Lord may come to be my Champion, or sad beholder of my death. But if my hands were stained with bloud about some wicked enterprise, then, heauen, shew present vengeance vpon me by fire, or else let the earth open and deuoure my body vp aliue. At which instance she heard the sound of a shrill and lowde horne, the which S. George winded: (for as then he was neere) which caused the execution a while to be deferred. At last they beheld a farre off, a stately Banner wauering in ye ayre, the which the Knight carried before S. George : then they espied neere vnto the Banner, a most valiant armed Knight mounted vpon a cole- blacke Palfray, with a mightie great Launce set against his rest: by which sudden approch, they knew him to bee some Champion that would defend the distressed Ladies cause. Then the King commanded the drums and trumpets to sound: whereat ye people gaue a generall shout, & the poore Lady halfe dead with feare, bega to reuiue, & her blushing cheeks to be as beautifull as red Roses dipt in milke, & bloud mingled with snow. But when S. George approched ye sight of his true & constant Lady, whom he found chained to a stake, incompassed with many instruments of death, his heart so relented with greife, that hee almost fell beside his horse: yet remembring wherefore hee came, he recalled his courage, and intended to trye his fortune in the combat, before he would discouer himselfe vnto his Lady. And so when the trumpets sounded deathes alarum, the two Knights set spurres to their horses, and made them run so fiercely, that at the first encounter they shiuered both their Launces to their hands: then rushed they together so rigorously with their bodies and Helmets, that they fell downe both to the earth: but S. George , who was the more lustier Knight, nimbly leapt vpon his feete without any hurt: but the Baron of Chester lay still, with his head downe wards, casting from his mouth aboundance of bloud, he was so mightily brused with the fall: but when he reuiued from his traunce, hee tooke his shield, drawing out a mightie Fawchion, and with a wrathfull countenance ran at S. George . Now proud Knight (quoth he) I sweare by all the Saints in heauen, to reuenge the bloud which thou hast shed: and therewithall he stroke so violently vpon S. Georges shield, that it cleaued quite asunder. Then began he to wax angrie, and tooke his sword in great wrath, and gaue the Baron of Chester such a stroke, that hee cut away arme and shoulder, and all the flesh of his side to the bare ribs, and likewise cut his legge almost cleane asunder in the thickest place of his thigh, and yet for all that, the sword entered halfe a foote into the earth: then fell the Baron of Chester to the ground, and breathed forth this lamentable cry: Now frowne, you fatall starres eternally, that did predominate at my birth, for he is slaine and vanquished, that neuer stoopt to any Knight before this day: and there vpon the bloud stopped the passage of his speach, and his soule went flying to Elizium : whereat the whole company reioyced, and applauded S. George for the most fortunate Knight in the world. Then the King deliuered Sabra with his owne hands to S. George , who most courteously receyued her, and like a kind Knight cast a Scarlet mantle ouer her body, the which a Lady standing by, bestowed vpon him; yet he minding not to discouer himselfe, but set her vpon his portly Steede, (that presently grew proud in carrying so rich a burthen) and with his owne hands led him by the bridle raynes. So great was the ioy throughout the Citie, that the bels rung without ceasing for three dayes together, the Citizens thorow euery place that S. George shoulde passe, did hang forth at their windowes, and on their wals, cloth of gold and silke, with rich Carpets, Cushions, and couerings of greene veluet lay abroad in euery window: the Cleargie in Copes of gold and silke, met them with solemne processions: The Ladies and beautifull Damsels strowed euery streete whereas he past, with Roses and most pleasant flowers, and crowned him with a wreath of greene bayes, in signe of his triumphant victorie and conquest. In this maner went he vnto ye kings Pallace, not knowne by any what hee should bee but that hee was a Knight of a strange Countrie: yet Sabra many times as the walked by the way, desired to see his face, and know his name, in that he had aduentured so farre for her sake, and that for her deliuerie, had vanquisht the brauest Knight in England. Yet for all her perswasions, he kept himselfe vndiscouered, till a troupe of Ladies in company of Sabra , got him into a chamber richly hung with Arras cloth, and there vnlaced his beuer: whose countenance when shee beheld, and saw that it was her Lord and husband which had redeemed her from death, shee fell into a dead sound for very ioy: But S. George sprinkled a little cold water on her face, and reuiued her presently. After this he gaue her many a kind and louing kisse, calling her the most truest, & the most loyallest Lady that euer nature framed, that to the verie death would not loose one iote of her vnspotted honour. Likewise she accounted him the truest Knight, and the loyallest husband, that euer heauenly Hymen linckt in bands of marriage with any woman. But when the King had notice that it was Saint George , his Countries Champion, which atcheiued that noble conquest in vanquishing the Baron of Chester, he was rauished with such ioy, that hee came runing in all haste to the Chamber, and most kindly imbraced him, and after hee was vnarmed, and washed his wounds in white wine and new milke, the King conducted him with his Ladie to his banqueting house, where they feasted for that Euening, and after he kept open Court for all commers so long as S. George continued there, which was for the space of one moneth: At the end whereof he tooke his Lady and one page with him, and bade England adew, and then hee trauailed towards Persia, to the other Christian Champions, whose dangerous iourney and strange aduentures you may reade in this Chapter following. How Saint George in his iournie towards Persia, ariued in a Countrie inhabited onely by maides, where he atcheiued many strange and wonderfull aduentures: Also of the rauishment of seuen Virgins in a wood, and how Sabra preserued her honour from a terrible Giant. After Saint George with his vertuous Ladie departed from England, and had trauailed through many Countries, taking their direct courses towards Egypt, and the Confines of Persia, where the other sixe Champions remained with their warlike Legions: At last they ariued in the Countrie of the Amazonians, a land inhabited by none but women: In which Region Saint George atcheiued many braue and princely aduentures, which are most wonderfull to rehearse, as after shall be declared: For trauelling vp and downe the Country, they found euery Towne and Citty desolate of people, yet verie sumptuously builded, the earth likewise vntilled, the pastures vncherished, and euery fielde ouergrowne with weedes: whereby he deemed that some strange accident had befallen the Country, eyther by warre, or mortalitie of some greiuous plague, for they could neyther set eye of man, woman, nor child, whereby they were forced to feede on berries and rootes, and in steade of braue Pallaces, they were constrayned to lie in broad pastures, vpon the bankes of mosse, and in steade of Curtaines of silke, they had the blacke and scowling clouds to couer them. In this extremitie they trauelled vp and downe for thirtie dayes: but at last it was their happie fortunes to ariue before a rich Pauillion, situate and standing in the open fields, which seemed to be the most glorious sight that euer they beheld, for it was wrought of the richest worke in the world, all of greene and crimson Satten, bordred with gold and Azure, the posts that bare it vp were of Iuorie, the cords of greene silke, and on the top thereof there stoode an Eagle of Gold, and at the two corners, two greene siluer Griffins shining against the Sunne, which seemed in richnesse to exceede the monument of Mausalus being one of the worldes twelue wonders. They had not there remayned long, admiring at the beautie of the workemanship, but at the entrie of the Pauillion, there appeared a maiden Queene crowned with an imperiall Diademe, who was the most fayrest creature that euer hee saw: on her attended twentie Amazonian Dames, bearing in their hands siluer bowes of the Turkish fashion, and at their backes hung quiuers full of golden arrowes: vpon their heads they wore siluer Coronets, beset with pearles and precious stones: their attire comely and gallant: their faces fayre & gentle to behold, their foreheads plaine and white, the tramels of their haire like burnisht gold, their browes small & proper, somewhat drawing to a browne colour: their visages playne, neyther too long nor too round, but coloured like roses mixt with Lillies, their noses long and straight, their ruddie mouthes somewhat smiling, their eyes louely, and all the rest of their parts & liniaments by nature framed most excellent, who had made them in beautie without compare: The Queene her selfe was clothed in a gowne of greene, straight girt vnto her bodie with a lace of gold, so that somewhat her round and Lilly white brest might be seene, which became her wonderfull well: beside all this, shee had on a crimson Kertle, lined with Uiolet veluet, and her wide sleeues were likewise of greene Silke, imbrothered with flowers of gold, and with rich Pearles. When S. George had sufficiently beheld the beautie of this mayden Queene, he was almost intrapped in her loue, but that the deare affection he bare to his owne Lady preuented him, whom he would not wrong for all the treasures betwixt the highest heauens, and the lowest earth. At last he alighted from his horse, and humbled himselfe vnto her Excellencie, and thus courteously began to question with her after this maner: Most diuine and fayre of all fayres, Queene of sweet beautie (sayd hee) let a trauelling Knight obtaine this fauour at your hands, that both himselfe and his Ladie whome you behold here wearied with trauell, may take our rest within your Pauillion for this night: For we haue wandred vp and downe this Countrie many a day, neyther seeing man to giue vs lodging, nor finding foode to cherish vs, which made vs wonder, that so braue a Countrey, and so beautified with natures ornaments as this is, should be left desolate of people, the cause whereof is strange, I know, and full of wonder. This question being courteously demaunded by Saint George , caused the Amazonian Queene as kindly to reply: Sir Knight quoth shee, (for so you seeme both by your behauiour, and gallant stature) what fauour my Pauillion may afford, be assured of: But the remembrance of my Countries desolation which you speake of, breedes a Sea of sorrow in my soule, and makes me sigh when I remember it: but because you are a Knight of a strange Land, I will report it, though vnto my greife: about some twelue yeares since, it was a Nigromancers chaunce to ariue within this Countrey, his name is Osmond , the cunningst Artist this day liuing vpon the earth, for he can at his call rayse all the spirits out of hell, and with his charmes make heauen to raine continuall showres of bloud: my beautie at that instance tempted him to loue, and drowned his senses so in desire, that hee assayed by all perswasions that eyther wit or Art coulde deuise, to winne mee to his will: but I hauing vowde myselfe to Dianaes chastitie, to liue in singlenesse among the Amazonian maydes, contemned his loue, despised his person, and accounted his perswasions as ominous as the hissing of venemous Snakes; for which hee wrought the destruction of this my Realme and Kingdome: for by his Magicke Art and damned charmes, hee raysed from the earth a mighty Tower, the morter whereof he mingled with virgins bloud, wherein are such Inchantments wrought, that the light of the Sunne, and the brightnesse of the skie is quenched, and the earth blasted with a terrible vapour, and blacke mist, that ascendeth from the Tower, whereby a generall darkenesse ouerspreads our land, the compasse of foure and twentie leagues, so that this Countrey is cleane wasted and destroyed, and my people fled out thereof. This tower is haunted day and night with gastly fiends, and at his departure into Persia, where he now by Inchauntment aides the Soldan in his warres against the Christians, hee left the garding of the same to a mightie and terrible Giant, in shape, the vgliest monster that euer eye beheld, or eare heard tell: For he is thirtie foote in length: his head three times larger then the head of an Oxe: his eyes bigger then two pewter dishes, and his teeth standing out of his mouth more then a foote, wherewith hee will breake both yron and steele: his armes, big and long without any measure, and all his body as blacke as any coale, and as hard as brasse: also of such a strength, that hee is able to carry away at once three Knights armed: and hee neuer eateth any other meate, but raw flesh of mankinde: he is so light and swift, that a horse cannot runne from him, and oftentimes hee hath beene assayed with great troupes of armed men, but all of them could neuer doe him any harme, neyther with sword, speare, Crosbow, nor any other weapon. Thus haue you heard, most noble and courteous Knight, the true discourse of my vtter ruine, and the vengeance shewed vppon my Countrey by this wicked Nigromancer: for which I haue remayned euer since in this Pauillion amongst my maides, where wee pray both day and night, that some vnhappie fortune, or terrible vengeance may fall vpon this wicked Coniurer. Now as I am true English Knight (replied S. George ) no sooner shall the mornings Sunne appeare, but I will take my iourney to that inchaunted Tower: into which Ile enter in despite of the Giant, and breake the Inchauntment, or make my graue within the Monsters bowels: which if I happily performe, then will I trauayle into Persia, and fetter vp the most wicked and damned Nigromancer, and like a Bloud hound lead him vp and downe the worlde in chaines. Most dangerous is the aduenture (quoth the Amazonian Queene) from whence as yet did neuer Knight returne. But if you bee so resolute and noble minded as to attempt the enterprise, then happie bee your fortune. And know braue Knight, that this Tower lieth westward, from hence some threescore miles: and thereupon shee tooke him by the hand, and caused Sabra likewise to alight from her Palfray and led them both into her Pauillion, where they were feasted most royally, and for that night slept securely. But when the dayes bright windowes opened, and the morning Sunne began to glister, in all the hast S. George that valiant minded Champion, arose from his sweete content, and armed himselfe: where after hee had taken his leaue of the Queene, and gaue her thankes for his courteous entertainment, hee also tooke his leaue of Sabra : whome he left in companie of the Queenes maydes, till his returne with conquest, and so rode forth till it was noone, and then he entred into a deepe Ualley, and euer hee rode lower and lower. It was then a faire day, and the Sunne shined cleare: but by that time he had ridden two miles and a halfe, he had lost both the light of the Sunne, and also the sight of heauen: for it was there as darke as night, and more dismall then the deepest dungeon. At last he found a mightie riuer with streames as blacke as pitch, and the bankes were so high, that the water could scarce be seene running vnderneath, and it was so full of Serpents, that none could enter amongst them that euer returned backe with life: About his head flew monstrous birds and diuers Griffins, who were able to beare away an armed Knight, horse and all, and were in as great multitudes, as though they had beene Starlings: Also there were flies as bigge as nuts, and as blacke as pitch, which stung him and his horse so grieuously, that their issued downe such store of bloud, that it chaunged his horse from a Sable to a Crimson colour: likewise the Griffins strooke at S. George with their talents so furiously, that had not hee defended himselfe with his shield, which couered his whole body, hee had beene pierced to the heart. In this dangerous maner rode he on, till he came to the gates of the Inchaunted Tower, whereas the Gyant sate in his yron coate vpon a blocke, with a Mace of steele in his hand, who at the first sight of S. George , beat his teeth so mightily together, that they rung like the strokes of an Anuile, and ran raging like a Fiend of hell, thinking to haue taken the Champions horse and all in his long teeth, that were as sharpe as steele, and to haue borne them presently into the Tower. But when Saint George perceiued his mouth open, he tooke his sword and thrust therein so far that it made the Gyant to roare so lowd, that the Elements seemed to thunder, and the earth to tremble, his mouth smoakt like a fierie Furnace, and his eyes rowled in his head like brands of flaming fire: the wound was so great, & the bloud issued so fast from the Gyants mouth, that his courage began to quaile, and against his will, hee was forced to yeeld to the Champions mercy, and to beg for life, to which Saint George agreed, but vpon condition, that the Gyant would discouer all the secrets of the Tower, and euer after bee sworne his true seruant, and to attend on him with all diligence, To which the Gyant swore by his owne soule, neuer to leaue him in extremitie, and to answere him truely to all questions whatsoeuer. Then S. George demaunded the cause of the darkenesse, and how it might be ceased. To which the Gyant answered in this maner: There was within this Countrie about some twelue yeares since, a cunning Nigromancer, that by Inchauntment built this Tower, the which you now beholde, and therein caused a terrible fire to spring from the earth, that cast such a smoake ouer the whole land: whereby the people that were wont to dwell therein, are fled and famished for hunger: Also this Inchaunter by his Art made the Riuer that you haue passed, the which did neuer man before this time without death: Also within the Tower neere vnto the fire, there stands a faire and pleasant fountaine, to which if euer any Knight be able to attaine, and cast the water thereof into the fire, then shall the darkenesse euer after cease, and the Inchauntment end: for which cause I haue beene bound to gard and keepe the Tower from the atcheiuement of any knight. Thus when the Gyant had ended his discourse, Saint George commaunded him to remaine at the gate, for hee would aduenture to end the Inchauntment, and deliuer the Countrie from so grieuous a plague. Then went hee close by the windowes of the Tower, the which were sixteene speares in length and breadth, till he came to a little wicket, through which hee must needes enter: yet was it set as thicke with pikes of steele, as the prickes of an Urchens skinne, to the intent that no Knight should approach neere vnto the doore, nor once attempt to enter the Tower: yet with great danger hee opened the wicket, whereout came such aboundance of smoake, that the darkenesse of the Countrie doubled, so that neither Torch nor Candle would burne in any place: yet neuertheles S. George entred, and went downewards vpon staires, where hee could see nothing, but yet felt so many great blowes vpon his Burgonet, that he was constrained to kneele vpon his knees, and with his shield to defend himselfe, or else he had beene brused to peeces. At last he came to the bottome, and there he found a faire great vawt, where he felt so terrible a heat, that hee sweat exceedingly, and as he felt about him, he perceyued yt he approched neere the fire, & going a little further, hee espied out the fountaine, whereat hee greatly reioyced: and so hee tooke his shield, and bore therein as much water as hee could, & cast it into the fire. In conclusion, labouring so long till the fire was cleane quenched: Then began the skies to receiue their perfect lightnes, and the golden Sun to shine most clearely about him, whereby hee plainely perceyued how there stoode vpon the staires, many great Images of brasse, holding in their hands mightie Maces of steele, the which had done him much trouble at his comming downe: but then their power was ended, the fire quenched, and the inchauntment finished. Thus when S. George through his inuincible fortitude had performed this dangerous aduenture, he grew weerie of trauell, what with heate and sweating, and the mighty blowes hee receiued from the brazen Images, that hee returned againe to the wicket, whereas the deformed Gyant still remained: who when he beheld the Champion returne both safe and sound, hee fell vpon his knees before him, and said. Sir Knight, you are most welcome and happily returned, for you are the flower of Chiualrie, and the brauest Champion in the world. Commaund my seruice, dutie, and obedience; for whilest I liue, I doe protest by the burning bankes of Acharon , neuer to follow any Knight but you; and thereupon I kisse your golden spurre, which is the noble badge of Knighthood. This humble submission of the Gyant caused the Champion to reioyce, not for his ouerthrow, but that he had gotten so mightie a seruant. Then vnlaced he his helmet, and lay downe after his wearie encounter; where, after hee had sufficiently rested himselfe, he tooke his iournie in company of the Gyant, to the Amazonian Queene, where he left his Lady in company of her virgins; who like a kind, modest, and vertuous wife, during all the time of her husbands absence, continually prayed to the immortall powers of heauen, for his fortunate successe, & happy returne: otherwise, resoluing her selfe, if the lowring destinies should crosse his intent, & vnluckily end his dayes before the aduenture were accomplished, then to spend the remnant of her life amongst those happy virgins. But on the sudden, before the Queene and her virgins were aware, S. George ariued before the Pauilion, dutifully attended on by the Gyant, who bore vpon his shoulder, the body of a tall Oake, by which ye Queene knew yt his prowesse had redeemed her countrey from darknes, & deliuered her from her sorrow, care, and trouble: so in copanie of her maids very gorgeously attyred, she coducted ye Champion to a bowre of Roses, intermingled with creeping vines, the which in his absence they had planted for his Ladies delight. There found he Sabra at her diuine praiers, like a solitary widdow, clad in mourning habilliments: but when shee beheld her Lord returne in safety, shee banished greife, and in all hast ran vnto him, & in his bosome rauished her selfe with pleasure. But to speake how the Amazonian Queene feasted them, and in what maner shee and her maids deuised pastimes for their contents, were too tedious to repeate: but when night gaue end to their pleasures, and sleepe summoned all things to a quiet silence, the Queene brought them to a very sumptuous lodging, wherein stood a bed framed with Ebon wood, ouer-hung with many pendants of gold, the Tike was stuft with downe of Turtle-Doues, the sheetes of Median silke: thereon lay a rich quilt wrought with cotten, couered with damaske, and stitcht with threds of gold. The Queene bestowed vpon S, George at his going to bed, an imbrothered shirt, curiously wrought with many rare deuices as the labours of Hercules , the triumphs of Mars , and the loues of many Potentates, wrought in such curious manner, as though Arte her selfe had beene the contriuer. Sabra , at her going to bed was likewise presented by the Queenes maydens, with a light Kirtle of changeable violet, somewhat blushing on a red colour. Also, they put a white Kercheife of silke vpon her head, somewhat loose and vntied, so that vnder the same her Iuory throte might be easily seene, and her fayre golden hayre flying about her necke: ouer them was cast a mantle of greene silke, which made the bed seeme more beautifull then Floraes richest ornament. By them the Queene and her Uirgins sate, making sweete musicke vpon their siluer tuned Lutes, till golden sleepe had closed vp their eyes: the which being done, the Queene with her Ladyes departed likewise to their naturall rests. But all this while the Gyant neuer entred the Pauillion, but slept as soundly vnder the roote of a Pine tree, as S, George did in his imbrothered bed: for he knew not what pleasures belonged thereunto, nor neuer before that time beheld any womans face. At last the night withdrew her blacke curtaines, and gaue the morning leaue to appeare, whose fearefull light caused S. George to forsake his bed, and to walke some fewe miles to ouer-veiw the country: In which iournie he tooke such exceeding pleasure, that he thought it the goodliest Realm that euer hee saw; for he perceiued well how that it was full of worldly wealth. At last hee climed vp to the toppe of a high mountayne, being some two miles from the Queenes Pauillion, whereon hee stood and beheld many stately Townes and Towers, high and mightie Castles, many large woods and meddowes, and many pleasant riuers, and about the townes, faire vines, goodly pastures and fields. At last he behelde the Citie of Argenia shining against the Sun, the place where the Queene in former time was wont to keepe her Court: which Cittie was inuironed with deepe ditches, the wals strongly builded, and more then fiue hundred Towers made of lime and stone: also hee saw many faire Churches couered with lead, hauing tops and spires of gold, shining most gorgeously, with weather-Cockes of siluer, glistring against the Sunne. Also he saw the Burgesses houses stand like palaces, closed with high and strong walles, barred with chaines of yron from house to house: whereat in his heart he praysed much the noblenes and richnes of the Citie, and sayd to himselfe, that it might well be called Argenia, for it seemed to be of Argent , that is as much to say, of siluer. During the time of the Champions pleasurable walke, which continued from the breake of day, to the closing of the euening, behapned a wofull Tragedie, neere vnto the Queenes Pauilion, committed by the monstrous Gyant whome S. George brought from the inchaunted tower: for that same morning when the Sun had mounted some fewe degrees into the firmament, seuen of the Queenes virgins in Sabraes company, walked into a pleasant thicket of trees adioyning to her Pauilion, not onely to take the pleasure of the mornings ayre, but to heare the chirping melodie of birds: in which thicket or groue, vnder a Pine tree, this Gyant lodged the passed night: for no sooner came these beautifull Ladies vnder the branches of the trees, but the Gyant cast his eye vppon them, whose rare perfections so fired the heart of the lustfull Gyant, that hee must eyther quench his desires with the spoyle of their chastities, or end his dayes in some monstrous maner: therefore, hee starts vp from the place where he lay, and with a wrathfull countenance ran amongst the Ladies, and catching them all eyght at once betwixt his armes, hee bore them to the furthest side of the groue, where he rauished seuen of the Queenes Maydens, & afterward deuoured them aliue into his lothesome bowels, Sabra beeing the eyght of that wofull number, which in her sight shee behelde butchered by that bloudie wolfe: but continuing the time of their rauishments, shee made her supplication to the gods; that they would in mercy defend her chastitie from the lustfull rape of so wicked a monster: & immediately vpon these words, she saw an vgly toade come crawling before her: through which by pollicie shee saued her life, and preserued her honour: for shee tooke the toade betwixt her hands, and crushed the venome from her impoysoned bowels, wherewith shee all to be sprinkled her face; so that presently her fayre beautie was changed into loathsome blisters; for she then seemed more liker a creature deformed with leprosie, then a Lady of excellent feature. At length, she being the last of all, her time came that she should be defloured, and the lustfull Giant came to fetch her: but when hee beheld her visage so inuenomed, her lothed her sight, seeking neyther to rauish her, nor proffering to deuoure her, but discontentedly wandred away, greatly greiuing at the committed crime, and sorely repenting himselfe of so wicked a deede, not onely for the spoyle of the seuen Uirgins, but for the wrongs proffered to so noble a Knight: who not onely graunted him libertie of life, but receyued him into his seruice: therefore he raged vp and downe the groue, making the earth to tremble at his exclamations: one while cursing his fortune and houre of creation: another while banning his sire and deuilish dam: but when he remembred the noble Champion S. George , whose angry frowne hee would not see for all the world, then to preuent the same, hee runne his head most furiously against a knobbed Oake and brayned himselfe: where wee will leaue him now weltring in his bloud, and speake what became of Sabra after this bloudie accident: for after she had wandred vp and downe the thicket many a wearie step, incensing heauen against the Giants crueltie, the Sun began to set, and the darke night drew on, which caused her thus to complayne: O you immortall powers of heauen, and you celestiall Plannets, being the true guiders of the firmaments, open your bright celestiall gates, and send some fatall Plannet, or some burning thunder-bolt, to rid mee from the vale of misery, for I will neuer more returne to my beloued Lord, sith I am thus deformed, and made an vgly creature, my lothesome face will proue a corasiue to his heart, and my bodie a torment to his soule: my sight will bee displeasant, my company hated, my presence loathed, and euery one will shun my sight as from Crocodiles: therefore I will remaine within this groue, till the heauens either bring me to my former beautie, or end my languishing misery: yet witnesse heauen of my loyalty vnto my Lord, and in what extremitie I haue maintayned my chastitie: in remembrance of my true loue, here will I leaue this chaine of gold for my beloued Lord to finde, that hee may knowe, for his sake I haue endured a world of woe. At which speaches shee tooke her chaine (which was doubled twentie times about her necke) and left it lying all besmeard in the bloud of those virgins whom the Gyant had rauished and slaine, and so betooke herselfe to a sad and solitary life, intending neuer to come in the sight of men, but to spend her dayes wandring in the woods: where wee will likewise leaue her for a time, & speake of Saint George , who by this was returned to the Queenes Pauillion, where hee missed his Ladie, and had intelligence, how that she in companie of seuen other Ladies, walked in the morning into a pleasant groue, to heare the melodie of byrds, and since that time no newes hath beene heard of them: for as then it grew towards night, which caused S. George greatly to mistrust that some mischance had befallen his Lady. Then hee demaunded what was become of the Giant: but answere was made, that he was neyther seene nor heard of since morning: which caused him greatly to suspect the Giants treacherie, & how by his meanes the Ladies were preuented of their purposed pleasures. Therefore in all hast like a franticke man, he ran into the thicket, filling euery corner with clamors and resounding ecchoes of her name, and calling for Sabra through euery bramble bush: but there he coulde neyther heare the voyce of Sabra : nor the answere of any other Lady, but the wofull eccho of his exclamations, which ratled through the leaues of trees. Then began he to waxe something melancholy, and passionate, wearing the time away with woful lamentations till bright Cinthia mounted on the Hemispheeres, by whose glistring beames he saw the ground besprinkled with purple gore, & found the chaine that Sabra was wont to weare about her necke, all besmeard in bloud: he bitterly complained against his owne fortune, & his Ladies haplesse destiny; for he supposed then that the Gyant had murthered her. O discontented sight (sayd hee) here lies the bloud of my beloued Lady, the truest woman that euer Knight inioyed: that body which for excellence deserued a monument of gold, more rich then the toombe of Angelica , I feare lies buried in the bowels of that monstrous Gyant, whose life vnhappily I graunted. Here is the chaine besmeared with bloud which at our first acquaintance I gaue her in a Courtly maske. This golden chaine, I say, stained with the bloud of my deare Lady, shall for euermore be kept within my bosome neere vnto my bleeding heart, that I may still remember her true loue, fayth and constancie. But fond foole that I am, why do I talke in vaine? it will not recompence her murthered soule, the which me thinks I heare how it cals for reuenge in euery corner of this groue. It was I that left her carelesly within the danger of the Gyant, whome I little mistrusted: therefore will I meete her in the Elizian shades, and craue remisson for my committed trespasse, for on this Oake I will abbridge my life, as did the worthy Knight Melmeropolion for ye loue of his Lady Sillera : which lamentation being no sooner ended, but he tooke the chayne of gold, and fastened one end to the arme of a great Oake, and the other end to his owne necke, intending presently to strangle himselfe: but heauen preuented his desperate intent after a strange maner: for vnder the same tree the brained Gyant lay not yet fully dead, who in this maner spake to S. George . O stay thy hand, most noble and inuincible Knight, the worlds cheife wonder for admired Chiualry, and let my dying soule conuert thee from so wicked a deed. Seuen virgins in this thicket haue I rauished, and buried all their bodies in my accursed bowelles: but before I could deflowre the eyght, in a strange maner her bright beautie was conuerted into a lothsome leprosie, whereby I detested her sight, and left her chastitie vndefiled: but by her sad complaints I since haue vnderstood, how that she is your Lady and loue, and to this houre she hath her residence within the circuit of this thicket: and thereupon with a dolefull grone which seemed to shake the ground, he bad adue to the world. Then S. George being glad to heare such tidings, reuerted from his desperate intent, and searching vp and downe the groue till he found Sabra , where shee sate sorrowing vnder the branches of a mulberie tree, betwixt whome was a sad and heauie greeting, & as they walked backe to the Queenes Pauilion, shee discoursed to him the truth of this bloudy stratagem; where she remained, till the Amazonian Queene had cured her leprosie by the secret vertue of her skill: of whome after they had taken leaue, and giuen her thankes for her kind curtesies, S. George with his Lady tooke their iourny towards Persia, where the Christian armies lay incampt: at whose ariuall, you shall heare strange and wonderfull things, the like was neuer done in any age. How Saint George and his Lady lost themselues in a wildernesse, where she was deliuered of three goodly boyes, The Fayrie Queenes Prophecie vpon the childrens fortunes. Of S. Georges returne into Bohemia, where he christened his children, & of the finding of his fathers graue, ouer which he built a stately toombe. Saint George hauing atcheiued the aduenture of the inchaunted Tower, and Sabra , the furie of the lustfull Gyant, they tooke their iournie towards Persia, where the Christian Champions lay incamped before the Souldans great Cittie of Graund Belgor, a place most strangely fortified with spirits and other gastly illusions by the Inchauntment of Osmond , whome you heard before in the last Chapter, to be the rarest Nigromancer in the world: But as the English Champion with his Lady trauailed thitherward, they hapned into a Desart, and mightie wildernesse, ouergrown with loftie Pines and Cedar trees, and many huge and mightie Oakes, the spreading branches whereof, seemed to with-hold the light of heauen from their vntroden passages, and the tops for exceeding height to reach into ye Elements: the inhabitants were Siluanes, Satires, Fayries, and other woodie Nimphes, which by day sported vp and downe the Forrest, and by night tended the pleasure of Proserpine the Fayrie Queene. The musicke of siluer sounding birds, fo chearefully resounding through the woods, and the whistling wind made such melodie amongst the leaues of trees, that it rauished their sences like the harmonie of Angels, and made them thimke they had entred the shades of gladsom Elizium: one while they wondred at the beautie of the woods, which nature had ornified with a Summers liuery: another while at the greene and fragrant grasse, drawne out in round circles by the Fayries daunces: so long till they had lost themselues amongst the vnknowne passages, not knowing how nor by what meanes to recouer the perfect path of their intended iournie, but were constrained to wander in the Wildernesse like solitarie Pilgrims, spending the day with wearie steps, and the night with vaine imaginations, euen as a child when he hath lost himselfe in a populous Citie, runneth vp and downe, not knowing how to returne to his natiue dwelling: Euen so it hapned to these two lost and disconsolate trauailers: for when they had wandred many dayes one way, and finding no end to their foyles, they retired backward to the place of their first setting foorth: where they were wont to heare the noyse of people resound in Countrie villages, and to meete trauailers posting from place to place: but now they heard nothing but blustring of winds, ratling in the wood, making the brambles to whistle, and the trees to groane, and now and then to meete a speckled beast like to the rainebow, weltering from his Den to seeke his naturall sustenance. In their trauaile by night they were wont to heare the crowing Cock, recording glad tidings of the chearefull dayes approach, the naying of horses in pasture fields, and the barking of dogs in Farmers houses: but now they were affrighted with the roaring of Lyons, yelling of Caues, the croking of Toades in rootes of rotten trees, and the rufull sound of Prognies rauishment, recorded by the Nightingale. In this solitarie maner wearied they the rouling time away, till thrice three times the siluer Moone had renewed her borrowed light: by which time the burthen of Sabraes wombe began to grow painfull, and the fruite of her body to waxe ripe, the houre of her deliuery drew on, wherein shee required Lucinaes help, to make Saint George the father of a princely Sonne: time called for Midwiues to aide and bring her babe into the world, and to make her a happie mother: but before the painefull houre of her deliuerie approacht, Saint George had prouided her a bower of Uine braunches, which hee erected betwixt two pleasant Hils: where in stead of a princely Cabbinet, behung with Arras and rich Tapestrie, shee was constrained to suffice her selfe with a simple lodging, couered with Roses and other fragrant flowers: her bed hee made of greene Mosse and thistle Downe, beset curiously round about with Oliue braunches, and the sprigges of an Oringe tree, which made it seeme more beautifull then Floraes Pauilion, or Dianaes Mansion: but at the last, when shee felt the paines of her wombe grow intolerable, and the seed ready to be reaped, and how shee was in a wildernesse deuoyde of womens company, that should be ready to assist her in so secret a matter, she cast her selfe downe vpon her Mossie bed, and with a blushing countenance she discouered her mind in this order to Saint George : My most deare and louing Lord (quoth she) my true and onely companion at all times and seasons except at this houre, for it is the painefull houre of my deliuerie: therefore depart from out the hearing of my cryes, and commit my fortune to the pleasures of the heauens: for it is not conuenient for any mans eye to beholde the secretes of a woman in such a case: stay not, I say, deare Lord, to see the Infant now sprawling in my wombe, to be deliuered from the bed of his creation, forsake my presence for a time, and let me like the noble Queene of Fraunce, obtayne the fauour of some Fayrie to be my Midwife, that my babe may be as happily borne in this wildernesse, as was her valiant sonnes Valentine and Orson : the one of them was cherisht by a King, and the other by a Beare; yet both of them grew famous in their deedes: My paine is great, deare Lord, therefore depart my Cabbinet, and before bright Phoebus lodgeth in the West, I shall either be a happie mother, or a liuelesse body: thou a ioyfull Father, or a sorrowfull widdower. At which wordes Saint George sealed agreement with a kisse, and silently departed without any reply: but with a thousand sighes he bad her adue, and so tooke his way to the top of a mountaine, being in distance from his Ladies abyding a quarter of a mile: there kneeled he during the time of her trauayles, with his bare knees vpon the bowels of the earth, neuer ceasing prayers, but continually solliciting the Maiestie of God, to graunt his Ladie a speedie deliuerie: at whose diuine Orizons the heauens seemed to relent, and all the time of her paine, couered the world with a vale of darknesse: whole flights of Birds, with troupes of vntamed beastes came flocking round about the mountaine where he kneeled, and in their kindes assisted his celestiall contemplations: where I will leaue him for a time, and speake what hapned to Sabra in the middle of her paines and extremitie of her trauayles: for after Saint Georges departure, the furie of her greife so raged in her wombe, that it exceeded the bounds of reason, whereby her heart was constrayned to breathe so many scortching sighs, that they seemed to blast the leaues of trees, and to wither the flowers which beautified her Cabbinet: her burthened torments caused her star-bright eyes, like fountaines, to distill downe siluer drops, and all the rest of her bodie to tremble like a Castle in a terrible earthquake: so greiuous were her paines, and rufull were her cries, that she caused the mercilesse Tigers to relent, and vntamed Lyons, with other wild beasts, like silly Lambes to sit and bleate: her greiuous cryes & bitter moanes caused the heauens, as it were, to bleede their vapours downe, and the earth to weepe a spring of teares: both herbes and trees did seeme to droope, hard stonie rockes to sweate when shee complayned. At last her pitifull cries peirced downe to the lowest vaults of direfull Dis , where Proserpine sits crowned amongst her Fayries, and so preuayled, that in all hast shee ascended from her regiment, to worke this Ladyes safe deliuerie, and to make her mother of three goodly boyes: who no sooner ariued in Sabraes lodging, but shee practised the dutie of a Midwife, eased the burden of her wombe, and safely brought her babes into the world: At whose first sight the heauens beganne to smile, and the earth to reioyce, as a signe and token, that in time to come they would proue three of the noblest Knights in the world. This courteous deede of Proserpine being no sooner performed, but shee layd the three boyes in three most rich and sumptuous Cradles, the which shee caused her Fayries to fetch inuisibly from three of the richest Kings in the world, and therewithall mantles of silke, with other things therevnto belonging: Likewise shee caused a winged Satyre, to fetch from the furthest borders of India, a couering of dammaske Taffetie imbrodered with gold, the most richest ornament that euer mortall eye beheld: for thereon was wrought and liuely portrayed by the curious skill of Indian weauers, how God created heauen and earth, the wandring courses both of Sunne and Moone, and likewise how the golden Plannets dayly doe predominate: Also there is no Storie in any age remembred since the beginning of the world, but it was thereon most perfectly wrought: So excellent it was, that Art her selfe coulde neuer deuise a cunninger. With this rich and sumptuous ornament shee couered the Ladies child-bed: whereby it seemed to surpasse in brauerie the gorgious bed of Iuno Queene of heauen, when first shee entertained imperious Ioue . After this Proserpine layd vnder euery childs pillow a siluer Tablet, whereon was written in Letters of gold, their good and happy fortunes. Under the first were these verses charactered, who at that time lay frowning in his Cradle like the God of Warre. A Souldier bold, a man of wondrous might, A King likewise this royall babe shall die: Three golden Diadems in bloudie fight, By this braue Prince shall conquered be: The Towers of faire Ierusalem and Rome, Shall yeelde to him in happie time to come. Under the pillow of the second babe was charactered these verses following, who lay in his Cradle smiling like Cupid vpon the lap of Dido , whom Venus transformed to the likenesse of Askanius . This child shall likewise liue to be a King, Times wonder for deuice and Courtly sport: His Tiltes and Turnaments abroad shall ring, To euery coast where noble Knights resort: Queenes shall attend and humble at his feete, Thus loue and beautie shall together meete. Lastly, vnder the pillow of the third were these verses likewise charactered, who blushed in his Cradle like Pallas when shee stroue for the golden Apple with Venus and the Queene of heauen. The Muses darling for true sapience, In Princes Court this babe shall spend his dayes: Kings shall admire his learned eloquence, And write in brazen bookes his endlesse prayse: By Pallas gift he shall atcheiue a Crowne, Aduance his fame and lift him to renowne. Thus when the Fayrie Queene had ended her Prophesie vpon the children, and had left their golden Fortunes lying in their Cradles, shee vanished away, leauing the Ladie reioycing at her safe deliuerie, and wondred at the gifts of Proserpine : which shee coniectured to be but shadowes to dazle her eyes, and things of a vading substance: but when shee had layd her hands vppon the rich couering of Dammaske Taffetie, which couered her Mossie bed, and felt that it was the selfe same forme that it seemed, shee cast her eyes with a chearefull looke vp to the Maiestie of heauen, and not onely gaue thankes to immortall Ioue for her rich receiued benefites, but for his mercifull kindnesse in making her the happie mother of three such goodly children. But we will now returne againe to the noble Champion S. George , whome wee left praying vppon the Mountaine top: and as you hearde before, the skies were ouerspread with Sable clouds, as though they had beene mourning witnesses of his Ladies torments: but before the golden Sunne had diude into watrie Thetis lap, the Element began to cleare, and to withdraw her former mourning Mantles, by which hee supposed that heauen had pittied his Ladies paines, and granted her a safe deliuerie: therefore in all haste hee retyred backe to the Siluane Cabbinet, the which hee found most strangely deckt with sumptuous habilliments, his Ladie lying in her child-bed as glorious, as if shee had beene the greatest Empresse in the world, and three princely boyes sweetly sleeping in their seuerall Cradles: At whose first sight his heart was so rauished with ioy, that for a time it with-held the passage of his tongue: but at last when hee found the siluer Tablets lying vnder the pillowes, and had read the happie fortunes of his children, hee ranne vnto his Lady, imbraced her most louingly, and kindly demaunded the true discourse of that strange accident, and by whose meanes the bower was beautified so gorgeously, and the propounder of his childrens prophesie: who with a countenance blushing like the purple Morning, replied in this maner: My most deare and welbeloued Lord, the paines I haue indured to make you the happy father of three louely boyes, hath beene more terrible then the stroke of death: but yet my deliuery more ioyfull then the pleasures of Elizium: the winds carried my groanes to euery corner of this wildernesse, whereby both trees and herbs assisted my complaints, beasts, birds, and feathered foules, with euery sencelesse thing that nature framed on this earth, seemed to aggrauate my mones: but in ye middle of my torments, when my soule was ready to forsake this worldly habitation, there appeared to me a Queene crowned with a golden Diadem, in state and gesture, like imperious Iuno , and in beautie to diuine Diana : her garments for brauery seemed to staine ye Rainebow in her brightest hue, and for diuersitie in colours, to surpasse the Flowers in the fields: On her attended many beautifull Nimphes, some clad in garments in colour like the Marble Ocean, some in attire as gallant as the purple Rose, and some more glorious then the Azurde firmaments: her wisdome might compare with Apolloes , her iudgement with Pallas , and her skill with Lucinaes : for no sooner entred she my presence, but my trauailes ceased, & my wombe deliuered vp her grieuous burthen: my babes being brought to light by the vertue of her skill, she prepared these rich and sumptuous Cradles, the which were brought inuisible to my Cabbinet: likewise these Mantles and this imbrothered Couerlet, she frankely bestowed vpon me, and so immediatly vanished away. At which words, Saint George gaue her so many kind imbraces, and kissed her so louingly, as though it had bin the first day of their Nuptials. At last her hunger increased, and her desires thirsted so much after foode, that except she receiued some comfortable sustenance, her life were in danger. This extreme desire of Sabra , caused S. George to buckle on his Armour, and to vnsheath his trustie sword, ready to gorge the entrailes of some Deare: who swore by the honour of true Knighthood, neuer to rest in peace, till he had purchased his hearts content. My Loue (quoth he) I will aduenture for thy sake, more dangers, then Iason did for Medeas loue: Ile search the thickest Groues, and chase the nimble Doe to death: the flying Foule Ile follow vp and downe from tree to tree, till ouer-wearied they doe fall and die: For loue of thee and these my tender babes, whome I esteeme more deare then the Conquest of rich Babylon, I will aduenture more daungers, then did Hercules for the loue of Deianira , and more extremes then Turnus did in his bloudie battels: and thereupon with his Fauchion readie charged, hee traced the woods, leauing no thornie brake nor mossie Caue vnsearcht, till hee had found a heard of fallow Deere: from which number hee singled out the fattest, to make his Lady a bountifull banquet: but in the time of his absence, there hapned to Sabra a strange and wonderfull accident: for there came weltering into the Cabbinet three most wild and monstrous beasts, a Lyon, a Tiger, and a she Wolfe, which tooke the babes out of their Cradles, and bore them to their secret Caues. At which sight, Sabra like one distraught of sence, started from her bed, and to her weake power offered to follow the beasts, but all in vaine: for before shee could get without her Cabbinet, they were past sight, and the childrens cries without her hearing: then like a discontented woman shee turned backe, beating her breasts, rending her haire, and raging vp and downe her Cabbinet, vsing all the rigour shee could deuise against her selfe; and had not S. George returned the sooner, she had most violently committed her owne slaughter: but at his returne, when he beheld her face stained with teares, her head disrobed of ornaments, & her Iuorie breasts all to be rent and torne, he cast downe his venison, and in all haste asked the cause of her sorow. O (sayd shee) this is the wofullest day that euer hapt to me: for in the time of your vnhappy hunting, a Lionesse, a Tygresse, and a Wolfe came into the Cabbinet, and tooke my children from their cradles; what is become of them I know not, but greatly I feare, by this time they are intoombed within their hungry bowels. O simple monuments (quoth he) for such sweete babes! Well Sabra , if the monsters haue bereaued me of my children this bloudy sword that diu'd into the entrailes of fallow Deere, shall riue my wofull heart in twaine. Accursed be this fatall day, the Plannets that predominate, & Sun that shines thereon: heauen, blot it from the yeere, and let it neuermore bee numbred, but accounted for a dismall day through all the world: let all the trees be blasted in these accursed woods: let hearbes and grasse consume away and die, & all things perish in this wildernes. But why breathe I out these curses in vaine, when as me thinkes I heare my children in vntamed Lyons dens, crying for helpe and succour? I come, sweete babes, I come, either to redeeme you from the Tigers wrathfull iawes, or make my graue within their hungry bowels. Then tooke hee vp his sword besmeared all with bloud, and like a man bereau'd of wit and sence, raged vp and downe the wildernes, searching euery corner for his children, but his Lady remained still in her cabbinet, lamenting for their losse, washing their cradles with her pearled teares that trickled downe her stained cheekes like siluer drops. Many wayes wandred S. George : sometime in vallies where Wolues and Tigers lurke: sometime on mountayne toppes, where Lyons whelps do sport and play, and many tines, in dismall thickets, where Snakes and Serpents liue. Thus wandred S. George vp and downe the wildernes for the space of two dayes, hearing no newes of his vnchristened children. At last he approched the sight of a pleasant riuer, which smoothly glided downe betwixt two mountaines; into whose streames he purposed to cast himselfe, and so by a desperate death giue end to his sorrowes. But as hee was committing his body to the mercy of the waters, and his soule to the pleasure of the heauens, he heard a far off, the rufull scrike, as he thought, of a comfortlesse Babe: which sudden noyse caused him to refraine from his desperate purpose, & with more discretion tender his owne safety. Then casting his eye aside, it was his happy destiny to spie the three inhumane beastes lying at the foote of the hill, tumbling themselues against the warme Sun, & his three prettie Babes sucking from their wombes, their most vnkindly milke: which spectacle so encouraged ye Champion, that without further aduisement with his single sword he assailed at one time, the three monsters: but so furiously they pursued him, that he little preuailed; & being almost breathlesse, was forced to leape into an Oringe tree, else he had bin buried in their merciles bowels: but when the three wilde beastes perceyued him aboue their reaches, and that by no meanes they could come neere him, with their wrathfull iawes they so rent & tore the roote of the tree, that if by policy hee had not preuented them, the tree had bin puld in pieces: for at that time it was so full of ripe Oringes, and so ouerloden, that ye branches seemed to bend, & the boughes to breake: of which fruite he cast such abundance downe to the beastes, whereby they restrained their furies, and fed so fast thereon, that in short time they grew drunke, & quite ouercome with a dead and heauy sleepe. This good and happy fortune caused S. George nimbly to leape fro the tree, and with his keene edged sword deliuered their heads from their bodies, the which being done, he went to his children, lying comfortles vpon a mossy banke; who so pleasantly smiled in his face, that they made him greatly to reioyce, & to receiue as great pleasure in their sights, as though hee had beene honoured with the conquests of Caesar , or the royaltie of Alexander : therefore, after he had giuen them his blessing, he tooke the vp in his armes, and spake these words following: Come, come, my pretty babes, your safe deliueries from these in humane monsters, will adde long life vnto your mother, and hath preseru'd your Father from a desperate death. From henceforth let heauen be your guide, and send you as happy fortunes as Remus and Romulus , the first founders of imperious Rome, which in their infancies were nursed with the milke of a rauenous Wolfe: and as prosperous in your aduentures, as was that Persian Potentate, which fed vpon the milke of a Bitch. At the end of which speaches, he approched the Cabbinet, where he left his Lady mourning for the losse of her children: but at his returne he found her without sence or mouing, being not able to giue him a ioyful welcome: whereat he fell into this extreame passion of sorrow: O fortune, fortune (quoth he) how many greifes heapest thou vpon my head! wilt thou needes inioyne me to an endles sorrow? See, Sabra , see, I haue redeemed our sonnes, and freed them from the Tigers bloudie iawes, whose wrathfull countenance did threaten death. Which comfortable speaches caused her presently to reuiue, and to take the silly Infants in her armes, laying them sweetly vppon her iuory bosome: at which they seemed to smile as pleasantly, as Cupid in the lap of Dido , when Æneas sported in the Court of Carthage. The kind imbraces, louing speaches, and ioyfull conference that past betwixt the Champion and his Lady, were now too long to be discoursed: but to be short, they remayned in the wildernes without further disturbance, either of wilde beastes or other accident, till Sabra had recouered her child-bed sicknes: and then beeing conducted by a happy starre, they returned backe the ready way to Christendome: where after some fewe daies trauell, they ariued in the Bohemian Court, where the King of that Countrie, with two other bordering Princes, most royally christened his children. The eldest they named Guy : the second, Alexander : and the third, Dauid : the which being performed, and the Triumphes ended, which in most sumptuous manner continued for the space of one moneth, then the Bohemian King for the great loue he bare vnto Saint George , prouided most honourably for his childrens bringing vp. First, hee appoynted three seuerall Embassadours with all things necessarie for so princely a charge, to conduct the three Infants to three seuerall countries. The first and eldest whose fortune was to be a souldier, he sent to the imperial Citie of Rome, (being then the wonder of the world for Martial discipline) there by the Emperour to be trayned vp. The second, whose fortune was to be a Courtly Prince, he sent to the rich and plentifull country of England, being the pride of Christendome for all delightfull pleasures. The third and last, whose fortune was to proue a Scholler, hee sent into Germanie, to the University of Wittenberg, being thought at that time to be the excellentest place of learning, that remained throughout the whole world. Thus were S. Georges children prouided for by the Bohemian King: for when the Embassadours were in a readines the ships for their passage furnished, and their attendance appoynted, S. George in the companie of his Lady, the King of Bohemia with his Queene, and a traine of Lords, gentlemen, and Ladies conducted them to ship-boord, where the winde serued them so prosperously, that in a short time they bid adue to the shore, and sayled cheerefully away. But as S, George returned backe to the Bohemian Court, it was his chance to come by an old ruinated Monastery, vnder whose wals in former time his father was buried, the which hee knew by certaine verses that were carued in stone ouer his graue by the commons of the country (as you may read before in the beginning of this Historie.) Ouer the same, hee requested of the King, that he might erect a stately monument that the remembrance of his name might liue for euer, & not be buried in the graue of obscuritie. To which reasonable demaund, the King most willingly consented, and in haste gaue speciall commaundement, that the cunningest Architectors that remained within his Dominion, should forthwith be sent for, and withall gaue a tun of gold forth of his owne treasurie towards the performance thereof. The sudden report of this memorable deed being bruited abroade, caused workemen to come from euery place of their owne accord with such willingnes, that they in short time finished it. The foundation of the toombe was of the purest Marble, whereon was ingrauen the frame of the earth and how the watry Ocean was deuided, with woods, groues, hilles and dales, so liuely portrayed, that it was a wonder to behold: the props and Pinacles of Alablaster, beset with knobs of Iasper stone, the sides and Pillers, of the clearest Iet, vpon the top stood foure golden Lions, holding vp, as it were, an element, therein was curiously contriued the golden Sunne and Moone, and how the heauens haue vsuall courses, with many other excellent things wrought both in gold and siluer, which for this time I omit, because I am forced at large to discouer the princely proceedings of S. George who after the monument was finished, with his Ladie most humbly tooke their leaue of the King, thanked him for his loue kindnesse, and curtesie, and so departed towards Egypt and Persia, of whose aduentures you shall heare more in this Chapter following. How S. George with his Lady ariued in Egypt: of their royall entertainements to the Citie of Graund Cayer: And also how Sabra was crowned Queene of Egypt. Many strange accidents and dangerous aduentures, S. George with his Lady passed before they ariued within the territories of Egypt, that I want memory to relate the, and Arte to describe the. But at last when fortune smiled, which before had long time crossed their intents with her inconstant chances, and had cast them happily vpon the Egyptian shore, being the nurse and mother of Sabraes first creation. The twelue Peeres with whome S. George beforetime had committed the guiding of the Land, and keeping of his Crowne, as you heard before discoursed, now met him and his Lady at the Sea sids, most richly mounted vpon their costly trapped Steeds, and willingly surrendred vp his Scepter, Crowne, and Regiment: and after, in companie of many Princely Estates, both of Dukes, Earles, Lords, Knights, and royall Gentlemen, they attended them to the Citie of graund Cayer, beeing then vnder the subiection of the Egyptian Monarchy, and the greatest Cittie in the world: for it was in breadth and compasse full three score miles, and had by iust account within the walles twelue thousand Churches, besides Abbies, Priories, and houses of Religion: but when S. George with his stately attendants entred the gates, they were presently entertayned with such a ioyfull sound of Belles, Trumpets, and Drummes, that it seemed like the inspiring melodie of heauenly Angels, and to exceede the Royaltie of Caesar in Rome, when hee returned from the worlds conquest. The streetes were beautified with stately Pageants, contriued by schollers of ingenious capacitie, the pauements strowed with all maner of odoriferous flowres, and the walles hung with Indian Couerlets and curious Tapestrie. Thus passed they the streetes in great solemnitie, wondring at the curiositie of the Pageants, and listning to their learned Orations, till they entred the gates of the Palace; where, in the first entry of the Court was contriued ouer their heads, a golden pendant firmament, as it were supported by a hundred Angels: from thence it seemed to rayne Nectar and Ambrosia : Likewise there descended, as it were from the clouds, Ceres , the goddesse of plentie, sitting vpon a throne of gold, beautified with all maner of springing things, as of Corne, Oliues, Grapes, Hearbs, Flowers, and Trees: who, at the comming by of S. George and his Ladie, presented them with two garlands of wheate, bound vp most curiously in bands of siluer, to signifie that they were happily returned to a plentifull countrey, both of wealth and treasure. But at Ceres ascension vp into the firmament, there was seene most strange and pleasant fireworkes, shooting from place to place, as though the fierie Planets had descended heauen, and had generally consented to make them delightfull pastimes: But as Saint George with his Lady crowned with Garlands of Wheat, passed through the second Court, they beheld a Pageant most strangely contriued: wherein stoode Mars the angrie God of warre, inuironed with a Campe of armed Souldiers, as if they were with their weapons readie charged to assault some strong Hold, or inuincible Cittie: their siluer Trumpets seemed to sound cheerefully, their thundring Drums couragiously, their silken streamers to flourish valiantly, and themselues to match triumphantly. All which seemed to bee of more content to Saint George , then all the delightfull pleasures before rehearsed: for there was nothing in all the world that more reioyced his heart, then to heare the pleasant sound of warres, and to see Souldiers brandish forth their steeled weapons. After hee had sufficiently delighted himselfe in these Martiall sportes, and was ready to depart, the god of warre descended his throne, and presented him with the richest Armour that euer eye beheld, and the brauest sword that euer Knight handled: for they had beene kept within the Cittie of Graund Cayer for the space of fiue hundred yeeres, and held for the richest monuments in the Countrie. Also he presented Sabra with a myrrour of such an inestimable price, that it was valued at a Kings Dominion: for it was made by Magicke Art: the vertues and qualities thereof were so pretious, that it is almost incredible to report: for therein one might beholde the secret misteries of all the liberall Sciences, and by arte discouer what was practised in other Princes Courts: if any hill or mountaine within a thousand miles of the place where it remained, were inriched with a mine of gold, it would describe the place and countrey, and how deepe it lay closed in the earth: by it one might truly calculate vpon the birth of children, succession of Princes, and continuance of common-weales, with many other excellent gifts of vertues, which for this time I omit. Then in great state passed S. George to the third Court, which was as richly beautified with as gallant sights as the other twane: for there was most liuely portraied ye maner of Elizium, how Ioue & Iuno sate inuested on their royall thrones, and likewise how all the gods & goddesses tooke their places by degrees in Parliament: the sight was pleasant, & the deuice most excellent, their musicke admired, and their songs most heauenly. Thus passed S. George with his Lady through the three Courts, till they came to the Pallace: wherein was prouided against their comming, a statelier banquet then had the Macedonian Monarch, at his returne to Babylon, when he had conquered the middle earth: the curious cates and well appoynted dishes were so many, that I want Art or eloquence to describe them: but to be short, it was the sumptuoust banquet that euer they beheld, since their departure from the English Court, and so artificially serued, as though that all the Kings of the world had beene present. Many daies continued this sumptuous cheare, and concluded with such princely triumphes, as Arte her selfe wants memorie to describe. The Coronatio of Sabra , which was royally performed within three moneths following, requires a golden pen to write it, and a tongue washt in the conseruatiues of ye Muses hony to declare it. Egypt was honoured with triumphs, and Graund Cayer with tilts and turnaments. Through euery towne was proclaimed a solemne and feastiuall day, in ye remembrance of their new crowned Queene: no tradesman nor Artificer was suffred to worke vpon that day, but were charged vpo paine of death to hold it for a day of tryumphs, a day of ioy, & a day of pleasure: in which royalties, S. George was a principall performer, till thirst of honour summoned him to Armes: the remebrance of the Christian Champions in Persia, caused him to breuiat the pastimes, & to buckle on his steeled Corslet, which had not glistered in the fields of Mars in foure and twenty months: of whose noble deeds, and aduenturous proceedings, I will at large discourse, and leaue all other pastimes, to the new inuested Queene and her Ladies. The bloudie battell betwixt the Christians and the persians, and how the Nigromancer Osmond raysed vp by Magicke Arte, an Armie of spirits to fight agrinst the Christians: How the sixe Champions were inchaunted, and recouered by Saint George: The miserie and death of the Coniurer: and how the Souldan brained him selfe against a Marble piller. Now must we returne to the Christian Champions, and speake of their battels in Persia, and what happened to them in S. Georges absence: for if you remember before, being in Egypt, when he had newes of his Ladies condemnation in England, for the murther of the Earle of Couentrie, he caused them to march into Persia, and incouraged them to reuenge his wrongfull imprisonment vpon the Souldan and his Prouinces: into which Countrey after they had marched some fiftie miles, burning and spoyling his Territoryes, they were intercepted by the Souldanes power which was about the number of three hundred thousand fighting men: but the mustrer-rolles of the Christians were likewise numbred, and they surmounted not to aboue one hundred thousand able men: at which time, betwixt the Christians and Pagans happened a long and dangerous battell, the like in any age was seldome fought: for it continued without ceasing, for the space of fiue dayes, to the great effusion of bloud on both parties. But at last the Pagans had the worst: for when they beheld their fields bestrowed with mangled bodies, and that the riuers for twentie miles compasse did flow with Crimson bloud, their hearts began to faile, and incontinently fled like sheepe before the wolfe. Then the valiant Christians thirsting after reueng, speedily pursued them, sparing neither young nor old, till the waies were strowed with liueles bodies, like heapes of scattered sand: In which pursuite and honourable Conquest, they burned two hundred Forts and townes, battering their Towers of stone as leuell with the ground, as haruest reapers doe fields of ripened corne: But the Souldan himselfe, with many of his best approoued souldiers escaped aliue, & fortified the Cittie of Graund Belgor, being the strongest Towne of warre in all the Kingdome of Persia: before whose walles wee will leaue the Christian Champions planting their puissant forces, and speake of the damnable practises of Osmond within the towne, where he accomplisht many admirable accidents by Magicke Art: for when the Christian Armie had long time giuen assault to the walles, sending their fiery bullets to their loftie battlemets like storms of winters haile, whereby the Persian souldiers were not able any longer to resist, they began to yeeld & commit their liues to the mercies of the Christian Champions: but whe ye Souldan perceiued his souldiers cowardice, and how they would willingly resigne his happie gouernement to forraine rule, hee incouraged them still to resist the Christians desperate encounters, and within thirtie dayes, if they had not the honour of the war, then willingly to condiscend to their Countries conquest: which princely resolution incouraged the souldiers to resist, intending neuer to yeeld vp their Cittie, till death had made triumph in their bodies. Then departed he into a secret Tower, where he found Osmond sitting in his Chaire, studying by Magicke, how long Persia should remaine vnconquered: who at his entrance droue him from his charmes with these speeches: Thou wondrous man of Art (sayd the Souldan) whom for Nigromancie the world hath made famous. Now is the time to expresse the loyaltie and loue thou bearest thy Soueraigne: Now is the time thy Charming Spels must worke for Persiaes good: thou seest my fortunes are deprest, my souldiers dead, my Captaines slaughtered, my Cities burned, my fields of Corne consumed, and my Countrey almost conquered: I that was wont to couer the Seas with Fleetes of ships, now stand amazed to heare the Christians Drums, that sound foorth dolefull Funerals for my souldiers: I that was wont with armed Legions to drinke vp riuers as wee marched, and made the earth to groane with bearing the number of our multitudes: I that was wont to make whole kingdomes tremble at my frownes, and force imperious Potentates to humble at my feete: I that haue made the streetes of many a Cittie run with bloud, and stoode reioycing when I saw their buildings burne: I that haue made the mothers wombs the Infants toombes, and caused Cradles for to swimme in streames of bloud, may nowe behold my Countries ruine, my kingdomes fall, & mine owne fatall ouerthrow: Awake, great Osmond , from thy dreaming traunce, awake, I say, and raise a troupe of blacke infernall fiendes to fight against the damned Christians, that like to swarmes of Bees doe flocke about our wals: preuent, I say my lands inuasion, and as I am great Monarch of Asia, Ile make thee King ouer twentie Prouinces, & Sole Commaunder of the Ocean: rayse vp, I say, thy charmed spirits: leaue burning Acharon emptie for a time, to ayd vs in this bloudie battell. These words being no sooner ended, but there ratled such a peale of Cannons against the Cttie wals, that they made the verie earth to shake: whereat the Nigromancer started from his Chaire, and in this maner incouraged the Souldan: It is not Europe (quoth hee) nor all their pettie bands of armed Knights, nor all the Princes in the world, that shall abate your princely dignitie: Am not I the great Magician of this age, that can both lose and bind the fiends, and call the blacke-faste Furies from low Cossitus ? Am not I that skilfull Artist, which framed the charmed Tower amongst the Amazonian Dames, which all the Witches in the world could neuer spoyle? Therefore let Learning, Arte, and all the secrets of the deepes, assist mee in this enterprize, and then let frowning Europe doe her worst: my charmes shall cause the heauens to rayne such ratling showers of stones vpon their heads, whereby the earth shall be ouerloaden with their dead bodies, and hell ouerfilled with their hatefull soules: sencelesse trees shall rise in humane shapes, and fight for Persia. If wise Medea were euer famous for Arts, that did the like for safegard of her fathers state: then why should not Osmond practise wonders for his Soueraignes happines? Ile raise a troupe of spirits from the lowest earth, more blacke then dismall night, the which in vgly shapes shall haunt them vp and downe, and when they sleeps within their rich Pauillions, legions of fierie spirits will I vprayse from hell, that like to Dragons spitting flames of fire, shall blast and burne the damned Christians in their Tents of warre: The fields of Graund Belgor shall be ouerspred with venemous Snakes, Adders, Serpents, and impoysoned Toades, the which vnseene shall lurke in Mossie ground, and sting the Corronets of warlike horses: downe from the Chrystall firmament, I will coniure a troupe of ayrie spirits to descend, that like to virgins clad in princely ornaments, shall linke these Christian Champions in the chaines of loue: their eyes, which shall be like the twinkling Lamps of heauen, shall dazell so their warlike thoughts, and their louely countenance more bright then Angels, shall leade them captiues to a Tent of loue, the which shall be artificially erected vp by my Magicke Spels: their warlike weapons that were wont to sweate in Pagans bloud, shall in my charmed Tent bee hung vpon the bowers of peace: their glistring Armours that were wont to shine within the fields of Affrica, shall henceforth be euermore stayned with rust, and themselues surnamed for Martiall discipline, the wondrous Champions of the world, shall surfet with delightfull loues, and sleepe vpon the laps of ayrie spirits, that shall descend the Elements in virgins shapes, terrour and despaire shall mightily oppresse their mercilesse Souldiers, that they shall yeeld the honorable conquest to your excellencie: such strange and wondrous accidents by Art shall bee accomplished, that heauen shall frowne at my Inchauntments and the earth tremble to heare my Coniurations. Therefore most mightie Persian, number vp thy scattered bands, and to morrow in the morning set open thy gates, & march thitherward with thy armed souldiers: leaue not a man within the Citie, but let euery one that is able to carrie Armes, fight in the honour of Persia and before the closing of the night, Ile make thee Conquerour, and yeelde vp the brauing Christians as prysoners to thy mightinesse. If this proue true, renowmed Osmond , as thou hast promised (sayd the Souldan) earth shall not harbour that too deare for thee: for thou shalt haue my selfe, my kingdomes, Crownes and Scepters at commaund: the wealthie Riuer Ganges , shall pay thee yearely tribute with her treasure: Pactulus shall yeelde his ritches to thy pleasure, the place where Midas washt his golden wish away. All things that nature framed precious, shalt thou be Lord and Sole commaunder of, if thou preuent the inuasion of my Countrey: and thereupon he departed the Chamber, and left the Nigromancer in his studie: and as hee gaue commaundement his Captaines made in readinesse their souldiers, and furnished their warlike horses, and by the Sunnes vprising, marched into the fields of Belgor : where vpon the Northside of the enemie they pitched their Campe. On the other side, when the warlike Christians had intelligence by their Courts of gard, howe the Pagans were entred the fieldes, readie to giue them battell, sudden Alarums sounded in their eares, rumors of conquest encouraged so their Souldiers, that presently they were in readinesse to entertayne the Persians to a bloudy banquet. Both armies were in sight, with bloud red colours wauering in the ayre: the Christian Champions richly mounted on their warlike coursers, placed themselues in the forefront of the battell like couragious Captaines, fearing neyther death, nor the vnconstant chance of fortune. But the Souldan with his petty Princes like cowards, were inuiron'd and compast with a ring of armed Knights, where in stead of nimble Steedes, they sate in iron charriots. Diuers heroicall and many princely incouragements past betweene the two Armies, before they entred battell: but when the Drums began to sound alarum, and the siluer Trumpets gaue dreadfull ecchoes of death: when the Crosse of Christendome began to flourish, and the Armes of Mahomet to aduance; euen then began so terrible and bloudie a battell, that the like was neuer found in any age: for before the Sunne had mounted to the top of heauen, the Pagans receiued so greate a massaker, and fell so fast before the Christian Champions, that they were forst to wade vp to the knees in bloud, and their souldiers to fight vpon heaps of slaughtered men: the fields were conuerted from a greene colour to a purple hewe, the dales were steept in crimson gore, and the hils and mountaines hung with dead mens ratling bones. But let vs not forget the wicked Nigromancer Osmond , that during the time of that dangerous encounter kneeled in a low valley neere vnto the campes, with his blacke haire hanging downe vnto his shoulders like a wreathe of snakes, and with his siluer wand circling the earth; where when hee heard the sound of Drums thundring in the ayre, and the brazen Trumpets giuing dreadfull sounds of warre, hee entred into these fatall and damned speaches: Now is the battell (quoth he) furiously begunne, for me thinks I heare the Souldan cry for helpe: nowe is the time my charming spels must worke for Persiaes victorie, and Europes fatall ouerthrow: which being sayd, thrice did he kisse the earth, thrice behold the elements, and thrice besprinckled the circle with his owne bloud, the which with a siluer razor he let from his left arme, and after began againe to speake in this maner: Stand still, you wandring lamps of heauen, mooue not, sweete starres, but linger on, till Osmonds Charmes bee brought to full effect. O thou great Daemon , prince of damned ghosts, thou cheife comaunder of those fearefull shapes, that nightly glide by misbeleeuing trauellers, euen thou that holdest a snakie scepter in thy hand, sitting vpon a throne of burning steele, euen thee that bindest the furies vp in chaines, euen thee that tossest burning fire brands abroad, euen thee whose eyes are like two blazing and vnlucky Commets, euen thee I charge to let thy furies loose, open thy braze gates and leaue thy boyling cauldrons empty: send vp such Legions of infernall fiends, that may in number counteruayle the blades of grasse that beautifie these bloudy fieldes of Belgor. These fatall speeches being no sooner finished, but there appeared such a multitude of spirits, both from the earth, water, ayre, and fire, that it is almost incredible to report, the which hee caused to runne into the Christian Armie: whose burning Fauchions not onely annoyed the souldiers with feare and terror, but also fiered their horses manes, burned their trappings, consumed their banners, scorched trees and hearbes, and dimmed the elements with such an extreme darkenesse, as though the earth had beene couered with eternall night: he caused his spirits likewise to rayse such a terrible tempest, that it tore vp mighty Oakes by the rootes, remoued hilles and mountaines, and blew men into the ayre horse and all: yet neyther his Magicke Artes, nor all the Furies of his wicked spirits could any whit daunt the most noble and magnanimious mindes of the sixe Champions of Christendome: but like vnconquered Lyons they purchast honour where they went, colouring their swords in Pagans bloud, making the earth true witnes of their victorious and heroicall proceedings, whome they had attyred in a bloud red liuery: and though Saint George (the cheife Champion of Christendome for Martiall discipline, and princely atcheiuements) were absent in that terrible battell: yet merited they as much honor & renowne, as though he had beene there present: for the accursed Pagans fell before their warlike weapons, as thicke as leaues doe fall from the trees, when the blustring stormes of winter enter on the earth. But when the wicked Nigromancer Osmond perceiued, that his Magicke spels tooke small effect, and how in despite of his Inchauntments the Christians got the better of the day, he accursed his Art, and banned the houre and time wherein hee first attempted so euill and wicked an enterprise, thinking them to be preserued by Angels or else by some celestiall meanes: but yet not purposing to leaue off at the first repulse, he attempted another way by Nigromancie to ouerthrowe the Christians. First he erected vp by Magicke Art a stately Tent, outwardly in show like to the compasse of the earth: but furnished inwardly with all the delightfull pleasures that eyther Art or reason could inuent, onely framed to inchaunt the Christian Champions with intising delights, whome he purposed to keepe as prisoners therein: then fell hee againe to his coniuration, and bound a hundred spirits by due obedience to transforme themselues into the likenes of beautifull virgins, which in a moment they accomplished, and they were framed in forme and beautie like to the darlings of Venus , in comelinesse comparable with Thetis dauncing on the siluer sands, & in all proportions like Daphne , whose beautie caused Apollo to descend the heauens: their limmes were like the loftie Cedars: their cheekes to Roses dipt in milke, and their eyes more bright then the starres of heauen: also they seemed to carrie in their hands siluer bowes, and on their backes hung quiuers of golden Arrowes: Likewise vpon their brests they had pictured ye God of loue, dauncing vpon Mars his knee. Thus in the shape of beautious Damsels, caused he these spirits to enter the Christian Armie, and with the golden baite of their intising smiles, to tangle the Champions in the snares of loue, & with their smiling beauties lead them from their souldiers, and to bring them prisoners into his inchaunted tent. Which commaundement being no sooner giuen, but these virgins, or rather infernall furies, more swift then the windes, glided into the Christians Armie; where their glistering beauties so dazeled the eyes of the sixe Christian Champions, and their sober countenances so intrapped their hearts with desire, that their princely valours were abated, and they stood gazing at their excellent proportions, as though Medusaes shaddowes had beene pictured vpon their faces, to whome the intising Ladyes spake in this maner. Come, Princely Gallants, come, away with Armes, forget the soundes of bloudy warre, and hang your angry weapons on the bowre of peace: Venus you see hath sent her messegers from Paphos , to lead you to the paradise of loue: there heauen will raine downe Nectar and Ambrosia sweete for you to feede vpon; and there the melody of Angels will make you musicke: there shall you fight vpon beds of silke, and encounter with inticing kisses. These golden promises so rauished the Champions, that they were inchaunted with their loues, and vowed to take their last farewell of Knighthood and magnanimious Chiualry. Thus were they led from their warlike companies to the Nigromancers inchaunted tent, leauing their souldiers without guiders in danger of confusion. But the Queene of chaunce so smiled vpon the Christians, that at the same time S. George ariued in Persia with a fresh supply of Egyptian Knights: of whose noble atcheiuements I purpose now to speake off: For no sooner had he entred the battell & placed his squadrons, but he had intelligence of the Champions misaduentures, and how they lay inchaunted in a Magicke tent, sleeping in pleasure vpon the laps of infernall furies, the which Osmond had transformed, by his charmes, to the likenes of beautifull Damsels: which vnexpected newes constrained S. George to breathe from his sorrowful heart this wofull lamentation. Unconstant fortune (quoth he) why doest thou entertaine me with such bitter newes? are my fellowe Champions come from Christendome to win immortall honour with their swords, and lie they now bewitcht with beauty? Come they from Europe to fight in cotes of steele, and will they lye distraught in tents of loue? Came they to Asia to purchase Kingdomes, and by bloudy war to ruinate countreys, & will they yeeld their victories to so foule disgrace? O shame and great dishonour to Christendome! O spot to Knighthood and true Chiualrie! this newes is far more bitter to my soule, then was the poysoned dregs yt Antipater gaue to Alexander in his drunkennes, and a deadlier paine vnto my heart, then was ye iuyce that Hanniball suckt from his fatall ring. Come, Champions, come you followers of those cowardly Champions, vnsheath your warlike weapons, and follow him whose soule hath vowed eyther to redeeme them from the Nigromancers charmes, or dye with honour in the enterprize. If euer mortall creatures warred with damned furies, & made a passage to inchaunted dales, where deuils daunce, & warlike shaddowes in the night: then souldiers, let vs march vnto that blacke pauilion, and chaine the cursed charmer to some blasted Oake, that hath so highly dishonoured Christendome. These resolute speaches being no sooner finished, but the whole armie, before daunted with feare, grewe so couragious, yt they protested to follow him through more dangers, then did the Grecian Knights with noble Iason in the Ile of Calcos. Now began the battell againe to renew, & the drums to sound fatall knels for the Pagan souldiers, whose soules the Christian swords by numbers sent to burning Acharon: but S. George , that in valour exceeded the rest, as much as the golden Sun surpasseth the smallest starres in brightnes, with his sword made lanes of slaughtered men, and with his angry Arme made passage through the thickest of their troups, as though that death had beene commaunder of the battell: he caused Crownes and Scepters to swim in bloud, and headlesse Steedes with ioyntlesse men to fall as fast before his sword, as drops of raine before a thunder, & euer in the greatest danger, he incouraged his Souldiers in this maner: Now for the fame of Christendome, fight, Captaines, bee nowe triumphant conquerours, or Christian Martyrs. These words so incouraged the souldiers hearts with inuincible valour, that they neyther feared the Nigromancers charmes, nor all his flaming dragons, nor fiery drakes, that filled the ayre with burning lights, nor daunted at the strange encounters of hellish Legions, that like to armed men with burning Fauchions haunted them: so fortunate were their proceedings, that they followed the inuincible Champion to the inchaunted tent, where as the other Champios lay surfetting in loue, whilest thousands of their freinds fought in fearefull cotes of steele, and merited renowme by their noble atchieuements: for no sooner ariued S. George with his warlike followers before the Pauilion, but he heard as it were, the melodie of the Muses: likewise his eares were almost rauished with the sugred songs of the inchaunted virgins, which like the musicke of Orpheus harpe, caused both stones and trees to daunce, and made elements to shew more brighter then the mornings beautie with drops of hony trickling downe their christall cheekes: the Doues did kisse when they beganne to sing: the running waters daunced, and euery senceles thing did seeme to breathe out sighes for loue: so pleasurable and heauenly were the sights in the Tent, and so delightfull in his eyes, that he had beene inchaunted with their charmes, if hee had not continually borne the honour of Knighthood in his thoughts, and that the dishonour would redound to Christendomes reproache: therefore with his sword he let driue at the Tent, and cut it into a thousand peeces; the which being done, he apparantly beheld where the Nigromancer sate vpon a blocke of steele, feeding his spirits with drops of bloud: who when the Champion beheld, he caused his souldiers to lay hold vpon him, and after chayned him fast to the roote of an olde blasted Oake: from whence, neyther his artes, nor help of all his charmes, nor all the legions of his deuils could euer after lose him: where we will leaue him to his lamentations, filling the ayre with ecchoes of cries, and speake how S. George redeeme the Champions from their inchauntments. First, when he beheld them disrobed of their warlike attire, their furniture hung vp, and themselues securely sleeping vpon the laps of Ladyes, he fell into these discontented speeches: O heauens (sayd he) how my soule abhorres this spectacle! Champions of Christendome, arise, braue knights, stand vp, I say, and looke about like men: are you the chosen Captaines of your countries, and will you burie all your honours vp in Ladies laps? for shame arise, I say, they haue the teares of Crocodiles, the songs of Syrens to inchaunt: to Armes, braue Knights, let honour be your loues: blush to behold your freinds in Armes, and blush to see your natiue countrymen steeping the fieldes of Belgor with their blouds. Champions, arise, S. George calles, the victorie will tarry till you come: arise, and teare this womannish attire, and surfet not in silken robes: put on your steely Corslets, your glistering Burgonets, and vnsheath your conquering weapons, that Belgors fields may bee conuerted into a purple Ocean. These Heroicall speaches beeing no sooner finished, but the Champions like men amazed, rose from their Ladyes bosomes, and being ashamed of their follies, they submissiuely craued pardon, and vowed by protestations, neuer to sleepe in beds of downe, nor neuer vnbuckle their shields from their wearie armes, till they had wonne their credits in the fields again: nor neuer more would be counted his deserued followers, till their triumphs were inrouled amongst the deedes of Martiall Knights. So arming themselues with their approued Corslets, and taking to them their trustie swords, they accompanied S. George to the thickest of their enemies, and left the Nigromancer chayned to the tree, which at their departure breathed foorth these bitter curses: Let helles horror, and tormenting paines (quoth hee) be their eternall punishments: let flaming fire descend the elements, and consume them in their warlike triumphes, and let their wayes be strowed with venimous Porthers, that all their legges may ranckle to their knees, before they march to cursed Christendome. But why exclaime I thus in vaine, when heauen it selfe preserues their happinesse? Now all my Magick charmes are ended, and all my spirits forsake me in my needes, and here am I fast chained vp to starue and die. Haue I had power to rend the vales of earth, and shake the mightie mountaines with my charmes? Haue I had power to rayse vp dead mens soules from kingly toombes, and can I not vnchaine my selfe from his accursed tree? O no, for I am fettred vp by the immortall power of the Christians God; against whom, because I did rebell, I am nowe condemned to euerlasting fire. Come all you Nigromancers in the world, come all you Sorcerers and Charmers, come all you Schollers from the learned Uniuersities; come all you Witches, Beldames, and Fortune-tellers, and all that practise deuillish artes, come take example by the story of my fall. This being sayd, he violently with his owne hands tore his eyes from his head, as a sufficient reuege, because by the directions of their sights, he was first traind in that damned Arte: then betwixt his teeth hee bit in two his lothesome tongue, because it murmured forth so many fatall charmes: then into his thirstie bowels hee deuoured his hands, because they had so often held the siluer wand, wherewith hee had made his charmed circles, and for euery letter, marke, and character, that belonged to his Coniurations hee inflicted a seuerall torment vpon himselfe: and at last, with sightles eyes, speachles tongue, handlesse armes, and dismembred body, he was forced to giue vp his condemned ghost: where, after his ayre of life was vanished from his earthy trunck, the heauens seemed to smile and triumph at his sudden fall, and hell began to rore at the conquest of his death: the ground whereon he died, was euer after that time vnfortunate, and to this present time, it is called in that country, a vale of walking spirits. Thus haue you heard the damned life and miserable fall of this accursed Nigromancer Osmond , whome wee will nowe leaue to the punishments due to such a wicked offender, and speake of the seuen noble and magnanimious Christian Champions. After S. George had ended their Inchauntments, they neuer sheathed vp their swords, nor vnlocked their Armour, till the subuersion of Persia was accomplished, and the Souldan with his pettie Kings taken prysoner. Seuen dayes the battle continued without ceasing: they slew two hundred thousand Souldiers, besides a number that fled away and drowned themselues: some cast themselues headlong downe from the top of high trees, some made murther of themselues, and some yeelded to the mercies of the Christians: But the Soldan with his Princes riding in their Iron chariots, endured the Christians encounters, till the whole armie were discomfited, and then by force and violence they were compelled to yeelde. The Soldan hapned into the hands of S. George , and sixe of his Uiceroyes to the other sixe Champions, where after they had sworne aleageance to the Christian Knights, and had promised to forsake their Mahomet , they were not onely set at libertie, but vsed most honourably: but the Souldan himselfe hauing a heart fraught with despight and tyrannie, condemned the Champions courtesies, and vtterly disdained their Christian gouernments, protesting that the heauens shoulde first lose their wonted brightnes, and the Seas forsake their swelling Tides, before his heart shoulde yeelde to their intended desires: whereupon Saint George beeing resolued to reuenge his former iniuries, commaunded that the Souldan should bee disrobed from all Princely attire, and in base apparell sent to pryson, euen to the same Dungeon where he himselfe had indured so long imprysonment, as you heard in the beginning of the Historie: which strickt commaundement was presently performed: In which Dungeon the Souldan had not long continued, sufficing his hungrie stomacke with the bread of mustie branne, and stanching his thirst with Channel water, but he began to grow desperate and weary of his life, and at last fell into this wofull lamentation: O heauens (quoth he) now haue you throwne a deserued plague vpon my head, and all those guiltlesse soules that in former times my tyrannies haue murthered, may now be fully satisfied: For I that was wont to haue my table beautified with Kings, am now constrained to feede alone in a Dungeon: wherefore sorrow is my foode, & despaire my seruitor: I that haue famished thousands vp in wals of stone, am now constrayned to feede vpon mine owne flesh, or else to starue and dye: yet shall these cruell Christians know, that as I liu'd in tyranny, so will I die: for I will make a murther of my selfe, that after this life, my angry ghost may fill their sleepes with gastly visions. This being said, hee desperately ranne his head against a Marble piller, standing in the middle of the Dungeon, and dasht his braines from out his hatefull head: the newes of whose death, when it was bruted to the Champions eares, they proffered no violence to his liueles body, but intoombed him in a sumptuous Sepulchre, and after that, S. George tooke vpon him the gouernment of Persia, and there established good and Christian lawes: also hee gaue to the other sixe Champions, sixe seuerall kingdomes belonging to the Crowne of Persia, & surnamed them his Uiceroyes or pettie Kings. This being done, hee tooke truce with all the world, and triumphantly marched towards Christendome, with the Conquest of three imperiall Diadems, that is to say, of Egypt, Persia, and Moroco: In which iournie he erected many stately Monuments, in remembraunce of his victories and heroicall atcheiuements, and through euery Countrey that they marched, there flocked to them an innumerable company of Pagans, that desired to follow him into Christendome, and to bee christened in their faith, protesting euer to forsake their gods, whose worshippers were none but tyrants, and such as delighted in nothing but shedding of bloud. To whose requests, S. George presently condescended: not onely in graunting them their desires, but also in honouring them with the fauour of his princely countenance. This courtesie of the English Champion merited such a glistering glorie through the world, that as far as euer the swelling Ocean flowes, and as far as euer the golden globes of heauen extend their lights, S. Georges honour was bruted: and not onely his matchles aduentures caractred in brazen tables, but his martiall exployts painted in euery temple: so that the heathen Poets contriued Histories of his deeds, and cannonized his name amongst ye worthies of the world. In this Princely maner marched S. George with his warlike troups through the territories of Affrica and Asia, in greater royalty, then did Darius with his Persian souldiers towards the campe of time-wondring Alexander . But when the Christian Champions approched the sight of the watry world, and began to goe aboord their shippes, the earth seemed to mourne at their farewels, and the seas to reioyce at their presence, the waues couched as smooth as Chrystall yce, and the windes blewe such gentle gale, as though the sea-gods had beene the directors of their fleete: the Dolphins daunced about the waters, and the louely Mare-maides, in multitudes lay dallying amidst the streames, making them delightfull pastime: the skies seemed to smile, and the Sunne to shew such a glistering brightnes vpon the chrystall waters, that the seas seemed to be of siluer. Thus in great pleasure they passed the time away, committing their fortunes to the mercy of the windes and the waters; who did so fauourably serue them, that in short time they ariued vpon the bankes of Christendome: where being no sooner come on shore, and past the dangers of the Seas, but Saint George in the presence of thousands of his followers, kneeled downe on the ground, and gaue God prayse for his happy ariuall, by these words following: O thou omnipotent God of new Ierusalem, we not onely giue thee condigne prayse, for our late atcheiued victories against thy enemies, who by their wickednesse seeke dayly to pull thee from thy celestiall throne, but also do render thee hearty thankes, that hast deliuered vs safely from the furies of the raging Seas, that otherwise might haue drenched vs in her deuouring gulfe, as thou diddest Pharao with his golden Chariots, and his inuincible Legions: therefore, great King of Iuda, vnder whose name wee haue taken many things in hand, and haue atcheiued so many victories, grant that these true oblations from our tender hearts may be acceptable in thy sight, which be no fained ceremonies: but the inward deuotions of our soules: and there withall letting fall a showre of teares from their eyes, and discharging a vollew of sighes from their brests, as a signification of the integritie of their soules, he held his peace: then gaue he commaundement that the Armie should bee discharged, and euery one rewarded according to his desert, which within seuen dayes was performed, to the great honour of Christendome. After this S. George earnestly requested the other sixe Champions, that they would honour him with their presence home to his Countrie of England, and there receiue the comfort of ioyfull ease, after the bloudy encounters of so many dangerous battels. This motion of S. George not onely obtained their consents, but added a forwardnesse to their willing minds: So incontinently they set forward towards England, vpon whose Chalkie cliffes they in a short time ariued, and after this tooke their iournie towards the Cittie of London, where their entertainments were so honourably performed, as I want the eloquence of Cicero , and the Rethoricke of Caliope to describe it.
