 Slomber, and the other Pamphlets vnto his honor. I meant them rather to Maister Dyer. But I am, of late, more in loue wyth my Englishe Uersifying, than with Ryming: whyche I should haue done long since, if I would the haue followed your councell. Sed te solum iam tum suspicabar cum Aschamo sapere: nunc Aulam video egregios alere Poetas Anglicos . Maister E. K., fl. 1573 hartily desireth to be commended vnto your Worshippe: of whome, what accompte he maketh, youre selfe shall hereafter perceiue, by hys paynefull and dutifull Uerses of your selfe. Thus muche was written at Westminster yesternight: but comming this morning, beeyng the sixteenth of October, to Mystresse Kerkes, to haue it deliuered to the Carrier, I receyued youre letter, sente me the laste weeke: whereby I perceiue you otherwhiles continue your old exercise of Uerisifying in English: whych glorie I had now thought shoulde haue bene onely ours heere at London, and the Court. Truste me, your Uerses I like passingly well, and enuye your hidden paines in this kinde, or rather maligne, and grudge at your selfe, that woulde not once imparte so muche to me. But once, or twice, you make a breache in Maister Drants Rules: quod tamen condonabimus tanto Poet ae, tuaeq, ipsius maximae in his rebus autoritati . You shall see when we meete in London, (whiche, when it shall be, certifye vs) howe fast I haue followed after you, in that Course: beware, leaste in time I ouertake you. Veruntamen te sol um sequar. (vt saepenumero sum professus,) nunquam sane assequar, dum viuam . And nowe requite I you with the like, not with the verye beste, but with the verye shortest, namely with a fewe Iambickes : I dare warrant, they be precisely perfect for the feete (as you can easily iudge) and varie not one inch from the Rule. I will imparte yours to Maister Sidney, and Maister Dyer, at my nexte going to the Courte. I praye you, keepe mine close to your selfe, or your verie entire friendes, Maister Preston, Maister Still, and the reste. Vnhappie Verse, the witnesse of my vnhappie state, Make thy selfe fluttring wings of thy fast flying Thought and fly forth vnto my Loue, whersoeuer she be: Whether lying reastlesse in heauy bedde, or else Sitting so cheerelesse at the cheerfull boorde, or else Playing alone cirelesse on hir heauenlie Virginals. If in Bed, tell hir, that my eyes can take no reste: If at Boorde, tell hir, that my mouth can eate no meate: If at hir Virginals, tel hir, I can heare no mirth. Asked why? say: Waking Loue suffereth no sleepe: Say, that raging Loue dothe appall the weake stomacke: Say, that lamenting Loue marreth the Musicall. Tell hir, that hir pleasures were wonte to lull me asleepe: Tell hir, that hir beautie was wonte to feede mine eyes: Tell hir, that hir sweete Tongue was wonte to make me mirth. Nowe doe I nightly waste, wanting my kindely reste: Nowe doe I dayly starue, wanting my liuely foode: Nowe doe I alwayes dye, wanting thy timely mirth. And if I waste, who will bewaile my heauy chaunce? And if I starue, who will record my cursed end? And if I dye, who will saye: this was, Immerito ? of the best fashion: but loe, an ylfauoured myschaunce. My last farewell, whereof I made great accompt, and muche maruelled you shoulde make no mention thereof, I am nowe tolde, (in the Diuels name) was thorough one mans negligence quite forgotten, but shoulde nowe vndoubtedly haue beene sent, whether I hadde come, or no. Seing it can now be no otherwise, I pray you take all togither, wyth all their faultes: and nowe I hope, you will vouchsafe mee an answeare of the largest size, or else I tell you true, you shall be verye deepe in my debte: notwythstandying, thys other sweete, but shorte letter, and fine, but fewe Ulerses. But I woulde rather I might yet see youre owne good selfe, and receiue a Reciprocall farewell from your owne sweete mouth.

I was minded also to haue sent you some English verses: or Rymes, for a farewell: but by my Troth, I haue no spare time in the world, to thinke on such Toyes, that you knowe will demaund a fr eer head, than mine is presently. I beseeche you by all your Curtesies, and Graces, let me be answered, ere I goe: which will be, (I hope, I feare, I thinke) the next weeke, if I can be dispatched of my Lorde. I goe thither, as sent by him, and maintained most what of him: and there am to employ my time, my body, my minde, to his Honours seruice. Thus with many superhartie Commendations, and Recommendations to your selfe, and all my friendes with you, I ende my last Farewell, not thinking any more to write vnto you, before I goe: and withall committing to your faithfull Credence the eternall Memorie of our euerlasting friendship, the inviolable Memorie of our vnspotted friendshippe, the sacred Memorie of our vowed friendship: which I beseech you Continue with vsuall writings, as you may, and of all things let me heare some Newes from you. As gentle M. Sidney, I thanke his good Worship, hath required of me, and so premised to doe againe. Qui monet, vt faci aes, quod iam facis , you knowe the rest. You may alwayes send them most safely to me by Mistresse Kerke, and by none other. Soonce againe, and yet once more, Farewell most hartily, mine owne good Master H. and vppon you. Per mare per terras, Viuus, mortuusque, Tuus Immerito. Liberalissimo Signor Immerito , in good soothe my poore Storehouse will presently affourd me nothing, either to recompence, or counteruaile your gentle Masterships, long, large, lauish, Luxurious, Laxatiue Letters withall, (now a Gods name, when did I euer in my life, hunt the Letter before? but, belike, theres no remedie, I must needes be euen with you once in my dayes, but only forsoothe, a fewe Millions of Recommendations, and a running Coppie of the Uerses enclosed. Which Uerses, ( extraiocum ) are so well done in Lattin by two Doctors, and so well Translated into English by one odde Gentleman, and generally so well allowed of all, that chaunced to haue the perusing of them: that trust mee, G.H. was at the first hardly intreated, to shame himselfe, and truely, now blusheth, to see the first Letters of his name, stande so neere their Names, as of necessitie they must.

I am at this instant, very busilye, and hotly employed in certaine greate and serious affayres: whereof, notwithstanding (for all youre vowed, and long experimented secreate) you are not like to heare a worde more at the moste, till I my selfe see a World more at the leaste. And therefore for this once I beseech you (notwithstanding your greate expectation of I knowe not what Uolumes for an aunsweare) content your good selfe, with these Presentes, (pardon me, I came lately out of Scriueners shop) and in lieu of many gentle Farewels, & goodly Godbewyes, at your departure: gyue me once againe leaue, to playe the Counsaylour a while, if it be but to iustifie your liberall Mastershippes, Nostri Cato maxime s aecli : and I coniure you by the Contents of the Uerses, and Rymes enclosed, and by al the good, and bad Spirites, that attende vpon the Authors themselues, immediatly vpon the contemplation thereof, to abandon all other fooleries, and honour Uertue, the onely immortall and suruiuing Accident amongst so manye mortall, and euer-perishing Substaunces. As I strongly presume, so good a Texte, so clearkly handeled, by three so famous Doctours, as olde Maister Wythipole, and the other two bee, may easily, and will fully perswade you, howsoeuer you tush at the fourths vnsutable Paraphrase. But a worde or two, to your large, lauishe, laxatiue Letters, and then for thys time, Adieu. Of my credite, youre doubtes are not so redoubted, as youre selfe euer suspiciously imagine: as I purpose shortely to aduize you more at large. Your hotte yron, is so hotte, that it striketh mee to the hearte, I dare not come neare to strike it: The Tyde tarryeth no manne, but manye a good manne is fayne to tarry the Tyde. And I knowe some, whyche coulde be content to bee theyr own Carners, that are gladde to thanke other for theyr courtesie: But Beggars, they saye, muste be no choosers. ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  I honoure more, than you will or can suppose: and make greater accompte of the twoo worthy Gentlemenne, than of two hundreth Dionisij Areopagit ae , or the verye notablest Senatours, that euer Athens dydde affourde of that number. beleeue: and am to requite them wyth better, or worse, at more conuenient leysure. Marry, you must pardon me, I finde not your warrant so sufficiently good, and substauntiall in Lawe, that it can persuade me, they are all, so precisely perfect for the Feete, as your selfe ouer-partially weene, and ouer- confidently auouche: especiallye the thirde, whyche hathe a foote more than a Lowce (a wonderous deformitie in a righte and pure Senarie) and the sixte, whiche is also in the same Predicament, vnlesse happly one of the feete be sawed off wyth a payre of Syncopes: and then shoulde the Orthographie haue testified so muche: and in steade of Heauenli Virginals , you should haue written, Heaunli Virgnals :  & Virgnals againe in the ninth, & should haue made a Curtoll of Imm erito in the laste: being all notwithstandyng vsuall, and tollerable ynoughe, in a mixte, and licentious Iambicke: and of two euilles, better (no doubte) the fyrste, than the laste: a thyrde superfluous sillable, tha a dull Spondee. Then me thinketh, you haue in my fancie somwhat too many Spondees beside: and whereas Trochee sometyme presumeth in the firste place, as namely in the second Uerse, Make thy , whyche thy , by youre Maistershippes owne authoritie muste needes be shorte, I shall be faine to supplye the office of the Arte Memoratiue, and putte you in minde of a pretty Fable in Abstemio the Italian, implying thus much, or rather thus little in effect. A certaine lame man beyng invited to a solempne Nuptiall Feaste, made no more adoe, but sate me hym roundlye downe foremoste at the hyghest ende of the Table. The Master of the feast, suddainly spying his presumption, and hansomely remoouing him from thence, placed me this haulting Gentleman belowe at the nether end of the bourd: alledging for his defence the common verse: sedes nulla datur pr aeterquam sexta Trochaeo : and pleasantly alluding to this foote, which standing vppon two syllables, the one long, the other short, (much like, of a like, his guestes feete) is alwayes thrust downe to the last place, in a true Hexameter, and quite thrust out of doores in a pure, and iust Senarie, Nowe Syr, what thinke you, I began to thinke with my selfe, when I began to reade your warrant first: so boldly, and venterously set downe in so formall, and autentique wordes, as these, Precisely perfit, and not an inch from the Rule? Ah Syrrha, and Iesu Lord, thought I, haue we at the last gotten one, of whom his olde friendes and Companions may iustly glory, In eo sol um peccat, quod nihil peccat : and that is yet more exacte, and precise in his English Comicall Iambickes, than ouer M. Watson himselfe was in his Lattin Tragicall Iambickes, of whom M. Ascham reporteth, that he would neuer to this day suffer his famous Absolon to come abrode, onely because Anap aestus in Locis paeribus , is twice, or thrice vsed in steade of Iambus ? A small fault, ywisse, and such a one in M. Aschams owne opinion, as perchaunce woulde neuer haue beene espyed, no neither in Italy , nor in Fraunce . But when I came to the curious scanning, and fingering of euery foote, & syllable: Lo here, quoth I, M. Watsons Anap aestus for all the worlde. A good horse, that trippeth not once in a iourney: and M. Immerito doth, but as M. Watson, & in a manner all other Iambici haue done before him: marry he might haue spared his preface, or at ye least that same restrictiue, & streightlaced terme, Precisely, and all had been well enough: and I assure you, of my selfe, I beleeue, no peece of a fault marked at all. But this is the Effect of warrantes, and perhappes the Errour may rather proceede of his Master, M. Drantes Rule, than of himselfe. Howsoeuer it is, the matter is not great, and I alwayes was, and will euer continue of this Opinion, Pauca multis condonanda vitia Virtutibus , especially these being no Vitia neither, in a common and licencious Iambicke. Ver um ista obiter, non quidem contradicendi animo, aut etiam corrigendi mihi crede: sed nostro illo Academico, pristinoq more ratiocinandi . And to saye trueth, partely too, to requite your gentle courtesie in beginning to me, and noting I knowe not what breache in your gorbellyed Maisters Rules: which Rules go for good, I perceiue, and keepe a Rule, where there be no better in presence. My selfe neither sawe them, nor heard of them before: and therefore will neither praise them, nor dispraise them nowe: but vppon the suruiewe of them, and farther conference, (both which I desire) you shall soone heare one mans opinion too or fro. Youre selfe remember, I was wonte to haue some preiudice of the man: and I still remaine a fauourer of his deserued, and iust commendation. Marry in these poyntes, you knowe, Partialitie in no case, may haue a foote: and you remember mine olde Stoicall exclamation: Fie on childish affection, in the discoursing, and deciding of schoole matters. This I say, because you charge me with an vnknowne authoritie: which for aught I know yet, may as wel be either vnsufficient, or faultie, as otherwise: and I dare more than halfe promise, (I dare not saye, warrant) you shall alwayes in these kinde of controuersies, finde me nighe hande answerable in mine owne defence. Reliqu ae omnia, quae de hac supersunt Anglicorum versuum ratione, in aliud tempus reseruabimus, ociosum magis . Youre Latine Farewell is a goodly braue yonkerly peece of work, and Goddilge yee, I am alwayes maruellously beholding vnto you, for your bountifull Titles: I hope by that time I haue been resident a yeare or twoo in Italy, I shall be better qualifyed in this kind, and more able to requite your lauishe, and magnificent liberalitie that way. But to let Titles and Tittles passe, and come to the very pointe in deede, whiche so neare toucheth my lusty Trauayler to the quicke, and is one of the pr aedominant humors ye raigne in our comon Youths: Heus mitu, bone proce, magne muliercularum amator, egregie Pamphile, eum aliquando tandem, quite manet, qui mulierosos omnes, qui vniuer sam F aeministarum sectam , Respice finem.

And as for your speedy and hasty trauell: me thinks I dare stil wager al the Books & writings in my study, which you know, I esteeme of greater value, than al the golde & siluer in my purse, or chest, that you wil not, (and yet I muste take heede, how I make my bargaine with so subtile and intricate a Sophister) that you shall not, I saye, bee gone ouer Sea, for al your saying, neither the next, nor the nexte weeke. And then peraduenture I may personally performe your request, and bestowe the sweetest Farewell, vpon your sweetmouthed Mashippe, that so vnsweete a Tong, and so sowre a paire of Lippes can affoorde. And, thinke you I will leaue my Il Pellegrino so? No I trowe. My Lords Honor, the expectation of his friendes, his owne credite and preferment, tell me, he muste haue a moste speciall care, and good regarde of employing his trauaile to the best. And therfore I am studying all this fortnight, to reade him suche a Lecture in Homers Odysses, and Virgils  Æneads, that I dare vndertake he shall not neede any further instruction, in Maister Turlers Trauayler, or Maister Zuingers Methodus Apodemica: but in his whole trauaile abroade, and euer after at home, shall shewe himselfe a verie liuelye and absolute picture of Vlysses capable and apt subiecte (I speake to a Logician) hauing the selfe same Goddesses and Graces attendant vpon his body and mind, that euermore guided them, & their actions: especially ye ones Minerua, and the others Venus: that is (as one Doctor expoundeth it) the pollitique head, and wise gouernement of the one: and the amiable behauiour, and gratious courtesie of the other: the two verye principall, and moste singular Companions, of a right Trauailer: and as perhaps one of oure subtile Logicians woulde saye, the two inseparable, and indivisible accidents of the foresaide Subiects.

Wisedome hir selfe must haue hir doome, and grauest must to graue, And mightiest power sib to a flower: what then remaines to craue? Nowe vp, now downe, we flowe, and rowe in seas of worldly cares, Vertue alone eternall is, and shee the Laurell weares. Soone said, soone writ, soone learnd: soone trimly done in prose, or verse: Beleeud of some, practizd of fewe, from Cradle to their Herse. Virtuto, non tibi Feci . M. Peter Wythipoll. Et Virtuti, & mihi: Virtuti, ad laudem: Mihi, ad vsum.
