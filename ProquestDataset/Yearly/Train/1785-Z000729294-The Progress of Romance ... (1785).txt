 seemed to me that none of them had sounded the depths of it.---Of metrical Romances they have treated largely, but with respect to those in prose, their informations have been scanty and imperfect. When they approach that period of obscurity, which began with the spreading of Christianity over the western world, they drop entirely the latter and equally essential branch of the subject; nor do they resume it, till the sixteenth Century, when Calprenede , the Scuderies, D'Urs e , and other French writers, revived the taste for prose Romances, by their productions. To fill up this chasm in the history of Romance, to rectify the mistakes that have been made by indiscriminate praise or blame, to methodise and arrange the works themselves, and to ascertain as many of the Authors, and the dates of them as I could get information of, to mark the distinguishing characters of the Romance and the Novel, to point out the boundaries of both: and lastly to present to the reader's eye a selection of the best writings of both kinds. These objects would I thought, have a fair claim to the attention of the public; and if executed with fidelity and judgment, would I hoped merit its approbation and encouragement. While I was collecting materials for this work, I held many conversations with some ingenious friends upon the various subjects, which it offered to be investigated and explained. This circumstance naturally suggested to me the Idea of the dialogue form; in which opposite sentiments would admit of a more full and accurate examination, arguments and objections might be more clearly stated and discussed, than in a regular series of Essays, or even letters, not to mention, that the variety and contrast which naturally arise out of the Dialogue, might enliven a work of rather dry deduction, and render it more entertaining to the reader, and not the less useful or instructive.---In this Idea I was confirmed by the great success of some late writers in this way, particularly of Madame de Genlis , in her excellent work called the Theatre of Education. It was not till I had compleated my design, that I read either Dr. Beattie's Dissertation on Fable and Romance , or Mr. Warton's History of English Poetry . ---To the perusal of these books, I was most strongly recommended by two friends, to whom I had shewn my own work, and to whose judgment I owe all possible respect and deference.---I obeyed their injunctions, and have additional obligations to them for the entertainment afforded me by these excellent writers.---I soon found that they neither interfered with my plan, nor had anticipated my subject, yet I own I was well pleased, that neither of these books had fallen in my way before I had finished my own work; as otherwise it might have been supposed that I had borrowed my lights from them, where ever there happened to be a concurrence of opinion, or of representation. Dr. Beattie has walked over the ground, aud marked out its boundaries, but he has paid little attention to its various produce, whether of flowers, herbs, or weeds; except a very few works of capital merit, (some of which he confesses he had not read through) he consigns all the rest to oblivion. Thus Genius thinks it enough to strike out the outline, and leaves to industry and inferior talents, the minuter parts, and more laborious task of detail and arrangement. From Mr. Warton's History of English Poetry , I might indeed have derived considerable advantages, had I met with it sooner. I was happy however to find, that in many instances, my opinions were confirmed, and my arguments strengthened by this learned and judicious writer. It had long been a received opinion, that Romances were communicated to the Western world by the Crusades.--- Mr. Warton allows that they were introduced at a much earlier period, viz. by the Saracens; who came from Africa, and settled in Spain, about the beginning of the eighth Century.--- From Spain he imagines, they found an easy passage into France and Italy.---He further examines the Hypotheses of Dr. Percy and Mr. Mallet ; who derive these fictions from the ancient songs of the Gothic Bards and Scalds: this Idea he allows to be well founded, so far at least as it does not exclude his own System.--- These fictions (he says) had taken deep root in Europe, and prepared the way for the Arabian fables which were introduced in the ninth Century, by which they were in a great measure superseded. That Chivalry, which was the substance of Romance, existed among the Goths he allows, but adds, that under the Feudal establishment, it received new strength and vigour: and was invested with the formalities of a regular institution. ---Which Dr. Percy likewise acknowledges in his remarks on Chivalry; the passage is quoted in the body of this work.---Mr. Warton next proceeds to the Minstrels, Troubadours, and early poets of this country, which is his proper subject; it was entirely beside his plan to enter further into the subject of prose Romances. It is remarkable, that among the many learned and ingenious writers who have treated this subject, few have taken proper notice of the Greek Romances, which may justly be deemed the parents of all the rest. The learned men of our own country, have in general affected a contempt for this kind of writing, and looked upon Romances, as proper furniture only for a lady's Library. ---Not so the French and Italian writers, on the contrary they have not only deemed them worthy their own attention; but have laboured to make them deserving of ours. I mean not however to include all the learned of our country under this observation. ---The names of Hurd, Beattie, Warton, Percy , and Mallet , are an honourable exception, a subject that has been thought worthy of any portion of their time and attention, cannot be undeserving the notice and protection of the public. It is with sincere pleasure I add a name that will not disgrace the list, a writer of my own sex, Mrs. Dobson the elegant writer of the History of the Troubadours and the Memoirs of Ancient Chivalry. In answer to some objections, made by a learned writer, whose friendship does me honour, to my account of the antiquity of Romance-writing; I was led to ask him, why the fictions of the  Ægyptians and Arabians, of the Greeks and Romans, were not entitled to the appellations of Romances, as well as those of the middle ages, to which it was generally appropriated?---I was answered by another question.---What did I know of the Romances of those countries? \---Had I ever seen an Ægyptian Romance? I replied, yes, and I would shortly give him a proof of it. I accordingly compiled and methodised the History of Charoba Queen of Ægypt .--- My friend was surprised and puzzled, and answered me to this effect. "I return your Ægyptian story with thanks; whence you took it, or how far it is your own I know not."--- As I think this piece a great literary curiosity, I shall give it to the public, at the end of this work.---That I may not appear to claim a right to the invention of this story, I shall inform my readers from whence it is taken.---It is extracted from a book called--- The History of Ancient Ægypt, according to the Traditions of the Arabians.--- Written in Arabic, by the Reverend Doctor Murtadi, the Son of Gapiphus, the Son of Chatem, the Son of Molsem the Macdesian.---Translated into French by M. Vattier, Arabic Professor to Louis 14th King of France. This translator in his Preface speaks of this story in high terms. "Were there nothing in this story (says he) worthy of our notice but the Fable of Gebirus and Charoba, with the Adventure of the Shepherd, and the Sea-nymph, I should not repent of my trouble in this Translation.--- I little thought to find in an Arabian writer, a story so nearly resembling the fables of the Greek and Latin poets.---While I was writing, it frequently reminded me of the 4th book of the Odyssey, and of several parts of Ovid's Metamorphoses. This story is mentioned in the ingenious Mrs. Rowe's History of Joseph , a poem not so much known and valued as it deserves to be.---I trust that my readers will not be displeased with a quotation from it. When Totis by his death, the fole command Of Misraim left to fair Charoba's hand; The rich Gebirus from Chaldea came With foreign pomp to seek the royal dame. Chemis adorn'd his train, whose beauteous face Allur'd a goddess of the watery race; On Nilus' banks the young Chaldean stood, When lo Marina rising from the flood! Her chariot set with pearl, the wave divides, Softly along the silver stream she glides, Her robes with sparkling gems transparent shine, Her brighter Eyes express a light divine; Not from her humid bed the blooming day Has e'er ascended with a brighter ray. She leaves her Chrystal vaults and coral groves And o'er the grassy meads with Chemis roves. At parting gave him a celestial spell Which every good procures, and ills expel My mother from this pair derives her line And this she left me, as a gift divine, By all her Ancestors preserv'd with Care; One drop of this shall banish all despair. This curious story will sufficiently answer my purpose, if it only furnishes an additional proof that Romances are of universal growth, and not confined to any particular period or countries. They were the delight of barbarous ages, and they have always kept their ground amongst the multiplied amusements of more refined and cultivated periods, containing like every other branch of human literature, both good and evil things. They are not to be put into the hands of young persons without distinction and reserve, but under proper restrictions and regulations they will afford much useful instruction, as well as rational and elegant amusement. In this view therefore they are equally entitled to our attention and respect, as any other works of Genius and literature.

There are likewise great distinctions to be made between the old Greek Romances, those of the middle ages, and those of the fifteenth and sixteenth Centuries. Books of all these kinds have been enthusiastically read and admired; of late years they have been as absurdly censured and condemned. If read indiscriminately they are at best unprofitable, frequently productive of absurdities in manners and sentiments, sometimes hurtful to good morals; and yet from this Genus there may be selected books that are truly respectable, works of genius, taste, and utility, capable of improving the morals and manners of mankind. truth. properly distinguished or ascertained; that it wants to be methodized, to be separated, classed, und regulated; and that a work of this kind would be both entertaining and useful. accomplished. of building you will raise upon it, I am impatient to hear. your asistance, we will at leisure hours pursue this subject together.

An Epic is a very superior composition. over to my definition; but let us first trace the Origin of our subject. Romances or Heroic fables are of very ancient, and I might say universal Origin. We find traces of them in all times, and in all countries: they have always been the favourite entertainment of the most savage, as well as the most civilized people. In the earliest accounts of all nations, we find they had traditional stories of their most eminent persons, that is of their Heroes , to which they listened in raptures, and found themselves excited to perform great actions, by hearing them recited;---they had their warsongs ---and they had also their prose narratives. ancient, nor so well authenticated an Origin, as you have given them. defend,--- proceed Madam. and moderated to probability.---From the prose recitals sprung History,---from the war-songs Romance and Epic poetry. became acquainted with letters, they could record facts, and this is the  Æra of true History. Before that time a story, that at first was founded on facts, by length of time and passing through many hands, lost many real circumstances, and acquired many fictitious ones. The heathen Mythology is an unanswerable proof of this truth;---what at first was the History of mortal men, and their actions, was at length ascribed to deities; and the veil of Allegory concealed and altered facts, till they could no longer be traced, and at last were lost in fable and obscurity. These Stories, though no longer believed by wise men as truths, yet continued to please as agreeable fictions; and in more enlightened times, men of Genius and fancy, perceiving the pleasure they gave and how willingly they were received, imitated those antient fables, and in process of time composed others of different kinds, following the track of their talents, and the temper of the times in which they lived. obscurity? evidence, as the noblest and most useful of all studies; and let us proceed to Romance, and the Epic poem. from the same root,---they describe the same actions and circumstances,---they produce the same effects, and they are continually mistaken for each other. The Epic poem is always derived from some Historical fact, though perhaps remote and obscure. in Ovid's Metamorphoses ,---but I will bring a fairer comparison.---In the French Romances of the sixteenth Century, they had their foundation in real History; but the superstructure was pure fiction. I will not shelter myself under their authority, I will not speak of them as respectable works. ---Let us compromise.--- If you will permit me to go on in my own way, perhaps I may answer your objections when you least expect it, and I shall call upon you to make them, in due time. to come to the point directly. answer all the scruples of Hortensius. Mankind willingly adopt the prejudices of their ancestors, they embrace them with affection, they quit them with reluctance. One of them is to decry Romance, and venerate Epic Poetry. I believe Hortensius has as few prejudices as any man living; but I must think this to be a strong one, and as such I shall treat it, and endeavour to cure him of it. whether it makes for or against me.---Proceed Madam. countries have had their bards of early times, and their prose Romances afterwards.---Left my opinion should not be sufficient, I shall refer you to Dr. Percy's Essay on the old Metrical Romances , in which he has treated this subject, in so clear and judicious a manner, that nothing I can say is worthy to come after it.---You shall take it home with you, and it will prepare you for our next conversation.

From Pope's admired translation I can discern the strong paintings of his bold imagination, his knowledge and judgment in marking his characters; and above all things, the consideration that the world owes to him, in a great measure, the knowledge of the History and Manners of the times in which he wrote, and of some ages before him; on these and many other accounts, Homer must always claim our respect and even veneration.--- But after all this can you forbear smiling at the extravagant sallies of his imagination, can you approve his violent machinery, in which he degrades his deities below his heroes, and makes deities of men. In a word, if you will not smile with me, I know many of his admirers that will; in spite of the labours of his commentators, who strive with all their strength, to allegorize away his absurdities. prepared to answer you of a sudden, but I shall do it hereafter. obviate your objections.---It is astonishing that men of sense, and of learning, should so strongly imbibe prejudices, and be so loth to part with them.---That they should despise and ridicule Romances, as the most contemptible of all kinds of writing, and yet expatiate in raptures, on the beauties of the fables of the old classic Poets,---on stories far more wild and extravagant, and infinitely more incredible. disdain the comparison of such weak and paltry imitations, as those you have undertaken to support. degree of its enthusiasm, yet I cannot sacrifice the convictions of truth at its shrine. I am of opinion that many of the fine old Historical ballads, are equally entitled to the name of Epic poems. There are examples enough extant, of Romance in verse, and Epics in prose.

You think the divine Homer degraded by my comparisons, yet I will shew you a striking resemblance of him, in a work of much lower estimation:---Did you never read a book called the Arabian Nights Entertainments?

Give me leave to mention one more circumstance relating to this work.---That all doubts of its Origin and Authenticity are removed, by the testimony of several writers well acquainted with the original language: particularly by Lady M. W. Montague , and by Mr. Jones ; both of whom bear testimony to the fidelity of the English translation. imitated Homer as many others have done. that there is frequently a striking resemblance between works of high and low estimation, which prejudice only, hinders us from discerning, and which when seen, we do not care to acknowledge: for the defects of a favourite Author, are like those of a favourite friend; or perhaps still more like our own. surprized, if they have not convinced me, and that I am very desirous she should proceed. request. shall say more in due time and place.

I have traced Romance to an early Origin, and I have mentioned Homer as perhaps the first who gave it a regular model or form: I say perhaps , because there might be others before him: for doubtless there were Stories transmitted from age to age, before they were committed to writing. I have seen some Ægyptian stories, of the fabulous kind, that do not fall very short of those in the Mythology of the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks were always fond of these stories. It is said that one Dearchus , a disciple of Aristotle , wrote Romances; and he has been called the first writer of them. Antonius Diogenes was the author of a work of this kind, called the Errors and Amours of Dinias and Dercyllis. The Amours of Rhodanis and Simonides , are mentioned as very ancient. The Romance of Leucipp e and Clitophon , written by Achilles Tatius , a Greek, he was afterwards a Bishop, and his works are still extant. The Ephesian History by Xenophon , might be reckoned in this class; also the four books of incredible things, written by Damasius. \--- Under the same class may be ranked the fables of Parthonius Nicenus ,---of Athenagoras,--- Theodorus Prodromus,---Eustathius ,---and Longus , ---and many others doubtless, whose names are lost. of uncouth names---to frighten us? later times,--- of these works many are lost, and perhaps you would not be much pleased with those that remain. Xenophon. the most ancient and famous prose Romances is, The  Æthiopic History of Heliodorus , Bishop of Tricca in Thessalia, in the fourth century. It is related, that a Synod considering the danger that might happen to youth, from reading a Romance (though there is nothing in it, in the least degree offensive to morals or modesty,) authorized by the dignity of its author; proposed to him either to burn his book, or resign his Bishopric, and that he chose the latter. There are many testimonies of the merits of this book, both from ancient, and modern writers; but there needs no other evidence, than the circumstance of its having been successively translated into all the known languages. translation before that of 1687. About the year 1720, there was a new and pompous Edition, published under the second Title of Theagenes and Chariclea , which I have seen likewise, but I have some reason to believe it was never a popular book here. respectable; and moreover, it is one of those Romances that are immediately derived from Homer. \---The manners of it are evidently imitative of him, and I desire you to respect it on this account. of the same kind that are now sunk into oblivion: but this may serve as specimen of the Ancient Romance. but I flatter myself you will come within my reach in due time. I thought myself well read in Romance, but I know nothing of any work you have yet mentioned. shall speak first of the Romances of the middle ages; but before I begin I shall read you some extracts from Dr. Percy , which will be of great service in our progress through the Regions of Romance. "That our old Romances of Chivalry may be derived in a lineal descent from the ancient Historical songs of the Gothic bards and scalds will be shown:---and indeed appears the more evident as many of these songs are still preserved in the North, which exhibit all the seeds of Chivalry before it became a solemn institution. "Chivalry, as a distinct military order, conferred in the way of investiture, and accompanied with the solemnity of an oath, and other ceremonies, was of later date, and sprung out of the feudal constitution. ---But the ideas of Chivalry prevailed long before in all the Gothic nation, and may be discovered as in embrio, in the customs, manners, and opinions, of every branch of that people.---That fondness of going in quest of adventures, that spirit of challenging to single combat, and that respectful complaisance to the fair sex, (so different from the manners of the Greeks and Romans), are all of Gothic origin, and may be traced up to the earliest times among all the Northern nations. These existed long before the feudal ages, though they were called forth and strengthened in a peculiar manner under that constitution, and at length arrived at their full maturity in the time of the Crusades, so replete with Romantic adventures."---This extract will I hope answer all your doubts and scruples Hortensius. intentions. making you a convert to myself, but to abler hands. my conviction to nobody, if not to you. beg you my dear friend to proceed.

I shall make no farther mention of the metrical Romances, than is necessary to carry us forward to the prose ones.---When they were become popular in France, Spain, Italy, and some part of Germany, Britain was not unacquainted with them; as witness--- another extract from Dr. Percy \---"The stories of King Arthur and his round table, may reasonably be supposed to be the growth of this Island.

These old Historical songs, inspired the enthusiasm of glory, however they may now be ridiculed.---It is recorded, that at the famous battle of Hastings, the Normans animated their courage, by singing the old Romance, or song of Rollo. \---Dr. Percy says, it was the song of Roland ; but the former seems most likely, because Rollo was their ancient chief, and their Prince traced his descent from him. ---It is indisputable that these songs, had a strong effect upon the hearers;---but I shall have occasion to enlarge upon this subject hereafter. I have said more than I intended on this head, in order to convince Hortensius of the intimate connexion between the Epic poetry, and the old Romance.---Pray observe, that I am now speaking of the OLD Romance, and not of the imitations of it that sprung up many ages afterwards. They are frequently confounded together, and from thence have arisen the erroneous opinions that have been formed of them. I am now speaking of the old Romances of Religion and Chivalry, in which there was a strange mixture of Paganism and Christianity; which was farther promoted by two Monkish writers of those times; one of which under the fictitious name of Turpinus Archbishop of Rheims, wrote a kind of History of Charlemagne , and his twelve peers or Paladins, who drove the Saracens out of France;---the other our Geoffery of Monmouth. From the first of these Ariosto composed, or rather compiled his Orlando Furioso , and Tasso took the hint of his Jerusalem. \--- Dr. Percy says on this head---"Should the public encourage the revival of the ancient songs of Chivalry, they would frequently see the rich ore of an Ariosto or Tasso , though buried under the rubbish and dross of those barbarous times." which I never before thought worth the trouble of enquiring after. though I shall read no more extracts from him. I presume you are by this time convinced, that the Romance and Epic poem are nearly related.---Dr. Percy has given us a list of the remains of the metrical Romances;---at our next meeting I will give you mine of prose ones. For this time I take my leave of you. I shall expect you at my house next Thursday.

I shall now give you my list of the most eminent Romances of the middle ages , with as many of the dates of the publication, as I have been able to procure. I do not pretend to give a regular list of them, but only to note some of the most celebrated ones, and to mark the distinction between the Old Romance , those of the middle ages, and those of the last division nearest our own times; when the passion for these kind of writings was revived in France, in the seventeenth Century. Our own country has produced many, and as early as any in Europe, the Spaniards excepted, who received them from the Moors and Arabians, long before they were known in France or England.--- I am now speaking of the Romances of Chivalry properly so called. Geoffery of Monmouth's History gave birth to most of those Romances, which are founded on English stories. The Romance of Hornechild or King Horne , is one of the oldest, and is of the metrical kind.---I know not the date. Sir Lancelot du Lake. Sir Guy of Warwick. The History of King Arthur and his Knights of the round table. Sir Bevys of Hampton--- Bevis of Southampton. Sir Degorye \---Sir Tristram \---Sir Percevat All these are extant in metre, and many of them in Prose. 1 Guy Earl of Warwick,    Prose,  1292 --------- Richard C aeur de Lyon ,   \---  1247 Historia Alexandria Regis ,    \---  1245 Destruction of Troy ,    \---  1380 There is good reason to believe that Romances were written in Normandy, long before the time of the Troubadours in Provence. You will observe that many of the French Romances are founded upon English stories, ---for instance, Le Mort d' Authure ,    \---  1158 --------- Tristan Chevalier de la table Ronde ,      1150 Le Brut d'Augleterre ,    \---  1155 Richard C aeur de Lyon ,   \---  1360 Sir Beuves de Hamton , persons, among the heroes of Romance. Histories; most of those last mentioned were, and it is worthy your observation, that they have been translated and transcribed from prose to verse, and vice versa : so that the same stories have appeared, and are still extant in both forms.--- I will mention a few more French Romances, before I take notice of those of Spain. Histoire de Quatre fils d' Aymon ,      1156 --------- Le Roman de Rois ,    \---  1160 Sir Eglamour d' Artois. Histoire d' Ippomedon. Tristan Prince de Lyonnois ,      1445 Loves, &c. of the Greek Princes ,     1360 Le Chevalier de la Cigne ,    \---  1435 Roman de Rou. Histoire de Sangraal.

Such as Amadis of Greece,--- Palmerin d'Oliva,---Palmerin of England,--- Belianis of Greece, ---and many others, for which I refer you to Don Quixote's library, as we are not likely to meet with them any where else.---I shall only observe that when the art of printing became established in England, most of the old Romances were re-published that had slept many years.---For instance, Recuyel d'Histoire de Troy , by Caxton , 1470,--- Mort Arthure by the same,--- and many others that I need not mention a second time. There were also some modern Greek Romances,---as Ch aereas & Callirhoe ,--- and Chariton ,---in the 14th Century. extant? an article or two, from a Bookseller's Catalogue, 1777.

"I John de Meun , who formerly upon jealousy, putting Belacoil into prison, taught how to take the Castell, and gather the Rose,  &c."---Many of the French writers extol this Romance very highly, and prefer it to all the works of the Italian Poets; but it is customary with them, to depreciate the writers of other countries, and to magnify their own. As another proof of the affinity of metrical and prose Romances, this famous one was translated into Prose, in the year 1480, by Johan de Moulinet , who is said to have enriched it with many Allegories of his own invention. It afterwards underwent several further alterations, from the different hands it passed through; but still the ground work was the same, and it still preserved its estimation. can give you a specimen of this work, if you wish to hear it.

Religion and virtue, were so blended with fanaticism and absurdity, that the lustre of the former principles, concealed the blemishes of the latter.---At this distance of time we need not be afraid to give our judgment of them, neither ought we to be ashamed to do justice to works of Genius, by whatever name they are called. ---You shall pay it for the sake of those illustrious men, who imbibed their enthusiasm, and carried it into practice. These were the books that caused such a spirit of Chivalry in the youth of much later times, particularly in Spain; such as raised up a Cervantes to attack them; and you will find a curious list of them, in the sixth chapter of the first book of Don Quixote , in the conversation between the Priest and the Barber; in which the Author condemns most of them to the flames. the books it condemns and ridicules? infatuation was so general, that the brightest geniuses, and the wisest men were not exempt from it. ---Our Poetry owes more to it, than you imagine; it was calculated to elevate and warm a poetic imagination, of this I shall bring proofs.

Besides his Galatea ; (of which he speaks with pleasure, and rescues it from the condemned books in Don Quixote's library, and after he had written his Novels upon a new plan,) he composed a serious Romance, called Persiles and Sigismonda , which remains extant, as a proof against him. It is said that he preferred this to all his other works:---he compares it with the  Æthiopics of Heliodorus , being written in the same style and manner.

Mr. Blount who published Lilly 's plays, speaks of this work in his Preface. "Our nation is oblige to Lilly for a new kind of English which he taught it, ---all our ladies were his scholars; and that beauty at Court that could not parl ez Euphuisme ;---that could not converse in his language,---was as little regarded as she who now speaks not French." Other writers speak very differently of this work. One calls it an affected Jargon, in which the perpetual use of metaphors, allusions and allegories, pass for wit, and stiff bombast for fine language; that the court of Elizabeth was miserably infected by it, which helped to let in the vile pedantry that was predominant in the following reign. This diversity of opinions induced me to purchase the book, which by good fortune, I met with soon after. expectation, but there is a certain quaintness and peculiarity, that would not be borne with at this time; yet we should always consider it as written in the dawning of our language, and as a step to the improvement of it, which soon after shone out with great lustre under Shakespear, Fletcher , and Johnson. any relish for it. ---It is printed in the black letter---"The first part is called Euphues or the Anatomy of Wit.---Very pleasant for all Gentlemen to reade, and most necessary to remember; wherein is contained the delights that Wit followeth in his Youth, by the pleasantness of Love, and the happinesse he reapeth in age, by the perfectnesse of Wisdom. ---Printed 1620.

Let us return to our subject.---The next work of merit I shall mention, is Sir Philip Sidney 's Arcadia, which has been highly celebrated, by his contemporaries; and indeed by many later writers. This Romance is of a mixed kind, partaking of the heroic manners of the old Romance, and the simplicity of pastoral life. others of the same class. The Author was reckoned one of the first characters of his age,---or rather the Phoenix of it. this celebrated work:---but I will read you an extract from Mr. Walpole 's catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors.--- "No man seems to me so astonishing an object of temporary admiration as Sir Philip Sidney . The learned of Europe dedicated their works to him, the republic of Poland thought him worthy to be in nomination for their crown.---All the Muses of England wept for his death.---When we at this distance enquire what prodigious merits excited such admiration,---what do do we find?---Great valour.---But it was an age of heroes. In full of all other talents, we have a tedious, lamentable, pedantic, Pastoral romance, which the patience of a young virgin in love, cannot now wade through: and some absurd attempts to fetter English verse in Roman chains; a proof that this applauded author understood little of the genius of his own language. ---The few of his letters extant are poor matters.---By far the best presumption of his abilities as a writer, is a pamphlet, which is an answer to Leicester 's Commonwealth. ---It defends his uncle with great spirit:---he died with the rashness of a volunteer, after having lived to write with the sang froid , and prolixity of Mademoiselle de Scuderi. here. follows.--- "I have been blamed (says Mr. Walpole ,) for not mentioning Sir Philip 's defence of poetry, which some think his best work,--- all that my criticisms pretended to say, was, that I could not conceive how a man who in some respects had written dully and weakly, and who at best was far inferior to our best Authors, had obtained such immense reputation.---Let his merits, and his same be weighed together, and then let it be determined whether the world has overvalued, or I have undervalued the character of Sir Philip Sidney ." of the question; there will remain qualities enough, to justify the respect paid to Sir Philip , by his contemporaries. that fell under Mr. Walpole 's consideration, and also that it is a man who is the author of this critique. of a work that has always been a favourite with her sex? deference upon all occasions. The Arcadia is addressed to his accomplished sister the Countess of Pembroke, and is commonly called, Pembroke's Arcadia. superior to any of the Romances of the same period. The prose part of it, is much superior to the poetry; as will appear by comparing it with that of his contemporaries.

A writer of the last Century thus speaks of it.--- "The philosophy and politics of Barclay's Argenis , have made it worthy of the perusal of the greatest statesmen and scholars." The name of Romance, even in our days, had prejudiced many people against it--- you among the rest Hortensius. purpose in reviving an old Romance; but on reading it, I was convinced that it was a work of real merit, and deserved a better reception. themselves better, before they presumed to impose their opinions upon the public, which they have misinformed, and put it out of their power to rectify the erroneous opinions they have occasioned. that I thought ill-natured, but I do not recollect the particulars. 1772,--- "Notwithstanding the pains taken in an Advertisement to put off this Phoenix, for an Original work, we will venture to pronounce it a translation of the Argenis of Barclay ,---That a Lady may have given us a translation of that composition is not impossible; but we rather imagine that an old translation has been modernised.--- The Argenis has been highly commended by several learned and ingenious men, but we own ourselves to have no relish for the Romances of the last Century, we are sufficiently satisfied with those of the present."--- What think you of this sentence? is calculated to prejudice the public against it:---but pray had this mandate any effect upon the sale of your publication? friends who cannot be biassed by these self elected censors of books.---If these doughty Critics, had read the Preface only , they would have been satisfied, that neither the Editor , nor the Publisher , ever intended to put off this Phoenix for an original work ; though by its being advertised with some other original publications, it gave a pretence to those who look no farther than advertisements , to put so unfair a construction on it. Argenis of Barclay ,--- amazing penetration, and equal discretion!--- had they afforded so much of their precious time, as was necessary to read the Preface only, they would have known that the Editor was so far from desiring to disguise or conceal the truth, that she took pleasure and pride in acknowledging it and, in short they would have met with a full confutation of every point they advanced against her. upon themselves. and gave their sentence, by guessing at the contents of the book. their labours, which if they were not well paid for, they would soon discontinue.---It is not in their power to add to, or take away from the reputation of Barclay 's Argenis , whatever it may have gained or lost by any of its translators or commentators. the Preface , nay they commended it, and paid due respect to the Original writer: but they objected to the politics, as local and temporary; and to the principles of government, as absolute and arbitrary.--- They took no notice that the high monarchical principles of Barclay were moderated by the Editor. I could also have wished them to have cast an eye upon the Poetry, which is no inconsiderable part of the work, nor, as I hope, the worst executed. I confess I was mortified to find they did not; for though I expected they would find something to correct, I hoped they would likewise find something to commend.---But I have said too much upon this subject, and shall conclude with observing, it was the best book I ever gave the public, and the worst received. ask a question, ---how came you to alter the Original title, and call it the Phoenix? advised, and even insisted upon a new Title , and I the rather gave way to his demand, because there was another Translation offer'd to the press, and intended to be published at the same time; and I thought my friends would know mine by this distinction:---this was the private reason hinted at in the Preface, which was ridiculed by the Reviewers. had only told the plain narrative, and omitted all the fine Essays, (the most valuable part of the work,) and the poetry also; it had saved me much time and labour, and would have pleased more readers. but enough of this. I must observe that J. Barclay was of Scotish parentage, but born and educated in France, and that he was an accomplished gentleman. Those who desire to know more of him, must read his works;---which are, The Argenis , and Euphormio , a satyrical work. You are now I trust convinced of the affinity of Prose, and metrical Romances. Chaucer's Canterbury tales would tell equally well in verse or prose. His Knight's tale is a complete Epic, and in Dryden's opinion very little inferior to the Iliad or the  Æneis.--- "The story (says he) is more pleasing, the manners as perfect, the diction as poetical, the learning as deep and various, and the conduct as artful." Permit me to remark that Dryden's elegant, rich, and harmonious numbers, have preserved this, and many other of Chaucer's works, from sinking into oblivion, and he has given the old Bard a share of his own immortality. Spenser's Faery Queen , is confessedly a Romance versified. Fenelon's Telemachus , is an Epic in prose. ---The Telemachus is a work above all praise, and demands our notice here, as being a story of the Heroic kind. Ramsey's Cyrus is an excellent work, but it has more of the cast of History than of Romance. I mention both these charming books rather out of time, because they are of a different species, from the modern stories or Novels. so very briefly of them. I shall now draw towards a conclusion of Romances properly so called.---I shall read you an extract, which is the conclusion of the conversation of the Canon and the Curate in the fourth book of Don Quixote ; in the course of which, all the absurdities of Romances have been exposed and criticised.--- "The subject of a Romance (says the Canon) affords an ample field for a good Genius to display itself.---He may weave a web of such various and beautiful texture, that the perfection of it may attain to the ultimate end of all writing, which is to delight and instruct mankind; because this unconfined way of writing, gives an Author room to shew his skill, in the Epic or the Lyric way, in Tragedy or Comedy; with all the parts included in the sweet and charming sciences of Poetry and Oratory:" ---for the Epic may be written in prose , as well as verse , repay our obligations to you.

Huet Bishop of Avranches , who wrote a formal treatise upon the Origin of Romances, has said little or nothing of them, in that superficial work.--- Having brought down the account of Romances to the later Greeks, and enter'd upon those of the western writers, which have now the name of Romances almost appropriated to them, he puts the change upon his readers, and instead of giving us an account of these books of Chivalry, he contents himself with a long account of the poems of the Provencal writers, which are called likewise Romances:---and so, under the equivoque of a common term, drops his proper subject, and entertains us with another, that had no relation to it more than in the name." as to make them irresistable. treatise, but was disappointed. I expected an account of the Milesian Tales, which are often mentioned by those who treat on this subject, and I made a brief extract, of what fills many pages in Mons. Huet's book. He says that the Ionians were the most corrupt and dissolute of all the Asiatic Greeks,--- that they fell under the dominion of Cyrus , when he conquered Asia Minor,---that the Persians imbibed their manners, and became the most voluptuous people in the world. But, in them and a taste for elegant pleasures, the Milesians surpassed them all. They were the first that introduced Romance writing among the Persians, which obtained the highest reputation in those times.---That the Milesian Fables are full of licentious stories and amorous adventures, which gave offence to those of the graver sort.---He thinks it probable that Romances were innocent till they fell into their hands, and that before that time they only recounted memorable and singular adventures. He says that their works are devoured by time, and yet, afterwards, advances several conjectures concerning them. If they were such as he describes, they are best buried in oblivion. It is the opinion of many learned men, that the works of Lucian , and likewise of Apuleius , are derived from these Milesian sables. Mons. Huet runs over the names of many fabulous and some real Authors, but as they are only names, they are of no great consequence. most perfect of all works of this kind; and says they deserve the same compliment that Horace paid to the Iliad of Homer ,---that they teach Morality more effectually, than the precepts of the most able Philosophers.

Give me leave to introduce to you a set of men all of whom read, and some of them wrote Romances: ---men who, as all the world allows, had no small portion of Romance in their composition, and were excited by a strong and enthusiastic thirst of glory, to actions honourable to themselves, and advantageous to their country. Such were the heroes of Queen Elizabeth's court; and I might reckon the Queen herself as an Heroine, worthy to command such men. subject. The Prince who can select, and employ such men, deserves the glory he derives from them; and while he uses their abilities, does himself the greatest honour.

The French army used to sing the song of Rolando or Orlando ; to excite their courage before a battle.---King John of France, (the same who died in England in 1364,) said one day, to those who had been singing this famous song,---"It is a long time since there has been any Rolando's among the French." ---an old Captain made him the following answer,---"Sire, we shall see again the Rolando's , when we have another Cherlemagne ." never read the life of Lord Herbert , written by himself? to the character of Don Quixote ; but his noble spirit, and fine qualities, concealed or excused his knight-errantry. Certainly these men were animated by great and generous principles, to expose their lives continually to obtain what they thought infinitely more valuable,--- an honourable name and memory. I have a curious book, of the lives and actions of Q. Elizabeth's worthies, who were all men of this stamp. I will give you an anecdote from thence, as a specimen of the spirit of those times. "The Lord Montjoy (above mentioned,) was of a bold and daring spirit. When very young, he went abroad as a volunteer without the Queen's permission, for which he was severely checked by her and forbidden to do so again;---notwithstanding this, he stole away a second time, and went with Sir John Norris into Brittany and made a campaign there,---at his return the Queen reproved him sharply before the whole court, in the following words.---Serve me so again, and I will lay you fast enough!--- you will never leave, till you are knock'd on the head, like that rash and inconsiderate fellow Sydney .---It is time enough for you to go abroad when I send you, till then stay at home, read your books, and study the art of war, against you are called to the practice of it." There is something in this aspiring spirit that affects one,---we cannot help admiring and lamenting this enthusiasm of glory. Oh fatal love of fame!---Oh glorious heat!--- Only destructive to the brave and great !--- one's heart, with a degree of their enthusiasm!---but surely Madam, you do not assert that Romances inspired these men to perform all these great actions? warmed at the bare mention of them; and doubtless they were excited by the great names they had heard and read of. The effects of Romance, and true History are not very different. When the imagination is raised, men do not stand to enquire whether the motive be true or false.--- The love of glory has always a certain enthusiasm in it, which excites men to great and generous actions, and whatever stimulates this passion, must have the credit of the actions it performs. On the contrary, whenever this spirit, and this enthusiasm, become the objects of contempt and ridicule, mankind will set up for themselves an idol of a very different kind. ---They will then devote themselves to mean or mercenary pursuits which debase and corrupt the mind.---The thirst of immoderate wealth or pleasure, will engross their attentions and desires; or else they will sink into a state of supine indolence, and become entirely negligent of what they owe to themselves, to their connexions, or to their country.--- There must be a stimulus to excite men to action, and such as is the motive, such will the action be. comparison.---The ambition of our age, and country, is indeed of a very different kind. had lived in later times.---"The youth of our country, says he, instead of desiring to signalize themselves abroad, contract an avaritious desire of enriching themselves at home, by the spoils of their own country." the balance will turn; in favour of public spirit, or private virtue. Let us suppose the character of Don Quixote realized, with all its virtues and absurdities. I would ask, whether such a man is not more respectable, and more amiable, than a human being, wholly immersed in low, groveling, effeminate, or mercenary pursuits, without one grain of private virtue, or public spirit; whose only thoughts, wishes, and desires, are absorbed in a worthless self? We ridicule the enthusiasm of honour and glory, and run headlong into the gulph of folly and dissipation, ---we throw aside forms and ceremonies, and fink into carelessness and negligence; ---we despise decorum and preciseness, and plunge into licentiousness. fashion, and bring it within the barriers of reason and morality.

Romances have for many ages past been read and admired, lately it has been the fashion to decry and ridicule them; but to an unprejudiced person, this will prove nothing but the variations of times, manners, and opinions.---Writers of all denominations,---Princes and Priests,--- Bishops and Heroes,---have their day, and then are out of date.---Sometimes indeed a work of intrinsic merit will revive, and renew its claim to immortality: but this happiness falls to the lot of few, in comparison of those who roll down the stream of time, and fall into the gulph of oblivion. Upon the whole, I think, we may conclude, that Romances in general are neither the sublime compositions which their enthusisiastic admirers have represented them; or so contemptible and pernicious as some prejudiced men have described them.---If upon a fair and impartial review of them, it appears, that they inculcated the greater principles of virtue and honour; though (in the times of Gothic ignorance) they might be productive of many absurdities, and some real evils; yet they were by no means so dangerous, as many writings of later times, of which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. I have the courage to maintain that the most eminent works of this class are entitled to our notice and respect; and that even the most heavy and prolix of them, are, at least, as innocent and inoffensive, as any of the rest of the genuine offspring of dulness. done them, and promise you that I never again will disturb their repose. whatever way you please to understand it. am sincerely obliged to you for the entertainment and information you have given me; and as soon as your leisure will permit, I beg you to meet at my house and continue your progress. beg you to give me your assistance in future.

The Romance is an heroic fable, which treats of fabulous persons and things.--- The Novel is a picture of real life and manners, and of the times in which it is written. The Romance in lofty and elevated language, describes what never happened nor is likely to happen.---The Novel gives a familiar relation of such things, as pass every day before our eyes, such as may happen to our friend, or to ourselves; and the perfection of it, is to represent every scene, in so easy and natural a manner, and to make them appear so probable, as to deceive us into a persuasion (at least while we are reading) that all is real, until we are affected by the joys or distresses, of the persons in the story, as if they were our own. distinction.---I clearly perceive the difference between the Romance and Novel, and am surprized they should be confounded together. who endeavour to render all writings of both kinds contemptible. them with the greatest disdain, especially collegians. not to be offended with impunity.

Let us next consider some of the early Novels of our own country. We had early translations of the best Novels of all other Countries, but for a long time produced very few of our own. One of the earliest I know of is the Cyprian Academy , by Robert Baron in the reign of Charles the First.--- Among our early Novel-writers we must reckon Mrs. Behn .---There are strong marks of Genius in all this lady's works, but unhappily, there are some parts of them, very improper to be read by, or recommended to virtuous minds, and especially to youth.--- She wrote in an age, and to a court of licentious manners, and perhaps we ought to ascribe to these causes the loose turn of her stories.--- Let us do justice to her merits, and cast the veil of compassion over her faults.---She died in the year 1689, and lies buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.---The inscription will shew how high the stood in estimation at that time. in her, what you would not to a man? this lady had many fine and amiable qualities, besides her genius for writing. inscription on her monument, I do not remember it.

Let me add that Mrs. Behn will not be forgotten, so long as the Tragedy of Oroonoko is acted, it was from her story of that illustrious African, that Mr. Southern wrote that play, and the most affecting parts of it are taken almost literally from her. works. The next female writer of this class is Mrs. Manley , whose works are still more exceptionable than Mrs. Behn's , and as much inferior to them in point of merit.---She hoarded up all the public and private scandal within her reach, and poured it forth, in a work too well known in the last age, though almost forgotten in the present; a work that partakes of the style of the Romance, and the Novel. I forbear the name, and further observations on it, as Mrs. Manley 's works are sinking gradually into oblivion.

The life of Cleveland , natural son of Oliver Cromwell , is one of the old Novels , if I may be allowed the expression, I do not certainly know the Author, nor yet the date of the first edition.---When a Novel came out but seldom, it was eagerly received and generally read, this was at the time called a work of uncommon merit, but it will not bear a comparison with those that have been written since.

Gaudentio di Lucca is written by the pen of a master, it is imputed to Bishop Berkely , and is not unworthy of that truly venerable man.---There is a greatness of design, and a depth of penetration into the causes of the health and prosperity of a state, and of the moral evils that first weaken and undermine, and finally cause the ruin of it. The vast consequence of the good or bad education of youth, on which depends the health, vigour, and happiness of a nation.--- These circumstances gives this book a manifest superiority to the other, in many other respects they are both equally entitled to our plaudit.--- But what gives a still higher value to these two books, they are evidently written to promote the cause of religion and virtue, and may safely be put into the hands of youth.---Such books cannot be too strongly recommended, as under the disguise of fiction, warm the heart with the love of virtue, and by that means, excite the reader to the practice of it.

Rousseau saw that the women on the Continent, while maidens, paid due respect to their honour and character, but as soon as they were married they entertained all the world, and encouraged gallants; of the two evils he thought a single person's indulging a criminal passion, of less pernicious consequence to society, than a married woman who commits adultery:---upon this principle he wrote this book.---He puts the character of a woman who encourages lovers after marriage, in opposition to one who having committed the greatest fault before marriage, repents, and recovers her principles.---He inforces the sanctity of the marriage vow, he sets the breach of it in a light to shock every considerate mind, he shews that where it is broken, nothing but hatred and disgust succeeds; the confidence a man should place in his wife, the tenderness he should feel for his offspring, is destroyed, and nothing remains but infamy and misery. If Rousseau intended by this work to give a check to this shameful intercourse of the sexes, so frequently practiced on the Continent, under the specious name of gallantry, he is to be commended; and if it produced effects he did not foresee, he ought to be excused. apology for his Eloise . But after all the objections remain. It is a dangerous book to put into the hands of youth, it awakens and nourishes those passions, which it is the exercise of Reason, and of Religion also, to regulate, and to keep within their true limits. On this account I have often wished that the two first Volumes of Eloise , could be abridged and altered, so as to render them consistent with the unexceptionable morals of the two last.---I thought it might be possible to give a different turn to the story, and to make the two Lovers, stop short of the act , that made it criminal in either party to marry another, for were they not actually wedded in the sight of heaven? and could Elaise with any pretensions to virtue, or to delicacy, give herself to another man? If this insuperable objection was removed; then might the Lovers renew their friendship with honour and dignity on both sides, then might the husband in full confidence in his wife's principles, invite her friend, and even leave them together without appearing so justly-ridiculous in his conduct as he now does to impartial judges. yourself. attempt it, or to think myself able to do justice to Rousseau in such an alteration.---It must remain as it is, it has done all the mischief in its power to the youth of this generation; and the worst part of it is, that those who write only for depraved and corrupted minds, dare appeal to Rousseau as a precedent. believe that Rousseau himself would be concerned for them;---but what will you say of his Emilius? afraid much more harm. The discussion of its merits and defects would lead me too far from the present subject, especially as it does not properly belong to this class of writing.--- Rousseau is a whimsical and chimerical writer, with great beauties and great blemishes, and I am convinced he did not really intend to hurt the principles or morals of mankind. who so cruelly scourges him? and his malignity, likewise, against Revelation; and in doing injury to Religion, he injures the rights and the happiness of society. throwing dirt at each other:---to see the Author of Candide taking exceptions at the character of Wolmar. knaves quarrel, honest men recover their own."--- Thus a Christian may know what confidence to place in the enemies of his religion.--- But pray give us your opinion of Candide? what the Reviewers say of it. for the best .--- An absurd improbable tale, written with an apparent view to depreciate not only human nature, but the wisdom and goodness of the Supreme Being; and ridicule his providence under that generally received and worthily adopted principle---All for the best."---Gramercy Messrs. the Reviewers, I subscribe to your sentence with all my heart. which I would rather have avoided: his wit is indisputable, but wit is only a secondary merit; and when it is abused and made an instrument to do mischief, it becomes detestable. eminence in your walk, ---and will you say nothing more of his Novels? found by those, who think it worth their while to seek them. pursue your journey, and to mention other writers. we meet, we must make quicker dispatch, or this progress of ours, will be too long before it comes to an end. to you.

Marquis de Roselle , by Madame Elie de Beaumont . I have a partiality for this book, I never read one of the kind that afforded me greater pleasure; in it the noblest lessons of virtue and good conduct are conveyed to the reader's mind, through the vehicle of entertainment; it may be recommended to young persons, to guard them against the deceptions of the world, and to enable them to distinguish between real and intrinsic merit, and the tinsel accomplishments of the circle of dissipation. ---This translation was published in 1764. writings of Madame de Beaumont worth your notice. name, with only a small distinction between them--- Madame Elie de Beaumont is the Author of the Marquis de Roselle .---Madame le Prince de Beaumont has written many books for the use of Schools Le Magazin des Enfans and others for youth in a series.---She has also written Novels for grown Gentlemen and Ladies , but none of first rate Merit. there is also a book of the same title, which was published in Ireland, which I think superior to the French one, but neither of them are capital.--- Madame le Prince Beaumont 's writings are strongly tinctured with bigotry and enthusiasm, but the always means to support the cause of virtue.---If I am not misinformed she presides over a seminary of Education, or in plain English, she keeps a school. faithfully discharged, claims our respect, and an honourable mention. ---The year 1766 was very prolific in the Novel way, and indeed, they seem to have over-run the press, till they became a drug in the terms of trade .--- The Reviewers complain bitterly of the fatigue of reading them, it became necessary to have an Annual Supply for the Circulating Library, in consequence the manufacturers of Novels were constantly at work for them, and were very poorly paid for their labours.--- Among the trash the press groaned under, some works of merit appeared which discredited the trifling ones, and helped to drive them off the Stage. Sir George Ellison , a picture of a truly benevolent man. Sir Charles Beaufort , strong painting of shocking characters, which are made triumphant over Innocence and Virtue John Buncle, Esq .---a whimsical and outr e story, intermixed with sprinklings of wit and Learning, and a Genius truly original.

Arthur O'Bradley has more humour, than wit or sentiment, but is above the common Novels of this date---1769. The Persian Tales of Inatulla are worth reading, but I shall class them with other Tales and Fables of the same kind. the Readers of the Circulating Library, some persons whose excellent principles led them to see and lament the decline of virtuous manners, and the passion for desultory reading; endeavoured to stem the torrent by making entertaining stories their vehicle to convey to the young and flexible heart, wholsome truths, that it refused to receive under the form of moral precepts and instructions, thus they tempered the util e with the dulc e , and under the disguise of Novels, gave examples of virtue rewarded, and vice punished; and if the young mind unawares to itself, was warmed with the love of virtue, or shocked at the punishment of the wicked; this was all the reward they wished or expected from their Labours. Of this kind are the following works: --- Callistus , or the Man of Fashion , by Mr. Mulso. The Exemplary Mother , by Mrs. Cooper. The Placid Man , by Mr. Jenner. The Fool of Quality , by Mr. Brooke. This last I must enlarge upon.---Mr. Brooke was a man of Genius, taste and sensibility, but unhappily these fine talents were over- shadowed by a veil of Enthusiasm, that casts a shade upon every object. I will not trust myself to give a character to works of so mixed a kind. Let us see what the Reviewers say of it. Hortensius , be so kind to turn to the Index for The Fool of Quality. amiable and worthy characters drawn by this able writer, it is with real concern that we see them debased by the ascetic reveries of Madame Guyon, William Law , and the rest of the repturous tribe.---What can we say more of a performance, which is at once enriched by Genius, enlivened by fancy, bewildered with enthusiasm, and overrun with the visionary jargon of fanaticism? "We shall only add our hearty with that the ingenious writer, would give us an abridgement of this work, cleared from the fanctimonious rubbish by which its beauties are so much obscured;---and then, we are persuaded, it would be perused with pleasure by readers of every rank and age; but while it remains in its present motley state, we apprehend it will be a favourite with only Behmenites, Hernhutters, Methodists, Hutchinsonians , ---and some Roman Catholics. , Mr. Brooke 's other Novel in which fanaticism is predominant. I shall offer a conjecture of my own, that Mr. Brooke would never have condescended to write Novels, but to make them his vehicles to convey his tenets to the minds of such readers, as were not likely to receive them in any other form. to promote a blind and illiberal zeal to make proselytes! and to limit the mercies of God to one particular sect of Christians. .---The growth of fanaticism is an alarming consideration; it is creeping into every sect among us, nay even into the established national Church. rational piety, and moderation, are in no very good situation, for they are anathemiz'd by the zealots of both parties.---Let us leave them to him who knows best how to separate the grain from the chaff , and return to our subject. Letters from an English Lady at Paris , in which are contained the Memoirs of Mrs. Williams .---1769. This is a work of real merit, I have here an extract from the Review .---'The whole of this work forms a most interesting, exemplary tale, abounding with affecting incidents, sensible observations, and moral reflections:---and some of the letters are enlivened with a vein of pleasantry, which will afford an agreeable relief to such readers as are not fond of distressful events, and melancholy scenes.'

Friends in the Country , which in my opinion has great merit. Placid Man , of whom I shall have occasion to say more, when we come to our moral inferences. The History of Charles Wentworth, Esq ; is a work of Genius and Originality, but it is not proper for all readers, it is strongly tinctured with Deism, and is evidently written in favour of that uncomfortable System, and like Rousseau , he appeals to savages in confirmation of his tenets;it is therefore an improper book for youth. The Man of Feeling \---and the Man of the World , are by the same Author, Mr. Mackenzie . ---both are moral, natural, and pathetic, aud worthy of our plaudit; if there is any defect, it is that some of the scenes are shocking representations of human nature, and bear too hard upon the readers humanity and sensibility. it would make our task too long and tedious, I must therefore pass over these, and hundreds beside that are very innocent and moral books.

I have spoken largely of the Arabian Nights Entertainment as a work of Originality and Authenticity, and let me add of amusement. The great demand for this book, raised a swarm of imitations, most of which are of the French manufactory, as the Persian Tales ---Turkish Tales---Tartarian Tales---Chinese Tales---Peruvian Tales---Mogul Tales--- &c. The stories of this kind are all wild and extravagant to the highest degree; they are indeed so far out of the bounds of Nature and probability, that it is difficult to judge of them by rules drawn from these sources.--- It cannot be denied that some of them are amusing, and catch hold of the readers attention.

There are many other books of this class, but these are all within my knowlege that are worthy of mention. There would be no end of reciting the names of these Tales. There was a passion at all times for story-telling in all the countries beyond the Levant.---I remember an incident in a book of travels that is a proof of the continuance of this custom. The traveller had engaged himself to make a journey into Upper Egypt, without the knowledge and consent of his friends, in search of antiquities, and to carry on a traffic privately for precious stones.---The dangerous circumstances attending this negociation, and the other hazards he run of perishing in a barbarous country, affected his mind and disturbed his rest; he confessed to his friend and patron, that he suffered much from his inward agitations. His patron rallied him upon his want of resolution, and asked him if he had not yet learned the Turkish method of calming his mind?---The traveller thought he meant the use of opium or some drug of that kind, but he soon after called for a young man his servant, and ordered him to take up a book and read where he left off the night before, ---the youth did as he was directed, and read a very pleasant story, to which the traveller was attentive, and found his mind relieved and comforted.---When the lad had done reading, his master raised many questions, and made remarks upon the story, and then spoke to his guest as follows:---"You see my friend, that we are not such Barbarians as many of the Franks believe us,---your people are extremely vain and conceited of their own customs, and yet provoked to see others tenacious of theirs; they laugh at our Turkish stories, and at this method of soothing our cares; yet I conceive that it is as natural and as innocent as gaming, or drinking great quantities of wine, which are your common diversions."---The traveller could not help admitting the truth of what he said, and observed, that it was strange that writers of Travels should censure the Turks and Moors for their passion for hearing Tales and Stories, when at the same time if this inclination did not prevail among Christians, their books could not be read at all." subject,---I will produce another of the same kind. M. de Guys in his Sentimental Journey through Greece , takes notice of the same passion for tales and stories.---When a party of women met together they frequently entertained each other with telling a story in turn, which amusement is called Paramythia . ---He describes some young girls at their needle-work, one of them says, "Come, let us have a party at the Paramythia , these pretty amusements will lighten our work.---I will tell you the fine Persian story my father taught me." times, and all countries, and varies only according to the customs and manners of different people; and those who most affect to despise them under one form, will receive and admire them in another. them an innocent or a pernicious amusement. I have now done with Eastern Tales and Stories. Johnson's sentiments on this head, and was satisfied with his decision: but I have since read Mr. M c Nichol's Remarks upon Johnson's Tour  , and that overset all that the Doctor had said. There is something imperious and dogmatical in his manner of criticizing, and in the present case he seems to have wanted both judgment and candour.---On the other hand, M c Nichol shews too much of bitterness and acrimony, and of the same national pride as he condemns in Johnson , but he appeals to facts and to living persons of character and veracity, and such evidence is not easily set aside. settle their disputes between themselves, and give us your own opinion. that I must relate another curious circumstance. A friend of mine wrote to a young gentleman who was in the Highlands, observing the remains of Antiquity there, and making enquiry into the authenticity of Ossian 's works. My friend sent the traveller a fragment of his own composing, in imitation of Ossian 's manner---He shewed it to several persons in the Highlands, and asked what they thought of it?---they told him it was one of Ossian 's fragments, and they remembered it perfectly well.---This proof of disingenuity in support of the national claim to Ossian 's credit, renders very doubtful every account we receive from the natives of his country. opinion upon this complicated evidence. and you must bear whatever blame I shall incur. I believe that Mr. Macpherson collected together all the traditional stories of the Highlands, that he put them into his own loom, and wove them into a regular piece. His works bear strong marks of genius and Originality, they are bold and figurative, and some of them are highly pleasing.

As this kind of reading is so common, and so much in every body's power, it is the more incumbent on parents and guardians to give young people a good taste for reading, and above all to lay the foundation of good principles from their very infancy; to make them read what is really good, and by forming their taste teach them to despise paltry books of every kind.---When they come to maturity of reason, they will scorn to run over a circulating Library, but will naturally aspire to read the best books of all kinds. the middling and lower ranks of people, I apprehend this would not hinder either children or servants from reading Novels. every rank and situation, people may superintend the education of their children, and " train them tip in the way they should go ."

With all these precautions in view, I would select such books as were proper to be put into the hands of youth; and with the same circumspection I would carry them to the Theatres, to satisfy the curiosity of youth, and prevent their taking these amusements clandestinely, for how in an age like this, cou'd I flatter myself I cou'd prevent them?

But Euphrasia is looking over her extracts, she has more to say to you. under the title of Novels, are designed as an antidote to the bad effects of them. I have some Extracts from these, which I hope you will think worthy of your attention. But first I shall give you an Extract from A Comparative View of the State and Faculties of Man, with those of the Animal World , by Dr. Gregory , a work generally read and admired. " Notwithstanding the absurdities of the old Romance, it seems calculated to produce more favorable effects on the morals of mankind than our modern Novels. If the former did not represent men as they really are, it represented them better. Its heroes were patterns of courage, truth, generosity, humanity, and the most exalted virtues,---its heroines were distinguished for modesty, delicacy, and the utmost dignity of manners. The latter represent mankind too much what they really are, and paint such scenes of pleasure and vice as are unworthy to see the light, and thus in a manner hackney youth in the ways of wickedness before they are well entered into the world; they expose the fair sex in the most wanton and shameless manner to the eyes of the whole world, by stripping them of that modest reserve, which is the foundation of grace and dignity, the veil with which nature intended to protect them from too familiar an eye, in order to be at once the greatest incitement to love, and the greatest security to virtue." Another passage from the same Author.--- "The pleasure we receive from History, arises in a great measure from the same source with that we receive from Romance, it is not a bare recital of facts that gives us pleasure, they must be facts that give some agitation to the mind, by their being important, interesting, or surprising; but these events do not frequently recur in History, it is not surprising, but it is sometimes difficult to keep our attention awake." more than yours. and reason, I will give my assent it, though perhaps I may not agree to the inferences you may draw from it. and speaks of the Novels in contrast with them. vicious or shocking Characters to public view. " Tho' a good character may not have the designed effect with regard to improving the mind of the reader, a bad one will always act strongly the contrary way. The goodness of the one is easily forgotten, but the viciousness of the other cleaves to the mind of the young reader, and has its effect according to the disposition of him who receives it; if that is good, the picture of vice may carry a degree of disgust with it, which may prevent its doing him---much harm; but if it happens to be more inclined to evil, (which without being uncandid, we may, I fear, suppose more than an equal chance,) vicious images will strengthen that propensity, and however careful the Author may have been in rendering strict poetical justice, by making punishment the certain effect of criminal indulgence, the ideas of the indulgence will remain upon the mind, after those of the punishment are effaced. I am convinced that the introducing profligate characters either into Novels, or upon the Stage by way of exposing them to shame and ridicule, is a very dangerous experiment, especially for young minds; for as Swift's Directions to Servants is said to have made more bad servants than ever it corrected, by teaching them tricks, which without his wit they wou'd never have found out; so a series of crimes and follies, may give an insight into vice, which the good moral drawn from them may not prevent being put in practice." shocking stories exhibited to view in the public papers (frequently false or misrepresented,) have a bad effect upon young minds;---they familiarize their eyes to scenes of vice and folly, and sometimes to crimes of which they would be ignorant , and which are the disgrace of human nature. left to different times and manners, which we may hope will arise in due time; when poverty and distress, shall have made a general reformation both necessary and practicable:---at present our great men are fully employed, in disputing over the spoils of their unhappy and impoverished country.

Extract from the Trial or the History of Charles Horton, Esq. "If you wish in a Novel to inculcate some moral truth, to hide a jewel under so thin a veil that its brilliancy may be easily discerned, there should always be a reference to the manners and the time in which it is written; there should be the greatest probability, carried thro' the whole allegory, that your reason may not be shocked, while your imagination is pleased. If Novels were properly regulated with this design always in view, they might become really useful to society. A moral lesson otherwise dry and tedious in itself, might be communicated in a pleasing dress: as a pill has its desired effect, tho' wrapped in a gold or silver leaf. The more inviting lessons of instruction are made, certainly the better; for who are they that read Novels? ---Not men of learning, for they despise them," ( read affect to despise them ,)---not men of business, for they have other employments,---not the rich and great, for they have other amusements.---The midling rank of people then are the chief if not the only readers,"---( certainly not the only, for they are the resource of idle people of all ranks and degrees among us )---but particularly the young, the volatile, the hearts most susceptible of all kinds of impressions.---To these the chastest images should be presented, for these the purest pictures painted and selected.---Vice should be represented as it really is, attended with that trouble and confusion that should deter the wandering feet of innocence and credulity from treading in her paths; and where it is necessary to give a loose to invention, the greatest care should be taken, not to pass the line of decency. Novels written with this respect might be made subservient to the best and noblest purposes. Were I a despotic prince, I would sooner hang a man that wrote a work of direct, or indirect tendency to corrupt the morals of youth, than one who committed arobbery on the high road. We degenerate, we descend into the depravities of our nature too soon, and too easily; we want no enticements of this, or any other kind." candour, and impartiality, without considering whether they favoured my own opinions or not.---I find one more Extract, but thro' inadvertency I have omitted the name of the book from whence it is taken." "The effects of Romance, and true History upon young minds is not very different. The great and important duty of a writer is, to point out the difference between Virtue and Vice, to shew one rewarded, and the other punished; for young people pay more regard to present good, than to future recompense,---it is by degrees that they understand, and admit with reluctance, these wholsome and necessary truths. It is of the utmost consequence that these distinctions should be enforced in the strongest manner, that they may be excited to copy good, and avoid evil actions. The dullest book that ever was written with a moral view, is preferable to the most witty and elegant where these distinctions are overthrown. How dangerous and destructive is it then to suffer young people to read books where Vice is palliated and extenuated, and even recommended under other names,---where fornication is called gallantry---dissipation pleasure--- prodigality generosity---and selfishness a due regard to one's own interest. ---What punishment do such men deserve, who write with a design to gratify the vanities, the follies, the passions, the vices of youth, and furnish them with excuses for the most atrocious actions?---The poor pilferer who steals to supply his natural wants is hanged, and these pernicious members of society, are rewarded for poisoning the morals of the rising generation.---How weak, how ineffectual are human laws to answer their intended purposes; and bad at the world is, it would be much worse, if it were not for the interposition of a superior law, in cases which no human one can reach." your candour and impartiality to make an unfair use of it. opinion,---I would exclude books of bad tendency from the hands of youth, as strongly as yourself, but I would separate the grain from the chaff. Hortensius would prohibit the reading all Novels in order to exclude the bad ones.--- Euphrasia would make a separation in favour of works of Genius, taste, and morality; she would recommend such methods of preventing the mischiefs arising from novel reading, as are moderate prudent, and above all practicable .--- The objections to bad books of this species, are equally applicable to all other kinds of writing,---indecent novels, indecent plays, essays, memoirs, dialogues are equally to be exploded: but it does not follow that all these kinds of writing are to be extirpated, because some are bad.--- By the same kind of reasoning we might plead for the prohibition of all kinds of writing; for excellent and unexceptionable works of every species, may be contrasted with vicious and immoral ones. All these objections amount to no more than that bad books are bad things;---but shall we therefore prohibit reading?
