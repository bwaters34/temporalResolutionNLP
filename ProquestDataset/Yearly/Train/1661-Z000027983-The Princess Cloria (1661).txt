 The Royal Romance ; some of it being printed formerly in the worst of times; that is to say, under the Tyrannical Government of Cromwel ; when but to name or mention any of the Kings concernments, was held the greatest crime, almost could be committed against that Usurpation; and so consequently, to be punished by the High Court of Justice , with more then ordinary severity; wherein perhaps it might be thought, the Authour shewed more Fidelity then Policy; especially by those, that esteemed it best to comply with a Man, that never relented in his Revenge, or was less cruel for his Dissimulation: However, do not look for an exact History, in every particular circumstance; though perchance upon due consideration you will finde, a certain methodical coherency between the main Story, and the numerous Transactions that passed, both at home and abroad, as may render people competently satisfied; for that the tediousness of reparties, and impertinent discourses, commonly used in inventions of this kinde, are for the most part omitted, that oftentimes not onely weary Readers with expectation, but make them cast away Books before they are half read. Of the other side, you may not think, however scarce any former president, hath matched the wickedness of some in these latter dayes, that all other persons intended for Patterns of Vertue and Gallantry, did correspond fully with the relations made of their actions; neither in truth doth the present Age in the general, pretend to the exercise of such noble principles, wherein Gratitude, Fidelity, and Constancy appear countenanced, much less practised in any high measure; so that I may conclude, the Authours meaning was, rather to put persons in minde, what they ought to do, then that he was altogether ignorant what passed in reality; wherefore now and then in regard of that deficiency, was content to make use of his own invention, to supply that defect, which serves well enough, notwithstanding to the History it self, and is more agreeing with the nature of any Romance . It is to be considered also, that not seldom one name stands for one or divers parties, according as their faculties and imployments were made use of, the better to avoid confusion, by reason of several repetitions of names, which otherwise must have followed; whereby the Reader might have been subject, to have his memory put upon the Rack, to finde out the meaning of the Story; since in all Writings clearness and facility, is necessary for delight and satisfaction; but more especially where so many Ends were to be brought together, in some convenient periods. For the Style and manner of Contrivance, being mixt between Modern and Antick, although I shall leave them to the consideration and fancy of the Reader, without giving my opinion; yet I must boldly profess, the subject in my thoughts is not to be parallel'd; which no doubt gave the Writer a greater appetite to proceed; for what faults soever may appear to rigid Criticisme, nevertheless it cannot be denyed, but the Ground-work for a Romance was excellent; and the rather, since by no other way almost, could the multiplicity of strange Actions of the Times be exprest, that exceeded all belief, and went beyond every example in the doing: notwithstanding a Key of plainer and more particular intelligence in many things, hath been most earnestly solicited, however not thought altogether convenient to be printed with the rest; as well for that it might seem publickly, too much to determine State particulars and eminent Persons, as in regard also the Story is no way difficult to be understood by any, who have been but indifferently versed in the Affairs of Europe ; and for others of the more vulgar sort, a bare Romance of Love and Chivalry, such as this may be esteemed to be at the worst, will prove entertainment enough for their leasure, if the Authour have met with their appetites in his Contrivance and Expressions: besides too much explanation of Mysterious Conceptions of this nature, would have taken off something from the quaintness of the Design, and left many affected Wits, less matter for ampler Discourse, occasioned often by conjectural Disputes. But for that all Capacities meet not in the same Centre of Knowledge and Apprehension, I must inform the Reader (in regard essentially it belongs to the Body of the Story intended) that the Princess Cloria , is not onely to be taken for the Kings Daughter, but also sometimes for his National Honour; and so consequently appearing more or less in prosperity, as accidents increased and diminished; by reason of the unnatural Differences, and Rebellions were raised for so many years, in this most glorious Kingdom and Monarchy; who for that purpose bears the chief Title of the Book, and so personally (if it be minded) with some Decorum, ends every Part by it self, which hath not been observed by other Modern Writers, that scarce mention the Parties most concerned in the whole Story, as if rather accident set down their Names, then conveniency required their Actions; which is an absurdity in my minde not to be pardoned by any indifferent Judgement and Understanding. Another advertisement I must give, that notwithstanding many and divers Stories are in the Book of several natures, yet there is not one of them related, but in some sort or other appertains to the main design; not brought in (as I may say) by the head and shoulders, as is frequently used now adayes: and as they are all digested into determinable Periods within themselves, so are they of no more length, then is convenient for any moderate Communication, either of Recreation or Discourse; when as in other Romances they are oftentimes continued for five or six hours together without intermission, which to my apprehension appears ridiculous, in that people would be altogether tired, either with hearing or making such relations; and indeed almost impossible to be performed by any of what profession soever. If there be exceptions against the many Descriptions of Countreys, Places, and Triumphs, I must say, that as it hath neither perturbated or destroyed the matter, so do I not see, why that should be any defect at all; but of the contrary, a pleasant divertisement to the Reader; since nothing seems more to satisfie humane nature then varieties, either to be continually seen or considered; notwithstanding I may make some doubt, whether the hair- brain'dness of the present world, will give leasure enough to most, to dwell upon any thing at all, much less to practise Heroical Vertues with such a constant settledness as is necessary, being the chief intention of the Authour (as I conceive) in writing of this Romance , besides his affectionate duty to the Royal Family. But here perhaps some may wonder, why the perfect History might not have been as well undertaken for their Honour, as to be thus mixed with several sorts of Invention and Fancies, that rather leads peoples thoughts into a dark Labyrinth of uncertainties, then instructs their knowledges how matters passed indeed? Unto which this answer must be returned; That as the intricate Transactions of other places, hapning not seldom at the same instant, being otherwhiles onely conjectural, (wherefore point of time is not alwayes observed) though conducing for the most part to the main design, could hardly have been explained by a bare Historical Relation, that gives no liberty for inward disputations, or supposed passions to be discovered; so on the other side, Councels for the most part being given in private, much of the lustre of the whole Book would have been taken away, tending to the Readers satisfaction; and more especially seeing the common Occurrances of the World, do not arrive alwayes at a pitch high enough for example, or to stir up the appetite of the Reader, which things feigned may do under the notion of a Romance ; being it hath liberty to tell, as well what might have been, as what was performed in reality: And this certainly made most of the ancient and brave Poets, cloathe their Writings in Figures and Suppositions, whereby to set forth the Vertues usually of famous Persons, not confining themselves altogether to exact Relations, brought to their knowledge from Authentical Records; because they intended onely the exalting of Magnanimity and depressing of Vice; which I conceive, should be the principal object of every persons thoughts and desires. Nevertheless concerning the truth in the general, I must say, that as there are no remarkable Passages, that have been agitated in Christendome for some years past, but may be found sufficiently set down in this Writing, how they hapned, and with what Decorum they were performed, conducing to the Ends and Purposes intended; so in my opinion, doth not the conjectural part, made up oftentimes by invention, any way alter the nature of the actions, no more then Apparel may change the person of a man, who is not thereby transformed in essence, but in circumstance onely; and not seldom perhaps to the much more becoming and convenienter fashion: wherefore Discourses probable, and not altogether so indeed, may put people in minde of what they may say and do another time, with more advantage to themselves or imployment; especially seeing it is impossible otherwise to express inward passions and hidden thoughts, that of necessity accompany all Transactions of consequence, when as States-men now and then in Treaties judge of effects, by the very looks and countenances of such, they have occasion to deal withal in Businesses of any importance; besides, bare and simple Narratives speak little more, for the most part, then ordinary Proceedings; for that others of a more transcendent nature do not often happen, serving to any great edification; and these being now and then mixed, with communications of Arts and Policy, cannot chuse but prove as well delightful as beneficial; when as the meer repetition of things we have already industriously learned, is necessary sometimes, not onely to put us in minde of Vertues and their effects, but to continue them constantly in our thoughts and desires, whereby to render them habitual to our natures: For Stories of former Ages are no other, then certain kinde of Romances to succeeding posterity; since they have no testimony for them but mens probable opinions; seeing the Historical part almost of all Countreys is subject to be questioned; neither is it any great matter as to our profit, whether they were exactly so or no, provided Bravery be cherished, and Baseness discountenanced to our instruction; in that all things are but to teach people how to do well, and avoid the contrary; wherefore to be considered, that the Authour had a greater desire to discourse the causes of Accidents, then the truth of Actions: Nevertheless I am confident in this Romance , all Passages are related with as little partiality, as could well stand with Books of this kinde; since as it was something necessary, Matters should be mentioned a little above the ordinary way of Proceedings, to stir up the appetite of the Reader to a continuance; so cannot it be said knowingly, any thing reacheth beyond the extremity of a Wonder, whereby to be questioned either for impossible or improbable; for though twice or thrice mentions are made of Dreams and Visions, yet is it no otherwise to be understood, then what hath often hapned to particular persons formerly, who were famous or notorious for Sanctity or Wickedness, as preadmonitions from Heaven for peoples better instruction. So that now I have thus largely delivered my opinion, there rests no more behinde but an Admonition, that this Book if read at all, may be considered with some leasure and circumspection, that neither the Reader may be mistaken or the Authour too much prejudiced; since I am assured, as the Writer expects no vain-glorious approbation from any, (and less praise;) so of the other side, he will not be much troubled to be put in minde of his Faults, provided reasons be given for them; which the freer may be done, in regard his Name is not declared in these Writings, however well enough known perhaps by other circumstances: Nevertheless it is confest the Poetry is but plain, though significant to the matter; being so onely intended for the more convenient reading and apprehending the Story, without unnecessary trouble or interruption, which expressions in another strain might have procured, occasioning several interpretations, and perhaps false conjectures, which in a Romance is not proper; the Verses being commonly the main Theam to be dilated upon, or at least the conclusive Part, that should sum up the business, so that they ought to be clear and expressive; whereas other strong Lines of that kinde, (onely belonging to themselves, or to shew Poetical Fancies in meeter) may sometimes be of a nature more difficult to be understood, though often it falls out, they are not to be unriddled by any. As for the Words that have miscarried in the Printing, (which I believe are not many, though some there be in all Writings) I doubt not but they may be rectified easily in the reading, by any reasonable capacity, that will but cast over again their eyes, where they apprehend the defect to be, applying it to the sense of the rest; which in my opinion is a better way for direction, then to set down the Errours in the latter end of the Book; since few people will take the pains to compare both places together, being rather willing to let the Faults dye to their memory, then to busie themselves with trouble in anothers concernment; especially having enough already in the Story for their leasure or recreation. This being all I have to say, I bid you farewel. Of the Princess CLORIA. Coronet, to entertain her Lover, who began already to mount his golden Chariot for the dayes Triumph, when unfortunate Cassianus in the great Forrest, between the Mountain Timolius and the City of Sardis , rose from his grassie bed, under the large Canopy of a well spread Oak, where the night past he underwent an inconvenient lodging for want of better shelter; and being seated upon the root of that tree, that however had favourably contributed its best assistance towards his accommodation, with intention (according to his custom) to pay an early offering to his sorrow, whilest his Page saddled his Horse, that procured more bountifull entertainment then his master, since the time of the year had provided plentiful provision for his appetite; of a sudden his ear was saluted by a well tun'd cry of deep mouth'd Hounds, that seemed to charm the air with a delightful harmony, which consequently gave the Prince some interruption to his resolutions: but long he had not contemplated the pleasingness of the musick, with a certain strife inwardly notwithstanding, whether his complaints, or attentiveness should receive more friendly welcome in his discontented bosome, before he might see a young Gentleman, in a hasty hand-gallop to approach the place where he rested, which obliged him, as he thought, to quit the seat, whereby he might receive information concerning his travels towards Euarchus Court, his absolute ignorance in the Countrey, having made him lose his way that should have conducted him to some Town, that might have instructed his knowledge in the journey. But the youth beholding a stranger of a seeming quality in that posture, not onely stopped the speedy course of his appearing well-breath'd horse; but when he came at a nearer distance, in a gentle trot advanced towards him, with intention to offer all courteous civilities, since he perceived the open heavens had onely given him welcome, and to that purpose saluted him with this language. Sir, said he, it hath been still the custome of Lydia , to comply with the necessity of strangers, of what quality soever; wherefore I should commit a sin against the rules of Hospitality, in passing by your person with a regardless neglect, to what you might stand in need of, finding you here at this time of the day; and the rather, for that in outward appearance your condition may merit the highest respect; to which purpose, I have resolved to leave my sport, whereby the more conveniently to conduct you to the Kings presence, if your pleasure shall condescend to the intention, being now present in this exercise of hunting, who would no doubt, correct my ill-natur'd rudeness, if I should commit so great a fault, as not to let his Majesty know, that the Woods had entertained such a guest without his welcome and privity. And although I am but a Gentleman that waits upon the King in his Chamber, I may have yet the honour to attend you to him, where I dare presume, your reception will in some sort be answerable to your worth, though my quality merit not your esteem. Cassianus glad that he had hapned upon a conductor, that could so easily present him to the King; and that his Majesties recreation gave him so speedy and convenient an occasion, after he had given him thanks for the offer, told him, that as his ignorance in the passage, had made him stand in need of the least assistance, to winde him out of the intricate labyrinth of these Woods, that had imployed his thoughts for the night past, since he could neither be safe from wilde Beasts or Robbers, according to his doubtful apprehension; but was more fortunate to have such a worthy guide, to accompany him to the uttermost end of his journey, for that probably his arrival at the Court, would be the period of his business: And therefore he should, as he said, extreamly oblige a wandering Pilgrime in the office. But because the King was so passionately imployed (as he was informed) for the present, with his fortunate sport, Cassianus supposed it scarce manners to give it interruption by his addresses; so that he walked up and down a green walk, demanding such questions as were necessary for his information, until the youth also modestly desired some satisfaction concerning his adventures; which was the easier granted, since the relation not onely suited well enough with the Princes intention of courtesie and affibility, but with the conveniency of the time: when they were both seated upon the same root that had been Cassianus uneasie pillow, he gave him this instruction of his fortunes, with few or no circumstances but what many deep sighs contrived. My Father, said he, Prince of Iberia , was in his youthful years inflamed with the report of the excellent beauty of Elizana your Kings sister, whose fame could not be circumscribed within the limits of Lydia , which made him, after a long solicitation by Letters, take a journey in person to the Court, to tender the affection and respects due to a Lady of so eminent birth and vertues; notwithstanding he seemed not to bring with him, Dignity, Titles, and Riches, sufficient to deserve so glorious a match: This, I must tell you, rendred the Queen her Mother, then living, an absolute enemy to his courtships, supposing her Daughter to be undervalued by the choice: nevertheless, the state of Lydia finding not onely a certain concurrency in their Loves, but an agreement of their Religions, for that both Countries had left the obedience of Delphos , perswaded the King her Father to the alliance, supposing all other defects would be buried by those unities; so that in a short time the Marriage was solemnized with most magnificent Ceremonies, though in the interim the triumphs were something obscured, by the sudden death of the Prince her elder Brother, whose disposition in his life, gave such opinions of his future greatness, that the world began already to tremble with the very apprehension of his fate; yet the accident advanced my Mother a step nearer to the Crown, since there was none left of the Race to inherit, but my Uncle Euarchus and her self; and this by consequence made my Father in the apprehension of Asia , a far greater Prince then his own Fortunes could pretend unto; insomuch as returning into his native Countrey, with his illustrious Bride, what honour could be imagined was cast upon him by the admiring people, which honours raised excessively his aspiring thoughts, notwithstanding many of his own rank began to envy his prosperity, especially one Tygranes Duke of Colchis , who ever esteemed himself in possession, the more powerful Prince: In fine, the Kingdom of Mesopotamia revolting at the same time from the jurisdiction of Artaxis , King of Armenia , my Father was earnestly solicited to take upon him the Crown, since he was onely able by his power and alliance, as the people pretended, to defend their proceedings against their tyrannical Lord, who had usurped too great a Prerogative, both over their Laws and Consciences. The offer in a manner was no sooner proposed to the ambition of his youth, being tickled with the desire of bearing the name of a King, though many had refused the same tender, but he accepted of the Government, promising his protection, as the Subjects did their fidelity, and in this hopeful agreement, he was with all Ceremony and State, dignified with the Diadem in the regal City of the Kingdom: But the possession, however it brought with it honour and dignity, it lessened not his care or trouble, since the glory was to be maintained now it was purchased. This enterprise gave as earnest warning to Artaxis , to be diligent in providing Forces to suppress the example, and punish the esteemed Rebellion, that else might prove a leading card as he thought, to the quiet state of the rest of his Dominions, that began already to waver in their obedience, as it did desire in my Father to maintain what he had got, though it were with never so great a violence and hazard: In the first place Artaxis dispatches Ambassadours, not onely to all his friends in other Countries, laying before them the dangerous consequences of such a Revolt; but also sent Messengers to his own Subjects, possessing them with the fear of the Rebells insolency, however his endeavours so little prospered for the present to his advantage, the first sort being too far off to give him speedy assistance, as the other too disobedient to lend him much aid, that his General was constrained to take the Field with a very small number; onely the Army within some few weeks became increased by an addition of Tygranes Forces, whose envy to my Father, notwithstanding the near kindred between them, had rendered him a most mortal Enemy. But Artaxis Generall finding it was full time to dispute the right by the Sword, though upon any disadvantage, since all protraction did but increase the peoples suspicion of the Kings disability, that was not able to chastise one Subject who seemed to rebell against his Majesty and Power, with as much courage as could proceed from desperate hopes, marched against the City where my Father continued his Court, guarded with Souldiers sufficient to have besieged Artaxis whole Army, if their hearts and affections had been answerable to their number and accomodation; and in this posture the General not onely sets upon the wall (the Garrison not expecting the boldness of the attempt) but in a short time became Master, both of the Gates and Streets, to the confused amazement of all the Inhabitants, who seemed neither to have will nor power to resist; so that the strange news scarce giving conveniency and time to my Father with his whole Family, to flye from the danger; he had not opportunity to draw his Sword in the defence of himself and Crown, but through private and obscure Woods, was constrained to convey his Wife and Children, untill he arrived under the protection of a Common-weale, that at the beginning of the design had lent a willing and considerable aid to the action. Artaxis hearing of this extraordinary success, not onely beyond his expectation, but in a manner above all belief, caused publick Sacrifices to be made to the Gods through the chief Temples, that he might not seem in the peoples apprehensions, to be ungrateful for such large benefits; and to increase the more his Subjects opinions, that the very Heavens intented to fight for his right, since he made Religion the chief cause of the War, he gave it out the Victory was no less then miraculous since his General, as 'twas said, had been instructed in the assault by a Divine Revelation, which had made him venture upon so desperate an enterprise; but however, the King was thought by many over superstitious, yet the General and Tygranes omitted no industery to render our house miserable; the first continuing in those parts after the Battle, with half the Army, to suppress the last sparkles of common Rebellion, as the other led the rest into Iberia my fathers Countrey, to make himself master of that Territory bestowed upon him by Artaxis , in recompence of his service done against our Family; in which employment they both thought, and strived to exceed each other in cruelty, not onely in undoing our present prosperity, but also in rooting out our future remembrance; the one possessing himself of all the subsistence that should have nourished my Father, his Wife, and Children, as the other bereaved him of his honour that would have made him and his posterity capable of better fortunes; and in this manner were we all turned a begging, as I may say, into the wide world, to converse with nothing but want, disgrace, and trouble; whilst our enemies enjoyed our Towns, Castles, Titles, and Countrey; which continued my poor father so discontent for some years, having nothing to live upon but what he received from the bounty of his Father in law, until at last not being able longer to endure the sharp frownes of his spiteful fates, accompanied with the cruel usage of his malicious enemies, he willingly paid nature her due, and changed his inconstant habitation here, for a perpetual one hereafter; leaving his Wife and all his Children, not onely to bewail his death, though they esteemed him much more happy then themselves, but to provide anew against the storms of other miseries, since we wanted a director to steer our courses: however, my Mother being endued with admirable vertues and courage, endeavoured by the small, though loving subsistence she received from her friends, not onely to bring up her many children, with all the exquisite breeding she could devise, but by the affability of her natural behaviour and conversation, strived to gain the love and compassion of all Asia ; insomuch, as for the first she set us in the world at convenient years not to be a shame to our well- descended Family; and for the latter, she so compassed her design, that no heart in a manner but wisht her prosperity. In this posture we remained until she sent me to be a Suiter to a rich Heir, with hopes again to raise our House to some eminency, by obtaining the possession of another principality that rightly belonged to the young Lady; but Tygranes , as if he had absolutely sworn himself an enemy to all that could do good to our Family, not onely became also a pretender to the same Match, but prevailed so far with Artaxis , before the Marriage could be obtained, that he sent a powerful Army to besiege the Lady in her Castle, and so by force possessed themselves both of her person and patrimony, leaving me again to my desperate fortunes, not having any force to defend her Rights, or maintain my own pretensions; that ever since hath continued me a wanderer through most of the Princes Courts of Asia to seek relief; which at last hath brought me into the quiet haven of Euarchus Countrey, with the same intention to demand his willing assistance; my hopes being more increased by reason of the general fame of the peaceable state of his rich and powerful Dominions. But scarce was he come to the end of this discourse, when the King himself alighting to take a fresh Horse, near the place where they were, whereby the better to pursue his begun sport, Cassianus had opportunity to present himself to his view and consideration; the company in the mean time, with a certain amazed haste, making way for his approach, since the adventure of a stranger in such a posture, seemed to invite all their expectations: wherefore when he came at so convenient a distance, that his words might easily be heard, supporting his body by a small Ebony Lance he carried in his hand, with a confident modesty delivered these words. Mighty King, said he, although your Emperial Diadems seems to flourish with Olive Branches, whilest the ambition of other Princes make but the Prerogative of their Crowns nourish the lusts of their own tyranny, and by that means, instead of being protectors of their people, deliver them up to slaughter and oppression; yet certainly the Gods have not onely placed you upon a Throne, to be happy your self by a lasting peace, but to render others satisfied by your Power and Justice, especially, when the Heavens are dishonoured by their injuries; and with that wept, which for the present stopt the progress of his discourse; but being encouraged to further expressions by the Kings pitty, however his language seemed strange to his ears, as his person did to his eyes; when he had dryed his fair face with a handkercher, he uttered this language. Great Sir, said he, as I shall not need to trouble you with many particulars concerning the unhappy passages of my Fathers Fortunes, since the story I suppose hath been sufficiently presented to your ears by common fame, if not by more exact relations; so must I at this time, not onely give you an account of my own actions, being encouraged thereunto by your Majesties appearing favours, but also do presume upon redresses according to your power and goodness: to this purpose be pleased to know, that my name is Cassianus your most unfortunate Nephew, being driven from my rights and possessions in the fruitful Countrey of Iberia , by the tyrannical oppressions of Artaxis King of Armenia , which hath caused me since my years gave me ability, both to understand and prosecute my own affairs, to travel through most part of Asia , to seek assistance amongst other Princes of my own rank; but finding them for the most part so much incumbred, by reason of their troublesome occasions, or I may say not willing to expose themselves to any danger or hazard concerning anothers benefit, though my injuries lye before them as warning examples for their own conditions, I could obtain from their courtesies no hopes of any assistance, though many complements were used of good will and affection, unless I could procure other greater Monarchs to joyn with them in the quarrel. These answers quickly carried my endeavours to the Court of Syria , where at present reigns Orsames that mighty King, who after I had also presented unto him my desires, he seemed to wonder why I should make my addresses to himself or any other Prince in Asia , when you, notwithstanding your power, peace, and tranquility, appeared to be so far from giving me any aid in my necessities, that you appeared not at all sensible of my sufferings; however he told me, that if I could yet procure the breach of that amity between you and Artaxis , whereby some considerable supplies might come from Lydia , abounding as he said rather in luxuries then in activity, he would presently declare War against the Armenian King, by which means I might come again into the possession of my lost rights. These intimations I bring from one powerful Monarch to another, and such supplications my own necessities require me to make, the rather for that not onely your Royal Blood, hath honoured my birth from my most Illustrious Mother, but the same worship of the Gods are exercised both in Lydia and Iberia , which being said, he again rested silent with tears in his eyes. Euarchus , after he had fully understood with a pensive attentiveness his Nephews request, and entertained him with those complements, and that welcome his condition and alliance merited, he onely for the present told him, that as a matter of this consequence required a judicious consideration, so he might be confident of his love and affection; and withal invited him for diversion, to be a partaker of of the Lydian pastime, agreeing as he said, with his youth and courage, which gave their thoughts for some hours sufficient imployment. However, the King being in his own nature extreamly solicitous, though personally he followed the sport, according to his custom, with the formost; yet having received, contrary to his expectation, a subject of such consideration, all the day did labour in his minde a resolution; one while reflecting upon the quiet and prosperity of his own Kingdoms; and then again, weighed the pretended injuries of his near kinsman, professing the same worship of the Gods, besides the glorious offer of Orsames , which as he thought, did in a manner compell him to be active: but the night coming on so fast, the King was not onely forced to put off his unprofitable medication until a more convenient season, but to command the retreat from that delightful exercise to be founded: Wherefore taking the youth by the hand, with whose person and behaviour he seemed to be already in love, he placed him by him in his Coach, and so entertained the time with discourses of his fortunes, untill they arrived at the Palace, which for its singular beauty deserves a particular description. The house was seated upon the banks of the river Pactoleus , by whose refreshing streams, the delightful gardens placed of all sides, seemed to flourish with an exact greenness: the portal was formed of white marble, with columns architrane freeze and cornish; on the top it was crowned with a Cornucopia incompassing an Azure Globe, supported by little Cupids with gilded wings; under which they passed through a square Court, set round about with excellent Statues of brass in Niches: the structure it self was of Oriental Gravet stone , so interlaced with Ionick and Corinthian pillars of divers colours, that as it gave the eye a most delectable object, so it rendered the edifice much more sumptuous; at the upper end was a large Tarase elevated six steps; upon the stairs stood Hiacinthia the Queen, to give her husband meeting accompanied by the new stranger. As soon as Cassianus beheld that beauty mixt with a kinde of sweet Majesty, that both aw'd and pleas'd at the same time, he addrest himself to her presence, like one that intended onely to be Euarchus suppliant; however the Queen that was ignorant in nothing but pride, with a gentle smile, which notwithstanding for the more grace, put a vermillion blush in her fair cheeks, gave him a gracious welcome into Lydia: but turning his eye on one side, he was suddenly struck with such an amazement, to behold the Princess Cloria the Kings Daughter, that he had strife enough with his own passions to performe the rest of those reverences due to her Mothers dignity, since his thoughts imagined to look upon an earthly Deity. She was cloathed in light Taffety for the commodity of the season, through which her dainty limbs seemed to appear in admirable proportion, leaving nothing to be hid that hindered the true knowledge of her excellent shape, but yet covered those beauties which are encreased onely by opinion and desire. She was crowned with a chaplet of white and red Roses, not yet fully blown; her hair was combed to the full length, and breaded with ribbons of the same colour, as if art were ambitious of natures liberty; her sleeves were open, and lined with needle-work of the story of Diana and Acteon , wherein the Nymphs with a confused bashfulness, seemed to hide themselves amongst the rushes; and all the rest of her scarce any apparel was so becomming, that either she made it so by her perfections, or her perfections could not be fitted by better inventions. But the Queen quickly removed Cassianus from that object, that began already so strongly to charm all his senses; for taking him by the hand, she walked with him many turns about the Tarase, whilest in the mean time he discoursed to her his adventures; however now and then he could not chuse but disturb his story, by casting his looks where the Princes stood, though at last she suddenly shot from his sight like a bright star in the firmament, which made him seek her with his eyes to as little purpose: After some time that the Queen seemed sufficiently to have recreated her self in the aire, she was informed by an Officer of the Court, that the King expected her company in the Parlor. The room was onely divided from the Gardens by a partition of bright glass, interwoven with certain silver terms that afforded a most delectable prospect upon the Orenge-trees , and beautiful fountains: not long after their entrance (in which space the King instructed Cassianus in the masters of his principal pictures) supper was served upon a marble Table without covering, for the more coolness, near which was a lake of clear water, where Neptune sate in Majesty with his Tritons , that by the artificial turning of a cock, sounded their trumpets composed of shels at the entrance of every course. Cassianus was placed by fortune right over against Cloria , which not onely gave him sufficient opportunity to contemplate her beauty, but the contemplation it self afforded him such abundant matter to work upon, that he fed more his soul by that delight, then his appetite with the delicious dishes of the Kings Table; and certainly had been absolutely lost in that ravishing lethargy, if Euarchus had not often wakened him by divers questions concerning his journey, and the rest of his adventures in Armenia , to make a civil, though scarce a satisfactory answer; but however, as if he esteemed his eyes bound to the duty, he cast his look again that way, which occasioned still more distractedness in his reply; so that the King believing his Nephews travels required a necessary rest, not onely presently rose from the Table, but commanded the chief Nobility of the Court, to conduct the Prince to his lodging, where he had privacy enough to fulfil the desires of his curious fancies, which entertained him all the night with little or no sleep, until the Kings musick the next morning saluted him with this Ditty.  Fair Prince, your youthfull presence here is like the Summer of the year, Welcomm'd by hearts of every sort, to Great Euarchus Royal Court. May blessed visions sent by Jove , wait on your slumbers from above, Vntill bright Phoebus with his beams, in season wake you from your dreams; And then may objects of delight, in every place content your sight: Let fortune so observe your way, that you command whilst others pray; And aged time prolong your life, beyond the Sisters fatal knife, Vntill you willingly resign your soul to be install'd divine. Then let old Sardis for it's glory raise up a Homer to your story; So as you are a Summer here, a Harvest may attend you there. But however, after some weeks, Cassianus seemed to kindle in his youthful bosome new flames, with those small sparkles he had received from Cloria's beauty, which often separated him from the rest of the company, that made some believe he was too much discontented with the Kings protraction; yet Euarchus mindfull both of his affection to his nephew, and the prosperity of his own Countries, finding rumours began too frequently to flye about the Court, by reason of the violent desires of many to be imployed in the Warres; one day called unto him an ancient Officer of his Kingdome, on whose wisdome and fidelity he most relyed in all his weighty Affairs, and leading him into the Garden, where he might both enjoy privacy and recreation, after some necessary circumstances which seemed to usher in his discourse, he used these words: Polinex said he, (for so he was called) as I have ever most trusted your knowledge and experience, so have I never been less confident of your loyalty and affection, since neither as yet hath deceived my expectation when I had most occasion to use your service, which deservedly renders you a worthy Councellour, as I desire to be a good Prince that cannot I hope, but produce consequents towards the happy Government of my Kingdomes; however at the present, your faithfull advice is more requisite then ever, since expedition and danger cannot be separated from those undertakings I am violently prest unto. You know that lately there is come to my Court my Nephew Cassianus , a Prince whose person and merits deserve at least a kinsmans consideration, much more his injuries a Kings Justice; the one bids me cherish him with my affection, the other invites me to assist him with my power: however the strict eye of sworn amity between Princes, perswades me to be circumspect in the breach, notwithstanding the head-long precipitation of many of my chief Councellours who solicite me to a War; wherefore that I may avoid the hazard of a general disquiet, since I finde my people begin to be sick of their own tranquility, or make Warre upon such grounds that may conserve inviolably my faith with the King of Armenia , which the Gods cannot else prosper; I require your opinion, Polinex, after he had with an humble gravity heard out the Kings discourse, and taken some time to consider the weightiness of the Councel, in a distinct manner returned this answer, wherein he used no more eloquence then was necessary for the importancy of so great a business, though nature and art had furnished him with parts excellent in that kinde. Sir, said he, as benefits had from Princes are past requital in a Subject, even like graces received from the Gods, by which we are enabled to do something; so I the unusefullest of your servants, though most honoured by your goodness, may by the reflection of your lustre merit the office of a Counsellour, because you have been pleased to make me one; but if I should in the least thought prove a Traytor to your glory (as a haynous offence that ought to bury the remembrance of any good past) I did not onely deserve to be divested of all your former benefits, but to be condemned to the worst of punishments, since your transcendent favours have rendered my defects considerable: however, if my weaknesse chance to erre, and not my will, that mercy which makes you resemble the Gods I must challenge; and thus according to your Royall Command, I freely deliver my opinion. A War wisely undertaken, ought chiefly to be accompanied with two considerations; the right of the Quarrel, and the power of the Quarreller; the first makes a man a just enemy, the second a prevailing Conqueror; without either of which, certainly a Prince cannot be fortunate, since he must be an oppressor of a loser; and why your Majesty should not give your self the liberty of such a resolution, notwithstanding the pressing necessity of your Kinsman, I know no reason, since your Kingdoms are more to be valued then his Countrey, and your honour then his benefit, though I will not at all dispute the worth of his person. Besides, you are to consider with what Prince you are to have the difference, not onely a neighbour that never yet injur'd your right in any thing, but of the contrary one with whom you have sworn a perfect friendship, which is an alliance the heavens have made to be preferred far before humane kindred, since the one is seal'd but with flesh and blood, as the other hath imprinted its character in the skies. Again, for you to proclaim a War of Blood, before you have demanded peace by a friendly disputation, were to stile you cruel, since no violence proceeding from the greatest ambition ever practised such an injustice, to put in execution a force to obtain that which perhaps the enemy you intend to make, will easily grant; and as it will be esteemed more charity and goodness, to perswade then compel, although the cause be absolutely just; so if the contrary, you are a double injurer, one way in beginning an unlawful contention without provocation; the other, in breaking those tyes that ought to oblige all Princes to an inviolable observation. Also, you may be pleased to consider your hazard, since your own safety is first to be valued, whether in honour or prosperity; for although your Kingdomes do in some sort equall Armenia in multitude of men and warlike provision, yet in respect of the long neglect of Martial Discipline, they are rendred as it is to be feared, wholly incapable of a present expedition; and your treasure, notwithstanding it be sufficient to maintain the expence of your peaceable Government; yet, it will be found no way able to undergo the charge of a powerful Army; so that whether your people, so unaccustomed to oppression, and impatient of subjection, from whose purses must come the supply, (inconstant by nature to their own desires, witness their promises lately upon the same occasion) will be brought blindefold to contribute, without being privy to every secret intention, in my judgement is scarce a question, and how dangerously destructive that would prove to any enterprize, when the multitude must be made acquainted with each stratagem of State, I leave your Majesty to judge. Therefore my opinion is, that until you can provide a store out of your own Revenue, without depending altogether upon the uncertainty of your Subjects bounty, no warlike undertaking can prove glorious or beneficial, but of the contrary dangerous and unprofitable: So that all you can do for the present, is to send an Ambassadour with reasons to perswade, and not a Herald with threatnings to denounce, which in all probability will not onely give satisfaction to your distressed Kinsman, but win time till you be better provided. This advice extreamly pleased the King, who aimed rather at present content then future glory, although his courage might pretend to the greatest honour, not onely for that it took away the occasion of exhausting his treasure, but was also as he thought, a principal means still to maintain his State in tranquility, and his Government without perturbation. Wherefore parting from Polinex with such a smile as sufficiently perswaded him he was well satisfied with his Counsel, sent presently for Prince Cassianus , to whom he communicated his determination, which was forthwith to employ an Ambassadour, to demand reason of the King of Armenia . But however this determination did not much discontent Cassianus, because it gave him opportunity to remain in Lydia , whereby he might the better prosecute his secret affections to the fair Princess Cloria ; yet those that violently desired employment in the Wars, though it were bought with never so much prejudice to the Kings Affairs, extreamly mutined against Polinex his Counsel, amongst which number there was a Nobleman called Dimogoras , one whose birth exceeded his wit, as his ambition did his courage; and his fortune not answering either, made him much more violent then the rest, since he supposed if he lost this opportunity for action, Euarchus resolutions for peace would become more established; besides, he hated the Kings person, because he had formerly received many Court affronts, procured by his own factious spirit; wherefore he took occasion by this means, not onely to inform the State of Syria, that Euarchus could not be drawn to make War against any of the kindred of Soroasters King of Egypt , upon what pretence soever, but secretly possest all manner of people either with the Kings want of courage or good nature, since coldly he was content as he said, to let sleep the oppressions of his injur'd Nephew without revenge: but principally he blamed the pernitious Councels, as he termed them, of Polinex , who strived to rock Euarchus minde into a lethargy of repose, that he alone might rule the state with more conveniency towards the particular inriching of his own Family; and the rather were these factious speeches dangerous, because the King was resolved, out of the rules of hospitality, not to question any thing that was said in Cassianus behalf; which within a short space began insensibly to penetrate the hearts of the vulger; Dimogoras having a principal interest in their affections, not onely because they knew he was not esteemed at Court, but for that commonly men of least eminent worth have the fortune to gain the opinion of the multitude, since they hate vertue, because they are resolved not to follow it. However, Euarchus to remedy (the sweetest way he could) these growing inconveniencies which yet appeared not in full prospect, to divert his Nephews thoughts from entertaining discontented Councels, proclaimed a general hunting of the wilde Boar, at which time Cassianus being summoned by the early morning to the delightful sport, he found the King ready prepared for the Forrest, upon the Plain before the Palace Gate, where Hyacinthia the Queen, not so much pleased with the chace as to accompany her Husband, soon repaired with the choicest Ladies, whose dress resembled the chaste Goddess Diana in the like exercise, onely upon her head she wore a Hat, the more commodiously to cover the fair tresses of her hair, that were imbraced with rows of rich pearl, since no meaner tyes were fit to adorn so bountiful a treasure, and in this posture they issued out, animated by the importunate solicitation of the Huntsmen, who seemed over-ambitious to be in their elements; at leastwise so interpreted by love- sick Cassianus , who thought all the preparation nothing, since Cloria , the onely Star of his desires was not to be of the Society, her Mother judging her by much too young for the pastime. No sooner was the unhandsome Beast dislodged from his darksome habitation, when every person well hors'd, endeavoured to shew his own skill, and his coursers vigour, whilst the solitary Woods resounded with the chearful noise of divers Horns that seemed to encourage the Hunters; onely the women complained that nature had not ordained them proper for the sport, since their attire would not permit them to pass through the thickest Copses. But Cassianus, who was willing otherwise to be imployed, thinking that confusion spoke not to his imagination the soft language of a Lover, retired presently from the crowd, though he suffered his horse in a manner to be his own director, untill the permittance within a short space, brought them both into an ample Plain; notwithstanding so invironed with low wood, that the eye could scarce discern any other passage then what Cassianus had found, where also a gentle, though plentiful seeming Spring, had made a pretty Brook, if the hot season had not tyrannically supprest part of its current; yet it appeared beautiful in that littleness, because it contributed to the flourishing greenness of the place, and that beauty invited Cassianus to enjoy the delight thereof: Wherefore alighting from his horse, and turning his bridle over his head, to give him the more liberty to please himself in that luxurious pasturage, whilst he meant onely to feed upon the sadness of his own thoughts, sate down upon the Bank of the River, into which he let fall many of his tears, as if he intended to supply the accidental defect thereof; but when the fountain of his eyes had paid a sufficient tribute to his grief, and that his sighs had awakened him to some expression, he discoursed to himself in this manner, since the ignorant Woods seemed no way capable of his complaints, but in returning a doleful eccho to augment his sufferings. Unfortunate Cassianus , said he, whose youth hath scarce numbred years to make thee a perfect subject of misery, and yet thy crosses render thee the onely unhappy spectacle of all Asia , for that almost at one instant thou didst not alone lose thy dear father and fruitful Countrey, but art forc'd to become a wandring Pilgrime through the whole World without compassion, since thy sufferings do not afford thee a competent pitty amongst other Princes of thy own rank, much less a necessary assistance from those which are above thee in dignity: And last of all, when thou hadst thought to have attained some harbour of consolation under the protection of thy powerful Uncle, abounding in all plenty and tranquility, thou art again cast upon a new rock that threatens thy ruine, in that thou neither darest own that love which destroyes thy rest, nor hast hope to quench the flames of thy desire to give thy self ease; the one being too violent to be supprest, as the other too impossible to be obtained: For canst thou think fond Cassianus , said he, that her innocency may be attempted without the consent of her parents, or that her parents can be won to so unprofitable a match; and yet sweet Cloria , consider rather the vertue of an entire affection, that is, the onely tye required by the just heavens, then the sole commodity of Empires, to make thee happy in a choice; but alas, alas, I foolishly bestow my vain breath upon the abundant air, and my sorrowful tears to increase the plentiful springs, since neither have power to contribute to my redress, when it must be action if any thing that will afford satisfaction; and yet with what face thou canst present thy widow love to so excellent a purity, the Gods must onely instruct, if they intend at all to be propitious in thy affairs. But as he was again taking a new carreer of passion, he might see of a sudden the hunted Boar foaming with his own choler, rush out of the thickest woods, and not long after a youth of manly proportion, who followed the chace with a bold eagerness; however by his different attire, he was easily to be discerned to be none of the morning company: this prospect invited Cassianus , with some curiosity, to attend the success of the encounter, since the valiant Beast finding himself to be pursued by so exact a courage, quickly turned with fury upon the young man, which represented to his expectation a spectacle not more dangerous then pleasant, for honour and cruelty seemed to contend for Victory. The conflict endured a long time, the one striving by a rude violence to avoid destruction, as the other with a handsome activity sought to become victorious, till at last both being heated with the fight, began to approach at a nearer distance, since the youths Spear broken in the encounter, afforded him no other convenience to offend his enemy, which however he managed with so much advantage, that the Boar having received many wounds, was forced with open mouth to attempt his prosecuter as his last refuge, though to his ruine: for the stranger taking advantage of his unskillful rage, thrust his short weapon with his whole hand into the Boars throat, with so fortunate an issue, that the point appeared in his neck behinde, though the stroak deprived him not presently of life, but seemed rather to give him new courage, however less power; for turning afresh with a new fury upon the disarmed youth, he had no defence to prevent the danger, but to traverse his ground, until the Beast's much loss of blood, by reason of his enraged agitation, made him become the trophey of his honour, who quickly separated his head from his body, with a short Sword he wore by his side, as the testimony of a perfect Conquest, and then placed it upon a little hill, supported with the broken Lance, whilst he himself approached the River to wash his hands that were bespotted in the fight with the Boars blood. Cassianus having beheld this combat with a most earnest delight, if any thing could be termed delight that his sad imagination look'd upon, thought he could do no less then congratulate so pleasing a Tragedy, and to that purpose rose from his seat with the intention, which the stranger beholding, though until then he was not advertised of any bodies presence in that solitary habitation, as quickly prepared himself to give him the meeting; and the rather for that he appeared a person of some quality, untill both their designes at last brought them to so near a distance, that the youth was soon known to Cassianus to be his onely friend Eumenes, a Gentleman bred up in his Mothers Court, whose Father had accompanied her out of Lydia into Iberia , when she was first married: as the Gods can tell with what inward content these two companions performed their first imbracement, wherein they seemed to be eternally united in fortune, not to be separated again by any disaster, so was it not very long before their desires of knowing each others adventures separated their persons again: wherefore seating themselves by that River side that had entertained them both, Eumenes was perswaded to begin the first story, in order to the time it was acted, which he performed after this manner; though he kept still his eye, as a watchful sentinel over his friends person. Cassianus , said he, you know that your vertuous mother, for my more absolute breeding, sent me into Cyprus to be trained in the Wars under the command of that excellent Duke, finding my disposition and years suited well enough with the profession, which for the time separated you and me, to both our griefs, though the intention was honourable; and being so, I had reason to dispose my thoughts towards the accomplishment of some perfection in that noble exercise; where remaining two years, as you may have heard, fortune so favoured my actions, that in many attempts upon the enemy, I gained a convenient reputation; however my ambition raised my imagination to higher fancies, insomuch as I not onely thought upon a Mistriss unto whom I might consecrate all my Military endeavours, as an essential part (as I thought) of a Souldier, but was resolved to flye in no lower a place then in that region where the Dukes onely daughter moved, the fair Eretheria , whose perfections (I conceived) were alone fit to captivate my intentions; and to that purpose, upon all occasions, I strived to let the world see my aims, which soon procured me a multitude of rivals of no mean quality, who thought it scarce justice to let a stranger carry away the glory of Cyprus: but not long after, by the violent solicitation of the youthful Courtiers, a Turnament was proclaimed, upon the birth-day of the Princess; where every one hoped to shew that valour, that might render him worthy of the high prize ordained for the Conquerour. The time being come for the Trial, the bright Star, Eretheria , was placed upon a Throne, like a Deity sent by the heavens to captivate all mortal hearts; which sight certainly enflamed every courage with a new spirit, though we all beheld her as a Comet threatning destruction to many, since but one pretender could hope to live by her favour: but the sounding of the Trumpets quickly wakened us out of this admiring slumber, to be more gloriously active, which (in truth) performed such deeds of all sides, that Eretheria seemed not to be dishonoured in the encounters; however a young Nobleman of Cyprus , passionately also taken with her beauty, seemed all the day to carry away the chief victory, which procured him, as you may imagine, a competent number of emulators, if not enviers; amongst which company, I must confess, I wisht him not better then the rest, since I supposed my self as deeply interessed in the quarrel: Wherefore choosing one of the biggest Spears I could finde, though my heart was a great deal bigger with the desire of his disgrace, I sought him out in the crowd, with so happy a success to my thoughts, that I quickly unhors'd him in the midd'st of his prevailing glory, to the no small amazement of the people, who esteemed him almost immortal; and therefore crown'd the action with so loud a shout, that the heavens seemed to ring for a long time with the noise; which to my infinite content possessed me intirely with the rich prize from the fair hands of Eretheria ; besides a multitude of other honours belonging to the Ceremony. But however I seemed to be carried triumphantly in a Chariot, beyond the reach of any envy, yet my rival forgot not the effects of revenge; since he esteemed himself not onely to suffer in honour, but in love; and the rather, for that he imagined from that instant Eretheria turned in some sort her looks more graciously towards me then formerly she had done, by reason of the fortunate success I had in the Tilting. Wherefore one day meeting me half arm'd in the Park belonging to the Court, he set upon me with all violence, both with his language and weapon, insomuch as I had enough to do to avoid the one, as I did not at all dispute with him in the other, since my best faculties had imployment sufficient to defend my person against so spightful a valour; though the Gods favouring my innocency more then his injustice, at last gave me an unfortunate Victory, since not onely his life was the price of my conquest, but the fear of a dishonourable death compelled me quickly to quit Cyprus , to avoid the prosecution of his powerful friends; where however I have left my heart a prisoner, to be condemned or saved by the mercy of beauteous Eretheria ; which occasioned also the slaughter of this beast before your eyes: for conceiving my own Countrey my best place of refuge until this storm might be blown over, I retired hither with two servants onely, who are not yet arrived; and travelling the Woods, having lost my way, I accidentally met with this hunted Boar that set upon me with some fury, which forced me at first to the encounter, else I should have scarce been so uncharitable as to have destroyed the sport: these accidents, dear Cassianus , said he, have been the reasons that brought me into Lydia , onely happy now in our meeting. Cassianus having both kept silence, and observed attentiveness in his friends discourse, as it were congratulating his story and welcome, by four or five sad sighs, being compelled by his importunity, to make relation of his own fortunes also, without many circumstances, began in this manner: After my unfortunate Father, as you well know, said he, had paid the debt of his rash attempt (in taking upon him the Crown of Mesopotamia , contrary to the good liking of Artaxis great King of Armenia ) with his death, and loss of his fruitful Countrey of Iberia , my infancy, as you were a witness, was carefully cherished by my mothers natural goodness; insomuch as she thought not my years capable of your imployments in Cyprus , although both my desires and wishes accompanied you in your journey; however, after your departure she designed me to another War, though by much more gentle yet not so honourable, which was to court the love of a rich Heir, not far off the place where we lived, by whose power she conceived (if I could compass the Marriage) I might be again rendered capable to contend with Tygranes Duke of Colches, who enjoyed the possession of my native Countrey, by the donation of Artaxis , in retribution of that service he did him in the prosecution of my Father; but no sooner had a fitting preparation elevated my thoughts to the enterprise, but the King became advertised of the intention, so that arriving at her Castle, I was encountred by my double rival the Duke, contrary to my expectation, who came there also with the same design, though fortified as he thought with far greater pretensions, since he brought with him the strong recommendation, of his mighty friend the King of Armenia ; but the Gods know, with what labour I supprest the passion of my soul, that it might not burst out into a rude, and inhospitable contention, to destroy absolutely my intended proceedings, so that both of us addressing our selves to the Ladies presence, with a quiet civility, we were received in outward shew with equal courtesie, which continued us for some weeks in her Palace, onely seeking occasions how we might best present our affections, with most conveniency to deceive each other: But the Duke, whether impatient of his long attendance, or suspecting I received private favours to his prejudice; of a sudden one morning before any one was up in the house, took his leave both of his Chamber and the Castle, by which means he left me in full possession of my desires, since I thought no obstacle now was able to hinder my proceedings of a prosperous issue; in which paradise of felicity I continued for many dayes, solacing my self with delightful fancies, whilest in the mean time the Duke was preparing a snare not onely to captivate the Lady, but to entrap me; for not long after he marched in person with a powerful Army to besiege the Castle where we both remained; which news made me dispose of my self by flight, into certain obscure Woods not far off, whereby I might not onely be secure from the danger of my mortal enemy, but have conveniency by my escape to procure some relief to succour the distressed Lady; which accident hath brought me into Lydia , to renew my Fathers old suit to Euarchus for the recovery of our ancient inheritance the principality of Iberia , since the Lady as I hear hath not onely lost her Castle, but I my hopes; for she is constrained to become a captive wife to the cruel Tyrant Tygranes Duke of Colches . And this, dear Eumenes , is the sad story of my fortunes; and the more to be lamented, since I am not certain to what resolution my Uncles thoughts will be brought, he yet being determined but to send an Ambassadour, to treat for a peaceable and friendly restitution, whilest in the mean time I languish between hope and despair, But scarce was he come to this issue, when they might hear the hounds in full cry pursue the foot-steps of the dead Boar towards the place where they were, which gave Eumenes no conveniency for reply, hardly time sufficient to protect the testimony of his Victory, from the violent cruelty of the Dogs, who seemed not to be pacified in his death. Wherefore rising from the seat where he sate, and snatching up the head, he held it upon the point of the Spear in the air, whilest the Hounds with open mouths, seemed to besiege his person, until the Huntsmen themselves coming in to the quarrel, were forced to defend him from their rude violence; and in that imployment he continued, while the other almost lost company, had leasure to assemble, to perfect the triumph for the slaughter of that cruel Beast, that had done so much mischief in the Countrey, terrifying the common people with the frightful apprehension of his aspect, who durst not travel by the places of his habitation, to follow their necessary occasion. But not long had the Ladies satisfied their curiosities in beholding the dead Boar, though yet at some distance scarce believing him so in effect, as also infinitely commending Eumenes valour, that had in single combat brought him to his destruction, as they understood by Cassianus that had been the eye-witness of the encounter, but the King and Queen in a gentle hand-gallop, made towards them through the same passage that Cassianus had found out in his solitary contemplation, which gave Eumenes occasion, accompanied with his friend Prince Cassianus , to present himself before their persons, not onely offering to the Queen the Boars head as a sacrifice to her beauty, but desired humbly to be excused that he had unwillingly interrupted their sport. When Cassianus had certified Euarchus fully of all the proceedings in that combat, wherein he let nothing pass that concerned his friends honour, and also made the King acquainted with his breeding, condition and Countrey, he soon obtained absolution for his valiant fact: however, the envious evening coming on, which denyed the undertaking of a new Chace, a cessation from that sport was quickly proclaimed by the Kings command, and the rather, for that they returned with victory and spoil: wherefore Euarchus and Hiachinthia taking the two friends into their own Coach, whilst the skillful Coach-man made what haste he could through the rugged way, they required of Eumenes not onely the relation of his own Travells, but the satisfaction of the manner of the government of the Island of Cyprus , since their revolt from the King of Egypt . Eumenes receiving this injunction from the King, however he supposed, he rather desired to have his curiosity satisfied in his ability, then that his knowledge could any way be instructed by his relation, excusing himself concerning his own particular adventures, as not worthy his Majesties attention, he prosecuted this discourse: Truly Sir, said he, it is no small difficulty for a person of my mean capacity, to particularize the true causes or motives of the first revolts in any Kingdom, though you are pleased to give me the imployment, since as the complaints for the most part are confused and uncertain, more governed perhaps by the passions and fancies of the common people, then grounded upon right and knowledge; so of the other side, it cannot be denied, but that oftentimes prerogative and power will finde out wayes and shifts, to cast off the aspersions, either against themselves or favourites; though I must confess, both may have reason enough to defend their allegations, before an indifferent auditory, if such a tribunal could be instituted; but that not being possible to be had upon earth, most commonly such contentions are onely ended by the Sword; which fate hath befell the fruitful Island of Cyprus , though now it be established in a perfect prosperity. To this purpose, the King of Egypt , natural Lord of those Countries, having placed a Lady of eminent vertues as Supreme Governess for him, both in Cyprus and Pamphilia , whether the people presuming upon the supposed weakness of her sex, joyned with the inconstancy of their own humours and dispositions; or rather being put on to demand something (though they knew not very well what) that seemed to appertain to their ancient priviledges, by the ambition of some of the Nobility; (that belike seemed not very well satisfied) of a sudden began most violently, to complain of the obstruction of their customs, as also of the cruelty of the laws made (as they pretended) both against their freedom and consciences; and being transported with these furious fancies, when the Court least thought of their disorders, they run violently to all the chief Temples of the City, where I may say, they committed many outrages, of nearest affinity with sacriledge and rebellion: but the Governesses extraordinary mildness and temper, not onely quickly asswaged all these begun misdemeanors, but readily pardoned their offences, though she very well knew, many principal persons were interessed in the occasion of those tumults; notwithstanding she wisely and discreetly seemed not to take notice of them, in regard such intimations might create those jealousies, that probably would again kindle a new fire of discontent and apprehension. However the Court and Councel of Egypt , having understood these proceedings, whose greatness of Empire and Power in command, could brook neither resistance nor dispute, thought it not agreeing with the honour and dignity of their King (whose authority before these accidents, seemed rather to be adored then contraverted) to suffer these insolencies to escape, without some remarkable severity, as well in regard of the nobility as the people; presently designed a huge Army for these Countries, composed of the best and oldest Souldiers Egypt could produce; and these Troops were put under the command of a person of the same Nation, that better knew how to punish facts committed, by a kinde of harsh cruelty, then to compose differences newly begun, with mildness and temper; rather imitating those Physicians, which use desperate remedies to perfect the body the sooner, then by prolonging application to save part, for fear the whole should perish. In short, whose experience in the Wars was more ancient and glorious, then his nature any way relenting; insomuch as like a storm coming afar off, demonstrated by lightning and thunder, he gave the people cause of fear and terrour, before the tempest arrived; which caused many of them, by the report onely, to quit their dwellings; as of the other side, not a few of the Noblemen, that were the least confident of their own loyalty, presently engaged one another in private counsels. As soon as this great General arrived, he not onely dispossest the Governess her self of her chief authority, by producing a larger commission, but seized upon the persons of many of the Nobility, whose lives were publickly sacrificed to his fury, whilst terrour and amazement seized the hearts of the common people: notwithstanding this rough demeanour, he proclaimed every where, should be maintained by the the Sword, until his own thoughts could become satisfied, of the Subjects entire obedience to his commands. These rigorous and new proceedings, quickly involved the whole Island of Cyprus in a trembling confusion, as well as in a future rebellion, insomuch as almost all people entertained these strange beginnings, as sad omens, if not prevented by some timely resistance, that threatned a general destruction, as well to their lives as estates; when as formerly they held themselves the freest Subjects of the world, by reason of those priviledges they had gained, by the indulgent natures of their many good and merciful Princes. And thus, Sir, I must say, was the first fatal fire kindled in Cyprus , which since hath been augmented by the powerful interest of most of the Potentates in Asia: For as upon these pretences the people presently flew out into open hostility, so did they call in as many forreign Princes, as they could to their assistance, who glad of any occasion to give bounds to the Egyptian Monarchy , that then began to swell to a vast largeness in command, readily contributed their best endeavours; especially the Father of Orsames, King of Syria , insomuch as the effects since have produced so much blood and slaughter, with other varieties of success and fortune, that many books might be amplified with the story; until the succession of command fell to this gallant Duke, that now bears sway in that Region, who hath been so principal an instrument of the happiness and present flourishing condition of the Island (being not more valiant in War, then wise in Peace) that the King of Egypt himself, is not onely reduced at present to that state, by reason of his powerful contentions against him, both by Sea and Land, that he seeks peace upon any terms, with a resignation of all his pretented rights; besides the people in regard of the Dukes prudent Government, with their own industry, (who at the beginning of these stirs were rather poor and contemptible fisher-men, then approved and credible Merchants) are become now so terrible upon the Sea, that by their numerous Vessels for trading, they fetch home to their own quarters, all the riches of the world; the Queen hereupon put a stop to Eumenes discourse with this language: And yet I have heard, said she, all the recompence he can procure from their gratitudes, is onely a bare pension for his support and subsistance; neither will they willingly allow him any other Title, then their servant, however his valour and conduct in the Wars, upon all occasions, brings to their assistance the best spirits of Asia , as conceiving him most worthy to be their master in Martial affairs. 'Tis true Madam, answered Eumenes , I must needs confess the people themselves, although naturally they are no souldiers, being altogether addicted to the industry of the spade, by which faculty they have performed admirable things, to the wonder of other Nations, yet are they crafty enough to maintain their own Liberties, and suffer the Duke to enjoy no other jurisdiction over them, then what they are content from time to time, to afford him for their best commodity and advantage: nevertheless it is thought, if his ambition were equal to his power, he might make himself absolute Prince of the Countrey, without contradiction, having the Army so entirely at his command; as well in regard of many factions amongst their Governours, as by reason of the necessity of one head and Governour; especially if they should purchase to themselves peace from the King of Egypt , who (as I said before) now seems with earnestness to desire it of them. After the King had a little smiled upon the Queen at Eumenes discourse, so much pretending to the Dukes interest and commendation, being himself extreamly perfect in the knowledge of those parts, he began to argue with him in this manner: Although I cannot, said the King, but approve of your observations, and much more commend your affectionate rhetorick in the Dukes behalf, who no doubt in the general deserves as much as you have said, yet I must not conclude altogether with you in belief, concerning this easie accession to sovereignty, though his intentions were directed to those ambitions: for notwithstanding you may see him alwayes attended with glorious and gallant Troops in the Field; a prospect, I must confess, that cannot but dazle youthful or common eyes; yet when it shall be considered withal, that the common Souldiers (who for the most part are rather carried on to their imployments, by their own private gain, then by the advancement of their General) are onely payed by certain treasures appointed by the people, entirely faithful to their designs, that upon the least disorders may obstruct or detain their wages, either in part, or in the whole; it will be a very difficult matter, to unite them absolutely in the Dukes designs against the Common-wealth; especially when it shall be also remembred, that most of all the Towns in the Island, are not onely strong both by nature and art, but are continually guarded by the Burgers themselves, without having any relation at all to the General, and so by consequence are furnished with provisions of every sort, insomuch as the least fort of the Countrey, is neither to be surprized by any manner of stratagem, or to be taken without a very long siege, which would give the Dukes Army without pay, occasion enough to change their resolutions in the interim; and rather seek to betray his person, then advance his ambition: Wherefore I hold him to be much a wiser man, in desisting from those attempts, then in entring upon designs, that at the worst may ruine his posterity, and at the best cannot much mend his condition; since at the present, the people afford him so large a pension for his entertainment, that doth more then equal the revenues of many absolute Princes of the inferiour rank, which is enjoyed, as I may say, without either hazzard or trouble. And however the factions of the people, as you have intimated, may seem something to contribute to this probability, yet considering in their natures, how much they are addicted to freedom and equality, though such a necessity should compel a change, I am most confident they would rather call in again their old Prince, then make election of any new; much less the Duke, whom however his birth and titles are more illustrious, yet in their hearts they rank him as once a fellow subject with themselves, to the King of Egypt . And if peace, as you say, should be entirely restored to that Island, the contrary now being a means the more strongly to unite them against the common enemy, yet such is their hate to a jurisdiction of that nature, I am perswaded they would never be brought to that subjection, without an absolute conquest and desolation; witness their not being able, as you have already related to brook it in their lawful King, under whom they seemed to enjoy all manner of felicity and content: 'Tis true, it is otherwise with the Subjects of Syria , who are so wedded to the honour and prosperity of their Prince, that it is unpossible to withdraw their fidelities, by any taxations, or almost oppressions whatsoever, though sometimes their Nobility perhaps, flye out against the power and greatness of favourites, who seem something to obscure their interest with their Sovereign, all dispositions not being alike: As for example, I finde my own Subjects begin already, to be weary of those happinesses under a peaceful Monarch, that other Kingdoms can but onely hope for, after a long and bloody experience: The King at these very words, as if he felt something inwardly at the soul, rested silent for a pretty space; and then again, as if he had anew recollected his spirits, kissing the Queen twice or thrice, he altered the subject of his serious discourse, into another of more variety and delight; which continued them imployed, until they arrived at the Palace Gate, where many lighted Torches attended to conduct him and the Queen up the stairs. Their supper being finished, with no more curious tediousness, then was convenient for the satisfying of the necessity of their appetites, sharpned by their past dayes exercise, a great part of the might was spent in dancing with the Ladies, according to the custom of the delightful Court of Lydia ; in which recreation it was Cassianus fortune, to entertain the beautiful Princess Cloria , as if the Gods intended him the opportunity; but whether his fancy onely made him believe it, or that really he did utter something of that nature to her innocent ears; yet she seemed no way to be warmed by a lovers flames; insomuch as poor Cassianus became of a sudden as frozen as his Mistresses apprehensions; since he too feelingly suspected a denial in that suit, which perhaps his own fears would not sufficiently suffer him to discover to her understanding; and oftentimes too much desire renders us not onely unfit to act, but uncapable to interpret: but however these accidental passages were either executed or entertained, Euarchus and Hyacinthia's unexpected retirement for the present, gave no more opportunity for a further trial of either; which not onely quickly separated the company, but retired the strangers into their several Chambers: where Cassianus gave his eyes no leasure at all to rest, by reason of the discourtesie of his own turbulent thoughts, that drove him from one unquiet fancy to another, until the more charitable morning invited him into something a handsome sleep: but after two hours time, that also was interrupted by factious Dimogoras , who with a certain kinde of storm in his countenance, entred abruptly his Chamber, which freedom he ever challenged, by reason of the confidence he had of his own faithfulness to the Princes designs. After Dimogoras had bestowed upon the Prince some few complements belonging to his dignity, as well as answerable to the season, he let him know he had some discourse of consequence to impart unto him, if he pleased to dismiss his attendants. Those being gone, and he invited by the Prince, to seat himself upon his bed side, for the more conveniency, with a kinde of melancholly and discontented countenance, accompanied with a more hasty and rough delivery, he entertained his ears with this language. Although it be most true, my Lord, said he, that it is given out by the spightful Court, and suffered by the Kings injustice, that both my nature and desires, with a great deal of violence hunt after nothing but contentions, whereby I might come to have some eminent imployment in the Warres; yet I take all the Gods to witness (who best are acquainted with my thoughts) that your entire service is the chief motive of my designs, grounded also upon the consideration both of the present and future honour and glory of our Nation, now almost adulterated by ease and quiet, though principally betrayed to this lethargy by the pernicious Councels of Polinex , that for his own advantage and ends, flatters the King with the opinion of his conceived prosperity, as if never before the like Prince had reigned in Lydia , when as all Asia is scandalized at our Government; for Euarchus by reason of this cold newtrality is esteemed if not an enemy, at leastwise no friend to any, but his own concernments; and so can never expect a faithfull assistance from other States, if he were compelled by the same necessity to require their aid in any of his occasions, though a little for the present he seems to swim in all successful glory. In this inchantment you see it is not onely possible for him to behold your Rights violated by the violent and (I may say) tyrannical oppression of your cruel enemies, with a most quiet if not insensible demeanour, notwithstanding all the tyes of Affection, Kindred, and Religion, but in his own person is wrought in to so low a stupidity, and unworthy ingratitude, that he cannot be brought to bestow the least reward, or so much as any countenance upon men of spirit, fame, and desert; witness one small Title of Honour denyed Lycius the brave Myssean Commander, that so gallantly defended your cause against the King of Armenia's Power. This being sufficiently apprehended in your thoughts, I shall a little shew my own condition, that thereby you may the better judge of me and my designs; to this purpose I must tell you, that ever since I had ability to draw and handle a Sword, I have still vow'd my endeavours to the service of your family, insomuch as when a General was appointed by Euarchus Father with a Royal Army, after that unfortunate Defeat in Mesopotamia , to defend your Mothers Rights, in the Principality of Iberia , against Tygranes Forces, I not onely strongly urged the imployment from the State, but accompanied the Souldiers in the Journey, until we were commanded away by the King; which however hath so seasoned my thoughts with the concernments of your Noble House, that I cannot but continue my Soul, working a just revenge in your behalf, according to the many injuries and indignities you have received: You must now give me leave to come nearer your interest for the present, neither wonder at my intelligence, since I do confidently assure you, that there is scarce a Court design how private soever, but I have knowledge of the resolution, by reason of my Kindred and intimation amongst the chiefest of Euarchus Councellors. With this assurance you must know, that not many dayes ago, there arrived upon the Confines of Lydia, Anaxia the old Queen of Syria , who being for some time beaten at Sea by Storms, as at Land by Tempests, procured by her own restless nature, that could not endure to sit quiet under the security of her Sons Protection, at last is come under the jurisdiction of Euarchus , as I believe with an intention to raise as many Troubles in this Kingdom, as she hath for some years past in other places. As I cannot deny her to be a Lady of excellent Parts, and in her youth of extraordinary Beauty, so by her Birth she is of Corinth , the onely Daughter to the Duke of that Magnificent City, which procured her such a liking by Orsames Father, after the divorce of his former Wife, that with much passion he not onely made her Queen of Syria , but at his death appointed her the sole Guardian, both of his Son and Kingdom. This Office truly she managed with discretion enough, untill the young Kings competent years, joyned with the ambition of some about his person, compelled her of a sudden to leave her jurisdiction, yet not without so much unwillingness and distaste, that the lives of her principal Councellers were sacrificed by reason of the resistance, and her self for a long space was confined to a Castle far from the Court, there to practise more obedience, since her active spirit was deemed to be inconsistent, with the true and necessary subjection befitting a subject, though still honoured as a Mother: However in that place, time and solitary conversations, taught her so much patience or dissimulation, that contrary to all mens expectations she bore this misfortune (so much esteemed repugnant to her nature and constitution) for some years, with an extraordinary pacification, insomuch as the King was induced by reason of these outward testimonies of her absolute conversion, if not in regard of his own filial duty, that could not but demonstrate compassion, to send for her again to the Court, not onely to enjoy the comfort of her conversation, but also to make use of her Councels: Nevertheless she had not long moved in that sphear of glory, being perswaded by some factious dispositions, or over-suspicious and jealous in her own thoughts, before she began to shew evident marks of her inward discontents; for no sooner was the Warre broke out between Orsames and the King of Egypt , (kindled as 'twas said in part by her means) but she flew with all violence to the Egyptian Court, where she hath been until this present, and perhaps would have longer there remained, not knowing else whither well to flye for shelter and protection; if she had not procured an imployment, that at present suits perfectly with her appetite, which is to treat of a Match between the Princess Cloria out Kings Daughter, and Osiris the King of Egypt's Son; and this will no doubt be readily imbraced by Euarchus , since he may thereby hope the better to curb his poor Subjects, who he knows are rather aw'd by his power, then satisfied in his affection. Though Dimogoras seemed still to prosecute his discourse, yet Cassianus at these last words of Cloria and Osiris , felt himself as it were struck with Thunder and Lightning; insomuch as presently turning his face to the wall, he scarce gave any more ear to what he said: Dimogoras finding with some more observation, that the Prince had not onely changed his posture, but his attentiveness, imagined that the very apprehension of Euarchus disaffection to his person, in regard his interest had been so long neglected, was the sole reason of his sudden alteration, though the secret flames of the Princess Cloria's beauty, was the onely occasion of his present distemper, considering the small probability was left him to obtain his desire, now a match of such splendor was offered to her choice After Dimogoras had expected something longer what the Prince would do, he began this discourse; As I cannot blame your nature much, said he, to be troubled, considering the cunning diversions of your Uncle Euarchus , whom as I may say, seeks any thing in a manner, before your good and benefit; so of the other side it doth not become a Prince of your birth and extraction, to entertain dejectly these passages, when you may be assured that almost all Lydia will contribute bountifully to your present aid and assistance; wherefore I say, since this sloathful man, is so far from being moved in regard of his natural inclination to ease and pleasure, out of those courses which his flatterers have bewitched him in, we must endeavour to disturb him in his Government; and the rather, for that we see he intends another effect of tyranny, by a new alliance with the Egyptian State, to maintain his absolute jurisdiction over the Liberties of his People, though Cloria were more properly bestowed upon your self of the same Blood and Religion, then on a person, whose Nation hath ever had designs pernicious to this Commonwealth; upon these considerations as it cannot be but thought convenient by the whole Kingdom to look to its own safety, so by an unavoidable necessity, we must have presently assembled the great Councell, to put a sudden stop to these threatning events, that like ominous Comets, seem at this instant to have direful Aspects in our Horizon, blazing as it were destruction to all our happiness and prosperity; and for that Euarchus will never endure to hear of such a remedy without meer compulsion; we will attempt to stir up the rage of the discontented Myssian , over whom Orsames the King of Syria , hath such an absolute jurisdiction, that Euarchus Authority will be very little esteemed in those parts, notwithstanding the legallity of his Title; and that King, as you very well know, cannot be but well pleased, to lay hold of any occasion, whereby this new intended alliance between the Crowns of Lydia and Egypt , may be blasted in the bud, before it come into any mature ripeness. As he was further proceeding in these exclamations against the Government, they were both interrupted by a Messenger from the King, not onely to know how the Prince had rested the night past after his dayes sport in hunting, but withal to desire his company in a ceremonious Courtship, he intended in person to bestow upon the old Queen of Syria his Wives Mother, though before the Officer could be sent for into the Princes Chamber, Dimogoras suddenly took his leave. When Cassianus had humbly returned his thanks to the King, for his favour in inquiring (as he said) any way after his concernments, he told the Messenger, that however he could not be very apprehensive of his own danger, yet he must complain a little of his indisposition, which he feared would hinder him from rendering his Majesty that service he commanded, especially since the Ceremony was necessarily to be performed in so great an assembly; rather his intentions were for some few dayes to keep his Chamber, as he said, to try whether that retirement would in any kinde contribute to his amendment, since he found his thoughts opprest by melancholly fancies. This quickly gave occasion to most of the Court to visit him, yet at those times when he perceived himself free from those complements, (that he counted no other then meer disturbances) he would often dispute with his discontents in this nature, which proved a great deal more uncomfortable, in regard he communicated his thoughts to none. O Cassianus , said he, to what dangerous rocks have thy fortunes led thee, not to be relieved, but by an inhospitable compliance, with those, that perhaps more for their own ambition, then thy good, endeavour thy Uncles ruine? O gentle Cloria , is it possible that these thoughts in thy servants breast, can be any more concealed from thy knowledge, then from the Gods divinest Oracle? what greater indignity can be offered to the heavens, then to harbour in one heart, both love and treason, at the same time? Consider, O unworthy Cassianus , with what affectionate protestations Euarchus hath hitherunto entertained all thy concernments, which hath produced effects already, to the sending of an Ambassadour to the King of Armenia , upon whose return, and not before, thou art to expect thy doom; and for this pretended love between Cloria and Osiris , perhaps the report is onely a bare fancy, grounded more upon distasteful suspition, then upon authentical information, since the old Queen of Syria's necessities, gave her reason enough, to seek both retirement and reception, without any other design whatsoever: nay further it may very probably be supposed, that Dimogoras interest or spleen, may administer occasions both of too much jealousie, and over hasty action; wherefore Cassianus , be not thou ignobly the chief instrument of Dimogoras malice, and the onely stale to others ends. Thus he imployed his time, whilst a brave Mask was preparing at Court, for the entertainment of the Queen of Syria ; which in the interim filled every ones expectation, though it continued still Cassianus in his Chamber; however, as I said before, more visited then his thoughts desired. For this great Triumph there was designed a large Hall within the City of Sardis , supported with Corinthian Pillars of Theban Marble, erected at the first onely for the Coronation of the Kings of Lydia : it was beautified with excellent pictures of Moysaich work, enriched with Azure and Gold; the sides represented several delightful Landskips, composed for the most part of natural stones; and wherein true representation any place wanted, the defects became supplied, with exquisite painting of most of the best hands of Asia: the floor was all wrought over with divers figures of Jet and Ivory, here and there also graced by other colours: when the night came of this glorious solemnity, Euarchus himself was mounted on a transparent Throne, supported upon the backs of Golden Lions: over his head was the portraiture of Jupiter , much greater then the life, bestriding a huge Eagle, and holding Thunder in his hand; four steps below his feet lay, as it were a sleep, a silver Unicorn and brazen Lion, entangled with intermixt Roses and Thistles: on the other side sate Hyacinthia in a state of white Sattin, embroidered with the story of Phaeton , confusedly tumbling from his Fathers Chariot, as also wearing upon his youthful head Apollo's burning rayes, the onely period of his rash and foolish ambition; which by the cunning placing of certain Torches behinde, seemed to give a kinde of a natural light in the imagination of the earnest spectators: between them two degrees higher, was placed the old Syrian Queen, in a chair of purple Velvet, beseeming the gravity of her age, wrought very thick with Flower de luces: the fair Princess Cloria sate at her grandmothers feet, cloathed all in white, not more to shew forth the innocency of her Virginity, then to become the excellency of her perfections: no sooner had the Lords and Ladies of the Court seated themselves to their best advantages, for the honour of the one, and the beauty of the others, sparkling like so many Stars in the Firmament; but the Kings officer, unto whom the charge was committed, gave present command that the Shew should be discovered; whereupon a large curtain at the farther end of the room by little and little lifted it self up to the uttermost part of the roof, behinde which was represented a large Heaven, curiously figured by many shining clouds: under this seeming concave, was an artificial Globe of the Earth, supported by a huge Atlas , though stooping, who was placed in a vast sea, from whence presently issued forth out of a Rock, seemingly compacted of Gold and Mother of Pearl, the God Neptune , drawn in a Triumphant Chariot by six Dolphins, and guarded by twice as many Meremaids, who after some circumstance, began the first Anti-mask, to the Musick onely of divers Trytons; which being finished, and Neptune retiring with the same Majesty he entred, the Gyant of a sudden shook the Globe he carried upon his shoulder; at which violence the whole seemed to sever in the midst, from whence brake forth in a distracted manner, a multitude of several sorts of people; some falling into the Sea, others climbing upon the rocks to save their lives; though a third company entered the room, and made the second dance with extraordinary skill: after these were retired into their former habitation, the Goddess Venus descended from a cloud in a celestial Chariot, accompanied by many naked Cupids , who with sweet voices and variety of instruments, saluted the King and Queens with this Ditty, to invite their spectators toward the beholding some Revels from Olympus , commanded by Jupiter himself, to give their Majesties entertainment.  What wonder is't that we behold, both Love and Honour crown'd with Gold; And ev'ry eye doth sparkle forth a Deity. Haste then my Char'ot to the Earth, for day hath there a second birth: You Cupids sing, whilst I salute the Lydian King. 'Tis mighty Jove (great Prince) that sends the Gods below to be your friends, When Triumphs seem to entertain the Syrian Queen. But Hyacinthia , 'tis to you, that Juno now begins to bow; Who smiles to see, such mortals as your Subjects be. Hence then be gone you winged Boyes, and tell Olympus of our joyes; Put out each Star, for here are Lights out-shine them far. This also being ended, the Queen of Love again ascended the skie, when of a sudden the Heavens opening, all the Gods appeared in several places, who insensibly were descended to the midst of the Stage, where they performed a Majestick or ceremonious march, and retired again in the same order they came, until their Throne being something elevated in opposition to the Kings, they remained fixed, whilst by changing of the scene from a kinde of an inchanted Palace in a beautiful Island, issued many Knights and Ladies, there belike detained for some time, by their several fates in love adventures; who passing two by two over a silver Bridge, they soon appeared in an orderly manner, upon the Theatre, before the spectators; where having finished also their designs with other varieties, the rest of the night was spent in continuation of those magnificent sports: In the interim, poor Cassianus something weary of his own solitary discontents, had quitted his melancholly Chamber, to give a little recreation to his thoughts; and to this purpose was retired into an obscure nook of the Hall, when at the same instant, he might see the Princess Cloria taken out to dance, which she performed with so spiritful a modesty, that her frequent blushes, did no more then adde grace, to those skilful paces she was to tread; which being finished, with a courteous smile she appeared to congratulate the youthful Masker, that had enjoyed the honour of her person in the pastime, whilst her dignity commanded him with humility, again to place her in her seat, according to the custom; where her Princely Grandmother receiving her in her armes, with many kisses, sealed both her approbation and affection, whispering also something in her ear, that caused Cloria at the same instant to cast down her Diamond-eyes upon the ground, with so bashful an innocency, that all the company might easily judge, something was spoken to her apprehension, that she did not very well like or understand. But however, Cassianus who all the while beheld these passages, with a strong jealousie and violent love, began to muster up his own discontents in a despairing form; that rendred his imagination certain, that Anaxia could intimate nothing to the Princess Cloria , but the offered love of Osiris ; which drove him to so absolute a distraction, after many fruitless and silent complaints, that he resolves presently to leave the Court, and to retire himself to some obscure habitation, where he would onely bewail his own misfortunes, or else procure a disguise that might admit him into Cloria's presence, without suspicion, and by that means purchase a convenience to discover his own affection: this no sooner was represented to his imagination, but it was passionately entertained by his fancy; so that laying hold on the confusion of the time, and the imployment of the company, he instantly went into the Stable, after he had accommodated some necessary things in his Chamber, and took out his horse to transport himself he knew not whither, though the night season favoured so much his intention, that before morning he was a pretty distance from the City of Sardis , not easily to be overtaken by any search; and not many dayes after fell by chance into a most beautiful Countrey, bespotted all over with several coloured fertilities, some Meadows, some arrable Grounds, every one intermixt with luxurious Vines, and bordered again with flourishing Fields of standing Corn of divers ripeness, according to the nature of the Grain; a River fair and winding, courteously contributing to each part of the Territory, a participation of its bounty. This seeming Paradise was bounded on all sides by an appearing Forrest of even spread trees, that by their equal growth resembled so many brothers of one birth, not consenting to the ambitious overtopping of any of their fraternity; certain other lesser groves (within the compass) in several places, adorned the superficies of the earth, affording a convenient shade for Cattle, and their Pastors in the heat of the day, to retire for the ease of the one, and the rural delight of the other; where Coridon and Phillis might meet freely, to enterchange their love discourses, and not be discovered by their too watchful parents. Cassianus invited by the attractive prospect of the place, and denied to travel by the extraordinary heat of the day, made choice for his rest of a grassie Carpet, furnished exactly with many embroideries of nature, wrought by the Goddess chief skill, and died with the excellent tinctures of the most absolute time of the year. This habitation was covered over head with an archt Canopy of spreading branches, so thick woven together with green leaves, that Phoebus had no power to dart through his beams by any skill or violence: the gentle running of a Christal Stream hard by, gave leasure for the clear Water to convoy it self by the secret Conduits of the Earth, to the roots of the Trees, by which coolness they became more fruitful and flourishing. These perfect delights, also invited Cassianus , into a kinde of a necessary, if not pleasant slumber; however scarce had he entred really into the quieting of his disturbed senses, but he was again summoned by his ear to a new distraction, since the sound of musick call'd his eyes to behold the object that gave it birth, which soon instructed him of a certain troop of people, that directed their steps towards the place of his abode, which gave him warning presently to rise from his seat, to afford them the meeting, rather then to be surprized in his drowsie posture; but before he could approach to so near a distance, as to discover distinctly the company, he was encountered by a certain ancient Forrester, handsomely clad in green, with a horn about his neck, as the ensign of his profession, who quickly saluted him with this language. Sir, said he, as it is not my intention, either to inquire of your quality, or business, since neither concerns our present affairs; so, of the other side, I cannot but attempt your charity, because we have some need of it at this time; be pleased therefore to know, that the pleasant Countrey you are now in, is inhabited by three sorts of people, that is to say, Gentlemen, Forresters, and Shepheards; however, there is such a mutual agreement between them all, that neither envies the other happiness, or prosperity; the greatest using so gentle a familiarity to the meanest, that he is very well contented with his subjection; and the rather, because it is not lasting, since every year new Magistrates are chosen, by the free election of every one in particular; where none of any sort is excluded from the Government, which renders all satisfied; and in this course of rural policy, we follow our pleasures, and occasions; some in hunting, others in increasing their innocent flocks, and the rest in composing Poetical Verses, which on Holy Dayes are sung to our unskilful musick; where the best however, gains a certain victory that yields him content. In this manner I have lived for many years, being by some accident driven out of my own naturall Countrey; having onely one daughter to be the inheritrix of my fortune; whose beauty, as I hope, rather then my substance, hath procured her two worthy suitors, of so just an equality in her eye, that though she be not at all ambitious of a choice, it being onely my pressing care to see her married before I dye; she is determined to marry one of them: however, she is resolved not to make the election, nor I, because we are unwilling to hazzard a faction in that quiet course we intend to continue; wherefore it was decreed by the common consent of all, that the first stranger we met, should be the decider of the difference, since this is the last day prefixt, by a certain rash oath I made to see her Nuptials performed; so that by this means we take away all occasions of partiality, by making fortune the Judge, for that both have sworn to stand to the arbitration, without mutiny or disturbance, and willingly assist in the intended ceremonies, which are presently to be performed, by a holy Priest in a little Chappel within the Forrest; so that, if you please to take upon you this office, you will not onely afford us a perpetual obligation, but I shall prepare my self instantly, to inform you of the qualities and condition of the Wooers, who are in yonder Troop, that still as you see, do expect the issue of my desire. Cassianus , after he had for some time dwelt upon the prettiness of the contention, and resolved to be a courteous Judge in the Love quarrel, with a deep sigh, reflecting upon his own concernments, which this difference seemed to touch, returned him this answer: Reverend Sir, although I am not ignorant, said he, that arbitrations, of what nature soever, most commonly leave one party discontented, and therefore consequently is likely to procure me some dis-favour; yet to comply with your desire, I am content to take upon me the office, not onely because I finde the business pressing, by reason of your oath; but also, hoping that the promises by the contenders made to each other, will be an occasion to keep me safe from the evill will of either. Then said the Forrester, after he had thanked him for his courtesie, it will be convenient for me to let you know the state of the Suitors, and their several pretentions, which I shall do shortly, with few circumstances, since the far spent day, will scarce else afford time to perform the necessary Ceremonies belonging to the Marriage. The two contenders, said he, or rather Love-rivals, have for some years pretended to my Daughter Mantuina , a young Maid, whose bashfulness hath kept her back from entertaining either of their affections, although their persons and qualities may challenge an exact beauty, much more the fortune of a strangers Childe but I that rather look upon the content of Posterity, to fortifie me in this course of life, I have now taken on me, since I have small hopes to return again into my own Countrey, being kept from thence by the unjust power of my mortal enemy, a story too long at this time to relate; although I am accustomed to make known my oppressions to most Passengers that visit these parts, being violently ambitious to have her bestowed, lest my sudden death also, might leave her to the World without a Guide, and by that means endanger her Honour and Prosperity, have made choice of one of these two, whose laudable comportments and constant love, have rendred them worthy of my regard, though neither can pretend to the highest Fortune, which suits well enough to my desires, since my intentions are to spin out the rest of my dayes in this private, however contented, course of life; and if we do chance to return again to our own, there will be sufficient to maintain us in that dignity we were born unto; in the mean time, it stirs up a compassion in all sorts of people that know us, that I am forced in this manner to descend from that quality I have formerly lived in. But to come to the point: these two contenders, the one is called Fridius , the other Navarinus ; the first a Shepheard by extraction, though his Predecessors left him well enough to become a Gentleman; which hath also inflamed his minde with aspiring thoughts, scarce to be contained within the bounds of rural delights; the other a Nobleman born, but wanting means, hath subscribed his aims onely within the limits of a Countrey life, and in all probability is likely so to continue: which two in person, are to plead their Causes, before you their designed Judge; wherein, each is to speak what he can for his own advantage, to procure your Arbitration favourable, whereby he may become the desired Husband of my Daughter Mantuina , sitting upon yonder rising Bank, the prepared Tribunal of this Controversie, to which purpose our company attend our approach. Cassianus , although he was most willing to have enquired further of the Forresters condition, and adventures, yet finding the occasion could not admit of any delay, contented himself onely with obeying his desire, which led them both to the expecting Troop; where having saluted every one in particular, they marched to the little Hill, and seated themselves after this manner: First, the intended Bride was placed uppermost, cloathed in a green Gown, with a chaplet of Flowers upon her head, carrying another Garland in her hand to Crown the Conquerour, accompanied by Cassianus the elected Judge; whilst the two Pleaders stood of both sides, the one in the habit of a Gentleman, as the other apparelled like a Shepheard; and when silence was three times proclaimed by a Cryer, Fridius , who seemed to have the prerogative first to speak, began in this sort to open his Cause: Most worthy Arbitrator, said he, as I esteem your Sentence the greatest that can befal me, since it must determine my chiefest happiness; so of the other side, I cannot but be most confident of the success, having so absolute a right in my pretension, though I will freely confess an equality of affection and prosecution: for 'tis apparent to all the auditory, that from a mean condition, I have created in my self a Princes soul, tending to the highest preferment, by which I have endeavoured to out-do my own fate; whilst the life of my adversary promiseth so little possibility of advancement, that he hath pulled down his thoughts below his Birth, to give way to contempt, making himself less then nature intended him, like fire buried in the Cinders, wanting agitation and effect, whereas the property of the flame should aspire: or rather resembling a cow'd Lion, for want of action, so proves a scorn to other Beasts; for 'tis not a Lions Skin, but his Heart, that ought to render him formidable. If the fair Mantuina be given to me, said he, she shall (in all likelihood) possess Riches and Power, the two essential properties of Greatness; and be, as it were, every day in a Lottery, ready when Fortune will, to be exalted to the highest Throne of Honour by new attempts; whereas, being Wife to my Adversary, she can never hope for more then she hath; scarce be assured of protection in what she now enjoyeth, All things endued with life, look upward, as he affirmed; when those that are mortified, fall alwayes downward, to their proper center, onely fit to be trod upon: 'Tis ambition, said he, that warms the Blood, and renders it Noble, whereas sloth and want of desire, causeth obstructions, which hinder glory; since the great Monarchs of the World, could not have purchased to themselves Fame or Empire, if they had not advanced their thoughts beyond their present condition. And last of all, he pretended 'twas the nature of Beasts onely to preserve what they had, but of Man to seek what he had not; and for these reasons he desired the fair Mantuina of the Judge. When Fridius had ended, Navarinus with no less affection to the beauteous Mantuina , but with more modesty stood forth to plead his Cause, and said; That although he could not deny but by reason of his necessity, he had suited his minde to his ability, yet he held himself as deserving as his adversary; for 'twas not Wealth as he said, but Vertue that renders a man truly Noble, which consisted more in tempering of ambition, then violently aiming at Honours, since smiling Prosperity was but the act of Fortune, and a forced satisfaction, the true mark of Fortitude; nor did his moderation, as he said, hinder the acceptance of Preferment when conveniently it may he had, but taught him the better how to use it when it was obtained; for that man must needs be more happy that can content himself with any thing, then he that could be satisfied with nothing. Courage, said he, never shews it self better, then in overcoming ones own passions, nor is personal Poverty a derogation, when it is not accompanied with a supine neglect, or a wilful guilt, but rather a magnanimity, when it can be born with patience. A Diamond loseth not its esteem for being set in Horn, or the Sun his influence because often obscured by accidental Clouds. A King is a King, said he, although he do not alwayes wear the Crown; and for the fair Mantuina he alledged, was likelier to command his affections with felicity, that sought a unity in the lowest course of life, rather then his rivals, who could be in love with none; and he that is prepared to encounter with Adversity, knows best how to use Prosperity: however, said he, it is a higher act of glory to refuse Honour, then to enjoy it; and for these reasons he claimed the prerogative in his Plea, and consequently the beauteous Bride for his reward. After the Cassianus had considered the Arguments, and natures of the Lovers, he briefly delivered his judgement in these words, not willing too long to protract the designed Nuptials: Fridius , he said, had shewed more ambition, Navarinus the greater temper; the one might obtain the higher honour, but the other the longer security; glory seemed to attend the actions of Fridius , content the humility of Navarinus ; the one promised more hope, the other less fear; the one was endued with a Princes soul, which of necessity must put him on to dangerous and hazzardable attempts, the other more resembling a Lover was likeliest to continue the unity of affections without separation; Fridius was fitter to be a Monarch, but Navarinus to become a Husband; wherefore he judged the beauteous Mantuina to the latter for a Wife, and the Crown she carried in her hand, to the former as a Conquerour; which extreamly pleased the whole Assembly, onely discontented Fridius could not be perswaded, to assist at the intended Ceremony; alledging, that since he had lost his Bride in Venus quarrel, he would endeavour to regain his reputation in Mars's profession, and presently took his leave of the company, to put his intention into execution, with the general dislike of them all, having before the Arbitration faithfully promised the contrary. But however this abrupt department of Fridius displeased the joyful Troop, yet they resolved to prosecute their intentions, and to that purpose instantly rose from their seats, and in an orderly procession, directed their course towards Hymens Temple, not far off, built of white Marble, inclosed within a Cypres Grove, where the Priest attended to perform his office, cloathed in a saffron Robe; who taking lovely Mantuina by the hand, after having a little instructed her concerning her duty, he led her to the high Altar, where she was solemnly espoused to joyful Navarinus , whilst in the mean time, the roses of her fair cheeks, seemed to get the absolute victory over the pure ivory of her face; which being finished, the rest of the day was spent in such entertainments as were fit for the season, where the Muses seemed to have a principal prerogative. But Cassianus not long contented with those sports, since he was in a manner weary of himself, soon retired into a solitary walk within the Woods, hoping to enjoy in contemplation, some part of those pleasures that the two Lovers expected; where he had not remained scarce a quarter of an hour, crossing his arms, and often casting up his sorrowful eyes to Heaven, as if from thence he onely attended relief, but he was interrupted by the old Priest with this salutation, who belike had noted some storms in his countenance. Sir, said he, finding your posture no way suitable with the time, and my profession also being retired from those exercises, I thought it not altogether preposterous to attempt your patience, to see if my conversation might give you any satisfaction. Cassianus seeing himself saluted in this manner by the reverend Priest, was not onely forced to leave his sad contemplation, but returned him this courteous answer: Truly Father, said he, as my years might pretend very well to the delights of youthful company, yet being so happy as to enjoy yours, I shall think I have changed much for the better, since I may gain double, both by instruction and example. That said the Priest, will be according to the impressions you are inclinable to receive, and the ability of me that should inform; but as for the first, as I cannot any way doubt, since your capacity hath been sufficiently demonstrated in your judgement upon the late controversie; so of the other side, concerning the latter, I may make some question, whether you are not more able to teach then be instructed by my discourse: however, it being my practice and office to speak to the erring world, of their obligation to their Creator, I shall apply my self willingly to that subject upon any occasion you shall give. Of which number said Cassianus , I desire to be one, if you can think your words will not be lost upon so ignorant a person as my self, since many will not be perswaded that either there is a God at all; or that that Divine Power hath any regard of man, for that he suffers oftentimes intollerable injustices to prosper without punishment. Sir, said the Priest, as I will not dispute the tollerated evils, since the mystery is lockt up in his secret bosome from our mortal eyes; besides that our own indulgence to our proper concernments, often blinds our understanding, that we discern not what is right; so of the contrary, it is more apparent then the light that there is a God, Maker and Ruler of all things, besides Nature; since the Sun, Moon, and Stars, with the hugeness and extraordinary effects of them all, governed in an orderly course without confusion, plainly shew an infinite Power, and supernatural Providence: for else, how could the Ocean be kept so constantly within its own bounds, as if over-aw'd to obey, when it is apparent that millions of Rivers, for many hundreds of years, have and do continually run into the Sea, without any increase at all; which according to the course of Nature, must have long since buried the whole earth in a watery tomb, to the absolute destruction of all living things; besides, innumerable other examples to confound the stupidity of that doubt. I grant, said Cassianus , a Supreme Maker, Providence, and an infinite Power, that first created, and now regulates the disorderly rage, or growing increase of natural things, which else of necessity, must at last multiply, to almost an infinite Mass, not to be contained within the worlds compass; but whether this immense Essence imply it self in so low a consideration, as to think upon us and our affairs, must rest a question. Why not said the Priest? when it is most certain, and by you confest in general terms, that the least Grass of the Field cannot flourish, dye, and spring again in its due season, without the assignment of this Power and Providence; since it is not within the capacity of all the Monarchs of the Earth, to adde growth of the breadth of one single hair to the stature of any Dwarf; or within the skill of all the Philosophy in the world, to make a Flower without Earth and the Sun, that give it natural being: much more, if this Goodness afford such favour to senseless things, giving them life and lustre, will have a greater care of Man created in so high an excellency, since all other things are but meerly ordained for his use and subsistance. No doubt Father, said Cassianus , but he hath an eye upon the preservation of mankinde, more especially then other Creatures, since he is endued with understanding in some sort to know his Creator; but however it is not necessary, that that knowledge proceeds from something that is immortal and eternal. From whence then, said the Priest, doth this Science of knowing God come? Either it must be in the Body, or in the Soul; in the Body certainly it is not, since most Creatures are furnished with greater excellencies of Sense; therefore it must be in the Soul that hath a different faculty, which makes Man capable of Discourse, that a Beast is not, because it lacks the use of reason to distinguish; for Fowls, as we see by experience, do not want Organs to utter words; witness Parrats and other Creatures, who by custom onely are taught to speak, although they themselves know not what they say, or can answer reasonably to any question demanded them. I confess, said Cassianus , That Mans soul is onely capable of understanding, since it doth alone judge reasonably of things; but whether this Soul be mortal or no is the doubt, since his Creator may have given him that priviledge in this Life, and yet not Eternity hereafter. Certainly, said the Priest, as it might seem an impertinency in God, to have Created in Man a reasonable Soul, to be perpetually extinguished after a time, having made the World and all things in it meerly for his use; so of the other side, it had been an apparent injustice, to have afforded the Subjects greater priviledge and happiness then their Lord, which by consequence must follow, if man had not some prerogative to expect in the other Life, enjoying less felicity in this; for it is most apparent, man onely takes no constant content here, his minde being still full of perturbations, having alwayes a kinde of longing in himself, to have that which he hath not, and a wearisomness of what he possesseth, let his condition be never so seeming prosperous; whereas all other Creatures, are never perplext with the fear of change, or desire of alteration; so that of necessity, man must except something to countervail the miserableness of his condition, since it is his meer knowledge, that renders him unfortunate, and the want of it makes Beasts happy. Truly Father, said Cassianus , as I speak but others Arguments, and not my own thoughts, so I cannot deny, but your reasons have much confirmed my belief. No, no, Son, said the Priest, it is onely a sensual stupidity, that detains men from entering into so clear a consideration of the other world as they ought, proceeding from their lazy and indulgent nature, that is glad to be flattered, either with hopes of living long, or repenting when they please, which makes them frame Arguments against Reason, and their own Consciences, because they are unwilling to take pains, and loath to forego the present fruition: But if I may not be thought to trespass too much upon your patience, I will repeat some plain Verses against the alluring vanities of present delights; and the rather, since the Muses are esteemed principal entertainments amongst us in our Pastoral recreations. With all my heart, said Cassianus , with the addition of my best thanks for your courtesie; which made the old Priest, draw out of his Pocket a Paper that contained these Lines.  What's the profit of every past delight, but to invite a new the appetite? The best applause of men is as a Feather, tost to and fro by various Weather; Which some perhaps may catch; yet when 'tis got, oft proves so troublesome, it pleaseth not. The poor Hermit within his private Cell though worldly accidents were all the Hell, Enjoyes a life by much, more void of care then doth the most commanding Monarch here. The Sensualist in his excess doth finde, a kinde of weariness it leaves behind; For all that we can see, or do, or taste, though they content a while, glut us at last; Or in their own defects do often perish, before they give us time their sweets to relish. Nature her self cannot endure to be, confin'd unto a rule of certainty; As in her choicest beauties here she's seen to vary oft her shew, not alwayes green; The heart of man is angular, the earth being round, must not afford a constant birth Of such delights, to fill each little crook, but with a longing aim 'twill farther look: The soul can onely penetrate the skie, and truly contemplate the Deity; In which will be possest a silent mirth, that cannot be exprest by Pens on earth, So free, so sweet, so full, so wondrous high, and most of all crown'd with Eternity. When the Priest had read these Verses, and was preparing himself for another Discourse, the better to fortifie his reasons, the ancient Forrester with many of the jovial company, suddenly interrupted his intention, pretending the season was neither fit for melancholly or retirement, and earnestly desired Cassianus that he would honour the Lovers with his Presence, as he said, at a small Banquet, accomodated for the solemnization of the Feast; which however it gave the Prince some discontent for the present, so to be hindered from a conversation he more delighted in, in regard of his sad thoughts, yet he could do no less then comply readily with the request, it being so civilly intended; and so went with the Forrester to taste of those dainties prepared for the Nuptials, which entertained them until night; nevertheless, the communication began to take such deep root in the disturbed bosom of Cassianus , that he was not onely determined for a time to put off his resolution of changing his habit, whereby the more commodiously to return into Lydia undiscovered, to solicite his love under another form, to the fair Princess Cloria , but also felt inclinations in his soul to leave the world, since so many hazzards and vexations depended upon the prosecutions of humane designs; and in this posture of uncertain opinion, he continued many dayes, still conversing upon all occasions with the holy Priest, though his variable fancies could not bring forth any stable resolution. But the Forrester having absolutely finished all the Nuptial Ceremonies, and every one of the company being again settled in their several vocations, he invited Cassianus one day into the Woods, to delight himself with the entertainments of Hunting: however, the Dogs being at a fault, and Cassianus desiring to know something more particularly of his Fortune; the Forrester under a shady Oak began this discourse for his satisfaction, after he had made some apology for the circumstance of a story he was to relate; As it shall not be needful, said he, to let you know my name, for that I desire to have that conceal'd, since otherwise my Enemies might have opportunity, again to disturb me in my quiet rest, which I have endeavoured to enjoy under this simple disguise; so of the other side it is most necessary, that I tell you I am a Nobleman of Syria , (because from thence ariseth the cause of my unjust banishment) where the King now reigning called Orsames , was left an Infant by his dead Father, under the protection of his Mother named Anaxia , and so remained until the Laws of the Kingdom, gave him the full power of the Government into his own hands; which notwithstanding the high spirited Queen, with a certain favourite she had, not bearing with any patience, was forcibly confined to her Chamber, whilst her Servant lost his life in the resistance. Thus she continued her imprisonment, until the Kings duty, and the policy of one Philostros , that belonged unto the Queen, procured her again her Liberty: But Anaxia not yet content, with this priviledge of being released, began to cast about in her active minde, how she might be also interessed as formerly in State Affairs, and to that purpose imployed Philostros , as a crafty instrument to compass her desire; who in a short time so well plaid his Cards, although for his own advantage, that he not onely became an intimate Councellor to the King, but put his own Mistress clean out of favour with her Son, whereby he might have the better opportunity, to mannage all Court businesses himself, since he knew, she could not but obscure, or at least interrupt his greatness, with the absolute power he intended. The Queen whose courage could not easily be supprest, as her wit was not to be limited, began publickly to cast all her affection upon her second Son Orestes , in requital as she thought of the Kings disrespect to her Person, the onely heir apparent to the Crown, since Orsames his Brother had no issue at all; and to that purpose not onely gave him free liberty, but powerful assistance, in his love and courtships he had long pretended to a young Lady though a stranger, of great birth under her protection, called Alciana , whereby he might be rendered more powerful to oppose Philostros proceedings, as well in the ample kindred of the Lady, as in the hope she should give the kingdom of a plentiful posterity by her: but the subtil favourite, not alone apprehending the growing danger to his Master, by the foresaid greatness of his Brother, since all mens eyes were cast upon him, as the unquestionable Successor, Orsames not being like to have Children, but willing also to exercise his spight against the Queens plots, out of ambition not to be out-witted by a Woman possest the King privately, with a jealous opinion, of the dangerous consequence of such a conjunction, himself being without issue, since the people would be more apt, as he said, to look upon his Brothers established House, then his own present Government: When as long as he was unmarried, the eyes of the multitude, would be diverted to other confused objects of pretenders, not absolutely settled upon any one: And this was sufficient, with the addition of Philostros Counsel, no less then an Oracle in the belief of Orsames , to cause him to send for his Brother, and taking him aside into a private Gallery, began to expostulate with him in this manner. Orestes , said he, I know you cannot be so ill natured, as to forget the affection I have alwayes born you as a Brother, nor do I believe, the world is not sufficiently perswaded, of the care I have of you as your Prince; which two tyes, must draw from me both for your good and my safety, rather a discreet admonition, then a commanding injunction, since my desire is it should be so interpreted and executed by you: know then, that I understand, there is a private affection growing, if not already gone too far, between you and Alciana , a Match I conceive neither convenient for your State, or the welfare of Syria ; since you are not onely a great Kings Son born, but likely to be Inheritor of my Crown and Dignity, which also would distaste the whole Kingdom, when your thoughts should be perswaded, rather to make election of a stranger then one of your own Countrey, since there are so many beyond her worth your regard: but to avoid further expostulation, and to make trial of your obedience, it being the Laws of Syria , that the next Heir should not marry without the consent of the Prince, that you presently lay down your affections, and entertain no new ones without my privity. This I conjure you to perform, both out of the love you ought to bear me as a Brother, and the reverence you owe me as a Prince, without examining further my reasons, if you mean to enjoy my smiles, and not undergo the heavy weight of my indignation; and left him also at the same instant in a Sea of confusion, to converse onely with his unruly imaginations; which continued Orestes for some time, as it were frozen in his despair, until having sufficiently tired himself with adversities of fancies, sometimes complaining against his Brothers cruelty, and otherwhile cursing Philostros policy, at last resolved to carry the news to his almost lost Mistress; where, after he had with many sighs and more tears, laid open the Tyrannical Sentence of the King, as he called it; they both cast their pittiful looks at one another, as if they meant to blame themselves for the misfortune, which for the present parted them, like two that went to their Graves, never more to enjoy the comfort of each others conversation: But Orestes not being long able to bear the torment of this rigid injunction, flew to Anaxia's affection for a redress; whom as he conceived, wanted neither power nor will to assist him in his extremity; and she as quickly with compassion, carried his complaints to Orsames , fortified with all the reasons the prerogative of a Mother could use; however the absolute power of Philostros beat down with violence her diligent endeavours, pretending the safety of the King, and the prosperity of Syria , was to be preferred either before a Brothers foolish passions, or a Mothers preposterous desires; which onely left the enraged Queen to mutiny against her Sons seeming disobedience, finding how much her own power was lessened, by the growing greatness of him, she had preferred to maintain it. But notwithstanding Orsames consent could not be won, to the continued loves of the young couple, yet Orestes by the help of his witty and indulgent Mother, not onely was encouraged still, to prosecute his settled affection to Alciana , but procured means oftentimes to meet his Mistress secretly in a Garden, belonging to the Queens Lodgings; where their passions caused them for the most part to burst forth into these expressions: O Alciana , said Orestes , how unjust are the Gods, to debar us from that conversation, that lovers of meanest condition enjoy with abundant liberty? How happy should we esteem our selves to be, said he, if the open Fields were made privy to our vertuous intentions, and the innocent Birds called as witnesses to our frequent vows, to sing Epithalamions to our Marriage Feasts? O the unhappy state of Crowns so much coveted, and yet brings with it consuming fires of all content, kindled by the raging flames of restless suspicion, the destruction of friendship and Charity. How fortunate should we be dear Alciana , said he, it a poor Cottage were the present habitation for our persons, and a course Bed the resting place for our Loves, rather then be thus fettered with the golden Bands of vain Titles (falsly called Priviledges) that imprisons us from our chief delights, and onely happinesses? Then the fair Alciana with tears instead of expressions, would oftentimes signifie her approbation of his reasons; and then again break forth into these passions of wishing her self rather a Shepheardess then a Princess, so she might freely possess her beloved Orestes , accusing Cupid for want of power or pitty, to let them suffer so undeservedly; also complaining bitterly against the remorseless Rules of State and Policy, that imposed such thraldom upon Lovers against Divine and Humane Laws; then return to a fresh carrieer of weeping, as if she meant to send up her grief to heaven by water, to procure redress, though almost in the same moment she would cast down her eyes and hands, as if despair had beaten back her prayers from thence, when she considered the power of their adversaries: after all continues in a sad silence, until more then hopes of the Queens assistance, transported both their thoughts again to be confident of fruition, without danger or inconvenience. And thus these two mournful, though sometimes comforted Lovers, would often spin out the tedious hours of the Night without rest, much less sleep, till Phoebus himself was forced to give them warning to depart, who like valiant Champions made good the Field, until the uttermost minute, notwithstanding their careful servants divers times, sounded the Retreat for fear of a Surprize, But however they endeavoured in this manner, to enjoy some part of their loves, like people in a Barren Countrey, that beheld afar off a Fruitful Island, and could not get to it, by reason of the interposition of the Sea, though something delighted with the sight onely, yet crafty Philostros that had alwayes his eyes open to those designs he had a minde to compass, quickly became informed of their nightly meetings, and almost as soon carried the discovery to his Masters intelligence; wherein he alledged, that the Queen her self was the principal instrument, that procured the young couple such frequent opportunities, and therefore with more care and violence, as he said, to be prevented, so that an Act presently past in the Councel, to have the Lady sent home to her own Friends, whereby she might be absolutely separated from Orestes courtships. Which suddenly being put in execution, it was a question whether amazement or despair plaid the greater part in the lovers bosoms; however, the Queen retaining yet her ancient courage, not onely sharply expostulated the business with the King her Son; but when she saw she could not prevail by any perswasion, gave private Counsel and Permission to Orestes to leave the Court, whereby to prosecute his Marriage with his Mistress Alciana in her own Countrey: This you may believe he wanted not diligence to execute, when the authority of a Mother complied with his own violent desires; so that secretly stealing to the Castle of Alciana , he instantly gave intelligence of the approaching Nuptials, by the invitation of all the Princes of her Kindred, to assemble at an appointed day, to be noble witnesses of the joyful Triumphs intended. But Philostros , finding himself likely to be out-stript by a womans wit, began to conjure up all the spirits of his politick brain for prevention, and fell upon an attempt to corrupt a certain intimate favourite belonging to Orestes , not onely with the promise of a great Dukedom in the Countrey of Syria , but also to bestow upon him a rich Heir in Marriage, the better to maintain the Title; These glorious baits, I say, so far prevailed in the Favourites ambitious and false nature, that he was content to sell his Master to buy the purchase; so that the two Lovers more open to Love, then watchful of Treason, the night before the intended Ceremonies should have been performed, being privately at their devotions in Venus Temple, according to the prescribed custom, they were both separate from one another by a selected company of Souldiers, sent to that purpose by Philostros , which suddenly carried Orestes from the sad sight of his most dearly beloved Alciana , who had onely opportunity left her to bewail her misfortune, whilst her betrothed Husband in the interim, was conveyed into a strong Fort, to be safely guarded until the Kings pleasure should be known, concerning the disposure of his person; however his unworthy favourite paid the deserved debt due to such a Treason; for although Philostros performed with him punctually the agreement, in giving him both the Dukedom and the Heir, yet the very day of his Nuptials, he caused him to lose his head for his reward. Nevertheless poor Orestes , neither received liberty from his imprisonment, or easement of his grief, which caused him for the most part to sit with his arms cross, looking up at the Heavens, as if he accused them for his sufferings, and his strained passions sometimes, would violently burst forth into imprecations both against his Brother and Philostros ; calling Orsames Tyrant, and his favourite, the center of deceit; from whose wickedness as he fancied, proceeded streams of disturbances, that drowned the whole world in confusion. Such discontented language did his distempers breathe forth; which however rather tired himself, then wounded his Enemies; whilst in the mean time, Philostros plaid with him like a huge Fish intangled with an Angle, too great suddenly to pull out of the water; letting him by degrees work himself out of breath, that at last he might deal with him according to his pleasure; since there is no better remedy against violent contention, then not to seem to strive with it, which renders it like an enlarged flame less furious: Even so it fared with this Prince, that having tired himself by his overmuch passion, seemingly at last came to so underhand a patience, that he appeared fitted for those impressions, which Philostros had a minde he should seal; and to that purpose imployed one Dion an ancient Nobleman of Syria , intrusted formerly by Orestes Father in many weighty imployments, to perswade him to pass such Acts, as his policy thought most convenient for Orsames security; which was publickly to disavow that private contract, made between him and Alciana , since the opinion every one had of that Marriage, gave not onely hopes of a new Posterity, but a certainty also of assistance by her Kindred upon all occasions. Wherefore one day this Dion watching the time when Orestes was in his best temper, and his thoughts appearing most calmed from extravagancies, entred into his Chamber with such a humility, as became the distances of their persons; and after a while spent in divers discourses, the better to disguise his intentions, he began with him in this manner. My Lord, said he, as it was my happiness, during the life of your admired Father, to be not onely witness of his glorious actions, but as a servant to his commands, spent my youthful years in the advancement of his fame; whereby he became lov'd at home, and fear'd abroad, and that settled this mighty Monarchy of Syria , before almost torn in pieces by Domestick Factions, in the high State of Felicity and Honour, he left it to your vertuous Brother, though an Infant under the Protection of your Mother; who enjoyed the Tuition, as long as the Laws of the Kingdom would give her leave to govern; however it hath not pleased the Gods as yet to bless him with Posterity; so that by all probability the Succession is like to fall upon you, if your own Actions do not divert and change the minds of those people you are to rule, either by discontenting your Brother, in that obedience you owe him as your Prince; or by giving the Subjects an opinion, you rather aim passionately at your own private pleasures, then their future good, in chusing a Wife of a strange Countrey, when you may have so many at home, as if you disdained the election, meerly because you were out of love with your own Countrey; especially when you know the Laws of Syria absolutely forbid, the Heir apparent to take a Consort, without the approbation of the King, which intirely absolves you from that contract between you and Alciana ; for which onely act you are now detained in prison, not onely to your own discontent, but to your Brothers displeasure, since he is about new Councels, how he may settle the Succession upon other pretenders, for that your stubbornness seems to render you uncapable of the Empire. Perhaps you will alledge that the Rules of Religion, command you inviolably to observe the sacred promise of Marriage, accorded between you two before the face of Heaven; unto which I must answer, That all compacts made in the prejudice of anothers right, are altogether to be esteemed invalid, of no force; and not to be persisted in without a double offence, the one to the party injur'd, and the other towards the Gods, who have expresly enjoyned the contrary; so that if at first you did commit a sin of disobedience to your Brothers will, by attempting to take a Wife without his consent, contrary to the known ordinances of Syria ; let at last your sudden repentance extenuate the offence, whereby you may be reconciled both to Heaven and Earth; lest the justice of the one, and the vengeance of the other overtake you. Again, whereas you may think, that the perfections of Alciana are not to be parallel'd, (which however is no sufficient plea to render you obstinate) I answer, that oftentimes our fancy out-does our judgement, which makes that become excellent in our sight, that we have onely brought our minde by some accident passionately to desire; and therefore will lay before you this consideration as a refuting example, whether you can possibly believe with a clear apprehension, that the small circle of Alciana's Body, can contain so much beauty, as the large extent of all Syria? In which compass you may be your own carver, with envious contention, who may be the happy object of your choice: With these words he ended his discourse, expecting his reply with a respectful silence; which presently brought forth many considerations in Orestes troubled bosome, and after some time these expressions. Must the Sacred Laws, by which our Souls are united in one before the Throne of Heaven, be thus abrogated by Humane Power? shall Policy triumph over Religion? and Kings exalt themselves above the Gods, not fearing to contend against their decrees? must Philostros wisdom be esteemed above Hymens rights? can pittiless man behold the perfections of Divine Alciana , and not melt into compassion? All which he uttered with other extravagancies of the like nature, which gave Dion a desire to take his leave for the present, hoping another time to finde him in a more moderate temper. But Orestes perceiving his intention, and reflecting in some sort upon the gravity of the person that gave him the advice; of a sudden took him by the hand, telling him it was not kindly done to leave him in his extremities, since there was a hope, as he said, after a little consideration, he might be wrought to credit any perswasion that was intended for his good, and would be the prosperity of Syria: This gave Dion so much satisfaction, that he not onely staid with him for the instant, endeavouring to fortifie his reasons with new arguments, but in a short while plying him continually with importunate solicitation, at last procured his absolute promise, to perform what acts his Brother should command him, to the disannulling of the former contract between him and Alciana . When Dion had gained thus much upon the Princes inconstancy, with this joyful conceived news, he went to congratulate the itching ears of the great favourite, that from time to time expected the issue, who esteemed it a most supreme dishonour, to have any of his plots fail in their success; and to this purpose a day was appointed soon after for a publick Assembly, who were to be witnesses to the whole Kingdome of Orestes intentions, to the content of many, but wonder of all, since the example was esteemed extraordinary, as the persons were eminent, which gave Orestes liberty to take his recreations where he pleased; so that one time walking under a row of orderly set Trees in a Park belonging to his Lodgings, being accompanied onely with his now more quieted thoughts, since his love Alciana began to be blotted out of his memory, by new considerations that entertained him, he was saluted by a youth, whose face appeared beautiful, as his looks innocent; onely a large patch upon the side of his cheek, with his hair carelesly covering a great great part of his forehead, rendered him by much less lovely, then nature seemed to have intended him; however, his eyes sparkled a kinde of perfection, that gave an admirable lustre to the rest of his obscured countenance, which again was augmented by the ruby of his lips. Orestes taken with the delight of the object, could not be but curious of the business, therefore with more attention he gave ear to his words; and the rather for that the boy told him, he had not onely a message, but a request to present unto him, if his patience or charity would give him the hearing, and with that wept, as if a sad story were the subject of his discourse. But after he had a little dryed his fair eyes with a handkerchief he carelesly held in his hand, he told him his name was Phalarius , an unfortunate Cousin of Alciana , since her late retirement into a Cloyster, had left him to the world to seek entertainment in his service, after having been robb'd and wounded by certain Thieves. Orestes hearing the name of his almost forgotten Alciana , seemed suddenly strucken with some fatal Omen, that accus'd him of perjury and ingratitude, for which deservedly he merited to be punished; wherefore he seated himself upon a Bench in those Walks, with his arms folded one within another, as if he meant to weave his thoughts an intricate labyrinth of discontent, his eyes being cast up to Heaven, as it were to penetrate the very bosom of the Gods, to be informed of the depth of his offence; thus he continued glasing his sight all the while, with the troubled water of his sorrowful tears, until the youth himself with the sadness of his contemplation, could not chuse but accompany his passion, with a few distilled drops of Christal, from his own beautiful eyes; and withal by way of interruption told him, that although he intended his preferment in his Suit, yet he was not so unmannerly, as to procure his vexation thereby, but rather if he thought his unworthy service, might prove any inconvenience to his more glorious imployments, he would most willing notwithstanding his Kinswomans kinde recommendation (whom he conceived had had some interest in his breast) desist from further prosecuting his intention, how profitable soever it might prove to his unfortunate condition. O uncharitable Phalarius , replied Orestes , be not so unjust, as to misconster my present passion, or to entertain the least sinister opinion in thy yet innocent bosome, that any desire, from the fair Alciana , can be less commanding to my grieved soul, then as a decree enjoyned me by the powerfull Heavens, which must not be disobeyed: No gentle boy, said he, I do not onely entertain thee, but constitute thee my dear and onely companion to talk nothing but Alciana , to liken every flower we can finde in our soft conversation to the several perfections of beauteous Alciana ; and when we have discours'd whole Summer dayes upon that delightful Theam, thou shalt gather them together in a gay Nosegay, and carry them to my Love, as Emblemes of her perfections and my constancy, informing her of all the sad postures poor Orestes undergoes for the absence of his dear Alciana ; nay, more, assure her, that the Sun shall sooner lose his light, then he the bright remembrance of that beauty, which onely captivates his heart; for death by the force of spightfull tyranny, may well separate our mortal bodies, but our pure souls shall ever live together united in the Heavens, triumphing over all humane injuries and violence. But Phalarius having obtain'd as he thought, what he came for, would not expostulate more with him the reasons of his passion; onely he desired to know if he had a desire to entertain him according to Alciana's request, whether it was not necessary to accommodate himself otherwise for his service, since he had some friends not far off, that he was assured would assist him to that purpose? No, already dear Phalarius , replyed Orestes , the commands of sweet Alciana work not upon so dull a Subject, as to admit of the least protraction; besides, thou must, said he, be a speedy and active messenger to divert her thoughts from that killing resolution of retirement, and by that means release Orestes from a world of torments, which he should suffer in being perpetually banished from the sweet conversation of his most dear Love: With this, taking the boy by the white hand, he led him into his own Lodgings, enforming every one that he was a near Kinsman to the Princess Alciana ; his passion not being able to hide that, which his discretion should have concealed, since his enemies wanted not suspicion, to keep over him still watchful spyes to observe his actions, knowing his determinations to be variable, as his nature was violent; in conclusion he made the dainty Ganymed not onely his daily play-fellow, but his night companion; which two seasons for the most part were spent in discourses concerning Alciana ; but the time approaching, for his publick negation of the contract between him and Alciana, Dion again was sent by Philostros , to put him in minde both of the hour and the circumstances; whereupon Orestes , contrary to his expectation, like an enraged Lion, fell upon him with this language. Thou wicked man, said he, doest thou believe, the Gods will suffer thee to go unpunished for this attempt? must the sacred Laws by which the two souls of Alciana and my self are united in one before the Throne of Heaven, be abrogated by Humane Power, as I formerly told thee; can that Devil Philostros , whose onely spirit thou art, retain in his uncompassionate breast, still constant intentions of this impiety? or will my unnatural Brother for ever punish me, and protect his malicious favourite without end, against right and reason? Is all Religion absolutely banished from every humane heart, and nothing succeeds but unconscionable interest and cruelty? cannot the benefits of my dead Father, or the sufferings of my dear Mother at all work thy nature to any pitty, and banish from thy pernicious thoughts, those malicious treasons, thou intendest against love and goodness? Wherefore I say, get thee out of my sight, or by the Gods I will make thee a quick Sacrifice to the infernal Furies. Dion had no need of any counsel at the present, to avoid these extravagant intemperances; however, with respect enough he took his leave, since his wisdom thought it better to temper his passion, then provoke his choler; and yet instantly he carried the news to Philostros , with the addition also of his opinion; that certainly it was the frequent conversation of the newly entertained Kinsman to Alciana , that altered the resolution of Orestes. Philostros considering this strange and sudden change, could not chuse but be of the same belief, and therefore called a Councel of his own private Friends, wherein after some consultation, with the approbation of the King, command was given to an Officer of the Court, with a strong guard to repair the next morning to the Princes Lodgings, there by force to separate him from his young favourite, and then to convey his person to some place of less liberty, where again he might be treated withal about his former promise; a judgement given as might be thought against all morality and pitty; but the support of a Crown will not be regulated by any compassion; tears being onely fit for the condition of a penitent, no way becoming the Dignity of an unthroned King, whose dazling glory must not behold the dark misfortune of any other condition. This resolution, I say, was put in execution with all expedition and vigour; for the Captain of the Guard, a man of a rough nature, having received his Commission, at the time appointed went up into the Chamber of Orestes , and finding him a bed, though his diligent servant Phalarius was newly risen from the warm sides of his dear Master, where he had reposed the night past; The Officer in a cold complement, shewed him the strict commission of the King his Brother, desiring him without resistance or delay, he would prepare himself to an absolute obedience, which else might turn to his greater prejudice. But Orestes , not taken with a dejected sorrow, though he too much apprehended the injury, presently flew out of his Bed, like some furious wilde Beast, that feared to be deprived of that Prey, which his own hunger had lately procured; and so seized upon his naked Sword, that lay near him on the Table, vowing to make that Weapon, the instrument of his just revenge, if he laid the least finger upon his dear Phalarius , with intention to separate him from his sight and conversation. The Captain, whose providence had before placed the Guard at the Stairs foot, to be ready at his command if there were occasion, suddenly called them to his assistance, who with all violence obeying the injunction, in an instant incompassed Orestes about, neither regarding his person, nor having respect to his naked condition, whilst in the mean time poor Phalarius altogether distracted, between love and fear, flew with all his power amongst the confused Weapons, to defend Orestes by his own hazzard, from the threatning and appearing danger; where presently he received a cruel wound in his tender sides, which soon discovered it self, by his sudden sinking to the ground, ready to pay his last duty to Nature, as his best Blood for a ransom, to redeem his Master from his Captivity. But Orestes notwithstanding was presently surprized, and led away out of his failing sight; which Phalarius beholding, more bemoaned then his own approaching destruction, blaming rather the injustice of the merciless Guard for oppressing Orestes , then for killing him. Anaxia the Queen finding this extraordinary oppression of her Son, and not being admitted to his Presence, to afford him any manner of relief or comfort, by her motherly conversation; as also conceiving her own person in some hazzard, by the example of such a violence, of a sudden making an escape from the Court, put her self into the protection of Sorastros King of Egypt , whose Empire seemed then to overtop the Syrian Monarchy ; which ingendred an ambitious enmity between the two mighty Princes, that afterward broke out into an open Warre: whilst in the mean time, Philostros having now Orestes at his absolute mercy, in having given his Brother Orsames too much suspicion by his late inconstancy, endeavoured again to make him subscribe to the divorcement of his pretended love Alciana , as well to debar him from a forreign alliance, that should give nourishment to any rebellion; as also to have the better conveniency to furnish him with some Wife of his own choosing, whom as he thought he might direct in the moderating of Orestes actions: Within a short time both these projects had so good success, that Orestes did not onely publickly disclaim from all interest in his former match, but was content to be ruled by his Brothers pleasure, in the election of a new Mistress; so that Philostros having by his diligent policies brought about his purposes to this contended issue, seemed to have the power of making the present for his choice, by reason of Orsames favour, since the youthful Prince, could not long be detained from entertaining his thoughts, with some Courtship or other; wherefore he resolved to design for this Service or Court Stratagem, one of his own Kindred, although he determined not to be seen himself in the action; by which means he supposed, he might become not onely the absolute Master of them both, but have another interest in the succession of the Crown, if Orsames should dye without Children; and the Fates seemed to favour his purpose, for at the same time, there lived at the Court a young Lady called Orbella , Sisters Daughter to Philostros , whose beauty and estimation, appeared in a manner to be parallels, for that her Uncles authority did but give her the one, as liberal nature had bestowed upon her the other; and both made way for the Princes Courtship, since, as he thought, it was the duty of every youthful spirit, to make love when the occasion was offered; so he believed his endeavour placed upon such an interest, was a subject could not but please Philostros in a high kinde, who now began to become his new Master, for that his own inconstancy, had made him forget his old Mistress. But however, witty Orbella , as well encouraged by her own excellent parts, as counselled by her Uncles admirable wisdom, received his Addresses, rather with a civil carelesness, then by a passionate acceptance, shewing in all her entertainments, as she knew him to be the Kings Brother, that commanded from her a reverence due to his Person, so she was in a manner certain of her own Vertues, that obliged her to keep his love at a distance: however, to pluck more eyes upon her self, she would daily adorn her natural handsomness with some quaint fashion, which her authority soon made a pattern to other Ladies of less estimation; by this means intending covertly the Prince might be more delighted with her beauty and handsomeness, since variety is the most pleasing object of humane sense; and the rather, when he should see every one admired her perfections; as I say, by these pretty cunnings Orestes at last became absolutely in love, whereas his first thoughts perhaps were onely to have a Mistriss to Court, since it was esteemed the chief business of the place, to exercise themselves with such imployments. And thus inconstant Orestes being again engaged in a new Labyrinth, Orbella plaid with his passions to her own commodity, according to her Uncles politick directions; sometimes inticing his love to a stronger confirmation, by a multitude of invented Oaths; and then again would bring him back into a kinde of despair, by her seeming neglect of all his protestation; telling him oftentimes in careless smiles, of his late Mistriss Alciana , who could not, as she said, but claim some prerogative in his affection, since not long ago he had shewed such violence in her behalf, insomuch as he was ready rather to have lost his Brother, and the whole Kingdom of Syria , then to be withdrawn from the constancy of his profession. Besides, she not seldom let him know, she could not be so foolish, as not to judge of the difference between her self and Alciana ; by reason of which she had more cause to doubt a dangerous surprize in his intention, then that he meant any way to make her the companion of his thoughts, since he had already quitted one so far beyond her in worth and beauty. Whereupon Orestes would reply, that as the Moon appears fair, until the Sun by his greater splendour darkens her light, so the beauties of Alciana was in some esteem in his apprehension, until he beheld Orbella's most admirable perfection, that obscured the others lustre; And as diversity of other stones, said he, seem rich at first sight to common beholders, not being fully instructed in their value, so when the Diamond is produced by the skilful Jeweller, with shame they are advertised of their own errour: So was it with me dear Orbella , said he, before I was acquainted with your excellencies, which now make me distinguish of the others wants. But Orbella had an intention to intangle him beyond disingagement, before he should receive from her, the least assurance of acceptance: To this purpose, one day when Orestes came to visit her in her Chamber, she not having stirr'd abroad, by reason of some small distemper a cold had procured her, or at leastwise so pretended by her cunning, in a reserv'd, though civil discourse, putting on a more solemn countenance then ordinary, she told him, that his Addresses appeared something scandalous to the eye of the World, as she was informed by many of her best friends, whose admonitions she was bound to observe, and since his quality and her condition could not suit together by way of Marriage, she desired he would demonstrate so much his regard towards her honour (which in Charity and Religion, as she said, he was obliged unto) as altogether to forbear her company, unless in those publick Assemblies, that could not be avoided; this she assur'd him was the noblest part of affection, he could use to a poor Maid, whose reputation was her principallest Dower, since she most esteemed it. Orestes hearing such a request, so much against his expectation and liking, told her, that as the Gods had set some disparity in their persons, by the fond opinion of the flattering world, yet that conceived distance, was abundantly supplied by the admirable perfections of her rich minde, in which she was to be valued before the greatest Empress: However my Lord, said Orbella , dressing her countenance with a deceiptful smile, whereby the better to colour her intention, although I might flatter my thoughts, with the seeming reality of your professions, and by that means, take all for granted, you say, yet certainly the King your Brother can never be brought to be of the same opinion, without whose consent, you know our loves will be to no purpose, since the strict Laws of Syria deny you to be your own chooser. Again, said he, is this unjust and tyrannical Law urg'd to my miserable disadvantage? No, Sir, said she, it is neither tyrannical nor unjust, but was wisely ordained at the first, to bridle the dangerous passions of such young Princes as your self, that might else marry to the prejudice, if not overthrow, of all Syria . I do not believe, said Orestes , that there was ever made such a Law; or if there were, I will have it blotted out to all Posterity, since it not onely proves an obstacle to my love, but is against the very constitution of the Heavens. No, no, my Lord, said she, you cannot; rather therefore endeavour to give your Brother satisfaction in your choice, who no doubt will provide better for your honour then your self; leaving these vain professions, which I know proceed but from the mouth of a youthful Courtier, that rather then want a Subject to work upon, would play with a Feather, or take a Baby for his Mistress; and with that offered to retire into her private Cabinet, telling him, she could not but be jealous of her own Modesty, in that she had been too long in private discourse with him. Orestes , although for the present he took his leave, yet being debarred, as he conceived the freedom of ordinary Addresses; however he noted alwayes in Orbella a carriage, that rather wisely endeavoured to avoid scandal, then demonstrated disaffection to his person, since she knew how to play her Cards to the best advantage; of a sudden, through the whole Court divulged his violent affection, swearing by all the Gods, he would dye if he enjoyed not Orbella for his Wife; but this soon came to the ears of crafty Philostros , who having, as he thought, absolutely intangled the wilde Beast he meant to take; one day drew Orestes aside in a certain Room, not onely near the Kings Lodgings, but where frequently he was accustomed to pass, to such recreations as daily he entertained himself withal, where he began to expostulate with him after this manner. My Lord, said he, as I have ever imployed my best endeavours for your Brothers service, and I vow by the immortal God also for your good, though perhaps otherwise interpreted by the false suggestions of others; so I beseech you, since there hath been lately an intire reconciliation between your self and me, you will not seek underhand, not onely to wound my Honour, and destroy my House, but absolutely to take from me my greatest happiness, your Brothers favour, by pretending love so preposterously or deceitfully to my poor Neece Orbella ; for as I know she is altogether unworthy to be your Wife, so of the other side, I must confess, I shall ever esteem her to be too good to be your Strumpet; therefore, I must intreat you, either to forbear your fantastical, and not credited Courtships, or I shall be forced to discover my thoughts to the King, who I hope will use his just authority to restrain you, as well as satisfie me; and with that held his peace, earnestly looking him in the face, as if the business required a speedy reply. But poor Orestes , thus unawares surprised by the wise favourite, knew not what answer to make; yet at last breaking out into many extravagant protestations, the King, according to his use, came that way, as they were earnestly discoursing together, who finding that rather passion spake the language, then temper, would needs be informed of the difference, by which means Orestes new love came to his knowledge, so contrived of purpose by Philostros , that he might not appear himself to be the authour of his own design, supposing the issue would follow the intention, since the greatest difficulty appeared in the discovery; for that probably Orsames was easily to be perswaded, that it would seem too great a tyranny to deny his Brother his youthful affection in both his elections: which accordingly so succeeded, for Orestes violence so overprest his Brother, with the crafty instruments Philostros had set about the King, not appearing at all visible in the business, that Orsames was not onely soon won to his consent, but a solemn day was appointed for the Marriage Feast, to be performed with most glorious Ceremonies, according to the dignity of such eminent Nuptials, wherein the Kings Heir, and the Favourites hopes, were to play their parts upon the Stage of Syria to the wonder of all Asia . However, though seemingly these industrious preparations, drew on towards the joyful consummation, attended by the longing desires of the two Lovers, yet the destinies had a hidden determination, to raise an Obstacle against the Triumphs intended; for Prince Austratius , Brother to the wronged Alciana , not onely provoked by his own dishonour, but exasperated by his Sisters injuries, with a mighty Army entred suddenly the Confines of Syria , vowing to interrupt the joy, or revenge the injustice; and in that manner endeavoured with the fire of destruction, to light ominous Torches to the Bridal Feast, which were onely to be extinguished with Blood; so that of necessity, the Marriage was to be deferred, since the King in Person was resolved to stop the torrent of his threatning stream; besides, most of Alciana's Kindred were assembled in the Enterprize, to accompany Austratius in his valiant Design, conceiving themselves also interessed in the quarrel; which in honour could not dispence with Orestes absence, (although love seemed to plead, by all the gentle Laws of that Profession, his excuse) as also, from being a Commander in his Brothers Army. In this manner these two threatning Forces approached each other, delay seemed too passive a quality to be practised in either of their intentions, which soon brought them together to exercise their enraged spleens; that procured an encounter, no less horrid then courageous, since there contended revenge, shame, and valour, against oppression, policy, and power: however, in conclusion, poor Austratius , having beheld the slaughter, in a manner, of all his Souldiers, in defence of his Person, himself still fighting for his Sisters right, was taken Prisoner by his Enemies. But notwithstanding this glorious Victory, that seemed absolutely to cast the fair Orbella into Orestes bosom, and he prepared with the open armes of his imagination to embrace her; yet as he was at dinner one day in his Tent, encompassed about with multitudes of Nobility, he was suddenly saluted by a dainty Damsel, about the age of thirteen; who with a confident bashfulness not onely presented him a Letter, but told him she had also a Commission to wish him to read it aloud; which if he refused, she would publish the contents thereof, to his greater dishonour. Whereupon Orestes with a disdainful smile, to be so tutor'd by an innocent Girl, although he could not, but be a litle amazed at the adventure, in a kinde of hasty passion broke open the seal, and found the Lines speak this Language.  Orestes , Let is suffice, that the hand that wrote this Letter, pretends to as high a prerogative in Blood as thy self, though the name of the person be unsubscribed for some reasons; it is sufficient thou art the injurer, and I am ordained to be the revenger, unless thy valour defend thee from the punishment, by protecting thy self bravely against thy enemy; since I am an ominous messenger sent by the Heavens, to call thee to an account, concerning the injuries of wrong'd Alciana , whose dying soul was by accident breathed into my bosom, after she had made a large relation of her own sufferings, and thy perjuries: Whereupon I vow'd thy destruction, or my own; therefore prepare thy self to meet me the day after to morrow, ready armed, in the Island between the Town and the Army, where shall be no partiality in our Weapons, although cowardly thou mayest pretend it in our qualities: else thou wilt procure thy certain destruction, by some other Stratagem I shall invent, if thou refuse this equal way of trial prescribed thee, to thy eternal infamy. Farewell.  After that Orestes had read this strange and resolute Letter, in the presence of all the Company, who wondered at the accident; some with jeering smiles, and others with distracted looks, he retired into the innermost part of his Tents, with an intentention to ask counsel of his troubled thoughts, what answer he should make to the challenge; and fain he would have flattered himself, with reasons in the behalf of his approaching Marriage, to have denied or avoided the Combat, being stung with the sharpness of the injury he had done to the fair Alciana: but his Honour, as he believed, called him to a more noble resolution, especially since the summons was delivered him before the eyes of all the brave Spirits of Syria , who would have been glad of his least shew of want of courage, since their ambitions could not chuse but envy the dignity of his person, that so much out-shined theirs; wherefore, in a little space, he came out from his secret Chamber with this answer, That although the appearing distance of their qualities might serve, as a sufficient priviledge to make him deny what was so rashly demanded, yet his own eminent courage, as he said, could not dispence with the reason; and therefore was determined to meet his unknown enemy at the time appointed, where he made no doubt but to punish him for his bold attempt; and so conducting the little Virgin some way out of the bounds of his own Lodgings, with order she should be safely guarded through the Army, returned to make preparation for the appointed combat; where long he had not remained, but the King came in Person, to chide his Brother for undertaking so desperate an attempt without his licence; and withal laying his presens commands upon him, not to proceed further in the execution. But these blasts were too weak to shake the settled resolutions of Orestes , who chose rather to dye, fighting with an unknown enemy, then live disgrac'd among his intimate friends; so that, falling down upon his knees before his Brother, he desired him, either to suffer him to vindicate his own honour, since he had undertaken the combat, or he himself would be the anthour of his own destruction, to let the world see he was no coward; which at last forced the King to give way to his passions, though Philostros was very sorry to hazzard his Neeces happiness in so doubtful a contention. Although Orestes in heat of blood had consented, as I may say, rashly to fight with one whose name was not so much as known; however, he was supposed to be some Prince of Alciana's Kindred: yet being retired privately into his own secret Cabinet, and the dead of the night raising fancies in his fearful imagination, began to expostulate with himself after this manner. Is it possible the Gods can suffer me to scape unpunished for those injuries I have done to the more then wronged Alciana? much less can I hope for Victory in this unjust Combat: can her sweet soul look down from the skies with any eye of forgiveness, when she shall behold me shedding more Blood of her Noble Family? is it not sufficient that she already hath made her self an innocent Sacrifice to redeem part of my wickedness; but I must with new slaughter disquiet the rest she now deservedly enjoyes in the Heavens? O rather let me dye by mine own accursed hand, wherein I shall perform an act of justice, since I am onely he that hath offended, then hazzard the death of one who brings with him as little guilt as the dead Alciana . No, no, I will not be a mortal enemy to him, that professeth so absolute a friendship to my dear love; but rather confess my self twice overcome, both by his goodness and valour, so shall I appear to the world more just, though less fortunate: And for Orbella , with all her beauties and honours, I shall return again to her great Uncle, who can give her not onely protection, but dignity; whilst I will again wed my self to dead Alciana . These were the imaginations that entertained the thoughts of Orestes , during the solitary season of the night, until the chearful morning not onely gave his minde some courage, but brought into his Chamber the gallant Commanders of his Brothers Army; who breathed nothing into his sad soul but inflamed desire, and certain victory, that again something settled his dispairing thoughts: so that presently he gave order for his Arms; and whilst he was beholding divers of sundry sorts, Philostros , accompanied with many Officers of the Court, desired to speak a word privately with him: when all were retired but they two, he told him it was his Brothers pleasure, and his own advice, that he proceeded no further in this Combat, unless his adversary would discover his name, since it was judged an indignity to the Crown of Syria , for him to hazzard his person against an obscure enemy: to which the Prince hastily answered, with all his heart, so he would again receive the protection of his Neece Orbella , and his Brother suffer him to retire into some obscure place, where he might continually bewail his injury done to the dead Alciana . This answer you may be sure, was a sufficient bridle, to detain the Counsels of Philostros from more perswading Orsames against the Combat; since the issue as he believed would either produce the glorious Marriage of his Kinswoman, or the sudden and honourable death of Orestes , whereby he should be secured by his friendship, or out of fear of his inconstancy. The time being come for the meeting of the two Champions, Orestes was mounted upon a pyde Horse, which very lively represented, either the changeableness of his Disposition, or the variableness of his Fortune. His Armour was light skie-colour, painted over with an artificial shade, that was procured by the Suns Eclipse. His Caparisons were cut into the form of a beautiful Phenix, the Saddle forming the body as the two Wings figured out the sides, which were composed of several coloured Feathers, so that the Crupper making the Tail, the whold Bird seemed to flye as the Horse moved, bearing the armed Knight in the Air; and the Rains of the Bridle being nearly contrived into the likeness of flames, as it were kindled from the Bit (contrived of material resembling fire) seemed to aspire upwards with a consuming intention. In his Shield was painted a Ship tost upon a stormy Sea, onely set forth with this Motto, Still uncertain . But scarce had he entred the List, when at the other end appeared his Adversary in a white Armour, set forth with the Story of Theseus and Ariadne ; the Ornaments that covered his Horse were made into the form of a Cypres Grove: for his device he bore the Picture of Dido Queen of Carthage , crowned with a Willow Garland, without any Motto at all, but her name: six seeming Virgins carried those staves he meant to imploy in the Encounter, which not onely gave a delectable, but also a sad aspect to the whole company, since by the sight, both the innocency and injury of Alciana was described. But Orestes being taken with a new apprehension far above the other Spectators, before he began his course, in a soft trot rid towards his prepared enemy; who contrariwise seeing him coming, not having any minde to entertain his Addresses, retired almost as fast back; but finding his importunity was not so easily to be avoided, sent one of his little messengers to tell him, that if his intention was to use words before the Combat, he found not his disposition any way inclinable for discourse, wherefore desired him with courage to speak onely the language of the Sword, which, of the two, was more proper for the season. Orestes , having received this sharp reply, and being summoned by the Trumpets to the Encounter, quickly made his Spurs teach his Horse his duty, and in the course carried himself with so much force and dexterity, that at the first course he bore his adversary to the ground with the point of his Lance, who had either unfortunately or unskilfully mist his rest; yet the Knight appearing ashamed at the fall, presently started up, and with a kinde of flourishing bravery, drew out his Sword, telling him (though his much halting shewed his courage was better then his person) that notwithstanding the Gods flattered him with a seeming advantage, yet he should quickly finde by the sharpness of his Weapon, that his dissembling Fates did but smile him into destruction; for although he were on horseback, and his self on foot, that inequality should not defend him from the speedy punishment he merited, according to the request of dying Alciana . Truly, said Orestes , as I am extreamly unwilling to entertain the quarrel any further upon these terms; so of the other side, I could be very well content, to have laid down my own life as a ransom to have redeemed hers, by much more innocent false man, said the Knight, doest thou believe I can be won by thy dissimulation, to abstain from a just revenge, since thou hadst so much cruelty to torment her for onely loving thee; No, Traytor, said he, I hope the Gods are more righteous, then to suffer poor Alciana's wrongs to go unpunished, and thy wicked self live prosperously, triumphing over her destruction; which would be an example too pernicious, whereby the deceived world might be encouraged to the like crimes? I confess my fault, said Orestes , to the fair, vertuous, and injur'd Alciana , so the Combat may be left off bearing that title. Canst thou think, said the Knight, thy cowardliness shall buy off the deserved reward of thy villanies? be assured it shall not upon any condition. Orestes , not being able longer to bear the oppression of his words, hastily alighted from his Horse (scorning a partiality in honour) and soon made his Sword dispute the rest of the Argument; choler beginning to banish from his remembrance the wrongs of dead Alciana , though it was a debt which his Soul was bound to pay ever to her memory: This brought on so sharp a contention on both sides for a pretty space, that the Spectators entertained the prospect with some wonder, but more compassion; until the robustious fury of Orestes arm, had made many passages in the Armour of the strange Knight, for Wounds, if not Death it self to enter in at, that quickly varnisht the outside with the crimson tincture of his own Blood, to the sorrow of all the beholders; for however they wished Orestes victory, yet they could not desire the others slaughter; which the Prince also perceiving, desired him not obstinately to continue his own enemy, when his seeming adversary so much coveted his good; especially, as he said, since the quarrel was not personal, but accidental, containing anothers right, who could not be satisfied in the conquest; and with that courteously retired, with an intention to give him not onely breath, but redemption, yet had he scarce spoke the words, but the Knight with overmuch bleeding fell down in a sound; which caused Orestes to flye to him with the wings of pitty, where pulling off his Helmet, to give him some refreshing air, he suddenly discovered the countenance of his once dearly beloved servant Phalarius , thought formerly to be slain in his defence: Truly this was a sight so much beyond his expectation, that he stood like one wholly converted into the dead image of sorrow, being confounded so intirely with amazed grief, that it took from him all effects of compassion, not stirring from the place where he stood, but with his eyes onely, to give redress to that misfortune, which his unwilling hands had occasioned, and therefore sufferd the poor youth to lie still, weltring in his own blood, until the King and some of the rest of the company came in to congratulate his Victory. But finding dying Phalarius to be the subject of his Conquest, it quickly turned all their expected joyes, into an unexpressible sad contemplation, one looking upon another as if they had seen an horrid vision; till the beautiful youth, (though in that posture) opening his fainting eyes, and perceiving many about him, first casting them here and there feebly, to search out some object they desired, at last, with a voice that scarce had power to speak any thing but death, brought forth these sad words from his feeble tongue: I thank the Gods, said he, that afford me yet time, before I perpetually close my dying eyes from the Worlds light, to relate these few passages, whereby the constancy of my affection, and the truth of my unspotted Love, may appear at the best prospect: Then know, my Lord the King, and you my dear and onely Husband, that here lies before you the unfortunate, but more unworthy Alciana , though happy in this, that I am a willing sacrifice to expiate the sinnes of those that hindred my felicity; which my Lord Orestes , you will easily believe, when you shall be informed, that I did but borrow the name of Phalarius (since there is none such) to seek you out in Prison, where you were detained; when also you know I serv'd you diligently, according to my weak power; and in that manner, enjoyed your conversation chastly, beseeming the pureness of my entire Love, as your own knowledge can testifie, until the last fatal and deadly separation, when I received a wound in your defence, a testimony sufficient how well I desired to love you; however not mortal, as it then appeared; for one of the Guard repairing again into the Chamber, after you were departed, more compassionate perhaps then the rest, finding me ready to yield up my afflicted Soul into the hands of my Maker, presently conveyed me into your warm Bed, where I rested all that day, till towards night that there came to my assistance an old woman belonging to the Lodgings, who applied such remedies to my hurt, that in a short time I was able to transport my self from that habitation to another more obscure; where I remained (every one thinking me still amongst the vestal Nunns) until my Brother Austratius overthrow, assured me of the impossibility of enjoying you as my Husband; especially since I heard you had given away your Love to another Lady, though far more worthy then my self, yet altogether unlawful whilst I was living: so that I was determined to make an offering of my own life to redeem the offence, and by my death to set you free, that you might with all liberty enjoy your election, which you seemed to like better of; and therefore invited first that hand to kill me, (for truly I had no hope in the Victory) before it was given in Marriage to another; by that means dissolving the former contract, to render the second prosperous. Then turning her self to the King, she desired him to be so graciously good, as to suffer her Brother again to possess that Territory, which he had parted withal to purchase his ransome, since his loss proceeded onely from that natural affection which he bore her as his Sister. But by this time her short and panting Breath, gave evident signs to the whole company, that death summoned her to the last part she was to play in the Tragedy; wherefore, forcing her self a little against her almost consumed force, wherein love seemed to be most courageous; she lifted up her pale face, begging a kiss in that manner with her trembling lips, of her dear, yet unkinde Lord Orestes ; and after two or three deep sighs, which shewed how unwilling she was to leave him, yielded up her pure Soul to the purest Heavens, there to be made a Star for her Vertues, whilst every eye and heart was full of grief, as if the World had been already buried in her loss. Orestes , who for a long time had frozen himself to her dead body, of a sudden started up, as from his Grave, and with distracted looks, casting his eyes about him, at last fix'd his view upon his naked Sword that lay on the Grass, coloured yet with his Loves blood, to which object he flew with such violence, as if he meant to revenge her death by the destruction of all mankinde, since she chiefly deserved to live of all others: but finding no subject, more justly as he thought, meriting his passions, before any could prevent his intention, sheathed the naked Blade in his soft side, and presently fell down with the stroak; which accident quickly brought the care of the whole company to his assistance, having no leasure given them to mourn the sad fate of Alciana , since a nearer danger threatned them. However, the Gods, who either looked upon the succession of Syria , or Orestes repentance, hindred the stroak from proving mortal, by a fortunate slip of the Weapon, so that instantly being carried out of the Camp, to a more convenient place of rest, the Physicians quickly advertised the King, of the security of the wound; which gave a contented encouragement to all the Souldiers, to assist at the Funerals of poor Alciana , whose body was interred with all the sad solemnity the time would permit, in that very place where she lost her life; and afterward by Orsames command was erected to her memory, a stately Tomb over her Grave, which spake this Epitaph:  These Marble Piles upon the stop discover, The Silver Urn of an unhappy Lover; Since too much Love untimely caus'd her dye, Though want of Love now makes her bloodless lye. Heaven ty'd the Knot that did the arm provoke, And Earth would have unty'd what caus'd the Stroak. Yet Heaven was more just that brought her ill, Then Earth that striv'd for to preserve her still; Each did invite her to the Nuptial Tye, But both debarr'd her from Posterity. Also the Lady Orbella , hearing of this Tragedy, imagined her intended Marriage would not prove otherwise then ominous, since the prosecution thereof had produced such lamentable effects; and therefore of a sudden retired from the world among the vestal Nunns, in the City of Damascus , where she is resolved to imploy her youthful years (notwithstanding the strong invitation of her Uncle to the contrary) onely in Holy Devotion, to the general commendation of all Syria . But for Orestes , although he found a speedy remedy for his voluntary received wound, by the care and industry of the Kings Physicians, yet he could not so soon procure ease in his troubled thoughts for Alciana's death; and therefore in the first place, began freshly to importunate his Brother, to the accomplishment of her request, whereby Austrasins might again be settled in his ancient possessions: Nevertheless Philostros spightful counsels, prevailing against all other perswasions, and many other of the chief Nobility of Syria , having lost by the same oppression their hereditary Offices, which they enjoyed from their deserving Ancestors, occasioned new troubles in the Kingdom; for the Lords looking more upon Orestes probability, in being next Heir to the Crown, then Orsames Government, wanting Posterity to fortifie his Title, of a sudden raised Forces to joyne with their discontents, not onely to put them anew in possession of their Rights, but to contend with the Favourites greatness; alledging for their defence both the Queen Anaxia's banishment, and their own injuries; by which endeavours, I say, in a short while after, they led an Army into the Field, to try the fortune of a Battle with Orsames power; thinking it better to hazzard their heads in a doubtful issue, then to subjugate their honours to a certain ruine: But in short, being totally overcome in a bloody conflict, Orestes in Person was taken Prisoner, his Lieutenant General Beheaded, as a publick Example, and my self, with many others were forced to flye, to save our lives; which not onely gave a full period to the Designe, but occasioned my retirement into this private Habitation, where I have for some years lived, though in a low condition, since I prepare my thoughts against all the flattering hopes of return, as long as Philostros sits at the stern of Syria ; whose disposition I know to be implacable, as the King his Masters affection unchangeable, grounded upon these considerations, that as long as his Favourite is safe and powerful, himself with security may freely enjoy his own pleasures; and to that purpose hath lately granted Philostros a new guard, to defend his person from such dangers as his over great interest, and absolute bold execution, threaten; especially, since not onely the States of the Kingdom are highly offended against his pride, but the common people become exceedingly burdened by his taxations, besides, Sorastros King of Egypt (unto whose protection the old Queen Anaxia is fled for refuge) knows it is his principal design, absolutely to ruine his mighty Monarch, who therefore labours his destruction. And this Sir, said the Forrester, is the unfortunate story of my banishment, and others oppressions; in the relation of which, I fear me, I have too much presumed upon your patience; though I can the more easily excuse my presumption, for that the Chase yet affords no other entertainment: and with that rose up with an intention to finde out the Dogs; neither long had they traversed the Copses, ere their ears were advertised, that their Hounds hotly pursued again the almost lost Deer, that continued the sport until the night scarce gave them convenience to finde their way home. Cassianus thus being every day more and more delighted with this pleasant conversation, began by little and little to wean himself both from Court ambition, or desire of glory; and consequently thought not upon his solicitation for the restoration of his Countrey, hardly harbouring in his quiet bosom any appetite of revenge of his Fathers conceived injuries; and less reflected upon either the turbulent perswasions of factious Dimogoras , or the more gentle friendship of noble Eumenes: however now and then, he could not chuse but cast back his thoughts, upon the remembrance of the Princess Cloria ; notwithstanding in such a dark way, as lights are accustomed to appear in a thick mist, that could not ere long but be absolutely distinguished, when there was not desire enough in his intentions to give it nourishment. Wherefore, the better to continue his thought in these delights, he sold some few of his smaller Jewels, to furnish himself for a Forresters life; and also cut away much of his beautiful hair, to render his person more proper for the Woods; besides his felicity seemed to increase, not onely by the solitary conversation with the noble Huntsman, but also by the more knowing instruction of the holy Priest, which totally banisht out of his remembrance at last, the whole representation of Cloria's excellencies: In prosecution of this intention, one gentle morning, not being at all threatned by a lowring skie, Cassianus , accompanied onely by his own thoughts, that seemed altogether innocent, leading in his hand a dainty couple of Greyhounds, to be provided for any Chase that should accidentally present it self to his view, issued out into the green and flourishing Forrest; where long he had not entertained his expectation with the hopes of discovery of some Beast, that might breathe his nimble Dogs, but he perceived a Knight armed lying upon the ground, under the large protection of an old Oak, whilst his Lance rested by the side of the Tree. But Cassianus not being certain whether death or sleep gave him the posture, thought it an act of necessary charity, to be something inquisitive after the manner, if not occasion of his lying there, so that approaching at such a distance that the noise of his steps must needs be heard if he were alive, the party suddenly lifted up his head; with this Cassianus had a full view of his face, and by that countenance quickly knew him to be his friend Eumenes , whom he had left behinde him in the Court of Lydia , which caused him to start back with some violence, as if ashamed of himself to be discovered in that habit; or affraid that his companion should chide him for his late unkinde espace without his privity; however again, encouraged by his disguise, he made a stand, until Eumenes earnestly looking him in the face for a pretty space, at last with a deep sigh brought forth these words. Can Cassianus think that any dissimulation is of force to hinder the effects and power of perfect friendship, which hath eyes beyond the sollidst obstacle? No, no, Cassianus , said he, make a true confession of your fault, that you may receive speedy satisfaction. These words caused the Prince with trembling steps, like a sorrowful penitent to come nearer to his friend, until at last he seated himself by him with this language: O Eumenes , said he, it was love, onely tyrannical love, that deserves to bear the blame, and not poor and faithful Cassianus . This expression seemed as strange to Eumenes ears, as the alteration of his habit did to his eyes; and therefore conjured him by all the remaining friendship left in his bosom, to let him know more of his secrets, which was a spell of sufficient force to charm him to all the discovery of the hidden mystery, concerning his love to the fair Cloria , and his sudden departure from Euarchus Court. After that Eumenes had chid him for his omission towards himself, as also comforted him with some flattering hopes, whereby to awake his determinations to action tending to honour, since he knew otherwise it was impossible again to recover his lost Countrey of Iberia , he told him in a forc'd smile, that although he had poorly fled from his Mistress, yet she had shewed more courage, and was come in person to seek him out in his most private habitation. These words put Cassianus to a new amazement, until Eumenes in. Brief let him know, that the Queen being forced out of her repose, by the late troubles in Lydia since his departure, Cloria was come to accompany her Mother into Syria , both remaining for the present in the Temple within the Forrest; whereas himself, as he said, had travelled most part of the past night, without success to finde out a more convenient lodging for the wearied Ladies: This gave occasion to Cassianus to inform him presently of the Forresters house, a place (as he told him) most fit for their reception, in that the Master was a Nobleman of Syria , banished also by misfortune out of his own Countrey. Eumenes's content and satisfaction for the accomodation, would not permit them longer to expostulate the matter; onely it was resolved Cassianus should make use of his borrowed name of Cassia still, which he called himself by amongst the Inhabitants of the Forrest, for fear of further discovery; supposing the change of his apparel, and the shortness of his hair would obsure his person: With these determinations they went to finde out the sorrowful Queen, and her lovely Daughter, after their inconvenient rest. But Cassianus , although he had put on as strong a resolution, as his weak power would give him leave, absolutely to bury his former love in oblivion; yet when his eyes again beheld the admirable Princess, though onely drest with the sad cloathing of discontent, for her Mothers oppressions, he stood trembling, without being able to speak one single word, having no power to invite them to the Forresters house. Eumenes , who quickly perceived his disease, told the Queen, that that young Huntsman was come not onely to inform her, but to wait upon her to a more convenient habitation; which would appear the better, as he said, in regard of the inconvenience of the night past: The Queen, without any circumstances imbraced the offer, and went presently with her whole Train to take possession of the courtesie. The Lodge was seated upon a rising Hill, as if it had been ordained by nature to be the commanding fortress of those Woods, which most pleasantly encompassed it round about, as a watchful guard; yet leaving a large Plain of all sides, to shew they would not intrude too near, to be an inconvenience to the Dwelling; which circuit also was imployed to the best advantage, since most beautiful Gardens, with Fountains, afforded not onely delight, but added in a manner State to the Building; however it seemed contrived onely of purpose to avoid all ostentation, and purchase privacy. The Queen and the rest of the company, had not imployed much time in beholding that pretty delight, but the old Forrester himself, having been advertised by Cassianus , that went before to that purpose, of some noble guests which he was to entertain, though he was not at all informed of the persons, came out to meet them: as he prepared himself to give a complemental welcome, according to the courtesie of his nature, and the civility of his education, he was soon made certain of the Presence of the Queen of Lydia , for that her Picture (which he had in his house) lively represented her countenance to his memory; and not long after the Queen also came to understand, that he was her base Brother, driven out of Syria by the power of Philostros . As this unexpected encounter gave the Queen some consolation in her discontented voyage, so could not her Brother be but impatient to know her fortunes, the occasion appearing extraordinary, that brought her to this solitary place; however he thought it not manners to press her to the inconvenience of a relation, before he had settled her in her Chamber, where the fair Mantuina attended to do her service; who quickly brought in a curious banquet of her own preserving, to give her Aunt entertainment. After Hyacinthia had sufficiently refreshed her appetite, and the Princess Cloria was retired with Eumenes and the young Forrester Cassia , to take a view of those Gardens, which lay under her Mothers Chamber Window, the Queen being also descended into the Parlor, began the story of her own oppressions by Euarchus Subjects, with these circumstances. It is well known Brother, said she, that after Philostros had firmly established his own power, by the absolute favour of his Master Orsames , he by that means also, supprest the greatness of all the Nobility of Syria , who during the Kings infancy, had alwayes demanded conditions for themselves by force of Arms; and having now no more opposition in his own Countrey, resolved to contend with the mightiness of the Egyptian Monarchy. This, I may say, hath been one of the chief causes, that hath procured the King my Husbands disturbances, and so consequently my own voluntary retirement, at present; since the great Favourite, Philostros , finding he could not by any means work Euarchus from his constant resolution, of keeping inviolably those tyes of amity, that still continue between himself, and the State of Egypt (I being married, as was supposed, to that effect) became enflamed with a new spleen, against the quiet felicity we seemed to enjoy in Lydia ; and by consequence held it a necessary piece of policy, to disturb us in our peaceable government, whereby Sorastros might receive no assistance, either from our endeavour or power, if Euarchus at any time should be perswaded to such an intention, by those affected, as he thought, more to the Egyptians then to the Syrians: though truly, for my own part, I must ingeniously confess, for many years together, I laboured that breach Philostros desired; however without effect, since the King my Husband, esteemed it a safer point of honour, to maintain both love and correspondency with all his neighbouring Princes, then to have a needless enmity, for the ends onely of others; yet that which most aggravated the fear (if not malice) of Orsames Favourite, was, the coming into Lydia of Queen Anaxia my Mother, as was surmised, with certain conditions, not onely of a more strict unity between the two Crowns of Egypt and Lydia , but also with propositions of a match of our Daughter Cloria , with Prince Osirus ; by which means, he thought, the tye would become inviolable. These reasons, as we imagined, caused Philostros to countenance some of the Nobility of Myssia , not onely to have a more particular dependency upon the Crowns of Syria , but to become less regardful of their own Prince; and to demand some conditions advantageable to themselves of Euarchus , by force of arms; since he neither lived with them, as was pretended, nor could be drawn to make a Warre with the King of Armenia , in his Nephew Cassianus quarrel. Whilst businesses were agitating in this manner, one Dimogoras , an ancient Nobleman of Lydia , being not onely of a factious disposition, but extreamly befriended of the common sort of people, who for the most part have not patience, nor constancy, to remain long in one minde, taking advantage of Prince Cassianus coming to the Court of Lydia , as also of the discontents of Myssia , of a sudden began with all violence to cry out for an engagement with the King of Armenia ; whereby, as 'twas alledged, with more honour, to recover again the lost Countrey of Iberia . As these inflamations, I must tell you, prognosticated some alterations in our Kingdom of Lydia , which Euarchus had endeavoured for many years to detain in a quiet security, both out of his natural inclination to peace, as well as by the faithful counsel of one Pollinex ; so of the other side, of necessity, it could not but afford the King sufficient matter for his thoughts and considerations to work upon: To this purpose, he presently dispatched, not onely an Ambassadour of quality to Artaxis King of Armenia , seriously to expostulate with him, about the restoring of the Countrey of Iberia to his Nephew Prince Cassianus ; but also sent other messengers into Myssia , as well to temper, as to feel the dispositions of those people, since he had been advertised of disorders, if not rebellions already begun in that climate, which he thought would prove, of some troublesome (if not dangerous) consequence to his affairs, if not suddenly allayed and pacified, in regard the scituation of their habitations were not onely barren, but unaccessible in many places: in this posture jealousies continued, if not encreased, by a certain kinde of desperation of all sides, until the King himself in Person was constrained, with a Royal Army to march towards the Confines of Myssia , whereby in some visible way by his Presence, to terrifie those people, if it were possible to new Obedience, since neither his Messengers, nor Perswasions, had been able one jot to work upon their Natures or Loyalties; and the rather did he resolve to make this expedition, for that he understood, some of the Nobility had already sent a submission to Orsames my Brother; however Philostros , his Favourite, not long after conveyed the Letter to me in a Complement. But the Myssians , not appearing any thing sensible of their ingratitude, with the like seeming Resolutions prepared themselves to give the King Battle: whilst in the interim Euarchus , suspecting many of the Nobility of Lydia that were in his Army (though in person they appeared to attend his Command) were disaffected to the Cause, he tendered them an Oath of Fidelity, which they refusing, he appointed them either to be confined or retained in Prison: But that which seemed most strange in every mans apprehension was, that Dimogoras remained most resolute, notwithstanding to the Kings purposes against the Myssians ; though with what inward intention, I am not able to determine, since both before and after the Wars, he hath shewed himself most peevish and spightful in all our occasions. In fine, not to detain you too long, with the relation of many tedious circumstances, when Euarchus was ready to have given his disobedient Subjects the Myssians a total, if not dismal overthrow, by reason of the prerogative of his numbers and power; he not onely shuffled up, contrary to every ones expectation, certain conditions for their advantage; but granted them also liberty to appoint Commissioners for themselves, whereby with more deliberation to dispute their pretended grievances in Lydia . However these Ambassadours, instead of applying themselves to Euarchus , to finish the promised and begun Treaty, did of the contrary comply wholly with all the factious of Lydia ; which hath produced since the calling together of the great Councel of the Kingdom. But for that one Pollinex suffered by this Authority, who was a man of excellent Wit, Knowledge, and Courage, as well as his Tryal and Condemnation remarkable. I shall particularly mention the Passages. As it was well known, at what root the Senate of the Kingdom intended to strike, being thus assembled, without the good liking of the King, so Pollinex could not chuse but perceive the main mark they aimed at, was his destruction, as being the chief man, that would and durst give his Master any counsel of contradiction: yet, having belike an absolute confidence, either in his own innocency, or his Princes favour; withal, building perhaps too much upon his Eloquence and Parts, could not by any means be perswaded to quit the Kingdom; wherefore being presently apprehended, a Tribunal was erected for his condemnation; however the Senate intended to be both Judges and Accusers, though my Husband and my self were at the hearing, being desirous out of some kinde of curiosity, not onely to be satisfied concerning the Crimes of Pollinex , but to be witnesses of the prosecution. After the Prisoner was brought to the Bar, they wanted no force of Arguments, to render him seemingly guilty to the admiring people; who had been made already sufficiently prejudicate in their opinions, by those which thought to gain by his destruction: And for the Nobility, that seemed by the Laws of Lydia , to be his formal Judges (however in effect they durst but act what was dictated to them by the multitude) conceived his escape might prejudice their own fortunes; wherefore were partly resolved of their judgements beforehand, knowing as in some sort his nature was implacable, so would it be almost impossible to work him out of his Masters favour; these reasons enlarged the disputations to some weeks revolution with equal violence. But at last many of his Judges, whether convinced by the eloquence and powerfulness of his arguments, or whether perswaded to more indifferency, by some hope to enter into the Kings Favour; of a sudden not onely forbore any more to inforce their allegations, but in direct terms, either professed themselves his friends, or seemed openly to pretend, as they had been formerly induced to thoughts of his condemnation, by the cries of the people, and opinions of his crimes; so were both their hearts and consciences now altered toward his preservation, in regard of those reasonable and just defences, he had made for himself, publickly before the face of the multitude. Nevertheles, both Dimogoras and the rest of his faction, continued yet violent in their intended purposes, which was, not onely by this means, to pull Pollinex from the bosom of the King, but also to take away his life, least he might again mount into places of eminency, to their prejudice: yet doubting that by this way of trial, they should not possibly compass their ends, in that the Judges being onely of the Nobility, were divided in their opinions, resolved upon passing a Law in the Senate house for his condemnation. After they had totally declined the first manner of prosecution, it was not long before they put in execution the second, whereupon poor Pollinex was condemned to the slaughter; and not onely stood thus censured as a guilty person, without having liberty to speak for himself; but Euarchus was also constrained, by the cries and exclamations of the enraged people, to give his unwillingly consent to this unfortunate and cruel judgement, though long he disputed with his Flamins about it, who all perswaded him to the compliance, rather then hazzard his own Person and the Kingdoms ruine. Notwithstanding the King had condescended to these particulars, with an intention to give the strongest testimonies could any way be devised, towards the satisfying of the thoughts (if not rather the fancies) of his unbelieving Subjects; yet those of Dimogoras faction in the Seneate, perceiving the Kings unwillingless to this unexampled act of pretended justice, began to think, that if they could not also procure from his consent, a perpetual continuation of their own present power and authority by some Stratagem or other, their own heads might soon pay for the violence used against Pollinex ; wherefore it was conceived most necessary, whilst they seemed to govern the actions of the people, by their cries and clamours to fright Euarchus (or rather those about him) to some extraordinary compliance in this nature; and by this means to have the Assembly of the Senate, not at all to be determined by the ancient and known prerogative of the Crown, without their own allowance; which was almost no sooner demanded, but it was granted; the rather for that the propositions carried with them two fair Pretences: First, that the necessary Affairs of the Kingdom required such a concession, by reason of those Monies that had been borrowed for the payment of the Armies, and the defraying of the Souldiers expences. The second, in regard the King might at his pleasure, as was told him, deny the confirmation of any Law should be offered unto him, if he thought it either prejudicial to himself or people. With these suppositions, Euarchus was content to please his thoughts, and entertain his fancy; whilst on the other side Dimogoras and his Faction, did not onely extreamly rejoyce at the Victory, their Policy had gained over the Kings constancy, but began daily more and more to press upon his patience, with other inconvenient, and I may say, most unreasonable demands; insomuch as he was forced to tempt the Myssian Commissioners, with a promise to make good unto that Nation, all their own desires and pretensions, provided they would assist his present necessities, in the recovery of all those priviledges he had lately parted from, and lost in the Countrey of Lydia . This, I must tell you, seemed not onely to be agreed upon, but Euarchus himself in Person, made a Voyage presently into Myssia whereby the surer to confirm the Articles: when the King had thus performed, (they in the interim promising to him all Service and Fidelity) returned again joyfully into the Kingdom of Lydia , where he was received with some testimonies of love by the City of Sardis ; yet the Senate perceiving the King began to purchase some good opinion in the hearts of the better sort, put forth many Declarations, wherein they not onely taxed him with divers faults in his own disposition, but bitterly complained of his manner of Government: These they publickly presented unto him, fortified by the clamours and execrations of multitudes of the lowest sort of people. In these perplexities both my self and Euarchus remained for some moneths, finding that the Senate did not onely over-power all our endeavours, notwithstanding we desired to give all satisfaction we could to the common people; but the Myssians had deceived us in our expectations, although we had both their Promises and Oaths to the contrary: so that after my Mother was also banished out of Lydia , taking counsel of our best thoughts, since we had few about us we could intirely trust, we resolved, as the King intended to try another part of the Kingdom for his future safety and content, so my self would make use of my interest with Orsames in Syria , notwithstanding his great Favourite Philostros opposition, to see what assistance and relief, I could purchase for my Husband in his distresses against his own Subjects; with these words the tears stood in her fair eyes, that seemed to stop the rest of her discourse; however she put on such a countenance, that appeared more to disdain her Persecutors, then to bemoan her misfortunes. Candalus , for so was her Brother called, who with a respectful silence had heard out the Queens relation; reflecting in some sort by the related circumstances, upon his own oppressions, returned this answer: Madam, said he, although in a far less model I must behold my sufferings, since my condition was not capable of such losses as yours, yet when I consider a person can but lose all, as dark a night of unhappiness may be said to shut up his felicity, as is possible; which I alledge not any way to diminish the compassion that is due to your Person and Dignity, from all noble and generous Spirits; but to possess your thoughts, with some desire of a private life, if things succeed not according to your wishes in your Journey: And the rather in regard I may very probably doubt, the Favourite will not easily be withdrawn from any of his designs, by what perswasions soever, having a determination perchance to destroy the Lydian Monarchy; besides, I have often heard him say, that a popular State is most easie to be dealt withal by a politician, since it consisting of many Heads, some of the Rulers at all times, will be subject to the discovery of their privatest Councels, either by way of corruption in their dispositions, or want of secresie in their natures. However replied the Queen, the consequence of any Rebellion or change of Government in this nature, cannot be, but a most dangerous president to the Kingdom of Syria it self; especially, if both the Myssians and the Senate of Lydia , do joyn in such an unity, that they cannot be severed, by the interests or power of other Nations: for that, said Candalus, the Favourite imagineth, that as there will be continual Factions and Divisions among themselves, whereby upon all occasions they may be divided, notwithstanding any tye of friendship or agreement, so hath he laid, as he believeth, so perfect and strong a foundation in his own Countrey, that it is unpossible it should rebel at any time to his disadvantage; having not onely furnished all the fortified places, with plentiful Garrisons of his own Creatures, but by reason of the War he makes in every corner of Asia , he hath the commodity of divers Armies, alwayes ready at his command, to suppress any insurrection whatsoever: and the poorer the people are, according to his Maximes, the less capable of dangerous disorders; for that their discontents, shall rather produce distracted assemblies, then well designed or furnished Troops, having neither Money to pay their Souldiers, nor Captains to lead their Forces; so that of necessity if they rise, they must become contemptible sacrifices to his power and spleen, instead of easing of themselves by their contentions. 'Tis true Brother, answered the Queen, I make no doubt but Philostros hath these thoughts in his imagination; yet, methinks, he that pretends so much to the good and honour of Syria , should also consider, that I being a Childe of the House, and Married into Lydia , by the general consent of my Friends, ought not to be thus cast away; without either conditions observed, in regard of my Nuptials, or any consideration at all had of my Person: and the rather may I expect this justice I speak of, and am about to demand of Orsames or his Favourite, for that the disgrace will reflect upon the whole Nation of Syria , who will appear to the World, either unwilling, or not able to assist me in my necessities, it being a certain kinde of moral, if not religious duty, practised amongst the meanest families; much more is it to be expected, from the Dignity of Kings and Princes, that should be inflamed with the least suspicion or jealousie of dishonour. Madam, replied Candalus , however I might alledge from the nature and proceedings of Philostros , other pernicious Maximes of State Policy, used in the communication, and comportment of Princes in their Governments, as for example; that it is better to hazzard, if not sacrifice, a Daughter of the Royal House, then any way to lose or endanger the least good to the Kingdom; yet I shall desire you to believe, what I have spoke in this discourse, are but the Arguments of Statesmen; or rather you may interpret them my own Fancies, the better to settle your thoughts against unexpected accidents; so that I should think my wishes very fortunate, if your perswasion can prevail with your Brothers goodness, without the knowledge of his great Favourite, whereby it might procure you assistance, as my self freedom, to return into Syria , again to enjoy the conversation of my Friends, or at leastwise some allowance out of my own Estate; notwithstanding I am prepared as you see, to be contented with my present Fortune. By this time the Princess Cloria , and the rest of the company were come out of the Garden, from taking those pleasures, which the beauty of the place afforded; who prettily pressing to give her Mother an account of those rarities she had seen, absolutely put off the other serious discourses; for that every one was most willing to be so imployed, until Mantuina with an humble salutation informed her Father, that the Queens supper in another Room attended her pleasure; which being accommodated rather with exquisite neatness, then magnificent plenty, increased the opinion of that happy course of life, appearing free from ambition, though wanting no content that might satisfie temperance, however not fulfil pride. But the circumstance of the Feast being past, and every one retiring to their rest; Eumenes would needs accompany Cassia towards his Lodgings, that were in a Village not far off: Cassia was more willing to condescend to his friends trouble, because he was desirous to hear something more from him of his own departure from Lydia , and of the success of that Ambassadour which Euarchus had sent into Armenia , to treat about the restoration of his Countrey of Iberia ; yet the night being too far spent to make any long relations, without some suspicion of their former acquaintance, they resolved both the next morning to meet in the Forrest under the Tree, where the day before they found one another, as the most convenient place of communication and consultation. Cassia was the first that appeared, as it should seem most passionate in his desires; but Eumenes not being also over slothful, not long after gave him the meeting; where both seating themselves upon an old Root, which by nature was ordained fit for the conference, since it afforded them the conveniency, Eumenes began to discover unto him these particulars; however with a conjuration first, not to be moved with the relation: After, said he, that you had taken your flight from the Court of Lydia , for so I must call it, rather then a departure, since your Friends were not worthy to be of your Councel, the Ambassadour which Euarchus had sent into Armenia , to treat about the redelivery of your Countrey of Iberia , not onely returned, but brought with him a conditional restoration of your right; which was, that certain monies should be paid to Tygranes Duke of Colchis , and you to promise a firm obedience to the Crown of Armenia : But Dimogoras fearing that this seeming accord would prejudice the hopes of his imployment, began exceedingly to mutiny against the propositions, as dishonourable, since you were not to be established with all freedom; withal alledging, it were more justice in Euarchus , to bestow his Daughter upon you, being of her own Blood and Religion, then upon Osirus , who was alwayes known to be an enemy to the Worship of the Gods, according to the Rules of Lydia , as also to the State and Prosperity of the Kingdom it self; which makes me believe now I think upon it, that you thought him more worthy then my self, to be made acquainted with your private love, who else certainly could not have been inspired with those apprehensions. At which Cassianus began to blush, but Eumenes not willing to break off his relation by any diversion, told him, that his intention was onely to inform him, that he might know hereafter the better how to prosecute his affairs, and not to obraide him, whereby to put him into confusions; so then followed on his Discourse: Neither did Dimogoras , said he, make use of his own tongue, onely to blast the justice of the Kings intentions, but combined also with many Myssians about the Court, to reprove Euarchus manner of Government; besides they alledged that the Queen spent more in Masks and Dancings, then would maintain a Royal Army, by force of Arms to recover your lost Right: And for Anaxia they made the people believe, that by giving her noble entertainment in Lydia , the Kingdom was not onely exposed to the unrelenting spleen of Philostros, Orsames great Favourite, but to be feared, that horrid troubles would quickly fall upon the whole Countrey, since her person ever brought mischief and misfortune, wheresoever it went: with these exclamations, in a short space, they chased the poor Queen out of Lydia , again to seek an uncertain fortune, who onely desired a resting place for her aged Body, to spend the rest of her years in peace and security; but the Gods it should seem, willing to put an end to her miseries, have since taken her out of the world, to the example of all Greatness and Humane Glory, scarce leaving her sufficient to provide for her decent Funerals: However Dimogoras with the rest of his factious companions, seemed not yet satisfied, but continued still their turbulent practises; so that now they have not onely pluckt from Euarchus imperial Diadem, the chief Flowers that adorn it, which is regal Authority, but have by their violent proceedings also, driven out of the Kingdom Hyacinthia their Queen, either with intention, the more to please the powerful Favourite, or to prevent her from assisting the King by her Councels to defend his Kingly Authority. This, Cassianus , is the occasion of our present Journey into Syria , whereby if it be possible, to obtain some succours from Orsames power, to quallifie these threatning disorders, that promise little less then the ruine of the Prosperity of Lydia , whilst you in the mean time, seem to put on a resolution, to bury your thoughts in this contented course of life, neither reflecting upon the misery your affairs in part have produced, nor consider the Honour of your House, in recovering again by action your lost Patrimony: and with these words rested silent, as if he expected some satisfaction by his friends reply. After that Cassianus had onely signified his sorrow by a few sighs, and not many tears, he asked Eumenes what he would have him do? What would I have you do, said Eumenes? either prosecute your love to the fair Princess, if it be possible to be obtained; since Cloria's indignation, cannot be but exasperated against your Person, by reason of her Fathers suffering, as she may think by your means; or else, take upon you some brave resolution, to recover again your lost Countrey, which you have now a better opportunity then ever to obtain; for Orsames hath lately proclaimed open Warres against the King of Armenia , in the name of all the oppressed Princes, of which number I am sure you cannot but be esteemed one; and for the conveniency of both the designes, you may accompany us under your disguised habit into Syria , without any suspicion at all; as well to attempt the love of the Princess Cloria in the Journey, as to undertake the recovery of your Countrey when you are there, if you fail of the first. This proposition of Eumenes , extreamly pleased Cassianus ; so that again his hopes seemed to invite his endeavours to the execution; onely there appeared yet this difficulty, how he could easily part from the old Forrester, whom he had promised to accompany as long as he lived; and had to that purpose, by the sale of his Jewels, provided himself with all necessaries for such a determination. But Eumenes told him, that as that obstacle ought to be of too low a consideration for his thoughts, since his Birth and Fortunes required the highest resolutions, so of the other side, he could furnish him with a most warrantable pretext, in that yesternight, said he, the Queen being in discourse with her Brother, about his return into Syria , (which she promised, notwithstanding her own pressing occasions, to solicite with all diligence) you may undertake to be the Messenger, to bring him back an answer of the success; and by that means have the opportunity, not onely to be admitted into the Queens Train, but in the Journey be a daily attendant about your Mistresses Person. This was so far from not contenting Cassianus , that it almost ravisht his apprehensions; whereupon imbracing Eumenes , he told him, that notwithstanding his own ingratitude, he was ordained by the Gods to be the preserver of his Honour, if not the obtainer of his Felicity. Not many dayes after this discourse, when the Queen had refreshed her self sufficiently with her Brothers contented solitude; and that preparation was made of two good Ships at the next Sea Port, to carry her into Syria ; the one for her own Person, attended by her Ladies, and chief Train, the other for her Horses, with other Commodities for the Voyage; (in which latter however Eumenes and Cassianus chose to go, not onely because they would give the women the greater liberty, but also have the more opportunity for their own private discourses) they put to Sea, one gentle morning, when the Winde seemed most obedient to the intention, and Sailed all the day in such a peaceable Calm, as if Neptune meant to contribute his absolute protection, in conducting the Queen to Tyre , a Haven where she intended to disimbarke for Damascus ; however an hour before night, when the Sun scarce appeared above the Superficies of the Earth, the Windes as it should seem, inconstant to their former resolution, began first to quarrel with the Sails, as if they had been angry with their gallant bravery, for driving the Vessel with so quiet a Majesty, upon the smooth face of the Ocean; and then made Warre against the Waves, for subjugating themselves to such a burden; which not onely continued, but increased the trouble, until dark night gave warning to the Marriners, to take down the Tacklings from the Mast, lest violently they might be cast upon some of the Rocks, which they knew every where dispersed in those Seas; neither could they conveniently make use of their Anchors in the deep Waters: But the Storm increasing, not onely augmented the fear of the whole company, especially the women, who by their loud shrieks hardly gave opportunity to the workmen to perform their offices, according to the words of command, but also gave cause of doubt to the chief Pilots themselves, that understood more knowingly the danger: onely the Queen, whose thoughts seemed already drowned in a vast Sea of Discontent, scarce believed she could undergo a worse shipwrack; yet poor Cloria , whose innocency had never merited such a hazzard, could not chuse but complain inwardly of the cruelty, though her expressions were no other, then in a seeming pale and distracted silence, sometimes crying nevertheless, because she saw it generally practised; until the thunder and lightning in the night, increased the horrour of every ones expectation, discovering as it were by that unpleasant light, the greedy Waves, ready gaping with a devouring aspect, to swallow up all their hopes, which put them past an amazed fear, to a certain expectation of ruine: Wherefore the Priests were presently called to do sacrifice to the Gods, either to appease their fury, whereby they might be assisted here in the danger of their lives, or obtain their mercy in another world after their deaths; some in hope yet to escape from ruine; other of more pious thought speedily to be removed to a better habitation; and a third sort invocated without any confidence, but to be conformable to the custom; which however gave sufficient imployment to the whole Assembly for some hours, until by little and little, about the break of day, the Winds began something to abate of their furious rudeness, as if they had partly wearied themselves out of breath with their own violent combustion; then suddenly Aurora started out of her watry Couch, seemingly more early then ordinary, to chide the storm for being so over-bold in her absence, in disturbing the quiet felicity of so noble a company: This gave warning to her slothful Lover, not onely to attend his blushing Mistriss, but to aid her in her desire, again to command the Winds to their wonted Caves, onely to converse with Monsters, since they knew no better how to use their power, amongst people of a milder conversation: but in the interim sweet Cloria , with a Tincture more illustrious then the brightest Goddess, directed her eyes and hands to the Heavens, as a testimony of her gratitude for her preservation; which in a short time produced so perfect a Calm, that the Seas seemed with humility to beg pardon for their late agitation; and certainly had with such ease obtained it of the whole company, since every one was full of joy for the unexpected change, if of a sudden the miserable Wrack of the other Ship, had not appeared as a horrid spectacle; the Mast covered over with dead Bodies floating in one place; Trunks, and other Commodities swimming in others; Horses and Men half dead, striving with natural industry to keep the little life that yet remained in their Bodies to the last minute: some again upon broken Boards, had good fortune to save themselves on the sides of the approaching rocks; whilst a few were preserved by the hasty sending out of the long Boat to their assistance; though, amongst the number neither Cassia nor Eumenes appeared: but however this cause of sorrow troubled their hearts for a long season, especially the Queens, whose Noble Compassion could not but melt in some tears; yet the Marriners were hasty to conduct the Ship to a safe Harbour, since she was rendered for the present, altogether uncapable of a further Voyage, having neither Sails nor Mast; besides her being much beaten by the Storm; so that upon consultation, Cyprus was found to be the next convenient landing place, which caused them to direct their intentions to some commodius Port in that Island: wherefore, within six hours hard labour, by the industrious Marriners, they arrived in a little Haven, not many furlongs from the famous City of Salamine . The Duke hearing the news of the Queens falling upon that Coast, as also the occasion of her retirement out of Lydia , speedily prepared himself, not onely to give her a respectful Visit, beseeming her Quality, but some convenient consolation, in regard of her necessity; wherefore presently causing his own Palace to be accommodated for her Reception, with a Noble Train, went himself in Person to offer her the Welcome and Honour of Cyprus . The Queen understanding of the Dukes approach, thought it not at all fit, punctually to observe the circumstances appertaining unto her Dignity, since she was now rather to become a Suppliant, then to keep State, so went out of the house to give him the meeting; who quickly with a Courtly Humility, kissing her fair hand, told her, That although the Seas should have done reverence to her Quality, for which they deserved to be chastized, yet the Gods were abundantly propitious, to afford Cyprus , the happiness of her reception, by the others neglect; and for his own particular, he vow'd her his best service against her malicious Enemies. The Queen, after that she had returned the Duke a grateful thanks, in a bashful smile, told him, that as she could not blame the Seas, that was but a senseless creature, for any inconvenience she had suffered, since she found so much omission in the Subjects of her own Countrey; so of the other side, she esteemed the Winds had done her a favour, in driving her into a place where she found an intire nobleness. After the Duke had invited the Queen to Salamine , which she accepted within three dayes, because she was not prepared at the present for the Journey, both in regard of her losses at Sea, and her own, and peoples indisposition, by reason of the Storm, he took his leave, withal resolution at the time appointed, to meet her, with such a military Entertainment, as was fit for her Reception; and according to that determination, the morning before the Queen was to take her little, though solemn Journey, the Dukes Trumpets presented her with an early Salutation, which gave warning that their Lord was not far off, to perform the rest of the service; and being placed in a Chariot of Crimson Velvet, she was conducted through the peoples acclamations, toward the place designed for her abode; when, in the interim every ones eyes were cast upon the young Princess Cloria , seated at her Mothers Feet, resembling another Diana , with a Silver Bow in her hand, and a Garland of Flowers upon her Head; though another beauty invited also their looks, and something withdrew their intentions, which was lovely Narcissus , the Dukes Son, gallantly mounted, who with a brave company on horseback was come out of the Town, by his Fathers command, to honour the Shew. Narcissus appeared to be a beautiful Cupid , sent by the Gods to conquer the inferiour World, with the effects of Love: And Cloria resembled a Deity placed upon a Throne in the Heavens, above the reach of mortality to attempt: he looked like the Spring, adorned with variety of choicest Flowers; and she, as an illustrious morning breaking in the East, coloured by Aurora's blush. The people, with a transported delight, beheld the one; but with an amazement, seemed to adore the other: These objects, absolutely destroyed the other richness, designed for the Queens entertainment; for the multitude imployed all their hearts and hands, to invite a continuation of what their never to be wearied eyes saw before them, till the best part of the neglected Triumph, past away without being regarded. When these sweet creatures met one another, though with their looks onely, since the distance of their persons would afford them no greater a convenience: they pursued the Encounter with such an earnest attentiveness, as if the destinies had already determined an eternal simpathy in their hearts, not to be disunited by any earthly Power; however, the poor Girl presently blusht, although her innocency knew nothing wherefore; and Narcissus , appearing inflamed with that blush, instantly grew red; at which Cloria cast down her eyes, as if apprehending a fault in her too much confidence; whilst the youth, having suddenly lost the brightest part of his delight, approached nearer the Chariot; at which unexpected boldness, the Princess grew presently pale, fearing belike a publick Address. But he apprehending, with a sharp reverence, the Maids desire, not onely fell back from his determination, but also mingled himself with the rest of his company; which gave occasion to Cloria , to seek him continually with her looks, until their arrival at the Palace Gate, for some time interrupted the enquiry, though a greater conveniency brought them to a nearer neighbourhood: for whilst Narcissus Father led the Queen up the Stairs, he thought it his duty, as his Son, to offer the same service to the Daughter: wherefore taking her by the fair hand to perform the office, Cloria suddenly feeling the touch, which her modesty had scarce ever been acquainted with from any other person, with a quick violence pluckt it from him, and hid it in her Muff. He too much apprehending the action, had hardly power with trembling steps, to carry himself up into the room; yet, by that time having recovered some breath, and considering his last part of Courtship was to be played, since she was shortly to be inclosed in her Chamber from his sight, approached her ears with a few distracted complements, which she answered no otherwise then with a smile, and presently seemed to flie to the protection of her Mother, where she remained as in a fortress, free as she conceived from his importunities, until the Duke his Father took his leave of the Queen, that necessarily commanded also Narcissus from his tormenting delight, to wait upon his duty. But the poor Boy, not being able to bear the strong assaults of powerful Love, within a short time began to lose the beauty of his cheeks, and not long after fell into a most dangerous sickness; so that the Duke not knowing the secret cause of the violent distempers of his sweet Son, with grief and diligence assembled the best Physicians of those parts; however, all their knowledges were not of sufficient force, either to know the nature of his Disease, or to cure his violent Malady, which put the whole Court into an extream perplexity, as himself into a desperate sadness; the rather for that melancholly sighs, were the onely expressions which were used by love-sick Narcissus ; until one day the Princess Cloria coming into the Chamber with the Queen her Mother, charitably to visit her almost dead, though unknown Lover, and standing by his Bed-side, with tears also in her eyes, the Assembly quickly found, not onely an apparent change in his countenance, but the Doctors felt a violent alteration in his Pulse, which gave occasion of some discourse at the present, but of more enquiry afterward of the reason. Wherefore when the Queen with her fair Daughter were departed, and the rest of the company severed from their attendants, the Duke by the advice of some of the Physicians, began to fall upon a strict examination of his Son, and so far prest him to the discovery of his inward thoughts, that at last the youth not being able to shew much disobedience to his Father, though his bashful love a long time contended against his duty, revealed not onely the true cause of his passion, but the subject of his distempers: This gave the Dukes despairs some satisfaction, in that at least he conceived he had got a knowledge, whereby his Son might come to be recovered, though the remedy required to be applied with as much expedition, as the Disease seemed desperate in operation. Wherefore after he had comforted the Boy, with as many hopes as possibly he could, the better to keep up his courage, and so consequently to procure ease in his pain, that he might have the more force to resist the violence of his desire, as well as the likelier to dispose him for the cure, he retired himself into his own Chamber, there to consider with less interruption, what course was to be taken for the purpose he intended; which was to save his Sons life, in whom consisted all his felicity, since he had onely besides one Daughter, the fair Eretheria , who was not capable by reason of her Sex, to succeed to his honour and command, in the Island of Cyprus . First he laid before his consideration, the seeming impossibility of his Sons recovery, without the assurance of Cloria's affections, since the Physicians informed him, that the nature of love was of too violent a quality, to suffer any Medicine to operate, with effect in a sick Patient, unless that passion were either qualified or satisfied. Next he knew, that was not to be obtained, unless the Princess her self became the artist, which seemed to be a work of no small difficulty; these difficulties continued the Dukes thoughts in a perplexed labyrinth, sometimes considering his own disabilities to pretend to so high a match, since he was rather esteemed a Subject and Servant to the State of Cyprus , then an absolute Prince indeed, in his Power and Command; however of the other again he reflected upon his own worth, and upon the opinion the world had of his valour and riches; but that was scarce held competent in his imagination, when he considered the attempt he was to make, was not onely upon the primest beauty of all Asia , but he was to contend with the Honour and Glory of Syria and Lydia , who claimed an interest both in her Blood and Quality. Yet seeing for the present his assistance was necessary for the Queens Affairs, he resolved to make the demand; especially for that without it, his Son was sure to perish, which to his happiness was a perpetual night: with this determination he went instantly to the Queen Hyacinthia , carring with him a Souldiers Heart, but a Suppliants Countenance. After he had performed his accustomed Salutations, and entertained her with some ordinary Discourses, giving her a short account also of his Sons indisposition, being seated together by the Queens importunity in a Chair, he began his more serious proposition after this manner: Madam, said he, as I come not now altogether to pay those due Ceremonies, which appertain to the Dignity of your Majesty; so I must humbly intreat your goodness to excuse the necessity of my errand, since it is the violence of a youthful affection onely, that occasions it to my grief, as to your trouble: be pleased then to know, that being earnestly inquisitive to understand my Sons Disease, whose desperate condition requires present assistance, or brings speedy death, I used not onely the Art of the best Physicians of those parts, but imployed my whole Authority to examine his inward thoughts, finding by some signes, that much of his sickness proceeded from hidden discontents, since the variableness of his passions returned and abated according to accidents; which (not to detain you too long in a needless expectation of what I would discover, and after that intreat) is no other, then that Narcissus is in love with your fair Daughter the Princess Cloria , whom as I fear he must either enjoy as his right, or perpetually lose his other joyes in this world; for that as I am informed, there is no mean between possessing that admirable beauty, or marrying himself to the deformity of a dark Sepulcher: wherefore, as I cannot challenge so great an honour out of any hope of my own merit; so of the other side give me leave to profess, that all my fortunes, power and endeavours, shall be alwayes faithfully imployed in the service of your self and Husband, against the injuries of your disobedient Subjects. The Queen after she had heard this strange and unexpected discourse of the Duke, did not of the sudden well know what to answer; of the one side considering the high consequence of his request, as of the other, the great need she might have of his help; besides the present entertainment she received in his Countrey, with the desperate condition of his onely Son, fallen into the accidental misfortune by her own personal arrival in the Island of Cyprus: but having a pretty while pawsed upon a reply, not to be too rash in uttering that, which past she could not well recall, at last she returned him this answer, with a countenance that expressed fear, doubt, and affection: My Lord, said she, as the noble courtesies which you have been pleased to cast upon me in my necessities, with that humane consideration that all the world ought to have, of the deservings of your sweet Son, must needs stir up such a grateful pitty in my foul, that I shall endeavour all wayes possible to render you totally satisfied; so of the other side, I must beseech you without partiality to consider, that I am not onely a Wife, and so consequently under the obedience of my Husband, who cannot but expect to have at leastwise the knowledge of the dispose of his Daughter in Marriage, but am also going towards Orsames my Brother, to obtain from his Power an assistance in my pressing affairs, who certainly could not be but displeased, to have his Neece given away in the Journey without his privity; yet so far I am content to comply with your request, to let you see how grateful I desire to be, because the necessity of your Sons Disease may require some speedy remedy, as that my Daughter accompanied with her governess Roxana , shall frequently visit Narcissus , until by the opinion of his Physicians, he be clean out of danger; whilst in the mean time, we may have some opportunity, as well to consider as to solicit Orsames , and make Euarchus acquainted with your intentions; however, I judge the convenience more proper for both, when I shall my self in person go into Syria . The Duke being transported with graciousness of the Queens reply, not doubting but this liberty was sufficient, to recover a thousand new lives in his sick Son, took her fair hand, upon which he sealed his humble thankfulness, and withal vow'd himself a perpetual slave to her service; After he had staid some small time longer in her Chamber, as a circumstance belonging to his Courtship (though his desire flew with speedy wings to bear away the joyful news to Narcissus ) he took his leave, which not onely filled all the Court with confidence of his Sons recovery, but the wished effects quickly followed; for the youth reviving by these hopes, within ten dayes obtained his perfect health, to the absolute content of all Cyprus: The Princess Cloria beginning now also by that allowed familiarity, with the former impressions she had received, to taste the sweet apprehensions of her Lovers passions, though her innocent temper, could scarce be brought to the least discovery; one day with her governess (whilst her Mother was otherwise imployed) took occasion to take the pleasure of those Gardens, that lay not far off her own lodging; where plucking with her white hand many dainty Flowers, which that place plentifully afforded, when she came to that, that the Poets feigned the ancient Narcissus to be turned into, (inwardly interpreting it, as a perfect Emblem of her servants perfections) she read so fluent a Lecture upon the Theam, and with such an earnestness, that it was easie to be perceived, what subject her heart most delighted in; however Roxana understanding her meaning, had much ado to abstain from laughing, at the pretty expression of her affections; yet with difficulty she forbore any publication thereof, until she had fully ended her love discourse; and then the old woman, in a kinde of a serious smile beseeching her Highness, since she appeared, to be so mighty a scoller in those fictions of the Poets, she would so far instruct her ignorance, that she might also be made acquainted with the applications of the Story. But Cloria soon discovering by her governess feigned gravity, that she made request onely to jeer her, presently with the apprehension began to blush: At which Roxana laughed in good earnest; and that drove sweet Cloria absolutely out of countenance, insomuch as with a kinde of a gentle anger, mixt with an innocent shame, she wept; which certainly had drawn on a more dangerous quarrel between her and her governess, if a Messenger from the Queen, had not commanded Cloria to wait upon her Mother, to certain pleasures of hawking, prepared for her delight and recreation, that diverted for the present the contention. However love seemed now to triumph of his conquest, over these two excellent creatures; yet the spighful destinies would not with so much happiness, suffer them to enjoy the sweetness of their delightful conversation; for the Queen falling sick by reason of her late distempers at Sea, and the Duke being call'd away to his warlike imployment against the King of Egypt , these accidents separated their persons, though not their affections, to both their discontentments; for necessarily Narcissus must accompany his Father in the Journey: which kept the Princess Cloria some time after, as it were wedded to her own Lodgings, unless it were, as her duty invited her, to visit her Mother; pretending however, her retiredness proceeded from the Queens indisposition. But the Princess at last being altogether tired with keeping the house, one evening she call'd her governess to accompany her into the Fields, to take some taste of the fresh air; where long she had not spent that time, that she rendered altogether innocent; by her hurtless imployment, now and then plucking the beauties of nature, that appeared to put on a more chearful look, to be handled by such delicacy, (for though their wilde growth, afforded them not so much sweetness, as domestick Flowers, yet her pure breath seemed to supply that defect, as she carried them in her fair hand) before she encountered with a lovely Countrey Maid, bearing upon her arm a white Basket, covered with a whiter Cloth: The young Damsel at the sight of the Princess, not onely stood still in a trembling posture, as if her own bashfulness had a little distracted her, but withal caused her, to dress her countenance with such interchanges of red and white, that Cloria with a pretty smile at the Girls confusion, began to interrogate her of her name, friends, and business; unto which the Girl, after she had borrowed leave of her fears, by the Princess encouragement, told her, she was called Aminta , born of Countrey Parents not far off; and said, her business was to seek some good service; for that her Father being lately prest a Souldier for the Wars of Egypt , had left her to the world, to procure her own subsistance; with that wept, as if her necessities were yet more pressing then she was willing to express by words. Cloria , being wholly overcome by a noble passion, reflecting upon the youth and beauty of the Maid, accompanied with the fearful bashfulness of her demeanour, turned her felf presently to Roxana , and desired her, that she would be so charitable, as to entertain the Girl as a new servant, because without her Mothers approbation, as she said, she could not admit her to be one of her own attendants; which however Roxana for some time resisted, as being unwilling in a strange Countrey to burden her self with the augmentation of her Train; yet by the powerful importunity of the Princess, at last she dispenced so far with her rigid providence, as to admit of Aminta for one of her followers. This gave occasion to the Maid, presently to fall down upon her knees, whereby humbly to acknowledge the favour, at no less a rate then the preserving of her reputation, if not the saving of her life; since, as she confessed, she knew not what friends to flye to for succour or counsel: withal, uncovering the Basket that rested upon her arm, wherein was discovered variety of choice fruits, she presented them as a token of her service and gratitude to the fair Princess, beseeching her she would be pleased to accept of such dainties, as the place of her Fathers Habitation did afford; that however, as she said, might be enriched by her taste, to prove of a greater value then they seemed: then retiring again with so becomming a modesty, that the Court Breeding in the comely Maid, appeared onely to have put on a Countrey attire, which made them wonder at her behaviour, with an extraordinary delight. But the lateness of the evening gave Roxana warning to solicit Cloria to retire, left the falling of the dew, might either injure her health, or prejudice her complexion, which for the present afforded onely conveniency of discourse in the way, though the Princess afterward was never well, but when she had the Maid in her company: And this in time so increased her affection, that she made her in a manner her onely play-fellow; scarce delighting in any conversation but in young Aminta's , whose countenance and actions put on such a grave sadness and respective diligence; that as of one side, she seemed onely desirous to please her Mistress, so of the other, she appeared too serious for the worlds conversation: but the Princess, finding by Aminta's frequent sighs, that something more then a natural sadness, or a dutiful respect possessed her thoughts, she not onely oftentimes enquired of the cause of her grief, but narrowly look'd into the demeanour of her Governess, whose severity she might fear, had procured some discontent in her gentle bosome. Yet, being not able to extort from the Maid her self any confession, and also Roxana assuring her, that no hard usage of hers, caused her melancholly, Cloria one day resolved to try her uttermost skill, whereby to be informed of the secret mystery of Aminta's sad expressions; and the rather, for that her complexion seemed something to suffer in the concealment, or at leastwise so interpreted by her thoughts. Wherefore one day she commanding her to attend her person, into a certain walk near the house, where she was accustomed often to take her recreation, it being a place defended from the heat of the Sun, and the violence of the Windes, by the natural scituation of a pleasant Grove of Trees; the Princess being there arrived seated her self upon a little rising Bank, which art appeared to have raised for such a purpose, whilst in the mean time Aminta stood by her in respective attendance. But Cloria rather aiming at the execution of her intention, then the reverence of her servant, according to her usual custom, when no body was present, commanded her to those familiarities she was most delighted withal, which was to sit down by her, since youth is better pleased with freedom in conversation, then state reservedness in actions. When she had thus placed her self, the Princess, without many circumstances in words, (for that her passion to be resolved, as it should seem, was too violent to be delayed) conjured her by her own duty, and that love she bore her, which if she proved over obstinate, as she said, might be lost, to discover unto her the cause of her sadness or grief, which her frequent sighs sufficiently exprest to be engrafted in her soul, proceeding from some hidden reason not yet revealed. Aminta by the Princes importunity, whose love and severity seemed prettily woven together, after a few tears mixt with many pauses, and two or three deep sighs, as if her tongue were afraid to become a traytor to her heart in the discovery, uttered these words. Most fair Princess, said she, let the Gods be onely blamed, if I am compelled to say, it is no other then your self that causeth my smart. Cloria , finding an answer so much against her expectation, and much more intention, could not chuse but look her full in the face, though with a kinde of silent reproof, as if she rather yet excused her own ignorance, then accused Aminta's suspicion; but the maid redoubling her words, like a fierce tyrant with multitude of blows, when he had his enemy at his mercy: Nay, said she, you have cruelly, as I fear, conspired my life; and which is worse, no Physick can be applied to my wounded Soul, but what remedies your self shall bring; like the Scorpion, that onely heals what hurt his Sting procured: Cloria being amazed at these expressions; Aminta , after some pause again, uttered this language, know dear Cloria , that Narcissus cannot live without the conversation of his admired and beloved Mistress, which onely hath caused this strange Metamorphosis before your eyes, to be turned to a more deadly form, if you cruelly deny the grace that I humbly require. By this rhetorick the Princess was sufficiently informed of her Patient: however, for some time she rested silent, until at last she desired to know how he could excuse his absence to his Father? Narcissus quickly answered, that pretending a Journey into Syria , to be better instructed in the fashions and customs of that Court, he had procured leave to travel for some while, though he intended to make no farther a Voyage, then to her beauteous self; in which school all excellency and content, as he said, was to be perfectly learned; then held his peace with such a begging look, that Cloria had scarce power to contradict, until with tears in her fair eyes, she after some small silence used these words. Dear Narcissus , said she, for so I must call you, in that you have endeavoured to merit that name at my hands; though I cannot but reprove the over-boldness of your attempt, since thereby it should seem, you have mis- interpreted all my favours; having so little respect to my honour, as that you have borrowed this false disguise, to satisfie your pretended passion, which the world will neither excuse in you, nor allow in me, if it be once known, how you were secretly entertained by my allowance, in the habit of a Countrey Maid: Yet to let you see how charitable I am, notwithstanding your transgression, I freely forgive the fault past, so you will now repent, and make satisfaction, in your returning speedily again from whence you came, not giving me further occasion to be jealous of my never yet suspected modesty; this being said, she ended with such a look, as shewed plainly she spake against the desires of her own heart. But Narcissus , who could put no less a difference between his admittance and denial, then a blest Paradice and a most unkinde and cruel banishment, told her, that if she had a will to destroy him, she might enjoyn that penance, since he was resolved to abstain from all natural food, unless he should be fed in her presence, by the sight of her perfections; and with that cast down his eyes with so sorrowful a look upon the ground, as if he sought nothing but a Grave, if he could not enjoy the life of her conversation. Cloria , after she had attentively beheld him, and then look'd up at the Heavens, as if from thence we expected supernatural assistance, and again rested silent, with abundance of tears gushing violently from her fair eyes, at last broke out into these imprecations: that if ever by any accident, his being with her in a disguised habit, came to be revealed to the knowledge of the world, she vowed by some means or other, to become her own executioner, as a bloody testimony of her absolute chaste intentions; in the mean time, she told him, to satisfie his pleasures, he was too cruel to exact from her such desperate conditions. Narcissus , scarce hearing what she said, being transported with such a joy, as religious men use to possess in extasies, not onely having broken through the discovery, but in being so beyond his hopes accepted, began to grow bold in his felicity, insomuch as he could not forbear, to imprint loves character upon her fair lips; until she in a grave disdain, to be so assaulted by his presumption, not onely commanded him in a severe look to keep at a farther distance, but withal told him, that he had already so exceedingly provoked her just anger, that it was capable to destroy those small sparkles of love, which charity had kindled in her compassionate bosom; and with that hastily rose from her seat, with such another blush, as inflamed Diana's bashful modesty, to become cruelly revengeful; which presently turned the youth into an immoveable posture, scarce knowing whether he breathed or no. The sudden coming of Roxana to seek the Princess, gave no time at all for expostulation, that absolutely left Narcissus to converse onely with his own despair, since she and her governess went presently to visit the sick Queen. However the Princess Cloria , though she used not those familiarities with her play fellow Aminta , (being over jealous of her own honour) as she was accustomed, yet she forbore not still to command her service upon all occasions, and with gentle smiles would often shew, she was not unrecoverably displeased with her, for her late passionate attempt, though she totally avoided her company in private; which was the reason that frequently she and Roxana , would walk to a certain cliff by the Sea side, where was a Grove of Cyprus Trees, that afforded a convenient shade, to protect their conversation from the Sun, or Winds violence; whilst in the mean time they might with what liberty they pleased, behold the Ships that entered the Haven not far off that place. And this delight, one day above the rest, not onely invited the Princess Cloria , in the cool of the day, to the accustomed recreation; but caused her to desire her governess, that she would hear her play of her Lute, to try whether by the occasion of her Journey, she had not for want of practice, lost that little skill she formerly had; which being accompanied by her excellent voice, that uttered this Ditty, in a manner ravished the old woman into a humour of Platonick Love, since her years were scarce capable of other heat:  Love to perfection doth aspire, When Lovers melt without a Fire; And purely joyn, Their Wills in one, All grosser actions to refine. Such contracts made as these, may be Esteem'd a blessed Unity, Since Hearts will kiss, In happiness, As by some influence Divine. Thus may we Court with Tongue and Eyes, And enterchange Delight in Smiles; Yet never own, Those Pleasures known, That Beasts as well as we may prize. For whilst we do but thus imbrace, The Beauties of a Minde or Face, We onely Woe, As Spirits doe, In Raptures more to Sympathize. If that two Lutes be Tun'd alike, As we the Strings of either strike, Every Ear Will quickly hear The other answer to the Sound. So Lovers should accorded be, By such a powerful Mystery, That never they, Should do or say, But what reciprocal were found. Roxana after the Song was ended, to shew she carried about with her, certain remnants of flesh and blood, fell in dispute with the Princess, about the idleness, as she termed it, of such a pretended passion, that seemed to make conversation, solely the period of Lovers desires, whereas nature requires as well a satisfaction of the Body, as the Minde: nor is that lawful pleasure denied mortals (as she said) by the pure heavens, that ordained man and woman to enjoy one another, to produce again creatures of the same kinde, to people and continue the world, which else would quickly perish. I said Cloria , but that love which you mention, which fixeth the pleasure in the body, is meerly bruitish, since the soul seemeth not to have the principal fruition; especially when there wants a sympathy in the contemplative part, that ought to render it divine: divine said Roxana , how can it be so termed? when it was instituted to procure humane effects, for else you might as well place your affections upon your Sister, as upon the Servant you love, who may perhaps equal him in all other respects, but in the Sex onely; and what serveth the diversity of the Sexes, but to perform those actions, which one of your own Sex cannot accomplish? Nay, put case, said Roxana , that you were fitted with a companion, that had all perfections in his soul, that might render your minde and conversation satisfied, yet if his body were either aged or deformed, I pray consider, what delight you would take in such society? It is true, said Cloria , because naturally we take pleasure in beauty, which would not appear in a person of that condition, and so consequently could not content the eye, that is a sense also curious to be satisfied. Why then Madam, said she, I will onely make this comparison, to confute all your forced arguments, so much against your conscience: Put case my Lord Narcissus , whom I know you love with all your heart, were by some miraculous decree, to be turned into a beautiful Maid, would not you be sorry in your soul for the conversion, although he retained still the same faculties in his minde, of wit, judgement, and goodness? With that Cloria blusht, yet not so much, because she found her self overcome, in that which toucht her to the quick, but because at the instant she reflected upon the Metamorphosis of Aminta , who so lively represented the comparison, although ignorantly alledged by the old woman: But what answer it would have produced, cannot be known, for they were both interrupted, by the sudden appearing, (contrary to their expectation, and to their no small amazement) of an unseemly company of Marriners, and Sea Souldiers, who as quickly (with a silent horrour and an unresistible power) seized the persons of Cloria and Roxana , and after some small circumstance, carried them into a little Ship- boat lying near the Shore, which as speedily as they could, they put from Land with long Poles, until they had set it free, as they conceived from all surprize of the neighbouring Island; during which interim, Cloria was too much overcome with fear and trembling, either to understand what they did, or to enquire what they meant, until she was sufficiently awakened out of her Trance by a more lamentable object: for she might behold her poor governess, lying bound in a miserable posture at the lower end of the Boat, ready as she heard by their discourses, to be suddenly flung over-board, because as they pretended, they were unwilling to burden themselves, with an unnecessary incumbrance, not daring to put to Land again to set her on Shore, for fear of being apprehended; besides they were in doubt, if she should be returned to the Island, she might be a means of their pursuit in discovering their robbery. Wherefore Cloria , without any regard at all of her Dignity, or care of those dainty limbs that were natures perfect workmanship, flew suddenly from the place where she was, as if her abundant compassion, had made her altogether insensible of her present misfortune; and violently breaking through the ring of those people, which stood about one that seemed by his gesture, but not by his apparel, to be in more authority then the rest, and casting her self upon her knees, with many tears uttered this language. If ever you tasted the Milk of Woman towards your education? if ever you honoured that Sex for your Mothers sake that bare you? if you can be less cruel to humanity because your selves live? or if you intend the Gods shall ever shew mercy unto you in this world or in the next, leave off your barbarous resolution against this aged woman, whom nature her self without more violence, must needs e're long destroy: but if your harsh dispositions cannot be mollified, by a Virgins prayers, let me first be sacrificed, that mine eyes may not behold the wretched destruction of my dear foster-mother, who from my infancy hath brought me up with respectful love, having often preserved me from many dangers by her diligent care. And this being said, she poured forth a shower of tears, as a charitable testimony that her heart accompanied her words in the request, The barbarous Judge of Roxana's life, seeing himself intreated by so sweet an Advocate, and with a humility answerable to his own rude pride, which rather mollified his Tygers bosom, then perswaded his reason to become humane, after some pawse in imperious words bid her rise; then having consulted with the rest of his companions, he told her, that her suit was granted, so far as to have a reprieve for her governess, until they were both presented unto the Admiral of their Fleet, who lay not at any great distance from that place, expecting their speedy return, which would determine as he said his own Commission, since he was onely put in command, to execute the service he had already performed; and with that gave direction to have the Boat hasted to the Ships, which was accomplished within an hours space, though before their arrival the Sun had already hid his face below the horizon, as if ashamed to behold so great a misfortune. The Princess Cloria was quickly brought into the Captains Cabin, where himself sitting upon his Bed, scarce rose to give her a civil salutation; however, she being more mindful of Roxana's danger, then of her own unhappiness, presently begg'd the life and releasement of her governess; which gave an occasion to the proud Admiral, not onely something to compassionate her earnestness, but to be more inflamed with her beauty; and these thoughts continued him some time in a silent muse, until of a sudden he brake out into this language: Is it possible the earth can produce such becomming perfections in sorrow? and with that presently commanded, not onely the old woman to be absolutely released from her bonds, but to be forthwith returned to accompany her Mistress, where he left them both in his own Lodging, whilst himself went to give some necessary order in the Ships. Cloria , although she was something satisfied, to have again the conversation of her governess, whom she esteemed almost lost, yet (considering the miserable estate she was in, to be under the power of such a barbarous captivity; separated in this violent way from the protection of her dear Mother, who could not as she conceived, but almost dye with sorrow and grief, when she should either be advertised of the particulars of her misfortune, or not know what was become of her;) began this complaint: Alas Cloria , said she, what have been thy offences to the immortal Gods, to plunge thee in these exquisite miseries, not possible in a manner to be suffered by humane nature? was it not sufficient to be separated from thy Father and Countrey, wherein thou enjoyedst both safety and honour, being condemned as it were in the company of thy Mother, to a voluntary banishment, rather then endure the affronts of thy Fathers persecutors? but of a sudden to be deprived of that joy was onely left thee, and be cast into a power more cruel then Tygers, and more inhumane then wilde People? And with this wrung her delicate hands, with such expressions of passion, that Roxana was forced for some time to leave her own thoughts, whereby to apply remedies to her Mistress grief. Madam, said she, if the Gods could at any time be justly taxed for their permission of injuries upon innocents; certainly at this present they merit reproof beyond examle, since the wrong is done to so high a goodness as the world again can scarce parallel; but seeing their inscrutable decrees, are not to be searched into by weak mortality, without such a reverence as must onely pray for redress, it is far more available to our present condition, to consider with patience what is best to be done, then to seem rebellious to their wills, in not well suffering what cannot be otherwise prevented; which at leastwise may bring with it forgiveness of our sins, if not consolation of our punishments; since for the most part afflictions in this world, are onely sent us to correct our stubborn natures, making us more fit for the Gods mercies, and not absolutely to destroy us, by rendering us subjects for their severe justice: for truly, as I cannot believe, but that they have reserved for your goodness a particular protection; so of the other side, I am confident, that when the chastisement, or rather I may say the trial of your singular vertues, is past, the instruments of your present punishment, will be cast into the fire, and you not at all prejudiced by the suffering, unless you prove more obstinate, or impatient, then you should be. Besides, you ought to consider, you are Euarchus Daughter, a Princess of such excellent parentage and blood, that the least dejection of spirit, notwithstanding the greatest misfortune, would degenerate you from your birth and education; and yet no way lessen the misery of your captivity; though I would not have your quality come to the knowledge of these inhumane Pyrates, for augmenting the price of your redemption, since covetousness is the onely deity they serve, and the sole period of their pains; wherefore, I beseech you, to put off so much of your confused grief, that may preserve your health, and render you more capable of counsel, whereby we may the better study your safety, and both our freedoms: and with that took her in her arms, where she held her, until her loving endeavours had rockt her into a quiet slumber, which continued for most part of the night: by this Roxana had liberty in the mean time, the better to converse with her own wit and judgement, how to finde means for their speedy delivery: sometimes she thought, of presenting those Jewels they had concealed about them to the Admiral; then to dispatch speedily a Messenger into Cyprus , to give notice of their condition: But as the first seemed dangerous, by reason it would stir up greater appetites of further gain, in the covetous Captain, and never a whit the more secure their liberty; so the other as she thought, would never be granted by his suspicion, for fear of being discovered, and consequently pursued by some great Fleet: These things continued her thoughts, in a perplexed intricacy until the next night following, then Roxana began a little to close her eyes, being tired with too much care and watching, that she might suddenly perceive a woman, by the help of a burning Lamp, softly stealing into the Cabin, whose face spake beauty, though her looks pretended horrour; which accompanied with the uncouthness of the season, at leastwise so interpreted by her fearful apprehension, gave her sufficient cause of doubt of some ill intentions, either to her self or Cloria: But the party quickly finding by Roxana's countenance, a suspicion of her meaning, abruptly saluted her in this manner, after she had seated her self upon a little form, opposite to her Beds-head. Lady, said she, although you may put on wonder at my seeming preposterous approach, yet I should be sorry to procure your disturbance by my presence, since my intention is to do you acceptible service, though I am now designed to a worse end; but first you must understand my unhandsome story, for your more confidence: Then know, I am a Syrian born, and being, some years past in my Fathers house, a rich Merchant of Damascus , I fell in love with a Gentleman of the same Town, of no great Possessions; however, my passion continued so violent; that I was resolved, against the good will of all my Friends, to make him my Husband; in prosecution of which, without much circumstance, we watched an opportunity to crown our affections, by enjoying one another, before the Ceremonious Rights belonging to Sacred Marriage, were performed in Hymens Temple; which perhaps too much exasperated the Gods, and caused my misfortunes: For being careless to delude the watchful and spightful spies, of the House of my Father, one night when we least look'd for his presence, he was brought to be an eye witness of our imbracements; at which sight, my Lover being possessed with a desperate rage to be so surprized, suddenly leapt out of his naked Bed, to prevent his own apprehension, since the fact was no less then death in him, by the rigid and unkinde Laws of Syria ; but being stopt at the door, by my Fathers fury, he quickly flew to the protection of his Sword, that was not far off his unhappy reach; and seeing by no intreaty he could perswade passage, he made forcible way through my Fathers life, so escaped all their endeavours, by his present flight; which, as you may believe, was a sufficient torment to my perplexed minde, for that every Ballad of the Town sung my shame, and my Lovers cruelty; and this quickly caused me to seek another Habitation, though the wealth that was left me, as being Heir, might in some sort have bought my quiet. With these thoughts I put to Sea, carrying along with me such moveables, as I could handsomely dispose of to that purpose, with an intention if it were possible, in this posture to finde out the abode of my banished Lover; or else, in some unknown place to set up the station of mine own rest. But my unhappy Fates, rather reflecting upon my former crime, then my present misery, never left persecuting me with contrary Windes and Storms, until they put me into the absolute possession of these merciless Pyrates, where ever since I have lived, the abused Strumpet of the Captains lust, though flattered alwayes, not onely with the hope, but promise of a speedy marriage; these protestations, continued me until now, reasonably well satisfied: but since your surprizal, you must know, he hath cast his burning affection upon the more rare beauty of the Princess Cloria , though he dares not openly own the love, because there is so strong a faction in the Ship against the Design; for that they put on a resolution to present the Lady to Osirus , the Kings Son of Egypt , whereby the better to procure their own pardons, for those robberies they have committed upon his Shore, having been in time past his natural Subjects: to this purpose, the better to compass, though to colour his desire, he hath imployed me as an instrument to your self, supposing you have an absolute interest with the Princess, to perswade her, by a disguise he will provide, to convey her self to morrow night, out of this Ship into another of more fidelity, which shall carry her to a Castle belonging to his command; from whence he vows, though untruly, she shall be returned safe to her Friends and Countrey; pretending he neither dares trust her, or himself, in the Egyptian power. But finding he hath an intention to deal false with me, after my dishonour, I have also deceived him, and made some of the contrary faction, acquainted with his passions; who will be sure to prevent his purposes, since they do not onely hate him, for his injustice towards themselves, in distributing unequally those booties, which have been from time to time gotten by Pyracy ; but now in seeking to hinder, by his private love, so fortunate an occasion to procure all their pardons. Scarce had she delivered thus much, but the Captain, like some furious wilde beast (having overheard her discourse, by a private whispering place, he had out of his own Lodging, into the other Cabin where Cloria rested) came into the Room with his Sword drawn, first killing the woman with his looks, and after forced the Weapon to perform the rest; which not onely suddenly awakened the sweet Princess, but with horrour of the spectacle, soon forced Roxana out of the Cabin with fearful shrieks, that presently with a confused distraction call'd up all the company in the Ship. In the mean time, whilst all of them were laying hold of such weapons as came next to their hands, to defend themselves against they knew not what danger, the Captain addrest him to the amazed Princess, in this language: Lady, said he, you see here plainly the force of your perfection that can remove any obstacle that doth oppose it; since the punishment of this treacherous woman, by my just hand, is a sufficient testimony of my truth and violent affection. But poor Cloria was so far from understanding what he meant, (apprehending also the horrid spectacle of the the dead body, which lay before her eyes) that instead of making him any reply tending to his satisfaction, she shewed him her naked breast, wishing him to dispatch her presently, that she might not undergo many torments by his cruelty. The Captain of the other side, being transported with that taking object, instantly flung away his Sword, and kneeling down by her Bed, as if he intended to sacrifice to some Deity, gently fixt a kiss, with his impure lips, upon that more then white Altar; continuing in that posture, until Roxana's cries had brought to the door many of the Pyrates; who, with a tumultuous noise, not onely entred, but finding the dead carcass of the slaughtered woman, and also the suspected demeanour of the Admiral, by reason of that information they had formerly received of the dead Strumpet, concerning his private love to the Princess Cloria , suddenly threatned him with this language: Villain, said they, was it not enough injustice in thee, to have oftentimes, by thy imperious commands, defrauded us of the equal distribution of such prizes we had gotten at Sea? but to endeavour also to deceive us of our hopes of our pardons, by the ravishment of the fair Princess, which is a present we intend to Osirus , to redeem our lives and liberties, and render us again possessours of our native Countrey, from whence we have been so long banished, under thy proud jurisdiction. The Captain, being not able to support this sharp reproof from his base Vassels, of a sudden leapt to his Sword that lay upon the ground; and when he had it in his hand, flew amongst them like a Tyger, calling to his aid such in the Ship as were faithful to his faction, which ere long procured a most bloody encounter; for what the Admirals party wanted in number, they supplied in courage, so that the fight a great while seemed to be equal; wherein the uncouthness of the season, added horrour to the slaughters, augmented also by the cryes of dying and wounded persons with the whistling of the Windes, that appeared to contend with the Seas in a new combat; but at last, the Captain himself being slain, a sudden despair seized the remaining company; insomuch as they all either fled to seek refuge into dark corners of the Ship, or yielded to the mercy of the Conquerours; who putting the Head of their late Lord upon a Spear, crying Liberty, shewed it to the people of the other Vessels, not far off; and presently sent a Messenger, not onely to inform them of their proceedings, and just judgement against their tyrannical Master, but to desire a conference, how they might best dispose of their Affairs to procure all their Pardons. During the conflict, the Princess Cloria , as it were transported beyond all degrees of amazement, rather conceived her self to be in a terrible dream, then the beholder of such inhumane actions, lay as it were without motion until Roxana , who had newly broke through the confused crowd, came into the Cabin to give her dear Lady some consolation. After she had a little driven away her fears, and comforted her hopes, with courageous language, she not onely recounted unto her all the particulars of the sight, and the occasion thereof, but informed her of the resolution of the Pyrates, which was, instantly to convey her into Egypt , and put her into the protection of Osirus . Cloria , when she had spent some time in tears, sighs, and silence, at last uttered these words: O Roxana , said she, we may perceive that the Gods are angry with us, and therefore the success of our fortunes cannot be but doubtful; however we may be delivered from this barbarous captivity, and committed into more noble hands; for I fear that Osirus will either never forget the injuries that have been done unto him, for the loss of his great Fleet upon the Ionian Shore, though my Father himself was betrayed to the Action; or forbear with violence to solicit his old proposed love, by my Grandmother Queen Anaxia ; which either must absolutely destroy my intentions to poor Narcissus , or put me in some desperate prevention; since his thoughts cannot be so low, as to suffer himself to be undervalued, by a captive, that, he hath in his power; upon which ground, I suppose the Pyrates have taken their resolutions. These were reasons sufficient to have converted Roxana , although she had been of another opinion; however, being more willing to apply balme, then corrasives, to the wound that was already made, onely returned her answers of hope, and not replies of despair to entertain her imagination, until the Thieves resolutions, within two dayes and a nights fail, the Windes seeming in the mean time to play with their intentions, had brought them safely into the River of Nilus , and so consequently soon landed them, with their rich Prize, at the City of Memphis , where Osirus the Prince then kept his Court. But the Heavens being not pleased that so valuable a Jewel, should be the price to buy the redemption of so vile offenders, the Pyrates were presently apprehended, and not onely in recompence of their many Robberies, but also of their late Murder committed, without form of Law upon their Captain, put to death with several torments, as an example of terrour to their imitators; whilst in the mean time the Princess Cloria , was with all honour conveyed to Lodgings prepared for her in the Castle. Yet one day, being alone with Roxana , and reflecting not onely upon the horrid danger she had past, when she was in the absolute power of the rude Pyrates; but considering what a heaven of felicity, her outward sense seemed to be acquainted withal, now she was in the glorious Palace of Osirus , King almost of all Africa , where every one appeared ready to comply with her pleasure, as she understood by the command of their great Master, she could not but with some pensiveness, think upon the sudden change of her fortune, for weighing the ticklishness of her own state, that had in so short a time, woven her thoughts and loves, into so many hopes and fears, it began to raise in her some doubt of her yet safety; and considering that the Egyptians had received too many affronts, to be heartily affected to the Lydians , she could interpret Osirus kindness but two wayes: either that he bore a noble minde, beyond example, notwithstanding her Countries seeming injuries; or else, that he had some underhand design to compass, which made him gild over his intentions with an outward humanity, whereby the better to obtain his ends, or render his revenge more terrible; which at last made her break through her silence, by this discourse to her Governess. What the Gods have determined of us Roxana , said she, their onely divine wisdomes must measure out in time, and we with patience and reverence are to attend the issue of their decrees; for if in any kinde they seem to smile upon our condition, we should entertain the blessings with a joyful humility, rather using them as necessary refreshments of humane nature, then esteeming them determinable substances of our absolute happiness; since pleasures here are neither perfect in their delights, nor certain in their continuance: so of the other side, if rough misfortunes at any time, overwhelm that calm which we covet, we ought piously to take them as deserved chastisements, to keep under the proud rebellions of our perverse nature (that else might swell to our perpetual destruction) sent rather to cure our diseases, then to encrease our maladies; and in this consideration, no doubt, we may safely walk, in all the various accidents of the inferiour world: however, though reason dictates to our understanding, this just and religious course, yet we cannot be without all natural and humane passion. Wherefore, as in the first place, with some joy we may consider Roxana , this unexpected change of entertainment, from a horrid captivity amongst Thieves, to a most civil honour in Osirus Court; for though the one had no cause, but gain, to make them our enemies; yet the other hath reason, by received injuries, not to be our friends: so of the other side, I must confess, an undigested lump of suspicion, seems to oppress my fearful thoughts, what may be the intention of our fates: though, I vow by the immortal Gods, rather to shew an exemplary hate upon my own life, then consent to give away that faith I have determined to absent Narcissus ; and with those words, a sweet showre of tears burst from the heaven of her eyes, capable to teach the earth a new beauty in sorrow, silently enriching her Handkerchief with the pearls that fell; which gave occasion to Roxana (after she had some time with a little seeming admiration weighed the discreet Rhetorick of the Princess) to return her this answer. Madam, said she, though I cannot believe the Gods have any other determination, then the absolute prosperity of your vertuous self, since they cannot place their benefits upon a more deserving subject; yet oftentimes they are pleased to mix their mercies with chastisements; not onely to reader us more capable of their favours, by possessing us with humble souls, but also by that means to make them taste better when we receive them to their honour. For as the Works of the Divine Creator are wonderful in their effects, so they ought to be grateful in their reception, since they proceed from an Omnipotent goodness; and if at any time they appear to us, either vain, or unjust, it is the ignorant indulgence of our own frailty, that makes us either falsly interpret them, or passionately wish them otherwise: for as humane nature loves it self best, and therefore consequently covets its own satisfaction, above all other things; so of the other side, the great God that made us onely for his Glory, will not admit of such a rebellion, in our thoughts and actions to be unpunished, much less to be rewarded; and therefore he puts oftentimes a stop to our idle desires, by a sharp restriction of our wills, when they swell beyond the bounds of duty and thankfulness towards him, that of nothing formed us, and can make us worse when he pleaseth; for the chief errour of our impatience is, that we take our selves more framed for our own sakes, then for his service; whereas, if we would imploy all our endeavours, towards the true end of our creation, we should neither miss of an absolute reward hereafter, nor undergo here the irksomness of perturbations; since the intention would enflame the minde to higher desires, then meerly flesh and blood can reach unto, that apprehend but present and sensual things. Nay further, if we do but truly consider, how little satisfactory the best of pleasure is, as you even now said (having neither any certainly in the enjoyment, nor perfect delight in the fruition) man would esteem himself no other then mad, so violently to hunt after worldly things; which Madam, I hope are arguments sufficient, both to confirm the former part of your discourse, and to disswade you to put in execution the latter, if accidents should make Warre against your vertue. But as her words were brought to this period, they were both informed, that Osirus was coming to visit the Princess; so that Cloria had no opportunity left her for reply, scarce for preparation to receive such a stranger. When Osirus entred the room, he made his aporoach in a formal garb, according to the Egyptian manner; his looks putting on Majesty, though his clothes Humility: and notwithstanding he used complements in his words, yet Cloria might finde by his language, he knew he was Lord of her liberty: withal intimating, that she received honour in being in the custody of so great a Prince; however, it was his desire, as he said, to make her in a kinde, not onely her own Gaoler, but his Mistress; and with that turned his eyes upon his followers, as if he expected an approbation by their applause; which gave Cloria some liberty to study for an answer, conceiving her thoughts absolutely necessary, since the subject of his discourse, so little pleased her fearful apprehension; wherefore after some time imployed in a trembling silence, with a humility answerable to that power he had over her person, she made him this reply. My Lord said she, although I cannot but thank my fortune, for having delivered me into so noble hands, where honour and vertue seem to be partners, in the making up an absolute greatness in your person; yet I must needs believe, liberty would have offered me much more cause of content, since it is a humane misery to be imprisoned, though it be in a golden Tower; for nothing endued with life and motion, but certainly covets a freedom in its own dispose, rather then to be captied at any rate; and especially man, that is inspired with a reasonable soul, whose apprehension is its greatest torment; and therefore delights not to be circumscribed by any power, how just or mighty soever. But since it is my destiny to fall under that misfortune, the world, I conceive could not have bestowed upon my condition, a more gracious and noble Lord; and in that onely I reckon my self an object of envy to other inferiour Captives, not doubting, but my continued usage, will not onely confirm me still in the same belief, but oblige me both with thanks, and prayers, to express my gratitude for so high a favour. This reply of the Princess so well pleased the vain humour of Osirus , (imagining, that although she understood not altogether his meaning, yet she had will enough to comply with his desire) that instantly he commanded all the company out of the Chamber; with an intention belike, to deliver his thoughts more freely unto her: but she, neither knowing what he intended, nor was ever accustomed to be left alone with strangers of a contrary sex, presently at the apprehension grew so pale, that it was easily perceived by Osirus , that her heart entertained some jealous fear of her honour: wherefore he caused Roxana to stay, not onely, as he said, to be a wished companion to her Mistress, but a faithful witness of his own actions: and then turning up his mouchato's, as a preamble to his discourse, as if he meant to gain by the posture a mightier esteem of his person in Cloria's opinion, converted his talk to her after this manner. Lady, said he, as the Gods can witness the truth of my affection, so the world can give sufficient testimony of my worth; and though, as Lord by my power, I might command, yet, as a slave, for your sake, I am content to beg: Beg (said he) O you heavens, that I should so descend! and smil'd scornfully with these words, as if he thought he had infinitely injured his greatness, by the Courtship; however, he went on with this language: Let it suffice, said he, that mighty Osirus loves the fairest Cloria , a beauty onely worthy of that love, that Queens have often covered with ambition. But scarce had he delivered thus much, when a Messenger in haste entred the Chamber, and told him, that young Philos, the Nephew of Philostros had lately given an absolute overthrow to the Egyptian Army, in a set Battle, and was now with expedition marching towards the Walls of Memphis ; which misfortune, as he said, not onely required his command for direction, but his valour for prevention, since the danger appeared too evident. Osirus , after some time of amazement, instead of consideration, after he had a little put off his own distractions, told Cloria , that these were but trifling Victories, to whet his invincible courage to a sharper revenge; and assured her, his next present should be Philos head laid at her feet, as the true witness of his valour, instead of a more proper Sacrifice to the prosperity of their future loves. And as he continued these rodomontodo's, he was intercepted by the whole assembly of the City, who informed him it was no time to be amorous, when Memphis was in apparent danger to be lost; which abruptly pluckt him away from his bragging Courtship, to the infinite content of poor Cloria , supposing her self by this means, freed from the plague of her thoughts; since she imagined this accident would give Osirus endeavours sufficient imployment, and hinder him from entertaining his fancies, with those desires she was resolved he should never enjoy. Yet Roxana , apprehending still a dark cloud of trouble to hang over their heads, by reason of Osirus seeming passion, or at least pretended love, after a grave silence, in reproof of Cloria's too much joy, gave her Mistresse advice in this sort, the better to prepare her against another encounter. Although this hateful Lover, said she, be a torment to your thoughts, and his expressions be no other then treasons against the love you bear Narcissus ; yet such is the necessity of the time, and the power of your captivity, that either you must force your will to comply with Osirus , if he prosecute his affections, or dissemble so far your intentions, as to give him some hope of your consent; for it is not to be doubted, but this Prince is as high in his pride, as mighty in his command, which may at last flye to a desperate requitall, if he should be any way scornfully rejected; since it is evident, his people have taken notice of his endeavours, not onely by the first proposition, which was the occasion of your Grandmothers Journey into Lydia , that so much exasperated your Fathers Subjects; but in his now intimation of his desires, before his Servants, with such extravagant vain glory; and how easie it is for him to have pretexts for any cruelty he shall use, may be considered in these particulars: First, for your Fathers disdainful refusing of his Aunt, after the Marriage was in a manner concluded; And lastly, the loss he sustained upon the Ionian Shore, by the destruction of the supposed invincible Fleet, he sent to reduce Cyprus again under his obedience. Wherefore be assured, if you disgrace him by an absolute refusal, he will strive to dishonour you by an equal violence, when both the object and the opportunity give him the occasion, not to be avoided by your industry; and love, when it is once converted into hate, by contrary accidents, procures for the most part, sad and dismal examples of revenge; since the passions, as they are most opposite, so are they equally violent, and one seeking to drive out another, cannot but produce strong operations, like the nature of Lightning or Earthquakes, that do not onely contend most forcibly against obstacles, but are ingendred meerly by dissentions amongst the Elements. Wherefore, my opinion is, that for the present you give way to the fury of his flames, if love be the occasion of his Courtship; which not being disdained, but gently tempered, may in time be qualified, especially when those great businesses he hath now in hand, shall draw away his thoughts to more necessary imployments. And if it be pride that swells up his resolutions to make you his Wife, because he will not be refused in any thing he shall demand, certainly the humour must not be resisted, until you have conveniency to free your self from his jurisdiction, which perhaps may quickly be effected by the issue of these Warres; in the mean time your humility and seeming estimation of his worth, will abate the vanity of those fumes, when it shall appear, by some dissembling complements you may use, you are so far off from contemning his offered affection, that you do not think your self worthy of the honour; however, you cannot want excuses to protract his hasty desires in requiring leasure, not onely to render you an absolute love of his person, as well as the admirer of his greatness; but also, to send to your friends, as a necessary circumstance belonging to your duty and modesty, whose consents you must not seem to doubt, since the alliance conduces so much to your advantage; however, the frantick people of Lydia seemed so stubbornly to oppose the first propositions: all which probably will satisfie him for the present, and win time, till either the siege constrain him to render you, with the Town into the hands of Orsames your Uncle; or the Gods by some other means, be mercifully pleased to provide conveniencies for your escape. However, Cloria was scarce contented with counsel, whereby to shew her self so great an hypocrite in her love; yet the War, in the mean time, took up the imployments of Osirus , that he had not leasure, or at leastwise will, to importune the Princess, to her no small satisfaction; for he endeavoured by frequent sallies to hinder the approaches of the enemy, which brought on ofttimes, most bloody and desperate encounters; wherein the particular valours of many brave Knights appeared to the worlds admiration: This not onely continued the Siege with a doubtfull expectation, but at last compelled Orsames in person to come with a new power to strengthen his party. Osirus , after he had valiantly defended the Town for some Moneths, resolved by a general sally, either to dislodge the Syrians from being so near a neighbour to the Walls, or to perish in the attempt; wherefore, one night, having before acquainted the chief Commanders with his design, and given a false Alarum to the Adversaries Camp, he issued out of the Town with most of the Nobility; in which posture he set upon Philostros quarters, with so much violence and courage, that he not onely committed a slaughter worthy of such a resolution, but had infallibly taken the favourite prisoner, if he had not been prevented by the valour of a Knight in white Armour, who defended his Tent with so much courage, that both his Forces were repulsed, and himself in danger to be slain, since he lost his Head-piece in the Conflict: which notwithstanding added Wings to the fierceness of the Fight; for both parties, enflamed with the desire of Victory, the one to make good the progress they had industriously made in the Syrian Army; and the other to regain what they had, as they conceived, shamefully lost, appeared desperate of their lives; the horrour was also increased by the darkness of the night, leaving no conveniency for defence; and this, in like manner became augmented by the accidental burning of Orsames Camp, in regard the Souldiers had no leasure to quench the Fire, for the hard imployment the Egyptians gave them. These accidents called forth, in a manner, the whole power of Memphis ; supposing the Siege had been finished, by the seeming success of their Party, leaving onely the women in the interim to guard the Walls: but Philostros , finding the desperate condition of the Kings Army, if a prevailing resistance were not made; when he had secured Orsames person by a strong Guard, he commanded upon pain of death, that no man should imploy his endeavours to extinguish the fire in the Camp, since, as he thought, it had been kindled by some Traytors in the Army, to give his Souldiers imployment, whilst the Enemy might become victorious; yet he promised them all reparation in their losses, after they had valiantly repulsed the Egyptians; who, as he said, were but a handful of men in comparison of Orsames powerful Army: with these words, and the assembly of many brave Troops to attend upon his person, he suddenly assailed Osirus , as it were triumphing in his success, insomuch as he was forced to give back, with a greater slaughter then was convenient for his purpose, or the defence of the Town, though he supposed that night to have made an end of the Siege; for finding that not onely his expectation was deceived, but his fortunes began to change, he caused the retreat to be founded, the rather because the approaching day, as he conceived, would endanger the loss of his whole Forces, since the Enemy far our numbred his power, having no disadvantage but the night season. Osirus , being again retired within the Walls of Memphis , and having taken a general Master of his people, by which he found himself uncapable of more sallies, he resolved from thence forward, onely to defend the Bulwarks with his best policy; whilst in the mean time, Orsames also fell to the spade: which not onely proved something tedious to many brave spirits of both sides, but gave occasion of divers private Combats, wherein were performed acts of Honour and Delight; though it was noised in the Town, the white Knight that had disarmed Osirus, appeared to be the most perfect Cavalier. The Princess Cloria , that had now a long time been happily freed from the unpleasant Courtship of Osirus , retired for her more delight one day into a private Gallery belonging to her own Lodgings, which was furnished with so many rare pieces that the diversity of objects could not but give imployment and recreation to the most dull eyes, much more to those that were beautified with so much natural curiosity as hers were: she had not before this had any knowledge of the place, being onely perswaded thither by the importunity of a seeming officious servant, that belike had onely the protection of the Room; who presently notwithstanding left her alone, to converse privately with her own delights. The first Picture proved a subject for her serious consideration, for it was the doleful representation of the Story of Philomela's ravishment, by her unnatural and cruel Brother-in-law; wherein she not onely with two or three sad sighs, seemed to compassionate the injured Lady; but with a little apprehension, reflected upon her own state, being also in the power of an inflamed Lover: whilst she remained, as it were, transported with diversity of thoughts, that were capable to disquiet the gentle bosom of a young Virgin, of a sudden she might hear one to unlock a certain secret door behinde her, which till then she had not perceived to be in that part of the Gallery; so that the fears that formerly had been ingendred in her imagination, by the pittiful object she beheld, encreased in her, being without any manner of company; and this gave her, as she believed, not onely cause to wish her self in her own Chamber, but to be absolutely suspicious of her present safety, since she knew not well where she was; though her terrour was grounded upon no other reason, then such as Children use to have when they go in the dark, imagining every noise to be some frightful thing. But long she had not expected the issue, in the mean time making haste to the door where she had entred, but she became distractedly satisfied, of what she most doubted; for Osirus appeared suddenly to her view, like some horrid vision, apparelled in black, that threatned by a confused apprehension, a sad Omen to her present condition; yet his habit was beset with divers Diamonds, resembling so many Stars, that endeavoured to give light to a dark Firmament. The Princess, as I said, thus surprised, by him she most feared, when she thought her self freest from all interruption, it was a question whether doubt or amazement laid strongest hold of her senses; though the last passion at length obtained the greater prerogative, by her too much consideration; so that she remained like Pigmalions beautiful Image, that wanted both life and motion: Thus fixed she stood, until Osirus (after some time of seeming admiration of her perfections, which he used as a fitting complement) began to make his addresses, as to a fair statue; but she, as it were, carried onely with a certain instinct of hatred, or at leastwise dislike, (since for the present she had lost her chief faculties of reason, that should have mannaged her comportment) strived as fast to retire backward, until his too hasty pursuit compelled her to make use of her dainty legs, to avoid his importunity; like the flying Daphne from Apollo , which for some space afforded a delightful spectacle, if any had been there to have beheld it, seeing the grave Prince with earnestness chase the fearful Lady; though he thought it a derogation to his dignity, to haste his steps much beyond the custom of his usual walk, for that it was the fashion of his Countrey, to seem moderate in every trivial affair; this was an occasion that the course lasted longer then ordinary, since, as he was determined, not to be wrought out of his pace, by the provocations of any passion: so was she constrained to enduce his leasure, for that all the doors of the room denied her passage to prevent his pursuit. In this manner they continued, until poor Cloria had lost that breath, that should have still defended her from being made a prey to his intended Courtship: but he now having her in his absolute possession, first arrested her by the fair hand, as a testimony he had a further commission to impart unto her, and then began to entertain her ears with amorous language, notwithstanding it was the worst charm he could use, to bring her within the compass of his Circle; wherefore, before he could utter many words upon that unwelcome theam (in witness, as he pretended, of his burning love) he might feel that curious hand, which in its right temper, seemed at every touch to melt into a thousand beauties, of a sudden became cold, like the coldest Ice; and such a shivering also he found to possess her fair body, that he thought it was high time to apply real remedies, rather then to continue vain professions. So that, presently taking her in his armes, almost distracted, between his own love and her danger, he never left tormenting her in that manner, until he had again brought her in some sort to her self, which made her look upon him with those two admirable lights, (though yet they had not recovered their former lustre) as if she accused his cruelty, for this last part of his care, in seeking to preserve her life, more then for the former act of her unjust imprisonment, since she conceived his intention was onely to reserve her for a worse end; and then presently shut them again, as if she both feared, and loathed his sight; withal uttering these words, that she hoped the Gods would yet protect her innocent honour against his wilde lust. But Osirus now having found out the secret of her disease, by her expression; to take from her all occasion of suspicion, he vow'd by all the Deities of Heaven, he had for the present no intention to use violence. Cloria , although she was now prettily well revived, since it was impossible for that extremity long to endure; and also something confident, that his intention at that time onely pretended to make love; yet not knowing perfectly how to construe his words, that seemed to imploy some reservation in his thoughts; besides, having been formerly instructed by Roxana's counsels, against any desperate denial, or discourteous language, thought best to comply at the present with his humour, for her better safety; and therefore gave him most humble thanks, for the assurance that her honour should be preserved by his goodness; which, as she said, was the most noble testimony of his love, he could use to a poor Virgin, now altogether under his powerful protection. Osirus , not onely joyful that he had recovered the Princess out of her swound, but proud that her words sounded love to his ears, imagining he had got an intire victory over her thoughts; however, some small bashfulness proceeded from her modest nature, which he liked the better, were obstacles to hinder open expressions, after the lively red began again to paint those more then fair cheeks, he took her by the hand, and led her softly to a Couch-chair at the upper end of the Gallery, there to repose her self until her distempers were absolutely over: When she was sat, and himself seated near her, he began to woe her with all his power, vowing her to be the onely Mistress of his thoughts, in the way of Marriage, though the stile of his language had the resemblance more of a commanding Emperour, then of a begging Lover; yet to turn the feared Tragedy, to a perfect Comedy, he suddenly rose from the place where he was, and pursued all her senses in so antick a manner, with his looks, professions, and actions, that it might have given sufficient cause of delight to Cloria , if her heart had been capable of the entertainment of any mirth; but it did not work from her countenance the least lovely smile, since her melancholly thoughts were laid asleep in the bed, both of an apprehended danger, and of a despairing sorrow, which cast a kinde of a black cloud over all her beauty, though it had not yet the power to obscure the fair feature of her face; but rather as a dark foil, seemed to give them lustre in the taking apprehension of Osirus ; but whether so or no perswaded, because himself was the chief occasion of the overmuch shadow, it might be a question difficult to determine; however he was absolutely convinced in his opinion, that the bright rayes of his own splendor, had sufficiently conquered the maids affection, which procured from him this discourse. Sweet Cloria (for so I must call you, said he, since my heart desires there, and in that name, to take up its principal habitation) although I intend to lay nothing to your charge, but my love; yet, to let you see the better your own obligations to me for it, I must wish you to consider the many injuries which the Egyptians have received from the disaffections of the Lydians ; not onely in the disrespectful refusal of our alliance, by your Father, in his marriage; but in regard of the unparallel'd loss of our great Fleet upon the Ionian Coast, when faithful assurance was given for its preservation. And lastly, the spightful entertainment of Queen Anaxia , by your people, when she came with propositions of a match between our selves; so that, if you should now also obstinately contradict my purposes, I might very well judge, you harboured the same hatred in your soul, against our illustrious house, since I am assured my person must needs merit your best affection; and with these words, knitting his brows, he walk'd two or three turns up and down the Room, sometimes setting both his hands upon his sides, and then again lifting up his mouchato's, with a furious gravity; insomuch as poor Cloria began again to tremble. But Osirus , perceiving her apprehensions troubled, quickly told her, she need not fear, since both her sex and his own love, were powerful protections to keep her safe, for the one, as he said, concerned his honour, as the other did his affection: yet, he let her know, that in requital of this good, he expected from her the speedy consent of a greater good, which was to be the Wife of mighty Osirus , for whose love the fairest and greatest Queens of the world had offered Kingdomes. Cloria , however she found the vanity of Osirus pride to transcend almost all belief, for which she the more disdained him inwardly; yet considering she was in the absolute power of one, whose passions might soon determine her fate, thought it the safest way, for the present, exactly to follow her Governesses direction, whereby to prevent the danger of her life, and honour more dear then that, notwithstanding his glorious professions, which her apprehensive nature durst not trust; and the rather, for that she conceived he did not mention his received injuries without some intention, either of fruition or revenge: Wherefore after a long pause, as if she borrowed leave of modesty to speak her bashful thoughts, she uttered these words. My Lord, said she, as a captive to your will, (which, however my fortune hath made me, and not my crime) it might appear a kinde of madness in me, to seem to resist your desire, much less to dispute those injuries that you say you have received from the Lydian State; especially, when I am invited to a free consent of Marriage in a noble way, by all the reasons that can promise me a happy condition hereafter; since there is such a concurrence of beauty, valour, and greatness, accompanied with so many other vertues in your admired person, to make you not onely Lord of me, but reverenced of all. But yet, for that the best affection is to be perswaded, and not compelled (otherwise it might prove prejudicial to your honour, in my seeming over-light) give me leave, so far to contend against your passion, that I may not yield without such circumstances as become a free election; and to that purpose, do desire some time of respite, whereby my Virgin modesty and knowing judgement, may play beseeming parts in the nuptials; otherwise to the eye of the world, it must needs appear forced, since it is to be supposed, you rather detain me as a prisoner, then like a Mistress; which also will ecclipse the glory of your name, as well as give me perpetual discontent, to esteem my self, no other then a ravished Wife, though Queen to so mighty a personage. Having said this much, she cast down her fair eyes upon the ground, and wept. Which posture, although it rendered Osirus almost a greater Captive then her self, yet it stirred up in him the very desire of a Tyrant, being loath to be limited, notwithstanding her bewitching entreaty; so that for some time he sat like the just (though rigid) Roman , when he was to pass the sentence of death upon his own Son, overcome by a more mastering passion, till at last, he gave his unwilling consent; and with it instantly took his leave, forgetting belike, by reason of his troubled joy, to prescribe some convenient space for her resolution. However, before his departure, to set up trophies of his own conceived victory, he imprinted a hated kiss upon her sweet lips, which she received no otherwise, then as some loathsome potion drunk, to avoid a dangerous disease. After that Osirus had thus absolutely quitted the Lodgings, to the Princess privacy, she began too seriously to reflect upon her own misfortunes, since the strength of her apprehension, drest all her considerations in mourning apparel: in the first place, she seemed most bitterly to accuse her self of ingratitude, to the dear love of deserving Narcissus , since like a coward, she durst not own it before the face of any power: next, in a manner, she curst her self, for having given any hope at all to the proud thoughts of her hateful Goaler, as she esteemed Osirus ; not knowing, by any means, how to winde her dissimulation out of the engagement; until at last, with the very imagination of what she had done, (although in truth she had done nothing) she was transported so much beyond all patience, that she seemed in a manner distracted, out of a certain jealousie, that she had yielded to some thing, that might destroy her former love, and oblige her to a second: yet she had so much incompassionate sense left, as to be her own cruel tormenter; sometimes tearing her Hair, and then again beating her Alabaster Breast, as if she meant to punish her self, for having but onely couzened Osirus vain imagination. But being altogether tyred with these diversities of passions, which again brought her to that temper, that she was in some kinde capable of profitable consideration, she began to gather up the scattered remnants of her torn attire, and by the help of a Glass there present, she a little accommodated her own discomposure, not out of any curiosity she desired to use towards her person, but onely to prevent the discovery of her discontents, not knowing how soon again she might be surprized. And thus, after she had performed what she thought was most necessary, to re-edifie what she had unframed by her violence, she went and sit down in the Chair, leaning her head over the back, with both her hands fastned upon her knee, whilst in the mean time her eyes were filled with tears, and her looks stedfastly fixed upwards, as if she implored the Heavens aid in her misfortunes: thus she remained, until Roxana , by the direction of Osirus servant, was brought into the Gallery, to accompany her Mistriss; which Cloria notwithstanding perceived not, till both the fellow was gone, and Roxana seeing her sad posture, approached to waken her out of her sadness, so that at last, by the importunity of two or three calls, the almost dead Princess seemed by a slow motion to take new life, like a young Phenix , after her Mothers obsequies; and when she had sent forth a couple of deep sighs, as assured messengers of her inward sorrow, being still prest by Roxana , to know the cause of her discontent (for she was an intire stranger to the encounter between her and Osirus ) she at last told her, she had been lately tormented by a hateful fury, and if by her wisdome she could not be dis-ingaged from the inchantment, she was afraid it had got so much possession of her person, that it must needs turn her resolutions to the forsaking of what she most affected, or absolutely destroy that life she was willing to preserve, because her friends wished it. This distracted language, and unusual looks, made Roxana the more eager to be satisfied. Wherefore, after Cloria had invited her to sit down by her, she informed her particularly of all the passages between her self and Osirus , yet vowing she would die a thousand deaths, rather then yield to his desire; withal, blaming her for having been the occasion of her dissimulation. However these passions drew from the old woman some tears; yet preferring a discreet remedy, before a fruitless compassion, she not onely soon dryed her eyes, but spake to her alter this manner: Most dear Lady and Mistris, said she, although I could be content to bewail the occasion that first wound you into this Labyrinth of difficulties, yet it were meerly ridiculous to lament that which is past, without attempting the means to be delivered from the mischief: Wherefore, before I proceed to councel (however I shall be content to take upon me what blame you please) I think it not amiss, a little to let you see your own errour, whereby you may be rendred more capable of advice; for yet your despairing thoughts take from you all probability of receiving other impressions, then impossibilities of prevention, which certainly will be the last and worst desperation, if tyrannical injustice absolutely prevail; though I am confident, the Gods will never permit so high an oppression, if you your self provoke not too much their wrath, by having less trust in their goodness, then you ought to have. In the first place, be pleased to consider, what greater inconvenience you now undergo, then if you had inflamed Osirus , by your peremptory denial? since the dangerous effects of that refusal, can but fall upon you, when all other wayes have been attempted, for your preservation and delivery; whereas now, you have not onely purchased time; that may produce happy accidents, but also by it you have convenient leasure to think upon many things for your benefit, that have not yet fallen, perhaps, within the compass of your consideration. Insomuch, as I must needs, not onely approve of your discretion, in tempering your love to Narcissus , and concealing your hate to Osirus , but do further counsel you; nay, must conjure you, that if the Prince do again importune you for your consent, which no doubt he will, that you seem to give your free approbation, for the future Marriage; neverthelesse, upon this condition, that it may be kept secret from any knowledge, until you have sent to your mother into Cyprus , to have her allowance; which promise cannot binde at all, not onely in respect of your former obligation to Narcissus , but also in regard you are a prisoner, and therefore not tied to any contract made in such a state; which, as I said before, will gain time, (the most precious thing we can desire, besides your absolute freedom) until either the winning of the Town, by the besiegers, probable enough, (since Sorastros is so employed in his Carthaginian Wars, that he cannot send any succours to relieve his son) or some other fortunate chance, give a period to your unfortunate intanglement; in the mean space, if my wits fail me not, I may project something for your advantage. And thus by fair words, with her discreet carriage, Cloria by little and little was perswaded to rest satisfied; the rather, for that Osirus employment in the Siege, gave her some weeks respit from his importunity. But Osirus one day, either over-hot with his affection, or conceiving he had permitted Cloria a sufficient time of consideration, came into the same Gallery, where she was again privately retired for her recreation; who, after she had entertained his short complements, with a pale countenance, and a trembling expression, the true witnesses of her troubled minde, he began to demand an account of her resolutions, since, as he said, he had given her both a noble and a gracious respite, and therefore wished her no longer to play the tyrant with his Love. Cloria , when she had a little recollected her distracted spirits, became something passionate of his peremptorty taxation, hoping thereby the better to obtain a longer protraction of her determinate answer for the Marriage, but he seeming to press it, with some violence, the Princess took the boldness to tell him, that although she intended not to dispute the question between his love and her tyranny, much less to examine the graciousness of his proceedings, yet since she was resolved to have more time, before she could fully consent to a business of so high a consequence, she desired him to have the patience which befitted a Suitor: This she delivered with a quick sharpness, contrary to her custome, that shewed, she was not mere displeased with his request, then confident of her power. Yet alas, the last opinion extreamly deceived her; for Osirus belike; disdaining in his proud nature to entertain any thing from his Captive, but humility, with a sowre brow, told her, that those sparkles which her beauty had kindled in his heart, were either to be kept alive by more violence, or to be utterly extinguished, by a just revenge; and these words put poor Cloria clean beside all her policy; so that she stood some time, like one that saw a Spirit, and had not courage enough to speak to it; which was an occasion that they both entertained one another for a pretty space, with their looks onely; until the compulsion of fear dictated to her thoughts, a necessity of redeeming again his good opinion, doubting her too much confidence had endangered, in some sort his displeasure; and therefore with an humble courtesie, although her countenance still put on shews of distrustful aversion, she thus spake unto him. My Lord, said she, by your aspect and words, I cannot but note your anger; which to my condition, is no less to be esteemed then absolute destruction, since I can neither fly from your wrath, nor resist your power: but how terrible that appears to my imagination, when you are treating in matters of love, that ought to be sweet and calm, I leave you to judge; when I am to be perpetually tyed to a subjection alwayes tyrannical, and never conversable, as I may believe by your present demeanour; since your jealousies and suspicions, at this time, far out-go your reason; and with that she wept: which gave Osirus occasion to take her in his arms, vowing by all the gods, that as his affection was no way diminished towards her, so he would resolve, when they were married, not onely to bury all jealousies, but to study a more pleasing conversation, that might render her happily contented; these expressions she acknowledged with a bow of her body, though she plaid in the mean space, onely the sad Hypocrite. After she had wiped her eyes, for now she was to act her part, according to her Governess direction, since she found her other project had failed her, she began again to speak to him in this manner; wherein she shewed, that her necessities had taught her a craft, that was not at all in her nature, for that she alwayes esteemed it dishonourable to dissemble. Sir, said she, if your professions be answerable to my expectation, and that your thoughts go along with your words, I shall be most happy in my Declaration, since as I am to be your Wife with honour and content, as you have promised, so I must desire you to permit those circumstances, without which they cannot be had; that is, that I may have liberty, before the publication of the Nuptials, to send into Cyprus to my Mother, not onely to let her know what is become of me, but withall, to purchase her free consent to so noble a choice; since, as you know it is the least duty of a childe, to give an account to their parents of that disposure, which absolutely banisheth them from their protection, and renders them Subjects of another Jurisdiction: wherein you will not onely afford sufficient proof of your being hereafter a kinde Husband, but of your being now a Noble Conquerour. Osirus , although he was beyond expression joy'd at her seeming consent, and tickled to hear, himself magnified by a tongue be most valued; yet he was scarce pleased at the request, both because it necessarily protracted the Marriage; as also, for that it raised some doubt, lest Hyacinthia should not be willing to the Match; which made him for some time wrestle with his determination, until at last, his over-weening fancy brought forth his judgement in the two points controverted by his suspicion; which was, that as in the first place he was bound in honour and love to give satisfaction to his now supposed Wife; so for the other, he could not fear the dislike of the Queen, but rather a hasty consent; not onely in regard it preserved, but dignified her Daughter: with this fancy, and a smiling countenance, (which until then he had never put on) he told Cloria , that her request was granted; however, with this proviso, that a messenger of his own, for the more state, as he pretended, should bear the Letter, wherein she might very well see a continuance of his jealousies, notwithstanding his glorious professions; though she could not much blame him for the humour, since she knew her own heart was not faithful to his purposes. But Cloria , however she was sorry for his caution, yet she was forced to give her consent, like one that was constrained to deal with his creditor after he was arrested; and so the present bargain was struck up between them, which she thought commodious, in respect it procured her a reprieve, hoping that ere long the consequence of the Siege might produce accidents to her advantage. Yet his telling her by chance, that his Father Sorastros , having compounded his Carthaginian differences, was resolved to march with his whole Army to relieve the Town, a little destroyed that hope; though he rather spoke it to satisfie his own vaunting humour, then out of any assurance he had of the design. In this posture Osirus , after he had endeavoured to shew his own amorous disposition by a few love complements, and with an ill grace, begg'd a kiss of her fair lips, he retired to entertain his own joy, and please himself with the fancies of his delightful Marriage, whilst in the mean time, with hasty steps, and a passionate minde, sweet Cloria went to seek out Roxana , to render her a perfect account of her proceedings; whom she found in her Chamber cloathing a little Dwarf, accompanied onely with her Maid-Servants: but Roxana quickly finding the distemper of her Mistriss, by her distracted looks, and confused demands, soon dismist the people, and after Cloria was seated upon her Bed, she importun'd her to know, what new accidents had again troubled her thoughts, since not long ago, she had left her in so good a humour; insomuch as at last, the Princess told her the whole story of Osirus carriage, and her own consent, wishing withal that she had rather hazzarded her life, by an absolute denial, then have given him so much satisfaction; whereupon Roxana began to smile: but Cloria apprehending a want of compassion in her Governess, told her, she was of the conspiracy with Osirus , to betray her love to Narcissus , since she could express mirth at this time in her countenance, when her self was tormented with a despairing misery. No, said Roxana , I laugh to see your wilful ignorance, that no instruction can inform; when put on what resolution soever you will, you return again to the same errour: For, I pray consider, if you have not that liberty of hazzarding your life, (as I have often told you) when you have tryed all wayes, by seeming to comply with Osirus desire, to gain time, as if you had exasperated his spleen by a peremptory denial at the first? and certainly that is the worst of your expectation; besides, you may remember, if you have not altogether forgot your own relation, how much he was distempered, when you did but mention, an incertainty in your resolution, of making him your Husband; insomuch as you were glad your self to cry peccavi , and suddenly by dissimulation to temper his passion. Yet, that you may see, I am not so great an enemy to your wishes, as your suspicion suggests to your imagination, I shall propound unto you probable remedies, if you have patience enough to put them in execution; if not, at leastwise sit still, and hear what I will act, without destroying my designs: These words made poor Cloria perk up her self with a new hope, since she could be never diffident in her Governess wisdome; and so by little and little drew near unto her, till at last she laid her head in the old womans bosome; whilst she had acquainted her with her project, in these words. The Boy, said she, which you saw us apparelling when you entred into the Chamber, (I hope sent by the Gods for our purpose) I bought, not long ago, of a Widow to an Ethiopian Merchant, because he could speak perfectly the Lydian Tongue, and is by Birth of Chios , brought up from his Infancy in the Art of Swimming, as all the rest of those Islanders are; insomuch as he is become admirable in that profession, and was made use of by his dead Master (who was a Jeweller by his Vocation) for his Commodity and Gain in his Traffick for Rich Stones, in respect the Rivers of these Countries yield abundance. However, not being very certain of his skill, before I had tried him in the Water, and curious to be assured that my new Servant wanted not that quality of Diving, according to the recommendation, (although I knew not what use I should have of that Science) I carried him down into the deep Cestern belonging to the Castle (which marks out yearly the rise and fall of Nilus to the people of the Countrey; whereby they may have a conjecture of the fertility of their harvest) as conceiving it the most convenient place to prove his cunning; not onely in regard it lay within the limits of our own lodgings, but also, for that the deepness of the Pool would make a better proof of his dexterity; where, not long he had plaid in the Water, (I, in the mean time casting in pieces of Money, which he alwayes fetcht up from the bottom) before he fell by chance upon the great Bolt, that fastens the Iron Gate, giving passage into the Castle, that cannot be perceived, by reason of the Stream, until the course be turned another way, by certain artificial Pipes, that delivers it into the River, which before I was aware he unbolted, to have the more liberty in Nilus ; but I soon called him into the Cestern again, not onely because I feared it might be discovered, but for that I began to think with my self, some benefit might be made of the knowledge: and to this purpose have considered, this boy may be sent into your Uncles Army, not onely to give him notice of your imprisonment, but to try, whether any brave spirits will attempt the surprize of the Castle through the same passage: he upon their approach opening the Water Gate to give them entrance, which is a project not hard to be put in execution in the night season, when the Guard shall be careless of their watch, by reason the place is not at all suspected. Besides, I have noted so much neglect of that part of the Fort, that either it appears Osirus wants Souldiers for the strong defence of the whole Town; or he conceives the Castle is inpregnable of that side of Nilus: Now all the fear is, left the Boy himself prove a Traytor to the Design; which however can but ruine my self, and leave you in no worse estate then you are; a Sacrifice I shall be alwayes content to offer, to render you the probability of so acceptable a service: but if there cannot be found those courages in the Camp, that will undergo the danger of the attempt, the Dwarf may have a further Commission to pass into Cyprus , to the Queen your Mother, to inform her of all the passages; by which information she may use some means to protract her consent to the Marriage; or at leastwise, prevent Osirus Messengers return, by causing him to be taken prisoner, before he can get to the Sea-side. No sooner had Roxana laid open this Stratagem, but Cloria , as if it had been already finished, profest her Governess the onely instrument of her happiness; (so far doth humane desire go beyond all judgement, governed by reason) though the politick old woman (notwithstanding she was willing to keep up her Mistrisses hopes at the highest pitch) saw there were many difficulties and hazzards to pass, before they could arrive at the period of their wishes; not onely by reason of divers accidents, that might happen to the childish Messenger, that was to be imployed in so dangerous a business; but for that Osirus , over-heated with his love, might not continue constant to his promises; and by that means easily destroy all that they had designed: however Roxana omitted no opportunity for some dayes, to instruct the Dwarf in the part he was to act; until her pains, after a weeks space, had in the dead of the night, delivered him free from the Castle Watch, and in the morning came to give Cloria an account of her proceeding. This enterprize so far pleased the Princess, in the already success, that whilst she was dressing her self, being in a manner free from all care and perturbation, by reason of the confidence she had of the project; that she desired her Governess, if she knew the story, to make her acquainted wich the first occasion of this War between her Uncle Orsames and Sorastros King of Egypt ; since, as she said, the spleen seemed to be irreconcilable. Truly Madam, answered Roxana , as the chief reason is ambition, the most powerful provoker of great Monarchs to enmity, notwithstanding the force of any alliance or Religion; yet the pretext, to satisfie the world, is related after this manner: There is, said she, a certain Dukedome, not far off the confines of Syria , whose defects of quantity is abundantly supplied by the fertility of the soil; which, besides the scituation of the Countrey, lying commodiously to both their Dominions, hath rendered it a subject of covetousness to each Prince: however, in my opinion, your Uncle had the better pretence for the quarrel; for the Duke of the Territory dying without Heirs Males of his Body, the King of Armenia, by the provocation of Sorastros , claimed the forfeiture of the Countrey, as an Escheat belonging to his Kingdome; and of the other side, Orsames stood for the title of one of his own Subjects, who certainly had the just right in the principality, though not condescend unto by the other party; which at last, procured the raising of powerful armies of both sides; but before they could come conveniently to encounter one with another, it was necessary they should pass Arabia , a Countrey not onely mountainous, but belonging to a Prince, that as he was near of kin to Sorastros , by former alliance, so was he for the present Married to a Sister of Orsames , which made him have a hard part to play; desiring to keep an equal ballance between both these contentions, until the Gods at one time took away both his care and life: but his Widow, quickly put his Children under the protection of Orsames her Brother, by which means his pretensions became much more fortified, insomuch as Sorastros had no other way to countervail that interest, but to cause the two Uncles of the young Prince, to lay claim to the Dominion, as pretending the Childe not to be legitimate: this imagined Title, quickly made a division of all the Nobility of the Countrey, some taking part with the Brothers, others with the young Duke; whilst in the mean time both Orsames and Sorastros put in for their own interest; the one pretending a jurisdiction in the Countrey, in the Childrens Right, as the other sought to strengthen the Uncles Titles; which contention made the poor Subjects become miserable, since they were forced to sustain the charge of the ambitious Armies; and Arabia being made the Theater of the War, the walled Towns were the onely receptacles of provisions, and protection for the inhabitants, which appeared to be more lasting, for that the Victories seemed to go by turns a long time; till at last the Egyptian Forces prevailing, the Princess, with the young Duke, was constrained, for want of timely assistance from her Brother, being busied in other affairs, to seek refuge in one of the strongest and best fortified Cities of the Countrey; where being not onely besieged, but violently assaulted by the adverse party, she had a task hard enough, to escape by an obscure flight in the night, whilst in the interim, the Town, was yielded into hands of her Brothers-in-law, though the Castle still kept possession for the lawful Prince: the Enemy, by his success, appeared in a manner quite possessors of the whole Countrey; until Orsames General, lying with his Army upon the Confines of Syria , necessarily to repair the decay of his Forces, hearing of the prevailing progress of the Nobility, conceived it more then time to stop this overflowing current, unless he would suffer not onely the Duke to be dis-inherited by the practises of his Uncles, but his Master to be dishonoured by the power of the Egyptians: wherefore, as desperate diseases are to be cured by extraordinary Physick, not so much as staying for the necessary recruit of his Army, marched with a haste answerable to the greatness of the Design, which was, again to recover the loft Town, that seemed principally to command the whole Countrey, or bury himself, and all his Souldiers before those Walls, he should not be able to enter. At his arrival, he not onely set upon those Troops that were placed to stop his passage, but gave them an intire Defeat, though their numbers far exceeded those he conducted, that also were accompanied with the disadvantage of being wearied in their Journey, having nothing but their own invincible courages to supply the defect. But however, this admirable esteemed Victory, both possessed the brave General of the Town, and reduced many of the revolted Nobility, to their lawful obedience; yet the sparkles of so great a disunion, were impossible to be buried in the Cinders of a quiet Peace; especially, since the Egyptian neighbouring Countries were alwayes capable to kindle new flames, without some agreement by consent; so that it was designed to use all means could be devised, to render the Uncles, contented; whereby the Prince might the better be secured, and established in his rightful inheritance, and the Countrey freed from the fear of any more Civil War; in prosecution of which, the one was bought with rich gifts, to become Orsames General in those Wars he intended against Sorastros , by reason of these occasions; and the other was Married to the Dukes Sister, his own Neece; the likelier to continue his friendship between him and his Sister-in-law, and make the party stronger for Orsames intentions, which was to revenge the injuries that he conceived the Æ gyptians intended against his Sisters honour, and his Nephews right. This Madam, said Roxana , hath been the beginning of the Quarrels between these two mighty Monarchs, that both have, and is likely still to disturb the tranquility of the most part of Asia , of which now the Countrey of Lydia , your Fathers Kingdom, begins also to bear a large share; since it is not to be doubted, but Philostros sets afoot the troubles there, because the King would not joyn in an absolute League with Syria: but scarce had she come to this point, when she was informed that Osirus was near at hand, to visit the Princess; which gave them no more time; then was necessary to prepare for his unwelcome company; and so consequently broke off for the present their discourse. Osirus , that began to esteem himself in a manner Lord of his desires; having his Mistris affections, as he believed, under his command, as he had her person in his custody; nothing being now between the fruition and his hopes, but a few ceremonious approbations of her Parents; entred the room, not like a fearful Lover, or a modest Suiter, but already a married Husband, taking presently Cloria in his arms; whilest he prophaned, as she imagined, the chaste temple of her Lips, with three or four impure kisses, that left them after a while, to blush for the attempt; however he presently turned to Roxana , and told her, that when the Nuptials were past, he would study some convenient preferment for her age; either by a rich Husband to keep her sides warm, or an honourable jurisdiction, to exercise her experience; not knowing how little faithful she had been, and intended to be, to his purposes; notwithstanding she humbly thanked him for his gracious favour. After this he began to fall into a large commendation of all his vertues; but especially of his admirable valour, that never refused any danger, how great and common soever, in the Wars, or otherwise; though the dignity of his person was a sufficient priviledge, as he said against such attempts. But during the time that he was using these brags, which gave poor Cloria a sufficient surfeit, he was informed, that a Herald attended in the Gallery, with a Letter from the Camp. Osirus believing that it was some offered Treaty of Composition from Orsames , hearing of the determination of his Father, to raise the Siege, instantly commanded the Messenger to be brought into his Presence, that his Mistriss might be witness of his Glory: after he had received and opened the Letter, he read it aloud, that the whole company might be satisfied in the Contents, scorning to conceal what resolution soever of the Enemy; however contrary to his expectation, the Writing spake this Language.  Osirus , I am to let you know, that your Messenger, whom you intended to send into Cyprus , is surprized by our Army; whereby the Love you offer to the fair Princess Cloria , is discovered, with your Design, to demand her in Marriage, of her Mother, the Queen Hyacinthia ; which is a request, neither in her power to grant, nor for your Honour to desire; since I pretend a former promise of her Affection, not to be released by any Power, unless she her self do unworthily flye from the Contract; an act, I can never believe, until I see it under-written by that white Hand, that I suppose will not be consenting to so black a Deed: in the mean time I must think it, either a project of your own foolish Presumption, or a Constraint, proceeding from the wicked Tyranny of her Imprisonment, that gives you boldness to make so unjust a demand. Wherefore, if you have any remnants left, of that Noble Blood, which belongs to your House, a Prerogative you so much boast of; shew it, either in leaving off so preposterous a Suit, and set the Lady free from her Captivity, whereby she may become absolute Mistriss of her Choice; or else prepare your self with courage, to give me the meeting in a single Combate, to dispute the Title: Else I must let you know, that as I am the white Knight, which disarmed you in the Head of your Troops; so must I from hence forward, proclaim you to be a cowardly Traytor to Love, Valour, and Vertue; and so consequently, not onely unworthy of your Pretensions, to be Husband to such a Wife, but of any other match, how low soever can be propounded, although you bear the name of a Prince; unto which I subscribe my name, Narcissus.  After that Osirus had read the Letter, and for some time considered the Contents thereof, with a disdainful smile he told the Messenger, that as he pardoned his rashness, for bringing such peremptory Lines, to be presented to a Majesty, not to be discerned by so poor a sight as his own; so he commanded him to let the Boy know, not onely his own contempt of his person, but that the Princess Cloria , (who was a Wife rather fit for the Gods, then for a Childe of so mean condition) disdained the very mentioning of his Love; wherein, he thought he much obliged her with a complement. And for the Combat, if the greatest Monarch of the world had sent him a Challenge (as he said) he must therein have followed the direction of his Councel; much less endeavour to give satisfaction to such preposterous Lines. After the Messenger was discharged, Osirus went out of the Room, as if his choler had got the absolute prerogative over his brags; whilst in the mean time, Cloria and her Governess, had sport enough to laugh at his folly, as well as to be joyful at the neighbourhood of Narcissus ; which gave them sufficient imployment and delight all the day following. However, the next morning, to their no small amazement, they were called up to the Leads of the Castle, to behold a great distraction in Orsames Army, before the Town, wherein appeared an extraordinary slaughter; upon what ground they could not possibly imagine, unless it were some accidental, and unfortunate mutiny amongst themselves; which notwithstanding, so much troubled them both, that they soon retired, with the undelightfulness of the prospect, into their own Lodgings, to attend the issue of the supposed difference; where they had not rested two hours, tormented with variable fears, and greedy expectations, before they were informed, that some Troops sent by Sorastros to relieve his Son, because he could not yet spare more Forces from his new enagements, had with invincible courage made their passage through the Enemies Camp, and with safety got entrance into the Town, to the absolute furnishing of the Garrison; which (as 'twas delivered) created new courage in the hearts of the people; insomuch that now (as they said) they did not care for the continuance of the Siege, since they were sufficiently provided against all Orsames power. Cloria and Roxana , notwithstanding this news, were extream glad it was no worse; although of the other side, they were troubled to think upon the protraction of their delivery, if their project should any way miscarry, the accident giving conveniency to double the Guards in every place, one of the greatest obstacles to the Design; however their hopes so much outwent their fears, that their imaginations were contented in some sort to rest satisfied. But Osirus , being puft up with the joy of these new succours, not onely, for that they so much strengthened his Forces in the Town, but had, as he believed, most courageously beaten Orsames , since they made their way through his whole Army, resolved the next day himself in person to make a general sally upon the Enemy; and by that means, as he hoped, absolutely to finish the Siege: neither could he abstain from sending a Messenger to the Princess, as well to inform her of his success, as to promise her the chastisement of the proud Boy Narcissus , as he termed him; which belike he imagined would be most welcome news to her ears. Cloria , although she scarce liked his determination, yet she was confident enough of his want of power to execute his resolution; knowing that Orsames , her Uncle, neither wanted Souldiers in his Camp, to resist his attempt, nor conduct in his Officers, to be sufficiently watchful against any surprize; especially being taught provident experience by the last dayes Conflict; and for Narcissus , who went nearest her heart, although she was possessed with some gentle fears continually of his safety, yet she was abundantly confident of his Valour; not onely in the consideration of the bold Challenge he had lately sent Osirus , but in the common report she had heard of his Fame, during these Wars, under the Title of the White Knight; however she was content, by the perswasion of her Governess, to return a dissembling thanks for the Princes favour, that he would vouchsafe to make her acquainted with his great and secret Designs. After the Messenger was departed, as Cloria and Roxana spent most of the day, and the night following, in discourses concerning their Affairs, (in which interim, now and then the sweet Princess let fall some tears, with many silent Prayers to the Gods, both for the prosperity of her Condition, and the safety of Narcissus ;) so of the other side, Osirus was more then busied in the preparation, and encouragement of his Souldiers, sometime taking counsel, whether it were better to set upon the Enemy in the day, or the night; and how to mannage the Sally they intended to make, to the best advantage: other while he caused false Alarums to be given to the Camp, with beat of Drum, and sound of Trumpet, whereby the better not onely to deceive Orsames expectation, that he might be less prepared, when he should set upon him, but also to weary his Souldiers, remaining in their Arms; all which imployment took up the time, until Osirus (after two dayes, in the dead of the night, so determined by a Councel of War) issued forth out of the Town, with most of his Forces, onely leaving the Burgers to man the Walls; and marched in that manner silently, without any noise at all, the better to surprize the Enemy. But contrary to his expectation, or rather to his extraordinary amazement, he found the Camp raised, and Orsames gone; onely some few left (as they confessed, being taken by the Souldiers) to set fire to the Camp the next morning. This news, as it gave sufficient cause of wonder to Osirus Army, so it was quickly carried with joy into the Town; wherefore, the Troops returning again, after some slight Sacrifices were performed to the Gods, every one betook themselves to those appetites that best pleased their sensualities; the Citizens onely taking care, as in time of Peace, for the safety of the City: but by this strange, or rather ominous accidents, Cloria's hopes seemed now to be absolutely ravished, and her miserable captivity to be eternally prolonged; nor had Roxana scarce courage left her to comfort her sorrowful Mistriss in any kinde, that could produce the least flattering confidence; yet after they had spent the tedious day in diversity of passions, which appeared to be the more tyrannical, for that they were forced in part, to smother their griefs in their secret bosoms, that they might not come to the knowledge of those spies, which were commanded to attend their persons, if not secure their imprisonment; at night they both cast themselves down upon their Beds, without taking the pains to pull off their Cloathes, not believing that rest they were probably to take, could merit the labour. However they had not reposed in that posture much above two hours, in frightful Slumbers, and disquiet Dreams, engendred in their thoughts by despairing apprehensions, when of the sudden they were called up by a Maid Servant, to behold a bloody Conflict in the Castle Hall, whereof they had the more commodity to be spectators, in regard the Window of the Wardrobe that belonged to their Lodgings, had a full prospect into the place: the fight seemed more horrid, in regard onely of a faint light proceeding from a dark Lamp, that was hung in the middle of the Room, which rather appeared like the Taper of Death, since it was the means to shew the way to a greater slaughter, then was commodious, or at all delightful to the view: but after a while that the confused combatants either wearied by overmuch destruction, or the prevailing party having gained too apparent advantage over those of the Castle, (in part to be discerned by their Livery) began to breathe, whilst the others fled, either to seek more help, or to save their lives; yet long they had not enjoyed that repose, (and I may say in some sort necessary) but they might hear a Knight among the rest, that seemed to be the chief Captain of the Company in Command, to blame them for their slothfulness in prosecution, considering (as he said) the work was not half done, until they were full possessors of the Fort; with these words flourishing a little his Sword about his head, he endeavoured to make a new passage into the innermost Rooms; but long it was not before he was strongly opposed by a Guard at the Door, that courageously denyed him entrance, until many of their lives had paid for the bold attempt. This brought Osirus ready armed to warrant his Guards Commission; so that the Knight was forced to retire back into the Hall, not so much to give way to the fury of his stroak, as perceiving him to be the Prince by his own Language, to have the more space conveniently to fight, since he found himself shut up in a strait entry: never till then began a combat worth the beholding; for, as Osirus seemed to contend, for the defence of his Castle, knowing them by their own confession to be Orsames Souldiers, so the Captain, as it were by the provocation of honour, strived by force of Armes to make him his prisoner, being the chief Prince of the Countrey; since the glory of the victory appeared, onely to consist in such a conquest as himself believed; whilst in the mean time his other followers pursued the rest of the guard round about the Fort, until they had absolutely rendred them subjects of their wrath, or objects of their mercy; and thus continued these confused slaughters, and fearful cryes of dying and yielding persons, to the astonishment of poor Cloria , whose eyes had not been often acquainted with such spectacles, till the Dwarf Roxana had sent to inform Orsames of their Captivity, appeared suddenly at their backs, and almost as soon informed them, not onely of the success of his enterprize in the Army, but withal told them, that it was Narcissus that for the present combated with Osirus . Then the Princess began again to be possessed with some new fears, as doubting the issue of the fight, since she beheld both their armours alike besprinkled with blood, which caused her a little to withdraw her sight; by the interposition of a certain curtain that covered the windows; however not being able long to withhold her curious though distracted looks, from that fearful object as she conceived, after some more time looking again into the Hall, she might behold Osirus fall down, before the conquering Sword of brave Narcissus ; who presently notwithstanding made haste to him with seeming wings of charity and compassion, and soon unlaced his Head-piece, with intention to give him some refreshing ayre, as the most necessary means to call him again out of his sounding, that appeared to his apprehension the next neighbour unto death: Osirus after he had recovered a new life by this courtesie, fixed his eyes stedfastly upon him, as if however in a manner, he disdained all assistance in that nature; until at last in an appearing passion, he uttered these words: Is it possible the Gods can thus envy my fate, as not onely to make me a base Captive in my own Castle, but to necessitate my fortunes to such a condition, as to render me needful of an enemies favour? nay, rather said he, let me dye a thousand times in the heighth of your cruelties, and my own misfortune: then presently shut his eyes again, as if he hated the dayes light, though as it might be thought, more for his conceived disgrace to be so overcome, then for the loss of his liberty and prosperity; however Narcissus commanded his Officers, instantly to bear the wounded Prince to his Chamber, without any other reply, then that his condition required patience and not passion; which absolutely made up the full period of his fortunate glory, to the amazed content of his most beautiful love: but Cloria being perswaded by Roxana , to give Narcissus a visit in the Hall, since that was the honourable Theater, where he had acted so valiant a part for her delivery, she hasted in her resolutions to that wished entertainment, which diverted other considerations; however Narcissus not so cold in his love to his fair Mistriss, after he had disposed of Osirus to safe custody, with a strict command for his noble usage, and a diligent care to be had of his wounds, made what haste he could up into the Princess Chamber, as to the Temple where he intended to offer his first Sacrifice after his Victories, which was the occasion they both met upon the stairs. Narcissus when he beheld the onely Goddess of his heart, had much ado to abstain from open Idolatry; however, his tongue could not forbear these expressions, when he had sealed his own welcome, with his longing lips upon her white hand: Most excellent Princess, said he, the onely hope of my life, and the very life of all my hopes, whose goodness and beauty are such parallels of perfection, that heaven and earth seem to have conspired in your Birth; since by the one you conquer the world, as by the other you do more then prevail with the Divine Powers. And yet, said Cloria , you seemed to challenge a great prerogative in my love, when you durst express in your Letter to Osirus , your interest to my person and affection, in so bold a stile and language, without my privacy and allowance, which might have cost me dear, if your fortune had not been better then your temper. At which reproof Narcissus (fearing he had exasperated the Princess anger by that Declaration) began with trembling and distracted words, to make an apology for that presumption: But merciful Cloria , when she had conducted him into her own Chamber, and there for some time entertained him with pretty smiles; onely enjoyned him for his pennance, the relation of his adventures, since she left him at her Mothers Court, in the habit of Aminta : yet considering what a discovery, unawares she had made to Roxana's knowledge, she could not chuse but grow red, whilst her Governess lookt her in the face with some wonder, to hear of the name of Aminta her own servant, and Narcissus her Mistriss Lover to be the same person: This made the Princess blush with the more violence, till at last the riddle was unfolded by her self, since it could not be any longer kept secret; however with a conjuration to her Governess, never to divulge it to any person living. But having appeased all these differences, at last Narcissus whom she onely blamed for the act, began his story in this manner. After, said he, the news of your strange loss was spread through your Mothers Court, and so consequently over all the Island of Cyprus , which left no corner without grief and sorrow, I resolved presently to change my disguise, and search you in every place, that could afford any probability of your abode; and first it came into my imagination, that you might be voluntarily retired into Lydia , to accompany your Father in his necessities; however that was but a fancy to all knowing judgements, since you would before the determination, have made the Queen acquainted with your resolution, who rather believed that some love conspiracy between us two, had made you privately quit the Countrey: but as both I and others supposed we knew not what, so I went I knew not where, till at last by a rough Journey at Sea, I arrived upon the Coast of Caria , with an intention to enquire whether or no, you made your abode in your Fathers Court, however I was before-hand convinced in the improbability of the demand; where nevertheless by chance, I met with a Ship of those Pyrates, that had fled from the rest that took you Prisoner, not being consenting to your transportation into Egypt , which was put into that harbour, with a resolution, if they could not be admitted speedily into the service of Euarchus against his own Subjects, who had already as 'twas reported imployed most of his Royal Navy against his Command, they would direct their course to Tyre , to make the same offer to Orsames your Uncle; by which means I became absolutely informed of them, of all those passages that concerned your person, amongst the Pyrates before your coming to Memphis: but they receiving a refusal, by reason the King your Father esteemed not himself, yet ready for their assistance, I determined to take the commodity of that Ship for my transportation into Syria: however, because the Vessel needed some reparation before it could go out of the Haven of Caria , I had sufficient leasure given me in a disguise, to inform my self of the affairs of your Father, as a duty belonging to you, whom as I was told had lately quitted the City of Sardis , and was retired for his greater security (though with a very few company) to Theatira , a place as it was conceived much more addicted to his service: upon my arrival I found him in a condition in that City beyond my expectation, not onely attended by most of the Gentry and Nobility of the Kingdome of Lydia , but going to a great assembly of people gathered together by his command; unto whom he made an oration to this purpose. My Lords, said he, and you the rest of my Subjects, as I am not more glad to see this joyful Declaration of your Duties to my Service, then willing to imploy my best endeavours for your protection, so I hope the Gods will give me the power still to be your King, notwithstanding the cunning and malicious practises of many, who have sought to bereave me of that honour, alledging I have a will rather to become a Tyrant, then continue a Governour: but for that this meeting is principally designed, that you may the better know me, and I be more assured of you, I shall strive to let you see my acts and thoughts: in the first place, no sooner was I throughly possest of the grievances of my Kingdomes, but I assembled the great Councel to give them redress; wherein I not onely condescended to pass such decrees as were thought necessary for that purpose, but assured the continuance thereof, absolutely to bury all fears and jealousies, that might arise, by reason of any doubt of my inconstancy; however this is now so far turned to my disadvantage, that I am not onely denyed any more mannaging the Affairs of the Commonweale, contrary to the known Laws of Lydia , but have been in a manner, forcibly driven from Sardis , my regal City, with disorderly tumults; neither can probably be again established in my ancient Right, without your assistance. In the second place, I can give you no stronger assurance, then my deep vows to the Gods, that I will never change the Laws, Customs, and Religion of the Kingdome, which are testimonies sufficient for your belief, against calumniations, and false aspersions, cast about in your ears to my prejudice; since in your loves I mean rather to rule, then by my own Sword. And now I shall proceed to let you see the danger to your selves by this intended change of Laws; though, before you can be entirely instructed therein, you must be throughly informed of the constitutions of your own present Government, the best composed certainty of all other, since it is a Monarch of that restriction, that it neither takes from the King that power that is necessary for his obedience, nor yet leaves the Subject in a slavish subjection; so that if he would, he cannot be a Tyrant; and if he will, he may be a Prince: in the one, the people are invited to obey with love; and in the other, the Sovereign is compelled to govern with humanity, since he hath not power to be over-insolent, as the Subject liberty to be licentious; insomuch as there will now rest nothing, but to mark out to your understandings my Priviledges and your Rights, whereby you may the more clearly distinguish, of the unhappy differences between me and my Senate; which as I take it, is the plainest way of demonstration, since the matter is brought into fact, and not left to opinion. To this purpose, I challenge, by the Laws, Customs, and Fundamental Constitutions of this Kingdome, never yet contradicted, or disputed by any time, the creating of Nobility, ordaining Officers, pardoning Offenders, confiscations of Offenders, raising of Forces, making War or Peace, convocating or dismissing Senates, and a Negative voice in the Proceedings, as undoubted Prerogatives belonging to the Crown of Lydia , not to be invaded by the endeavour of any Subject, without incuring those penalties, that belong to the crime of Treason against the Kings Person; of the other side, the people may justly pretend to this liberty, the absolute freedom of their lives, which they cannot forfeit, without a legal Trial by men of their own Rank and Countrey: a power to enjoy and dispose of their Goods, without the leave of any person whatsoever; and a successive Inheritance in their Lands, that cannot be interposed by any of another Blood or Kindred: the first gives the Prince such a jurisdiction as is necessary for his Government, the other maintains the people in a pleasing freedome, to themselves; without the one there must needs follow, that which can produce nothing but confusion; and lacking the other, men are so enthralled, that they must needs want courages to defend, or good their Countrey; wherefore, if I lack that fitting Right that belongs unto a King, you must miss of that protection needful for Subjects, since the disputation of command onely, will distract the resolutions of such as are commanded in their obedience; whereby profitable resolutions cannot be put in execution. Besides, if I should poorly suffer my ancient Right to be invaded, can it be thought my lasting posterity, will be content in after ages, with such a loss? since they will have many Princes, stung with the example, to assist them in the justness of the quarrel; which will at last, either endanger the Subjects of the Kingdome, to be made Captives to Forreign Power, or at the least, fill the whole Realm with Blood and Slaughters, to its absolute destruction? So that, I say, as these were most laudible constitutions, conveyed unto you by the wisdome of your Ancestors, so do not you by your own stupid wilfulness, (for no better can I call it) endeavour to abolish that excellent Government, that hath continued you happy for so many ages; resembling the Giants, that made a preposterous War with Heaven, until they and their proud endeavours were all buried in a confused destruction. I speak not this, that I so much doubt you in your affections, as I fear others in their subtilties; for as no hypocrisie is so dangerous, as that which brings with it the name of Religion; so no bait is so catching, as that which is sweetned with the promise of liberty. Remember but your past delight, and compare it with the present distraction, and I am assured you will finde a difference; wherefore if these be but the beginnings of evils, consider what the end will be: Alterations of Government are like desperate purges, that at the best exceedingly distemper, and at the worst are deadly. If you should have more freedom then you have, you would but break your windes before you get to the end of your course; and if you have less then you enjoy, may the Gods punish me for my tyranny; let your old Law-marks guide you in your subjection and obedience, and suffer no new ones to be set up, that will not teach you to void Rocks, since you are not acquainted with their stations. That Subject must needs be in great slavery, that neither knows a certain rule whereby to do well, or can comprehend the power of the Lord he is to obey: let the things you know be your punishment or reward, by which you may easily square your endeavours, and not bring a judgement upon your selves, for that you cannot possibly learn; since it will not be your crime that condemns you, but other opinions that judges you. But perchance it may be alledged, that this unlimited jurisdiction is to last but during the necessity of the time; unto which it may as probably be answered, that as any new authority obtained, is seldom or never given over, but by force; so of the other side, it is more then suspicious there is no such intention, when the old way is sufficient to govern moderately by, without seeking a new, by injurious difficulties; no, no, be not deceived, for scarce yet a change hath been made in any State (under what pretensions soever) that ever it came to the same form again, notwithstanding something plausible at the first, was offered to the people, to procure it the fairer passage. In a word, I must confess your liberty is as convenient as my prerogative, and without which, neither of both can be happy: Wherefore let us resolve, that neither the one nor the other, shall be destroyed by violence or craft; and as I will never stretch my jurisdiction to prejudice you, so do not you abuse your own liberty to destroy your selves. But however the Kings speech was variously interpreted by the multitude, who were bewitched with the desires of equality; yet the Gentry and Nobility put on such strong resolutions to defend your Fathers Rights, since upon that depended the honour of their own Dignities, that in a short time, as I have been since informed, he became Master of a brave Army, commanded by his own Nephew, called Thyasmus , younger Brother to Prince Cassianus , who had been taken prisoner by the King of Armenia , in seeking to revenge, or rather maintain his dead Fathers quarrel; from whence after some time of noble imprisonment, he was released without any other ransom, then that he should never, during his life, bear Armes against Artaxis ; which was the occasion, he being of a restless spirit, that he sought imployment in his Uncles Service, and by reason of these new troubles hath obtained it. And this dear Princess, is all the account I can give you of your Fathers affairs, since I was forced to make haste to the Ship I had hired of the Pyrates for my transportation to Tyre ; where being arrived, afterward I took my Journey to Damascus , to Orsames Court, whom I found ready prepared with his Army to march to the Siege of Memphis ; in whose Troops I quickly made my self a Souldier, and so continued until the Messenger that Osirus had sent into Cyprus , to demand you in Marriage of the Queen your Mother, was taken by the Sentinels, and brought into the Camp. This discovery inflamed my soul with so much jealousie, that I begg'd leave of Orsames to send the foolish challenge that seemed to claim an interest in your affections; for which I hope I have already received my full correction. I, said the Princess, when you have absolutely made an end of your pennance, by finishing your story, not yet performed, since the chief part is behinde, the manner of my deliverance; which continued still Narcissus in his relation. After that the Herald , said he, was returned without any satisfactiaon to my thoughts, in a melancholly jealousie, I retired from the Army, (it being the reason I was not in the last conflict, when the Forces sent from Sorastros entred the Town) for that most desperately I blamed your inconstancy, since I believed you had consented to Osirus desires. In this distracted posture I continued, until I was sent for by Orsames , to be made acquainted with your Dwarfs arrival, who propounded to me the design that was to be executed. But the Gods know, my heart being freed from that deadly suspition, of your being won by the greatness of Osirus person, I was ready in my own conceit, to have reached a star from heaven, to have made you a present, in requital of the injury my thoughts had done your vertue; so that I staid not long to consider of my resolution; by which example many of the youthful Nobility, out of emulation, determined to take my part; however, the design was not onely with a great deal of care kept secret from the knowledge of the common Souldiers, but it was ordained by the Councel of War, that the Army it self should seem to retire from the siege, to give a greater cause of security to the Castle, whereby to be less prepared; so consequently the more easily surprized upon the execution of the enterprize: with these resolutions, (being fortified with courageous hopes, since they carried with them the delivery of your excellent self, from a tyrannical imprisonment, against all the Laws of Love and Justice) we sailed in small Barks up the River of Nilus ; and yesterday by the conduction of your Dwarfe, we entred undiscovered the Iron Gate of the Cestern; where, after a little slaughter of the negligent watch, we became masters of all the Courts of Guard of the Castle; and so with ease enough past into the Hall, until at last being discovered by some that fled from destruction, we were encountred by Osirus , and the souldiers that attended upon his person; which gave us again new employment, since in truth both he and his followers defended themselves with a courage to be commended; but in the end, our numbers (I cannot say altogether our valours) made them all either our Captives, or our Sacrifices. And so, sweet Princess, according to your command, you have the story of your own power, that is able to inspire the weakest captives, with sufficient force to become Conquerours of the greatest Monarchs. But he was scarce come to this point, when he felt the smart of a concealed wound he had received in his thigh, which he perceived not whilest he was hot with the fight; so that presently he desired leave to retire into his Chamber, to have the assistance of the Chyrurgeons; which was granted him by Cloria , with a pretty fear however of some danger, discovered by the often changing of colour in her face; yet when he was there and disarmed, the Physicians quickly found that it was but a flesh wound, and therefore subject to no hazard, though some inconvenience: before he took his rest, because it began to be day, he commanded a Flag to be set upon the top of the Castle, to give warning to Orsames of the prosperous success of his enterprize; which gave occasion to the King presently, to march with his whole Army before the walls of the Town, which struck the mindes of the people with such a sudden amazement, that upon a message that was sent them to yield, they presently called a Councel, to resolve what answer to return to so peremptory a demand; having also notice that Osirus was made a prisoner in his own Castle. This procured a great mutiny amongst the Inhabitants; for the Townsmen having got the possession of the walls, by reason of the Souldiers late Sally, being willing to save their goods by any composition, resolved to deliver Memphis to the enemies forces; whilest the others, by way of honour, contended against the determination, not without some slaughter on both sides; however, Orsames in the confusion assaulting the City, with the assistance of those souldiers in the Castle, who set upon their backs, quickly reduced them to so much reason, that the Town was willing to render upon composition, that Osirus promising to pay such a ransome agreed upon, should have the freedom of his person; but Orsames would not yield, to have the glory of his Conquest spotted with any other condition, then what his own mercy was willing to grant: And with these thoughts prepared his Army again, to enter by force, vowing the destruction of all the Inhabitants. The Princess Cloria being informed of her Uncles resolution, sent a messenger to desire him, that since she had been a Captive, so long a time to Osirus power, that he would be pleased now, to make him personally a prisoner to her will, by which means she should in some sort, revenge the indignity that was done to her birth and condition. This being granted, she presently sent a discharge to Osirus , to dispose of himself and souldiers, in what way he should like for his most honour. The Prince, although he accepted of Cloria's noble courtesie, with all the expressions of thankful acknowledgement could be devised, wherein he profest she had more overcome his thoughts, with her admirable humanity, then Orsames fortunes had his person with his prevailing power; yet he assured her, he would pay that ransome that was offered for his liberty; and withal sent her a rich chain of pearle, of an inestimable value, which he besought her, she would wear on the day of her marriage for his sake, as a remembrance of his desire, to crown her Queen not onely of his Kingdoms, but of his heart. When the agreement was sealed by Commissioners of both sides, Orsames prepared to make his triumphant entry into the City, wherein Osirus was entreated to be a party; but he not being able, to brook the sight of a new Prince, to be installed in his right, not onely excused the acceptance of such a courtesie; but after he had given a ceremonious visit to the Princess Cloria , though carried in a chair, because his wounds would afford him no other commodity, he commanded himself to be placed in his Litter, and so carried to the next Garrison Town under his jurisdiction, whilest Orsames as a most glorious Conquerour took possession of Memphis in this manner. First, the Foot marched with Olive branches in their hands, that foretold peace and prosperity to the inhabitants, having all their arms adorned with Flower de Luces gilded, besides the brightness of their weapons, that by the reflection of the sun gave a terrifying though pleasing beauty to the Spectators. After these came the guard of Orsames person, being ten thousand in number, who were so expert by reason of their continual practice, that it was a question, whether they more honoured their master in time of peace, or defended him in occasions of War. When these were past, which shut up the first dayes Triumph, the next morning the Nobility richly apparalled both in their own persons, and their horses trappings, were ranked according to their degrees, who by the brave mannaging of their couragious beasts, gave admirable delight to the beholders, since the Sun and the Winde seemed both to conspire in the shew; for as the one gave a glittering grace to the splendor of their habits, so the other gently playing with their feathers, rendred them more becomming. Then the great Officers of Syria proceeded in Chariots, by reason of their ages and dignities, with all their Ensigns of honour born before them, to mark out to the people the several qualities of their places, attended by multitudes of Pages and Footmen, distinguished by their several Liveries. After all these appeared Philostros himself, the very soul of the Court, carried in an open Litter, since he was not to be eclipsed from the eyes of the multitude, whose wisdom and power was to give them Laws: however he was surrounded by a particular guard of his own, to prevent all dangers to his person, and although his clothing was simply red satten, yet his attendants sufficiently shewed forth his glory. But Orsames was seated in a Throne drawn with four Elephants, wherein Jupiter might have triumphed, after his Victory against the rebellious Giants; the Statue of Mars , the God of War, was placed at his back, crowning him with a Victorious Laurel, whilest many Cupids seemed to support the Curtains of his Chariot, where his Guard hemm'd him in from the crowd of the vulgar, though not from the sight of the people, since he was so high mounted in his seat. After followed the master of his Horse, leading a spare one of the Arabian breed, covered with a Caparison of watchet Velvet, embroidered with Flower de Luces of Gold, bearing in his top a Phenix plume; which shew being past, the Cavalry of Syria brought up the Rear, who exceedeth no more for beauty and number, then for skill and valour: And in this order followed their great master, to the chief gate of Memphis ; where entring, he was for some time entertained, with these Verses written in Capital Letters of Gold.  Great Monarch of the earth, now as the Sun, You do appear in Egypt's Horizon; By which reflection let Memphis Towers, Shine ever with propitious Bowers, Vntil an influence fall from those Beams, To enrich the vertue of old Nylus streams, That strange productions in his pregnant slyme, May multiply as by a heat divine: So shall the fertile fields in every thing, Paint forth the wonders of your conquering; Whilst we worship your rise with much more zeal, Then doth the Abassine cloath'd in his vail; When at the Altar burning sacrifice, He doth invoke a God unknown for Spice; And superstitiously will not believe, Natures increase but as such actions give: But we in Hieroglyphicks are bid to fear No force but yours that turns our Hemiphear; For if there come gentle looks from your eye, All here is blest, our fruits can never dye, Longer we shall not adoration sing. Vnto Osirus , but Orsames King. Which finished, he went to the great Temple, to offer Sacrifice to the Gods for his prosperous Victories, and afterward to the Castle, where Cloria stood ready at the Gate to receive her Uncle, accompanied by the chief Ladies of the City. But however every one seemed amazed at that admirable beauty, drest with so sweet a modesty, seeing her with bashful blushes present her first salutations to Orsames , yet Philos whose youth and greatness might, as he thought, pretend to any love, without the contradiction of what interest soever, began to be kindled with violent flames at the brightness of the object, though for the present, he tempered his passion from being perceived. This continued the longer hid, as well for want of opportunity to operate, as because the brave Prince of Arabia , who owed the protection of his Person and Countrey to Orsames , could not chuse as he believed, but honour his triumphs with some endeavours of his own: to that purpose he proclaimed in his Camp, a Turnament against all commers, in the behalf of the beauty of his fair Mistriss Augusta ; which took up the imployment, not onely of all the youthful Nobility, but also invited many forreign Princes against the day appointed, to try their fortunes in that generous exercise: The place designed by Orsames command, was in a large green without the Walls of Memphis : when the time came, the Prince of Arabia appeared in a white Armour, painted with craggy Rocks, whose tops seemed covered with snow; at the bottom of those Hills lay a fruitful Countrey, besprinkled over with buildings of all sorts; his bases resembled the scales of Serpents, artificially represented by rich Stones of several prices, which here and there placed by the cunning workman, set forth to the life their natural spots: The reins of the Bridle were made into the form of two Dragons necks, that seemed to bite at bunches of Grapes, hanging at the horse mouth, which were onely the bosses of the Bridle, contrived into that resemblance, whilst the foam they cast about, appeared to be the poison of the Serpents; so that the bases representing their bodies, and their tails interwoven one within another, (which made the Crupper behinde) the Prince seemed to the Spectators, to have been intangled by those venomous Creatures: And the more were their fancies deceived, by reason that his Caparison was wrought, into the likeness of a turf of grass, all set forth with divers coloured silks, in some parts russet, and other where green, as if preserved from the Suns violence, by the neighbouring shrubs, contrived artificially in the workmanship. In his shield was pictured a King, with a drawn sword in one hand, and a whip in the other, whilest a multitude of common people appeared to beg his mercy; his intention being onely expressed by this Motto: However I will prevail by love . When the Prince had presented his service to Orsames , by the gallant mannaging of his Horse before his Throne, after his obeysance, he retired to a rich Pavilion, at one end of the Tilt prepared for his repose, where he expected an Adversary. The first that came to encounter him, was one Cosmo a neighbouring Prince, though he seemed to fetch his extraction from Italy ; his Armor was painted over with a stately Town, whose Pinacles of the Building being imbost in the workmanship, and richly guilded, the beams of the Sun gave not a more glorious then pleasant reflection to the beholders, whose eyes were a little dazled with the sight; his caparisons were cut out into the form of half Rocks, that seemed to have lost their aspiring tops, to give the City a fairer prospect, which covering a white Horse, he appeared not onely to be graced by those curious Ornaments, but his courageous deportment gave a wonderful delight to the spectators. In his Shield was pictured a calm Sea, with a brave Gally upon the quiet face of the water, loaden with Merchandize of all sorts, hanging over the sides of the Decks, accompanied with this Motto: This is my greatness . After the Champions had performed all circumstances required by the Laws prescribed them, finished their six courses with so equal a fortune, that it grew a hard question between the Judges, to which the Victory did justly belong; but because Orsames was loath so suddenly to break off the sport, he was content without any more dispute, that his Nephew the Prince of Arabia should still keep the Field, which priviledge notwithstanding Cosmo underwent with some grudging: however no defendant that entred that day into the List, was able to revenge his quarrell, which finished the exercise until the next morning, when the peoples early assembly, brought forth again as great an expectation; notwithstanding it was late before any appeared, untill at last a Knight called Fernezo , shot suddenly like lightening into the crowd, whose Armes were also of the same colour; but alas he wanted force to pierce the Princes honour: for at the third course he was carried a Spears length from his horse, which he conceived was a sufficient priviledge to warrant him to depart without taking leave, though he left many companions behinde him, that all run the same fortune: this success not onely concluded the actions of the second day, but began to spread abroad the Fame of the Prince, insomuch as every one prepared for the night revels with the Ladies, until the Princes necessary retirement from those sports, to give himself some convenient rest against the next tryal, invited the whole company to their several Lodgings: Nevertheless the challenger heated with his own glory, the next day came into the Field upon the first summons of Phoebus , who had newly guilded the tops of the Mountains in his own Countrey, before his Chamber Window, as an early call to his adversaries not to be slothful. But long he had not kept possession of the place where he had extreamly won the hearts of the people by his dexterious valour, before there appeared a Knight in a blew Armour, enlightned by the rayes of a bright shining Sun that seemed to the spectators, the representation of a clear heaven; his caparison and bases were wrought into a delightful piesage, where many flocks of Sheep seemingly, pastoured by a goodly Riverside; in his Shield he bore onely a Sheep-hook with this Motto: I have changed the Instrument : As he was quickly known to be Navariuus , that had married the fair Mantuina , so before he had made many courses, he was taught by the Princes valour, that there was more safety in his former profession; which fortune also hapned to many more, that endeavoured to encounter him; as namely Lorenseus Husband to beauteous Lawran ; and Fridius , who thought onely to have overcome by his choler with others of equal ambition: until about the latter end of the day, there suddenly started out two, at so even a distance to the eye of the Judges, that it was a question, which should have the preheminence in the encounter. The one was armed in a white Armour, artificially painted over with a short mantle of Tyrian Purple, that little more then covered his shoulders; his bases were embroidered with an orderly procession of Flamins , and other Priests clothed in white vestments; his caparisons were cut out into multitudes of Souldiers, mannaging their several weapons. In his shield was pictured a heaven, with a person in his religious habit at his prayers, though seemingly distracted by the tumults at his back, which was explained by this Motto; I cannot if I would . The other Knight was onely armed in green, with Bases and Caparison figuring oaken leaves, intermixt with Acrons of Gold: in his shield was set forth a brave Ship in full sail, though a black cloud behinde it, seemed to threaten a tempest, or rather shewed it had past a storm, exprest by this Motto, I speed me to my happiness ; both striving to be foremost in the Encounter, they disputed the Title, pretending each one to have the priviledge, for that they intended to defend (as they said) the admirable beauty of the Princess Cloria , Daughter to the King of Lydia : This discovery seemed so much to encrease their passion, by an appearing jealousie, that they presently drew out their swords, to maintain the rest of the quarrel; until the green Knight by his prevailing blow, stroke off the Helmet of the other, who appeared being disarmed, to be Philos the Nephew to the great Favourite, which as suddenly stopt the courteous hand of his adversary; so that Orsames moved by such an accidental difference, came himself into the lift, and by his own judgement, gave the prerogative of the first trial to the strange Knight, who, as he said, deserved it, both in regard of his being a Forreigner, and for that he had also by his fortune disarmed Philos . After the King, and the rest of the company, were again placed in their seats, the two gallant Champions performed their courses, with such an equall bravery, that as it procured an extraordinary delight to the people, so it raised some difficulty in the opinion of the Judges, to whom they should grant the prize; onely the Prince of Arabia in his last course lost one of his stirrups, which was the reason that the question was once more brought before the King, as the supream Judge of the sport: however the Prince, because he would overcome the strange Knight with his courtesie, though not with his Lance, prevailed so far with Orsames , that he might buy his friendship by the discovery of his person, unto whose honour he was willing to sacrifice the victory; hoping to purchase thereby, as he said, a greater Jewel, which was his acquaintance. With that the green Knight presently pulling off his head- piece, was known of every one to be young Narcissus , who understanding, that the admirable beauty of his dear Mistriss Cloria , was not yet maintained by any valour (though jealous he proved, when he found Philos undertake the defence) he dispenced with the inconveniency of his own wound, that appeared by his halting, and privately arming himself came into the List, either to be conquered or finish his adversaries glory. The unexpected discovery of Narcissus person after the Turnament, gave occasion to all the people, with a kinde of triumphal though confused acclamation, to express their extraordinary joy, in that none but be, as they said, who had subdued Osirus greatness, deserved the honour of those martial sports: however the gallant youth, esteemed his desires but half satisfied; until he had also in some sort procured the approbation of the beautiful Princess, since she alone he reckoned the sole period of his endeavours: Therefore when he had performed his humble respects to Orsames , according to the laws of the Titling, and the custom of the Countrey, he presently cast himself at the feet of his glorious Mistriss, with these words in his mouth: As it may easily be perceived, what a powerful influence, your rare perfectious have over all hearts and actions of men, so no doubt but the heavens in a particular manner, design to render you the admirable pattern of your sex, since your lustre not onely bath created in me a new ability, but the very power of your name, doth induce my noble adversary, to attribute to my small performance, those victories I never merited: therefore as your own goodness will daily invite you, to frequent the gods Altars, with your welcome and acceptable sacrifices, so must I beseech you, to vouchsafe this brave Prince such a congratulation, as may fully pay the score of my obligation, who freely hath bestowed upon me, that by no right whatsoever could I challenge. Cloria , although she spake her own inward content, in nothing but bashfull smiles; yet the sparkling earnestness of her fair eyes, sufficiently shewed how far her heart was taken, with the fortunes and bravery of her servant, insomuch as the whole multiude, cryed out presently for the solemnization of the ceremonies, belonging to their Nuptials; pretending the City of Memphis that had endured so long a siege, being at last delivered by the occasion of their loves, might in some sort enjoy the honour of such Triumph. This caused Orsames , to take the lovely Couple by the hands, with intention to perform the office himself: but Cloria rather conquering her inward passions, then giving way to her own desires, told her Uncle, that nature and education had taught her thoughts a better duty, then precipitately to give away her person in such an Assembly, without the privacy and allowance of those, who had as she conceived a principal right and interest in her disposal. The King, by reason of this strict prohibition from such an authority, was forced to desist from his purpose; however he could not in his minde, but much commend his Neeces temper and discretion: Yet poor Narcissus (who seemed at the instant, struck with some killing disease) finding his principal hopes thus in a moment blasted, when he thought he had had his happiness in possession, had not one word to utter, either of reproof or perswasion; so that he could not chuse, but extreamly blame such a rigid severity, until Cloria again by a gentle smile, gave him (as he thought) some new encouragement, though no otherwise, then like people brought upon the Scaffold ready to dye, might receive from flattering enducements, to be reprieved, being onely framed by their own indulgent fancies, without any other grounds; for alas, alas! Tyrant Honour, had so strong a predomination in Cloria's disposition, that death would sooner have been entertained in her wishes, then the least decorum belonging to her bashful principles, could have been omitted in her resolutions: In so much as all her faithful lover Narcissus was to expect for the present, was comfortable hopes of a future fruition: which soon conducted the whole company to the Castle, the place designed during Orsames stay, not onely for the glories of his Court, but for the recreation of all the other Princes, who spent the time for the most part, in casting what honours they could, upon the youthful Lovers, whilest in the interim Philostros , was employed in receiving and entertaining Ambassadours, that from all places came to congratulate his Masters Victories. But of the contrary Philos, Philostros Nephew, began by little and little, to engender dark clouds of discontent in his unquiet bosome, from whence proceeded at last, thoughts of hatred and revenge; not onely in regard of those sparkles of love, which had flown from the bright rayes of Cloria's beauty, but also, for that he found how all mens opinions, were transported beyond measure, to magnifie the gallant deserts of brave Narcissus , which (as he believed) did not a little overshadow his own former successes in the Wars. These distempers, I say, did not alone make him all day abstain from chearful company, but in the night time raised, for the most part, such extravagant fancies in his ambitious and working braine, that he remained in a manner continually tormented in his rest; however, he endeavoured all he could, to keep the passions from the knowledge of vulgar eyes; or at leastwise, the causes of them: but as love and envy are two properties, too violent to be supprest in a heart enflamed with pride and prosperity, when as their effects can hardly be protracted, Philos was induced, after he had in a sort taken counsel of his haughty thoughts, and digested them in the general, to comply with his resolutions, to fall upon wicked and ignoble designs, seeing no way else could possibly bring about his purposes, according to his own unruly appetites: And that was, violently to destroy the innocent and vertuous loves, between Cloria and Narcissus ; which conveniency and opportunity was granted him, by reason there remained certain messengers in the City of Memphis , sent from the Senate of Lydia , among other troops of Ambassadours, employed to complement Orsumes prosperity. To this effect, he made choice of one of them, not being willing to communicate his secrets to more, until he could finde a probable assurance, his project should heartily be entertained: as soon as this man repaired to his presence, after some usual speeches of kindness and flattery, he conducted him by the hand into a private Cabinet of his own, scarce visited by any person whatsoever but himself, being loath either to be discovered or interrupted; where, when he had made him sit down by him, with more then ordinary familiarity, he uttered his minde unto him after this sort. Sir, said he, as you cannot but know, by that prosperous progress, which Euarchus your King hath already made in his Wars against the Forces of your Senate at Sardis , that not onely the least assistance, but any small discountenance from Forreign Princes, will utterly destroy your endeavours towards the compassing of your ends, in bringing him to a conformity with your intentions, though the world be yet scarce acquainted with what you desire; so may you by evident demonstrations perceive, how far hitherunto, my Uncle Philostros hath complyed with your purposes, as well in rendring Orsames indifferent to your proceedings, both against perswasion, and his own inclination, as in seeming to countenance those actions of yours, which not onely appears destructive to his Tenents, but in a manner is against the very honour of his Family; for that Hyacinthia the Queen of Lydia ; is as you very well know, a branch of the Royal House of Syria: so that by these comportments, it is plain, what obligations you own the great Favourite, who carries with him almost the power of all Asia ; however perhaps you may be perswaded, he hath some other design in his heart, then barely your good, against which I will not dispute: yet by the way give me leave to tell you, that notwithstanding States-men, do not use to favour any cause or party, without their own Interest, to be considered in the first place; yet of the other side, when both benefits may go together, you ought not, either to examine the reason, or be any way backward to entertain the ocasion, but rather with violent wings of passion flye at the prosecution; concerning which, when I shall have understood your determination, you may know more of my minde. It was something long, before the Ambassadour returned him any answer at all, being as it were surprized between fear and doubt, what himself ought to think, or what the other meant to do; yet at last breaking through his seeming amazement, he delivered these words, with a humility answerable to the necessity (as he thought) his Masters had of his Uncles assistance; not onely to hinder any supplies, to be sent from the State of Syria to Euarchus , but to continue still the accustomed Commerce and Trade, between the two Nations, without which it was impossible for the Kingdome of Lydia to subsist. My Lord (said he) as it is well known, what most glorious effects the wisedome and industry of your great Uncle, have produced towards the welfare and prosperity of Syria , that in former times, continued so many years embroyled in Civill Wars, and Domestick Troubles, by reason of the power and inconstancy of the ambitious Nobility, who scarce gave their Kings rest and quietness from care and vexation, in regard of those hereditary commands they challenged, by a lasting descent from their proud Ancestors, not to be bridled by any endeavours and perswasion, which now I say by the gods goodness you have happily supprest: so cannot our present and well-minded Senate, but in a very high nature, not onely own all those signall favours, bestowed upon them by your most Illustrious family, in the prosecution of our late transactions with our Prince, (whom we still desire notwithstanding to love and honour, though he seem to be an utter stranger to our honest intentions) but humbly beg a continuance still of those benefits, as well by your countenance in the Kingdom of Syria , as for that you have so much interest amongst all the Princes of the lesser Asia , who appear onely to depend upon your fortunes and success: wherefore, since you have been pleased so far to declare yourself in the behalf of our Countrey, (the secret reason of which I shall no more examine, then what your wisdome shall be willing to reveal, to direct those services you would have us undertake to perform) I do faithfully promise before the immortal Gods, not onely to make my Masters acquainted with advantage, how great a happiness they may pretend unto, in the conserving intirely your affection to themselves, but also in using what other means they can, to become alwayes beneficial to your principle: And with these words offered to kisse his hands, with other protestations of his own humble endeavours upon all occasions. Philos by this discourse, with the seeming earnestness of the Ambassadour, finding in a manner he might be confident of his fidelity, when as also he had thanked him for such effectuall professions, he began againe with him to this effect. Then said Philos , since I suppose you have judgement enough to understand your own good, as well as to be grateful for our benefits, I will make the less difficulty to acquaint you with this story, upon which my desires must be grounded: within this great City of Memphis (newly as I may say conquered by Orsames fortunes, but in truth rather by Philostros policy) there remains a Lady of our house named Artemesia , whose beauty joyned with her other excellent endowments of nature (if it be not folly thus to speak of a sister) being considered, without a spiteful partiality against the honour of our blood, may merit the highest preferment in Asia : between this sister of mine I say, and young Narcissus the Duke of Cyprus Son, now present in these wars, there hath been formerly a Treaty of a Marriage; however their few years and the neglectful prosecution of their friends in those Times, gave it neither birth or much motion: It rested in this posture until this late Siege, that Artemesia being compelled by a certain kinde of a necessity, by reason of the removal of Philostros family into the Camp, was compelled to accompany her great Uncle; but since her arrival at Court, she not onely became an ear-witness of Narcissus comportment, but hath also been present at some of those atchievements and comportments of his, which for the present hath afforded him a competent opinion in the Army: whether his person or his fame have most taken her fancy I will not say. But these Inflammations joyned with the former Treaty, have created such an opinion in her thoughts, that she conceiveth her reputation to the world to be blemished, if Narcissus be suffered to offer his affections to any other but her self, without her privity and consent: In the interim nevertheless understanding, that the Queen of Lydia arriving by chance upon the Island of Cyprus , hath occasioned Narcissus to fall in love with the Princess Cloria , whereby she esteems her self slighted, and dishonoured, (not onely in regard of the former Treaty mentioned, but also in that any should appear in this Horizon, more worthy of respect then the Neece of great Philostros ) is grown desperate in her resolution: whether I may call her passions preposterous or no, I will not dispute; onely I may probably believe, that Narcissus loves to Cloria , are neither grounded upon right or reason, since as our Treaty, if not engagement, was begun upon more mature consideration, accompanied perhaps with some promises of either side; so can it not ever be thought, that the declining condition of Euarchus , will at any time bring happiness to the Island of Cyprus , much less to the Duke thereof; when as all the benefit he shall receive from such ambition, must be the exhausting of his treasure, and the endangering of his command: but however he and his son may apprehend the consequence of such a conjunction to themselves, yet no reason other Countreys should be debarred of their own advantages, when they shall be offered means to prosecute their particular: It is sufficient we think it not convenient either for your State or our Kingdome; which being for the most part, allowed common people of never so inferiour a rank, much more is it to be granted to Kings and Princes of the highest Dignity: If reasons of State shall break and make Marriages contracted by friends and kindred, what prerogative shall be denyed enemies to exercise one against another, when either danger or benefit appears in the consequence? the Gods do but unite hearts in nuptial tyes, for the commodity of men, and certainly all generals, are to be preferred before particular interests; which being granted as a maxime, and the proof demonstrated of the good or evil, in my opinion we ought not to stumble at the execution; for as in my own conscience I am satisfied in the right of our pretensions. So if you may make War with your King, because he doth not satisfie the publick, without any question you may also possess your selves of all that is his, by the same justice. To this purpose therefore be advertised: that as 'tis resolved by the Princess Cloria (notwithstanding Narcissus violent prosecution) not to make election of him, or any other for her Husband, without the full approbation of her Mother, so very probably may it be conceived, that the youth will be able to pretend fairly to her love, being in his own Countrey; when as he shall not onely have the commodity of sollicitation, accompanied by the remembrance of all those services he hath performed for her honour and safety; but also for that, it may be thought by Hiacinthia your Queen, that the marriage of her Daughter with Narcissus , may prove to be a benefit of extraordinary consequence to her Husbands business; when by that means she may think to procure money in his Wars from the Dukes Coffers, being engaged to the same quarrel in the right of his Sons Wife: besides, it is to be supposed (or at least wife will be so imagined) by those about the Queens Person, that the very interest of the Dukes power in the Island of Cyprus (by reason of the numerous shipping in their Havens) will upon all occasions be able to supply Euarchus necessities, either with Ammunition or Souldiers, according to the need he shall have in his intention, against your Senate at Sardis : and who knows not but Cyprus is a scituation, more proper for his affairs and assistance, then any other Countrey in Asia whatsoever? All which being considered, (though the interest of our family should not at all be concerned) you cannot be thought competent States-men, if you should not with all your endeavour, labour a breach of this intended marriage before it be past your reach and power to prevent: for probably the means will never again be so fairly presented unto your resolutions. The Ambassador, when Philos began to take a little breath, replyed; That as it was the greatest part of his own duty to hearken to all designs, that might any way advantage his Masters proceedings at Sardis , so would he not fail in his own particular, but to contribute the best of his endeavours, to render both him and his illustrious Family satisfied; hoping withal (as he said) that the Gods would largely assist to the protection of Lydia , and the prosperity of Syria , by such an indissolvable tye of friendship and commerce, that might make Orsames give laws to the rest of the world. Philos after he had made himself more confident, from the earnest protestation of the Ambassadour, went on with this discourse in this manner. These two (said he) pretended lovers, Cloria and Narcissus , (who rather may be esteemed fools in preposterous affection, then true politicians towards a well grounded and settled love, since as it may be thought, they neither fear prevention or provide against accidents) are now precipitately hasting their journey into Cyprus , where belike they hope to crown their wishes, with an entire happiness in every kinde can be desired; however they give out their supposed violence to be gone, proceeds from their passionate inclinations, to receive the benedictions of their parents, after so long a time of absence, from their company and presence: but whether it be so or no, (or rather their intentions are built upon their own private and secret resolutions one to another, which Cloria on her part is ashamed publickly to discover) I will not dispute; onely prevented they must be in their passage by Sea, and this cannot conveniently be put in execution any other way, then by your brave and invincible Navy, which will not onely absolutely take off all opinion of jealousie, in regard of your Senates difference with Euarchus ; but when you have by this means separated the young couple, and so by consequence destroyed their loves, you may have the benefit and commodity to dispose of the Princess person, to what match you shall think most probable for your advantages; whereas in doing otherwise (whether she marry Narcissus or no) it is likely to whomsoever she shall be contracted, both their obligations and promises must be grounded upon conditions, to assist Euarchus in his wars against your Senate; which perhaps may prove of too great a concernment, and prejudicial to your affairs: In short this is all I have to say unto you, until I know more of your minde. As the Ambassadour was very fearful to displease Philos , considering the need the Senate of Lydia had of his Uncles friendship, so of the other side he was most unwilling (if not partly resolved) not to undertake of himself, a business of such a dangerous consequence, where the Island of Cyprus might have any interest in the design; so that after something a long pause, as if he borrowed leave of his consideration to make a reply, he returned him this answer. My Lord (said he) although I would not have you in any kinde think, I either fall from my affections, or go from my professions; yet I must humbly beseech your goodness, I may propose to your wisdom these two doubts, that in regard I am but a messenger, must needs rest upon my thoughts, with some fearful apprehension, what I ought to do, in the quality of my office and imployment: The first is, with what security or probability can I undertake the design, unless I make my Masters at Sardis acquainted with each particular? who not onely must grant out their Commission to their Admiral at Sea; before any thing can be affected; but of the other side, are to provide a considerable number of Ships, to be able to contend (if any resistance should be made with those Vessels, that are commanded to wait upon the Princess in her Journey) the other to be satisfied, how the Duke of Cyprus should again be rendred pacified, after such a violence offered to a company, in whom he may challenge an interest, peaceably coming into his Countrey, from the Dominions of Orsames King of Syria: for however Cloria her self, may be esteemed a Subject of Lydia , being the Daughter of Euarchus , yet Narcissus will still be known to be the Son of the chief Commander of Cyprus , who therefore ought not to have tasted of the injury; whereupon of necessity, some dangerous consequence must follow, which perhaps our present Governours will be most unwilling to put to the hazzard. Philos by this reply, sufficiently perceived the craft and cunning of the Ambassador, that was not to be engaged, with any disadvantage for any party, notwithstanding all his violent and glorious professions: besides, by his discourse, he found (as he imagined) a great deal more affectionate desire in his thoughts, to entertain a firm correspondency with the Commonwealth of Cyprus , then with the State of Syria ; which upon any terms he was resolved to hinder, as conceiving it extreamly prejudicial to the interest of his own Nation; not onely in regard of the scituation of the Island, but also for that Cyprus formerly ever had, a most particular dependency upon the Kingdome of Syria , both for trade and protection: wherefore after a little time of silence, dressing his countenance with a certain kinde of scornful smile, as if not onely he contemned his doubts, but also disvalued his reasons; at the same instant taking him by the hand, and griping it something hard, as it were between kindness and choller, he delivered himself unto him in this manner. Alas poor men (said he) where are your courages and wisdomes? Truly for my part, I do not more wonder, how you durst with such low thoughts, undertake such desperate designs against your Prince, then now when you have made such a progress in them (as I may say past any retreat) you seem to stumble at small resolutions: no my friend be you assured, there is not any obstacle can so soon obstruct the full period of your designs, as the want of putting in execution this project; for by that omission, you do not onely afford your enemy Euarchus breath and assistance, by the certain supply he shall have from the Island of Cyprus , in regard of this marriage, but you are assured to lose a friend of our Family, who can most hurt you in these parts of Asia , not finding you willing to pleasure us, when the occasion is fairly offered into your hands: however that you may be converted, and made know that I perfectly perceive your errour, I shall in a few arguments, give some answer to your fears; for I see weak digestions must have light meats for their appetites, not onely to keep them from surfeit, but squemishness: I do the more willingly study your satisfaction in this nature, that if it be possible, you may perswade your Masters at Sardis to undertake this giant work with less difficulty: nevertheless I must also tell you, what is to be done, must be done presently, in regard the Princess presseth her departure with all violence. In the first place therefore, that you may send to your Senate, to acquaint them with the design intended, is not onely fit, but necessary; though withal I must warn you, that it ought not to be communicated, but to a few privately, lest being revealed, you not onely thereby lose the benefit of the project, but shall also contract more enmity of a ridiculous consequence against your proceedings, having falsly undertaken (as your adversaries will interpret) a business of this nature, that you had not understanding sufficient to prosecute to the end: This in like manner gives me intimation to advertise you, of onely two Ships providing for the young peoples transportion, the one for Cloria , the other for Narcissus: in the next place, whereas you pretend a fear, that the discourtesie shewed to the Duke of Cyprus Son, must probably raise a difference between your State and the Island of Cyprus , which you Masters would be loath to venture; I must inform you, in that you thew your selves but weak States-men, when as it is well known, by the practice of all the Laws of Asia , an enemy where he can upon the Seas, may prejudice another enemies particular, without an offence done to a third person; so that it is plain, you may seize upon your Kings Daughter in any posture you finde her, restoring all other free persons to the common right of Nations: besides, how is it possible the Duke should come to be informed of any design intended to either? wherefore this must be esteemed as a meer accidental encounter and no otherwise; especially when it is to be supposed your Senate at Sardis , could not take any notice of any private engagement between Cloria and Narcissus , and so consequently no just offence ought to be taken by the Island of Cyprus at such proceedings, knowing what differences are daily encreasing in the Kingdome of Lydia between the King and his Subjects: and further I must tell you, that as I interpret this project, chiefly executed for the advantage of our Family, so you may be sure to be kept in the favour of my Uncle, as if it had been onely effected in his particular, whereas in effect your Senate hath the sole benefit: 'Tis true, I must confess, some natural affection to my Sister, hath a little raised my passion, considering how that in her person, our house is something dishonoured; yet if other maximes of State were not to be preserved, and put in execution, by your undertaking this design, I should rather chuse to leave off the enterprise, then too violently and foolishly endeavour to satisfie a womans humour: further in this, I shall not need to reveal my self unto you, since it is sufficient, your Masters may gain by the bargain; and for the Dukes power to do you any considerable mischief, if he should have any such determination, you may easily free your selves from the apprehension of such terrours, Orsames great favourite being your friend; when as that Prince hath not onely his meer dependency upon our Court, but hath also purchased many honours, and other considerable fortunes in the Kingdome of Syria ; since of necessity, alwayes he must be circumscribed by our laws and pleasure, rather then by his own will and passion; besides I am confident, when he shall again have received his Son, freed from his fantastical love, and rambling adventures, he will easily be perswaded to believe, that he hath made by much a better exchange, then if he had been married to the Princess; who for her Dower, could have but brought the troubles of her Father, to have incombered if not ruined his House; especially when as presently upon this separation, the old propositions shall follow from my Uncle to the Duke, concerning a speedy match to be concluded (if he please) between my Sister Artemesia and his Son Narcissus ; which I am sure will far better content the people, who by nature neither love titles nor troubles, but rather expect gain and protection, which they have from us and cannot have by Euarchus: besides these reasons that I have given you for your fuller instruction, whereby you may be the better able to satisfie your Senate sitting at Sardis , I shall onely adde to your consideration this one particular: how is it possible for you to subsist in your contention against your King, if either we deny your trade in our Dominions, or withdraw from your assistance the mountainous Mysians , although we should not endeavour to set upon you, with any other mischief? so that these things being increased, by those disadvantages we can afford you, not onely in the discountenancies of other Princes, but in such forces we can readily send for the benefit of your King, I doubt not but you may be quickly convinced in your opinion, that your best policy will be, to comply with our occasions, since we can so easily as you see blow away all your attempts against Euarchus: with these words he offered to depart, as if he grew something careless of his resolutions. But the Ambassadour, however he was ambitious to have still retained Philostros friendship, without either engagement to Philos , or offence to any other State; yet finding that it was unpossible by any craft to compass his designs upon the greatest esteemed politician in Asia , so the time for the departure of the Princess Cloria , was expected to be so suddenly, that of necessity he was at the very instant, to declare some settled thing in his resolution, for Philos satisfaction and his own security: wherefore taking Philos by his Robe, a little to stay his course from going away from him, after he had thanked him, for the generous opinion he seemed to have of his own fidelity, to the service of his family, when he durst trust him (as he said) with a secret of such a nature and consequence; he vowed not onely, with as much industry and understanding as possibly he could, to make his Masters acquainted with the design, but also to be very sensible of the obligations, due from the State of Lydia to himself, whereby the Senate might be ready upon all accasions, to be serviceable to his Illustrious and most Noble Family, in requital of his many favours: when he had ended these complements (and probably they were not any otherwise to be esteemed, since for the most part Ministers of State, are not much troubled either with good nature or charity) he demanded of Philos , whether or no he should make his fellow Commissioners privy to any of these passages; for that (as he said) having equal authority with himself, it might else be imputed to him as an act either of presumption, or give cause of too great a suspicion, not to communicate the intentions to such Councels, before it was to be moved to the Senate of Lydia: for that, said Philos, if at any time these proceedings come to be laid to your charge as a crime, you may very well alledge, my desire was by way of condition to the contrary, in regard there were so many spies remaining of other Nations at Memphis , that scarce could it have been hid from publick knowledge: neither would I have many of your unnecessary Senators themselves, made knowing of such a secrecy between us; so cautious I am in that particular: but onely to be imparted to the Assembly called your Juncto, who as I understand, are the sole mannagers of all transactions of this nature, whether abroad or at home: This being also promised by the Ambassadour, he intimated that Philos would be pleased to protract as long as was possible, the departure of the young couple; not onely as he said, whereby his Masters might have the better conveniency, to digest all their resolutions, to the most advantage for the design intended, but also to have time sufficient, whereby he himself might be truly informed from Sardis (by some of his own particular friends) in what nature the Senate was disposed in the prosecuting of their purposes, either against their King or any other Nation. When Philos had condescended to all the desires of the Ambassadour, having first as may be supposed rendred him fully satisfied in very many particulars in State policy, which the messenger before had neither learned or understood, they took their leaves of one another, with such an entire embracement, as if their bodies were perpetually to be joyned in nature, as their souls were combined in the destructive designs, to the poor lovers felicities: but now Philos being left alone, with a strong confidence of the wished success of his unhandsome project, he pleased himself sufficiently with the consideration, how much he found the Ambassadour inferiour to his skill, in political rules; for that by a contrary stratagem, it seemed to him easie, to destroy all the Lydian Fleet, if he did not conceive, that the affecting of this enterprise, would be much more advantageable to his other affairs; and at the worst he knew, it was in his power by discovering the design, before it was acted, to create such a jealousie between the two common governments, as would alwayes make them at odds one against another, to the commodity and benefit of Orsames Kingdom; which could not any way be over-powred, but by the conjunction of those two Nations at Sea, who onely abounded in multitude of Shipping; which however he intended to put in practise, when he had compassed his own ends upon them both: In the mean time he was content, to let the Lydian Ambassadour, not onely to play with his own thoughts, but to become instrumental for some season to his purposes; that were upon the surprisal of the Princess Cloria , and the separation of her love, to demand Euarchus Daughter of the Senate for his Wife; not doubting but the suit would be easily granted, in regard of that friendship, they desired to maintain with his Uncle Philostros ; and then also, to make the like motion to the Duke of Cyprus concerning a Marriage to be made between his Son Narcissus , and his own Sister Artemesia , which he conceived might be done without the least suspicion that he had any former hand in the design; for he knew the Ambassadour durst not reveal the secret publickly, lest it might be suspected himself to have combined or plotted the discourtesie, offered to the Island of Cyprus , in the violence used at Sea to Cloria and Narcissus ; and at the worst he supposed, he could deny at his pleasure any such thing by him contrived, though the Ambassadour should affirm it. Philos now having eased (as I may say) the heavy weight of that burthen, which he found lay continually upon his confused thoughts and working fancy, not onely by reason of his love to Cloria , but his hate to Narcissus , began also to think, that dissimulation from that time forward, would be a most necessary companion to all the rest of his actions, since as already, he had betrayed the lovers felicities in his own determinations, so were they, with others of Orsames Court, to be kept as much as might be free, from all suspicion and jealousie, until the grand project contrived between him and the Ambassadour, (who undertook to be the Messenger himself) might have a fitting conveniency to be put in execution, which he could not yet be certain of, until the return of his desire should come from the Senate of Lydia: In the interim he had warned the Ambassadour, not to use his name to his Masters, in the particularity of the design; but rather to seem as if the consideration, had onely moved from his own intelligence (being at Memphis ) of the departure of Cloria and Narcissus: nevertheless to ingratiate himself the more in their belief, he wished the Ambassadour in the general, to intimate to his Masters at Sardis , how great a friend Philostros his Uncle intended to be, not onely to their Nation, but also to their proceedings: In prosecution of this intention of dissimulation, Philos put on a better countenance in all manner of societies, then he was accustomed; intermixing himself with the most delightful company, both of the Town and Court; and to this purpose, he would not onely often go a hunting of Estriges, according to the frequent use of the Countrey, in the wilde deserts bordering upon the Confines of Egypt , attended by many of the ordinary sorts of people, but perswaded the King himself, to celebrate in an ancient Theatre near the Pyramides, the magnificent sports of fighting with Lions, and other ravenous Beasts of Africa ; chiefly with an intention, to entertain the youthful thoughts of Cloria and Narcissus that they might not so violently think upon their intended journey into Cyprus : Amongst all these projects contrived in his brain, one day when Orsames was a hunting, he addrest himself to Narcissus particularly, intending a little to feel his inclinations, or rather I may say, to perswade his judgement, contrary to the very maximes of his heart, where in a most familiar way he used this kinde of discourse unto him. My Lord, said he, it seemeth strange unto me, how the glory of your youth and valour can be confined to any other region in the world then Syria ? where not onely worth is best understood, but vertue from thence seems to take her Birth and Original; for in truth other Nations appear but to practise by her imitation and example: Sciences there I must tell you, are taught new rules to walk by, whilst admiration stands at amaze, to behold more then could be thought were possible, for both art and nature to produce to mans capacity to understand: if you look at the Court, you may see how riches and honour go hand in hand, to work visible miracles in the eyes of all strangers, imagining during their abode there, they remain rather in some inchanted palaces, then in earthly dwellings, since beauties are so numerous and excellent of both sexes, that the variety in a manner confounds the apprehension: If the streets of Damascus be considered in each particular, what can be more magnificent to the view, then to see guilded and triumphant Chariots, filled with Nymphs and Ganimedes, ride through multitudes of popular acclamations, for great Orsames continued prosperity? youth there in Academies, are taught such civility and knowledge, that they are rendred men in all perfections, whilst they seem scarce to be yet borne for their years: there I must say, sacrifices flye, with so much zeal up to the heavens, from the Altars of those Temples, where reverend Priests are ever attending, to discharge religiously those offices, appointed them by the immortal Gods, as cannot but procure prosperity to our Nation: The Victories of our Armies dispersed over all Asia , make not onely Wonder at a stand, but even Fame it self weary with sounding: The martial glory of Orsames after his conquests, is a spectacle not more terrifying, then delightful to common spectators, that are not able to understand the Theory of his greatness: In fine, our Ladies there in assemblies, want not confidence, to make their beauties appear to the most advantage, and yet all is so varnished over with a bashful modesty, as if nature onely had learned an art to be best becoming; in discoursing they seem to be the fairest Syrenes , without any intention at all of deceit, onely by a noble power, they force men to be their captives, because vertue and honour, know not where again to be so well satisfied, as in that imprisonment: if our laws and policies be observed, they rather teach preventions, by their threatned severity and wise cautions, then have any intention in their constitutions, either to destroy or circumvent people; all which being considered, I see no reason why your excellent vertues, accompanied with an age not yet exceeding eighteen, should want those justifiable ambitions, as not violently to covet against all obstacles such rarities, that can onely bestow upon you lustre and greatness, when as the contrary perhaps, will render you less famous then you are; for nothing, but because you have not yet tasted personally of those perfections in Syria , though granting in your own particular, you are already furnished with them, in a large measure beyond other people: but perchance you may say you have not onely seen Damascus already in passing by; but the glory of Orsames in these Wars, which I must tell you, is no other then to behold beauties in the night, or the King in his eclipsed splendor: all which my Lord I onely say, to give my self the greater happiness, by enjoying still your company, not knowing but these motives, might divert your present intentions from Cyprus , with that excellent Lady the Princess Cloria , whom you seem to conduct, which office I cannot deny, but in it self is a most supreme happiness; but, since it may be conceived both the Duke your Father, and the Queen your Mother, would be glad of the occasion, in their own persons to visit Orsames Court: Methinks you may have reason enough to alter your resolution. When he had done Narcissus answered him in this manner. O Sir, said he, you are mistaken, a stronger influence a great deal, draws both my thoughts and person into the Island of Cyprus , then all those rarities, you have numbred up in the Kingdome of Syria , since one perfect carbuncle (by whose light I must sail) is more worth then, then a thousand other stones of less value: And if you would behold beauties indeed, look upon the fair Lillies and Roses in Cloria's cheeks, whose dainty mixtures in the whole, appear to be a sweet and heavenly Garden, composed of such Flowers, that the earth cannot parallel either in taste or colour; whilst her fair eyes are two powerful suns of equal brightness, that can illuminate all places of the world alike, though never so much darkned by natures malice, if she but there vouchsafe her presence: her perfections I say are books sufficiently instructive, to teach the world knowledge and science, in which are to be daily read, multitudes of several varieties of that excellency, that greatest Doctors know not how to define them, but in loves Academy: when she moves, you may behold a certain shining throne of sanctity, whereon are placed Altars in abundance, whereon are onely Sacrifices offered to her self, of wounded hearts that need compassion; when as in the interim her Musick, when she pleaseth, charmeth mortals with a ravishing delight, to such extasies of pleasure and content, that they seem to be ambitious of no other happiness: you speak of glorious victories gained by your powerful Armies; when as every look of hers, is able to conquer whole Nations without resistance; and Favourites to Kings, must of necessity become slaves in those triumphs: These last words could not chuse but reflect upon Philos , apprehending that either Narcissus had some inckling of his intentions, or that a Divine Inspiration had secretly instructed him in his thoughts and desires, wherefore at the instant, he began to blush, with a certain kinde of inward guilt, that proceeded from his apprehension rather then his judgement: for the Gods knew, Narcissus onely spake, by the meer instigation of his own partial affection, produced from the flames of his constant and vertuous love, hearing Philos utter such vanities, in commendation of his own Countrey, to the disparagement of all other places. But how this discourse, or rather Dialogue would have been concluded between them, cannot well be determined, since a great Panther belonging to those deserts, lying secretly in certain shrubs by the side of a Pool, not onely for the present, interrupted them, but violently flew upon Philos , as he rode along with Narcissus ; which quickly overturned both him and his horse, to the apparent danger and hazzard of his life, but that Narcissus having a small hunting Spear in his hand, quickly stroke the Beast so fortunately in the breast, that the blood soon followed the wound in great abundance; however the furious, or I may say rather valiant creature, seemed so little to be discouraged by the stroke, that with an appearing outward rage, to finde himself so assaulted contrary to his expectation, looking first upon Narcissus , as if he either challenged him with unkindness or ingratitude, for having attempted him without any provocation, and then turned his eyes again upon Philos , as if yet he made some question in his thoughts, whether he should release his seeming conquered Captive, or be revenged upon his injurer, at last flew at Narcissus with such a spight and violence, as not onely put him to his best defence, but undoubtedly had prevailed exceedingly to his prejudice, if Philos had not hastily disingaged himself from the inconveniency of his fall, and made haste to his assistance; as fearing else, his own death might follow, which soon obliged them all three to a most sharp and desperate combat: and however the Panther received multitudes of wounds by their industry, insomuch as it was unpossible for him to escape destruction, yet with his clawes, seising by chance upon the left Arme of Narcissus , he made in it so deep an impression, that he tore part of the flesh from the bone, shewing that he was even ambitious of revenge in his last end; for presently in a staggering manner (not having strength sufficient remaining, to support any longer his own body, which one might perceive his courage was loath to confess) he fell backward upon his tail, and so rested for a great space, panting and blowing with open mouth: but both Narcissus and Philos , not being very willing to complement with his intentional fury, gave him so many others stroaks in all parts, that not long it was before they left him for dead, in the interim many of the huntsmen coming into the place: but the beast, as if he yet retained some vigour or malice in his heart, notwithstanding for a long time there appeared no life at all in him, whilst the company were discoursing severally of the accident and encounter, and applying some remedies to stop the bleeding of Narcissus wounded Arme, the Panther of a sudden, not onely again revived, but flew violently upon one of the Dogs lying near him, and bit him so, that the blood followed, which in a manner startled the whole company thinking him to be dead, wherefore again they set upon him, though with a jeasting violence, until at last they made him sure from doing any more hurt to them or any others. However this unexpected wound which Narcissus had received in his Arme, from the sharp claws of the Panther , was not esteemed by himself, either dangerous or worth much consideration; yet by way of conveniency if not necessity, both he and the Princess Cloria were forced for some time longer, to put off their journey to the Island of Cyprus , which seemed much to comply with the contrived design of Philos , for their surprisal at Sea by the Lydian Fleet; since for some dayes, Narcissus not onely kept his Chamber but his Bed, which however afforded him many visits from all the youthful Nobility of the Court, as I may say in some sort seemingly glad of the accident, whereby he might by reason of that necessity, be still obliged to remain in their company: this cure of his, protracted the time so long, that the season of the year drew on, for the ceremonious cutting of the Banks of the River of Nilus , whereby the whole Countrey of Egypt might be flouded, to augment its fertility, or rather to take away the natural barrenness of the soil, which would be occasioned by such omission: To this work of industry, belonged certain triumphs, that had been time out of minde instituted, by the ancient Kings that governed the people; which custom, as the inhabitants (by a certain kinde of superstition in their dispositions) every year most religiously observed, as believing in some sort their wealth would increase with their devotion; so Orsames himself, whereby the better to retain the affections of his new conquered Subjects of that Nation, was perswaded, not onely to be present at those sports in person; but Philos thinking it also a most opportune occasion to demonstrate his Uncles greatness, resolved to entertain that night, the whole company of Princes at Memphis , in a most magnificent manner, though his chief intentions were to see, whether he could by that means, the sooner disjoyn the affections of Cloria , to whose honour he seemed to consecrate his feast, whereby more particularly, to bestow the loves both of her self and Narcissus , upon him and Artemesia , by reason of a certain kinde of lustre, domineering as might be thought more in their family, then any others visible in Asia , in regard of Philostros intimacy and power with Orsames: these were his fantastical thoughts, grounded onely upon opinion and his own ambition, when as the vertuous loves between Cloria and Narcissus , were established upon Diamond Rocks, not to be shaken by any blasts of greatness or fortune. When the day came for this mighty ceremony (the people being assembled upon the banks of the River) the whole afternoon was spent, in the taking and destroying of Crocodiles , which with certain baited hooks of Iron, were by their huge bodies drawn out of the water, to the no small amazement of those strangers that had never seen the like before: The young men also of the Town in new Barges made for that purpose, offered many delightful sports, in a kinde of a rural triumph before the Castle; where also was the great Cestern, which hath been formerly mentioned in taking the Fort, marking out to the Inhabitants the rise and fall of the River, by which conjecture the fertility and scarcity of the years appear. This Cestern they not onely adorned with many Garlands, and preparations for Fire-works, but Roxana's Dwarf, that had been so great an actor in the surprisal of the Castle, was upon an open Theater presented to the view of the people, casting out to their expectations Orsames bounty: all which notwithstanding were designed for no other then preparatives for the nights ceremonies. At what time Philos , according to the circumstance of his invitation, conducted the Princess Cloria to his Lodgings, in full opposition to the other Castle, with the rest of the noble company then remaining at Memphis ; and however Narcissus felt some incommodation, in regard of the wound he had so lately received, without any great importunity was perswaded by Philos to be of the same society; it being in some sort also intended for his entertainment, that he might not onely be an eye-witness of the glory of Philostros family, but (as the sequel will testifie) have a view of his intended Mistress Artemesia, Philos Sister, having never during his abode at Memphis beheld her person, though for what reason was not known by any. The room that was designed for the Feast, was perfectly Oval, crowned on the top with a brave Cupelo , according to the antick Egyptian manner, adorned almost all over, with ancient Hieroglyphicks in Mosaick work: the Galleries of each side for the commodity of musick, were wrought into several intricate knots of guilded brass, intermixt with other colours, for the more beauty of the eye: the table it self also answered exactly to the Oval proportion of the room, leaving a convenient space from the wall, for the commodity of necessary attendants: it was in the middle hollowed in a large measure, to take off a part of its bredth, the company onely being appointed to sit, without any opposition to one another: however, in that seeming vacancy of the board, was erected from the ground a most stately Fountain, (that at least reached half way to the upper part of the cieling) where appeared, the Goddess Diana and her Nymphs bathing themselves, cut out in most excellent white Marble; which being also intermingled with certain artificial Trees, according to the nature of the Countrey, it afforded a most delectable prospect to the beholders; and the rather, for that the Fountain being built in a seeming Cristal Lake of clear running water, brought thither by the ancient Kings of Æ gypt , with infinite charge and admirable skill, not onely proved exceedingly to be a commodity to the Feast, but a refreshment to the company: especially for that from their seeming naked breasts, there continually run into several small vessels appointed for that purpose, all sorts of excellent Wine, both Greek and African; where dainty boyes stood ready to dispose of it to the strangers, when any pleased to call for a taste of each sort: the company at the first entrance into the room, seemed to be a little amazed at such a magnificent beauty, which they knew not of to be before in Memphis ; though the building had not onely long time ago, been erected by the greatest Monarchs of those parts, but the place it self had for many years past, been reserved superstitiously by the inhabitants, for no other use, but for the celebration of the day and night, when the banks of Nylus were to be opened, to let in the water over the Countrey. Thus they continued casting their eyes about at several varieties, (the Musick in the interim, meeting with the concavity of the fabrick, to the best advantage to the ear) whilest of a sudden, there flew open a two leaved door, that directed its prospect, through a large and long Gallery into another room, at the upper end of which, appeared a Lady sitting on a Throne; however at such a distance, that her countenance could not be perfectly distinguished; but being soon conducted by Philos towards the place, she was quickly discovered by his information, to be his sister the most fair Artemesia ; at leastwise so esteemed in her own opinion: and truly was so in effect, if her minde had in every kinde been answerable to her body, since any way wanting the inward beauty, some defect of necessity must be in the whole; and so consequently not most fair: Upon their approach, they found her incompassed by many Negro slaves, who with huge Fans in their hands, appeared to give her breath and refreshment: but why onely so accompanied, could not well be imagined, unless it were by the blackness of her attendants, the better to set forth her own beauty in the apprehension of the spectators? when they came at something a nearer distance, (for before she would not seem to rise) in a certain kinde of careless posture, she descended from her Throne, whilest the lovely Princess Cloria , (with another kinde of quickness in her carriage, made up between courtesie and good nature, wherein pride had not the least interest) addrest her self to give her an affable and fitting salutation, proceeding not onely from the gentleness of her disposition, but gratitude in her thoughts, in that her brothers entertainment, was wholly upon the matter (as was pretended) intended for her welcome and reception. Nevertheless Artemesia met her with such a countenance, as if she yet made some question, which of both was to be esteemed the person of most dignity; however at last Artemesia gave Cloria the better hand, though with that demeanour, that did more divulge her insolency, then shew her judgement to all the assembly: but self-opinion, when onely governed by an imperious soul, accompanied with passion and prosperity, can have no other cure, but either by destruction in effect, or contrary fortunes in possession: but all this, as it should seem, was to gain a heart from poor Narcissus , that was already captivated by a stronger influence; who, though he had understood her meaning, could not have been brought, from sacrificing to vertue and goodness, to have committed idolatry before a painted image; wherein was contained, as might be thought, nothing but pride and vanity. To be short, these ridiculous passages in a ceremonious march, conducted them to take their places. The Feast it self did not exceed more in sumptuous magnificence, then in exquisite curiosity: for the fruits seemed rather all growing upon natural Trees, then conveighed to their taste by industry; whilest birds of all sorts in the interim, flew about the room, warbling forth such variety of notes to entertain the company, as if they had been taught their skill by excellent masters. And the more admirable it was, in regard the clarity of the place, by reason of an artificial splendour newly created, proceeding from divers places in the room, rendred their several colours to the view, more beautiful then they were by nature ordained. It were a kinde of gross simplicity to talk of abundance, when as the power of Syria , joyned with the fertility of Egypt , conjoyned with a full, if not (as I may say) an omnipotent ability, to perswade love, and shew greatness. But however this entertainment seemed to be the provision of many ages, and the Feast intended for some years continuance, yet that nights ceremony (though customary in it self, yet at the present, ordained for the sight of the greatest esteemed Monarch in Asia ) could not wait upon any other intention or conveniency; wherefore the company being advertised, that Orsames with his Favourite in the other Castle, were already seated, expecting the shew, in something a confused manner rise from the Table, leaving all other services behinde to be recommended onely to fancy and imagination; since every one hasted to those windowes upon the River, that were most convenient for their purposes: for that already the fire flying in the air, and the Trumpets soundiug upon the Land, appeared to sense, as if the Heavens had changed their stations: for as the night seemed to be day by a contrary, though a more illustrious reflection, so mortals might be thought to have assumed to themselves the property of gods, in regard of the resplendent glory of the King, who sate upon the top of the great Castle, encompassed about with such multitudes of lights, and that variety of attendants, that he seemed not onely to be the conquerour of the earth, by a just right, but even to claim an appering and divine interest, of something miraculous during his time here below. In fine, nothing could be seen more splendent for the time; which drew all the eyes of the people upon his glory, with such an amazed joy, that scarce could they with hearts and cries, abstain from open Idolatry: but notwithstanding all these enticements of sense, Artemesia (however more bewitched in her passions then any other) could not be perswaded, either by her brother, or the rest of the company, to be at all a spectator of those sports: but whether out of a vain imagination, that she seemed in her thoughts to contemn every popular spectacle, as being a great deal below her aims and designs? Or whether she could not brook the competition of Cloria's beauty and dignity? Or indeed was truly melancholy as Philos had informed the Ambassadour, it is not to any great purpose to determine: onely it was visible that in a kinde of a disdainful posture, she without any manner of salutation to the company, retired suddenly into her Camber. Notwithstanding all these passages, Philos , whose heart and thoughts were already too violently set upon his own particular concernments, (however he found more cause of despair every day then other, of parting the young Lovers affection, although he might by the success of his designs sever their persons, and had made his sisters preposterous passions, in part, as a stale, the better to compass his own ends, though he would have been most willing also, to have rendred her entirely satisfied, in regard the contrary (as he thought) something conduced to the dishonour of the Family) began a little to consider what he should do at the present: wherefore beacuse he would leave no way unattempted, that might pretend to probability, and finding the Princess Cloria at a window alone, earnestly beholding the fire-works, and other pastimes, answerable to the season, which seemed something convenient for his purpose, he began a discourse to her in this nature, as he had formerly done a hunting to Narcissus , although the noise of the people below upon the banks of the River, seemed not very well to comply with his intentions. Madam, said he, you may here behold in part, the infinite glory and happiness of the King your great Uncle, in his own proper Sphere, the rich City of Damascus: but presently finding she could not perfectly understand what he said, by reason of the cryes and shouts of the multitude, though he perceived an inclination in her courteous disposition, to hearken to the matter of his discourse, as well as the sound of his word, drew her by little and little from the window, until they were both retired to such a distance, that they had free liberty, to understand what each other would deliver, which made him begin again in this manner. Truly, said he, since these magnificencies now beheld, are no better then meer shadows, to what brightnesses Orsames enjoys in his own Countrey, (of which you have already a large share by birth, being sprung from that flourishing tree, of the Illustrious and Royal House of Syria , and ought to have more in my opinion by possession, in regard of those rare perfections, which both art and nature have so liberally bestowed upon your self, to the wound of your Sex) I cannot be but something amazed, if not scandalized how your thoughts can carry you into any other Region, (especially having such conveniences) before you had tasted of those excellencies in Syria , that may not again be so well understood and apprehended, as by such curious fancies as yours, that are able even to adde a new life both to them, and to every thing else you see and hear: I must tell you most admirable Princess, that the Nobility of Syria in their own proper Elements, appear rather like so many Sovereign Lords themselves, crowned with honour and respect, then subjects to any mortal King whatsoever, by reason of their commands and dependencies, not any way to be equalled, or made less by what power soever, (continuing in Orsames favour) but as their own retirements, sometimes give them appetites for private recreations, whereby they become familiar and solitary; Alas, dear Madam, said he, did you but behold the glorious Palaces of Damascus , with other rich buildings of lesser note, (onely appointed to be the habitations of Merchants) you should think this great esteemed City (so much extoll'd by the boasting Æ gyptians ) to be but an unfurnished Village, in regard of its magnificence and splendor: and for the the Island of Cyprus whither you are now going, (which I must confess I admire; since the Queen your Mother by your attraction, would suddenly be induced to visit Syria ) ought to be esteemed in your view and apprehension, a poor and contemptible part of the world, onely ordained to breed up a few petty persons, of no honour and birth, as common drudges through the world, whereby to maintain the better trade and commerce for the benefit of our people; which Countrey notwithstanding (without Syria's immediate assistance) can neither defend it self in time of War, or preserve it self in time of Peace: To this greatness and prosperity of the Syrian State, as I will not say my Uncle Philostros , gives our flourishing fields greenness, or causeth the earth in due season to produce bountifully to the Inhabitants, yet I may boldly affirm, that his faithful policy hath rendred. Orsames great and mighty, and so consequently his subjects happy and fortunate; other people being over-run by their enemies, whilest we make War in all Countreys to our advantage, though but in part demonstrated by this City, not onely as you see made subject by strong hand to our power, but in the Inhabitants, being perswaded upon the matter in a moment, willingly to obey our laws and jurisdiction, as the great acclamations of joy, now offered to Orsames prosperity, in the present Feast of cutting the Banks of the River doth witness: by Syria I say you shall be honoured as a Goddess, and in Cyprus you cannot be maintained as a Princess; in the one your worth will be lost for want of knowledge, when as the other shall give you more value, in regard there are beauties also worthy of esteem; the rich Palace of Orsames , can afford you a habitation fit for your Dignity, when all Cyprus shall scarce grant you convenient entertainment: with these words taking her fair hand as the last period of his discourse, he bestowed as many Syrian complements upon the subject, as would have created it an Idol, if Cloria had been any way indulgently superstitious in her own concernment. But as the sweet Princess took these glorious expressions of Philos , (not being any whit suspitious of his inward intentions) as meer gallant Courtships, whereby to furnish out the rest of his entertainments, (though she could not but have reason as she thought to smile at his vanity) so of the other side, hearing, as she imagined, rather blasphemies then disgraceful speeches uttered, not onely against that Countrey, she had already partly resolved to make her own, but as it were in disparagement of the honour of that noble Family, from whence her dear Narcissus was extracted, which she knew yielded to none in Asia , either for personall worth or antiquity in descent, could scarce forbear the returning him a most sharp reply, however again considering, the pretensions of his magnificent entertainment, to be as it were wholly consecrated for her satisfaction, she let his words pass at the present, either as high flown expressions, proceeding from his passionate youth, whereby himself might become the better esteemed, or from some customary discourse or volubility of tongue, incident to the nature of his Countrey-men; yet would not abstain from telling him, (though in a kinde of a jearing way) that as her own small experience, in the glory and bounty of many places in the world, bestowed upon them by the Gods favour, or natures partiality, was not of a knowing confidence sufficient, to judge of their valours, (which made her really in her own thoughts, satisfactory contented, with what she hath already seen in some States, and was in part born unto in her Fathers Kingdom) so should she ever hold it, but a fitting obligation belonging to her duty, first by her personal presence in the Island of Cyprus , to enquire after her mothers pleasure, and then to be absolutely directed by her will, either to wait upon her into Syria , or to any other Region where she should command; which also was delivered with such a kinde of Vermilion blush, as very well demonstrated, that rather anger then bashfulness, exacted from her that beautiful Tincture. Philos scarce expected from her reply such an answer; yet putting on in his countenance, a certain confident smile, made up between displeasure and the opinion he might have of the Princess want of experience and breeding, to deal with him in discourse, continuing still notwithstanding his intention to mix some flattery with his words, he quickly made her this return: O Madam, said he, do not so injuriously tax your own judgement, but rather lay it upon the obstinacy of your will, which is a property I must confess, incident in a most high measure, to all those of your Sexes; that is, not to do a thing, because you will not do it, and not for that reason, and consideration tells you, it may be the best. Truly Sir, answered the Princess, as I thank Gods, I finde not in my own nature, such an obstinacy as you speak of, so cannot I yet be diverted from these maximes, that I have learned in my youth: which are, that obedience to my Parents, and a contentedness in disposition, ought to be esteemed neither folly or impiety, but of contrary, wisdome and goodness: I confess the same, replyed Philos ; but when the one may be conserved, and the other encreased, certainly we ought alwayes to apply our endeavours, to the greater commodity and benefit: as for example, if you now go along in the company of your great Uncle Orsames to Damascus , you shall not onely with a world of honour and respect gain those experiences, of beholding the excellent rarities of the earth; but the Queen of Lydia your Noble Mother, no doubt will be sent for with all expedition, both to accompany your fortunes and content. Cloria having formerly heard by discourses from the Queen and others, that Philostros, Philos Uncle, was not onely a main obstructer of her Fathers designs, but was also absolutely against her Mothers comming into Syria , could not forbear, but plainly to tell him her thoughts in that partiular, with some tears in her eyes, as if her apprehensions anew, began to work towards the affairs of Euarchus her father in Lydia: insomuch as he might easily perceive, there rested in her minde (notwithstanding other diversions) certain discontented motions, concerning his Uncles usage of the Queen in her distresses, not having so much (as she was informed) as ever invited her into Syria , notwithstanding all the misfortunes and oppressions of her own Countrey; but rather was a means to divert Orsames her brother, from either giving her countenance or reception; though grounded principally (as it was conceived) upon his spleen, that Anaxia the old Queen of Syria , had been so nobly entertained in Lydia , having been banished from her Sons Court, onely by his power and greatness. What the sequell of these discourses would have produced, cannot well be imagined, for that divers of the company being already sufficiently tyred with beholding the fire-works, were retired into that part of the room, where Cloria and Philos were discoursing; which for that time not onely ended the dispute, but took off all occasion to begin anew, neither indeed was there any commodity at all for it, since the whole assembly one with another, fell into diversity of pleasant communications, which in truth was a great deal more proper for the season then those of another nature, that had happened onely by accident; though of the other side, they might be occasioned by reason of Philos passions and underhand designs: however the company continued confusedly mixt both in persons and language, until they were invited into another room, to taste the delicacies of a Banquet, provided for their nights refreshment, that appeared not more curious then magnificent, as it were designed to close up their expectations, with the reality of what was again unpossible to be parallel'd by any other Nation: it might be esteemed an impertinent vanity, to dwell here again upon descriptions, since not onely by what hath been already said, the rest in part may be imagined; but the time of the night also calling the company to their rest, may very well give a full period to Philos sumptuous entertainment, though in them according to his expectation, he found not his wishes satisfied; neither in his own violent affections to Cloria , nor his sisters preposterous passions concerning Narcissus: which was the occasion, that being retired into his private Chamber, instead of sleep, he became incumbred with diversity of troublesome thoughts. Philos , as I say, being withdrawn into his own solitary lodgings, (in imitation of the rest of the company to the outward view, though not to the same intention, according to his inward disturbances) began more seriously to reflect upon his purposes, considering not onely the progresse he had made in them, but the issues consequently were probably to follow: To this effect in the first place, he found it was unpossible to remove the settled affections, between the young Lovers Cloria and Narcissus , as well by the manner of discourses he had made to them both, in the commendation of the Syrian excellencies, as by divers other reasons and circumstances, that he had observed in either; which made him believe, as the combinations he had made with the Ambassadour, would prove to little effect for his benefit, so would they be of most desperate concernments to those sweet and innocent creatures: next he laid before his remembrance, not onely the gallant bravery of Narcissus person, in many attempts he had made at the siege upon the Egyptians , having withall in a manner saved the life of his Uncle Philostros in the fight, as at another time his own from the fury of the Lion ; but also more particularly, he reflected upon the courteous disposition of the Princess Cloria , notwithstanding her dignity and quality, accompanied with her excellent beauty and rare perfections, not to be equalled again in all Asia . Lastly, he considered with some horror, what a world of inconvenience his family had brought upon Euarchus and his Kingdom of Lydia ; not onely at the first, by stirring up of the ungrateful Myssians to contend with him, but also in discountenancing of Hyacinthia the Queen, in her solicitations with Orsames her Brother for her Husbands Interest, however there seemed to appear no other reason for these latter evils, but that Anaxia the old Queen of Syria , (being in disfavour with Philostros ) had been received by the Court of Lydia , with some more then ordinary affection and ceremony. These considerations after a long debate privately in his own bosome, made him at last utter this language. O Heavens, said he, with what a Torrent of impious madness, are mortalls carried on in their courses, when they stear their actions onely by ambition, and fill she sails of their intentions, with nothing but violence and pride? O wise moderation that should temper the heat of all our passions, and make us rather good then politick, to what Region art thou flown, to seek vertue and quiet? What if our endeavours could attain every day to new Conquests, until the world should become ours by the sword, accompanied with blood and slaughter? What were the purchase worth; still living in distempers and vexation? Doth more Titles any thing else, but serve to create new appetites, which daily encrease without satisfactions? What serve command and greatnesse, but to inflame desires, that torment day an night our over-indulgent thoughts, with restlesse labours of such impatiency, as absolutely destroy those felicities, that onely nature and reason should delight in? Do we eat or sleep better, because we are great and mighty? Or can all the passionate acquisitions of the earth, in honour and dignity, render us healthful if we be diseased, or make us fall back one year from our age, either to grant us more vigour or longer being? Will not the fast coming on of that allotted time by the divine powers, mingled with gray hairs and wrinkles, soon put a period to all those vapours of delight, which we rather imagine then possesse, though we should live to the uttermost date of all mortality? Of the contrary, the Gods onely know, by what accident we may be cut off, before that expectation can be performed, to an eternal forgetfulness perhaps, both of us and our actions. O sacred Truth, if not Religion, said he, let me here invoke your productions, to accompany hence forward all my intentions, with that power and assistance, may make me at leastwife to act temperately in what I go about: with these thoughts, though not settled determination, within a while he fell asleep, and so continued, until the chearful morning brought unto his chamber window the Sun, being the bright Governour of the day, that soon dispersed from his imagination, all those melancholly vapours of the night, that had set before his more recollected fancy, the lively representation of his own condition; insomuch as he not onely again flew from his pious thoughts, but was content to perswade at last his understanding, that as the business in it self was not of any wicked nature, in regard of the Interest of Crowns and Kingdomes (that seemed to claim Priviledges and Maximes, above all, Morality and Religion) so was it impossible for him, (since the Ambassadour of Lydia was himself departed from Memphis ) to frame any probable way for prevention, without endangering his Uncles honour; upon which, as he pretended, depended the whole welfare and absolute prosperity of Syria : These flatteries I may say, made him resolve to let the young Lovers to run their own hazard, rather then endanger such an inconveniency to fall upon his Family; so apt are men in worldly honours and happinesse, to entertain all unjust Chimera's, that tickle up those indulgent apprehensions, that onely correspond with sense and appetites. Thus again was he confirmed in his untoward faith, made up onely by his own desires, without any Counsel at all of vertue: so that with the same garb and greatness as he was accustomed, not onely went out of his chamber, attended by multitudes of flattering suitors, but according to the dissembling custome of that policy, which properly belongs to the actions of States-men, he saluted every person he met, with severall voluble complements, that were of force sufficient to have made them believe they had absolutely his heart in all their petitions, if experience had not taught them oftentimes the validity of favourites words; however they were to comply in countenances, as he did in language: which continued all things in a seeming calm in the Court of Orsames , until the two young Lovers Cloria and Narcissus , could be no longer perswaded to stay, by the alluring enticements, magnificencies, and pleasure of the same: wherefore, as a couple of gallant ships were provided for their transportation, (since for the honour of Syria it was not held convenient, one Vessel should contain both their persons, though the Lovers themselves were not well pleased with the Ceremony) so Orsames himself, would needs accompany them from Memphis to the sea-side: In the way they were met by divers petty Triumphs, from those Towns as they past down the River of Nilus ; which however protracted the time, longer then Cloria and Narcissus desired; not onely in regard of their own passionate desires to be in the Island of Cyprus , where they might have the oportunity, to prosecute the period of their wishes, according to the dictates of love and engagements; but for that they both knew also, their affectionate parents waited for their arrival, with a most violent zeal, having been a long time beforehand, by themselves advertised of their coming. So that after something a long and tedious journey, (because they so esteemed it) they arrived at the last Haven in Egypt ; where the fair and gallant prospect upon the sea, gave their eyes no bounds, but what the main Ocean was content to afford them; which proved delightful enough, in regard they had been so long a time shut up between other varieties. As this gave some period to their wishes, in embarquing suddenly for the Island of Cyprus ; so the chief Nobility of the Court appeared discontented at the resolution; for if the men honoured, and took a singular contentment in Narcissus noble vertues, his gallant presence being accompanied with youth and valour; so had the Ladies of Memphis no small delight and satisfaction, in Cloria's affable conversation, that had accompanied her in her journey; since she had not so much pride in her disposition, as to be either humorous or neglectful, although she never wanted a sufficient Majesty in her carriage, to make her self reverenced of all, according to the dignity of her person: to say the plain truth, she had a familiarity that perswaded love from the meanest, however she never failed to procure respect from the highest. And however, many crosses had rendred her thoughts inwardly something musing, nevertheless the greatnesse of her discretion, alwayes so tempered the prejudicial properties of it, that those inclinations of melancholly were never visible, but to her Governess Roxana , in her own private Cabinet, when they entred seriously into consideration of their fortunes; which a certain kinde of necessity sometimes seemed to exact from them both: if at all she appeared a little amazed at her frequent disasters, it was rather a mark of her extream innocency, then any courage she wanted to sustain her losses; as it were in a manner not believing, that it was possible for people to be so wicked, and the Gods still to continue entirely patient. These are the Attributes (if not much more) that all indifferent tongues and pens must give her. And the Syrians in the general, were loath to send away out of their own possession, such perfections into another Counntrey, which they esteemed far less worthy then their own; or rather, that she accompanied with those excellencies, should be lost from their society and expectation; which I must confesse, made her fair person aptly to be likened to a rich enamelled Case, all set over with Diamonds, and other precious stones; that notwithstanding within, contained a picture that was not to be valued by any estimation: onely some sympathy remained by a divine determination between the two Lovers; for as she was pleased by her very election, to parallel with her self Narcissus , so he could love no other ever, but excellent Cloria . In this posture, I say, when they came to the sea side, (in the interim the King leading Cloria by the hand) the sweet Princess, with a few beautiful tears in her fair eyes (being, at it were, loath to depart, though she desired nothing more then to be gone) fell down presently upon her knees, with a certain gentle intermixture of grief, made up between sorrow and bashfulness: which however it for some space hindred her expressions, yet at last she took her leave of her great Uncle, in these words: May all the Gods send you Sir, said she, both Victory in War, and Prosperity in Peace, until the very world grow old with your fame: but the King quickly stopt her imprecations, by two or three loving kisses, imprinted upon her fair lips; which kept in the other part of her discourse. Whilest Narcissus in another place, with a smiling countenance (as it were besieged by multitudes of embracements) dispatched his complements as fast as he could, since he imagined, they gave his thoughts scarce any thing but trouble and impediment, in that already all his wishes and desires were directed to another Region, which seemed more violently to carry his ambition, then the Southern windes, that attended at present to drive them out of the Haven: onely he appeared yet something unsatisfied, when he remembred that his Love was to be transported in one ship, and he in another, by the rigid rules of honour belonging to the Syrian Nation. When they had been conveighed (after all their complements) by many of the Nobility, into the gallant vessels, that lay some distance from the shore, the Trumpets of either side sounded their departure, as if they intended to summon the Gods to bestow a blessing upon the Voyage: when presently the sails being displayed, and the pendants and colours let flye to the best advantage, they lanched into the deep, where Neptune again seemed most willing to take their protection, since scarce a wave moved other then gently, to give them any manner of disturbance. Thus in a kinde of a certain supposed tranquility (by reason of the calm) they sailed for at least twelve hours, as it were playing with the windes, and contemplating the waters; and the more pleasant and satisfactory it was, in regard of the Seamens sometimes casting out their nets, to catch fish, for the delight of the Princess, and the rest of her Attendants. Whilest the company employed their thoughts with these entertainments, the Marriners began to fear a change of the weather; as well for that many Dolphins appeared oftentimes to shew themselves above the waves, (an indubitable signe esteemed of a storm) as also for that the winde of a sudden had altered its station a great deal more Eastward, which as they perceived, diverted their course from the Island of Cyprus , and carried them directly towards Crete: the other ship in the interim, where Narcissus was, seemed to be at some distance, having got the start of them, by reason of those sports the Marriners had presented to the Princess. Neither were their expectations long deceived, for presently they might observe, not onely certain black clouds to unite together suddenly in the East, but the windes began already to bluster, with something an open mouth. As this warned the Princess Cloria to retire into her own Cabinet, so the Marriners busily employed themselves, to put their ship in a posture against all accidents; being the more precipitate in their intention, for that it wanted not much above an hour to night. The storm encreasing, Cloria within a short time, not being able longer to brook the tossing and rolling of the seas, cast her self down upon her bed, to take off, as she imagined, the distempers and incommodities of her indisposition; in which posture notwithstanding, her fancy proved as well disturbed as her body, since both the cracks of thunder, with the uncouth whistling of the windes in the night season, became a great deal more unpleasant to her apprehension. However she was tied to those observances, until it should please the Gods, either to calm the seas, or put them in more security: But it should seem neither her prayers nor her companies wishes, were able at all to prevail with the divine powers, so farre as to make them in opinion confident of their own safeties. Untill at last it was necessary, not onely to take down all the chief Tacklings belonging to the ship, but also the main Mast it self: desiring they might rather commit their fortunes and preservation to the mercy of the seas, then any more rely upon the windes courtesie and gentleness, since they could not cast in their Anchors to any effect, by reason the water was so deep, and their Cables (as they knew) not strong enough to sustain the force of the Tempest; which seemed rather to increase in violence, then to give them hopes of abatement. In this danger and perplexity they continued many hours, the gallant Vessel all the while being tost from one billow to another, as if the Waves intended to shew to the heavens by their lofty motion, how much they disdained and scorned any controul; whilst the Ship notwithstanding with a brave kinde of fortitude, seemed still to contend against the rudeness of their malice; insomuch as (however being rather desperately wounded, then absolutely overcome) she made her way through the Seas with incredible celerity, in regard of the strength and highness of the winde, though she wanted both her Sails and Masts: but the Pilots not being able to inform themselves, which way she steered her course, by reason a thick mist, had overclouded the superficies of the water, were put again into new doubts, lest they might fall upon some Rocks to their ruine, though there was no remedy; for as all was to be left to the hazzard of the Seas, so their trust in supernatural mercies, was to be their chief comfort: notwithstanding this more then desperate danger, poor Cloria seemed in her inward thoughts, to be more solicitous for Narcissus safety, then for her own preservation; as it were invocating privately the pure heavens to that purpose, whilst the rest of the company sent out their prayers also to the Gods in their own behalfs. It was about noon the next day before the windes abated, when the Marriners informed the Master, they spied some land at a good distance, the skie having suddenly cleared much of its darkness; and not long after they might perceive many shallops upon the Seas belonging to poor Fishermen, casting their Nets into the Water. As this gave them all sufficient cause of joy and encouragement, so did they presently let out the long Boat that they had drawn into the Ship during the Storm, with intention to enquire of those people, not onely near what coast they remained, but how they might by their directions, provide in the best manner they could, for their conveniency of landing, whereby to repair their Vessel. It was not half an hours time, before the Boat again returned with this information, that as the land they were near was part of the Island of Crete , so not above half a dayes sail from that place, was the fair Haven Town of Pergame , whose Governour at present, was a great Nobleman of the Countrey named Dedalus ; that notwithstanding the Island was divided into many factions, by reason of the differences between Euarchus King of Lydia and his Senate, had kept that City wholly for the Kings interest: This news you may be sure, had put the Princess Cloria in such an extasie of joy, as would have created an entire felicity in her thoughts, if she had not in the interim, called again to her remembrance, her separation from Narcissus: but the company, rather flattering her opinion, then assuring their own thoughts, that undoubtedly he was past all hazzard, being in so good a Ship, she was quickly perswaded to go to Pergame , resolving there to remain, not onely whilst she heard some news of Narcissus ; but during a necessary conveniency might also be had, for the repairing of her own Ship, being as they told her absolutly uncapable (before she was mended) to make any other voyage whatsoever: she condescending to this councel and advice, some of the Fishermen were quickly hired with store of money, to be their guides and conductors to Pergame: So that presently tying a strong Cable to the great Vessel, and setting many Rowers in one of the biggest Shallops belonging to the Fishermen, they haled her along the Seas towards the Haven, as it were in a kinde of pleasant triumph; which they might the more commodiously do, for that now the winde being in a manner wholly allayed; they seemed to enjoy upon the water a sufficient calm for their purpose. But notwithstanding this commodity, it was almost the whole day, before they could draw their Ship, near a point of land that bordered upon the Haven; so that Cloria was forced for one night, to take up her lodging in a poor cottage: however, this gave her thoughts more satisfaction then the stately Vessel belonging to the Kingdom of Syria , had her body in the Storm. When the day came, as it was determined to continue their resolutions for the City of Pergame , so was it held convenient before the Princess approach, to give notice to the Governour, of her accidental arrival, within the dominion of his jurisdiction. This was quickly put in execution, by sending a messenger before, whilst they themselves within two hours space, were set ashore upon a promontory not many furlongs from the Town. The sweet Princess walked upon a green walk, pleasantly set with Trees, when Dedalus the Governour of Pergame , accompanied with many Gentlemen of the Countrey, and attended by one Troop of Horse, presented himself before her; not onely to give her reception into his Territories, but to undertake in the King her Fathers behalf (he being, as he said, his Deputy) all the entertainment that poor Kingdom (being lately much beaten with War) could afford. You may be sure Cloria was not backward to give him thanks, assuring him of her kinde acknowledgement of his endeavours. This conducted her to her company quickly (for the time was not proper for much complements) to take possession of a brave, though ancient Castle, seated upon a little rising at the further end of the Town, whilst the inhabitants in the interim, being placed in order of each side the Streets, gave the Princess a joyful welcome into that City, which her Father (as they said) had never visited: So being at last brought into her Chamber, with other ceremonies, it was not long before she went to bed, as well to rest her minde, as her body; however she first desired the Governour, to send out some small Ship of his own, then lying ready furnished in the Haven, to hearken out some tydings concerning the other Vessel of Syria . But however thus (by the goodness of the Gods) the sweet Princess had in a manner miraculously escaped the danger of the Seas, that seemed in some sort even ambitious of her ruine, coveting perhaps to have entombed so dainty a body within their uncouth intrals; yet could she not so soon shake off the malevolent effects of those distempers that had discomposed her during the tempest; which however they put her not in any danger of life, yet they did not onely keep her from being visited by any whatsoever, but for the most part continued her in her privatest Chamber for a long time, where onely Roxana and some few servants more attended upon her person. This gave the opportunity one day to Roxana (her Lady being asleep) to enquire of Dedalus , concerning the affairs of the Island; since, as she said, there could not chuse but be many things worth the knowing, in regard of Euarchus contention with the Senate, belonging to the jurisdiction thereof. Truly Madam, said he, as the passages have been lately many and strange, in this most unhappy Island of Crete , so to give you the better scantling of the businesses, that from time to time have hapned, I must in some sort begin with the original, when the Countrey first became under the Lydian power and jurisdiction. And to this purpose therefore you must know, that after the generation of the Gods had totally left Crete , to a certain kinde of wilde barbarisme, not onely in the manners of the people, but in the rudeness of the soil, for want of being industriously manured, some of the ancient Kings of Lydia conceiving, that the Island lay convenient for the jurisdiction of their own Crown, both by reason of the natural fertility of the ground, as in regard of the safety of the Harbours, began to create some ambition in their thoughts to be Lords of it; yet knowing, they could have no Title to the Countrey in their own Right, but what the Laws of the Sword might violently (if not injuriously) afford them, made earnest solicitation, to the great Arch-Flammin of Delphos , that in respect of the degenerating of the people, from all religious maximes, with the practice of other inhumane customs, (pretended to fall upon it for want of order and government) he would be pleased, under the sacred banner of his holy protection and power, to grant them the principality and jurisdiction of the Island; upon the condition nevertheless, that they should still be obliged, to observe those rites in their sacrifices to the Gods, as were onely used in the Temple of Delphos: With these titles and pretences, many of those Princes, taking alwayes advantage of the inhabitants factions and disagreement amongst themselves, sent several Armies either by force or policy, or both, to conquer the Countrey: which, to be short, within foure few years was totally effected, notwithstanding now and then many contradictions, and disturbances hapned, proceeding rather from the inconstant natures of the people, then that they had any great cause, to complain of their subjection to the Lydian Laws and Government. This gives me occasion a little to digress from the matter of the Story, with some explanation of the disposition of the ancient Natives; which in part perhaps hath caused so many changes, and revolutions in our Island. 'Tis true, they have bodies capable of such labour and activity, as might enrich the Countrey, if their mindes were answerable to their composure and making; but they are so extreamly lazy and proud by nature, that as they had rather beg or steal, then work, or take pains, so doth the soil wholly upon the matter lye unmanured; rather chusing in forreign parts any servile office whatsoever, then they will make the best of their own Livings and Estates, at home in their own Countrey: whilst their Wives and Families also in the interim are content to seek out new and strange fortunes, with whose troops of attendants, not ommitting nevertheless the least part of those ceremonies, that belong to persons of the greatest quality, although every night they lye in Barns, and in the day feed scarce upon any thing that can afford nourishment to their appetites. The women may be said to be rather chaste by nature, then that they can give any reason in their own thoughts, why they are honest at all; for that commonly they sleep altogether, without any distaste in the general, or the least shew of jealousie in the particular; a laudable property, incident to most barbarous Nations: however perhaps meerly proceeding, from want of luxurious inticements, that use to enflame lusts in dispositions. The men are valiant enough in the Wars of other Countries; but whether by constraint or nature I will not say, since at home it is most apparent, they even want courages to defend their Wives and Children, rather trusting to their own craft and subtilty in circumventing their enemies, then any way desiring with their Swords in their hands to oppose; perhaps thinking it a folly, where they any way can get advantage to complement about honour; for no people in the world hate with a more unrelenting spight, or revenge by a more hidden cruelty. When they go to the Wars, whole Troops and Families follow, to accompany their friends, out of kindness, though their intentions for the most part are thereby to pillage Camps of either side according to the fortune of the day. Concerning their Religion, though they do exactly adhere to the ancient rules of Delphos , and that with a seeming zeal outwardly, yet seldom or never perform they those rites, with an intention to observe any morality; insomuch as it may be said, they rather use such ceremonies, because they will not change customs, then that they hope to receive absolute benefit by them; in this manner being content to suffer themselves to be flattered, onely with an opinion they do well, when they will not take any care at all to be better satisfied. In conclusion, they love to talk of Lands and Possessions, withheld injuriously from their right, but never attempt any means probable to come to them again. And this, Lady, being as near as I can guess, the truest Character of our common People, I shall again return to the prosecution of our story. As I said before, after the Kings of Lydia by many deseats given to some of the principal of the Nobility, that esteemed themselves Princes in Authority and command, if not in Titles and Right, had settled an absolute Monarchy in the Island, by degrees, the people were brought into a kinde of slavish condition, since they conceived, they were fitter to be made obey then to command; not onely in regard of their lack of knowledge, and constancy in the general, but also for that the Governours perceived, that however they wanted sufficient industry to mannage the Councels, as well as their Laws in their own Countrey, yet they had spight enough against the jurisdiction of strangers: It was sufficient they did not affect other Nations, and therefore could not love the Lydians , insomuch as notwithstanding the apparent benefit they found, by practising and using the Lydian customs, in many things concerning the sowing of Corn and the like, they rather chose to undergo the penalty, for their not putting them in execution, then they would in any kinde subject themselves, to those laudable and profitable observations; as if their pride appeared sufficiently satisfied, in not seeming willing to follow that which certainly was the best, for no reason but that it was prescribed them; however I must say the Noblemen in the general, were not onely for the most part very much civilized, but extreamly affected to the Crown of Lydia , as knowing from thence were brought learning, riches, and education: though some great persons amongst them notwithstanding, rather endeavoured to head many barbarous factions (out of I cannot tell what manner of sordid ambition) then they would either come to Court themselves, or seem to hold any friendly correspondency with any of those that did, though they were of the same Blood and Kindred with themselves; which not onely raised many jealousies amongst the Nobility in the particular, but alwayes caused a great Court suspicion, concerning the affections of the Nation in the general; so that those that for the most part, attended upon the Person of the Kings in Lydia , notwithstanding their continual industry, to do their Princes service, were looked upon with no eyes of favour and grace, by reason of this unpolished ambition of those Lords, that still addicted themselves to the old Cretan manners; as it were loving it for no other cause, but that it seemed to thwart and contradict the Lydian customs: This pride indiscreetly executed, at the first I say, treated jealousies in our Princes, which again returned hatred to us; wherefore, as the wisdom of councellours, thinking to provide against rebellions, would never make choise of any of the natives for governours; so the natives thinking themselves dishonoured thereby, were unwilling to obey such Commanders set over them: Upon this followed complaints on all sides; and many of our Lords, not daring to dispute the right of their justifications in Lydia , oftentimes forbore to appear upon summons, so that advantages being made of their fear, rather then knowledge of their crimes, their Estates became confiscated for their omission, which of necessity enflamed their hearts to thoughts of more disloyalty, until at last their spleen (joyning with the humours of the people, who had not much to lose because they would possess but little) made them at last fall into an open Rebellion, which for some years filled our Countrey with blood and slaughters. But now Madam, said he, as I have but hitherunto presented you with a glass, whereby you may the better understand the story I am to tell, so shall I in as brief a way as I can, repeat unto you not onely the occasions as I conceive of the late Tragedies, acted in this poor and unfortunate Island, but also make you acquainted with the very realities themselves: To this purpose I must say in the Reign of a late Queen of Lydia , a woman endowed with admirable gifts of nature, as also had a spirit answerable thereunto, (whereby she seemed to give her undertaking countenance) that Nation fell out both with the Arch- Flammin of Delphos and the great King of Egypt at the same time: The first she pretended usurped an unjust Authority over her Subjects and Dominion, as the other she alledged too ambitiously endeavoured an universal Monarchy over all Princes. These differences likely to go into some desperation, between these mighty persons and the Queen, gave causes sufficient of admiration to all these parts of Asia ; and the rather for that as they could not well comprehend, how such a masculine courage could be in a woman; so did they as little know, in what manner she would defend these extraordinary breaches: but experience quickly made them see, she not onely intended, but prosecuted her intentions with all vigour: for as she absolutely abolished within a short space, all the jurisdiction of Delphos out of her Kingdoms, so did she within a while after, give the King of Egypt such overthrows by Sea, that scarce could be in many years recover his losses. In the interim, whilest these contentions were acting, with no small violence of all sides, to the contentment (if not amazement) of many other Princes, that esteemed the differences a kinde of safety to themselves. The unwise Island of Crete , believing they might again recover, either all or some part of their lost Priviledges, (pretending they were obstructed in their Religion) not long after entred into open rebellion. To tell you, that the main motives of their risings, proceeded from the instigations of Egypt and Delphos , is not an improbable conjecture; since as the one in a ceremonious assembly of Flamins, declared the Queen an accursed enemy to his Rites and Jurisdiction, so did the other send Forces into Crete , to strengthen the people in their pretensions; which however these assistances seemed not to prevail entirely against the Queens Governours in the Island, yet apparently they procured her Officers so many disturbances from time to time, that however she neither failed them with supplies, or was wanting to them in counsels, yet for many years together, the Rebels kept a considerable Body in the Field, in despight of all the Queens Forces. In this manner these contentions continued many years; for as the Queen seemed with Majestick Spleen, to be enflamed with her Subjects Disobedience, so were her Subjects in their rage animated by Messengers sent from Delphos , to put them alwayes in minde of their Religious Obligations: Whereunto being added their hate to the Lydian Government, and the confidence they had of Egypts assistance, they seemed oftentimes to have received a new spirit of valour, contrary to their nature and custom; however for the most part, they rather made use of their subtilty, in sending out small parties to circumvent and entrap the Enemy, then being willing at any time to hazzard in the Field a main Battle, to decide the controversie; which was the reason the War was so long prolonged, with several successes of either side: for as the Cretans had the advantage, of perfectly knowing the Countrey, amongst Woods and Bogs, so had the Lydians a great deal the better in their conduct and resolution: but which way soever businesses went, as the Rebels were conducted by a Nobleman of the Nation, whose Family and Name was as great amongst the people, as his Spleen and Courage was against the Queen, so became the State of Lydia exceeding weary of the War, being most certain, the money disbursed in the contention, would never by any conquest she could make of the Island, be again repayed into her Coffers: Wherefore, after some deliberation it was resolved, to send over a principal Favourite of the Queens, whereby to put the sooner an end by his Authority and Fidelity, to those chargeable and bloody differences, that not onely destroyed her people in the Island of Crete , but disquieted her own Government in the Kingdome of Lydia: and the rather was it so determined, for that she had been perswaded, that the Souldiers of her Army in this Island, lengthened the War on purpose, for their own benefit and command: knowing when that should be once absolutely finished, their esteem at Court, would fall with their want of imployment in the Field: But contrary to her expectation, this Favourite of hers having more ambition then foresight, (since he was sent away onely by his enemies, to separate him from the Queens Person) as also being more vain-glorious in his thoughts, then experienced in his years, (and so consequently not having much knowledge either of the Countrey, or the Enemy) after a most vast expence of money, and nothing in a manner acted against the Rebels, he returned again into Lydia , with disgrace and dishonour; which at last by reason of his subtil adversaries practices, that undermined him in the Queens favour, he lost his head upon a Scaffold, by the common Executioner; in whose place notwithstanding such a brave personage was sent, that in a very short space, reduced the Rebels to so much necessary reason, both in their Persons and Estates, that they offered quietly to submit to mercy, without either condition or contention. This being entertained, and the people ready in all places to lay down Arms, the Queen her self suddenly changes her own habitation here, for a more lasting one in another world; that made all things at a stand for a time. But as Euarchus Father met with no opposition, in that possession that belonged unto him with so much justice, so upon his first entrance into Lydia , he was presented with an absolute submission, not onely of the great Noblemen of our Island, that had for many years contended with the Queen, but also of all his Party, that were neither few in number, or penurious in fortunes. Nevertheless, although this King was merciful enough in his disposition, as well to pardon all faults, as to forget former disaffections; yet the hungry Myssians his natural Countreymen, perceiving that the forfeitures of the Island of Crete , by reason of the late rebellions, were not of value, to be returned back again to the owners, without some profits made thereby; and finding the scituation and fertility of the Countrey able to make full reparation to their greedy stomachs for the defects and sterility of their own habitations, not onely perswaded the King, that his act of mercy would prove of dangerous consequence to rebellious dispositions hereafter, but obtained at his hands, so many grants of possession in this Island, that gave them sufficient conveniency and authority, to transport a great part of their own people hither; where being established after a while with peace and security, by their industry joyned together with their power, they soon outed most of the inhabitants of their Estates; and at last took from all in general both their Liberty and Religion; insomuch as many ancient Families were either turned a begging in their own Countrey, or forced to seek servile offices in other parts for subsistance. This, I must say, is the common allegation of the natives, and in part true, although I must confess much of their miseries proceeded from their lazy dispositions (as I have formerly said) that would not permit them to equal other Nations in painful endeavour; rather chusing in their natures to be wanderers, then become willing to submit their persons under the jurisdiction of better customs. But be it what it will, in this condition they remained without any power at all to act, until the beginning of these differences, between our King Euarchus , and his great Senate; when the people, (not having altogether forgot their old hate to the Lydians , and now finding some opportunity to expresse it) began anew to flye out, however the particular causes were these: When the Myssians first proclaimed their dislike, by leading Armies to oppose Kingly Authority in their own Nation, one Polinex , once Governour of this Island (though since destroyed for his Service) prepared a company of expert Souldiers, to be imployed against the Myssians , as esteeming them most proper to the purpose, in regard of their hate to those people. But not to detain you over long by needless repetitions, and circumstances of things which are onely conjectural: After that our King Euarchus , in a manner had committed the mannagement of affairs into the hands of his great Senate of Lydia , it was not held either needful by way of opposition, or convenient by reason of the expence, to continue afoot those Souldiers, that had been leavied and provided by Polinex , in this Island of Crete ; wherefore orders were presently sent to disband the Troops; but in some sort nevertheless to give them satisfaction, lest they might prove dangerous and troublesome to the Government, they gave them what liberty they pleased, to contract with other Princes, for their future entertainment in some forreign Wars. However the Myssians , when they perceived the Souldiers were thus by bargain to be transported; either fearing their return in a Body to their prejudice, or rather (I may say) envying all felicity of theirs, made earnest suit to the Senate of Lydia , (with whom then they held a most intimate correspondency) not to suffer them to go out of the Kingdome. As these perswasions prevailed, before the consideration of the contract made for their transportation, so the people of this Island, being not onely inflamed with these injurious proceedings, as they esteemed them, but also fearing an utter extirpation of the whole Nation, by reason of the malice and practices of the Myssians , of a sudden (having entred before into many consultations amongst themselves) began as well to make use of those Arms they were already provided of, as to seize into their hands many strong Towns in the Countrey; however in the interim, they set forth many Proclamations in their own defence; which in effect were to this purpose, that in regard the King himself had in a manner lost all his own prerogative, whereby he was formerly impowred to govern, they in their own behalfs now were necessitated to take up Arms for their preservation, both against Myssia and the Kingdom of Lydia ; that sought not onely the abolishing of their Religion, but an extirpation of their persons: but however these pretensions were plausible enough, and perhaps no otherwise meant by them at the first, yet the ontrageous violence commited of both sides, soon drew many Commanders of Crete from other parts, who instead of contributing their endeavours in making onely a defensive War, they violently perswaded the people to stand upon their own pretended priviledges before the conquest; as having either Kings of their proper Nation, or at leastwise no strangers to command over them; whilst they themselves also began to challenge old Dignities and Titles, with the possession of most of the Lands in the Conntrey, that for many years had belonged to other persons and families, that perhaps had bought them to them and their heirs, at most valuable and considerable rates. This in a very short space set the whole Island in such a burning and outrageous flame, that slaughters of such execrable natures were committed, (to the very horrour, as I may say of mankinde) that both my self, and some other Noblemen of the Countrey, were forced to take up Arms, not onely for the defence of our persons, and estates, but to bring the people of both sides to a better temper: for my own part, as I used what moderation I could in executions upon my Countreymen, at what time soever I gained any Victories over them (which truly was not very seldom) so by this means their hatred began to be augmented towards me as against a Myssian enemy: insomuch as they began to form orderly Councels of their part, as we did entertain with regularity those supplies were sent us out of Lydia ; for however they had the greatest part of the Countrey at their dispose, yet we held the most commodious for our purpose; things thus resting in doubtful though bloody conflicts, until the differences between our King Euarchus , and the Senate now remaining at Sardis , began to take up new considerations, in the thoughts and appetites of all sorts of people, that had any relation to the Lydian Government; wherefore the King having drawn armies into the Field for his own pretended defence, as the Senate had raised Forces to contend against his intentions, the Souldiers under my command, being more desirous to serve in the Lydian Wars, where gain and honour were (as they thought to be obtained) then to remain here without either pay or benefit, both they and my self in a particular way, endeavoured to serve the King against his Senate; and of a sudden, shuffling up a truce with the Rebels in these parts, upon their faithful promises, not onely to submit to their Princes pleasure, upon reasonable conditions, but further to assist him in his present Wars, both with their Persons and Estates; I sent all the Souldiers presently to the Kings Armies, keeping in the interim this Town, with some other under my jurisdiction, to be disposed of as he shall at any time appoint. In fine, as this is as short a relation as I can make of those accidents, that have befallen our unhappy Countrey, from the beginning of the Lydian rule, so cannot I but esteem my self extreamly satisfied for the present, that although it hath not yet come within the compass of my ability, to do the King any remarkable or profitable services, that the Princess Cloria is not onely her self in person, come under the power of that command I hold under her Father, but that her distresses and necessities at Sea also, have been in part relieved by the natural scituation of this Island of Crete , which as a good and lucky Omen , will preserve it hence forward (I hope) from destruction, if not grant it a better blessing, then lately it hath received from the favour of the Heavens: and with these words accompanied by such a look, that was capable enough to win belief, concerning his affectionate endeavours to the King, he ended his discourse. Roxana after she had returned the Governour thanks, with two or three sighs to express in a sort her inward sorrow for the accidents, as it were both pittying the people, and doubting the event, (since as Dedalus himself seemed not over-confident of his power, so had she heard of many factions in the Island) she desired him, that he would be yet pleased, to augment so far her obligation, as in a few more words, added to his further trouble, to let her know, how the common interest at present stood in the Countrey, as well in regard of the King, as the Senate; for that himself appeared not to have (as she said) an absolute command through the whole Island. Dedalus soon replyed, that as he could not much brag of the affections of the inhabitants concerning his own particular person, (not onely in regard he had given them, as he said, many desperate overthrows in their late contentions; but for that he was not of the same opinions with them in the Worship of the Gods; upon the which they seemed to ground their chief dislikes against both King and Senate) so could he easily resolve her, that the Countrey in the general was divided into three factions: The first being for the King intirely, the second enclined to the ancient natives, and the third was wholly addicted to the Senates interest; but whether in the end will prevail (said he) the Gods onely can inform: since, however the first seems to have the best right, yet the two remaining exceed in power and probability: the one being better furnished with Money and Provisions, as the others are accompanied with Numbers and Violence. As he was about to proceed in his discourse, they were both advertised of the return of those Messengers, that had been sent to enquire after the safety of the other Ship wherein Narcissus was; who being presently called into their presence, one of them gave this short account of their Voyage by Sea: Having for many dayes, said he, not onely coasted several Islands belonging to Greece , but much also of the continent appertaining to the lesser Asia , we could have no news at all of any such Vessel, either Shipwrackt, or put into Harbour; until at last by chance we met with a Merchant of Rhodes , going for Carthage , who informed us, that for certain before his departure from that City, a gallant Ship both with Syrian and Egyptian Colours, was arrived in the chief Haven belonging to the Island, however much beaten and torn with the Weather: but what people or commodities were contained in her, he said he could not inform us, in respect he himself was under sail upon his departure, when that Ship came in. The Messenger also added further, that a great Fleet of Lydian Vessels, that were newly come upon the Seas, lay between Rhodes and Cyprus , which hindred them for the present, for making any further enquiry or experiment, since if they should have approached the Island, as he said, it had been almost impossible to have escaped, by reason they could not but have easily been discovered to be of King Euarchus party: It is not to be doubted, but as this intelligence sufficiently satisfied them, concerning the safety of the other Ship; so did they haste to the Princess Chamber with the Messengers, to give her information of the expedition, which for the present hindred the period of Dedalus relation, concerning the passages of the Island, according to his intention. Of the Princess CLORIA. concerning the safety of Narcissus , in regard of the Messengers relation, so Roxana with more alacrity and chearfulnesse, summoned anew Dedalus , to make an end of those passages belonging to the Island of Crete ; whereupon one day meeting in the same walk that had entertained the Princesse, upon her first arrival in the Countrey, they both seated themselves together under a Tree, artificially made into an Arbour of pleasure, that had its full prospect toward the sea, whilest he gave her this further account. Madam, said he, as for the Interests which I formerly mentioned unto you not many dayes since you may be pleased to know, that as Euarchus our King in his Wars with the Senate of Lydia , must be forced upon all occasions, to court any assistance whatsoever for his best advantage; so of the other side do the Cretans resolve to make use of their present power, to gain benefits to themselves, and party in any thing they can procure, either from their Prince or any other: To this purpose, after the agreement that I told you of, which I made with the Natives of the Countrey, (however many of the most rigid sort, would not at all come within any manner of communication, whereby to be subject to the Lydian power, thereunto encouraged as 'tis supposed by a messenger from Delphos , that neither understands the Islands Interest, or the peoples good) they designed Commissioners to be sent to Philadelpha , where the King then remained, to treat upon such conditions, as they conceived most necessary for their commodity and security: Thus arriving at Court, in a short time they were not onely admitted to kiss the Kings hands, but withall permitted to present their Petitions and Requests; for this ceremony, (and so I may well call it, since it produced but small effects, to the advantage of any party) there was appointed a great Hall in the City of Philadelpha , into which place the messengers were brought with some state; as soon as the King was seated in his Throne, because they should not complain of the want of any circumstance, that belonged to the solemn entertainment of Ambassadours of other Nations, to make them the willinger to comply towards the assistance desired: After they had been in this manner received, as also with good language from the Kings own mouth cherished, they presented a paper that contained these peremptory demands. First, they desired to have, not onely the free exercise of their Religion through the whole Island, notwithstanding the Lydian Laws to the contrary, according to the Rites and Customs of Delphos ; but withal to enjoy the use of the best Temples, alone appropriated to themselves, with all the Rents and Priviledges that of old at any time belonged unto them. Secondly, they expected an absolute concession from his Majesty, that no Governours whatsoever of any Forreign Nation should be appointed over them in Crete , or in any Fort or Island belonging to the same; besides they refused to admit of those of the very Countrey it self, unless they were confirmed and approved of by the general Councel, which they had established to mannage and ordered all their affairs, both in peace and war: And lastly, they expected (as the writing which they had delivered the King exprest) an absolute restoration of all those Lands to the true owners, that had been taken from their possession, by reason of any former pretended Rebellion, and given to the Missians or Lydians , either by the old Queen of Lydia , or Euarchus Father. The King, as I was informed, after he had read these Propositions, seemed to the outward view of the assembly, extreamly troubled in his apprehensions, as if he had been exceedingly deceived in his expectation, concerning the good nature and reality of our Countreymen: notwithstanding he was by this means, sufficiently enflamed in his thoughts, in regard of these proceedings; (not onely in some sort disdaining to be thus handled by his Subjects in his necessities, but being also with some reason suspitious of their intentions, as fearing that they aimed to become Masters of the whole Island, and so by consequence to be possessors of most of the Lands of his best friends, who were actually employed now with him in his Wars) yet conceiving that he was not at the instant, in a capacity to shew much discontent to any party, that could either good or hurt him in his present differences with the Senate, he gave their Commissioners at leastwise fair words in the general, promising speedily to send particular messengers of his own into Crete , not onely more knowingly to treat with them concerning their demands; but withal, if it were possible, to conclude with them concerning his own desires, which he conceived would be for both their advantages, against the common enemy that had an intention to destroy both: in this manner they were dismist into their own Countrey, partly pleased, and a great deal more unsatisfied, in regard no more life remained from their employment, then the expectation of the comming of the Kings Officers: But in the interim, whilest these messengers were lookt for, both the Kingdom of Syria , and the Countrey of Æ gypt put in for their several interests, as well concerning the Government it self of the Island, as to be supplied from hence, with Souldiers in their Wars, one against another; the State of Syria went onely upon the score of Euarchus Right and Titles, though Sorastros challenged their affections in his service, by an ancient tye, as he said, they owed the Egyptian Nation: neither, as I told you formerly, was the Arch-Flamin of Delphos backward, in maintaining to the uttermost of his power (by the industry of some instruments he employed) his own jurisdiction above either; as pretending the best right to the same, by reason of those agreements that had been made with the Kings of Lydia , who first conquered this Island. These attempts I must say, extreamly divided the Inhabitants both in their actions and opinions; for as the more moderate sort of people (especially those that had any correspondency with the Lydians , either by extraction or commerce) were willing enough to continue the old Government, and retain both their Laws and Customs they had formerly used; so the violenter part of the Natives, that had time out of minde contracted a certain kinde of barbarisme in their manners and dispositions, would hear of no agreement, but what was prescribed them by a few Commanders, that were sent from the Egyptian Wars, who seemed onely to comply with the Religion of Delphos for their own ends: The people I may affirm with some confidence, were so far transported, and infatuated with this spightful ambition, (their Governours in the interim, supposing they should be made petty Princes in command, amongst the more ignorant sort of Natives) that they did not onely decline violently all manner of reasonable accords, but even were perswaded to hate with an exact spleen and malice, all their own Countreymen, Friends, and Kindred, that had any manner of correspondency, or almost the least communication with those of the Lydian Race and Interest: in the interim the Senate of Lydia , finding this violence and distractions amongst us, resolved to put many of the strong Forts of the Countrey, (which from the beginning of the troubles, they had kept in their possession) absolutely into the hands of the Missians , the better to avoid the expence, and inconveniency of the War in their own particulars, having as they thought enough to do with their King in Lydia ; and the rather for that they knew, that as Myssia was most proper; to send Souldiers of their own Nation into the Island of Crete , whereby to contend with the Inhabitants, so was there such an inveterate spleen and hatred between the Natives of both Countreys, not onely in regard of their possessions, but their Religion, that no reconciliation was at any time to be feared: besides the Myssians , with others of Lydia of their faction and interests, supposed the old Cretans owed them a secret revenge, for having injuriously outed them of their Lands and Estates, in the time of the late King Euarchus Father. These Transactions, I say, filled the whole Countrey anew with blood and slaughters; and the more confused it proved, (and so consequently the more horrid) in regard that for the most part, we fought dividedly upon a general score of three Interests: sometimes two against one, and then again each for it self, as often as any opposition was found, which not seldom happened, in regard of the many jealousies and suspitions, rising daily out of the variety of apprehensions, by reason of frequent accidents: so that in a short time, almost in every place the Towns were fired, the people destroyed, and the Countrey depopulated; being no safety in any place, or scarce the least means of subsistance out of Armies, unless it were under the walls, and protection of some few Garrisons, that secured a kinde of small circuit, for necessary provisions, to maintain themselves and the Inhabitants of their Jurisdiction: But the King at last receiving from me and others intelligence of these lamentable proceedings in the Island of Crete, (as truly in a manner it was past all examples, since the intention of all sides was not alone to contend about disputable rights, occasioned by some former oppression, but even to extirpate not onely whole families, but the very remembrance of the Nation it self, that should have the unhappiness to be overcome by the other) gave order to me if it were possible to reconcile these bloody differences and horrid contentions, with all the speed I could, especially amongst those of his own party; neither was he determined to exclude out of this number the old Cretans themselves, however depending upon other interests, onely in regard they seemed by their Declarations formerly in words, to stand for his Title and Authority, against the proceedings of the Myssians , though publickly they contended violently with his Forces in the field. 'Tis true I cannot deny, but in some things they had reason enough for their jealousies, the King very often being constrained, to go even from his own resolutions, to give satisfaction to those Councels, that were continually about his person; who perswaded him he lost the love of his people in Lydia , by seeming in any kinde to favour or countenance the Cretans in their demands, who as they pretended were enemies to their general established Religion; Of the other side, the Natives were again by much too covetous and mistrustful, not onely to desire violently other mens possessions and estates from them, but so entirely to doubt the Kings performance of his promises, when as they knew he did but endeavour for his better advantage, to contract privately with them in most particulars, in such matters as appertained to the Temple of Delphos , for giving, as I said, too general a distaste, to those of his own party, within the Kingdom of Lydia . But to be short, it was not very long, before the King sent a most intimate Councellor of his own into the Island of Crete , as well to inform me particularly of his pleasure by word of mouth, as also to joyn himself with me and others in Commission, for the better and speedier effecting of his designs: presently as soon as he arrived, we sent out our Summons to the whole Countrey in the general, either to meet themselves, or to appoint Deputies for each Division in the Island, to attend the Kings orders and direction, upon a certain day at Pergame ; not onely to hear what should be propounded in their Princes behalf, for their future peace and advantage, but also we our selves would be ready to hear what the people would demand, to their further satisfaction, whereby their enemies the Myssians , might be opposed in their intentions; who endeavoured not onely to beat down all Kingly Authority in the Island, but to become absolute Lords over all the Inhabitants ancient Liberties: I must tell you, whilst we expected a joyful issue of these purposes, we understood another great Lord of Lydia , was newly arrived with certain directions as was pretended from the King, independent to that power was granted us, whereby as we were informed, onely himself was impowred underhand, to deal more intimately with the inhabitants concerning matters of Religion: as this something startled our expectation, having no such notice from the King, so did we resolve to send for the party upon our authority, who upon his appearing neither obeying our commands, nor giving us the satisfaction was desired, we at that very instant, restrained his person, until the Kings pleasure in that particular (as we said) should be publickly known: but whether these proceedings of ours, (which however we esteemed for the best) or that the Natives in truth were otherwise settled in their resolutions hindred the success, when the day came according to the appointment for this Assembly to meet, there appeared none at all of the ancient Inhabitants of the Countrey; so that upon some conclusion of a few things between us and the rest of the Cretans , who were not altogether so spiteful against the Lydian Customs as the others, we for the present dissolved any further Treaty, which in a manner is as much as I can say of our present state and affairs, until I shall be better instructed, either by the Natives inclinations, or concerning the Kings fortunes and success; it not being yet a moneth since the intended Treaty was broke up. Roxana as she had been very attentive to all Dedalus discourse, for that she was extreamly desirous to inform her self in what particulars she could, concerning the passages of the Island; so when he had absolutely made an end of what he would say, she used these words unto him, Truly, my Lord, said she, I must needs confess, this seems to my imagination to be a most unfortunate Countrey in the general, if not to be threatned by some desperate fate from the Heavens, to its destruction: however of the other side, it seems something doubtful as yet to my apprehension, in what things the Natives are so much to blame according to many mens thoughts, since it is but reasonable, as the King is to expect from them their fidelity and assistance, so they should in some sort, be assured in their Religion and Possessions, especially in a conjuncture of times, when there are so many enemies of all parts, that conspire their ruine; not onely in respect of the Myssians , that are in open hostility against them, but in regard also of those that attend about Euarchus person at the Court; who are no way inclinable, as you have already intimated, to favour their proceedings or interest, Truly Madam, answered Dedalus , if there were no more in it then those generals you mention, there might be much said in their behalfs; but being pleased to admit so far of a tedious discourse, that I may a little take apart the particulars of their demands, I make no question but you will easily perceive, that as they were unreasonable, to exact from the Kings necessicessities such conditions, so was it impossible for him to grant them their desires, without endangering in a manner the whole frame of his affairs, both in Lydia and Crete it self. Dedalus finding, that Roxana was most willing to hear all his arguments for her better satisfaction, he began thus to dispute: First, said he, for their propositions mentioned, not onely to have a free liberty to exercise their own Countrey Rites, in the worship of the Gods, according to the use of Delphos , but to have most of the chief Temples, belonging to the Island delivered into their hands, with all the Rents and Revenues belonging unto them, it cannot but evidently appeare, to all knowing judgements, what a distraction it would soon have made in Crete , when as in many places most of the inhabitants themselves, are contrary in their opinions to those principles, whereupon would follow a most desperate confusion amongst all sorts of people; when such should be of a sudden, debarred of the usual place of their sacrificing to the Gods, by those that formerly were subject to their Laws and Customs; and much more strange and distasteful it would be, to have the maintenance of all their Priests and Flamins (being for the most part Lydians by birth) taken from them, and they turned with their whole Families into the world without any substance at all, after so long a time of possession and settlement: besides it is very well known, many of the Noblemen and Gentry of the Countrey it self, upon whose fidelity and power the Kings present affairs depended, were actually vested in a great part of those Titles and Rents (in a manner beyond any remembrance) either by gift or purchase: who no doubt upon such a disadvantageable change, meerly out of spleen and distaste, would have quickly turned their endeavours and affections, to the countenancing absolutely of the Myssians proceedings against Euarchus their Prince: In the next place whereas they demanded, that either no strange Governours should be appointed over any part of the Island, but meerly Natives, or at leastwise such as should be approved by the general Councel instituted by themselves, I pray consider but with indifference (which I know you do) what an extraordinary, (and I may say) a most preposterous inconveniency, it would have brought upon the Kings designs, not onely by reason of those contemptible opinions, it would have created in all mens mindes, concerning his actions and want of spirit, but also have given so general a distaste to all his Subjects of best quality in both Kingdoms, that the effects must needs have been of a most dangerous consequence, when as the principal men of honour should be absolutely outed, both of their present command, or future expectation, to give way to the advancement of such people, that neither knew well how to govern when they should be employed, or the King himself could be at all certain of their fidelity, when they were in office; as well in regard of the fantastical inconstancies of their own natures and dispositions, as also in respect of their several interests depending upon other Nations. And last of all, whereas it is desired, that all those Lands be again restored to the ancient Natives of the Island, which had been at any time forfeited, for what pretended Rebellion soever, either in the Reign of the Father of Euarchus , or the old Queen of Lydia , and so consequently in the possession of any Lydians or Myssians , would have proved as dangerous an inconveniency to the Kings affairs, as any other thing we have yet mentioned; and in truth would have been a work (besides the general distaste) of a most stupendious labour to have effected; not onely in regard of the several intricate Titles, that must of necessity depend upon the long continuation of them from one family to another, by reason of alienations and bargains of divers natures and manners, made between man and man, but also would be a most difficult matter for the Natives themselves, justly to distribute with an indifferent equality and content, to each party who should make their demands; since as many would pretend to what was none of their own, so others again being but very young, (if at all then born) when their ancestors lost the possession of their estates, (the property of them being also since that time changed, either by cutting down of woods, erecting of building, or peopling of towns and villages) would be defrauded of their dues, for want of certain knowledge, what belonged to their parents: besides how many hundred of families, would be turned to a most miserable begging posture? who as Tenants to their Lords, had laid out their money of a considerable value upon purchases, either for lives or years, and knew not where to seek other habitations with their wives and children for their subsistance; neither truly could the Natives make any considerable profit of the said Lands, for want of people to manure them, since it is very well known, they in their own persons are not any way husband-men, or at all industrious without the Lydian assiance; wherefore consequently, this course and alteration must bring a general devastation upon the whole Countrey: but put case some would readily yield to these orders and injunctions, by reasons of quietness and possession, yet no doubt but the most part would oppose, being by birth or extraction either Myssians or Lydians , which of necessity would procure confusion enough, as also be a means that Euarchus enemies, would disposses all his friends under their Jurisdiction in like manner, wheresoever they had gained by their swords any thing over the Kings fortunes in Lydia, Myssia , or Crete . Of the other side, if we do but consider the small aid and assistance, these people could have afforded their Prince at the best, we shall finde these concessions (upon the matter) would have been wholly lost, since they undertook onely, to procure him ten thousand men to be employed in his Wars, without paying them for any considerable time; and the Gods know perhaps, they would not fully have performed those promises, being as uncertain in their undertakings, as unreasonable in their demands: No, no, Madam, said he, these were but meer Chymera's, broached by some of their eminent commanders for their own ends, to render themselves great and potent amongst the people, and afterward would have made use of their power, as their Ancestors did before them, to no other purpose but to exercise Tyranny, and nourish Rebellion: And however I say, that the messenger sent from Delphos seemed to concurre in these designs, though I will not say he erred, so much in will and intention, as out of ignorance and want of judgement: nevertheless though he imagined onely perhaps to reduce the Inhabitants to their ancient obedience to the Temple of Delphos , without prejudicing much others rights, yet his complying so much with their rude and barbarous customs in outward shew, according to the old Natives humours; with his publickly discountenancing all others of a more civill conversation, notwithstanding they professed the same Religion and Worship of the Gods, gave not onely cause of too much suspition, concerning his designs and purposes, but occasioned a great deal of confusion and distraction in the generall, as well to the overthrow of the Kings Interest, as to the hazard of the Natives subsistance in their own Countrey, in regard of the advantages their enemies the Myssians make of their differences. But here a messenger sent from the Princesse Cloria stopt their further discourse, who as he said desired to speak with Roxana ; so that the old woman, onely thanking Dedalus for what was past, and promising to meet him often upon the same subject, made haste to know her Mistresses pleasure. When Roxana came into her Chamber, the Princess told her, that she had been lately troubled with a most untoward and fearful dream, which (however in her thoughts she was not at all superstitious (as she said) yet she could not absolutely free her apprehension from the consideration of it: she imagined her self and Narcissus to be upon the Sea together in one Vessel, when of a sudden an extream darkness seemed to cover the face of the water, insomuch as they could not perceive any thing at all about them; whereupon both of them remaining frighted, with a kinde of horrour to see so great an unexpected change in the weather, from a clear sunshine day, to a time almost as black as night, they might at last behold themselves encompassed round about with many ships, belonging to the Senate of Lydia , that bid them presently yield to that power without resistance, unless they would hazard their own destructions: so that instantly conceiving themselves no way able to resist so peremptory a command, their persons were presently not onely seized, but separated with a great deal of cruelty one from another, to their no small grief and amazement; whilst in the interim also she heard some of the company say, that as this design was put in execution, by the authority of young Philos, Philostros Nephew, so was it his pleasure to have her self carried prisoner into her Fathers Kingdom of Lydia , as he was resolved to dispose of the person of Narcissus , according to his own will and intentions in the Kingdom of Syria: presently upon the apprehension of the dream (as she said) she wakened, with some kinde of seeming trouble more then ordinary, as the people about her had informed her. Roxana finding her Mistresse, notwithstanding her professions, to be something discomposed, either by reason of the distempers of her sickness, or in regard of the distraction of her apprehension, having belike before she went to sleep, filled her imagination with some unprofitable thoughts proceeding from the discourse of former actions or conceptions, told her, that as it was the greatest folly in the world (if not a most supream impiety) to put any manner of confidence or belief in dreams unpleasant, that were ingendred onely in the fancy by meer accidents, meeting with the indisposition of the body, so if the Gods at any time had a will, we should be instructed in things to come necessary to be known, they would certainly send us for true information to Oracles, that are not to be held fallible in any kinde: of the contrary, the motions that proceed from our selves, are for the most part governed by passions; and so consequently not to be relyed upon, although sometimes I cannot deny, said she, but they happen accordingly, though no otherwise then like as a person should cast a stone over a house, and by meer fortune might kill a bird of the other side; for though the stone had but that one place to light in to do the thing, yet by meer fortune it might as well light there as any where else: But however this short discourse, reasonably well quieted the Princesses thoughts for the present; yet both she and Roxana fell upon a resolution, with all possible speed to haste their Journey towards the Island of Cyprus ; as well for that they doubted not, but to meet Narcissus to their extraordinary content and satisfaction there; as of the other side, not conceiving Crete to be a place of sufficient security any long time, in regard of those many factions and disturbances in the Countrey, depending upon several interests, according to the relations of Dedalus the Governour; for besides the inconstant natures of the people, with the small authority the King seemed to have by way of Jurisdiction, over the very actions and affairs of his own party, (as they were informed) could they be very confident of the fidelity of the City of Pergame , where they for the present remained; in regard the Senate of Lydia by occasion of Trade, seemed to have a kinde of hidden influence, in the thoughts and affections of most of the Inhabitants: nevertheless, although Cloria and her Governess might have these passionate desires, of removing with all expedition, yet neither the distempers of the Princess, or the commodity of the Syrian Vessel that had conveighed them thither, as yet afforded them the conveniency. But whilst their expectations from day to day waited the opportunity, Dedalus of a sudden had intelligence, that the old Cretans , having newly given the Myssians in their Countrey a kinde of a desperate overthrow, esteeming themselves thereby at more liberty to act as they pleased, were marching in all haste against the Walls of Pergame , with an intention, as 'twas said, to obtain the absolute Jurisdiction both of the Town and Haven. The Governour upon this, after he had made the Princess Cloria acquainted with the news, assembled the chief Magistrates of the City, whereby not onely to take their advice, but to demand their assistance; however all the benefit this Congregation produced towards the end he intended, was to break up the meeting in distracted Councells, instead of more settled resolutions; for he found some were for the Senate of Lydia , and the Myssians , others again declared their affections to be most inclinable for the proceedings and Religion of the ancient Natives; though the third sort of people, however fewest in number, declared for the Princess Cloria and himself; but Dedalus finding, he could not build his determinations upon these uncertainties, wherein both the safety of the Town and his own honour, might probably suffer, by reason of the protraction; as also the person of the Princess Cloria be endangered by his slowness and neglect, he quickly mustered up all the Souldiers of the Castle, with such others of the Kings party in the City, that were willing to obey his command, with an intention according to Roxana's perswasion, onely to guard and defend the Walls and the Bullwarks of the Town from any sudden surpize of the Rebels; not conceiving himself able to contend equally with them in the Field, by reason of their numbers and provision: no sooner was this resolution of his publickly made known in the general to the people, but the most part of them, began with open mouthes to exclaim against his intentions, calling him Traytor and Coward, with a thousand other words of most infamous langauge, pretending he durst not issue out into the field to fight with the enemy, for fear of his own person, though it were thereby to secure all their lives and estates: As this mad rage in the multitude, was kindled by the Myssians Faction in the City, as doubting if it were not speedily prevented, the old Cretan Natives might probably become masters of the place, and so by consequence they should be hindred of their Trade and Commerce with Smyrna , and other Haven Towns belonging to the Senate of Lydia ; so was Dedalus forced to issue out into the Field, and venture a Battle with the Rebels, which he performed with so gallant a bravery, that within few hours time he dislodged most of their Troops from about and near the walls of Pergame . But three or four dayes after, thinking to return again into the Town with both honour and authority, he was suddenly (contrary to his expectation) violently opposed and denyed entrance at the gates of the City, the Inhabitants pretending that he onely seemed to have put the enemy to flight, when he had resolved to deliver up the Town into their hands: Dedalus in the interim being enflamed with this ungrateful proceedings of his Countreymen, resolved by power and force of arms, to gain a new entrance to his old command; and to this purpose, although his Souldiers were not many, he began to make formal Trenches, as if he intended a long and continued siege, whereby again to bring the people to their wonted and ancient obedience, to that jurisdiction he held under the King his master, as supposing neither their strength or skill, would long be able to contend with his right and power: but alas! they had already too craftily prevented his purposes, by more preventing designs; for as soon as they fell upon these resolutions, to keep him by strong hand out of the Town, they sent privately to those Lydian ships that lay dispersed over the Seas, with a full declaration of their intentions, which was to render themselves obedient to the Senates commands; of which a considerable number was already come into the Haven, to take possession of the City, whereby to receive the peoples offers in that nature, with a promise also of their parts, to afford them protection both in war and peace, against all those that should oppose. This being soon made known to Dedalus , he had no other way, but to endeavour the best conditions he could both for himself and the Princess, to which effect Commissioners of each side were appointed to treat; since as he could not altogether have declined this remedy, so with no probable hope, could he have expected the gaining of the Town by force, in regard of those supplies which remained in the ships newly come into the Haven, to strengthen the Inhabitants endeavours and resolutions; of the other side, being obliged to lye with all his Forces in the Fields before the walls of Pergame , without either supplies or provision, he was in certain danger to be destroyed by the old Natives, who not many dayes before by his valour and conduct, he had disgracefully chased from the Siege. However the Princess Cloria , when she came to the assured knowledge of these unfortunate passages, by which her own liberty seemed again to be circumscribed, by a new though a more inferiour jurisdiction, although she could not be but sufficiently sensible of the unhappiness of such a subjection, yet she resolved to meet her captivity with such a majesty, as either would bring revenge upon her person, in regard of her Fathers contentions, or procure a respectfull compassion from her enemies, that might defend her Dignity from all oppression: with these thoughts (as if she had been of a sudden miraculously cured of her distempers) she called for her clothes, whereby the better to put her courageous determinations in execution, when any violence to that purpose should be attempted: but Roxana upon the instant coming into her chamber, and finding her body not in a capacity to answer to that resolution of her minde, not onely gave her counsel to lye still, and expect as yet the farther event of things during the Treaty, but also entred into more necessary discourses with her, concerning what was to be thought upon and done, in this unlucky conjuncture of affairs; although she could not apprehend much danger would happen, either to her person or quality by this accident: To this purpose she used this language unto her as she lay in her bed: Madam, said she, put the worst, which is to be made prisoners to this new power, that as you see, hath not onely driven out Dedalus from his command, but probably will now circumvent all our other designs, if they can finde the opportunity: They must either carry you into Lydia , or send you home into Cyprus ; if they conduct you into Lydia , they cannot certainly be so inhumane, as to debar you from the sweet society of your most Honoured and Noble Father, in whose conversation you will not onely be delighted, as it may be imagined with a most supreme felicity, but also you will have the commodity, to impart unto him your secret resolution, concerning the intended marriage, between my Lord Narcissus and your self, which perhaps is a conveniency you would be most unwilling to miss; and in some sort requisite before you absolutely finish those other ceremonies, which in effect as you know, must have been performed either in person or by Deputy, to render you fully satisfied in your thoughts; since as you may remember you made an open profession to that purpose: Besides, how do you know, but that you may finde your Father in such a prosperous condition, that by the absolutely subjection of his enemies, your Mother the Queen may again be called home to her old honours and felicities in Lydia? which would be the convenientest and best Theatre, whereon to act the happy parts of your most glorious Nuptials: Of the contrary, if they should send you into Cyprus , certainly you should be in the place according to your own wishes, since all this while you have endeavoured the expedition and success of that journey, as the last seeming period of your desires, after all your strange and several adventures; esteeming it as a full satisfaction from the Gods, in recompence of your so many troubles and hazzards: neither let it ever enter into your thoughts, that the Senate of Lydia will in any kinde, either endanger your person or restrain your liberty; for that, as such intentions would afford them no manner of benefit whatsoever, in their contentions with the King your Father (since there are already many of the Royal Issue out of their power and possession) so would it not onely cause a more general hate upon their actions throughout all Asia , but highly exasperate your Uncle Orsames against their proceedings; to the endangering certainly, of a new War between Syria and Lydia , which no doubt but the Senate will endeavour to prevent, by all means possible they can invent. Yet however Roxana might be of these opinions, or that she onely used such discourses, the better to encourage the Princess; nevertheless it was not many dayes before the Senates Sea Forces declared their intentions; which was absolutely to conduct Cloria into Lydia , restrained in her person, until (as they said) the farther pleasure of the Senate, should be known concerning her particular; withal pretending they had a peremptory commission to execute according to this purpose; proceeding belike from the untoward endeavour of that Ambassadour at Memphis , that had been imployed by Philos , to destroy the Loves between Cloria and Narcisssus: As for Dedalus , all the conditions he could procure for himself, was, upon their undertaking to pay him thirty Talents for the discharge of his Souldiers, and the defraying of his necessary expences, presently to lay down Arms and quit the Island of Crete ; yet if he pleased, being so agreed between them, he might visit the Kingdom of Lydia , until such time he should more commodiously prepare his occasions, for his absolute transportation into forreign parts. 'Tis true Roxana cast about many wayes in her working thoughts, how yet to alter or prevent these determinations of carrying the Princess Cloria into Lydia a prisoner: First she fancies to steal out of the Town, to those Forces which Dedalus had in a Body entire without the Walls; and notwithstanding the agreement, to animate their spirits to stand for the Kings right and the Princess safety: But finding they both needed necessary provisions, and were in danger in their persons hourly to be cut off by the old Cretans , that lay every where dispersed over the whole Countrey, who hated them as they knew equal with the Myssians ; she thought that would be a project of no great consequence to their benefit; then again she imagined, that perchance they might use some stratagem, to be conveyed privately out of the Haven, by some hired Ship to that purpose; and by that means concealedly get into the Island of Cyprus , according to their former intentions: However when she remembred she was told, that the Officers of the Senates Forces, had lately not onely taken a strict account of all the Vessels that remained in the Harbour, but had also put in new Commanders of their own in every Ship, she supposed with no probability whatsoever, could they attempt such a design without being revealed; and then they might come to be worse used in their confinement: Whereas now the Princess was promised all honour, favour, and respect according to her Dignity in the journey. And lastly she conceited, that perchance they might finde not onely reception but protection in the Armies of the ancient Natives: But when she considered the inconstancy of their dispositions, the rudeness of their customs, with their several particular interests, she thought it a vanity, if not a madness to put in execution any such design; and the rather for that the Princes Cloria her self, was not yet so perfectly recovered of her health, that she could possibly expose her person to those uncertainties, both in travel, and dyet, with other inconveniencies, that she would necessarily be obliged to suffer amongst those unpolisht Troops: Wherefore the old woman being in her opinion convinced in all these particulars, she perswaded her Mistriss, with a kinde of a Majesty mixt with affability and kindness, to entertain both her fortunes, and those Commanders that should be designed to conduct her under the jurisdiction of the Senate, since as yet they could not by any means learn, what probably might be resolved of, concerning the farther disposure of their persons, upon their arrival in the Kingdom of Lydia . It was not many dayes when the Princess Cloria had declared her self, both fit and willing, to undertake a journey, that the Admiral at Sea, (who had been sent out by the direction of the Ambassadour, that remained as was formerly related at Memphis ) conducted the sweet Princess with her Governess, into his own Ship, where he had prepared a magnificent Cabin for her reception; but whether so adorned out of any intention thereby the better to win her belief, or out of the humanity of his own nature I cannot tell: Yet so it was, in that unwelcome Triumph, that both the Fleet and the Seas themselves received them with a prosperous winde, which in two dayes and a night or thereabouts, landed them in the fair and ancient Haven of Smyrna , where they reposed not much longer, before they were conveyed by many gallant Troops of Horse (by the Senates directions) to a brave Castle of the Kings, seated upon a hill not very far off the great City of Sardis , where they had not onely time enough to rest, but to exercise abundantly their own thoughts, since as they knew they were confined, so were they in a manner out of hopes to know for how long. Some weeks after the said Princess, and her affectionate Governess, had remained imprisoned in the Castle, which the Senate had ordered for their confinement, spending their time for the most part in fruitless complaints, accompanied with more tears, of a sudden Roxana one day as she was sitting in a low Parlor, that opened a Balcona-window into the Park, where many tame Deer grazed, that all the Winter were accustomed to be fed by the hand, for the pleasure formerly of the King, who upon his retirement from troublesome affairs, would repair thither for the better privacy of recreation, was saluted by a young Gentleman, of more then ordinary beauty and comeliness of person, who after he had with a certain winning behaviour made up between confidence and humility, bestowed some complements upon her, he uttered this language: Madam, said he, not finding the excellent Princess Cloria so apt and capable for my discourse at present, as I wish she were, in regard of those despairing sorrows, that seem to cloud so many admirable perfections, that were wont to give new lustres to the world, and may again notwithstanding these ominous interpositions, that seem to be governed, not onely by a cruel but a most presumptuous and unmannerly fate, if she can but be wrought to such a confidence and belief of my intentions, concerning her service, as is not onely convenient but most necessary for the season: For however the office I now seem to hold under the Senates jurisdiction, is cause (I must confess) or suspicion enough, to the most strongest perswasions; yet I call all the Gods to witness, who best know my heart, that I harbour never a thought inwardly, that doth not entirely wish a most supream happiness to every action, that Euarchus can think may again bring him to the uttermost height, of all his ancient Honours and Dignities, though the circumstances and reasons of my affections, in regard of my present condition, are too many and various at this time to be disputed: But if this belief of my loyalty, shall take that place with your charity, as I humbly desire it may, I shall then discovet unto you such passages, lately come to my knowledge, that will not onely probably secure the Princess from a Storm coming upon her, which perhaps she would most willingly avoid, but also put her in a way of so absolute a happiness, that I dare be bold to say, neither her hopes nor yours can yet arrive unto. Roxana however she knew not (notwithstanding all his violent professions) how to be over confident of his intentions, yet in regard both of the necessity of their condition, as also having some kinde of reasons given her, by the earnestness of his language, and the ingenuity of his countenance, to be something plyable to his discourse, she thought it at leastwise the safest way, to comply with his offer, without any seeming jealousie whatsoever: And to this purpose, after she had abundantly thanked him for his extraordinary courtesie, she told him, both her Ladies obligations and her own, would be exceedingly augmented, by any information he should give of the Senates intentions, since as yet, they could finde nothing but effects of their cruelty; and much more if by his assistance, they might winde themselves out of their present troubles and future dangers. Then Lady, said he, as the story I have to tell, concerns Prince Cassianus fortunes, since his departure out of Lydia , wherein the Princess Cloria is involv'd, so must I desire your leave, to prosecute all those circumstances that belong to the relation; however perhaps they may not be altogether judged, so necessary to the matter by your discerning judgement; yet in regard the passages cannot be but something delightful to your fancy, I shall make bold to presume upon your patience, since truly they are both admirable, and almost past all belief. Know then, that Cassianus at his being at the Court of Lydia , though his business in outward view, seemed to pretend to nothing, but the procuring assistance from the King, to regain his lost Countrey of Iberia ; yet secretly I must tell you, he fell in love with the Princess Cloria , which however he durst not discover: In this posture he continued between hope and despair, until the arrival of the old Queen Anaxia (as he believed) drowned all his encouragements, in a vast Sea of impossibility; for that she brought with her in her journey, certain propositions full of honour and benefit to Euarchus Court, from the King of Egypt , concerning a marriage between the fair Princess and his Son and Heir Osiris ; which caused Cassianus that night, when all the world was imployed about the triumphant sports, that were designed for the entertainment of the Queen of Syria , to leave Lydia: Belike being put on to those resolutions, by his melancholly apprehensions, which however as you very well know, so enflamed the whole Kingdom, by the spightful practises of factious Dimogoras , joyned with the crafty insinuations of others of the same interest; that it proved a main occasion, that since hath disquieted the King in his Government. But Cassianus himself, who had left Lydia ingendring certain black Clouds of Malignant vapours, that afterwards became furious storms of blood and slaughter (though I cannot say he was any way guilty in their effects; for Princes Titles and Interests are oftentimes abused to sinister ends and purposes) retired in person, under the jurisdiction of an ancient Forrest, not many dayes journey from the Court, where sometimes he privately lived, delighting his solitary intentions, with the exercise of hunting, and other rural delights, which those pleasant Woods, and that fruitful Countrey plentifully afforded his nature and fortune: But not long it was before Hyacinthia our Queen also, by reason of the inflamations of Lydia , was forced to quit her Husbands Kingdom, by which accident, as you know, she met in that place, with the company of her banished Brother Candalus, outed in like manner of all his happiness, by the powerful Authority of Philostros great Favourite to Orsames . As most of these passages were within the compass of your own intelligence, which I have related onely for my stories better method, so now I shall presume to inform you, of such particulars, as you have not yet heard of; for Cassianus remaining as I said in the delightful Forrest, and going under the borrowed and abbreviated name of Cassa , being disguised in the habit of a young Huntsman, upon the Queens arrival presented himself to your view, though not to your knowledge: By which encounter, he was encouraged, again to prosecute his old love (almost laid asleep by time and separation) to the Princess Cloria , since the conveniency (as he thought) could not be bettered; and in that manner resolved to wait upon the Queen undiscovered into Syria: Nevertheless in that intended voyage as you know, both himself and Eumenes suffered shipwrack; however Cassianus (though the other perished) by the propitiousness of the Heavens, escaped in a manner miraculously the desperate danger of the Sea, and entered into such adventures as scarce can be parallel'd: for his body being supported, upon a flat Chest full of Jewels belonging to himself, by the onely flowing of the water, was carried into certain Nets belonging to poor Fishermen, who finding a young man full of beauty, though almost dead by the violent agitation of the Waves, after they had recovered some life in him, presented him to a Lords Daughter of the Countrey called Brisania , as a subject worth her best compassion: But the Lady whether taken with the youth and beauty of her patient, or having an inclination to affect that she had once preserved, of a sudden fell in love with his lovely person, since she had no motives to be inticed by the knowledge of his Titles, he having concealed himself, the better to perform his intended journey into Syria: And this love at last from small sparkles, began to encrease to a great flame, though for a long time Cassianus was not informed of the Ladies passions; for her Virgin modesty ever supprest the declaration of that, which she had much adoe to hide, until the secret fire was discovered by the sharpsight of another suitor, that had already procured the good will of her Father for their future marriage; notwithstanding another rival by a more noble love, contended with the former for preheminence: In the interim that these intricate affections seemed to act several parts, the old Lord by his unexpected death, left his fair Daughter to inherit rather misfortune, then jurisdiction; for Fridius her hated Lover (being so called) presently seized both upon her Person and Countrey, pretending that her Father in his last Will, had instituted him the sole Governour of her Minority, lest she might endanger both her honour and safety by some inconsiderable match; resolving withal to make Cassianus a Sacrifice, or a Petitioner to compass his ends: to which purpose, he caused him publickly to be accused, that he intended to have betrayed the Town and Countrey to a Forreign Power; under pretence of freeing Brisania from prison, who seemed also to have consented to the practise, whereby to have procured her own releasement. And this being falsly laid to his charge he was unjustly condemned; however Fridius suspended the Execution, until he had not onely again attempted the Ladies consent to his offered Love, but procured Cassianus , who went by the borrowed name of Cassa , to be himself a Sollicitor in his Suit; which opportunely gave Brisania occasion, instead of granting Fridius his request, to discover her own love; but Cassianus became rather confused then pleased at this discovery, since the hazzard of his own life could but purchase the acceptance; insomuch as onely with a sorrowful courtship he entertained her discourse, however she gave him leave to depart, and carry her peremptory denial to the proud Tyrant. Nevertheless poor Cassa was to be made the object of his spleen, since Brisania would not be the subject of his love; for some few dayes after he was brought to a publick Scaffold erected before the Castle Window, where Brisania remained, that she might be the better witness of the bloody Tragedy intended; Cassa appeared in a mourning habit, becoming the sadness of his present condition, but much more clouded in his sorrowful countenance, that shewed his deiected minde; though his beauty had yet so large a possession in his person, by the opinion of the people, that he seemed a Sun shaded in a dark Skie, that notwithstanding shot forth bright beams under the black coverture; and in this manner was he lead to the Theatre of death in the view of the people, who accompanied him all the way with their liberal lamentation, since these were the onely sacrifices they could offer in his behalf; for although he was esteemed amongst them but a private Gentleman of Iberia , yet could they not chuse but grieve to see, a youth of his natural perfections, untimely brought to his destruction, by the cruelty of a wicked Tyrant: But in the mean time, poor Brisania summoned to the spectacle by the noise of the spectators, at the first sight began to feel new passions in her gentle bosom, not so much of love as pitty, since the prisoner himself, had by divers messages solicited her to yield, rather then to make him the onely object of Fridius his hate: Wherefore, first she laid before her thoughts the innocency of the prisoner that was to suffer, onely because she continued wilful. Then she began to think, there was nothing but her own miserable captivity could redeem his life; religion, charity and affection pleaded of one side, as hatred, honour, and courage contended of the other, which made her sometimes resolve to break through the crowds, and fling her self at Fridius his feet to beg his pardon: But then her spirit again disdaining such a submission, rather chusing to cast her person amongst the people, and by her own death incite their revenge, Whilst these considerations tormented her gentle soul, and that his approaching execution seemed to exact from her consent a speedy resolution, at the further end of the Market-place appeared a confused fear amongst the common people, which was quickly seconded, not onely with cryes of I reason, but with the noise of many warlike instruments, tending to the surprize of the Town; so that the Scaffold that was ordained to be the Stage where Cassa was to act his last part, became soon emptied of all those unwelcome assistances, and he left onely to be his own prisoner; an accident certainly that sufficiently pleased him, although his amazed joy, had scarce belief enough to apprehend he was freed, which made him longer continue that posture the executioner had put him in, then his good fortune required at his hands; so that he moved not, until one of the Souldiers wisht him to pray for the life of Saxanius , who had delivered him from death. By which declaration it was quickly known throughout all the Market-place, that Brisania's first Suitor, had both saved Cassa from destruction, and possest himself of the City, who hearing of the cruel captivity of his dear Mistriss by the wicked tyranny of Fridius , had assembled all his friends to her rescue, and by a neat stratagem, had happily brought about the design for her delivery, and her enemies punishment: Fridius sufficiently apprehensive of the guilt of his own Treason, staid not to dispute the right of his cause with his victorious rival, but presently retired under the safe protection of the strong Castle, where he supposed was a Garrison able to contend, whilst other succours came to his assistance; besides he had Brisania in his power, by whose Authority and Title he imagined the better to retain the obedience of the people. But Saxanius intending neither to be slothful in his love or hate, after he had given some orders for the surer obedience of the Town, soon placed a formal Siege before the Fort where his Mistriss was imprisoned, with so great a probability of prevailing, that within some few dayes he received a Message from wicked Fridius , that if he did not presently retire himself and his Troops from before the Castle, he vow'd by all the Gods, that Brisania should act the first part in that Tragedy was intended: And for the greater assurance of his intention, he caused the Lady to be brought upon the Leads, where were already prepared the circumstances of her death. Saxanius after he had understood this peremptory demand from the proud Tyrant, and beheld with his sorrowful eyes, the threatned danger of his fair Mistriss, for whose safety he had ingaged not onely his own courage, but the valours also of all his friends and kindred, became tormented with many thoughts, and divers resolutions, since if he absolutely performed the commanding request of his hated rival, he was no more secured (as he supposed) of Brisania's preservation, then if he should yield to nothing he desired, but rather gave Fridius the more liberty to be cruel, when he had no occasion to fear; and for any promise he could make, it was to be esteemed like the rest of his false actions: Wherefore he almost determined to send away the Herald with a threatning denial, instead of a submissive consent. But then reflecting upon the apprehensions of his dear love, who as he believed, would imagine that he esteemed much more a little honour then the saving of her life, it destroyed his former half resolution, and entered him again into new and confused considerations, which were lost in his desperate breast with diversity of passions, until casting his sad eyes towards the place where Brisania was, as a pure sacrifice to be offered according to his imagination, who seemed in his apprehension already to accuse him of unworthy love, that could so long dispute in his minde her preservation; of a sudden he might see one cast headlong from the top of the Castle into the Ditch; which too soon perswaded his belief that the wicked Tyrant had prevented his judgement, by performing the execution before the return of his Messenger: So that he remained like one that seemed to be changed into a Marble Statue, until a Flag of Truce appeared joyfully upon the Castle, as a testimony of future friendship: However Saxanius could not be satisfied in the Omen , until a Messenger from the Fort assured him, not onely of the Ladies safety, but also of the death of Fridius ; with this relation, that the Souldiers of the Fort, neither being able to endure their Princess captivity, nor the Tyrants cruelty, had by force rescued their Mistriss, and committed a supream justice upon his person; who now was sent from Brisania to know, what conditions the besiegers expected, both for her liberty and the Town they had already conquered. But Saxanius would make no Articles at all with his Love, for after he had disposed of his Troops into several Quarters, he went to present himself a slave to the fair Captive he had redeemed, where he intended to chain his freedom for ever. However Cassianus finding that he was not onely fallen into some disdain, by reason of those desires he exprest for his own preservation, as also Saxanius likely to take possession of those favours he might have enjoyed, imagined there was no way to preserve him still in the good will of his Lady, but to discover his quality, which he supposed would both advance his esteem, and lessen his rivals credit; and by that means become a publick pretender to Brisania , which notwithstanding produced no other effects then a challenge from Saxanius , which Cassianus in honour could not refuse, after he had given sufficient testimonies of his condition to be a Prince and no wandring Stranger. Yet however the day was appointed for the Combat, and every ones expectation attended the final event of the Quarrel, Brisania's Nurse called Rhena promised to satisfie all parties without danger or blood, provided her Mistriss would be directed by her Councels, and become Wife to him whom the Heavens had ordained to be her Husband. This strange intricacy, gave curious desires to multitudes of people to be present at the wonder, since both the Champions were resolved not to be soiled in their Honour, scarce in their Loves; wherefore they came into the Field armed, to supply the defect of the old womans performance, according to her bold promise: But when they were prepared to have ended the difference by a bloody encounter, Rhena intreated them they would first repair to the great Temple to sacrifice to the immortal Gods, where she said, she might perhaps relate such a story, that would satisfie all their desires. This proposition from the old woman, although it carried not with it much probability of according the rivals, their quarrel being grounded upon a difference, that knew not how to admit of any competition, when gratitude it self seemed to have no place in Cassianus disposition, though he enjoyed his life by the fortunate favour of Saxanius ; yet by the importunate cryes of the people, who began to be less curious and more pittiful, they were perswaded to follow her directions; and being before the Altar encompassed round about by the expecting multitude, Rhena after she had called the Heavens to witness, of the truth of what she intended to utter, delivered this relation, which as she said, she had bound her self by a vow never to declare, until some necessity not to be avoided forced from her the discovery. When beauteous Elizana , said she, the vertuous Mother of Prince Cassianus here present, was constrained with her dear Husband, to flye from the Countrey of Mesopotamia by the prevailing power of Artaxes general, in the way being great with Childe, she was forced to retire to the house of my late Lord, Father to Brisania , whose Wife was her near Kinswoman, and at the same time great also, where she had not remained many dayes before she was delivered of a fair Daughter, as my Lady not long after of another, to the joy of the whole house: However, the Gods esteeming my Mistriss too good for this life, took her out of this world before she had finished the moneth of her Child-birth to the unspeakable sadness both of her Husband, and all her Servants, leaving no issue to inherit her singular vertues but a Daughter onely. Elizana also being quickly called away by her own troubles, left her little infant unto my education, as my Lord also trusted me with his Jewel: But accidents and the Wars in Armenia growing every day more hot then other, for the better security and quiet, I was perswaded with the two Children, to retire to my own house, where we remained for some years, they contented to be each others companion, as I happy to be both their Foster Mother, since they increased not so fast in dayes and nights as in beauty and goodness; but alas the Fates were envious at our felicity, and took one of them out of the world, and with these words the old woman wept, with the remembrance of her dear loss, until her many tears running down her aged cheeks, gave some interruption to her discourse: But finding her grief was scarce seasonable to the passionate multitude, she wiped her eyes, and then proceeded: When the violence of the War, said she, became so qualified, that Parents had some leasure to enjoy the comfort of their Children; I presented my Lord with a beautiful Daughter; though for the other I had in charge, I desired his favour to make my excuse, since it was not in my power to prevent the will of the Gods, which gave him so much satisfaction, that he perswaded Elizana by letter to be content that had many more, which continued until my Lady Brisania by his late death as you know, became heir to all his possessions, though interrupted some time by wicked Fridius , and redeemed by valiant Saxanius , to whom without a great deal of ingratitude she cannot but give her self, and all that she hath, since she hath received it from his hands. At which words Cassianus began to muster up within his breast a multitude of passions, until the old woman turning towards him, told him, that presently she would render him satisfied also: Wherefore, after the people were a little quieted in their confused murmur, she thus ended her story: But now said she to unriddle this mystery, and fully to perform my promise I must let know, that Brisania was not childe to your late deceased Governour, but Daughter to worthy Elizana ; I onely using that fallacy upon the death of the other, because I feared the loss to my Lord would have proved a vexation intollerable, since he wanted Children to inherit his Fortune and Honour; and for Elizana I supposed the crosse would not appear so great, in respect of the bountifulnesse of the issue, which the Gods had bestowed upon her; however I made a private vow to my self, as I said, never to discover this mystery, until some pressing occasion forced from me the declaration, as well to retain Brisania in her supposed Fathers possessions, as to take from their Parents all jealousie of my fraud. But since the Heavens by the power and right of Conquest, have now establisht my Lord Saxanius in that Government, which Brisania did intend innocently to usurp, and that his noble pretensions to her love, deserve her best entertainment, as if the Gods intended a perpetual unity in their hearts against all obstacles, I hope it will be the opinion of all here present, that the marriage between them be solemnized instantly in the Temple; and the rather for that I cannot doubt, Prince Cassianus will forbid the conjunction, since nature denies him the capacity of such a happiness. This Declaration was quickly warranted by the desires of all the people with loud acclamations; so that Brisania turning about to Saxanius with a blush that more enflamed his joy, after a little pause saluted him with this language: My Lord, said she, for so it should seem the destinies have designed you against all difficulties, though whether I shall be now esteemed worthy in your vertuous thoughts, to give you that Title may be some question, since your noble addresses formerly received not those ready entertainments they merited: However, I shall endeavour to perswade you to believe, that the Heavens have had a secret influence, whereby the better to unite our selves, since my preposterous affection to my Brother upon small grounds, endeavoured something to obscure your perfections in my apprehension, which now appear to my knowledge, in a most full and affectionate prospect, that absolutely delights all my senses. And with that, as if she had been too liberal in her language, like a Rose over-prest with the nights dew, by little and little cast down her lovely looks upon the ground. Saxanius instead of delivering his judgement concerning Brisania's plea, put in execution his intended decree by a gentle kiss upon her fair lips, which gave the people sufficient intelligence of his thoughts; so that the marriage became presently solemnized, to the content of all the standers by, but more specially to themselves, whose happiness could not fully be apprehended but in the fruition onely. And this Madam I say, is the delightful, though intricate story of Cassianus adventures, since his departure out of Lydia , which he was pleased to signifie in writing under his own hand; however to none but to his faithful friend and chiefest counsellour Dimogoras . But now that I have entertained your ears with these strange though pleasant passages; as I may say, seemingly rather miracles, then accidents, I shall come nearer a great deal to your concernments: This intelligence of the safety of the Prince you must know, enflamed the thoughts of Dimogoras ; whereupon he began to consider, if a marriage could be compassed between Cloria the Kings Daughter and Cassianus , it would undoubtedly, not onely strengthen his own greatness, but exceedingly fortifie all manner of contentions of the Senate, with Euarchus the King, since by this means his Daughter should not be matched to any Forreign Prince, that might give her Father assistance; but rather by degrees would be wrought to be an enemy to his pretensions and desires. With these considerations he went presently to the Senate, whereby to make them acquainted with the intelligence he had received: And to this purpose, being sat in the Councel, he uttered this kinde of speech, with as much eloquence as his natural roughness, and want of education could deliver. My Lords, said he, as it is most evident, the Gods have hitherunto prospered our attempts in a most admirable manner, to the wonder of all Asia ; so of the other side may we again behold, a kinde of miraculous influence depending upon those accidents, signified unto me by Prince Cassianus Letters: These things being considered, I see no reason, nay I may boldly affirm there is a great deal of piety in the resolution, both belonging to the service of the Gods, as also towards the establishing of our own affairs, to endeavour all wayes possible, to unite the persons and affections of Cloria the Kings Daughter, and Cassianus the adventerous Prince, in such indissolvable tyes of Love and Marriage, that may not onely render them happy themselves, but secure us from all fear of a Forreign Cunjunction, that undoubtedly would disorder (if not destroy) that work we have already wisely begun, and hope shall fortunately end in this Kingdome. For my part I must confess, I do almost tremble, yet when I consider in how great a hazzard our affairs stood, before your Admiral surprized the Princess at Pergame ; for that the alliance intended between her self and Narcissus , could not have been other then ominous; when as of the other side we are most assured, to finde Cassianus upon all occasions, not onely a furtherer of our designs, but a lover of our persons. Perhaps you may be a little startled with the doubts, that Cloria will scarce be brought to think of such Nuptials; but truly these are meerly frivolous considerations, in comparison of benefits of States, and Kingdoms: wherefore I say, if she cannot be perswaded to yield her consent, by the influence of his Courtship, she must be compelled by your power and authority. So that my opinion is, that Cassianus be presently sent for, not onely to put in execution, with all expedition, what we shall determine for our own happiness, and the Kingdoms welfare; but also to be honoured and maintained by our loves and affections, according to our former resolution and promises. Let it suffice there seemeth already a sympathy in their years, beauty, and religion; and what wants of Titles and Possessions, our Authorities must make up, to be supplied according to accidents and occasions; for that in point of honour, as I intimated before, we are obliged by many promises, not onely to settle this injured Prince, again in his lost Dominions, but to render him as happy as we can by our endeavours. This Oration being delivered with more violence then Rhetorick, he sate down in his place expecting the issue: which produced not onely several discourses, but much seeming contention, in regard of divers and sundry interests: yet Dimogoras , with others of the same Faction, so far prevailed at last, that it was absolutely decreed that Cassianus should with all expedition be sent for, with an assurance of the intended match between him and the Princess Cloria . When Creses had made an end of thus much of his discourse, he rested silent, as it were expecting some kinde of reply from Roxana: but finding the old woman at leastwise troubled, if not something confounded at the relation, he began anew with her in this manner. Truly, said he, it were a kinde of disservice, onely to mention dangers to torment your apprehension; and not at the same time to propound remedies that might probably cure the disease; which would turn all my professed courtesies into nothing but causes of jealousie and suspition: Wherefore, Madam, as the time that will be given, for the solicitations of Cassianus cannot be long; his arrival being expected every hour, many weeks being past since he was sent for to Sardis : so must you speedily resolve upon the prevention, unless you are willing to comply with the Senates intentions. In short, be your thoughts and resolutions what they will, I make bold to assure you, if you dare but give sufficient confidence to my promises; or doubt not my capacity to perform them, to deliver the Princess Cloria and your self free from your present imprisonment; which being effected, you may retire under the protection of Euarchus the King at Philadelphia ; yet I must leave the particulars to further discourses, when I may be assured of your resolutions: but if neither my design, or faith please you; for that perchance I seem to be at present, what notwithstanding I intend not to be many dayes, I must conjure you not to discover these motions to any, but to your Lady, which is a justice I hope your honour and goodness cannot deny me. It was a question whether this story and offer did more amaze or content Roxana , since as she did not expect the one, so she could not hope for the other: notwithstanding with few circumstances, and a great deal of thanks, she entertained his motion, confirmed with her strong protestations of all their gratitudes to that service he should perform; which was enough to part them at present, by reason of the passion the old woman had to inform the Princess. Roxana , although she acquainted her Mistress with these pleasing propositions, (who apprehended them sent by the Gods for their good) yet she resolved in her thoughts to enquire after the party and his interest, by which she intended to lay the ground of those Councels she would use. To this purpose, after some few dayes she became informed, that he was a young Nobleman of Lyria , called Creses , employed by the Senate in the Government of the Countrey about the Castle, which made her also observe his actions, whereby she might learn, whether it were a new instructed duty that taught him better obedience to the Kings service then formerly? Or whether some discontent of his other Lords proceedings at Sardis , in regard of his own person, caused him revengefully to put off his trust? But as within the compass of some weeks she was satisfied it was neither of these reasons that gave him an appetite to leave his command, and begin a new Loyalty to his King: so of the other side she became assured in her opinion, that his secret love to the Princess Cloria was the principal cause that made him offer so acceptable a service, to the hazzard of his own life; and with this knowledge fell into many considerations with her Mistress, whether it were better with security of their persons, still to remain in the Castle, where they were under the jurisdiction of the Senate, and to expect the vexations of Cassianus importunity upon his arrival, as Creses had informed them, or hazzard themselves under the protection of the new Lover, whose disposition and intention they were not acquainted withal; nevertheless, after long debate they fell upon the latter, which was rather absolutely to trust his passion, then expect the Senates goodness; and to that purpose Roxana told Creses in the Princesses name, that she was resolved wholly not onely to rely upon his fidelity, but to be directed in her journey to her Father by his care; which gave Creses a world of content, not alone that he was thought worthy of so great a confidence, but by this means he should free his apprehension from the danger of Cassianus Courtship; so that within a weeks space he provided all things necessary for their escape; whilst in the mean time Cloria pretended a sickness that caused her to keep her chamber, whereby no suspition of her flight might remain for some dayes after her departure, as Creses did of important business, which called him to a necessary attendance at Sardis . When the designed night came that they were to begin their journey, which was expected with some impatience, the Princess, Roxana , and their intrusted Dwarf, the onely attendants they would use for fear of discovery; repaired to a place at the foot of the Castle hill, where one Sentinel being more curious then the rest, would have interrupted their passage, but their ready knowledge of the Word gave him a quick discharge, and so consquently set them free to take their Horses, that were provided not far off by Creses care, who was there also attending himself to mount the Princess, and the other company: Scarce had the chearful morning appeared in the East, after a tedious nights travel in rough and unbeaten wayes, when they arrived at an even plain, that not onely afforded them some consolation, to sweeten their past inconvenience, but gave opportunity to Creses , reflecting upon his own trust, and enflamed by his secret love, to use this language to the Princess. Madam, said he, as I envy not the Gods happiness, in the conversation I have power to enjoy, so the trust that is committed to my care, deserves a diligence beyond expression, wherein if I had a thousand lives, they were all too few to be employed in such a service; yet give me leave to say without prophanation of your sacred self, that love is the onely price that ought to purchase your person by an honourable pitty, which cannot be wanting, where there are so many other admirable perfections; for since none can merit your vertues, your goodness will appear in the greatest lustre, when it shall be seen you chuse, because you intend absolutely to oblige, like the heavens that take most pleasure in forgiving highest offences. It may perhaps be esteemed by ignorant apprehensions, a kinde of an equality in worth, when Titles are united; but you know that dark foils are used to illustrate bright Diamonds, wherefore let not honours be the object of your looks; which however, although they cannot out-shine yours, yet certainly the clearness of your beauty will best appear, when others are removed, like the fair Moon when the Sun is most obscured that offends by his too much violence; Flowers seem more delightful in innocent Fields, then in stately Gardens; and Christal streams are plentifuller replenished with variety of watry Inhabitants, when the green Meadows give them bounds, rather then where Marble structures enrich their abode; then kissing her hand with a passionate earnestness, he bathed her white Glove with a few of his own Tears, that quickly gave Cloria Items of his intentions; but she would take no notice of his dicourse, being unwilling to disquiet her protection, since she could not condescend to his desire; so that she was constrained prettily to divert the occasion, by calling her Governess to the communication, pretending that else her rigid gravity might chide them both for their disrespect: When Roxana was arrived at a nearer distance, the Princess perceiving her to be much troubled, if not altogether tired with the past nights travel, by her often removing her self upon her Saddle, not being accustomed to many such exercises, after she had bid her be of good chear, began to question with her, concerning the practice and employment of her youth; and whether or no women in those dayes did use to ride a hunting, according to the fashions now of Lydia? Faith no Madam, said Roxana , in those times maids were more modestly bred, then to exercise such hoiting recreations; for if their mothers suffered them to walk a turn or two in the Garden, after they had performed a good dayes work upon their Samplers, and of Holydayes to go eat a mess of Cream in some honest neighbours house, it was esteemed a large liberty; besides there was a careful provision by their parents, that no men of any sort should accompany them; although they were such as pretended to be Suitors, and the conditions of marriage already agreed upon; but now by my truly, there is nothing but private Courtship and publick Love, with continual divertizements from one pleasure to another; so that young Girls endeavour nothing more, then to become bold and scandalous: nay, I can assure you Princess, said she, Maids durst not so much as smile before their Fathers and Mothers, scarce looking upon their Woers before they were married; in which bashful posture on the night of their Nuptials, they entertained their Husbands with tears onely. This discourse, or rather passion of the old woman, proceeding as 'twas supposed from the hard going of her Horse, gave Cloria occasion to tell her in a gentle smile, that the reason why they did not practice such pastimes, was because they wanted good horses for the sport, and Coaches as she had heard were not then in use: Good Horses, said Roxana , I cannot tell what you call good; but for my part I was never worse carried then at the present; at which the Princess began to laugh outright, since she had so directly hit upon the disease of her Governess. However Creses that he might prevent all quarrels told her, that since she found hers not easie, she should ride on his, which perhaps would better please her, although he protested, he had no design but to accommodate her before himself; whereupon taking her down from her saddle, in a quarter of an hours time made the exchange, though the labour seemed fruitless; for the old woman being no whit amended in the choice, shewed the defect proceeded from her age, and not from her Steed: Nevertheless most couragiously (though she did sweat for the busincess) she arrived at the Forrest, where they intended to repose themselves for the noon season, that required some shade against the suns violence: Creses chose a flourishing Tree for the Princess accommodation, which contented her thoughts as well, as the richest Canopy of State in her fathers Court, and the provision that the Dwarf had brought with him, abundantly satisfied instead of other curiosities: these satisfactions exacted from Cloria another necessary duty, that the night past had absolutely debarred her of, which was shewed by the gentle closing of her fair eyes from the dayes light; whilst in the mean time Roxana had conveniency, after she had put something under her Ladies head, to retire her self under another Tree, to be indulgent also to her own senses. But Creses whose love and care caused him to be a diligent Sentinel over the Princesses rest, afforded him also the happiness of this contemplation; in which fain he would have stollen a kiss, but that he feared the Heavens would have revealed the theft: Can the Gods (thought he) be altogether stupid, to suffer so divine a creature upon earth, and leave their own habitation barren of such excellence, since more then a thousand Cupids , are ready to offer Sacrifices upon the pure Altar of her fair Fore-head, perfumed by the Incense of her odoriferous breath? Can these two illustrious Cherries, said he, that onely kiss one another, because they cannot meet with the like perfections, be less powerful then to invite Jove from Olympus to taste of the dainties? But beholding a presumptuous flye, boldly to entertain it self in the delicious Garden of her Face, where mixt Roses and Lillies gave it both nourishment and delight, notwithstanding the many gentle prohibitions of her white hand, he began passionately to exclaim against the rudeness of the creature; yet when he saw its black colour and curious shape, served instead of a foyl to become her beauty, as if put there rather by art then nature, he not onely let the silly beast alone, but commended his industry; however finding her sleepy importunity, desired something earnestly to be rid of that troublesome ornament, he could do no less then contribute his assistance, and hastily endeavoured to chase the flye from that Paradice, where it wanted neither flowers nor exercise; at which the Princess suddenly wakened with a demand, what had disturbed her in her rest? But poor Creses durst not own the disquiet, and so she fell asleep again, in which innocent calm she remained until Roxana's confident authority, made her know it was time to prepare for the afternoons journey; and this injunction was sufficient to render her obedient against the enticements of her wearied senses. Many dayes they had not travelled in this large Forrest, to seek out obscure wayes to prevent surprize, since they supposed they should hastily be pursued, if not encountred by some of the Senates Forces, lying in a manner every night either in a poor Cottage, or in the open air, which the courageous Princess underwent with an admirable fortitude; hoping her reward at last should be not onely to see her dear Father, but to hear some news of her Love Narcissus , for whose sake her thoughts were chiefly tormented; before they arrived at a small Plain encompassed with wood, which the more flourished, because Phebus had not so absolute a dominion in that place as elsewhere. At the farther end of the Plain upon the rising of a little hill, that directed its view towards the East, they might behold a house; though not of any appearing capacity, to contain many persons; but long they had not contemplated the commodity of their supposed nights lodging, e're they spyed an old Father with a book in his hand, sitting under a Tree, which gave occasion to Creses , whilst the Princess and Roxana were content to take some pleasure in that solitude, to present himself to the aged man, as well to be informed who he was, as also to receive some benefit by his assistance. Wherefore, after they had civilly saluted one another; and that Creses had told him, he conducted certain distressed Ladies towards Philadelphia , where their friends remained in the Kings Wars; and also that they wanted for the present accommodation of lodging for the approaching night, the old man seemed not onely willing to pleasure him in any thing, but of the sudden burst forth into abundance of Tears and Complaints, as it should seem at the remembrance of Euarchus and his fortunes; which made Creses the more passionate to be informed of his condition, and to that purpose desired him, that he would be pleased to let him know what accident had driven him into that solitary course of life; so both seating themselves upon a little rising hillock, because the old Father was not capable of a long discourse without some repose, he uttered this language. Sir, said he, since you will needs be acquainted with my fortunes, you must know in my youth I was bred by the careful industry of my parents a Scholler, which profession brought me first in credit with my Prince Euarchus Father, who was himself not onely learned, but exceedingly loved the conversation of those that were possessed with such qualities, which at the first joyned with the ambition of of my own nature, made me a Courtier, and that vocation, as I thought, exacted from me a diligence to preferment; however honours were but moderately conferred upon me, during the life of the old King, though after his death his son Euarchus , whether mistaking my ability, or being in love with my fidelity, showred down so many favours upon me, that I not onely in a short time became chief Flamin of all Lydia , but in a manner governed the whole State under the King, which heaped on me sufficient envy; and the rather, since I conferred many offices possessed formerly by the Nobility upon those of my own profession, whereby the better to strengthen my party, and dignifie my condition: in this posture I remained, until the great Senate that now rules in Lydia chased me from Court and Commonweale, which made me seek out this private habitation, until the Fate of Euarchus Government shall be so determined, that I may again return to his service, or resolve to end my life in this solitude; and with that wept, which for some time continued them both in a pensive silence, until Creses importuned the aged Father to put off his sorrow; or at leastwise, suffer him to be a sharer with him in his grief, by letting him know more particularly the causes: This gave occasion to the old man to tell him plainly that many Souldiers were newly arrived in the Forrest, to shelter themselves by the protection of the Woods, from the rage of their persecutors, who followed them after a Battle that was lately fought between Thyasmus and the Senates Forces, where both he and almost his whole Army being surprized by an Ambuscado of the Enemy, had lost the day to the absolute destruction of the Kings Affairs, and an utter undoing, as 'twas believed, of all his friends, since Euarchus expects every hour in person to be besieged in Philadelphia . This unexpected news, did more then trouble Creses , not onely because it did in manner destroy his own hopes, that seemed to depend upon the success of the journey he had in hand, which was to present the Princesse Cloria an acceptable offering to her Father, but in denying them all means to avoid a dangerous consequence, since they neither could advance towards their first intention, for doubt of interruption in the passage by scattering Troops of the Senates Garrisons, nor durst retire back again to the Castle for fear of being cruelly punished for the escape: so that he was forced to make the old Father acquainted with the personall presence of the Princess Cloria ; and the rather, since he could no way mistrust his fidelity, but of the contrary by that knowledge, procure a reception of her in his house, until his own return from Philadelphia , whither he intended secretly to go, that he might the better be informed of the Kings condition, and by that direction more conveniently secure the Princess Cloria , either by flight into some forreign Countrey, or deliver her person into the protection of her own Father, as he had promised: yet he conjured the Flamin , after he had laid open unto him his thoughts, intentions, and desires, not to discover the least syllable of these disasterous accidents to the Princess, for fear of disquieting her gentle bosome with misfortunes, no care of hers could remedy; though he determined to perswade her to be contented to dispence with his own absence for some time, to perform pretended necessary services for her saftety. When they had sufficiently digested these resolutions and agreements, they both rose from their seats, to present themselves to Cloria: The Princess at their approach, entertained the Flamine with the same affection she conceived to be due to one, that had been formerly honoured by her Fathers favours; whilst he with tears in his eyes, presently conducted her and the rest of the company to his small habitation; excusing notwithstanding in a courtly phrase, the poorness of the welcome she was to expect: but long she had not enjoyed the pleasing security of that retirement, before she was overtaken with a most horrid and insolent. Treason in this sort. The Souldiers that cowardly were fled from the Battle, as the Flamine had related to Creses , and were retired within the Fortifications of those Woods, for their better security against their pursuers, understanding by some intelligence that the Princess Cloria was lodged privately within the old Fathers house, began to consider, that if they returned her back again to the Senate at Sardis , from whence they understood she was escaped, it would prove so acceptable, that they should not onely thereby purchase all their pardons, but probably many of the chief actors might receive considerable rewards. This opinion they no sooner entertained in their wicked and disloyal breasts, but the execution followed with so much violence, that they not onely seized Cloria and Roxana , but also carried with them the old Flamine , as a full period to their supream villany, notwithstanding all the perswasions could be used towards them: But the Gods hating the Traytours, though the Senate made use of the Treason; all they could procure for this acceptable service, was to have their lives saved, upon condition they should within ten dayes depart the Kingdom; or else, to suffer present death wheresoever they could be found after the limited time, which caused them to curse the very day of their births. However this just sentence was a deserving reward for their offences, yet poor Cloria enjoyed no comfort in her captivity, but rather her crosses were augmented by the arrival of Cassianus: so that one day when she was retired into the innermost part of her lodgings, with an intention to contribute a large proportion to her sorrows, esteeming it the best conversation she could possesse in these sad times, she was of a sudden saluted by the Prince, who conceived his power gave him a sufficient warrant for any intrusion; where, after he had continued his courtship with a few complemenns, he strived to protest his affection, with all the reasons that the same Religion, nearness of kindred, and his vow'd service to her Father could pretend unto; which pluckt from the Princess this sharp and sudden reply, contrary to her nature. Couzen, said she, although your own thoughts can best witness the Religion you hold, yet give me leave to tell you, that my knowledge receives no satisfaction by your profession, since you violently seem to run along with that current, that seeks by all means possible to destroy the Lydian Rights, in taking away the Flamins out of the Temples, the onely pretended occasion now of these Wars, between my father and his Senate; in which Customes I have been brought up from my Cradle. Again, for your blood, I must confess it is of so near kindred with mine, that I wonder you do not blush to see me suffer an injurious captivity, without revenge or assistance; much more, to be a principal cause of my imprisonment, since your preposterous affections addes flames to the Senates cruelty; when as my love in all justice should rather be perswaded then compelled. And lastly, concerning the service you profess to my Father, as I would be glad to see some effects thereof by reall actions, instead of aiery, and perhaps of false professions; so of the other side, I must desire you to remember, that Prince Cassianus was alwayes entertained, and cherished by King Euarchus , with all humanity and bounty, when his regal power was not diminished: wherefore in my opinion, you have no reason to side with that faction, that strives to pluck the Diadem from the brows of him and his posterity; in which number I have, or ought to have a considerable interest. Cassianus , after he had received this bitter reply, with a certain pale, if not guilty look, rested for some time, as it were frozen in a kinde of despair, not being able to utter one syllable in defence of himself, against such desperate language, as he thought delivered by a heavenly Oracle: yet at last, left he might seem altogether conquered by the force of her reasons, when it was impossible her sweet words could wound, but with the darts of Cupid , he fearfully returned this answer, which reached her ears, but not her belief. Madam, said he, for the differences in Religion between your Father and his Senate, I esteem them no way essential; consisting onely, in matter of Ceremony, which with a little labour may easily be reconciled to both their advantages: And for that bloud of yours, that so much honoured my birth, I could wish to have an occasion to let it out from nourishing my heart, whereby to do you the least service; though your release cannot fall within the capacity of my power, since it is the command of the whole Kingdom, that restrains your liberty; nevertheless without any thought of injury intended to your person: for, if I believed the Senate had any determination to diminish, much less to deprive your Royal Father of those Flowers which belong justly to his glorious Crown, I should be so far from countenancing of their endeavours, that I would contend with all difficulties, to tear the remembrance of their intentions from the face of the earth; however, I cannot deny, but I meerly subsist by their extraordinary bounty, since I have lost the possession of mine own Countrey, that should maintain my condition. At which words the Princess with a disdainful smile, gave him a dissembled thanks, accompanied by so sweet and becomming a scorn, that Cassianus seemed more bitten at her silence then by the dispute; though Roxana could not chose but take her Mistresses part, and consequently made this cholorick answer, to that little he had said in his own defence. My Lord, said she, I cannot but wonder if the points in Religion, be of no greater difference then you speak of, that the Senate should disturb the quiet State of Lydia with so much blood and slaughter, to compell Euarchus to change the Government, when it is evident he desires but to maintain the profession of his Father without alteration; nay rather methinks it would have been greater marks of their piety, to have given way to the Kings humour, in so small a thing of consequence, then to have bought the alteration at so dear and dangerous a price. And for the latter part of your discourse, I shall onely put you in minde, that as your Uncles love and bounty never failed you, when he was in a flourishing prosperity, so you may do nobly to pay his actions past, and his necessities present, with testimonies of gratitude and duty. Cassianus although he vowed to the uttermost of his power, he did and would render him his best endeavours, yet he quickly changed the subject of the discourse, pretending that love at the present, was more suitable to his disposition then hate, and therefore began again to court the Princess with fresh complements: however when he found with a neglectful silence, she onely seemed to hear his words, without a will to understand the matter, as if she were less pleased with those smiles, then with the Senates frowns, he abruptly quitted the room, with a kinde of a dark cloud in his looks: within two dayes after this encounter, the old Flamin was brought before the great Senate to receive his trial, not onely for having been in his Court employments a disturber of the State, as 'twas pretended by his ill councel to Euarchus , but at the present for being an instrument, to conveigh the Princess out of the Senates protection, and conceal her person in his house, whereby to marry her to some forreign power, that might endanger the prosperity of Lydia . Which accusations were so spitefully alledged against him, with such prejudicate resolutions for his ruine, that the old man had not force enough, to sustain the weight of the prosecution, though he exprest a competent courage in his defence, and so was condemned publickly to lose his head upon a Scaffold, in the view of all the people, who at leastwise appeared contented, if not pleased at the novelty. But Cloria when she heard of this sudden, and as she conceived, horrid determination, was possessed with a noble compassion, not onely considering the old man to have been a most faithful servant to her Father, but unfortunate by this intended Tragedy, onely for entertaining her at his house, as a testimony of his Loyalty to the Royal Family, which wrought in her gentle soul divers perturbations: First, she considered, that if he suffered, it would be some stain to her honour, since he appeared rather to be a Martyr for her, then for himself; which obligation she was unwilling to undergo, without some testimonies of a supream gratitude; yet then when she reflected upon that submission, she must use to beg his life of the Senate, she thought the sacrifice of an old Flamine , who e're long could not chuse but be an offering to the earth, would not prejudice his own happiness, much less tax her of ill nature; and therefore became half perswaded to let him run his last period with glory, rather then become a suppliant to her Fathers Subjects for mercy: yet after much contestation with her self, the vertuous Princess fell upon this apprehension, that she in a manner became the author of ill, by omitting that good she had power to do, and by that means should deserve the worlds censure: so that pitty, gratitude, and religion seemed to contend with courage, honour, and disdain, till at last she flew to this resolution, to send for Cassianus , and conjure him by the hopes of his desired love, to be so far an intercessour in the poor Flamines behalf, as to preserve him from destruction by his power or interest; though again when she entred into consideration, what a jealous scruple the request might raise in Narcissus thoughts, if ever he should come to know of the action, it almost destroyed the piousness of her intention: nevertheless she called Roxana , and wisht her in her name to fetch Cassianus to speak with her, since her resolutions were not long to be protracted if she had a will they should prove effectual; yet as the old woman was going out of the door to perform her message, she suddenly commanded her back again, labouring as it were in her inconstant constancy, until Roxana her self being displeased with her fruitless irresolutions, at length went without her leave. When Cassianus came, he found the Princesse seated not onely in a dark chamber, but environed with those mourning Curtains about her bed, which she had caused to be hung up since her last imprisonment, as testimonies of the discontented state she conceived her self in: When Roxana had informed her of the Princes presence to attend her pleasure, after she had with a low voice desired him to sit down in a Chair near her, she used this discourse unto him. Cousin, said she, is it possible you can think, that the blood of the poor and aged Flamin may be so acceptable an offering to the Gods, as to make them thereby more propitious to your desires? or do you believe, that my love which you seem to hope for, will be perswaded easily by the cruelty of so horrid a sacrifice? if you mean to threaten instead of intreating, perhaps you may please your own nature, but never I can assure, compel my liking; since I finde in my soul so much courage yet left, notwithstanding all my misfortunes, as not to give away my affections to one that hath merited so much just hate from me. Certainly you are mistaken to think, Cypres Branches are fit Ornaments to become a Marriage Bed, when the many examples in that kinde have been alwayes prodigious: Can you flatter so far your own imagination, as to apprehend the slaughter of my friends, and slaughtered chiefly for my service, can create less effects in me, then a revenge when I shall have power to execute it according to my will, upon those that have occasioned my displeasure? It should be strange they should expect to be entertained in my bosom, that have spightfully procured my disgraceful discontent: No Cousin assure your self, these are not the wayes to captivate a Virgins gentle heart, whereby to trust protestations of such a Suitor, that wanted not hate in the highest professions of his love. Cassianus after he had heard these words from the Princess, hastily without any reply at all took his leave; which not onely gave occasion of many conjectures both to Cloria and Roxana , but also of some discourses, that produced hopes and fears, until within three hours of his departure, he again returned into the Princess Chamber, with a Reprieve for the old mans life, signed by the hands of the Senate; though with this condition, that she must be pleased to follow the direction of the whole Kingdome in her Marriage: however Cassianus vowed by the Heavens, he imployed all his power to have procured it absolute. Cloria notwithstanding she was not well satisfied with the restriction, yet she was pleased with the pardon, and presently sent it by Roxana to the Officers, that had the custody of the old Flamin ; whilst in the mean time she conceived some dissembled satisfaction was necessary for Cassianus , that he might continue still his begun courtesies to the aged Father; and withal to possess him with the knowledge of the impossibilities that hindred the progress of his love, whereby he might be less violent, in pressing the Senate to the accomplishment of his desires: The rather she fell upon this resolution, for that Narcissus absence, secured him from all danger by underhand practises, though her self could not be confident of his safety, since she had heard nothing from him; which consideration at the present, drew from her fair eyes some tears before she used these words to Cassianus . Worthy Cousin, said she, (for so I will now call you, since I finde your words real, and your love noble) if the Gods did give me the possibility of being your Wife, I should a great deal rather, declare my self perswaded to the choice by your own vertues, then by the Senates wisdom, since the interest of Kingdoms is not to be put in the ballance with the unity of affection; the one proceeding onely from forced reasons, that last no longer then the motives have power by the operation of private ends, when the other arising from the secret influence of the Heavens, engraves a perpetual affection in the heart, not to be removed by humane tyranny. Wherefore I say, interests of Crowns cannot contribute any thing to the felicity of Nuptials, however sometimes they pretend false shews to cover hidden discontents, and so by that means couzens the world into a belief, of what the married couple never enjoy; of the contrary enduring millions of concealed torments, that are increased in violence, when they burst forth like imprisoned flames, which by accidents procure their own liberty: Therefore I say, nay I will boldly profest the undergoing the punishment of a thousand deaths, before I be ever compelled to marry by the prescription of earthly respects, much less be commanded to take any for my Husband, that hath not really perswaded my judgement, or absolutely wrought upon my fancy: Let it suffice your perfections, carry with them more powerfulness in my consideration, then the Senates desires do weight in my understanding, though I should be sorry to chuse rashly, or to be guided wholly by mine own opinions; which is enough to let you see that my unconquered, and I hope pure love cannot be constrained, although my dear life pay the ransom of my seeming wilfulness; for though tyranny may shut up my weak body within strong Walls, until the just Gods punish the wickedness, yet my resolved soul will be free to make election of death, or life, as the occasion shall be presented; so that as your actions have changed already my belief of your intentions, do not again change your actions, that I become of another minde, wherein you will but lose honour instead of gaining love; and that loss perhaps may make you uncapable of all other fortunes: It is enough, I value your blood, I esteem your person, and love your vertues; however I cannot be yours in possession as long as Narcissus lives: with those words wept again, as at her former apprehensions of his safety, which continued her in a silence, until Cassianus reply gave her thoughts new matter to work upon. Madam, said he, as I cannot but be perswaded, though unwillingly by your powerful and excellent Rhetorick, yet give me leave to tell you, that I understand not your conclusion, since you have been pleased to say in your discourse, that as long as Narcissus lives you cannot be mine; a choice I must confess, that the Gods have never to this hour revealed unto me, since at my leaving of Lydia , a match of a far greater Dignity in Titles, seemed to be the obstacle that destroyed my hopes, and so consequently all motions I could make of my secret love: But however, if my ears have not much deceived my knowledge, I have heard it generally reported, that some accident many moneths since, hath deprived Narcissus not onely of the share you pretend he hath in your affection, but also of all the claim he can expect in this world. If it have, said Cloria , your pretensions are the nearer; and with that fell a weeping again so bitterly, that Cassianus could not chuse but accompany her in her grief: But after some time that his thoughts had liberty to enter into consideration, both of the Princesses words and of his own concernment, scarce yet believing her relation, he told her, that he had no reason to claim the interest of another; yet if Narcissus were dead, he hoped his love and service should expect the next place in her affection: And with that parted from her, with an intention to make a more particular enquiry, into the truth of the intelligence, which afforded the Princess a kinde of a calm for the present, that contented her thoughts for some moneths. And this calm having made her discontents something tollerable, she was perswaded one afternoon by her Governess, to take some little delight or recreation, in a green Meadow within the limits of her imprisonment, that usually was not frequented by strangers, where a River in the midst divided the Field by a seeming equal arbitration; which afforded a kinde of a sad entertainment to the Princess, whilst Roxana was perswaded also by her many solicitous thoughts, to search out solitary walks in the neighbouring Woods, for the exercise of her contemplation: To this purpose Cloria sitting down by the Brook side, supporting in the interim her fair cheeks by her white hand, whilst her knee underpropped both, as a rich foundation that nature had created, for the establishment of a most noble building, her fancy was carried as it were with a stedfast melancholly to behold the running stream, that represented to her troubled imagination, her own inconstant fate, that had formerly afforded her some moments of happiness, in the conversation of her dear Narcissus , whom now she was not sure ever to enjoy again, which by a quick course seemed to hasten to the Sea, to be drowned in that vast confusion, as her past delight was buried in her Fathers misfortunes and her own. And as she was sending also her tears along with the course of the River in the main Ocean, to be confounded in the multitude of those rude Waters, of a sudden she saw a Pilgrim to traverse the Meadow, as if his ignorance in those parts had rendred him altogether unskilful in the wayes: But the Princess being yet fuller of charity then sorrow, dispenced for the present with her grief, to give him some instruction; and to that purpose calling him to her, began to question with him about his name and business: The Pilgrim in a kinde of amazed reply told her, that as his name scarce deserved any remembrance, amongst those that enjoyed happy conditions, by reason of his many misfortunes, so for his business, he should be loath to impart it to any, before it did reach the ears of the Princess Cloria , to whom it was directed, whose abode as he was informed was not far off that place. Truly, answered the Princess, if you mean that happy condition by my self, you are as much mistaken in your opinion as you were in your way; however perhaps I may prove so fortunate to your intention, as to help you to the speech of that Lady you mention, although I must tell you, this passage is not open to all travellers, being onely kept for the Princess private recreation, and such company as are confined with her in the Castle: At which words the poor Pilgrim fell upon his knees to ask pardon for his fault, though he protested he was altogether ignorant, that any prohibition had forwarned passage into those private walks, reserved for the Princess pleasure; however his journey into Lydia was chiefly intended to her presence. The Princess quickly commanded to him to rise, assuring him, that as the limitation of those Fields did not belong wholly to her jurisdiction, she being her self a prisoner also under authority, so if she were an absolute commandress (as he did imagine), she was so well acquainted with the reverence due to his sacred habit, that his free absolution would soon have been procured at her hands. At which words the Pilgrim began to weep, and notwithstanding her earnest intreaty, would by no means rise from the ground where he kneeled, which made Cloria wonder, though not more at the business then at his passionate carriage. Wherefore after some few circumstances, finding no importunity of hers was able to remove him from his settled humility, she told him, she was the Lady to whom the intention of his travels was directed. When the Pilgrim had received this information, he beseeched her anew to pardon his rude errour, since as he said, being lately come out of Syria , he could not be informed of the dignity of her person, not having any attendants about her to instruct his knowledge; and then wept again, as if his business had been nothing else, but meer expressions of sorrow; until at last having wiped his eyes with a Handkerchief hanging at his Girdle, he entertained the Princess with this language. Most vertuous Princess, said he, be pleased to know, that it was my fortune to be in the City of Tyre , when young Narcissus was brought into the Town mortally wounded, by a Ship of the same Town, where by the courtesie of the Captain, he was soon provided of convenient lodgings for his repose, and an assembly desired of the best Physicians of the place for his cure, although his name and condition was concealed from all, but those that had conveighed him thither: Thus he remained with some hopes, but more doubts for many weeks of his recovery, until at last a dangerous Feavor made every one in the house despair of his safety: Amongst which number it was my chance to be preparing my self for a Voyage to Delphos , according to a serious vow I had made to the Gods for the expiation of certain offences. But he understanding of my intention, and conceiving my best way would be to pass by the Kingdom of Lydia in the journey, one day when the violence of his sickness, gave him some more ease then accustomed, and that the Chamher by hazzard was freed from all company but my self, by reason of a certain Holy day near the Town, he desired me to approach his Bed-side, where after I was seated, and that by many sighs, he had made me acquainted with your unfortunate loves, and his own condition, he conjured me by all the charity that ought to accompany my thoughts in so sacred a journey, that in my passage I would visit you in Lydia , where he understood you were newly arrived: And not onely declare unto you, all the circumstances of his untimely death, with the assurance of his most constant love to his last end, but withal obliged me to deliver this Ring, which he said was the dear testimony of the contract, that had been between you; and presently putting his hand in his bosom, drew out a paper, wherein was contained that unwelcome token. When Cloria beheld the pledge of their unfortunate loves, now ended in the worst of periods, she looked upon it as if she expected a miraculous remedy, or a miserable distraction; till at last, conquered by the very depth of her desperate imagination, she became exceeding pale, and scarce was so for any time, before a more earthly colour, by little and little seemed to change that yet lovely white, which death it self a great while had no power to overcome. But alas the procession was too wilfull, for not long after, he dainty though weak legs, not being able to support the weight of her fair body, since her pure soul could contribute no assistance, she sunk down to the ground, like a rich marble statue built upon snowy bases: which caused the poor Pilgrim, with a haste composed of an amazed sorrow, and a desperate fear, to flye to her relief; cursing not onely his relation, but his very journey that occasioned it: but his violent execrations, had not power to breathe the least shew of life into her sweet body, as if the Gods were resolved, to keep possession of so heavenly a spirit, (notwithstanding he continued the rubbing of her Temples with more then ordinary passion) until he spake in her ears, that Narcissus was not dead, but falsly so alledged by his malicious and wicked tongue; and for a testimony of his last affirmations, (which he wisht might be confirmed by his perpetual torment, as a punishment for his offence) he suddenly pulled off that deceitful Beard, that had so unluckily disguised his person from her knowledge. Cloria after she had for some time continued in her sad sleep, that fain would gently have sent her without noise to a better habitation, she softly again opened her eyes, that seemed something eclipsed of their former brightness, and fixing them upon that object, that onely had power to keep them from entertaining an eternal darkness, she used these low words: And is it possible that Narcissus still lives? or is it my flattering fancy that ever couzens me into new miseries? then shut them again, as if either yet she was not absolutely perswaded of his truth, or had a minde to reprove him for his unkinde concealing of himself: But Roxana's arrival, both afforded Cloria more remedy, and proved a means to beg Narcissus pardon, who was not able by any Rhetorick, to excuse the sin he had committed, against the Laws of Love, in borrowing a disguised shape, to hide that which Cloria had onely a desire to see: However Lovers quarrels although they are violent, yet never or very seldom are lasting; beside the sweet Princess had no room left in her bosom for revenge, where there was already inspired so much joy; so that in a short time, a perfect truce was not onely made between them, though chiefly exprest in contemplation, wherein their hearts spake more then their lips; but after they had seemed sufficiently to have surfeited of their joy, Narcissus was perswaded to make a perfect relation of his own adventures: Wherefore taking her fair hand, and gently kissing it twice or thrice, as a sworn testimony of the truth of his story, he began in this manner, whilst in the mean time the poor Princess, read a lecture in his looks, that appeared amply to instruct her thoughts. Most sweet Princess, said he, as I know not what accident, or rather I may call it a fate, separated our Ships one from another coming from Egypt , so no sooner were we out of sight of your Vessel, but the Winds, as if they intended again to remember us of a meeting, though they seemed to deny the opportunity, began most furiously to rage upon the waters; insomuch, as being tost from one billow to another, with a kinde of a rude uncertainty, we became at last in a manner desperate of our own safeties: But then O you Gods, how were my thoughts transported in your behalf, knowing you to be in the same condition of danger and hazzard? how many lives would I have willingly sacrificed of my own, with what torments soever, but to have rendred you secure in my own thoughts, in some haven or harbour of quietness, free from the inconstant cruelty of the Winds, and raging Tempest that appeared rebellious to all our wishes? what infinite dammages did I conceive the whole world would sustain by your loss, since with you went away all vertue, honour, and beauty from the face of the earth? sometimes I would call the Marriners from their necessary imployments, as to ask their opinions concerning your danger and condition, whilst they, barbarous and ignorant wretches, rather minded their own present affairs, then gave me any satisfactory reply, as if they understood not the consequence of my demand, but rather amazedly preferred their own safety, before those thoughts appertaining to your particular; which caused me equally to bestow both curses and prayers in your behalf: The Princess finding Narcissus in some sort transported with these imaginations, whereby probably, she should be delayed from hearing the story of his adventures, with a pretty kinde of jeering smile, wisht him to leave off now any more care for her particular, since as she said, he found her safe, and rather follow that relation she expected from him, as a more necessary duty for the present; this made him quickly fall to his task with fewer circumstances then formerly, in this manner. A night and a day, said he, having kept us upon the Seas in this Storm, at last the Skie cleared it self from its cloudy incumberance, which made us perceive, that we were near the Island of Rhodes : Wherefore finding our Ship was much beaten with the Tempest, and most of our company unable to undergo a farther journey without some refreshment, I gave my consent to have the Vessel put into the Haven; the rather because I hoped to hear some news of your safety in that City. The chief Commander of that Island for the present, is a great Nobleman of Lydia , who however, he keeps a certain correspondency with the Senate for his own more convenient security, yet in his heart he is an entire servant to the King your Father; which not onely made me think my welcome so much the better in his Countrey, but his Wife being my most near Kinswoman, I was perswaded to make my abode for some few dayes in that place, whilft in the interim we sent out many small Vessels, to enquire after your condition: But however I could have been very well content, to have remained there longer, in regard of the vertuous and noble entertainment both of the Lord and Lady; yet upon the Messengers return, finding no advertisement could be given concerning your particular. with a certain kinde of melancholly rage, I retired into my Chamber, where I continued, notwithstanding any perswasion to the contrary, until another Ship was fitted for our transportation, in regard ours was held for the present, altogether uncapable of another voyage, without a great deal of mending and reparation: Within two or three dayes I took my leave of my Kinswoman, and her Lord; though the Gods knew in a very blunt manner, (my thoughts being overburthened for complements) and presently directed my course to the Island of Cyprus , where I hoped you were; or at leastwise by my coming thither would be arrived; notwithstanding I could not in my fearful apprehension but doubt the worst, though those in the Ship, endeavoured by many circumstances, to confirm me in a certain belief of your safety, which made the journey something less tedious and distasteful: I conjured nevertheless the whole company entirely to conceal my name, from any person whatsoever until you were found: But when we landed at Salamine , I understood the Queen your Mother and my Father, were both lately removed from thence to Paphos ; where again strictly enquiring after you, and not hearing any news whatsoever, either of your abode or safety, after I had spent some time in tearing my hair, and using other fruitless complaints, I resolved in a disguise, to seek you out in the Countrey of Pamphylia ; whither very probably I conceited the winds, and the storm might have driven your Ship; and by that means have committed your person to a new imprisonment, since that Territory is known to belong unto the King of Egypt: To this purpose having changed my habit (being onely accompanied by a few of my attendants I could best trust) we put Egyptian Colours upon the top of our Vessel, as if we had onely belonged to the principality of Pamphylia: Thus we sailed with all possible speed towards the Confines of the lesser Asia , in regard we understood by certain Merchants of Syria remaining in Salamine , no news had been heard of you in that Kingdom, since your departure from the City of Memphis . The Gods perhaps intending by this diversion, to bring about other purposes, according to their divine and inscrutable decrees, before we approached the Shore of Pamphylia by some hours sail, we were suddenly set upon by two Vessels of Tyre , and presently commanded to yield our persons to their power and dispose, without dispute or contradiction, unless we would hazzard our selves, in a contention most dangerous and desperate. This language meeting my discontents and despair, caused me to make a greater resistance, then was either convenient or necessary for our welfare, until at last being wounded in many parts of my body, and not a few of the company slain or hurt, our Ship was not onely seized upon, but my self carried to the Castle of the Town, where an Officer belonging to Philos commanded me to custody, for that Philos was for the present gone to Damascus: Within three dayes Philos returned from Court, and not long after coming to my Chamber, he quickly knew who I was, so bestowing upon me some few complements (I desiring him in the interim to conceal my name and quality) he presently gave order, for my respectful attendance and necessary cure: Also he appointed me to be removed to the best lodgings in his Castle, with a promise absolutely not to discover my person to any, but his own Sister Artemesia , who, as he said to his knowledge, would contribute her best assistance to my recovery: In this condition (though extreamly afflicted inwardly by reason of your self) I remained for at least a weeks space; when again one day Philos came and seated himself by my Bed- side, telling me after some few complements, that as his Sister had provided such rare simples for the practise of my Physicians, as could not otherwise be procured, by all the power and art of the great and rich Kingdom of Syria ; so was she resolved shortly in person, to give me a visit, if not daily accompany me in my distempers, when I should be rendred as he said more proper for the conversation of Ladies: Then he made me exactly tell him, the story or manner of our unfortunate separation at Sea; seeming extraordinary inquisitive, as well in what posture I left you at parting, as what my opinion was concerning your safety: Although this relation with so many particulars, brought to my remembrance by the discourse, encreased my torments, like so many sharp daggers piercing my heart, with a thousand mortal wounds, yet I could not well deny the civility, in regard that I was not onely in the Countrey of Syria , where I knew it would have been held a kinde of a rude barbarisme in conversation, not to comply in all discourses whatsoever, notwithstanding any discontent or passion, but that for the present, I seemed to be also entertained with the best expressions of love and kindness, could be imagined in his house: After I had made answer, to what he could possible require at my hands in that nature, I both desired and conjured him, to send speedily what Ships he could spare out of his Harbours, to enquire after your welfare and abode: Which being promised (some of the Physicians at the same time coming into the room) he necessarily left me to their dispose and directions. As I began to recover my health, I became every day more then other perswaded, and satisfied concerning the certain hopes of your safety, in regard we could not hear of any shipwracks, that hath hapned upon any of those coasts, or Seas near Syria, Pamphylia , or Cyprus , how diligent soever the Messengers had been in their enquiry; which in a short time so mended my condition, if not repaired my disability, that oftentimes I was not onely able, but prescribed to walk into the Garden, and other places of pleasure for my better recreation: And this was an occasion, that one afternoon, I was sent for by the Lady Artemesia, (Philos being for the present somewhere out of the way, attending upon his necessary occasions;) at my arrival, I found the Lady her self seated at the upper end of the room, with a Sampler in her hand, and a waiting-woman attending by her, that furnished her with those Silks she had occasion to use; however at my approach she rose up, to give me a respectful salutation, and that drew from me some complements, in regard of the dainty work she had designed, which in truth appeared excellent to my apprehension, being onely the pretty banquet of the Gods, where Juno swell'd with overmuch jealousie, because Ganymed was so near her Husband: But that which pleased most my opinion, was to see the angry looks of Cupid , because his Mother courted her deformed Vulcan in such an assembly; whilst Mars appeared to be out of countenance at the action. After I had not onely viewed, but commended the artificial hand, that had so lively described the delightful story, Artemesia made me this reply; that it was no wonder, if humane creatures were given so much to love, when the very Gods themselves were troubled with those passions. Truly Madam, said I, although I cannot but allow of the passion, when it is ordained to produce onely noble effects, yet certainly the Gods, could never be subject to those imperfections, when for the most part their flames were unlawful, as other preventing of other mens loves, or destroying the chastity of Virgins, as the Poets mention. For my part, said she, I am of opinion, although most of their actions described by the wandring fancies of Poets, were but meer fictions, yet it cannot be but the stories of Perseus and Hercules , both sons to Jupiter were true, and consequently do shew to our example, the lawfulness of the passion, when such Heroes were produced, the one of a married Wife, the other of a Maid, to free the world from oppression and injury, since they appeared busied in no other imployment, who for their excellent qualities and justice, have been since esteemed Gods. This discourse I must confess coming from a Virgin, did something amaze me; yet we continued our disputation, until the time of the day, and Philos coming into the room, prevented any further contention, in a subject I as much delighted in as her self. At which expression the sweet Princess smiled, as if some cause had been given her of jealousie; however she told him, although his story began to be suspicious, yet she had so much justice in her resolution, as to attend the end of his discourse, hoping that his relation at last would clear all difficulties. But by my honesty, Madam, said Roxana , you will perchance be deceived in your confidence, when you may be sure, he will never accuse himself, what fault soever he hath committed privately; which words proceeded so sharply from the old womans delivery, that it might be easily conjectured, that in her youth she had been sometimes couzened in her love; or at leastwise was of that opinion: Nevertheless Cloria bid Narcissus go on, protesting she would not do that wrong to her own innocent and noble thoughts, as to suspect him whom she had in her judgement esteemed worthy of her affections: At which declaration, the poor Pilgrim seemed to be transported with a new joy; and after he had given her humble thanks for the confidence she had of his vertues, that became increased by that opinion, he took her white hand again, upon which he imprinted a multitude of vows, able to drive jealousie out of the world, and then proceeded in this manner. But this interruption, as I said, not onely put off the exercising of my wit, and perhaps Artemesia's intention, but also carried us all to supper, where many looks of the young Lady to invite my eyes to the like encounter, gave my thoughts more then enough suspicion, and so consequently my minde a great deal of trouble all the night following; until the morning brought into my Chamber an old woman, whom I had often seen in those visits her Mistriss had bestowed upon me in my sickness, and boldly seating her self upon my Bed, abruptly used these words. Of all the men in the world, said she, I wonder at your stupidity, since your youth and beauty should be such flames to love, rather to consume your quiet rest, then coldly thus to entertain the more then offered affections of another Venus , whose perfections are onely subjects of admiration. Is it possible that so bright a star as Artemesia , hath not a powerful influence in your dull soul? When the earth seems to tremble at the greatness of her Uncle, which renders all people in a manner willing to become his slaves, whilst you appear loath to be his friend. Can you think these frequent visits, that this fair and great Lady made to you in your sickness, and since her free conversation, proceed from ordinary respects, when the greatest Princes in Asia are not thought worthy of the favours, without coming clothed with the pretensions of being her Husband; and alas, who can be esteemed so happy, as to merit such a Title, however far above you in dignity; though I could wish she had chosen long ago, to have prevented her unhappy fate, by casting her eyes and heart upon such a subject: If you do not yet understand this old Philosophy, at leastwise believe the new Logick I deliver, that am her nurse; and consequently should know her minde. Let it suffice, if you lift you may be happy beyond Kings; but if your perverse fortune, intend you not such a blessing, certainly no less a curse then destruction will accompany the disaster; since there is no mean to be expected, between possession in love or ruine by hate; and after some time left me, to be accompanied onely by my own imagination, which soon represented unto me these considerations. First the dangerous consequence of being in the custody of Artemesia's Brother, who had the commodity as well to destroy as to speak the word; and next the rage of the whole family, if they should conceive themselves dishonoured by the refusal. Yet dear Cloria , said he, my not to be conquered loyalty to you, was sufficient to resist, though not to prevent all difficulties. At which expression, the Princess onely with another pretty smile, bid him go on in his story: But the first, said he, most troubled my thoughts, since Philos love to his Sister as I believed, would easily be perswaded by my death, to make a greater distance between our affections, when he should finde my constancy could not be removed by his milder art, rather then hazzard Artemesia's honour: For the second, although I supposed the whole family, would hold it for a supream indignity, to have their Kinswoman refused by my neglect, yet the revenge could not well be executed, without the discovery of the Ladies passion: But I resolved as my best defence, neither to take notice of the old womans discourse, nor of her Mistrisses courtship, until I were yet prest by some new overture, not to be waved without a peremptory reply, and then to shew my courage in our loves, since the Ladies passions, I supposed would not break out to any dangerous violence, until she became absolutely desperate in her hopes. After I had drest my self, and was entertaining my thoughts in a retiring place belonging to my lodging, I became suddenly invited by a Messenger sent by Philos , to accompany him to a certain place belonging to his Uncle Philostros , not above four hours voyage in a Coach, where the great favourite had imployed abundance of wealth, with more industry, to render it an habitation both curious and stately, as being the place not onely of his birth, but bearing the name of his family. The first object that presented it self to our eyes, was a beautiful Town, though more in the quality then in the quantity of the houses, built in such a just uniformity, that it became a question to my imagination, whether the order or the materials, should have the greates preheminence in my opinion; since the one in a pleasant prospective pleased the sight, as the other in a mature consideration satisfied the understanding: For as Cypres Trees being mixt with the several buildings, afforded a most delightful variety, so the richness of the stone shewed it was designed to be lasting; both which being joyned together, the whole could not chuse but be admirable; insomuch as I had much adoe, to get my looks off those rarities, until greater wonders appeared ready to entertain me; which was the Palace it self seated in a convenient ascent, built all of Tuscan work, with such exact skill, that the Architectures of the wonders of the world, might have been present at the design: It was framed into a perfect square, each angle supported by a goodly Pavilion , elevating their guilded heads above the rest of the Fabrick, whilst two Galleries of either side joyned by a portal of severall coloured Marble, inclosed in a large Court, that onely at the further end made a brave Tarras, paved artificially with Moysayick work, and bounded by rail and baller of Corinthian Brass, whereupon both sides of the stairs upon double pedestals of Porphir , were placed the two Statues of Saturn and Jupiter . The outward Court round about the Walls, seemed to be crowned with Urns, mixt with half statues of the ancient Grecians, whilst the entrance being open at the top, the architrave freeze and cornish, were cut off in the middle, and finished with Cartooses instead of meeting. The gate of either part was supported by Ionick Pillars, two behinde and one before, which made a return in the building; and four guilded Lions upon low pedestals seemed to guard the passage. After we had traversed these beautiful inclosures, we were let into the Gardens, for the more conveniency of shade, since the day already began to be enflamed by the Suns violence, which for the more curiosity were ordered into several discents, supported by huge Arches of white Marble; and in many places so covered with excellent Fruit Trees, that they seemed afar off, to be painted over with delightful Landskips of Woods, whilst the Birds and Water-works inclosed in the Vaults, sent forth a pleasing murmur to the air. The first Garden although it were less then all the rest, because it might afford a better prospect upon the other, was divided into four squares, each containing a magnificent fountain, the one having the brazen statue of Hercules with his Club in his hand, invironed about with a Christal lake, wherein were Fishes so gentle by education, that they waited in the water, to be fed by those that viewed the curiosities. The superfice of the pond was formed into twelve Angles, and raised three foot high by a certain calle of cut stone, that resembled a hedge, whereupon each point was put, one of his labours artificially cast in mettle. The second water work, represented the naked figures of Diana and her Nymphs in white Marble; however so shadowed by a dainty grove planted by art for that purpose, that their whole shapes could not perfectly be discovered, though there appeared enough for delight and admiration; whilst poor Acteon without the Trees in a green plat of ground, seemed to be torn in pieces by his own Hounds, according to the judgement given against him, by the revengeful Goddess, though his friends in every place out of the bushes, appeared to haste to his rescue The third fountain was onely of Perimus and Thisbe, with the tragical event of their loves. And the last figured the fates of Hero and Leander, where her Tower being built in a certain other lake, which received its current from the first, made a kinde of confused, though little Sea, wherein the campassionate Nymphs by exact expressions, were apprehended to bewail the lovely youths death, whilst his distracted love, cast her self from the battlements of her own lodgings, to accompany him in his burial. But that which most delighted my senses (because it afforded a pleasing prospective, between divers rows of even set Trees) was a certain Banquetting-house afar off, built after the form of a round Temple, with large windows of bright glass, divided by guilded pillars; notwithstanding it had a portal, to give it entrance, of many transparent columns, or at leastwise they so appeared to my view at a distance: The materials that built it, were yellow minerals, enterlaced with shells of mother of Pearl, so that the structure resembled a Tower of Gold garnished with Jewels; and being sheltred over head, in every place but before, by united Cypresses, it represented to my imagination, a rich Tabernacle in a stately Pavillion; since the Trees were so tall, that they gave it rather a shady lustre, then a dark coverture. Scarce had I contemplated this pleasant object, but that Philos invited me to a nearer taste of the beauty, it being to be past over by a Bridge silver'd over, since the house it self was seated in an Island made by the winding course of a natural River, though many artificial streams from it, seemed to contribute some assistance to the running Brook. At our arrival (having spent a quarter of an hours time, in descending the several sorts of stairs, that carried us into the lower Gardens) we might encounter with our eyes, at the first opening of the door, the Lady Artemesia , newly come out of the water, scarce having covered her modesty with a Lawn Smock; neither did our surprisal, seem to hasten the accommodation of that light coverture, to the best advantage, as if she were so far from being ashamed to be taken in that posture, that she rather exprest a desire to have her beauties still seen: Her hair was at full length, though curiously curled; which pretended to design, and not to accident, since two waiting- woman in Nymphs attire, held a great Looking glass before her, whilst she carefully drest her face with certain black patches, cut into the forms of Flies, and other small creatures, for the better ornament of her looks: Her legs were bare, onely she wore upon her feet a pair of rich embroidered pantobles. This as near as I can remember, was the state we found her in: And very near certainly you were, said Cloria , that you could discover so much. At which words Narcissus began to blush; protesting also with a pretty violence, that he was so far from liking her in that posture, that he was as much displeased as ashamed at her immodesty. Well, well, replied the Princess, go on in your story, without these impertinencies, since none layes any fault to your charge; which command was too peremptory from his fair Mistriss to continue him in any longer disputation: So he proceeded. But however, said he, although she put on no bashful amazement in her countenance, yet with a disdainful frown she seemed to entertain our company, which was a sufficient injunction to cause us speedily to retire; and that gave occasion to Philos (since we had already travelled enough over those walks) to command us to be conducted up into the house, where we might be more conveniently shaded from the heat of the day; and that quickly brought us into the Galleries, where excellent Pictures, not enough to be esteemed, and rich Cabinets beyond valuation, gave our thoughts and eyes an abundance of employments, until a delicious dinner called us into another room, where we found Artemesia , scarce seeming to be the same woman we left her in the Garden; having not onely put off altogether her choller, but also being trimmed up with so exquisite a neatness, as if she had been prepared for her Nuptial Feast; which confirms my opinion, that all those postures were designed of purpose, to make me think she was admirable in every shape, as well when nature plaid the careless wanton, as when art became the curious painter. But in conclusion, a few Complements set us all at table, where lovely Pages like Ganymeds fill'd our Wine rather in Diamond then Christal Glasses, whilst our Fruit seemed to be fetcht from the Hesperides, all so excellent, that could not be imitated, much less equalled; yet that excellency was elevated, I will not say augmented by ravishing Musick, both of voices and instruments, that with a gentle harmony, rather bewitched then burthened the ear; which continued until direction was given to take away the cloth, that the room might be emptied of all Attendants, to give us the greater liberty for our private conversation; a custom in that Country for the better recreation, since they used not to remove presently after dinner: however we all continued for some time in a perfect silence, they perhaps expecting what I should say of my noble entertainment, and their Uncles greatness; and I not being overwilling to administer occasion of discourse, till at last Philos himself brake out in this manner. Sister, said he, although I must confess we have largely tasted of your bounty, though more of your neat curiosity, a property I must acknowledge, that better becomes youthful Ladies; yet it should seem before dinner, you were too carelesse of your retiredness, in suffering strangers to be eye- witnesses of those beauties, which you have designed onely for him that is to be your husband; as rich Jewels that are to be lockt up in close Cabinets, not to be exposed to the vulgar view. Brother, answered Artemesia , with a spriteful haste, although it be true that it was contrary to the intention of my innocent modesty, in that posture to be surprized by your wandring intention; yet certainly I am less ashamed of the accident, when I consider you beheld nothing, that either I may be deprived of, or easily can be equalled by other Ladies of my years; onely all the fear I have is, lest the scandal may prove offensive to this worthy stranger, that I have so great ambition to content, that I should beshrew any occasion that might render me suspected in his opinion, since the interest of my blood and conversation I know, must alwayes keep me safe in yours. I must confess this complement, or rather strange expression of Artemesia , put me in some confusion; considering of one side, if I gave her no answer at all, it might be interpreted an ungrateful rudeness, having received such exquisite entertainment, pretended onely for my divertizement, after my long sickness; and of the other part, what reply soever I could make, proceeding from accustomed rules of civility, would of necessity engage my words to the acknowledgement of her perfections, which might encourage some other passionate progress of that love I so much disliked: However, at last I fell upon this resolution, to involve my answer into such a Riddle, that either could not be well understood, or being so, it might imply a double sense, which I delivered in this fort: Madam, said I, your beauties resemble the innocency of the first ages, that thought vertues were not to be hid from the ignorant world, nor imperfections to be masked by any art, whereby the rude multitude might alwayes have books open, to learn knowledge, and practice goodness, which was the best way to avoid ill, when naked truth was the onely written character for their instructions. This reply, although it did not for the present well satisfie, because it seemed not to flame by the stroke of the flint, that had produced sparkles, as they believed, to set on fire the youthful tinder of my heart; yet of the other side, it left not an absolute despair in their opinions, that at last I might be warned by their motions! nevertheless for that time the coldness of my answer changed the subject of our discourse, to other talk that I confess I approved of; which with many varieties, continued us until the evening warned us to depart, and brought us to our old habitation; where at our arrival, we found a messenger newly come from Damascus , attending to certifie Philos , that his great Uncle Philostros was taken suddenly with a dangerous sickness; insomuch as many of his Physicians very much doubted of his recovery: But however he concealed the news from all the house, yet the next morning very early, it caused him to take his journey, leaving me in the interim onely to be accompanied by his gallant sister; who having the reins absolutely in her own hands, let her passions run with a full career; for finding that all these trials had not wrought at all upon my affection, or got the least ground of my constancy, since the burning coals brought by Cupids diligence from his mothers luxurious Altars, had not yet thaw'd my icie thoughts, Artemesia fell to work new stratagems; so that one morning, I being in a private Library belonging to my lodgings, where commonly I spent some hours in the day, in conferring with those books I most desired to read, and viewing the Maps of several Countreys for my recreation; of a sudden I might hear the doleful voice of a certain person; divided from my knowledge by a partition wall at the end of the room, which quickly made me curious enough to be informed of the nature of the complaint; wherefore approaching nearer, and leaning my head close to the division, I became instantly satisfied, that the noise proceeded from no other then from Artemesia , which did not a little increase my wonder, since I conceived her much beyond all misfortune; however I was resolved to be fully instructed, and to that purpose settling mine ears to an entire attentiveness, in distinct words I heard this language. O unhappy Artemesia , said she, is it possible that thy own beauty is of so poor a value, that it hath not the power to attract the least regard from a youthful eye, which hath been accustomed heretofore, to inflame all the hearts of Syria? Or is thy Uncles dignity fallen in the estimation of all the world, since a stranger in thy power as a prisoner contemns both? O you Gods of Love and Honour, said she, permit not our Family to be so disgraced, though you be determined I shall perish; for since I cannot perswade him I must hate my self, and by consequence become a destroyer of us both: as I am resolved not to breathe onely to suffer, so must not he live chiefly to triumph; with much other goodly stuff of this nature, which I leave to repeat, because I will not prophane your most chaste ears, with all the particulars of her violent and ridiculous passion; however I was forced to dwell with my consideration upon two points in her mad expression: the first was, that she seemed to declare me a prisoner, which until then I never understood; though I must confess, I found my liberty oftentimes restrained under the pretence of a loving care of my health: And the other that appeared more terrible, her seeming resolution, either to enjoy or to destroy; which made me when I had heard enough to retire to my own chamber: but many dayes I had not continued there, before I perceived by the apparent neglect of the whole house, Artemesia not sending for me according to her custome that I was held for no other then a prisoner, being every night locked into my lodging by an officious Groom. All which was done as I understood, to bring down my proud and icie heart, to comply with her desires; her nurse in the interim giving me many items of her intention: besides, I might behold every day out of my chamber window, the rich and glorious triumphs of my insolent Mistress, when she mounted her Chariot to take the air for her recreation, or performed some other visits for her pleasure. And that the splendor might more appear to my thoughts, as intended affronts, contemning my low condition and captivity, she caused an ordinary way to be made by my door, where she daily past with mirth in her countenance, and scorn-in her language; to shew she had not onely forgot her old love, but the very remembrance I was in the house; whilst in the mean time the foresaid Nurse would now and then give me a visit, as it were covertly out of pitty, to comfort up my thoughts against her Ladies rigour; however I very well knew her intention was but the better to discover my resolutions: nevertheless, with all which humours I was content to play, to avoid any further incumbrance of her Mistress offered affection, not doubting but at her brothers return, I should be able to procure my releasement, the onely happiness I aimed at, though my endeavours were not of force to prevent this following mischief: for Artemesia finding that no artifice could make me entertain her love; or adore her person, since the Heavens knew I had a brighter Deity to worship, which kept me from all superstitious Idolatry, began to be enamoured with her own revenge, and so resolved to make me become a Martyr before my time: wherefore one day coming into my chamber when I least looked for her company, her own pride as I thought having forbid her entrance, bearing in her hand a short dagger, as in her countenance a rough tempest, saluted me with this desperate language: Villain, said she, doest thou think to carry the Trophies of my dishonour into thy own Countrey, to adorn the Chariot of thy Mistresses triumphs, with those spoils thy disdain hath purchased in this Castle, to the disgrace of our whole family? And with that struck at my naked breast, being newly unbuttoned by reason of the heat of the weather, with such a womans violence, that I must confess, my quick prevention had fortune enough to avoid the danger of the stroak, though not so much power as to hinder her rage, for finding I had not onely defended my self against her intended and malicious fury, but endeavoured to become an absolute conquerour over her mad passion, by striving to dispossess her also of her weapon, with a spleen more infernal then humane, because she could not hurt me, she resolved to wound her self, whereby I might be esteemed the greater criminal, to take off that blemish which hung upon her reputation by her too violent love; but the stroak proved more deadly then perhaps she imagined, for it not onely pierced her arm, where she onely intended it, but by reason of the sharpness of the point, entred a great depth into her naked side, which with the effusion of a great deal of blood (that at last called up most part of the house to her assistance) left her dead in the view of all the spectators. This sad disaster, as you may imagine, sufficiently enraged the whole company, and conceiving me either the actor, or the instrument of the Tragedy, with all violence haled me to a closer prison in the Castle, whilst according to the custom of those parts, my process was to be made the next morning by the Justice of the Town, before the body could either be buried or imbalmed. This accident gave my confused thoughts sufficient employment; however I made a great question whether I should confess my name, or conceal my condition, finding by my citation, I was onely called the ungrateful stranger, which gave me some opinion, that my quality was not generally known in the City; believing as the one would not at all help to lessen the crime pretended aginst me, but rather give the more suspition of a hidden design, in that I durst attempt a murther of that horrid nature, which an ordinary person would never have performed; so the other might in some sort help to hide the shame to our Family, in being called to a publick defence in a case of such a wickedness: wherefore I determined not to reveal my self, until some apparent necessity procured it. At my arraignment, there was alledged against me, besides the breach of the rules of hospitality, how that it was impossible any other could commit the murther, since Artemesia was found alone with me in my chamber; and it was not to be supposed she had killed her self. On the contrary, I pretended that being a meer stranger in those parts, it could not be imagined I should harbour so much malice in my breast, as to become the murtherer of one, that had treated me in my sickness with abundance of humanity, besides I said, the weapon which had given Artemesia her deadly wound, was found by all the company in her own hand: but the business being thus to and fro violently disputed, Artemesia's Nurse was sent for, to give further testimony of my carriage towards her Mistress, during my abode in the Castle, which could not chuse but give in the opinion of all there present, a great deal of light in the disputation; however, the malicious old woman imagining her Declarations might afford me some assistance, refused to come, pretending she was necessarily employed in the funeral of her dead Mistress, being locked up with the body in her private chamber; though the truth was, she thirsted after my life, to save the honour of Artemesia , and the whole family, since by that means I should not have the opportunity to divulge her preposterous love; so that at last I was not onely found guilty, but condemned privately to lose my head within the Castle Court; fearing belike in my last speech, I would publish some passages, that might render the people satisfied of my innocency, and Artemesia's lasciviousness. Thus finding all my honest Rhetorick could not prevail in my just defence, to secure me from condemnation, I resolved to declare my person, hoping that although it might not prove of sufficient force to divert my judgement, yet nevertheless it would be a motive to protract my execution, until Philos returned from Damascus ; which declaration happily met with my expectation: For after the Judges with much amazement, had entertained the knowledge of my condition, being the son of him who was esteemed so intimate a friend to the Kingdom of Syria , they not onely presently signed my Reprieve; but conveighed me with all the respect their Laws would give them leave, back again to the prison, where I remained until Philos return, who brought with him the news of Philostros death and burial, though four dayes time was spent after his arrival, before he offered me a visit; in which space I had liberty enough for consideration what would be my fate: At last he came, and saluted me with this discourse, to my no small admiration. My Lord, said he, I must not onely desire you, to forget all your ill usage in this Castle, but to interpret the reasons, to have proceeded from a womans unruly passion (for I cannot give it a better Title) without my privity, which my future actions and my present discourse shall testifie, if either you will believe my words, or pardon my intentions. Be pleased then in short to know, for my resolution is to make unto you a particular confession, and after commit my self unto your goodness and mercy; that when you and the fair Princess Cloria were at Memphis with Orsames , it was my fortune to be conquered by the power of love, proceeding not onely from the excellency of her beauty and conversation, but as I may say was thrust upon me, by such a forceable and precipitate fate, that could not be contradicted by the power of any reason or temper; insomuch as I must tell you, in regard of those passions, I could neither eat, sleep, nor rest with convenient satisfaction; so that I conceived my self obliged for my preservation, to contrive a project with with the Lydian Ambassadour, then remaining at Memphis , which was to interrupt your passage at Sea going into Cyprus , whereby the better to make a separation between your love, and that which the Princess bore you, that both mine, and my sister Artemesia's might succeed in the places: And however the Gods prevented rather the manner of execution, then the effect of our designs, by contrary storms and accidents at Sea, yet I must now inform you, that as your self by fortune were taken by our ships, which hath since produced this late dismal mishap concerning my sister, so the Princess Cloria by chance falling upon the Coasts of the Island of Crete , is now delivered into the possession of the Senate of Lydia ; and they as I am informed, from those Ambassadours of our Countrey that are at Sardis , intend with some violence to bestow her in marriage upon her Couzen Cassianus Prince of Iberia , whereby the better to fortifie their pretensions and titles against King Euarchus her father; however they seemed for a long time to play with my hopes, as if they onely intended her for my satisfaction; belike imagining that such an expectation would alwayes be sufficient to continue our Family faithful to their purposes, and so consequently make my Uncle Philostros ever willing, to employ his power with Orsames for their advantages; but he being now dead, (which news they have already received in Lydia ) they publickly disclaim from having any such intention, as believing now we can no more contribute profitably to their designs: wherefore as my thoughts and resolutions intend a present retirement in some place of Religion, to seek pardon of the Gods for my many violent and unjust ambitions, so did I very well know, their mercies in no kinde were to be obtained, without such a particular declaration of my own faults, which I have now made unto you: As I can no way doubt of your charity and compassion in my behalf, according to the nobleness of your nature; so may you be pleased to take what free liberty you please for your departure, with a promise also on my part, to be ready to assist you with my best services, either in your loves to the fairest Princess, or upon what other occasion soever that may make you better honoured and esteemed in the world. After he had delivered thus much, I must confess I was so well satisfied with this discourse; not onely in regard of your safety, but also in respect of my own releasement, that Philos imagined as I then thought by my present actions and expression, that I meant to run away from him; for suddenly taking me by the hand, he said he had a few more words to deliver unto me, that concerned his Sisters proceedings, since he held it most necessary, his own innocency might be cleared to the full; for that in no particular he protested, was he guilty of my last usage. As I cannot deny, said he, but that I kindled the first sparkles by my commendation of your person and worth; that afterward flamed so violently in my Sisters bosom; so of the other side, I never expected it should have broken out to such an ominous passion, whereby you were to be injured without measure, as my Sister destroyed beyond example: But as the Gods have their secret workings in all humane things, we must with patience and reverence submit all our endeavours to their pleasure, which will for the most part keep us from extravagant and wicked actions; since however sometimes we fail by misprision, yet by a small repentance we shall again be brought into our accustomed temper; when as letting loose the reins of our desires without moderation, we are born into a vast Sea of confusion, that produceth nothing but prodigious destructions, as it fared with Artemesia , who was resolved because she could not obtain suddenly what her own thoughts perhaps esteemed lawful, to convert that passion to so strong a hate, that of necessity would not onely render the object of her wishes nothing, but her self miserable without hope of ever being able to enjoy what she so much longed for; however her old nurses counsels, although they did not contribute to her passions, yet they produced those projects that caused your ill usage; for finding you were not by any fair means to be won to my Sisters desires, she advised her to assay the contrary, to try if that course could terrifie you to consent: All which Artemesia confessed before her death, her body again reviving after it was brought into her private Chamber; as also with many tears and sighs entreated your pardon, which I thought good to acquaint you with, that her unfeigned repentance might procure your charitable forgiveness: And with that taking me by the hand again, with tears in his eyes, he desired me as a testimony of a perfect reconciliation, I would vouchsafe the pains to visit the dead Corpse before the Funeralls, which shortly were to be performed. Although I went with him as fully contented in my minde, as he seemed oppressed with sorrow for his Sisters death; yet I could not chuse but have a noble compassion at the remembrance of the Ladies hard fate, especially for that the cause was onely for over-much loving me: but at my arrival, instead of imbracing the dead body, to my wonderful amazement, I was saluted with these words from living Artemesia . My Lord, said she, that you may not think you converse with dead (though changed) Artemesia , you must first know, that after I had performed in your lodgings that unparalleld action of my mad rage, bathed all over with mine own blood, I was carried into my Chamber, whilst you unknown to me was in danger to have suffered unjustly for my fault; and being there, by the careful industry of mine own Physician, without the privity of any, but such as were intrusted about my person, I was not onely recovered from my trance, but before my Brothers arrival put out of danger of death; however, I desired the business might be kept secret from the knowledge of all but my intimate servants, since I was resolved to quit the world by a more religious way, not being willing to support the shame of so detestable a fact: Yet considering that an absolute repentance could not be, where there wants an intention of full satisfaction, I was desirous with my own mouth, to make this declaration, before I enter into the strict rules of my pennance, by which I humbly and sorrowfully beg your pardon, wishing a perpetual prosperity to the chaste loves between you and the Princess Cloria . And this, my Lord, being all I have to say to you, I desire you will have no more remembrance of me, then meerly what charity instructs your pious thoughts. And with these words she drew close the curtains of her bed, not willing to be seen, or any more spoken withall. These things, I must confess, rather appeared to my imagination visions then actions, until with as much honour as could be devised, I was set free by Philos , who also courteously offered to accompany me with his best service in my journey; but because I was resolved to visit the place of your abode in a disguize, (not onely for that I knew you were in the custody of your enemies, but also in that I had a desire to understand by the way, the secrets of the Senates intention, concerning Cassianus love, which I must confess gave my thoughts some trouble) I refused his offer. As this discourse seemed to give a singular content to the lovely Princesse, demonstrated by many visible signs, both in her eyes and blushes; so Roxana , who had all the while, with a most exact attentiveness, given ear to his several relations, uttered this language, with a kinde of a formal gravity: Truly my Lord, said she, you have not onely gallantly now cleared all our doubts and fears, but also in my opinion have carried your self in your difficult adventures, more like a valiant Martyr, then a constant Lover, which I must confess deserves both praise and requital: And yet Governess, said the Princesse, we must not commend him over-much, lest he expect a greater reward then we shall be willing to afford him. Dear Cloria , replied Narcissus , I cannot but confess my own covetousnesse, since no lesse a present can content my thoughts, then your admirable self, which is a Jewel beyond the price of the whole world: But said Cloria , the chief property of Jewels are to be looked upon at a distance; wherefore, if you will be satisfied onely with that liberty and moderation, perhaps I shall without much difficulty grant your request. Yet Madam, replied Roxana , it is most necessary he make choice of some other apparel, better to become his person; so may you have both the conveniency now and then to meet in these walks without suspition, untill the confusion now in the Kingdome afford you a greater liberty. But Narcissus most earnestly entreated to be entertained at a nearer distance; however without fruit, in regard both Cloria and Roxana apprehended, that his passion to see Cassianus sometimes received as a Suitor, though but with appearing complements, would provoke him to some actions, which might either prejudice their liberties, or discover his person,: for that neither of them could yet be over-confident, of Cassianus intentions and fidelity concerning the old Flamin , although he had not since their late discourse, either shewed any manner of discontent, or so much as troubled them with visits. Narcissus , when he saw he could not by any means prevail in his desire, as if he had been at the instant possest with some Poetical fury, began this complaint in Verse; which the Princess, being excellent also in that faculty, as quickly answered ex tempore .  O dearest Love, recal thy hard decree, that seems both rigorous to thee and me; The coldest Rocks, though cover'd all with Snow, upon the Suns approach begin to thaw. Yet vertue must not so admit a flame, to be it self endangered by the same; As appetites do kindle false desires, discretion must oppose t' allay the fires. Pray do not so, prophane a holy name by scruples, that do onely vertue stain; Long since I have your word; yours is a debt, wherefore unjust the payment to neglect. But 'tis extortion, not a lawful due, to take by force, and never rightly sue; When contracts name no time, (you know) we may defer the payment to a longer day. Far more unjust for to defraud a law, onely by sleights, that fain would over-awe Performance: No Cloria , you ought to know, the race being won, the prize you must bestow. I partly grant your argument; howe're you must not be the judge, my parents bear The greatest share in government, since I am theirs, and borrow but my liberty. Surely that tie's dissolv'd and free, when they have neither power to give, or we to pray; If the exigence be such to them and we, no reason that our right should hindred be. You still mistake; I do no right refuse, but for preventions onely physick use, To temper heady sense, which well I see, looks chiefly at it self, and mindes not me. You Heavens above, when did you ever read, of such a temper, which you seem to plead? Have not the Gods approv'd the influence, that your Philosophy would make but sense? Such false Deities as you example, were, but onely Poets gods, whose lust and fear, Render'd their Nuptials rapes, vice their design, and did but cozen fools with names divine. Where shall we seek to finde Religion then, if not in love of either gods or men? This paradox observ'd, will surely turn the world into a Chaos, and men to burn. Rather such loves were nought but sensual dreams, that made their thoughts a Chaos of extreams; Still craving more, without the harmony of souls, that onely us can satisfie. Alas, dear soul! although your Rhetorick, would fain perswade my trembling heart that's sick, To what you please; yet 'twere hypocrisie, for me to seem to like your tyranny. Ne're did a Tyrant practice temperance; my innocence seeks onely to advance, The Laws of Love and Honour, those being left, marriage is a thraldome or a theft. How should I plead for love, much less contend, when you in love will not become my friend? But leave me with tortures the fruit to catch, that you with crafty slights from me do snatch. 'Tis passion not craft, that injures love, and from your self not me, your torments move, Which ought be checkt, lest our expected joyes in future times prove but confused toyes. At leastwise I must call that temper cruel, that starves my flames for want of fitting fuel, Since I can neither quench those fires that burn, or warm my self which way so e're I turn. There is no means so good to still a flame, as for to cast on milk upon the same: Calm then your thoughts, and be content to bear the just decree, which passion will not hear. Certainly fair Creature you feel no pain, that wooes me thus my passions to refrain; For those that tortures taste upon the rack, cannot be blamed if they some courage lack. Yet such as fail in their own constancy, imply a guilt, and do as faulty dye; When others that their trials overcome, do save their lives, and gain a Laurel Crown. After the Princess had thus perswaded Narcissus to be contented, finding the time of the day gave them no more opportunity, she rose up to return to the Castle; however assuring him as often as she could without danger to her self, she would frequent those walks for his satisfaction: This being the decree, all the favours poor Narcissus could obtain further of the willfull Princess was, onely one parting kiss, in recompence of all his travels; which being obtained, she and her Governess went home joyfully discoursing of their good fortune, which continued Cloria's thought in such a paradise all the night following, that scarce did her fair eyes entertain any rest at all; Thus, as I say, she took pains to please her imagination, whilst her body wanted that sleep it necessarily required; which was an occasion that after dinner the next day she cast her self upon her bed, something to supply the defect of the night past; but presently upon her waking, her Dwarf told her that a young handsome Priest at the gate, humbly desired to be admitted to the speech of her Highness, having, as he said, business of great consequence to impart unto her. This sudden intelligence gave Cloria's thoughts some trouble, doubting a disasterous adventure, the rather for that her newly being wakened from the Ideas of her chief delight, it seemed to interrupt her apprehension with a contrary fear, of being dispossest of what she had enjoyed by her flattering fancy; however she called Roxana to accompany her in the expectation, commanding the little messenger not onely to usher in that stranger, that seemed so importunate, but afterward himself to wait in the outward room, because she would have none privy to the business, before she and her Governess were informed of the contents. But no sooner did Cloria view this new intruder, but she knew him to be him, whom she most desired to see, her young servant Narcissus ; who had borrowed the habit of one of Apollo's Priests, in a Temple where he lodged the night past amongst the Woods, to keep him from every ones knowledge but her own, and her intrusted Governess Roxana: Nevertheless the rigid old woman began to rail down right at his presumption, vowing with his too much passion he would destroy them all; this gave Cloria occasion to laugh heartily, seeing her poor servant with innocent looks to undergo the cholerick reproof of Roxana , without replying one single word to her hasty language; yet his patience not onely by little and little procured him his peace, but after a long conference with his compassionate Mistriss, by the free consent of her Governess, who at last became perswaded, he was entertained for a houshold servant; however the sweet Princess seemed unwilling, to prophane his sacred robes with any hypocrisie. But one day Cassianus coming to visit the Princess, the Gods know with what an envious jealousie Narcissus underwent this ceremony; sometimes he had a will to have interrupted his passage at the entrance into her Chamber; other while again, he thought to have alledged she was asleep, and could not be disquieted in her rest; and last of all, he began to have a resolution to quit his borrowed habit, and challenge him for his boldness, in pretending in his presence to his right: And a thousand other fancies entertained his imagination, almost in an instant, when there was no more time left him for these considerations, but whilst Cloria was advertised of Cassianus arrival, and he admitted into her Chamber; whither Narcissus followed him with greedy steps to be a curious eye-witness of his behaviour: And when he saw Cloria with a gentle modesty admit of her Cousins salutation, she being not willing to give him any discontent, by reason of the old Flamin , that was at his mercy, his colour began to change in his face; one while the beautiful red seemed to claim an interest in revenge, notwithstanding all the prohibitions of his sweet Mistriss; then again the fair white had the prerogative, and pretended fear to Cloria's commands: So that in this manner, they never left combating in his lovely countenance, until he was rid of the occasion of those disorders. Not many dayes after Cassianus had performed his unwelcome visit, the Senate belike jealous of the Princess safety, in regard the King her Father had been strangely rescued from their power, by that Army, that not long before they esteemed their Subjects, suddenly commanded, not onely those servants to be removed from their accustomed attendance, that had been about her person, but her self and Roxana , to be conducted to a stronger Fort, there to remain with better security, and more honour as they pretended, until the present distractions of Lydia could in some sort be pacified; in which number poor Narcissus became also prescribed, which converted his past content into an unexpressible rage: sometime blaming the Heavens for not punishing the cruelty as he interpreted it, of that unjust and barbarous decree; then again he absolutely fell out with himself, that he had not ability beyond humane force, to prevent the execution of such a pernicious command. But alas, his vain passions were so far from defending the Princess Cloria , against that violence offered to her person, that he had not so much liberty, as by one dear kiss to take leave of her white hand, amongst the rest of her train, who were admitted to that sorrowful honour: For the rigid guard finding by his distracted looks, and extravagant words, that he had not patience enough in his breast, to comply punctually with their strict commission, quickly discharged him from his ordinary attendance, before they disposed of the rest of the servants. This accident soon retired Narcissus into the neighbouring woods, there to complain onely to Rocks and Stones, of the greatness of the Princess injury, and his own misfortunes; in which place he remained in his wilde passion, until want of food and lodging, constrained him to turn his thoughts to consider his present necessity; and to that purpose, resolved to seek some habitation, where he might receive entertainment, until he could further dispose of his determination, since he found these fruitless sorrows and distracted expressions, neither eased his grief or profited his love. Wherefore after he had travelled three or four dayes in the vast Forrest, with such provision onely as he could get in poor and contemptible Cottages, as he past through a thick Wood, which seemed to obscure a certain Plain that lay beyond it, his melancholly ears of a sudden were saluted, with a certain kinde of rude Musick, that appeared also more confused, for that it was at many periods, accompanied with the loud acclamations of common people. As this seemed a strange adventure to his imagination, after such an absolute silence, for so many dayes in his solitary perambulation; where doleful ecchoes appeared to have been in a manner his onely companions, with the uncouth fall of waters from high and unaccessible precipices, so the unexpected newness again of probability of humane conversation, put on a little his desire to be curious, though scarce was he willing to allow himself any content at all, since she that was the delight of his soul, had been forcibly separated from his sight: Nevertheless prosecuting his intention, he directed his steps towards the place where he heard the noise, through the intangled Bryers, and almost impassable bushes, which sufficiently moderated his haste and protracted his march; yet at last with much pain, he arrived near the outside of the Wood, where he might perceive through the Branches of the Trees in a spacious Plain, a great many of Countrey people gathered about a little Altar, raised six steps above the ground; at which stood an old Priest offering sacrifice to the God Pan , as appeared by his statue placed upon certain bases composed of rough stone, and with more unpolished workmanship. This discovery invited Narcissus to attend the issue with silence; and the rather for that at every full point, and stop of the Priest in his devotions, the multitude suddenly took hands in a joyful agreement one with another, and danced many rounds, about the Image in a rural manner, to the onely Musick of their untunable voices, though a certain Ditty which he could not understand by any words they uttered, appeared to express the intention of their mirth, though onely known to themselves, in respect of the rudeness of the language, and the harshness of the delivery. When Narcissus had a long time entertained his wonder, with the sight of this extraordinary pastime, desiring also to satisfie his understanding of the reason of their assembly, he approached nearer the company, with an intention to enquire of some standing by, not onely what the occasion might be of that solemnity, but how he should the readiest way, finde out the next convenient Town to give him reception; and the opportunity fitted well with his desire; for the Priest having performed all the rites and ceremonies belonging to his office, was newly retired some distance from the multitude, to a small rising bank; as well to repose himself, as to behold with greater conveniency the continued sport, wherein he seemed to have more then an ordinary interest; which made Narcissus quickly address himself to him with this courteous language. Father, said he, I hope it is the custom in these parts, especially amongst those of your profession, not to take ill any curiosity of a stranger, that seeks civilly to be enformed, as well in the manners of the Countrey where he passeth, as of a convenient place that may give him entertainment: And that I may prevent your demand, which I make no doubt but will seem necessary to your judgement, be pleased to know that I am by birth of the Island of Cyprus , and intending a pilgrimage to the Temple of Delphos , am by chance fallen into your company. The Priest seeing himself saluted by a young man, though in his own habit, of such an excellent beauty, and so perfect a shape, presently not onely rose up from his seat, to give him the more respectful welcome, but told him for his lodging the night to come, since the time of the day perhaps might prevent him of a better conveniency, he should hold an extraordinary honour, that his own poor habitation might perform the service: And the rather, as he said, for that their professions seemed to agree by the outward resemblance of the Robes. Narcissus was not much displeased with the offer, as well because he found himself something weary, by reason of those extravagant and uncertain journeyes he had made, as also that he might hope by this opportunity, to get further information concerning his own resolutions, that yet he had not fully determined. Wherefore after he had returned the Father a civil thanks for his favour, with an intimation he was willing to accept of his charitable kindness, they both sate down together upon the Bank- side, to behold the finishing of those rural delights, that passionately seemed to imploy the Countrey people; which gave occasion to Narcissus , to demand the reason of that extraordinary mirth, that possessed the thoughts of the whole company. The Priest after he had a little smiled, to think of the strangers apprehension, told him, since he perceived his curiosity went so far, as to be satisfied in those petty affairs, he would take the pains to let him know the original that produced the effects; which as he said was the more proper for his entertainment, since the occasion at the present, detained almost all Asia both in expectation and wonder; however he feared his story might be too tedious for his patience. But Narcissus seeming rather passionate at the satisfaction then distasted at the offer; the Priest retired something further into the Woods, to be more out of the noise of the people, where after he had settled the strangers expectation to a silent attentiveness, he began this discourse. Sir, said he, you must be pleased to know, that our King Euarchus Grandmother called Minerva (by whose right he came to wear all those Crowns he was once possessor of, and might still have enjoyed in a prosperous measure, if his fortunes had been equal to his goodness, or his Subjects loyalty answerable to his own eminent worth) was a Princess, of such excellent vertues, that it had been a controversie between art and nature, whether had more bountifully contributed, to the adorning of her Royal Person; however she onely reigned in Mysia , a Countrey not onely barren in production of the fruits of the earth, but luxurious in the unfaithfulness of the people, though her birth justly claimed the inheritance of this rich Kingdom of Lydia , after our Queen then reigning here; I say this admirable Princess, had a base Brother also, named Leonatus , who wanted not ambition enough to desire the Crown of Mysia , though he were not furnished with sufficient vertues to merit such a dignity; and to this purpose, left nothing unattempted, that might either advance his own esteem or deprave his Sisters actions; and to that end insinuated himself by all means possible, not onely into the good opinion of the Lords, but much more into the favour of the comon people; in which interim the young Princess, being furnished with youth and beauty, was perswaded by the chief Nobility to think of a noble Husband, that might accompany her in her conversation, and give the Kingdom a hope of posterity; two essential parts as they pretended of her own happiness: in prosecution of this desire, there was presented unto her view, a handsome Lord of this our Countrey of Lydia: in conclusion the Nuptials were quickly solemnized, to the appearing content of both parties; and the rather for that the then Queen of Lydia , was well satisfied with the choice, not doubting to maintain by this means a continual and strong interest in the Kingdome of Mysia , since she had married to the Princess one of her own Subjects. But now Leonatus began to play his part; for finding this conjunction proved a bar to his pretension for succession, he thought it his best way, to establish himself notwithstanding, a certain power in the Government; and to that purpose strived by all means his malicious will could instruct, to gain the good opinion of the young King, whereby to set him at difference with the Queen, who began to be a little distasted, to see his Wife take upon her so absolute Authority, he onely bearing the name of a Prince; which at last grew to such a height, by the underhand provocation of wicked Leonatus , that one day when the Queen (being great with Childe) was retired into her private Chamber, to confer with a certain Secrety of State, most imployed in the Kingdoms Affairs, her Husband of a sudden rusht into her presence with his Sword drawn, and there before her amazed eyes, slaughtered her poor Servant. However this was an act of some horrour to the great-bellied Queen, and so consequently might be thought sufficient motives of her lasting indignation, to see her self and Authority so affronted, by one she had lately raised from being a Subject to be her Husband; yet religion and good nature proved so powerful in her noble disposition, that upon the Kings sorrow and submission, she was content both to forgive the injury, and forget the dishonour by a perfect reconciliation. But Leonatus not weary yet of his own wickedness, though despairing of his further ability, to retain his interest with the young King, since the Queen as he thought had so absolutely circumvented him in that project, of a sudden struck into friendship with certain factious Priests, that had newly brought in a Religion into Mysia , that taught this dangerous Doctrine; That Princes deserved no longer to Govern, then whilst they contented the people . Which opinion you may very well imagine, took feelingly with the multitude, insomuch as in a short time, the Queen had imployment enough to defend her person from reproaches, as her Kingdom from Civil War: This exceedingly tormented her thoughts, until the birth of her young Son again revived her spirits. However Leonatus still prosecuting his horrid designs, to supplant the Queen in her just right, whereby to bring the Government of the Kingdom under his own jurisdiction, one night secretly caused, not onely the young King to be cruelly murthered in his Bed, in execution of his revenge, because he had quitted his party, but also laid the bloody slaughter, by way of private aspersions, upon the innocent and religious Queen; the more to bring her in hatred with the common people, who seemed already sufficiently poisoned, by the late pernicious doctrine brought into the Countrey by the turbulent Priests: Although these crafty practises, had not as yet power to shake, or rather absolutely to destroy her grounded authority, which had been cast upon her by so rightful a succession; yet by little and little they so wounded her reputation, that they made her desire to have a faithful companion, to assist her in her government; which politick Leonatus perceiving, judging it a love passion in the Queen, put on some of the Nobility underhand to perswade her, not onely presently to marry, but to take for her Husband a valiant Gentleman his intimate friend, who a long time had pretended unto her love, however he was not without some suspicion, that he had been an actor in the Kings death; with these baits, I say, Leonatus so far intangled the Queens innocency, that she was won by perswasion to make this election, being counselled thereunto by the chief Nobility, set upon her to that purpose, though she first caused a decree to be past by the unanimous consent of all, that this Lord had been no way guilty, of the false aspersion his enemies had cast upon him, concerning the Kings murther. No sooner were these Nuptials solemnized, which was the thing Leonatus desired, but secretly he admonished the new King to flye, assuring him as his friend, that either he would be suddenly slain by many that had conspired his death, or publickly be apprehended and brought to his Tryal by the consent of the whole Kingdom; so that he, whether knowing himself faulty indeed, or fearing the power and injustice of his enemies, since emulation amongst his equals had procured him a world of envy, quickly followed his advice, and privately without the Queens privity, quitted his Countrey and Fortunes. Leonatus , conceiving now he had compassed the hardest part of his projects, sent secretly into Lydia to possess the Queen there, with an assurance of Minerva's guilt, since she had married the murtherer of her first Husband; too apparently as he pretended discovered, by his strange flight: At the same time also, by the help of his factious Priests, he raised tumults against her, in her own Kingdom, whereby she became imprisoned, because she would not quit her government. This you may believe, gave the poor Queen sufficient imployment; insomuch as being wearied by continual troubles, and invited to the Court of Lydia by her Kinswomans promises, for her better and quiet protection, she was content to resign the Crown to her Son, and accept of those offers she esteemed real. But alas, no sooner was she arrived within the bounds of this Kingdom of Lydia , but contrary to her expectation, (wherefore amazed in the execution) instead of being admitted into the Queens presence with Love and Honour, she was commanded as a prisoner to a Castle not far off; whilst in the mean time her young Son, was committed to the tuition of Leonatus her worst enemy; however with this pretension, that as soon as she could clear her self, of those aspersions and accusations that her subjects brought against her, she should enjoy those respects at a Court, which had been largely promised her; though in the interim, she must be content with her fortune, since the State of Lydia thought it not fit, for one in her condition, bespotted with the opinion of so black a crime, should have any correspondence with their Queen, as 'twas pretended, of so bright a vertue; when the Gods know, it was either the too much clearness of her own good parts, or the rightfulness of her title, being of a contrary Religion, that was the onely obstacle of her happiness. But whilst Minerva under-went for many years a hard imprisonment in Lydia , since the Queen her self was so far from easing her of her bonds, as she would never give ear to her complaints; the King her young Son began to approach to mans estate, and that matureness in age gave him a feeling of his mothers oppressions: but her enemies in Mysia , being also backt from the States in these parts, who had an intention all they could to suppress his greatness, that he might have no power to claim his Right in the Kingdom of Lydia , gave his thoughts and actions not onely continual interruptions, but at last imprisoned his very person in his own Kingdom. Notwithstanding all this, the wise King bore these insolencies with unexampled patience, knowing, that as it was not in his power to free himself from their tyranny by any Kingly pretension; so of the other side, he hoped that factions amongst themselves would at last purchase his liberty. In this state he continued, until his Guard found, that it might be prejudicial to his Titles in Lydia , after the old Queens death, to keep him thus as a prisoner, whereby they might also be debarred, from a plentiful share of the gain when Lydia by succession should fall to him: Upon these considerations they of a sudden not onely released him from his confinement, but every one of these men themselves strived, who might be most in his favour; when as he not onely as a good natured Prince, forgot all his injuries, but became sufficiently pleased to be at liberty, upon any terms whatsoever. But the old Queen of Lydia , drawing now to her last period both of life and Kingdom; conceiving it was reason sufficient for a just jealousie, to have the Heir apparant so near her jurisdiction, whom she imagined looked upon her continuance like a young blossome, that strived to thrust out the ancient and withered flower from its stalk, began suddenly to question the poor Princess (her self also being almost worn out by her hard usage) about her correspondence with those forreign powers, who were of her kindred; And not content with any answer the truth of her proceedings could make, called her to her trial before ordinary Commissioners. As these might be evident marks of Minerva's ruine, so were they not undiscovered by the sharp apprehension of the wise Lady, though her spiteful fate would not afford her preservation, notwithstanding her excellent endowments: yet as she had good cause, she excepted against those partial Judges designed for her destruction, by all the pretentions that a free Princess, or an opprest woman could alledge, though the Queen seemed as deaf to her just and reasonable request, as her enemies were violently bent to satifie their cruelties; until in the end she was forced to desist from her importunities, and stick wholly to the confidence her goodness had merited in the Gods mercies. This not onely brought her to a Judgement-seat, prepared with some outward circumstances fit to entertain her dignity, but to a condemnation prepared with ceremony, to bewitch the understanding of the common people, who rather desired to behold strange spectacles, then to be delighted in just actions; and in this May game, as I may call it, of the worst cruelty, when the form of Law was onely made use of to hide bad intentions, was this brave and religious Queen, as a period to all her fortunes, sentenced to lose her head. Notwithstanding this condemnation, the Queen of Lydia for some time deferred the execution, conceiving her own honour could not but suffer abroad, in the opinion of all other Princes her equals, as her Kinswoman in person did at home under her jurisdiction. But ambition, jealousie, and revenge, at last got the victory over all her other vertues, by the malicious and crafty perswasions of Minerva's enemies, who believed, they could not be safe as long as she lived; since it was probable, if ever she came to wear the Crown of Lydia , she would alwayes be mindefull of their disaffections: These reasons, I say, procured the Queen under-hand, to sign a warrant for Minerva's death, which by the Laws of the Countrey, could not else be taken away by any power; and with this Authority a Messenger presently was sent to the chief Officer of the Province, to give Minerva warning of her approaching doom. When the sad Princess beheld this bloody character written with the Royal Hand of her nearest Kinswoman, it was a question, whether amazement or courage governed most in her noble thoughts; for as of one side she could scarce believe, that the Queen had been drawn to an act so prejudicial to the honour of her Sex, so of the other side, she entertained the news with a gentle smile, as a wished period of all her miseries; onely with three or four deep sighs, she desired these requests of those Commissioners that had authority to see the sentence put in execution: First, that she might have all her servants about her at the time of her death, to bear true testimony to the world, that she neither staggered in her Religion, nor derogated from her Sons Honour: Next that the Queen would be so charitable, as not onely quietly to suffer those that attended about her person, in safety to quit the Kingdom, but to pay them their due wages, if not reward them according to the just service she had received: And lastly, that she might have a Priest of her own profession, to comfort and instruct her in her last suffering. To the first, they onely answered, that as they could not give her leave to have all her attendants about her for fear of tumults, by reason of their multitudes, so were they willing to allow her some few to satisfie her desire. For the second, they promised to be intercessors to the Queen in her behalf. But for the last, they absolutely refused her request, pretending it would be a dishonour to the Religion professed in Lydia . With these answers Minerva retired into her Chamber, the better to prepare her religious thoughts against the next dayes Combat, where she remained all that night, with so constant a zeal to the Worship of the Gods, and chearful a demeanour in the perswading of her servants to patience, by contemning of all worldly prosperity, that it was easily to be perceived, she rather entertained death as a kinde friend, that intended to put her in possession of a better life, then as a fierce enemy, that set before her imagination frights of a horrid destruction: Thus she continued her imployment, until the early morning and watchful cruelty, brought to her Chamber door the instruments of her destruction: This warning was sufficient to make her prepare with Majesty, to act the last scene that should render her famous to posterity. Wherefore with a pleasant look, as if she intended to laugh at deaths worst shape, when she came out she bid the company good morrow, and then proceeded to the Scaffold, with all the circumstances belonging to her dignity, that was covered over with black Velvet; where being set in her dismal Chair of State, she told the spectators, that as they must not expect many words from her, in regard her Sister the Queen of Lydia was not present, to whom she would onely have directed a discourse; so of the other side, she wisht them all to bear witness, that she constantly expired in that Religion she ever profest to the world, for which she both did, and was joyful to shed her best Blood; which being said, by one and one she took leave of her servants, who being overprest with grief and tears, were scarce able to perform their last, though constrained duties, to fit their glorious Mistriss for her execution: And with another sweet smile, holding up her white hands to the Omnipotent Gods for mercy, not long after without the least unquiet motion, she received that fatal stroke, that sent her soul to an eternal habitation. When this unexampled Tragedy became spread over Asia , which gave sufficient occasion of large discourses. It could not but with speedier wings flie to her Sons Court, accompanied with all the particular circumstances of her death, where it rested until an Ambassador from the Queen of Lydia was sent, in some sort to lessen the fact, as being absolutely done without her privity as he pretended, to which purpose some of her principal Councellors had been punished: But this Balsom a long time, had not power to heal the deep wound this apprehended cruelty, had made in his dutiful bosom, until his people finding that Myssia was not able to contend with Lydia in any revenge, and that the smallest attempt offered by way of force to vindicate his honour, might interrupt his quiet and peaceable succession to a Crown so rich and flourishing, which ere long he could not by course of nature but expect, since the Queen was both old and decayed, not onely disswaded him from any hostile evasion, but also counselled him to entertain a firm correspondency with the State he was to possess, and the rather, for that the Lydian Messenger threatned him, with a legal deprivation from his Royal Right, by the consent of the whole Kingdom, in whose judgement (as he said) his Mother had been condemned, if any way he stirred violently to disturb the peace establisht in both Countreys. These reasons (I say) render'd him as well satisfied in shew as in effect, who was esteemed extreamly peaceable, if not slothful in his nature; which was the occasion, that as he could never be brought willingly to enter upon any actions of glory, so did it make him for the most part, as it were a captive to the pressing importunities of his covetous and insolent Countreymen the Myssians , who scarce would be satisfied with any gain or preferment whatsoever he could bestow upon them. But to be short, at last the old Queen of Lydia dying, he without any contradiction quickly took possession of her Kingdoms, in which government he continued with all the prosperity in the world during his life: That finished, the Crowns of Lydia, Myssia , and Crete , descended by a just right upon his hopeful Son and Successor Euarchus , then newly married to Hyacinthia Orsames Sister, (our now Queen) who enjoyed also those possessions (I must needs say) with as much happiness (until these last stirs) as it was possible for mortality to expect. But the Myssians , who as I said before received golden liberalities in the time of the old King, (he being a Prince that knew no way how to be provident) when they found that Euarchus numerous issue, and the Queens necessary expences, did in a manner drown all their expectation; first began to mutter in words against the accustomed vanities of the times; and lastly they found fault that onely smooth-faced boyes enjoyed, (as they said) all the Credit of the Court, when Souldiers and men of valour wanted both countenance and means to live, the King being so bewitched to his own ease, and Wives content, that he could not be drawn to help his own Brother-in-law, against the oppressions of the King of Armenia ; by which War many might be imployed that now wanted subsistance: Nor was there wanting in Lydia it self many factious spirits, that not onely received encouragement by this bold language, who also coveted State preferment in the Government of the Common-weale: Yet these begun discontents lay hid in the cinders of some duty, until new taxations of the Subjects gave more desperate distastes; besides, the accidental arrival of Prince Cassianus in Lydia after his Fathers death, stirred up the pride of one Dimogoras to a new spleen against the King, by which means he believed he should be the sooner imployed. But that which seemed most to contribute to Euarchus prejudice, was the sudden arrival of an old Myssian Captain out of the Wars of Armenia called Lycius , who having gained in those services good store of wealth, sued to the King to have himself rewarded by Titles of Honour; which being denyed him by some neglect, as also Cassianus request for a competent assistance, a little protracted, this insolent Commander quickly flew from the Court with execrations in his mouth, and malice in his heart; and so coming into his own Countrey, omitted no diligence that could withdraw the people from their lawful obedience; which he had the better opportunity to effect, since he found not onely the Nobility ambitious, but the Priests violent. The one he perswaded with brave spirits again to look upon the courage of their Ancestors, who had by force of Arms torn Priviledges from their Kings; the other he admonished, to cast their thoughts upon the recovery of that Religion now almost lost, that had formerly chased their former Queen both from her Kingdome and life; and for the common people it was sufficient to plead to their imaginations liberty; by whose perswasion, the Nobility not onely raised a power absolutely to contemn the Kings Authority in their own Countrey of Myssia , but also led a great Army presently into Lydia , whereby to compell Euarchus to summon the great Councel of that Kingdome also. To be short, when this eminent Assembly was met, as it was designed in the City of Sardis , which was also assured to be made a free Town (as much to say, as not to be compelled to any obedience to Euarchus and his posterity) the chiefest discourses that were made there, were in disgrace of the Kings actions, and almost all the Acts that past were to destroy his Authority: All which the milde King suffered with a world of patience, hoping that time after they had wearied themselves with their violent passions, would let them see their own mistakes, or the Gods at leastwise would defend his innocency: However these unexpected proceedings not onely continued, but their rage grew to such a height against his person, whereby as 'twas thought to bring him into the greater contempt amongst the common people, that by divers tumults countenanced in the multitude, he was at last forced from the City of Sardis , whilst the Senate in the interim instituted a strong guard of Souldiers of the Town Forces, to wait upon their Councels, because they would shew to the Subjects, greater marks of Sovereignty in their Assembly, then in the Kings Dignity. But whilst many were brewing their own passionate designs with uncredible insolency, being chiefly supported by the votes of the common people, who were perswaded they should recover by the Senates Authority an absolute liberty, the poor King with a very small train retired to the City of Theatyra : Where however, contrary to the expectation of the Senators, who believed that their discountenance, was sufficient to render him abandoned by the whole Kingdom, he not onely received better welcome, but was entertained with the general commiseration of most of those parts, who bitterly complained of his hard (and as they thought) unjust usage; and the rather did this pitty prevail, for that by his eloquent and fluent Pen, he seemed fully to beat back all the aspersions, his enemies sought daily to cast upon him; which brought (as I say) to his Court multitudes of Gentry and Nobility, both from the City of Sardis and other parts, who vowed perpetual faithfulness to his person, with other essential services. These encouragements by the perswasion of his trusty Councellors, made him imploy his best industry to raise Souldiers, whilst in the interim he sent to the Queen, whom he understood was in the Island of Cyprus , to procure him Arms, by the credit she had purchased with the Duke of that Countrey, since the Senate had already seized upon all his Magazine and Ships: After which he went from one province to another, to feel the inclination of the people; yet as he found most of them for him in their words when he was amongst them; whether out of the inconstancy of their own natures, or unwilling to be at any charge to maintain new troubles; as soon as he left them personally, they were for the greatest number carried from their former professions; so that he perceived the success of his whole fortunes, was chiefly to depend upon the gallantry of the better sort. And truly this expectation did not deceive him; for in a short space, beyond all belief, they so furnished him with moneys, besides their own attendance, that he became master of a brave Army commanded by his Nephew Prince Thyasmus , who was newly arrived in his Camp from the Armenian Wars. The Senate, who before had raised Forces to contend against the Kings intentions, according to the intelligence they had received, not to be slothful in their affairs, quickly created Dimogoras General in the design, whom they knew was a man never to be reconciled to his Sovereign, by reason of the spightfulness of his own violent ambition: no sooner was he establisht in his office, but he was commanded to march, as they pretended to separate the King from pernicious Councels, and bring him safe to Sardis , there to be better governed; to which purpose that City had plentifully furnished money, conceiving their prosperity depended upon their Princes ruine. This resolution was quickly known to Euarchus , and not long after considered by his Councel, that it was high time to advance with the whole Army, to try the fortune of a Battle with the Senates General, since the King wanted provision, and could not expect supplies of money to furnish out the necessary expence: with this determination, after two or three dayes march, they met the Senates Forces upon an ample plain, spacious enough to have decided the controversie for the worlds Empire: The Conflict of a sudden grew so desperate, that it was a question whether they sought more to satisfie their own spleens, or to gain a beneficial Victory; which however was prosecuted for some hours with doubtful fortune; for although the Kings Horse commanded by Thyasmus in person, at the first charge defeated their Enemies, insomuch as for many furlongs they had the chace of their Troop, yet the Foot Forces in their absence, that for the most part wanted Arms, had sufficient imployment to sustain the fury of the Senates Souldiers, being better provided: Which however was bravely supplied by the noble valour of the King himself, insomuch as he sustained the violence of the tempest, until his own Horse again came in to his rescue; though with such a slaughter of his poor Subjects, that it created a most passionate compassion in his Royal Breast, although the determinable fate of his Crown might very well have given a full imployment to his thoughts: Upon Thyasmus appearing with his victorious Troops, Dimogoras retired with his worsted Forces, and the night hindred further prosecution for the present, which as I may say, enviously shadowed the Kings glory, who else could not have been defrauded as 'twas thought, of a most absolute Conquest to his immortal honour, if not to his Kingdoms prosperity. However he resolved the next morning early, again to set upon his Enemies, who were retired for their better safety, within the protection of their secure Trenches; but contrary to his expectation Dimogoras (belike fearing Euarchus intention, and unwilling to hazzard the Senates fortunes in one doubtful adventure) had made use of the dark coverture of the night, to convey himself and his whole Forces, to a strong Town not far off, remaining under his jurisdiction: Nevertheless, so much opinion this half conquest had got amongst the common people, that many Cities presently returned under the obedience of their lawful Prince, whilst in the mean time, the King made Philadelphia the chief residence of his Royal Court, where again he began to rule like a Monarch, and suffered his other Generals in many parts of the Kingdom, to prosecute his commands with such prosperous success, that in a short space he became in a manner Master of all Lydia , though the great Town of Sardis seemed still with most obstinate pride to contemn his power, being more in love with that passion, that made them hope to be a free City, and the covetousness to obtain payment of that money they had disbursed, then mindful of their own safety and obedience. The King who began to think now the difficulty of his affairs were past all danger, began a little to play with the weakness of his Enemies; insomuch as his Souldiers became neglected in their discipline, as the Commanders licentious in their course of life, which certainly contributed extreamly to all his misfortunes: for being provoked either by unwise, if not traiterous Councel, or put on by his own just spleen to see himself in the height of all his Victories disobeyed by weak Forces, suddenly besieged a small City that lay in the very heart of his new Conquests, conceiving his Enemies wanted power of resistance, or at least ability to bring him any incommodation, which made his Troops less careful to prevent correspondency: But the Town finding it could not hold out long against so strong a Siege, gave private intelligence to the Citizens of Sardis , who (apprehending the loss would absolutely turn to their ruine, since the King would be sure (as they believed) after to imploy the rest of his endeavour in their subversion, when he should have finished the design in hand, that onely opposed him) of a sudden sent out under the command of Dimogoras , the Souldiers of Sardis it self, that until then were never known to remove many furlongs from the smoke of their own Chimneyes, to try if it were possible to raise the Kings Siege; who with as quick an expedition as they were able, marched towards the Camp, imagining that the success of this voyage was to determine their fates, whether to remain free Citizens, or become conquered slaves. Euarchus on the other side when he heard of this new and unexpected supply, so much contrary to his imagination, however rumours thereof had formerly come to his ears, thought it his best course, rather to fight with them in the open Fields, then in continuing in his Trenches, to hazzard the danger of being starved for want of provision: With these purposes, after he had quitted the Walls of the Town, he advanced towards their Quarters with a hope to set upon them in the plain Champain, since he conceived he had much the advantage of Horse, though his Foot was of a far less number. But though the King omitted no industry to compass his design, yet being betrayed by the common people in his intelligence who ever favoured the Senate more then their Sovereign, Dimogoras got some dayes journey towards the City of Sardis , before Euarchus knew of his remove; the design of the General being no other now he had freed the City from danger, but to get again safe with his whole Army to the place from whence he came: The King as he was enraged with this secret escape, so was he resolved if it were possible to fight with him upon any terms, since the contrary as he imagined, would prove in the opinion of the multitude, of no less a consequence, then a Victory obtained by his adversaries: To that effect as soon as he had overtaken his Enemies by tedious marches, he set upon them with desperate inconveniencies; not onely for that they had locked themselves in inclosed Countries, but never came out of their Trenches to skirmish, by which means the Kings Cavalry proved of no service; so that as I may say by reason of these unfortunate disadvantages, Euarchus after twelve hours fight could pretend but to a very small Victory; which success returned Dimogoras to the City of Sardis with some honour, in regard, that however he had not beat the Kings Forces, it might be said upon the matter he had worsted his designs. Nevertheless, although this gave the Generals party not onely encouragement for the present, but hopes in abundance in the future; especially for that the Kings Souldiers every where began both to be negligent and treacherous; more seeming to rely upon the supposed justness of the Cause, then resolving constantly to defend it by any hazzard; yet the Senate at Sardis doubting something their own fortune or success, notwithstanding what policy soever they could use in the Kings Camp, resolved again to bring in the Myssians into Lydia with a powerful Army: To this purpose they made a contract with them, not onely to pay them a very great sum of money, both to defray their charges and reward their endeavours, but also promised to establish in the Kingdom of Lydia it self, the same manner of Worship of the Gods as was practised in Myssia: As this seemed in effect to be the whole agreement between them, so the Myssians wanted not in their meaning underhand designs, which was to bear at leastwise an equal share in the Government of both Kingdoms, whereby the better to satisfie their pride and avarice; when as for the latter (as 'twas said) they would have sold the Gods themselves, if they had been upon the earth vendible. By this means again Euarchus became involved in new troubles; for presently after the Myssians having made this unhandsome accord to the Kings disadvantage, notwithstanding their so many vows and promises to the contrary, there was imployed at the same time an Ambassadour from the Kingdom of Syria to Euarchus , not onely to perswade him to entertain a new Treaty and friendship with his Senate, sitting at Sardis , but also absolutely to break all correspondency and friendship between himself and the State of Egypt ; which if condescended unto by the King, he undertook, as well to keep back the Myssians from entring Lydia , as to settle an absolute peace in all the rest of his Dominions: Whether these were onely brags or no, is altogether uncertain; rather may it be thought, either the Kings Fate or unhappy Councel, ever thrust him on upon those wayes, that were most prejudicial to his Affairs: In conclusion he did not onely deny the Ambassadour the least entertainment of these propositions, but at the same time also was perswaded, to publish a Declaration against the City of Sardis , though at present it seemed to contend with the Senate, about the payment of that money promised to the Myssians , in recompence for their expedition into Lydia . This I must needs say so much exasperated the Town, that presently they went on with their accord by the general consent of all: When these summs were received presently the Myssians marched into the Countrey with a huge Army, whilst another was sent with Dimogoras against the Kings own person: As by this means Euarchus was constrained to divide his Forces, so did he send the greatest part of his Army along under the command of Thyasmus his Nephew, for the necessary raising of the Siege before the City of Theatyra , where the Myssians were already incamped; however their power was increased, with such Troops, as the Senate had commanded to joyn with them in that service: Prince Thyasmus upon his approach (whether being as I may say too precipitate in his conduct, or that he was betrayed absolutely in his intelligence) when he came near the Town, thinking either to surprize or defeat the enemy in an instant, of the contrary suddenly he became involved in a most desperate Ambuscado, which in a manner destroyed the persons or the courages of his whole Army, though in truth the Myssians performed the least part of the service: But the King being followed and furiously attempted in his march (as I said) by Dimogoras , he kept himself and Troops (though fewer by many in number) upon such sure and courageous grounds, that the General at last was brought into so many desperate inconveniencies, by reason of his want of conduct and providence, that although Euarchus at that time fought not one stroke, he forced him to compound for the lives and liberties of all his Souldiers, which was an occasion that presently the Senate turned Dimogoras out of his office, whilst in the interim there was put into his place one Farezius , whose melancholly valour in a very short time prevailed exceedingly; for that the Myssians had caused the King to divide his Forces into so many several commands, that he could not conveniently maintain a considerable body together under any Captain, to be able to contend with power sufficient; wherefore after some councel taken with his best friends, the King resolved himself in person, to endeavour to stop the fury of this new and prevailing General, that seemed like an outrageous torrent, to carry all before him, whether he marched against Towns or Armies. The King besides the inflammation of his own natural courage, was put on to fight with Farezius , as 'twas thought upon these reasons: First to prevent a conjunction between him and the Myssians , who were as yet at some distance: Next to continue a life in his own party that seemed something to decline his assistance in many places of the Kingdom, in regard of the others extraordinary success: And last of all, for that both money and other provisions failing, he began to contract many necessities in his Army. It was not long before they both met upon a large plain in an open Countrey, that afforded room enough for an equal contention, if the Fates had at all proved indifferent in the encounter: The first charge was given with fury sufficient by both sides, however the Kings Horse without any known cause whatsoever, of a sudden gave back, and not long after most shamefully turned their backs, though the Foot with incredible gallantry, still continued the Fight with honour and safety: Euarchus upon this (however not being so much amazed as displeased) presently rid amongst the flying Troops; as it were calling both Gods and men to witness, concerning the justness of his Cause, and the unfainedness of his intentions; withal perswading them either to shew more courage or less disloyalty: Also not onely in his words, but by his own unexampled courage, evidently expressed before their faces, conjured them to fight, or at leastwise to stand their ground at some distance, whilst he and the rest exposed their lives to the fury of the Enemy; calling them sometimes his Countreymen and Subjects; otherwhile he termed them no better then unworthy slaves, that precipitately followed their own destruction and captivity; when as they had a fair occasion offered them to be both glorious and happy: but at last, seeing nothing would prevail, he looked up to Heaven with tears in his eyes, beseeching that the Gods would take pitty on him in his necessities; at leastwise prove propitious to the Monarchy of Lydia , that seemed absolutely to depend upon this dayes adventure: Thus between praying, fighting, and perswading, he continued, until he saw most of his Souldiers either taken or slaughtered: so that at last, being constrained with a very few number in his company to quit the Field, he left his Camp to the courtesie of the Enemies mercy, whilst by obscure passages he got again safe in person (though much in his thoughts dejected) to the strong Town of Phyladelphia , where not long after by the whole power of Farezius , he was besieged with the rest of his Court, Friends, and Family. As this, said he, was the proceeding of that fatal day, so may I suppose by the dispersing of the most part of the company, it will be also time for us to retire: so taking Narcissus by the hand, he promised he should have the rest of his discourse at home. His house was seated at the end of a small Town onely divided by a pleasant grove of wood, that encompassed a round Temple built with Ionick Columns; within which was the statue of Apollo: when they had performed some few devotions, according to the manner of the Countrey, amongst other Priests of their own order, that remained in the place, the old Father led him to his habitation: being entered into the Parlour, he presently shewed him the picture of Euarchus ; which for some time he had kept, as he said, in an obscure corner of his house, though now he seemed to expect more freedom; and thereupon he began to read a Lecture concerning his life and disposition: which gave him an appetite to discourse in this manner. The Father of Euarchus our now King, being a Prince wholly given, as I may say, to his own pleasure, onely studied wayes to keep himself during his life in a quiet security; and to this purpose, he not onely brought up his son, after the death of his elder brother in learning and domestick exercises, under the protect of his own eye and jurisdiction, but when he came to years of consent, he endeavoured with some violence, to marry him to the King of Egypts Daughter, by whose greatnesse he thought to establish his own Regal Power the better in Lydia , perceiving his Subjects were apt enough upon all occasions, to kick against his authority: but finding the Treaty was protracted, he sent his son in person with an intimate favourite of his, into Africa , to court the young Lady. To be short, the journey produced no effects at all answerable to his desires; for the two favourites of each Prince clashing together, although a certain day was appointed for the Marriage, yet the match broke, though upon what grounds I neither know, or can well dispute: After this breach Euarchus made presently his address to Hyacinthia our now Queen, being sister to Orsames King of Syria , esteemed a most mortall enemy to the greatness of the Kingdom and Monarchy of Egypt: no sooner was this match concluded, but the old King died, leaving young Euarchus to inherit in outward appearance, as much glory and prosperity as was possible to be enjoyed by mortality upon earth; and so continued for many years, until these late unhappy differences obstructed his felicity: which truly I must the rather bewail, in regard that he is a Prince given to no manner of vice; however perhaps some will say, he is more beholding to nature for his inclination, then to resolution for his temperance; unto which I answer, that as the world ought not to take any notice of the inward thoughts of man, when people receive a general commodity by the outward expressions of vertues; so of the other side, when good and laudable actions are accompanied with an entire justice in appearance, it is unpossible but either the gods have placed such upon earth, to become rare examples for imitation to others, or else have ordained them to be extreamly beneficial to themselves; so that both wayes he deserves singular countenance and preservation; and this without any partiality, may be said to be the right character of the disposition of Euarchus : for his active parts, that are and have been obvious to all the world; no man can accuse him of cruelty, pride, or injustice: his dear affections to his wife and children, are beyond the pattern of all his predecessors; his activity and solicitation almost not to be imitated by any: his moderation in Diet and Apparrel scarce equals the poorest of his Subjects: if his parcimony can be imputed to him for a fault, let his numerous issue, and the small extent of his own Revenues, make for him at leastwise a probable, if not a sufficient excuse: besides and over and above these specified vertues, I must commend his discreet valour, and entire patience, since as in the one he never declined any engagement, when the necessity of his fortune did any way stand in need of the demonstration of his courage, so did he never yet appear overcome by passion, when he tasted the greatest bitterness of what affliction soever: With these words the Priest, as if he had been transported with the very apprehension of his suffering, seemed to end his discourse both in tears and sighs; and certainly had so continued for a long space, in a certain kinde of extasie, if an old woman and a little youth (the whole family with himself of his private habitation) had not interrupted his sorrowful contemplation, by bringing into the Parlor Wine and other junkets to entertain Narcissus ; who notwithstanding, after he had tasted sufficiently of that civility, put him in minde again of his promised relation, which was to make an end so far of his information, concerning King Euarchus fortunes, that he might be instructed, in the reasons of the joyful assembly of the people, dancing about the Altar and Statue of God Pan . The Priest, after he had acknowledged in some sort, his own digressions from the matter intended, he let him know; that as it was no part of his meaning to deprive him of his due, according to his own obligation, so he desired him to excuse his passion in the Kings behalf, occasioned onely by the sight of the picture, that suddenly brought into his minde, a certain kinde of representation of his heroical vertues, proceeding from his nature and education: Whereupon presently leading Narcissus into his Garden, furnished him with many dainty flowers of all sorts, in which curiosity he seemed to take an extraordinary delight, at last they both seated themselves in one of the Arbours, neatly contrived to defend the inward part of the habitation from Phoebus oppression; which afforded a sufficient conveniency for discourse, and that joyned with the opportunity, quickly entered him into his new relation after this manner. Euarchus , said he, being as I told you retired to Philadelphia after the Battle, as soon as he came into the Town, he went presently to his Garden without speaking one word to any person, although many Troops followed him with passion, to know some particulars concerning his fortunes; the rather for that they conceived themselves also to be sufficiently interested in his fate: There he walked with a quick pace according to his custom, sometimes casting his arm abroad, and otherwhiles again beating his breast with no small violence; then would he look up to the Heavens, as if a little he accused the Gods determinations, to suffer him that intended nothing but justice and goodness, to be so cruelly persecuted by his own Subjects, without any known cause whatsoever; so that in truth the whole company with tears in their eyes, began more to consider his inward sufferings, then their own outward state and condition: Thus I say he continued, until Prince Thyasmus his unfortunate Nephew (who not long before had retired thither with his beaten and scattered Troops) came also with a few attendants in the Garden: When he had saluted the King with a sad look, (walking with him in that manner two or three turns) he at last, humbly desired him, to let the company understand a little of his unfortunate passages, since they could not be worse (as he said) then they imagined them to be, and for ought they knew they might be better then they supposed: The King went presently and seated himself upon a Bench, whilst all the company flockt about him, though he onely made a discourse to them in this nature. Gentlemen, said he, you now behold Euarchus tumbled from his Throne: It is apparent the Gods are displeased with our actions; neither do I well know, what will become of this unfortunate Kingdom; for however they punish and demonstrate their indignation oftentimes by evil and wicked instruments, yet they never shew their displeasure and indignation, but where offences are apparent enough to deserve that chastisement: Whether these faults (for which for the present we are scourged) abound most in my own Court, or the poison hath too much dilated it self over all my dominions, I will not say; onely sure we are, that sins of all sorts are increased in such a measure, that it is probable the Gods no longer could abstain from demonstrating the very height of their fury and wrath: I could be contented to suffer for you all, so that would be sufficient to pay the score of our obligations, we owe the Heavens justice for our crimes; but I fear me we are designed to be more generally involved, whereby to satisfie the divine exasperated indignation, who can be no more couzened in its knowledge then restrained in its power: In my opinion the best way is, instantly to take asunder by way of profitable consideration, all our particular actions and thoughts; and so by wholsome and true repentance, if it be possible, to give some stop to the furious torrent of our misfortunes, before they come to such a Sea of confusion, that necessarily a general destruction must follow: When I consider the pride, covetousness, and dissimulation of my own Family and Court, I am partly convinced in my thoughts, that the ills we have suffered, wholly proceed from that original: Again, when I look upon the disobedience, luxury, and atheisme of the whole Kingdom, I may suppose from the peoples impieties have come our misfortunes: If I have been to blame for either, I must rather implore the Gods pardon for my omissions, then overmuch accuse my own intentions that made them so; since however my nature may be too passively indulgent in such particulars, yet my disposition was not at all, prone to give them allowance and approbation: I must confess I cannot altogether free my self from every imputation, that hath been cast upon my Government; for it is no small fault to be remiss in punishments, where crimes may be encouraged to example; though much more when countenanced in oppression: And where inferiour Officers are permitted, though not commanded to be unjust, the Prince ought to bear a share in the active part, for that he had the power to have restrained the mischief, which perhaps is the occasion of my present suffering, with the rest of my Subjects, and what more indignation the Gods have in store, I cannot be certain to prevent; onely I am confident, without a deep examination of our inward thoughts, the conscience will not be sufficiently understood, whereby to be clear in any kinde to purpose, however our principles may be right and good; for without it, neither sorrow nor satisfaction can follow of any considerable value, to blot out the remembrance of such evils; and so consequently a continuation of the punishment due to the nature of our offences, will not be taken away. It is not enough to say our enemits want justice and legality in their prosecution, for that they may be made for the present onely divine revengers, though themselves be reserved for higher and more exemplary torments; for however actions of prosperity and success, be not alwayes marks of favour and approbation, yet ought they justly be esteemed testimonies of distaste against those Nations, and such persons, that unfortunately are rendred Subjects of misery and chastisement, since none ever suffers without a cause: When revolutions happen (if we would but seriously enough look after the reason) in the general, we should finde matter sufficient to convince our belief, that we are not totally innocent almost in any particular; for the Gods are oftentimes accustomed to preserve the whole, for their sakes that may pretend justly to any thing extraordinary: No my friends, this Kingdom hath been for some years past, involved in too much superfluity, to expect long a continuation of their felicity; which no doubt made us too unmindful from whence proceeds originally all good and commodity: When peace and tranquility exceedingly abound in any region, without being at all bridled and restrained by voluntary temperance and consideration, there is nothing to be expected soon after but captivity or destruction, to recal again mens thoughts and actions to moderation, necessary for a new settlement and preservation: This world was created but as the tryer and touch-stone of our dispositions, for the better establishment of our eternal condition hereafter, since otherwise certainly it had not been made at all: In this consists the onely mistake of mankinde, that we look at present, and essential acquisitions belonging properly to our persons, without any relation to the future, when as they are I say intended either as accidental benefits, or natural consolations, necessary in some sort for our temporary subsistance: If we be great, mighty, and prosperous, we expect ease, pleasure, and observance, as meer duties that should attend us, instead of making our thoughts thereby become more grateful, humble, and solicitous in all our endeavours, not onely to augment vertue and purchase grace, but to distribute our endeavours also by charity and reason, to those that are more indigent upon earth: What a King or Commander hath in honour and power, should be imployed in care and industry for the general good: And if a begger or inferiour person wants in riches and prosperity, it ought to be supplied by being free from hazzard and perturbation: By which means all sorts of people may participate in a kinde of an equality, according to the intention of their first creation, since the Gods certainly intended no absolute difference but what their inscrutable decrees have determined in the future, answerable to the endeavours of every one in particular: For however the things belonging to this life, sometimes may vary by way of accident in the world, yet the reasonable and more noble part of man, should be alike free in every one of us, by the same rule of estimation and pretension, This consideration makes me at present, look upon my self and you in this common misery, with the same eyes of pitty and commiseration: Wherefore being determined to call my own thoughts to a most strict account, what I have acted, and how I may suffer; so would I have you also examine your consciences, wherein you have offended; and in what nature you may be remedied by this means, if it be yet possible, to procure some mercy from the Gods in our pressing necessities: and these I say are intentions, not onely most pious but extream safe. With these words he instantly rose from his seat, and retired into his private Chamber, that not onely forced tears but occasioned discourse from most of the company. But whilst the King, and the inhabitants of Philadelphia with despairing thoughts, were busily imployed about the better fortifying of the Town, against the expected Siege of Farezius , who every day was looked for with his Troops to attempt the same, (though most part of them intended, rather to mend their conditions by yielding at last upon milder terms, then entertained in their hopes any probability of prevailing against his Forces) of a sudden the Myssians , fearing, lest they might be deceived in their expectations, both in the money they expected from the Senate, as also concerning an equal share in the Government of the Kingdom of Lydia , for that they had procured to themselves and Nation in the Battle, rather contempt for the little valour they had shewed, then any way gained credit in the Wars, besieged another Town belonging to the Kings party, not yet reduced under the Senates jurisdiction; where however they had continued for some weeks, yet at length they were beaten off both with loss and disgrace; insomuch as then not knowing well how to play their Cards with any advantage, they began as their last refuge, not onely publickly to dispute the Kings Titles, whom as they pretended the Senate had oppressed beyond their intentions; but imployed the interest of a certain Ambassadour of Syria in their Army, to perswade Euarchus , if it were possible to make an escape from the City of Philadelphia , whereby to put his person into their hands, promising in the interim his hopes, both present safety and future prosperity; as people being (as they said) his own native Countreymen, who intended his condition, nothing but good and advantage by their assistance, according to his own desire. The King having received this comfortable message, which pretended a lucky Omen as he imagined to the rest of his occasions, notwithstanding Farezius had newly besieged Philadelphia , one day he called me privately into his Bed-chamber: when he had made fast the door with a certain kinde of extraordinary earnestness in his countenance, according to the manner he used in any thing he went about (being in truth a Prince, that is not onely solicitous in his thoughts, but indefatigable in his pains and actions) he told me, that as he had a secret of much consequence to impart unto me, so was he affraid lest it should come to the knowledge of any, that were not intended to be imployed in the business; doubting he had so many Traytors attending about his person, that it was impossible almost, for any design to be put in execution, without the Senates privity and knowledge: Wherefore though he were sufficiently confident (as he said) of my fidelity, by reason of the long experience he had had of my service, and the tryal he had experimented of my Honesty and Religion; yet for that one or two more, were necessarily to be used in the same adventure, he resolved to exact from me, not onely my faithful promise, but a Religious Oath, concerning the performance of my trust tending to his commands: After I had assured him by verbal protestations, that I would be ready to lay down my life, in any thing his Majesty should think me capable, either of acting or suffering for his advantage, he made me presently kneel down before the Statue of Jupiter , which he had alwayes standing in his Chamber; where most solemnly I renewed those undertakings: After which he discovered unto me his designs; which was in a disguised habit, to pass through Farezins Camp in my Company, and so privately to convey himself into the Myssian Army, whither as he told me he had been lately envited, with assurance of their assistance, towards his prosperity and protection: Although I must confess I was not much enamoured of the project, knowing the base esteemed falshood of that people; yet lest the King might suspect any unwillingness in my disposition, to hazzard my person in his service, I durst neither open my thoughts, or deliver my opinion, although perhaps I might have shewed him some reasons, that would have procured alteration; however I knew of the other side, his straits and necessities were sufficiently pressing in regard of the Siege, to cause him almost to venture upon what desperate design whatsoever: In conclusion I undertook to provide within three dayes space, both horses and other conveniencies to that purpose, whilst the King in the interim writ a Letter, with some few directions to his Nephew Prince Thyasmus , whom he had lately made Governour of Philadelphia ; which was to render the Town to the Enemy, after such a time mentioned, though with the best conditions he could make for himself, a consideration also being had both of his Court and Friends: Besides he directed other writings to his eldest Son Arethusius , who remained then in the farthest part of the Kingdom, attended by some few Forces of his own, wishing him to transport himself with all expedition to his Mother the Queen, to whose commands he conjured him to be obsequious, in every thing that concerned all their affairs; she being in truth not onely a Lady he loves beyond measure; but whose birth and interest may procure him assistance out of Syria . To be short, within three dayes time I had provided all things so necessary for the Kings journey, that he was clothed after the manner of the Grecian slaves, who are accustomed to be imployed about servile works in the Field, onely he had over his under apparel, a blue Mantle with short and large sleeves: He wore upon his head a high Bonnet in colour red, with three or four Feathers taken from a Cocks tail; upon his legs were fastned certain black Buskins of Leather, with Buckles. Betimes in the morning, we issued out of the Town both on horseback, my servant riding before a great bag, that was oyled all over to prevent the prejudice of rain; since I had put some necessary accommodations for our voyage therein; however nothing at all that could be any way suspicious, although it might be our fortunes to be taken by the Enemy, which in truth so fell out accordingly: For passing through the first watch, we were not onely commanded to stand, the Souldiers presently demanding of us from whence we came, but also as suspicious persons, were carried before an Officer of the Army to be examined: I did not deny but that I came out of the Town of Philadelphia ; however I told them, that as I was onely there by accident, to visit some friends and dispatch other necessary businesses, with certain Schollers that lived in the Academy, who meddled with nothing but what concerned their Studies, so was I again repairing to the City of Sardis , where for the most part I remained; being by profession a Priest, that observed the Myssian Rites, in my ordinary sacrificing to the Gods. This smooth tale I had hoped would have freed me presently; yet they kept us all that day and the next night, with a pretension the General was not at leasure, without whose discharge and allowance (as they said) we could neither pass, or be at liberty: 'Tis true, their chief intention was to get money from us; but I must confess I durst not over-bountifully offer them any, in regard it would have given the more occasion of jealousie and suspicion: nevertheless, notwithstanding they seemed to detain me as a prisoner, yet I got leave for my servant, to be in some sort free in the Camp, whereby to have the conveniency (as I pretended) to provide some accommodation, necessary for the Horses; who in that office performed his duty so diligently, that I must tell you he was constrained all night to lye in the open Field, without any coverture whatsoever over his body, though in truth it proved to be a very tempestuous season: In this manner we were perplexed between fear and suffering, however I must confess I little doubted the Kings discovery; not onely in respect of his habit, but that he had also shaved his beard in a most antick fashion. In conclusion the good humour of the General the next day, or rather the Souldiers finding there was but little to be got from us, not onely discharged me from my further attendance, but gave a Pass for me and my servant, to travel freely to the City of Sardis , without any let or hinderance from any of their party; which proved to be of no small conveniency unto us in all our journey: for although the protection onely mentioned that Town, where we least intended to go, yet as soon as I was out of the Camp, I so finely mended the writing with my own pen, that I made it most aptly serve for every place and Region: Insomuch, as by reason thereof, in our journey we were neither letted nor troubled to any purpose; having a discharge presently amongst all manner of Officers of theirs, as soon as we produced the paper; when as without doubt otherwise, we had been infallibly taken and imprisoned, since those parts where we travelled, were become extream suspicious by order from the Senate, in regard of the Declarations of the Myssians , of purpose so commanded, the better as they thought to prevent all intercourse and correspondency, between the Kings party and the people of that Nation. In this manner at last we arrived in the Myssian Camp, and with a great satisfaction (I must needs say) to the Kings thoughts, however his resolutions were not presently to discover his person: so that retiring into a little Village not very far from the Army, he sent me (after I had taken some small refreshment) to enquire for the Syrian Ambassadour, upon whose score he rather seemed to have put his undertaking this dangerous adventure, then upon any absolute confidence he could have in the Myssians fidelity, in regard that they had already so often deceived him, with their fair promises and false actions; it was my part also in complements to tell him as much, when I had made him acquainted with the Kings arrival. As the Ambassador appeared somewhat amazed at the news, so did he not stick to assure me, that he knew his Majesty would be received by the Army with all honour and safety, and presently went along with me to finde him out, where the King after some few civilities, used this language to the Ambassadour. Sir, said he, as you now see me in a posture far below my birth and dignity, so the Gods, to let us know we are but men, have for the present suited my person according to my misfortunes, whereby to comply the better with my necessities; this I hope is sufficient to shew, what a desire I have to put my self into the hands of my native Countreymen: If either the consideration of my past benefits bestowed upon them in the general, or any compassionate reflection upon my unfortunate state at the instant, are motives sufficient to work upon humanity, I shall be safe here, and may be prosperous hereafter; wherefore, as I would not have them to work upon my miseries, for poor and contemptible gain, so shall not I remember them any more of their former ingratitude and disobedience; but rather let us both unite in such a constant conjunction, that as by their means I may come again to be King, so will they ever by such an act of kindeness oblige me to govern for their benefit: they cannot but consider with what little probability they can hope for any establishment in Lydia , but by my means, when as already the Senate, doth not onely disvalue their actions and proceedings by most disgraceful and contemptible speeches, but now that they have brought (as they believe) their affairs to a prosperous issue, (whereby they have no more need of their assistance, and so consequently would be rid of the trouble) they not onely dispute with them, the titles, and reasons of their own Interest, but even deny them the payment of their just due, for all those services they have performed to their advantages in Lydia . As the Ambassadour did not make any great reply to the Kings discourse, but in a few complements, concerning his own services, so did he presently conduct him to his house for his better accommodation; where he gave present order, to have him furnished with apparel, and other necessaries, whilst in the interim (as it was supposed) he acquainted Lycius the General, and the rest of the Officers of the Army, with his arrival in the Camp: After two or three dayes time, the Ambassadour not onely exposed the King to the view of the people, but delivered him into the protection of the souldiers; where however Lycius and some of the principall of the Nobility, entertained his presence with an extraordinary outward humility; yet nevertheless with certain kinde of sad and distrustful looks and countenances, they performed their duties and respects in kissing his hands, and using other ceremonies, as if they were not any way privy, much less consenting to his journey: The King, notwithstanding he seemed not to take any notice of their actions in publick, but of the contrary gave testimonies of joy and gladness, at the apprehension of his happy fortune; yet in private, by many words and sighs, he expressed his own doubts and opinion concerning his future entertainment; the rather, in regard they presently set a strict guard upon his person, though pretending it to be done for no other end, but for his greater honour and safety; however his hopes became something better satisfied, for that they admitted freely to his conversations, not onely many of his houshold servants that were come from Philadelphia , after the Town was surrendred to Farezius , but some of those Priests also of his own faction, that were under the jurisdiction of the Flamins . In this manner the King remained for divers weeks, delighting his thoughts with such recreations, as had been almost made customary to his nature, by continuall practice from his infancy, which made not a few wonder, how he could seem pleased with such trivial things in the height of his vexations and discontents. Again, it was spitefully laid to his charge by his adversaries, that he had no great prejudice in being tumbled from his Throne, when as he appeared not to have apprehension enough, to be sufficiently sensible of what consequence the loss of a Kingdom was; but probably either he had so much wisdom, as to reflect upon the uncertainty of all worldly things with a right consideration, or was endued with such a supream goodness in his disposition, as perswaded him to bear his afflictions, with no ordinary temper and pacification. In the interim the Myssians were not idle, to play their game to the best advantage, both with the Senate and the King; for as of one side they made the Senate believe, they had a minde to dispute the Kings injuries and sufferings, both out of Honour and Religion, so did they alwayes tell the King, that he must give satisfaction to the demands of either Kingdom, before they could become instrumentall in his establishment; which drew on their consultations to the length of many weeks expectation, the Senate urging the delivering of the Kings person into their possession, out of right and justice, in regard they had been onely hired in the wars and service of Lydia by their money; wherefore consequently they were obliged with a punctual decorum, to observe their commands in every thing. Of the other side, Euarchus party affirmed; that he being King of Myssia , as well as Lydia , the Myssians ought to have as particular an interest in his person and preservation, as the Senate of Lydia ; in prosecution of which they were to see him again restored to his Crown and Dignity, notwithstanding any desire to the contrary: but whilst these disputations lasted, as I my say, with some seeming bitterness of either side, which as 'twas thought, would instantly have caused a cruel and bloody war between both Nations, one Argilius a Nobleman of Myssia came suddenly from his own Countrey into the camp, who from the very beginning of the stirs had been a main opposer (by reason of his own covetousness and ambition) of the Kings interest in that Nation; intending thereby more absolutely to govern all the Affairs of that Kingdome himself: When he arrived he presently went to the Councel of the Army, where he made this Oration. Gentlemen, said he, I understand you are now assembled about those consultations, that may belong to the Kings particular concernments; partly proceeding from the earnest solicitation of the Syrian Ambassador; and partly in regard Euarchus is now present amongst you in the Camp: In my opinion it is more just and convenient, in the first place to look upon the Gods Worship, as in the next to minde our own preservations: to this purpose it ought to be considered, why we took up Arms at all in the beginning, to oppose our Prince, if now without any other condition whatsoever we should lay them down, and again restore him to his ancient dignity, without condition? I pray, remember we have made a solemn protestation to the Gods, as of the other side a confederation with our friends; and if we break with both, no doubt but heaven and earth will accuse us as well of perjury as indiscretion; since we should seem, neither to reverence sacred things as we are bound, nor preserve humane obligations as we ought: May you not remember, we took from our King his power for no other reason, but because we thought him not fit to reign over us, accompanied with his stubborn and wilful crimes; and shall we presently restore him to that State again without amendment? Are we not tied by promises to the Senate of Lydia , faithfully to perform their businesses in these Wars, whilst we are under their pay and jurisdiction? And shall we detain the very object of their intentions against their mindes, as a protected person by our Army, who was the onely booty they aimed at to purchase by our endeavours? O horrid injustice and more pernicious indiscretion, since in the one undoubtedly we exasperate the Gods anger, as in the other we apparently endanger our own safeties; for as they cannot but revenge their own dishonour in the highest fury of their wrath, in regard of our perjury, so justly may the people of Lydia over-run our Kingdom, for not performing those conditions we contracted for, before we entered their Countrey; which however it may be a war of some long contention and dispute, yet the effects must needs be bloody and expenceful; whereas, if we go hand in hand with our friends, (I mean the great Senate at Sardis ) we shall not onely preserve such an amity, as probably will make both Nations happy, but for the present fill our Coffers with sufficient Gold, to render us in Myssia , equally rich with other Countreys of Asia . By releasing the King I say without their consent, we give him onely power and conveniency, instead of being grateful for the benefit, to punish us for having been at the first the chief occasion that made him at all stand in need of such a kindness: this disposition of his hath been sufficiently experimented in his necessities, when as he will not so far gratifie us, as to put the Flamius out of the Temples: These reasons being considered, I say, let us presently dispatch messengers to the Senate of Lydia , with full power and commission from this Army, not onely to treat of conditions, but to conclude with that Councel, concerning those conditions and Articles which shall be thought fit to be offered to the King to confirm, either before he be restored to his Crown, or released from his imprisonment; so shall we be pious to the Gods, just to our friends, and beneficial to our selves. Although there was much contradiction, and strong disputes concerning this Oration of Argilius ; yet in regard Lycius the General, with many others of his Faction, in the Councel, were against the Kings desires, an absolute determination was presently there taken, to send Argilius with some other Commissioners to the City of Sardis , whereby to conclude such propositions, as should be held most advantageable as they said for both Nations; though it was well known the Myssians had onely an intention to good themselves; not onely in the payment of that money, which they expected from the Senate, but in regard of their secret intentions by Euarchus suppression, to have an equal share in the government of the Kingdom of Lydia: but however they concluded, to put in execution their resolution with all expedition, yet they still kept the King in hopes by fair promises of his restoration, as well to couzen and deceive his expectation, that he might not entertain new thoughts or fall upon other Counsels, as that he might not be irreconcileably distasted with their actions, if they should miss of their agreement with the Senate of Sardis ; who they doubted might be something unwilling, to part with those vaste summes that were demanded; which failing, they intended to make use both of the Kings titles and countenance, to prosecute their other designs, either in Lydia it self, or any other part of Asia , as there should be occasion. The Propositions they offered to the Senate were these: First, that the solemn protestation formerly agreed upon, should be taken by every person of both Nations without exception, out of which not the King himself to be exempted: secondly, not onely the jurisdiction, but the very name of the Flamius , to be absolutely abolished, and no other rites and manner of worship of the Gods to be used, but according to the customs of Myssia: Thirdly, that both Euarchus and his posterity were so far to be disinabled in their authority, that each Senate in both Kingdoms, might be sufficiently confident of their power, whereby to be freed in their own opinions, from all danger and suspition in the future: Fourthly, that such sums of money should speedily be paid to the Myssians as was promised for their satisfaction; and lastly, Commissioners to be chosen out of either Countrey, to whom the common transaction of affairs should be equally committed. Although these two latter Articles were something disputed, yet it was not long before it was agreed, that these conditions being presented, and the King refusing to subscribe them, he should be detained as a Prisoner, and not acknowledged for a Prince: Argylius and the rest returning to the Camp, (where the King, to be short, refusing his subscription and consent) within a very few weeks employed for the circumstances necessarily belonging to every performance, Euarchus was by the conduction of some Troops of Horse, delivered into the custody of Farezius , who presently conveighed him with his own Souldiers to a fair house formerly belonging to the Kings of Lydia: Of the other side, both Argylius and Lycius marched into their own Countrey of Myssia , with money and triumph, as if they had deserved immortal fame, for their disloyalty, which for the present must end my doleful story, since the time of the day invites us to take part of a slender supper, according to the warning of the little Bell I hear; however before you go to bed, I engage my self to furnish you with another relation, much more pleasing to my thoughts, that occasioned the late meeting of the people in the Fields, with such expressions of joy as you beheld: so taking Narcissus by the hand, he led him into a pretty Room, where they found two or three dishes of meat newly set upon the Table, attended onely by the old woman and the youth. After they had given thanks to the Gods, within an hours space they ended their supper; the cloth being presently taken away, and some few other discourses of delight fittest for digestion past over, the Priest again began this new relation. Euarchus , said he, being thus entred as I told you into a new captivity, (though far more nobly used) was constrained to attend the coming of the Commissioners of the Myssians to Sardis , for the further disposure of his person and affairs: but in the interim the Souldiers, whether contrary to their custom and vocation, reflecting principally upon the miseries and afflictions of the King, or rather being willing to make that the ground or pretensions for their future intentions, whereby to quarrel with the Senate about their own discontents, in seeing the Myssians esteemed, and themselves neglected, not onely by degrees began to use the King gently, but openly to complain that themselves were so far from receiving rewards for their services, as that they had not been justly paid their wages; when as the Myssians , as they said, received great summes of money, for doing nothing else but running away, and betraying their King: also they seemed exasperated, to have them countenanced in setting up their manner of worship of the Gods, throughout all the Kingdom of Lydia , to the enslaving, as was urged, of the Nation in the free liberty of their consciences; when as the people of Lydia , according as had been promised them, could not exercise their own manner of worship: besides they seemed extreamly to repine that Myssian Governours should be joyned with those of Lydia it self, in the management of State affairs, that belonged properly onely to the Nation: neither did these discontented discourses end in this manner; for they daily assembled in private Counsels, to produce something for their advantages, though they yet knew not very well what either to demand or act; however these proceedings were soon brought to the knowledge of the Senate, who being jealous also of their own intentions, were a great deal the more fearful of any dangerous accidents; so that presently they sent messengers to the Army, though as 'twas said with intentions to perswade, yet with authority to command the Souldiers to a better obedience: but as these Officers were extreamly deceived in their expectations, concerning their own power and interest in the Camp, so were they forced with expedition to return to those that sent them, with some terrour in their countenances. As this for many dayes, caused sometimes distracted Councels, otherwhiles more peremptory discourses, so was it not over-long before the Senate, was saluted with a Declaration from the Souldiers, wherein they not onely taxed them, with want of justice and extream ingratitude to the Army, that had fought so many Battles, and shed so much blood for themselves and the priviledges of Lydia , but also presented their considerations with these following proposals, wherein they wisht to be speedily satisfied: First, that they might with all expedition, not onely be paid their just dues, but in a convenient time be farther rewarded according to their deserts: Secondly, that no part of the Army should be disbanded without their own consents: Thirdly, that such Laws and Decrees might presently be established, to assure the people of Lydia of their convenient liberties; and lastly, that the Worship of the Gods according to the Myssian Rites might not be imposed absolutely upon any person or condition. These demands being sent to the Senate by messengers of their own, that before never expected to be contradicted, much less circumscribed by any power whatsoever, began to think, that it would be now their safest way, rather for the present to endeavour to temper the Souldiers passion, then further either to tempt or hazzard their fury: To this purpose they returned back their messengers, with faithful or at leastwise feigned promises, that speedily they should receive satisfaction, according to their hearts content: Nevertheless the Army finding after some weeks expectation, that the Senate endeavoured, rather to deceive their expectations by sowing under-hand and private factions among the Souldiers, then that they intended really to perform in effect, any thing that was actually for their good, after they had as it were chosen Farezius as their Captain General for their priviledges, as well as the Senate had chosen him for the Wars, not onely seized presently upon most of the Magazines of the Kingdome, but also sent some Troops to take the King out of prison where he remained: Euarchus being a little amazed at this new and sudden attempt, as he could not well interpret their meaning, although 'tis probable he might like well enough of their actions, so at the first, did he make some stand at their proceedings; yet at last being perswaded of their fair intentions, and having of the other side assured them of his affection, they instantly carried him in a certain kinde of triumph, through most part of the Kingdom of Lydia , until at last they lodged him in a brave Castle of his own, where he now remains (as it is believed) with a great deal of satisfaction; and the rather for that (it being so given out) they do not onely in an honourable manner, suffer him to exercise his own Rites concerning the Worship of the Gods, with a free admittance of all companies to be entertained, with what conversation he pleaseth, but have lately invited him to send for the Queen and all his Children, who shall be as they say joyful witnesses of his being again established in his Throne and Dignity; and however they be something suspitious of the practices of the Commissioners of Myssia , and those belonging to that faction, lest they might perswade the Kings heart from the interest of the Souldiers, yet the better to give him satisfaction, concerning the opinion of his own liberty; neither they or any else are debarred either from his presence or communication; whilst of every-side they have promised the common people a happiness according to their expectations, both in their manner of worshipping the gods, as well as belonging to all other priviledges, that can possibly any way appertain unto their future condition. This in truth I must tell you, was the onely occasion of our assembly this day, not onely to thank the gods in the general for this appearing happy change, but also a little to exercise their ancient decorums in their Rural sports, in regard they had been for some time debarred from such playes, by the rigid severity of the Myssian customs; which as I told you had been brought into Lydia , by the Priests and others of that Nation, and at last was imposed upon the people, as an absolute injunction by the authority of the Senate: This being what I can say for your satisfaction, concerning the present affairs of the Kingdom, wherein I fear me I have too much offended in the general, by my long discourses, though upon the matter I do not see how they could have been well omitted in any particular, so I hope you will now give me leave to end. After that Narcissus had thanked him for the pains he had taken, and the favor himself had receiv'd, (having past away some time longer in other discourses upon the same subject) the Priest calling his boy to take the lights, he conducted Narcissus into his Chamber, where after a while, with some Court-complements, he left him to take his rest, promising in the morning to shew him his Library, as one of the best curiosities he could present him withall. It was not very early the next morning, that the Priest interrupted Narcissus , conceiving belike that his travel required something more then ordinary rest, though in that he was much deceived, for he was not accustomed to let pass much time, without thinking upon his dear Cloria: but at last coming into his chamber, he invited him according to his promise, to the sight of his Library. As in that place they turned over many books of divers kindes, so beholding amongst other things, Maps and Spheres of the world, they fell in divers discourses concerning the opinions of some in the Primitive age, that did not believe there were any Antipodes ; as also others again, that thought the Sun stood still, and the Earth turned round; besides, a third sort of people which would not believe, but that there was another world in the Moon. This gave occasion to the old Priest to say, that as he would not much trouble his thoughts with the disputation of those questions, since it could no way concern, either his present or future being, so was it an unanswerable argument for the immortality of the soul, that the Sun being of so vaste a greatness, and of so excellent a clarity, no way to be known or imagined, of what matter it was made of, could not in all reason but be created for a thing more worthy then it self; and that not appearing in this world, of necessity it must be the reasonable soul of man, and nothing else, which was at first ordained to be the object of such an intention, in regard that onely remaining here pretends to eternity, and so consequently more worthy then all other things. From this discourse, they fell to a disputation about the priviledge of Arms and Learning, which of both ought to have the greater prerogative in peoples esteem: Narcissus said, that as action was more noble then contemplation, since the one did but think what the other performed; so in all probability Arms was to be preferred before Letters, in that it created really the subject for the others employment: besides he said, that action did not onely nourish it self, but gave life to other things, as namely History, the worlds Looking-glass, and times Recorder: Again, the undergoing of dangers and difficulties, as he said, was a means to warm mens apprehensions, and desires with noble flames; whilst Learning in a more obscure way, did but hold it the best honour it could merit from posterity, to remember truly what other people did worthy of commendation; however perhaps it self was onely contented to lye drowned in a certain kinde of sensuality, pleased with an imagination, that coveted but to know those things perfectly, which it never intended at all to practise; since the Dignity of Crowns and Empires depended not upon the information of who possessed them, but in having the free dispose of such glories themselves, for the most part not to be compassed and enjoyed, but by active valour; when as Books did no otherwise then make relation of those passages, like Generals in triumphant Chariots after the Battle, shewing to the people what was deserved in the field; or rather representing an excellent Comedian, appareld in most glorious attire, that playes to the life without wounds, the part of him that acted nobly and dangerously against his enemy. Books I must confess, said he, are commodious pictures, to teach present times by predecessors examples, what men ought to do in their own persons; whereas by activity and arms, we are put in possession of the honour it self: The one, as I may say, being onely the shadow, that may in some sort satisfie a soul not sufficiently knowing or inflamed; like old people that repeat with delight their old stories in their youth, when they have no more power or will to act to any purpose; whereas the other continues us enjoying our own vertues, like a plentiful and flourishing Harvest, producing variety of new fruit to the industrious Husbandman. He further said, that Letters were onely useful in seasons of quiet, whereas arms could onely secure and protect learning at all times, to make it become profitable, for that mens unruly and preposterous courses and actions, were to be restrained and regulated, more by power then perswasion. This being said, Narcissus with a gentle smile, gave the Priest also occasion to shew his reasons. The Priest told him, as he hoped without offence he would give him leave to be of a contrary opinion, however he honoured sufficiently the profession of arms, so with a courteous smile he began the question also in this manner: Although I will not deny, said he, but my self to have been a souldier in my youth, yet I cannot but stand for the priviledge of the pen, according to reason and justice; wherefore as contemplation doth not destroy the exercise of the body, so of the other side, books render a man more capable to act with advantage, without which, attempts would not be much profitable, since mans life is too little a space to learn sufficiently, what were best to be done in many things: he said further, that Military Discipline it self, could not subsist to any prevailing purpose, without those rules and orders, which were before thought upon, and learned by method and instruction; for that it is not onely, the running precipitately into hazzards and dangers, that ought to render a person deservedly admired, though sometimes blindefold fortune crown the action or attempt with success; but rather, when as by a knowing valour, we have either prevented a mischief, or procured a victory, deserves estimation: A prudent and valiant General, said he, goeth not so much into the field to hazzard and destroy, as to preserve and overcome; which certainly cannot be so well effected, as by least slaughter, and most policy; for although Monarchies and Countreys are oftentimes conquered by force of arms and power, yet seldom without stratagems and prudence can they be long and quietly enjoyed, for want of good established Laws to maintain them in peace and security; Wars he affirmed resembled furious windes and storms that overthrow buildings, and productions, but order and quiet like good builders, or provident husbandmen, make up again the breaches to fairness and commodity; even as a rough and harsh hand may quickly disorder the strings of instruments, for want of sufficient skill, but it must be skilful Artists that make them sound delightful to the ear: A disorderly Commonwealth, said he, may sometimes necessarily be chastized with the sword, as dangerous putrifactions, which are to be cut away from the rest of the members, to save the whole body from perishing; yet good and knowing Government, must be alwayes applied as a salve to render the rest again whole and sound: In conclusion, said the Priest, a State or Kingdom may stand without war, but without learning it cannot possibly subsist; since Armies themselves, that are esteemed the very instruments of glorious acquisitions, must, to preserve their own being, much more to purchase them considerable success, be obliged punctually to observe those rules prescribed them in times of peace. To this discourse Narcissus onely replyed, since he had so well defended learning by learning, he had no reason any more, to endeavour by the sharp language of his tongue, to destroy the excellency of the subject. These and the like discourses at last carrying them to dinner, (which being finished, and the cloth taken away) of a sudden the Priest was whispered in the ear by the little youth: Narcissus civilly removed from his place to give them the more freedom of speaking: when he had done the Priest told him, that he was sent for by one Creses , a young Nobleman of Lydia , unto whom he had been formerly beholding, not onely for the saving of his Library, but for many other courtesies, during his being employed in the Senates service; who was just now (being come out of Syria ) arrived in the Town hard by, from whom he doubted not, as he said, but to have some relations of consequence, to which purpose he did intend to bring him along with him to supper: He farther informed him, that he had formerly enjoyned him to write the passages of these times, which gave his studies some daily exercise: with this he took his leave of Narcissus ; wishing him to think upon what employment he pleased in the interim, either in his Gardens, or amongst his Books. Narcissus after the Priest was gone, as he reflected upon Creses arrival, who might bring news out of Syria as he hoped, towards the establishing of Euarchus in his Throne, by which consequence he doubted not, but the sooner to come to the period of his own love; so of the other side did he resolve, upon his quitting suddenly the Priests house, to put himself under the command of the revolted Army, not knowing which other way to do his sweet Princess any considerable service; especially for that the King her Father, seemed now to be onely under the care and protection of the Souldiers: The next consideration that came into his minde was, by what means he might with the least suspicion, provide himself with Horse and Arms to that purpose; since he durst not discover his intention to the Priest, for fear of the more notice to be taken of his quality and condition: The whole afternoon in a manner he spent in these considerations, until the old Priest returned with Creses in his company; though yet he had not enformed him of any news at all concerning his Travels, by reason they had neither privacy or conveniency, in regard of the many visits and other complements they received from the Townsmen: As soon as Creses entered the room, the Priest made him acquainted with Narcissus , who was one, as he said, that belonged to the Countrey of Cyprus ; whereupon Creses replyed, that as his person merited in outward appearance, the best respect that could be given by all civil people of any Nation, so was he extream happy in the encounter, for that his Travels perhaps, might furnish him with something out of his own Countrey, if lately he had not heard from thence, of some consequence: After that Narcissus had returned him a sutable complement, both the Priest and himself seemed somewhat passionate to hear his relation, which quickly carried them all three to a convenient seat in the Garden, where Creses without much circumstance, used this discourse unto them, whilst their supper was preparing in the kitchin in the interim. As it is sufficiently known, said he, how unfortunately the Princess Cloria (after she was delivered out of the Castle by my self) was carried back again to the Senate, by the Treason of certain Souldiers fled from the Battle, which Prince Thyasmus lost to the Myssians , so will I onely begin my relation from my own quitting of Lydia upon that occasion: To which purpose you must know, that it being my intention in the first place to visit our Queen Hyacinthia , to inform her fully of all occurances in Lydia , since I was rendered by reason of that accident, altogether uncapable of other services any way beneficial, either to the Princess or her self; finding upon my arrival in the Island of Cyprus ; that the Queen was newly parted from thence, I had some leasure granted me to be enformed of the late strange news of that Island, which were delivered me in this manner: The passages I am the more willing to relate for the satisfaction of this stranger. The Dukes Daughter of that Countrey named Eretheria , one day walking by chance by the Sea-side with one attendant onely, near a certain kinde of Religious House, where she was retired for her Devotions, of a sudden casting down her eyes towards the bottom of the Rocks, she might see something lye, that however so far off she could not perfectly distinguish; nevertheless continuing her looks fixed for some time upon the object, which she thought according to the fancies of her imagination, not onely to be a body that had been cast up by the Sea, but that it also appeared to have some motion in it: So that there being in that place certain steps cut in the Stone, that afforded conveniency enough for descent, she resolved her self in person to make the experiment, whereby the better to satisfie her curiosity: Where being arrived with her Maid-servant, she soon perceived a handsome young man lying upon the Sands, with a piece of round Timber under his body, as it were infolded within one of his armes, whilst the other lay at some distance: This prospect however it something startled her thoughts, with a little kinde of horrour, yet her courage more prevailing then the natural fearfulness of her sex, as she approached nearer, the youth seemed to have some motion indeed, and this gave both her apprehension and charity a subject as she thought to work upon: Wherefore presently sending her attendant to call some Fishermen at a pretty distance, that were mending their Nets, she caused them presently to transport the youth to a small house by the Water-side, who in the interim began to recover more and more life. To be short, within awhile she applyed so many remedies with her fair hands to his distempers, that in a few dayes he was recovered from the greatest part of his danger, though not altogether out of the troublesomness of his sickness; which kept him in his bed for a very long season, though in a manner daily visited by the fair and charitable Eretheria ; not yet having yielded an account to any of the accident by Sea, that was the occasion of his being cast in that sort upon the shore: But finding at last, that he not onely had gained a competent strength, for what expression soever he listed to make, but also that that faculty restored to him was at present necessary to be used for his advantage, one day when Eretheria came according to her custom to visit her sick patient, the room being freed by accident from all company else, the youth to her no small amazement prosecuted this discourse. Alas sweet Eretheria , said he, what serve these outward remedies you apply to my weak body, when you leave my heart still subject to a dangerous and painful disease? These words seemed so strange to the ears of the young Lady, that with a certain kinde of amazed look, she onely entertained his expectation for some time, but at last apprehending a few sparkles of love might proceed from her frequent visitations, that had imboldened the youth to higher ambitions, then any way his condition could merit, or she admit of, had drawn from him these extravagant expressions; turning her countenance instantly into a frown, she told him, she was of opinion that his distracted spirit, by reason of his long sickness, had caused him to very ridiculous fancies instead of using fitting respects: To which he suddenly replyed; No, no, most dear Eretheria , know that I am not mad by these new distempers, but long since wounded by your bewitching beauty; therefore as the guilt justly belongs unto you, so ought you also to take upon you the blame: For you may be satisfied if you please, that your patient is no other but your unfortunate servant Eumenes , preserved (as I may say) miraculously from the rage and violence of the Seas unkindness, to be more again tormented and endangered by your cruelty: This was enough to have put Eretheria beyond all degrees of wonder and amazement, since Hyacinthia our Queen had brought news of his and Prince Cassianus miscarriage, as she had been informed by an unfortunate shipwrack in her company: But when again she had computed inwardly in her minde the time of the accident, and the finding of his body lying upon the Sands, to agree punctually together, it rendered her absolutely certain in her belief, that he was no other then the right Eumenes: Besides both his voice and countenance, though much changed by reason of his sickness, at last lively came into her apprehension: So that after she had a long time rested silent, as if her consideration laboured to digest her thoughts into a method, or rather seeming to labour inwardly by the force of many passions, she at last broke out into these expressions, wherein both her words and her tears were sufficient witnesses of her extraordinary distemper: O you Gods, said she, must I be an instrument to protect murther, under the pretence of using charity; much less certainly ought it be imagined, that I should imbrace such a love without my Fathers consent, who undoubtedly can never be pleased with an election of these oppositions; and with that flew out of his Chamber with some violence: This gave Eumenes considerations sufficient imployments, since he was not onely in despair that Eretheria would never entertain his affections, but doubted whether or no she might not deliver him up into the hands of justice for a slaughter he had committed: but again reflecting upon the nobleness of her nature, accompanied with so many rare perfections, he could not believe so pure a whiteness of disposition like the rich Ermin , would suffer it self to be defiled by any provocation to falshood: Nevertheless the grief to be left in that manner by the fair Eretheria , as it were confounded in a vast Sea of confusion, when as before he had raised his hopes to some pitch of probability, by reason of the opportunities he enjoyed, with some respects he had received from her after a tilting, continued his distempers a long time upon him; which also became extreamly augmented, in regard that Eretheria absolutely forbore her accustomed visits: Which caused her belike in the interim, more closely to retire her self amongst the Holy Virgins, in the place where she then remained; either being struck perhaps with the sensible feeling of the youths sufferings (withal a little jealous of her own honour) or the more conveniently to avoid the importunity of such suitors, that her Father had proposed to her choice: However not to detain me over long in the relation, or you in the hearing, by laying open all the circumstances, that might appertain to so passionate a story; Eumenes , after he was in a sort perfectly recovered of his sickness, found means by a certain disguise he borrowed of a young novice belonging to the order, not onely to procure admittance into the conversation of Eretheria (who not being absolutely profest, he might the more conveniently do) but in a short time after he had one day discovered himself to her knowledge, with tears, sighs, and other services, obtained some kinde of entertainment in her favour: Nevertheless in the interim she conjured him, by all those affections, that he could expect from her condition, so to conceal his person from the knowledge of any, that her Father might never suspect either his pretensions, or that he was living: Eumenes although he thought himself sufficiently honoured, that his beautiful Mistriss, would in this manner allow him the freedom of her chaste conversation, yet considering he was not much nearer his journeyes end by the favour, then the Suns revolution, that did but rise and set, to prosecute the one course without alteration, conceived himself to be in a manner in the same predicament as tormented Tantalus ; her permittance being onely remedies to keep his thoughts alwayes in an appetite, without tasting of that fruit which he so much coveted: However his hopes were sufficiently encouraged to keep despair from seizing upon his soul: Thus I say he continued enjoying though he never enjoyed, until the unexpected death of the Duke her Father, gave Eretheria full liberty (as she thought) to dispose of her self without contradiction: At these words Narcissus began to grow pale, insomuch as the Priest asked him how he did? but he reflecting upon the necessity of concealing himself, in regard of the Princess Cloria's desires, whereas she onely upon those conditions, was content to allow him her conversation; and besides considering that the demonstration of any passions could not again call his Father to a new life, told them, that as a little quame had something overcome his stomach, so was he for the present pretty well recovered; wherefore desired Creses , without any more interruption in his behalf, to prosecute his story, which made him quickly return to the matter in this manner: Eretheria , said he, being thus the absolute possessor of her own liberty, as by descent the onely heir to her Fathers Fortunes, since her Brother Narcissus had miscarried unfortunately some time before at Sea, as was generally conceived throughout the whole Island of Cyprus , was presently perswaded by the States of the Countrey, to make election of some noble and worthy Husband, that might be capable to execute that charge and command, that belonged formerly to the Duke her Father; for that by reason of her sex, she could not entirely of her self enjoy the office; being willing, as they said, if it were possible, to continue the jurisdiction in the same blood, in regard of those extraordinary benefits the Island had received by the Government of the late Duke her Father. As Eretheria could not but accept of these propositions, that pretended to so much love to her self and family, after she had returned them a grateful acceptance of their kindness, with all the fitting expressions she could use to that purpose, within a very few dayes, Eumenes was produced to the consideration of the people, as the person she most desired to affect, which without any great opposition was approved of in the general, as being a man who had not onely borne a long affection to the Princess, but upon all occasions had demonstrated a sufficient courage and judgement, worthy of any imployment: As in this manner, he was created both Prince and Governour at the same time, so I left the Island of Cyprus , providing not onely for the Nuptials of the young couple, but for the Funerals of the old Duke; whilst my occasions and passions carried me after the Queen Hyacinthia into Syria , being thither retired as I heard after the death of Philostros , who during his life had absolutely obstructed her passage and intention: Where being no sooner arrived, but as the world had been turned into nothing but wonders, I found also Orsames dead, and his Queen newly brought a bed of two Sons, which afforded the Kingdom of Syria an equal share both of joy and sorrow: This notwithstanding so far protracted my designs, that as I had but little conveniency to present the State of our Lydian affairs to Hyacinthia with all the particulars concerning the Princess Cloria's fortunes, so had she less hope her self to determine of any thing speedily, in regard of the unsettlement of businesses and Governments in Syria , by reason of those new changes that had so lately happened: So that for some time I was constrained to quit the City of Damascus , and to retire my self to a more private place of habitation, finding at Court how unwilling they were to entertain any occasion of charge and expence; the rather for that Prince Arethusius the Kings eldest Son, was onely to be furnished out of his Mothers pension and allowance: But long I had not continued in my voluntary retirement, but sudden intelligence was brought to Court, not onely of the General revolt of the Senate of Lydia's Army from their service, but also that it was reported they had taken King Euarchus out of prison into the Souldiers protection. As this gave all our thoughts, fresh hopes of something speedily to be acted for his good and restoration, so am I at present sent to him with Letters from the Queen, though to what effectual purpose I cannot tell; for that I finde, not onely her self, but the whole State of Syria , to be extreamly addicted to the Myssian interest, which I suppose the Army will never willingly consent unto, in regard they have already so publickly and violently declared to the contrary, as having made it the chief occasion of the quarrel between them and the Senate; which in effect is all I can say, either of my journey or imployment: Then turning himself to the Priest he told him, that he must intreat his company to Court; and this presently carried them all three to supper. When they had ended, the Priest told Narcissus , that although he feared his occasions, would constrain him for the present to take a journey to Court, whereby to have the happiness again to see his old Master the King, and so by consequence not to be longer in a capacity, to do his particular that farther service in his own house he desired; yet he hoped they should have the honour of his company along with them, where he durst undertake, his reception should be equal with either of theirs, in those contents they should receive by so fortunate an occasion. Narcissus after he had thanked him, as well for his past favours as his present offers, assured him, that as he could not but be extreamly joyful, at the opportunity he should have by that voyage, again to behold his great Master in some probability of being restored to his ancient Right and Dignity, so did he wish him unfeignedly to believe, that notwithstanding he could most willingly participate of his good luck, in personally accompanying them to Court, whereby to be an eye-witness of their entertainments, yet such were his pressing occasions (especially in regard of those accidents that had lately happened in the Island of Cyprus ) that he was obliged to make what haste he could possible into his own Countrey, where notwithstanding he should study what requitals he should be any way able to perform, in lieu of those civilities he had received by his means in the Kingdom of Lydia: These complements with other discourses, continued them in communication, until the time of the night caused them all to retire into their several lodgings; and the rather was the haste more necessary, for that the Priest was to make some convenient preparation for the next dayes journey. When Narcissus was come into his Chamber, being there onely accompanied by his solitary thoughts, instead of sleep he fell upon these melancholly considerations: First it came into his minde, that he had not alone lost a dear and loving Father, whose wisdome would have been a continual support unto him in all his difficult affairs, but by that unreparable loss, he was also in danger to be deprived of the best part of his esteemed hereditary honour and command, by the marriage of his Sister with Eumenes , since in his room he was elected chief Governour of the Countrey, in regard of the general opinion was amongst the people of his own death: Yet again notwithstanding this possession, he had some hopes by the affection of the Inhabitants to be restored to his right, when they should by his personal appearance, be made fully acquainted with the mistake; without either blood or trouble; since as he doubted not of the natural affection of his Sister Eretheria , so would he not suspect the noble disposition of Eumenes: But when he reflected upon the lustre and sweetness of Crowns and Dignities, being once enjoyed either by ambitions or high spirits, he conceived there might be more difficulty in the attempt then ordinary, and so consequently an occasion given of contention and slaughter, not possible to be ended between them without destruction to one or other: Besides he doubted for the present which seemed most to trouble him, that these sudden changes, might so far alienate the thoughts and affections of the Princess Cloria from his particular, that she might be induced in the interim, to entertain the Addresses of Cassianus , that were most violently as he knew proposed to her choice by the powerful Senate of Lydia ; and as he imagined would be the sooner entertained, in regard of the King her Fathers present necessities, who by that means might hope the easier to come to the possession of his rights, especially when all opportunities were afforded, either for courtships or solicitation; and probably could not long be resisted, by reason of her constrained condition, that obliged her without prevention, to endure all assaults and affronts to that purpose, that should from time to time be attempted upon her person: As these last considerations most struggled inwardly with his uncertain thoughts, not knowing well whether he should leave Lydia or not, so did he begin to think, that there being no Army in the Field that was in action, and not knowing how to be admitted to Cloria's presence, it would be to little purpose longer to continue in the Kingdom, and therefore resolved presently to go for Cyprus ; where he seemed not to doubt, but that the people (if not Eumenes himself) finding him alive contrary to their expectation, would soon be perswaded to reason in his behalf; and to this purpose being settled in his Fathers command, he should be not onely able to bring assistance to King Euarchus occasions, but also contribute much to his Daughters releasement; whereas the contrary would both confirme the opinion of his being dead, and in some sort accuse him of too much sloth in his own nature, for not appearing activer in those concernments of his own, that belonged so exceedingly to his honour and welfare: With these resolutions he quickly fell asleep. In the morning the old Priest came to Narcissus to take his leave with these complements, that as he had hitherto been ashamed, that his own disability to render him those services due to his worth, had made him want he feared such entertainment as was fitting in his poor habitation, so much more since he was now forced to leave him by the accidental journey, he was constrained to make to Court in the company of Creses ; but if he pleased to design any longer stay in the Kingdom of Lydia , he should take it for some part of satisfaction to his fortunes, that he would resolve to make use of his house in his absence; a place should be alwayes ready he assured him, to afford him the best conveniency it was able for his abode: Which he refusing with the like complements, they both presently descended into the Hall, where they found Creses ready prepared to take horse: After they had eat a bit or two, and performed some other few ceremonies belonging to their departure, they quickly mounted their Steads. The Priest and Creses had not travelled many furlongs together, ere they met with a most even and direct path-way; and that commodity as it should seem, invited them both to a new discourse, since the Priest seemed extreamly unsatisfied as yet, why the State of Syria , and much more the Queen Hyacinthia , should be so unwilling to entertain a correspondency with the Army, that had delivered the person of Euarchus out of prison, though passionately desirous to retain an interest with the Myssians , that had apparently betrayed him thither, according to the common opinion almost of all Asia . Father, said Creses , as I have already made unto you a relation of my voyage into Cyprus , with some part of my proceedings in Syria , so having for the present so fair an opportunity, I shall endeavour to let you know my thoughts, in many other particulars, that I have not yet mentioned: To this purpose you must understand, that however the people of the Island of Crete , seem to profess the same Worship of the Gods with the State of Syria , yet cannot they obtain the free exercise of Religion, either from King Euarchus or his Queen Hyacinthia ; though Euarchus by the Court of Syria hath been prest, not onely to sign all the chief Articles of the Myssians , but also even to subscribe to their tenents in matter of Doctrine, notwithstanding they be altogether destructive to Kingly Rule or the Religion of Syria: As this gives me not so much encouragement in my journey as I could wish, in regard the Souldiers will not be willing to allow of any interest but their own, towards the placing of the King again in his Throne, so the Commissioners of the Myssians as I hear, are extreamly busie about the Kings Person, to the no small discontentment of the Army, that hath him now under their jurisdiction: The Queen when I parted from her at Damascus gave me express order, that however I might complement with the Souldiers, and draw from them all the advantages that possibly I could, tending to her Husbands service, yet I must be sure as she told me in the first place, to possess the Myssians with an opinion, that Euarchus chief trust must still rest in their fidelities and assistance, though he be forced for the present to comply with the Army, that delivered him out of the hands of the Senate: But here I make no doubt but you will ask me, why the State of Syria , much less our Queen Hyacinthia , should be so wedded to the Myssians particular? when as probably they can never be brought, to be hearty in the Kings Affairs, since not onely in the beginning of these times they opposed his Authority, with all the craft and violence they could possibly use, but at last, as I may say, delivered him betrayed and bound hand and foot, into the hands of those that were esteemed by himself his greatest enemies, when as he had chosen for his protection, rather the Myssian Army then the Senate of Lydia ; and this expression of ill nature and treachery, was onely to obtain the payment of a small sum of money, not to be valued in regard of a Kings ransome: So that I say it may be supposed, they have some other hidden mystery in their thoughts against his prosperity, which perhaps the State of Syria will never be able sufficiently to understand, whilst it be too late to repair the Kings losses onely procured by those people: For it is well known, during the time they gave Euarchus the best hopes concerning their affections and fidelity, they were then by their false instruments, contracting with the Senate for his speedy imprisonment; a plain demonstration of their harsh and cruel intentions towards his particular; for that when they most betrayed him, they profest themselves then his faithfullest servants; as it were smothering him in a Bed of Roses, and killing him with deceitful language: Whereas of the other side, these Souldiers that have not onely the Kings Person, but his Authority under their jurisdiction; and so by consequence may either shorten his Life or preserve his Dignity, notwithstanding they have heretofore alwayes declared themselves mortal enemies to his interest, and proceedings, as never having had any dependency upon the Court or his Affairs, yet now appear to the outward view of the world, to be his greatest friends, either being converted and altered in their opinions, or more compassionate and just in their dispositions: Which certainly cannot but extreamly augment the obligations, if they perform any thing remarkable according to their professions; but as I will not trouble you with my thoughts, what may be the issue of their intentions or actions, so must I a little discourse unto you, what may be the suppositions of the Syrian State, that seems so much to countenance the Myssians before the Souldiers; and to say the plain truth do more favour them then any other people, that have seemed most affectionate towards the Kings Interest. First you may suppose, that they think the Myssians , not onely in regard that most of the Gentry and Nobility, have either command or imployment in the Army or Wars of Syria , but the common people and inferiour sort, have such a dependency upon that Nation, by reason of certain priviledges granted them time out of minde, by way of a free Trade and Commerce amongst them, that it is unpossible for them to quit their interest, for any other benefit that can be proposed to their consideration: And the rather for that the Court maintains alwayes some Ambassadour or Agent in their Countrey, both to direct their actions and designs, and to inform the State upon all occasions of their proceedings; which joyned with the large pensions are bestowed amongst their Rulers, and other eminent persons of Myssia , will prove as they believe necessary ties and obligations to retain their fidelities constant to the Syrian ends; and so consequently can they never attempt the destroying or lessening of Monarchy, but as they shall direct and approve of: Besides most of the factions now prevailing against Euarchus Authority in Myssia , are composed either of Lords or Priests, who are most commonly not so envious to royalty (or at leastwise as they may believe more to be perswaded by reason) then extravagant people, that have learned no rules necessary to Government and Order, by any manner of fitting education; wherefore not so much to be feared in their courses and prevailing jurisdiction, if they should be suffered something too much to prosper in either proceedings against their King: Secondly, it cannot be doubted, but that Monarchy in the general, is a great deal more conducing to the commodity of the Myssians , then a common Government, either in Lydia or Myssia ; and therefore not probable they should joyn in such a strict amity with the Senate, as absolutely to destroy the prerogative, and Kingly jurisdiction of Euarchus , since by that conclusion, they would neither be able to temper their own factions at home, amongst the Nobility and persons of greatest quality, nor have any hope to receive benefit from other Princes abroad in their occasions: And whereas many may be perswaded to believe, that by agreeing in those designs, for the absolute overthrowing of Monarchy in Lydia , they might in time come to be equal sharers in the Government of both Kingdoms; and so consequently participate alike in the profit and gain, being the chief (if not the onely) thing their covetous dispositions look after, such thoughts are meer fancies and chymera's: For certainly the Senate understanding well the poorness of the Countrey of Myssia , and not being ignorant of the secret intentions of the people, withal how insulting and encroaching they are in their natures; will be sure to take order, they shall have no more interest in the Affairs of Lydia , then is intirely necessary for their own service and commodity: So that when the Myssians shall finde their aims to fail in these particulars, it is to be imagined that they will not onely be perswaded, upon the least endeavour of the State of Syria , to fall off from the Lydian faction, but even to make a War with that Nation it self, for the establishing again of their King in his ancient glory and command, and to that effect adhere either to Syria or any other Nation that may assist them in those proceedings: Onely this doubt in some sort may be made, that Argilius and Lycius , who so unworthily have betrayed the Kings person for a summe of money, will never by their good wills trust themselves any more under his power, for fear of revenge answerable to their deserts; and they being the most principal men of the Countrey, it is to be suspected, they will have so great power and influence, over the actions and determinations of the rest of the Inhabitants in the general, that they can never be brought in any kinde to own the Kings Interest to purpose, notwithstanding all the labour and industry of the Kingdom of Syria: But to this I shall onely make this answer, that however these people prevailed in the Myssian Army for the selling of the Kings Person, against the thoughts and wills of many, yet that very action of theirs, hath procured them since so much hatred in their own Countrey, that it may very probably be believed by the State of Syria , there must of necessity arise daily new factions amongst them; neither want they intelligence at the present, that assures them that an Army will suddenly march into Lydia from Myssia , in King Euarchus behalf: Which advertisement I suppose is sent them by their Ambassadour there remaining: Last of all I may adde, that the Court of Syria may imagine, the Souldiers who have now the King in their possession, having no other relation but to their own wills and uncertain principles, will prove from time to time as inconstant in their resolutions, as they have been heretofore desperate in their fortunes, and be rather in the general, inclinable to affect equality, then continue long contented to be governed by Kingly Authority or to say the plain truth willing to be under any jurisdiction whatsoever, witness their falling off from their command, both under the Senate and their old General: Besides it is esteemed a maxime among their tenents, to have scarce dependency upon any power, neither in those things that belong to the Gods Worship, or concerning other their humane actions, pretending by such constraint, an absolute freedome cannot be enjoyed, either in minde or body; so that however the King may seem a little to revive by their proceedings, yet I can assure you in Syria , there is a great doubt made of the reality of their actions: But whether these opinions be grounded, either upon the perswasions of the Myssians , or upon other more solid though secret reasons, I will not take upon me at present to determine; but rather shall expect both with hope and patience the issue, in the interim apply my self to my direction and commission, as well in keeping a correspondency with the Souldiers as with the Myssians: By this time again the way began to be something uneven, so that they could not well prosecute any farther discourse. At night they took up their lodging, not above half a dayes journey from where the King remained, and not much farther distant from the City of Sardis , where encountering with a jovial companion master of the house, as appearing also faithful to Euarchus in his intentions, after they had accommodated themselves to their mindes in their Chambers, they desired their Hoast with an equal indifference to let them understand, as well the news that concerned the proceedings of the Senate, as that which belonged more properly to the Army; since as they said, they could not chuse, but be of a nature something more remarkable then ordinary, in regard of the late transactions of both parties, which seemed at present to put most of the Kingdom to a kinde of a vast consideration concerning the issue: The rather were they curious of this information, the better thereby to taste the inclinations of the people. Truly Gentlemen, said the Hoast, as I must not take upon me the understanding of either of their proceedings and determinations, when as perhaps they are not very well acquainted with their own intentions themselves, so shall I to supply that defect enform you, if you please, of those discourses that have lately passed in the Senate, concerning the Kings Government, notwithstanding the Souldiers have him personally at the present under their jurisdiction; who to say the plain truth, use him with that civility and respect, that it gives his friends more then ordinary hopes, of his speedy restoration again to the honour of his Crowns and Dignity; however the Gods onely know what the issue of their determinations may be: Some of the Senate would have no King at all, pretending that it would be too miserable a condition for all sorts of people, to be subject both in their Persons and Estates to an entire Monarch, not suffering them so much as to ask a reason concerning any thing that should be done amiss, although their purses and pains were forced upon all occasions to pay for the honour, and the pride belonging to the Dignity: Whereas a common Government, as they say, gives a certain kinde of encouragement, pleasing in some kinde or other, to all sorts of people, as having an appropriated share in every action, that concerns the good or ill of the Commonwealth: Others again of a contrary spirit pretend, they are afraid, that if the Government should be absolutely changed to a popular State, though it might seem in outward appearance, to have more freedome, it could not nevertheless but be of less security, in that it would be alwayes subject to faction and confusion, in regard of the inconstancy of dispositions, and therefore are rather of opinion, that the Government remain in the same nature as it doth, with some necessary restrictions to their King: A third sort make some doubt, how to finde out wayes to limit a Monarch in any kinde, by what Laws soever could be established to that purpose, it being almost impossible to take from a Prince altogether the Sword of Justice and Power, and yet suffer him still to remain in the condition of a Governour; which in effect would be no other, then a common Government varnished over, with a glorious Title to no effect, leaving the whole as subject to faction and confusion, as if there were no King at all; in that he should want the authority, although he were honoured with the name necessary to that purpose: There were others that suddenly started up in the Senate House, who imagined they had thought upon a way, to remedy all inconveniencies; which was to have onely a King by election, either of Euarchus Family or some other: But the proposition was quickly answered with these doubts. That if the Prince intended should be elected out of the same Blood, if not according to the direct line of succession, it would endanger a new slaughter and faction, through the whole Kingdome, by reason of severall ambitious interests; of the other side, if he were absolutely chosen out of another Family, as no doubt but there would be many opposers, in the very election it self, so not possible to have any of an extraction illustrious enough, to warrant his kindred from being a burthen to the Commonwealth in their maintenance and support; which probably would prove a sufficient inconvenience to the people; for that oftentimes justice would be sold, and other oppressions committed, onely to supply a needy and indigent family: In conclusion, however many seemed willing again to restore Euarchus , and his posterity to their ancient Rights and Dignity, yet fearing in regard of their own proceedings, that they might be strictly called in question for their past actions, they utterly desisted from that resolution: And notwithstanding these several and violent discourses, they settle upon no determination whatsoever; onely at last they ordered, the Government should remain as it was at present in the Senates power, though bearing still the name of Euarchus , until farther consideration: I must tell you, as these have been the disputations in the Councels at Sardis , both before and since the revolt of the Army, so now by their favours as we suppose, they must ask leave of the Souldiers, before they settle either a Government in themselves, or take it away from others; and the rather am I induced to this belief, for that the common people, appear not yet much scandalized at the late revolt; but of the contrary, as 'tis thought, would be extreamly satisfied with the Souldiers proceedings, if they should speedily again turn the stream into its right course: However in that I shall say the least that may be, until I be more instructed in the constitution of the world. With these words he ended his discourse, and presently took his leave; pretending some other company in his house, needed also another part of his entertainment. This information of the Hoast, gave Creses and the Priest occasion, to fall into a more serious disputation, concerning the nature and property of Monarcy and other Governments, according to divers opinions and judgements, with the several benefits and inconveniencies belonging to them: The Priest would needs take upon him the defence of the Kingly part, whilst Creses was to be content with the more inferiour degree: Both notwithstanding grounding their discourses, from the hopes they had, that the Souldiers would shortly again restore Euarchus to his Crown and Government: The Priest first began in this manner. As Monarchy in the general, said he, hath been held by Writers, to be the best and most absolute way of Government, so ought it as well be granted, that a Prince by descent and inheritance, is the freest of all others from burthen and inconvenience to the people; since the making up of new families upon every exchange, and the many dangerous factions would arise by reason of elections, would at one time or other, either hazzard or ruine the Commonwealth; for that all ambitions could never be supprest totally in every person, with the onely consideration of the common safety: But that I may more particularly make good my argument, I shall endeavour from certain principles of Divinity, Nature, and Institution, to prove my affirmation and opinion: In the first place, according to the example of the Divine Providence, there is but one God that made and now rules the Heavens, since if there were more, none could be absolute, much less Omnipotent in any kinde, and so consequently the Government, should still be subject to variation, both in part and in the whole; for as divers persons must have several wills, so that of necessity would confound commands and distract obedience, whereby executions could not chuse but be protracted, to the rendering of all actions and endeavours, of no considerable force and validity to the convenient and orderly rule of the world: Wherefore we see, subordinate offices are appointed in every degree, by this great and all powerful God; every distinct Orb being so involved one within another, until they all become governed by the first motion, onely to avoid equality and confusion: So that we may easily perceive by that decorum, that there is an entire necessity of one Governour: As for example, there is but one Sun that governs the day, as another light shines in the night, neither of which being accompanied with any of equal authority or influence; as it were both pretending, to a certain manner of absolute Monarchy in their several kindes of motion and lustre: In the second place, by the very rules of nature we have experience, that some one in every species pretends above the rest to Dominion and jurisdiction: As for the purpose, the industrious and painful Commonwealth of the Bees, have alwayes one to go before them, whose person and voice they onely obey and follow, with a seeming care and extraordinary obedience: The silly Ants in like manner have their Prince amongst them, who seems by his absolute authority, onely to govern and direct their labours, tending to unity and benefit, in their small and innocent Commonwealth, so that these being creatures no way given to exorbitancy of will as men are, if it be necessary for them to have but one Governour, much more for us who are given in a manner to nothing but malice and pride, whereby to be kept in order and regulated in our dispositions; which certainly cannot long be without the authority of some single power, that must not be equalled or contracted by any other: we see if two strange Bulls be but turned loose together in any pasture, their contention one with another never ends, whilst one of the two have gained the absolute mastery over the other: with what extraordinary hatred and malice will two little Cocks of the Game, persecute one another in blood and wounds, until the one of them have obtained the victory by the others death and ruine? Nay, example me if you can, any two Males of any generous kinde whatsoever, that will endure the others society, without an absolute subjection to his power and courage; as it were never but striving till one have procured the entire jurisdiction of the place; as if nature by no means could admit of an equality in government; whereas of the contrary, the Females, as being not at all ordained for rule and command, are seemingly contented with the society and company of their fellows: which shews in my opinion a certain kinde of necessity in all governments of one onely Monarch, not onely to avoid faction and confusion, but to unite desires and industry, towards the wellfare and benefit of any Commonwealth; since without such a known power and command, it is almost impossible to bridle and keep in order at all times, the unruly fancies and exorbitant desires of mankinde; whole very nature or inclination, doth swell as it were with nothing but appetites of contentions: Lastly, concerning the very institution of governments upon earth; the first certainly was Monarchy; for as in the beginning a man in his own private family, appeared to be the onely absolute Prince to be obeyed, so Dominions and Kingdoms became no other way established in the infancy of the world, but by the uniting together of several housholds, either by accident or conquest: And though sometimes people meerly out of necessity, to keep themselves the better in peace and quietness, were forced to chuse and form Commonwealths, yet we scarce read of any jurisdiction to be entertained, (at leastwise to be continued for any considerable space) but where one single power chiefly, if not absolutely commanded over the whole; as if the multitude by the very light of nature, being led thereunto by the meer dictates of reason, without any manner of science or experience, were constrained to believe, that no other government could be safe and lasting; however their Lords not seldom proved the cruellest Tyrants could be imagined: As I cannot deny, but by reason of the exorbitancy of pernitious and wicked Princes, a State hath been changed from a private to a popular Commonwealth or Government; yet scarce did I ever hear of any, but that both began and ended in Kingly Authority; as being still by some accident or other, constrained to that election or conversion, either in absolute power, or mixt representation, as if some kinde of necessity required such an establishment to render it lasting, and convenient to the people. Nevertheless, said Creses , it is a most miserable condition for the people, to be in a continual subjection, under the power and command of either an impotent or exorbitant Prince; for though he should know what were best to be done; yet his perverse nature and disposition, would not suffer him to put it in execution. And if he knew not how to govern, he becomes led by the pride and covetousness of others: Again, put the case Government might fall into the hands of a mad man or a fool, what remedy then could be expected, whereby the people might in any kinde have the least hope of redress? since by the Laws and Rules of Inheritance, he were to continue still without prevention and obstacle; which of necessity some time or other would happen; and consequently cast the Government into the hands of such as he should chuse, that probably were not far from his own temper in any thing: in like manner, it must be the same during the time of the Princes infancy, being by that means rendred altogether uncapable either of governing himself or others. 'Tis true, answered the Priest, the misfortune to a Kingdom is not small when either of these happen: but however as no private interest can be so destroying as general confusion, so can it not be but much safer for a Commonwealth, to be under the jurisdiction of one vicious or impotent Prince, (who 'tis likely will be glutted by his excesses, or may be assisted in his Councels) then for it to be wholly governed, by many disagreeing heads and factious dispositions, that direct several wayes in their intentions and consultations; which of necessity must distract all profitable determinations, and at the best cannot but protract, if not absolutely hinder those executions tending to peace and prosperity; being scarce to be avoided in a common Government, where opinions and interests are several in the Rulers: besides it is well known that in such Councels, secrets of the most highest nature (for that they are committed to many) are subject to be revealed if not betrayed. But according to my sense and belief, said Creses , such a Magistracy might be created out of the whole, that when good and necessary fundamental Laws were agreed upon, might easily govern with secrecy and moderation to the benefit of the people, who would be pleased sufficiently, in having the name of the election of such Ministers. If you mean, said the Priest, that this jurisdiction should be eternal, it were a great deal worse and more dangerous in matters of tyranny and injustice, then to be under one single Prince, by inheritance, since he might dye, and by that means, his Successor might again bring ease and remedy; but the other assembly being once in the greater part corrupted, it were impossible ever to expect any redress, at all; for that those that should happen to succeed, would come to their places but one by one, and consequently could not have voices in number sufficient, to countervail the opinions of the rest, remaining in the Councel of Magistracy: besides if any should have received injury, or endured oppression by the casting voices of the whole assembly, to whom should he flye for remedy and redress? Since every one singly would put off the blame from himself; pretending not to have authority and power sufficient, without the generality of that congregation, to repair the injured person; which seldom or never could be procured: whereas being wronged or oppressed by a Prince, or any of his Officers or Ministers of State, it would be no great difficulty, to make the particular complaint understood at one time or another to himself; and more facile it would be a great deal, for the Monarch or Governour speedily to afford the remedy, either in that, that concerned his own person, or belonging to any of his Commissioners; for else he should be forced to take upon him the blame, before the face of all the world; whereas the others actions, (that is to say concerning the particular) would be so involved in the dark, that it were almost impossible to make it appear, where the fault lay but in the general assembly; who without an infinite labour could not be brought to understand, much less to redress the grievance: And if you mean this Magistracy or supream Authority, should be onely temporary, and so consequently be made subject upon all occasions to the election and questioning of the common people; what a world of inconveniencies would it bring? not onely by continual factions and disorders, in the chusing these new Magistrates, but in the very spite and heart-burning, would be occasioned thereby amongst the people, being carried on to this election, by a certain conceived greatness in their own opinion, that might render their rude ambitions extreamly unsatisfied, if they should be at any time crost in their choice; with a thousand other inconveniences that I cannot mention. Yet said Creses , although it should be granted, that in those particulars you have mentioned, Monarchy were to be esteemed the most convenient Government of all others; however it cannot be denied, but that the common people are in that slavery under such a jurisdiction, that they cannot possibly have hearts sufficiently affectionate to render them entirely industrious, towards the profit and good of the Commonwealth in the general, in regard that however they toyl and takes pains in abundance, they can never attain to any places of dignity or respect in the Kingdom, either to content their thoughts or advance their esteem; whereas in a popular State, the meanest is in the same capacity of preferment, as the highest born person in the Countrey. Although this be true, said the Priest, yet the defect proceeds not from their natural unhappiness, but from their disability or want of knowledge, in regard of their deficiency in education, which inconveniency and defect, they will as well suffer in a popular Government, as in a Kingly Authority, since no worthy person whatsoever is debarred from preferment in a Monarchy, if his industry and parts can merit the honour and advancement; and although he should in any kinde miss of his expectation, yet it would not grieve him so much to be under the jurisdiction of the Nobility, that are by birth and extraction above his condition, as to finde himself much subordinate and inferiour, to those of his own rank and quality; to be esteemed of all others most irkesome to humane nature: so that you see it is but meer fancy, that engenders these considerations and opinions: Besides there are other inconveniences and omissions appertaining to a popular Government; as for example, it seldom or never prefers or rewards worthy persons, according to their deserts and merits; when as for the most part smallest crimes and defects, are punished by most fearful and horrid severity; proceeding either from envy or jealousie, which is the occasion that oftentimes, when Generals, Commanders, or States- men have procured a sufficient interest and esteem amongst all sorts of people, whereby to be able to contend, doubting their own safeties from the Magistracy, they enter presently into such rebellions, that either turn the Commonwealth into a Tyrannical Monarchy, or occasion at the best so much blood and slaughter, that every Subject thereof hath reason enough to fear his own loss, if not general destruction; whereas a Prince being of so eminent a condition himself, not to be equalled by any of what quality soever, hath no cause to be envious or suspicious: Again, the Prince hath a more nearer interest in his Countreys good, then all his Subjects besides by way of personal honour, wherefore a greater benefit or loss attends him in every thing that is acted, since he creates not onely the Officer that commands or executes, but enjoyes the profit or disprofit of the success, whereas the people in a Commonwealth receive it but in the general, no one man being able to appropriate any publick action particularly to himself; which is a principal motive to enduce the Prince, to attend earnestly the prosperity of the Government, because he may be said truly to esteem it his own, which no other person can do in what constitutions soever, if there be others in equal authority with him; for joynt interests, will never take so much the fancy and opinion of the owners, as those which are singly appertaining but to one onely. Well (said Creses ) although I see upon any terms, you will needs have a Monarchy to be the best Government, yet nevertheless I must not have a Prince altogether unlimited, as it were threatning a kinde of a fearful apprehension of Tyranny to his people; by which means they would be hindred, from endeavouring industriously, either the common good or their private welfare: but rather I should wish a King, in some sort bound by Laws Fundamental, established by a laudable constitution at the first; however not to be so strictly chained up, that he were left no power or prerogative at all, without his Subjects leave, or be so let loose to his own will and pleasure, that he might injure and oppress his people as he lift; that is to say, to have the Government to enjoy such a mixture in the whole, that the Subjects might not be over-bold, to approach his presence without an awful reverence, or he to be puffed up with a vain opinion, (by reason of his dignity) that the Kingdom or Commonwealth was bestowed upon his condition, more for his own use then the good of his people. Nor I neither said the Priest: whereupon being called away to supper, they suddenly broke off the rest of their discourse. The next day about noon they arrived at Court, or rather was it to be called a Camp, since the Souldiers seemed to bear all the sway, notwithstanding others had a civil liberty allowed them, to be admitted upon every occasion needful into the Kings presence. When Euarchus was informed, not onely of their arrival, but that Creses had brought him Letters out of Syria from the Queen, he with a great deal of passion sent presently for them into his presence: upon their entrance they found him seated in a kinde of a confined Majesty, Earezius being on his right hand not far from his person, and a little below him stood one Hercrombrotus his Lieutenant General, a man that seemed to carry not onely design, but policy in his countenance: about them were placed many common souldiers in the nature of a guard; however expressing more then ordinary freedom both in their looks and demeanor: Creses after he had performed his wonted reverences, approached the King with a humility, answerable to his titles, though not his condition, presenting him with the Queens Letters, which Euarchus hastily taking out of his hands, read them with tears in his eyes; and then asked him sundry questions, both of his wife and son Prince: Arethusius ; wishing withal, he might once more have the happiness to enjoy their company in Lydia : whereunto Creses soon replyed, that he did not doubt but that the gods e're long, would to that purpose be favourable to his pious intentions: Truly, said the King, turning at the same time to Farezius , this brave Commander doth give me more then probable hopes to this effect: but Farezius made him no other answer, then by a kinde of humble bending of his body, seemed to intimate a willingness in any thing to comply with his desires. Having for some time thus discoursed together in publick, the King (also taking notice of the old Priest with more then ordinary affection) led Creses into an out-window in the same room, that was sheltred from the view of the common people, by large Curtains that reached to the ground, where after they had continued for the space of an hour in private conference, the King calling unto him Farezius , used this language, with such a look, as might procure compassion from the cruellest tyrant in the world. Farezius , said he, as I have sufficient experience of your civilities, since it was my good fortune to be absolutely under your jurisdiction, so cannot I but presume upon the continuance of these courtesies, finding your nature to be both noble and constant: wherefore to this purpose I would have you know, that it is not alone my own desire at this present, to have some comfort and consolation by the sight and conversation of my children, kept so long from my possession by the power of the Senate sitting at Sardis , but also have received conjurations by these Letters from my wife remaining in Syria , if it be possible so far to procure my own information concerning their particulars, that I may give her a true account, both of their comportments and education, whereby the better to satisfie her motherly affection and natural inclination: when the King had ended this supplication, so far (as I may say) beneath his dignity, though consonant in some sort to his condition, Farezius after a short pause returned him this answer. Although I must confess your Majesties desires, are grounded upon all the principles both of nature and morality, yet you must be pleased likewise to know, that at present, I finde my own power and interest so far weakned in Sardis , by the prevailing faction of the Myssians , that I dare not be over-confident of any request I shall make in your behalf; especially for that I am neither assured to continue still the Senates General, or can procure those Senators to be punished, that with so much violence, exclaim hourly at that attempt of ours concerning your releasement: but nevertheless if you please, that Creses now in communication with you, may be employed as a messenger to demand these conditions, I shall procure him as large a commission as possibly I can from the whole Army to that effect; and being denied by the Senate any of our just desires, we may adde your authority to the willingness of the Souldiers, to force them from the opposers: As these motions were quickly embraced by the Kings apprehension and consent, with many thankfull expressions, so Creses wanted neither courage nor loyalty, to take upon him the execution, to the best advantage both for Euarchus service, and the Armies profit. When Creses arrived at Sardis , and had with some eloquence and more judgement, delivered his message, being again retired for about half an hours space, he received these answers to every particular from the Senate: First it was told him, that whereas it was desired, the Kings Children might not onely perform their naturall duty to their Father by a speedy visit, but might also for some considerable time, remain in his company and conversation, (however they conceived it against the rules of State policy, to have any single person pleasured before the publique good) yet that Farezius should see how much they valued his Request, the Senate had determined the children might make a journey to that effect, upon assurance given for their safe return after some few dayes of salutation: Again, whereas the Generall seemed to desire, a continuation of his power and command under the Senates authority, they not onely granted him his own demand, but wisht Creses to assure Farezius , that as they had never any intention to out him of his office, contrary to his own consent, so would they ever be most sensible of his brave and gallant services: but for the proposition, that concerned the accusation of some of their fellow Senators, they conceived it a derogation to the high places they held in the Commonwealth, to have them so much as suspected, much less to suffer them to be brought as guilty Malefactors before any other Tribunall then their own, being persons (as they said) whom they had found most true and faithful to the common interest: Nevertheless they condescended by way of perswasion, to cause them voluntarily to leave the Kingdom for some small time, whereby the better to allay the rage and discontents of the Souldiers, until they could be fully satisfied in their endeavours and fidelities: These answers did but in part give content to Creses expectation, especially for that the Senate seemed, not onely as he conceived, to put on a kinde of more then ordinary insolency in their demeanors, but withal did not so much as take any notice at all of Euarchus dignity, or that they intended any of those respects for his sake. Though Creses with a great deal of indignation, had attended their deliberations, yet he was content with some humility, to beg leave to visit the Princesse; which being obtained, he found her seated in a melancholly Room, that had no more light bestowed upon it, then what was meerly necessary, for the performance of those services due to her condition; her person being shut up in a black Couch, so obscured with divers Curtains, that scarce could her rare beauty be otherwise discovered, then as the fair Moon, shadowed by too many black clouds; however now and then as the Princess moved, there appeared bright and gentle rayes of those perfections, which could not be altogether hid; in this manner being admitted to kiss her white hand, with many sighs, and not a few tears, she aked of her fathers health, with some other circumstances: But the uncompassionate guard, would not suffer her to be so punctual in her questions as she desired, until at last Creses was separated again from her presence, by those watchfull spies, that had the nearest custody of her person, who belike as guilty men, feared Treason in their very looks, since no words were uttered, but what they understood; so that he was conducted to the Castle gate, onely by Roxana's ample complements, instead of her Mistresses more full expressions. But however the Senate had made these large promises during Creses his presence; yet afterward upon other considerations, they not onely denied the Princess Cloria access to her Father, being unwilling belike to hazard so precious a Jewel out of their custody, but those Senators accused of Treason, with the City of Sardis assistance, within a very few dayes beset the Senate House by multitudes of their faction, not onely denying to stand to the former Orders, of giving Farezius possession of the Castle of the Town; but also professing, they would not consent to their own banishment, alledging that the General rather deserved to be punished as a Traitor, for having made so unjust and insolent a demand, then themselves to be judged for any crime; who were not onely thus liberal in their language, but caused the Senate to disannul their former Decrees. The news of this inraged multitude, was quickly brought unto the knowledge of the whole Army, and so consequently to Farezius ; who after he had for some hours consulted with the rest of the Officers, resolved to march towards the Walls of Sardis , where after a short siege, and no great slaughter, the proud inhabitants yielded absolutely to his mercy, whilst the chief Magistrates of the City, issued out to give him friendly entertainment, finding he had the greater party in the Town: In this manner with a most magnificent triumph, they brought him to take possession of that command, that before with some obstinacy they had refused; and afterward most ceremoniously conducted him to the very Senate , in which place he was received with new honours. Cloria having notice given her of the Generals intention to visit her, began to consider with what reception she should entertain his presence, since he appeared to her thoughts not onely one, who had lately conquered the whole Kingdome by his prosperity; but seemed at the present, to grasp the very fate of her Father; and therefore believed, she was not to receive him in her accustomed sad posture, left he might interpret it, either a contempt of his power, or a sorrow for his fortune: so that she commanded her Chamber to be adorned with Hangings of green Velvet, belonging to the Kings Wardrobe, embroidered with compartments of Gold, wherein was wrought the several Armories of her Ancestors of both sides, divided by certain colours of rich cloth of Tissue , interwoven with such variety of beautiful flowers, that it seemed the Princess had placed her self in a delicious Garden, to give Farezius the more delightful welcome; which was encreased by her own sweet countenance, seated upon a Bed of the same Livery; though the inside differed in invention, however it exceeded in curiosity, wherein with artificial needlework, was designed the story of Venus and Adonis , and with that lively art, that the blushing anger appeared in the boyes cheeks, at the lascivious carriage of the Queen of Love, whilst in other places he seemed to have put on a smiling countenance, that he had broke from her forcible embracements: but that which was admirably expressed in death it self, accompanied with a lively sorrow, was the amazed grief of the Goddess, when she beheld her slaughtered Servant lying in his own blood, torn with the rude Tusks of the savage Boar, and his dejected followers, seemingly confounded at the object: Nor was it little less pittiful, to behold his poor Dogs here and there dispersed, as if also they apprehended their own loss, by their masters destruction. Over the chimney was a large picture of most excellent workmanship, wherein was set forth the banishment of proud Tarquin by his enraged Subjects. As soon as Farezius entred the room, he pawsed a while (being surprized with an entire amazement) before he approached the Princess, as if he apprehended some fear of Sacriledge in attempting such an appearing Deity; but being invited by a gentle smile, that afforded not onely a greater encouragement to him, but added new grace to her own Beauty, he advanced with slow steps to perform those Reverences due to her Dignity, which at last brought him to that distance, that gave her conveniency to ask him concerning her Fathers state; in which demand she put on such a look, that shewed she desired something (though in words she begged nothing) that easily lay within his power to grant. But the Gods seemed too cruell to make her a mendicant, whose perfections deserved rather to have sufficient authority to command all hearts: However, the General, as if at the present he understood little else but admiration, for a long time answered not her questions, which gave occasion to Cloria again to redouble her passion, with other interrogations upon the same subject; so that Farezius at last breaking through his amazement, told her, that he was in as prosperous a condition, as the unfortunate affairs of the Commonweal would permit, wherein he had employed his best service with all Loyalty. This answer scarce gave satisfaction to the Princesse, since she conceived Farezius had designed his whole endeavours for the present establishment of the King in his ancient Dignity; and therefore turn'd away from his sight with a few gentle tears in her fair eyes; which being perceived by the General, he humbly besought her to put off all sadness from her heart, for that he did not doubt, but prosperity would succeed to her Father, according to his merit, and her own wishes; however the issue, as he said, must be attended yet with some patience, since first the Souldiers were to be paid, who had spilt their blood freely for the liberty of their Countrey; and the common people in like manner must be satisfied, that had hitherto paid for the purchase. But what the sweet Cloria would have answered to this discourse could not be known, since Farezius occasions call'd him suddenly away from her presence into the City, not so much to receive those Triumphs prepared for his further entertainment, as to procure money for his Army. Though the General continued some violence against the rich Town of Sardis , in imprisoning their chief Officers; as also in causing those Senators which he had formerly accused to be sent into banishment, yet the affairs of Euarchus became no whit more amended, since he was not onely still detained as a Prisoner, though with something a greater liberty and freedom, but the Senate was permitted to presse his patience, with those former propositions they had sent by Argylius prejudiciall to his Crown, and in truth to the absolute taking away of all his Royall Authority, which gave occasion of many discourses amongst all sorts of people: some said that Farezius was in love with the Princesse Cloria , and by that means endeavoured to force the Kings consent to the Marriage, whom he thought else could not be brought to yield to such unequall Nuptialls; much lesse would his Daughter be won, to give up her person to those disadvantages, who had been Courted by all the great Princes of Asia with multitudes of glorious offers. Others again believed, the contrary faction began to prevail, and had by some means either bribed Farezius to their party, or out-witted his designs: Neither wanted there a third Company that imagined, the people grew weary of their own sufferings, by reason of the Armies free quarter, suspecting the Generalls power and intentions, onely to make himself and his Souldiers mighty, without looking upon their Liberties and Prosperity. For a testimony of which as they supposed, the Nobility carried the chief sway in the Senate House, contrary to their desires; however certain Trybunes were chosen in the Army, to prefer the rights of the ordinary Souldiers, and common people. Whilst these thoughts, or rather fancies were tost to and fro, almost in every mans bosome; for that the whole Affairs of the Kingdome were at a stand, and Euarchus seemingly no nearer his enlargement then the first day he was imprisoned; nay, farther off in most opinions: Roxana one morning, according to her custom (being troubled with more fears then ordinary; for that the Princess her Mistress, appeared to her imaginations, not a little concerned in the business, since it was not improbable, but some sparkles of love joyned with Farezius ambition might be obstacles against the Kings prosperity) came to entertain her self, within certain Groves belonging to the Castle, which were ordered into many delightfull walks, that here and there crossed one another, for the more conveniency of the Company, that should frequent them for recreation; where long she had not remained, disputing with her doubts and hopes, but she met accidentally with Creses , who seemed to be there with the same intention: they both appeared pleased at the encounter; whereupon Creses quickly asked her after some short salutation, what she thought of the strangeness of these times, so much changed contrary to both their expectations, when as they looked rather for the King to have been royally received in Sardis , then, to have been still continued a prisoner, much lesse to be pressed with new propositions dishonourable to his person, and destructive to his Authority. Truly my Lord, answered Roxana , as my thoughts are in a Wood about the actions of the times; so no doubt but some mystery waits upon the issue, however I must confesse my fears outgo my faith, in any good they mean the Kings power, since both the delayes used, and much more these Articles presented, are no good Omens to Euarchus prosperity; but take off rather that glory which Farezius should have obtained to himself, if he had made the Kings restoration to his Rights his first and chiefest work; since by his power and authority, the rest of the necessary affairs of the Kingdom, would in all probability have been better and surer settled, when they should have carried with them both Law and Justice. You are in the right Madam, said Creses , wherefore if I may not be thought over tedious to your patience, I will discourse to you some things which I have not onely heard from the Kings own mouth, when I last waited upon him; but other observations I took when I was in Syria , out of which you may make what conjectures you please. So taking the old woman by the hand, he led her to a little Banquetting-house, not far off for the more privacy; where, after they were both seated, he made unto her this relation. Madam, said he, first you must understand, that Euarchus the King is opposed in his just Government, or rather legal authority, by four factions, that for the present seek to undermine one another, all having absolutely in their hearts, cast off their obedience to the Kings Person and Prerogative. The Senate strives with violence to maintain that Jurisdiction, it hath extorted from him; as the Myssians endeavour out of a high covetousness, to be sharers in the Government and Riches of this flourishing Kingdom, neither wants the Army pretentions, by reason of the service they have done in the late Wars, to claim reward and subsistance. And last of all, the wealthy City of Sardis , in regard it hath for the most part furnished the Souldiers and Councell with money, requires to be made a free Town; that is to say, to depend upon no subjection, but what Magistrates created by themselves shall prescribe. This contention of all sides, is the chief occasion as it is thought, that makes every thing at a stand; whilst in the mean time, the people seem to cry out, being over-burthened with oppressions and payments, which in the end certainly cannot but turn to an absolute confusion, since there is scarce possibility left to satisfie all parties: And thus much shall suffice for the common state of things. Now concerning the proceedings of Syria , which I have most from the Kings own mouth, be pleased to understand, that when he was forced to assemble this great Councell, that hath proved so unfortunate to his happiness, there was sent into Lydia from Philostros an Ambassadour, as Euarchus imagined for his consolation and assistance, against the violent proceedings of his Senate; but presently after his arrival, he was so far from complying with the Kings occasions, that he kept a frequent correspondence, with those persons, that seemed most to oppose his Authority; insomuch, as the King was constrained at last with some violence, not onely to forbid him any longer attendance upon his person; but earnestly to desire the State of Syria , to recall him home from all further employment in Lydia , which settled the thoughts of Euarchus in some quietness, whilst his own victories over his disobedient subjects, and the death both of Philostros and Orsames , gave the King more then probable hopes of a finall and happy successe in his enterprize; which was again in a very short time, to reduce all Lydia under his lawfull jurisdiction: But belike the State of Syria following the same maximes of Government, under the young son Orsames had left behinde him, contrary to all humane expectation, sent presently after the death of Orsames another Ambassadour to Euarchus , not onely anew to invite him to break the League, which he still continued with the King of Egypt , but to allow his contesting Senate to be a lawful and continued Councel, by his absolute approbation; thinking belike, that it would better conduce to the affairs of Syria , to have Euarchus power limited, then to suffer him to remain in his high prerogative? But these demands the King most violently and disdainfully refusing, the Ambassadour not onely with some seeming discontent took his leave, but as it was thought invited the Myssians again into Lydia , which hath been as you know the reason of Euarchus overthrow, since the Senates single power had never probably prevailed against his fortune and success; however the business did not yet rest: for after the King had notwithstanding struggled with infinite difficulties, to make good still his declining Cause, (his son Arethusius Forces also being destroyed in many set Battles, who after fled into Syria to the Queen his Mother) Euarchus was forced to put himself under the protection of the Myssians Army; yet with so little benefit to his affairs, that in a short time after he was delivered in person into his Enemies hands, who treated him with all manner of hardness, until the Army took him violently from that jurisdiction: As this Madam, is the sad particulars I can relate unto you of the Kings misfortunes and captivity, so may you very well make conjecture of the consequences. Roxana after she had thanked him for his discourse, wherein as she said, he had made her acquainted with some passages, she never understood before, yet he should oblige her much more if he would be pleased to deliver his opinion, what might be the intentions of the Syrian State, in thus desiring to lessen, or rather in outward appearance to overthrow the Monarchy of Lydia , since the example seemed of a dangerous consequence for its own Government, for that those Subjects might also fall upon the like pretences. Truly answered Creses , what I can say of that Theam is, that either they think it more convenient for the glory of Syria , to reduce all Kingdoms but their own into Commonwealths, whereby theirs might appear to Asia the onely Empire: Or they have an intention to make a conquest of ours, by reason of those multitudes of divisions they see arising amongst our selves; or perhaps they aim to set up Prince Arethusius in his Fathers Kingdom, because he is of the Syrian Blood, whereby they believe they shall purchase both honour and friendship. But if I thought I should not prove over harsh in my unpolisht language, whereby too much to injure your patience by my tedious relation, I would discover yet a story, though acted long time since, that in my opinion, hath been the original of the sad effects of this last War: It will prove the longer, in regard it toucheth the proceedings, not onely of the Kingdom of Lydia , but the Countries of Syria and Myssia , that formerly have been all three interwoven in dangers, slaughters, and Civil Broyls, by the spightful proceedings, and factious maximes, of a certain Priest called Herenzius . Roxana glad to entertain any conveniency that might instruct her father, in the Mysteries of these unlucky times, although many things she had read of Herenzius violent spirit, told Creses , that as no language proceeding from his lips, could prove tedious to any ear how ignorant soever; so did she not doubt, but the consequence of the present affairs, required rather ample stories, then short descriptions, which gave him a sufficient warrant to use his own pleasure, both for the manner and matter of his discourse, until his endeavours produced this following relation. You must know, said he, that this Priest Herenzius some years since, when all the world seemed to yield obedience to the great Flamin of Delphos , as the onely Oracle upon earth to prescribe the manner of the Worship of the Gods, suddenly started up in the Kingdom of Syria , who by reason of an ignominious punishment he had undergone (as 'twas reported for a hainous offence committed against Humane and Divine Laws) began violently to fall out with Heaven and Earth; insomuch as in the first place, he quarrelled with the form of the Service to the Gods then used; and in the latter, he denyed Kings and Princes Obedience, or rather Loyalty from their natural Subjects: To this purpose to execute his malice against all authority, because he had suffered by it; and withal thinking again in some sort to recover his lost reputation, in doing notable actions, how wicked soever, of a sudden flew to a certain Town upon the Confines of Arabia , whose people had newly, not onely disobeyed their Flamin , but cast off their Government to his Authority, which quickly gave him admittance, with his Doctrine, since they knew his opinions suited with their designs: yet being rather friendly entertained, then perfectly established by their welcome, his insolency and pride in a short time, banished him again from the City, seeing he could not shew temper in his first entrance; and so remained until the fear of the Inhabitants, of coming once more under their old Government, for that they understood their Prince prepared for a Siege, constrained them, not onely a new to desire his company, whereby to be assisted by his Councel, but were forced to binde themselves by a solemn Oath, to submit absolutely their wills to his institutions. With these conditions he became fully possessed of that power, that gave him opportunity, both to govern as he pleased, and instruct as he listed, until he had fitted all their thoughts, for the impressions of his designs, by the eloquent language and cunning practices he used; which in a short time so prospered, that many disciples were found of such towardly dispositions, instructed by his principles, that he sent many of them also into other Countries, to poison the peoples loyalties, since obedience is the most assured tye, that probably warrants the safety and prosperity of Kingdoms. But these men having, as I said, taken their journeys with these intentions, the first prevailing progress they made, was in the Countrey of Myssia , where finding some discontents already ingendering between the young Queen then reigning, Grandmother to Euarchus , and some factious and ambitious Nobility, soon introduced their new and dangerous opinions, into the hearts of the common people; by which means the Lords became also so powerful by their assistance, that the poor Princess in a short space, was forced to quit both her Kingdom and Life, (a Tragedy too pittiful now to be related) whilst the Rebels took possession of her Authority; from which usurpation proceeds Lydia's miseries, since by a continuance of the same desires in those people towards her posterity, they have now filled this Kingdom with tumults, troubles, and blood, the better to make good their own jurisdiction, so unlawfully purchased in former times: But however, these opinions of deposing of Kings, and altering the Worship of the Gods, prevailed entirely in Myssia , by reason of those crafty and factious actors that Herezius had sent; yet his Doctrine found not so ready acceptance in the Kingdom of Lydia , for that the Queen then reigning, endeavoured against the violence of all their endeavours, both to conserve Monarchy, and maintain their Flamins , though the State altered many tenents in Doctrine; until the late agreements of each Nation to oppose Euarchus in the same design, contrived an accord to extirpate in effect both King and Flamins: This may pass my discourse to the Kingdom of Syria , that hath not onely formerly borne part in the suffering, by reason of these opinions sowed in the world, but hath been a principal occasion to give the Myssians protection, by whose power Euarchus hath been chiefly destroyed. To which purpose you must understand, that although Herezius other messengers, could not so easily beat down the strong Walls of Monarchy, established by so many ages in Syria , against the power of great Armies alwayes kept in pay by that Nation, yet oftentimes they filled the whole Kingdom with most lamentable slaughters, to gain entrance for their opinions, and freedom for their Doctrine; insomuch as the Prince himself then governing, finding the Temples overthrown, his Countrey spoiled, and his Subjects destroyed by the fury of the contention, was forced at last, so far to give way to the Herezians Religion in Syria , that they had not onely granted them, a free exercise of their Consciences throughout all his Dominions, but many fortified Towns were delivered into their hands; wherein they put their own Garrisons, to secure better this agreement, which both afforded him peace, and seemed to give them satisfaction for the present: however, every year almost after (notwithstanding these benefits) produced new stirrs by that faction, to the disquieting of the Kingdom; that gave sufficient cause of vexation to many good Princes, since they could not be assured of the loyalty of their obliged Subjects; nor of the continuation of their own prosperities, when neither graces could win them by reason of the spleen they bore to Monarchy, or power could compel them in regard of those Forts they had in their custody. But to be short, before the great and wise Favourite Philostros durst take upon him the huge worke he intended, which was to suppress the gloriousness of the Egyptian Empire, he imagined he could not be absolutely safe at home, and so consequently not fitted for so large a Conquest, as long as he should leave behinde him in his own bosom so eminent a danger, as those he esteemed lawless Subjects in Orsames Kingdom, knowing they would upon all occasions, be ready to joyn with Forreign Forces, to overthrow their own Kings Government; therefore resolved first before he undertook any new design, to subdue their power, to the absolute obedience of his great Masters jurisdiction, as in times past it had been to some of his predecessors; to which purpose he not onely suddenly besieged the strongest Town they had in Syria , but within a short space, left them never a Fort in the whole Kingdom, that was not constrained to deliver up the Keyes of its Gates, to the will and pleasure of fortunate Orsames , who began to grow great in the opinion of the world, by the conquest of his own Subjects, that were accustomed to give sufficient imployment to other Kings. However, after that Philostros had made this speedy progress in glory, as well as in security for his Masters apparent advantage, both in quieting his Subjects at home, and terrifying his Enemies abroad, which proved mighty advantages for those designs he had contrived in his politick brain, because it was not convenient, and scarce safe to continue desperate discontents in so dangerous a body, that had vastly spread it self through most Countries in Asia , whilst his thoughts and endeavours were otherwise to be imployed; he began by little and little, to smooth his brow towards that Sect, and at last not onely assured them of his absolute forgetting all faults past, but made many of them chief Officers and Commanders in that Army, Orsames provided to go against the Egyptian Forces, wherein he craftily procured a double commodity to his affairs, the one in winning a party he had good cause to suspect, and the other in rendering them ingaged in the quarrel he intended against Sorastros ; besides he was most assured, that they would fight with spleen against that Religion by nature they most hated, since the Egyptians of all others were held most obsequious to the Rites and Ceremonies of Delphos , which also was a means to binde the Myssians to the Affairs of Syria , since no Nation or people in Asia , professed more violently the same Worship of the Gods introduced by Herenzius , and exercised by his followers in Orsames Dominions; which were not onely reasons to tye Philostros to that Sect, by all the favours he could procure it in his own Countrey, whereby to make them serviceable in the Wars he had with Sorastros , but by that means gave countenance to the Myssians against Euarchus their lawful Prince; which by consequence afforded the Senate of Lydia conveniency also to suppress his power, that they might not seem to go less in jurisdiction in mastering their King, then those people they had bought with their money, onely to do them service; so that by this means the Favourite gave work enough at home to Euarchus , that he should not have the opportunity (although he might have the will) to assist the King of Egypt , which the policy of every Nation requires according to some opinions, when a Prince is not able to make good his party against another prevailing Monarch. This Madam, as I say, hath been the fate of these mighty Kingdoms, onely troubled by the cunning industry of one factious and ambitious Priest, as if the Gods had sent him into the world to let man see his own frailty; and the rather for that Euarchus not many years ago, appeared so glorious and fortunate in his Government, crowned with a flourishing prosperity, in Wife, Children, Peace, and Power, that he was not onely the absolute envy of all Asia , but seemed to carry in his hand the arbitration of the world; being now cast down into so low, and I may call it miserable condition by a little faction of his own people, that he is not onely denyed to be a King, but deprived of the comfort of all that ever was his; with an addition of a sharp and lasting captivity, according to the discretion sometimes of his meanest Subjects; whilst in the interim, Honour, Love, Justice, and Gratitude seem to be laid asleep in the deep center of the earth: other Princes onely watching to their own preposterous spleen, not considering how soon it may be their fortunes, to fall under the same Fate, for that all men naturally covet liberty: With these words he rested silent with his armes across, as if yet his imagination went higher then his tongue was able to express. This discourse gave the old woman also some leasure to shed a few tears, in considering the Kings misfortunes. But as he was proceeding farther, they were both interrupted by the sudden arrival of the little dwarf, who told Roxana , that he had been a long time searching her all over the Park, to inform her, that the Princess was newly descended into the Garden, to take some recreation before dinner, and desired earnestly her company, to impart something of consequence to her knowledge: This gave Roxana no more opportunity, then civilly to thank Creses for those informations he had given her, professing again she was instructed in many things she had never heard before, that might afford light, as she said, to her comportment and conversation, since she was daily to dispute with some enemy or other in Euarchus quarrel, and withal desired him he would be pleased, to put on a resolution often to accompany her in that place, not onely for her better information, but for her Mistrisses consolation, which you may be sure was a tickling motive to invite Creses to the service, being perswaded, the Princess should partake of his discourse; and love speaks the most effectual language, though it want never so much probability to enjoy. Roxana when she came into the Garden, she found the Princess retired into a close walk, defended by interwoven branches of green leaves from the Suns oppression, which also obscured her in some sort from the sight of her attendants; so that the old woman had occasion given her by that retirement, to believe new accidents had caused the solitude: Wherefore approaching at a nearer distance, she might perceive a paper in Cloria's hand, whilst she stood still lifting up her fair eyes to the Heavens, then again cast them down upon the ground, and in this posture advanced two or three steps, with a kinde of a violent motion: This continued Roxana the longer before she discovered her being there, until the Princess turning that way, she was necessarily invited to present her self; however she had not come near her by a few paces, but Cloria with a deep sigh, instead of other expressions, cast her the paper she held, which the old woman presently reading, found it spake this matter.  Madam, as I should not for a long season, have omitted those services due to your person by many visits, that my love and your vertues required, if the distempers of these times, had not proved prohibitions beyond my ability to resist, since I durst not contend with the power of the General, whose will I found absolutely obeyed: So now having an unexpected occasion to give you advertisement, I cannot again but present my dear affections to your sacred self, hoping that my former love is not altogether out of your remembrance, not onely since the Senate begins anew to possess themselves of their ancient Authority, but that the King your Frther is lately fled from the protection of the Army, though by whose means, or to what region cannot yet be learned by any examination. Your most humble Servant, and faithful Lover,  Roxana after she had read the Letter, stood still sometime in a Muse, until at last passionately she broke out into these words: Truly Madam, said she, as I cannot but smile at the former part of the writing, so must I needs wonder at the latter, since it seemeth as preposterous, Prince Cassianus should after a long silence, attempt your love, when he remained quiet during the Generals supposed greatness, as it appears stranger to my thoughts, the King hath now removed his Quarters, when he was supposed secure in Farezius protection. But alas, said Cloria , I rather marvel whither my Father can possibly be fled to purchase more hopes, for that all the Kingdom is probably out of his jurisdiction; therefore I should be glad to flatter my self with some opinions, that the design was undertaken upon good grounds. As I cannot promise that answered Roxana , yet certainly the King being so wise, would never have ventured upon such a dangerous attempt, without long consideration, and assured friends to conduct him to his journeyes end; yet if I may rove according to my wilde imagination, either he is gone into Syria , since I cannot believe he would any more trust his person with the Myssians , who have divers times deceived him; or is invited into Crete by his Subjects there in Arms against the Senate the better to make good their cause against the new Lydian Forces, preparing to bring them speedily under subjection. The Gods will be done, said the poor Princess, but I fear the worst: These discourses brought them to the rest of the company in the Garden, to make them also sharers of the unexpected news. Roxana the next morning had scarce leasure given her to welcome the day, when she was advertised by a messenger sent from Creses , that within two hours space, he would attend her if she pleased at the Banquetting-house amongst the Woods, not onely to finish out the rest of their discourse, but also to let her know other passages worth her acceptance. The old Matron conceiving, it was some intelligence more particular concerning the Kings departure, sent him thanks, and promised with all diligence to wait upon the summons, which she performed a pretty while before Creses arrival, that gave her opportunity to examine her own imagination, but it was not long before she was interrupted by his appearance, which with a few ceremonies seated them both together as the day before, whilst Creses used this language. Though I may suppose (said he) you have heard something of the Kings departure from under the protection of the Army; yet perhaps you have not as yet been enformed of the reasons and particulars of his retirement; or rather I may call it an escape, since he was perswaded it would be for his better safety: Roxana confessing, she knew nothing of the manner much less the cause, though common fame had brought the report to her ears; Creses gave her this farther account of the passage, according to the relation he had from an officer intrusted in the service as he said. The King, said he, (being not onely suspicious of the security of his person, by reason of the many divisions of opinion in the Camp; some desiring a Prince, others none; especially considering the diversity of humours amongst the common Souldiers, who generally laboured for an universal equality; as also being credibly enformed, that unless he would presently condescend to those propositions formerly sent unto him, with the addition of some priviledges demanded, that were more destructive to his Crown and Dignity, he should infallibly be murthered) was constrained to this sudden retirement; however I must tell you these rumours were given out as 'twas believed, onely to fright him to seek another station, where he might be again imprisoned with some colour and better security, as pretending his intention was to escape out of the Armies jurisdiction and power: So that the poor King finding causes enough for a suspicion, acquainted two of his servants, both with his fears and intentions, who to be short, perswaded him to fly to an island upon the borders of Caria , where remains as Governour a valiant Commander, though formerly imployed by the Senate, yet at the present was conceived to be wholly at the dispose of Farezius and the Army: This Captain they assured him would be entirely faithful to his designs, though upon what grounds I can neither inform you or satisfie my self, since the consequence proved otherwise; for no sooner was the King arrived under his jurisdiction, but he entertained him, not onely with a sad and sowre countenance, but after he had secured his person in the Castle, and sent away his two Officers, he presently gave information to the Senate of all the proceedings, desiring further directions in what manner he should be treated; though he carries still in his demeanour, a kinde of a reverence to his dignity: All these passages as I told you before, I have from one of those persons newly returned, that accompanied him in the journey; with this advertisement also, that before the Kings departure from the Camp, he left in his Chamber under his own hand, the reason of his fears and his escape: All which Madam I may say is in such a mist, that no less a knowledge then some Divine Oracle, can inform us concerning the certainty of the mystery; onely we may be confident, that Euarchus hath imployment enough for his courage and patience. At these words Roxana wept again, with the very sense of the Kings dangers and miseries: Nay said Creses , his sufferings of all sides are so extream, that notwithstanding he hath sent to Farezius , and offered to accord every difference and interest in the Kingdome, being heard; yet neither the General nor Senate will entertain the motion, or allow him that priviledge, fearing belike he should speak too much reason to render his Subjects satisfied, whereby they might be endangered, to lose that authority, which now they possess without contradiction. But said Roxana , why do the common people desire violently no King, since Euarchus shews such testimonies of his goodness? Truly said Creses , as that opinion in the General is erronious, since all be not of that faction, so of the other side, there be too many that wish an universal equality, not considering the confusion it would bring upon the whole Kingdom, being as it were bewitched with an ignorant pride; for most of them by such a parity, would be in more slavery then they are now, since they could never be capable of any command, and necessarily must obey those, that would govern with more rigour, though elected from amongst themselves: Besides they are now so weary of the Senates rule in the same posture, having had some experience of their managing affairs hitherto, that they believe their own cure, can proceed from nothing but desperate change, which is incident to all distempered mindes; since they, that could not be well under Euarchus peaceable Government, wherein they enjoyed all wealth and prosperity (though no doubt but there was some abuses) certainly now will not rest satisfied, when they shall feel nothing but want, oppression, and instability; besides many fear, that things are not yet at the worst, when so many contrary interests with violence seem to contend. These discourses brought them both at last in dispute, whether active valour, or passive courage, were the greater vertue, in that Euarchus seemed to possess them both in a high kinde. But Creses who had a dainty wit, defended the latter with these arguments: First, said he, before we can well consider with what hath been the Kings sufferances, we must rightly state his misfortunes, which will appear to be the greater, when it is well known to the world, he hath alwayes shewed courage in the Wars, by venturing boldly his person upon all occasions, as also eloquence and judgement both by his Pen and Language, when those faculties of Art and Nature were thought necessary and useful; a plain demonstration that he wants not sense and knowledge, fully to apprehend his own oppressions; and the rather may it be so thought, for that those who have most gained by his favours, the ungrateful Myssians , with some others of his own Court, have been the chief instruments, or rather I may say the onely cause that have deprived him, not onely of the priviledge of his Royal Crown, but of all the personal happinesses he enjoyed in his prosperity; besides his want of liberty now at last to make up the full Catastrophe of his misery, none almost giving ear to his complaints, or pittying his captivity; though they have separated him from his beloved Queen, in whose beauty and vertues he took an unspeakable felicity, as also the comfort of beholding his sweet Children, being a real part of himself, which the Gods and nature have ordained to man, as a humane right; accompanied with the detention of his revenues, that should maintain him and them; besides prosecuting him with as many slanders as they can invent. This Madam as it may be supposed, being the true condition of Euarchus misfortune, it may easily be conjectured, his sufferings are equal, if not go beyond example; and yet his noble heart holds out still to endure as you see, what malice can invent without breaking; who notwithstanding offers love, mercy and patience to his whole Kingdom and worst injurers: things being in this posture, I shall proceed to the making good of my promised argument; which is, that passive courage is a greater vertue then active valour, if my discourses do not seem too tedious for your more necessary imployment. As I must call the Kings constancy a noble Fortitude, since he hath neither subject of hope, nor object of diversion, so certainly is it the highest magnanimity for a Prince, to suffer patiently and without confusion from his own Subjects, that owe him duty and gratitude; for those men that hazzard their lives freely indesperate services, either aim at Victory or Conquest, by which they intend to purchase gain or glory, which enflames their bloods with continual agitation, that scarce gives leasure to reflect upon the dangers, much less time for cold and apprehensive consideration; and yet we see, such have for the most part need of noise of Drums and sound of Trumpets, to waken their courages, or lay asleep their fears, to continue them the better in action; whereas suffering hath nothing to help or comfort it, since the minde is still prepared to entertain the misery it sustaineth, with a pale expectation of the same or worse, when as I say, it is known it must be endured without hope, having no diversion: like a person sick in the night, wanting objects of variety, thinks that season longer and his torment greater by much then in the day time; for where the minde is kept high by ambition to compass something it coveteth, it hath power enough in that interim to hold up the body from falling to its proper center the earth, where naturally it inclines: But being without comfort, if a man do not make strong use of his noble part his soul, to maintain his courage and resolution, the suffering or captivating of flesh and blood, will render a man quickly totally overcome; and that is the reason, that long and tedious persecutions, have destroyed more competent spirits, then sharp and violent tortures, since they were prepared for the one with expectation, and onely wearied by the other with continuance. We know that old men strive more greedily, to preserve their lives that short time they are to live, then young men in their most flourishing years; because diversity of prospects operates so much in youthful bosoms, by reason of continual activity tending that way, that they have not leasure to settle their imaginations upon horrid apprehension; when old people have so much time to think (wanting power of action) that the object which is natural, appears often before their eyes to fright them; and so fares it with a person that onely suffers, in comparison of him that doth both suffer and act together: Wherefore that person hath need of a double courage, because there is nothing to accompany his thoughts of variety or diversion; for certainly it pleaseth a man rather to contend for his life, though he know he shall be deprived of it, then to lose it without any strife at all; which seems to be the case of Euarchus , since they will not so much as permit him with reason to dispute his rights, but force him unheard to deliver up his Crown; and more grievous a great deal is his condition, in that he appears to be left of all those friends, that have been most obliged to his goodness. What is the reason that a Delinquent upon the Scaffold, is accustomed to have his eyes banded before the stroak of death, but to take away from him the apprehension of the blow, which he knows he shall receive? When a valiant Souldier in the Field without shadow, will charge against a thousand Weapons, with as much certainty of destruction, because the ones actions frees him from the others terrour: All which shew, that a sad expectation of an ill, augments the suffering, when a diversion by imployment of the body, or busying the senses by diversity of objects, take away that apprehension that makes any danger or misery excessively horrid; as for example, men for the most part are put to torture in uncouth places, where there is nothing but silence, or low whisperers, to render the sufferer more sensible of the pain, by the quieting of the imagination; and so it fares with such as pass through dark places, being afraid of every small rustle, when in the day time, the same way perhaps is pleasant: So that as without doubt, all smart, grief, and discontents, is encreased by want of action and too much leasure for consideration; so I must conclude, that it is a great deal easier for a person to dye fighting in the Field, though he should be cut assunder in a thousand pieces, then to endure a long and tedious captivity, which is Euarchus present condition; insomuch as at last, if he should in some sort yield to this cruelty, I must not finde fault with his courage, but if he gain the Victory, I shall esteem him a miracle of nature. As I will not, said Roxana , go about to disprove your arguments, grounded upon such reasons, and more, delivered by the known authority of your excellent judgement, so of the other side I could wish, the King had some Counsel to assist him in these difficulties, besides his own capacity and courage, since it is impossible, but humane nature at the length will be tired with over-much suffering; and by consequence fail for want of true information: I am of your opinion said Creses ; but such is the crafty spight of some, that they will permit none to be about the Kings Person, that dares loyally afford him any profitable consolation, because they may the sooner bring him to consent to their desires: Yet replyed Roxana , it is not well known what those desires are, since they never durst for all I could ever learn, publickly declare their intentions, but do as it were in a dark mist, endeavour to possess the people, that the King refuseth something he is obliged to grant for the good of his Subjects; by which means they strive still to maintain their credits and opinions amongst the common sort, It is so Madam said Creses ; however, since you are fallen upon that point, I shall let you know how far the King hath yet condiscended to their demands, whereby the better to dispossess the people of that belief, they are perswaded to have in the Senates integrity; though I verily think, they now more fear their power, then trust their intentions; for whereas not many dayes ago, they proposed to Euarchus , to have the power of the force of the Kingdom for twenty years, both by Sea and Land, the King hath yielded to grant them that jurisdiction during his life, though not for that term, which appears how to be the greatest difference between them, since the Senate seems not content with this offer: Whereupon the Myssians have lately put out a furious declaration against the Senate pressing the King to such unreasonable conditions: In good earnest answered Roxana , I cannot tell, whether I have more cause to smile at the seeming ridiculousness of these proceedings, or be amazed to see men grown so foolishly unreasonable, since Euarchus appears to my understanding, to be willing to part with more from his own hopes, then what the Senate requires; for that if he grant the power of the Kingdom out of his hands during his life, it gives more assurance to the Senate, that he intends no more to reign, then if he had quitted his power, for so many years onely, since he might have some thought to over-live that prescribed term; again for the Myssians , I wonder most of all at their new loyalty to their Prince, when they have been, as I may say, the onely cause that hath made him no King, though now anew, they seem to desire to re-establish him in his ancient Authority; which certainly cannot be but upon other designs of advantage to themselves, more then for Euarchus prosperity. Truly Madam said Creses , in the general it is as you say, but yet there are so many mysteries hid under these proceedings, that they are capable to deceive the sharpest judgement, if some light be not given by information; wherefore you must know, that both Euarchus and the Senate know very well, that the consequence of all the affairs chiefly depend upon the assurance of the safety of the Kings Person, since he can never hope to be again re- established in his rightful Authority, but either by the humours and inconstancy of the common people, who when they finde the Kings absolute oppression brings no prosperity to them, will probably become exasperated against the Senates proceedings and power, or by an unreconcilable difference between the Senators themselves, who may most command, when they shall finde no other jurisdiction to oppose them: both which in all likelihood will conduce to the Kings benefit, if he sit quiet sometime under his injuries, which I conceive to be the reason, that he hath in outward appearance yielded so much to their demands. And for the Myssians perhaps by this opposition, they would perswade the world to a belief of their integrities, as if at the first they consented not to the Kings hard usage, whereby to obtain a greater party, not onely in the Kingdom of Lydia , if they have an intention to dispute their own profit, but in other Countries if they mean to make War upon our people, because they cannot be sharers in the Government as they hoped, the onely cause certainly of the now seeming quarrel: So that in my opinion, Euarchus hath done like a wise and Politick Prince, in seeming not to contend, where he was sure not to prevail; especially since by the dispute, he might have endangered those hearts, that will now be of his side if the occasion be offered, either out of pitty to his sufferings, or out of hate to the Senates Government: And besides, it is to be considered, that no Act he shall pass in this condition of constraint, can binde either himself or posterity by all Humane and Divine Laws, if his Sword ever become more powerful. In the mean time, the Senate will seek to preserve the Kings Life and Person with their best care, since their own authority falls entirely by his death, which as I lay is the reason, they desire more a term of years in the continuation of their required Government, then the determinable fate of the Princes life, because they may have alwayes the liberty to press him to new conditions, if they finde by experience, they have not yet obtained sufficient; since they shall not need to fear the vectations of his person, may bring any hazzard upon him. I cannot deny, said Roxana , but these reasons are sufficient to render me wholly satisfied in my doubtful opinions, but the Gods are onely capable to foresee the event of things; and with that looking upon the Sun, she perceived the time of the day, called her to the attendance of the Princess, which made her for the present take her leave. Upon her arrival, she found Cloria onely accompanied by her Lute, in a small withdrawing room belonging to her own chamber, where none but her self had permission to be admitted: Not long after she had saluted the Princess, she discovered she had been weeping, by the red circles about her eyes, that gave the old woman occasion further to be inquisitive after her employment; until she spyed this complaining Ditty, lying written before her upon the Table, that quickly gave her satisfaction of the occasion, though her excellent voice and rare skill rendred the Musick heavenly.  If Justice could some favour finde, Or were not rather truly blinde; Ambition sure durst never wear, The spoils of such a vertue here, When every hour Doth need her power To set both Crowns and Kingdoms free. For Love I see is but a flame That onely bears a constant name; And is by interest as a wave, Tost here and there as others crave, If objects seem Of more esteem To summon sense unto the call. But whatsoever dwells more high, Shoot but your Commets from the skie, Against the hate that mortals bear, To such as lawful Scepters wear, And we'll adore For evermore, That action as a Deity. Yet whilst that fate and pride contend, Whether shall conquer at the end, The Gods themselves have cause to fear, A revolution of the Sphear, And then like we May Martyrs be In the vaste Chaos of the fall. But the Princess after she had made an end of her Musick, began with many complaints and more sighs, to blame absent Narcissus for his too much negligence in his Love; since in all this time of her last restraint, he had not found as she said some disguise to visit her person, though he might want the power to procure her liberty: which she continued with a certain passion, until Roxana not onely chid her for those sad expressions, that as she told her had destroyed in part the ravishing delight of her Song, but seemed unjust in accusig her servant, that had in so many dangerous adventures, shewed alwayes the entire constancy of his affection; who was no doubt at the present retired into some Region, where he might best advantage her service. However Cloria was willing up any hopes, to be satisfied with the proceedings of Narcissus , and much more with his intentions; yet could she not but tell Roxana , that although she was pleased to be his advocate, that seemed to have a powerful perswasion in her belief, yet were the loves she feared from Farezius , and the importunities she expected of Cassianus , in her apprehension, arguments sufficient to make her think Narcissus wanted much diligence, at leastwise violence, that he did not endeavour to scale the very walls, where she remained a prisoner, rather then to endure her to be so injured. Truly Madam, answered Roxana , as I cannot tell why you should expect miracles instead of services, so have you no cause to doubt the importunities you mention, since I am not certain Farezius love was ever presented to your liking, either from himself, or any of his instruments: And for the Addresses of Cassianus , you have been already so accustomed to refusals, that I conceive you have not any other hard part to play, then to continue the same course still; Besides, you may well remember by Cassianus own Letter, that his affections are not so hot, as to press you upon over- great inconveniences, and therefore in my opinion, you may very well quiet your thoughts concerning his Courtships. O Roxana , said the Princess, you are much deceived in both these particulars; for as to my knowledge (which I have understood since I saw you last) Farezius hath already intimated his desire to my father, whom you may be sure will comply, almost in any thing that concerns the General, so doth Cassianus labour the Senate underhand, to be propitious to his love; since as he sayes, their own honours are engaged in the issue, for that the world takes notice of their protestations, which are to see him established in a prosperous condition both in power and affection: And the rather as he pretends, for that they formerly sent for him, according to their professions, to see them put in execution. Roxana replyed, as there be many reasons of sufficient force to make me give way to your opinions, since your own beauty, honour, and vertues, are loadstones attractive enough to intangle all the world in an intricate labyrinth of love and desire, notwithstanding what difficulties soever, yet it cannot but seem most strange to my thoughts, that Farezius low condition, though his fortune hath been eminent, should aspire to such a supream excellency with any hope to enjoy. Hold your self content woman, said the Princess, there is no limitation of felf-love and ambition, when they have once taken possession of a proud heart, though covered with never so mean an extraction; and you know that Farezius is a Gentleman, which joyned with his former success in the Wars, and his present command now in the Army, cannot want perswasions, to make him attempt any enterprize for his own glory; especially since the King seems meerly to depend upon his assistance, or allowance, for his future prosperity; and being so, what counsel can you give me, either to prevent his violence, or instruct his passion; since I dare not be too bold, in hazzarding my fathers fortunes by provoking the Generals spleen by a harsh and disdainful denial. In good sooth, said Roxana , I am very glad to see, you have learned some temper since you were in the possession of Osiris , where, as you may remember, I had much ado to perswade you to entertain reason, or continue in patience, wishing then, you had hazzarded a thousand deaths, rather then have dissembled your love in any kinde: But perhaps Narcissus is now farther from your remembrance, though nearer your person: No by all the immortal Gods, answered the sweet Princess, my affection is as pure and constant as it was in Osiris Court, if not encreased by the effects of more trials, to render it absolutely judicious; onely the consideration of my fathers present captivity, and future danger, makes me so far willing to dispence with my own dear love, as to mask it over with some hypocrisie, for his sake, which formerly I was unwilling to purchase with the assurance of my own life, when I remained in the City of Memphis ; onely the consideration, of a necessary jealousie in Narcissus breast, when rumours shall bring such reports to his absent ears, I must confess something deters my resolution, from any dissimulation at all in love, though no way prejudicially to his right or my own honour. Indeed Madam, said Roxana , I do not now onely begin to love you for your wisdom, but will endeavour to put a project into your head, that may both keep your father safe, and perhaps destroy your enemies; at leastwise it will protract if not divert your violent prosecution: Certainly Governess, answered the Princesse, if you prove as good as your word, I shall esteem it the greatest piece of service, that ever your wits produced; since in my opinion, it not onely equals all others in benefit, for that the King as well as my self is concerned in the business, but out-goes the rest in difficulty, considering how many powerfull adversaries you have to deal withall. Well then, said Roxana , sit still and hear my propositions, and afterwards prepare your self without resistance, to put them in execution, though never so much against your appetite; if not return me such arguments as may convert my judgement, as well as satisfie your own fancy: Cloria told Roxana , that her injunction was so reasonable, that it was not to be contradicted by any that had common sense, or was not desperate against their own good; promising withal to be punctual in her obedience, as a principal duty she esteemed her self bound unto, in regard of that charge she had had ever since her infancy over her: and then the old woman began this discourse. For these two Suitors, said she, that seem likely to trouble your patience, and the Kingdoms quiet, since the one commands the Army, as the other is possest of the hearts of the Senate, I make no doubt, but you may oppose their own interest one against the other, if you can dissemblingly but entertain the love of either; by which jealousie certainly there must needs rise discontents and factions, towards your safety and fathers advantage; for if you entertain the addresses of Cassianus , the Souldiers will think their General undervalued, who appears now to the publick view, to carry upon the point of his Sword, the absolute power and strength of the whole Kingdom; and if you accept of Farezius Courtships, no doubt but the Senate will esteem their own authorities dishonoured, since they have proposed Prince Cassianus to be the subject of their chief care: Besides, if Farezius should fail in any thing he attempts, many of the common people would conceive with some violence, that the Senate hath an intention to couzen them out of those priviledges, they have been promised, when their greatest patron shall be debarred of his own desires; and if Cassianus should miss of what he hath hitherto expected, by the Senates liberal offers, the Nobility might very well imagine, that the people and Army endeavoured to become their masters; which would not be lessened by other jealousies already growing between the two factions, since the Nobility doth not onely with all the secret policy they can, seek to curb the insolency of the common sort, who strive for nothing more, then to bring down all dignity to an universall equality, but the multitude have already so far declared their dislike of the Lords proceedings, that publickly they have required to have the authority of their jurisdiction taken away, and made lyable to the peoples allowance; who now enjoy their priviledges, by inheritance from their Ancestors, purchased either by their own merits, or the Princes grace. And last of all, though the factions of the two Rivals should not enflame at the particular disgrace of either Cassianus or Farezius , yet certainly their own swords in a private combat, would be very likely to decide the quarrel; which would give you a fair pretence to refuse the Survivor, that should covet to embrace you with hands imbrued in blood. Governess, answered the Princess, although I should be very glad, to be an occasion to raise any faction for my own present advantage, and my fathers future prosperity, yet I cannot deny but I am most extream sorry to hear of new troubles, whereby the Kingdom should be engaged in more slaughters. You are very pittiful, replyed Roxana , but I pray consider, whether it be not better, to procure the discomposure of those, that have sought all this time by their authority to establish another Government, destructive to Monarchy, whereby of necessity a general confusion must follow; for that it is not probable so many interests can be satisfied, or give occasion to prepare Lydia for the conquest of forreign Forces, since it is impossible your Fathers many Children would be content to sit down quietly with the perpetual loss of their own Birth-rights, extorted from the King by his unruly Subjects, during their minorities; and able enough certainly they will be to contend for their dues, seeing all the Princes of Asia , are interested as well in the example as in their blood. No no Madam, said she, rather dispence with your unprofitable commiseration, then be careless of future safety; for it will be much better now, to destroy these unlawful designs, by a little civil Wars amongst themselves, that would but purge the Kingdom of its corrupt humours, ingendred by excess in pride and prosperity, then in the times to come to expose all conditions to a perpetual slavery, under a tyrannical Government, gained by the power of lawless Souldiers, brought in by other Princes, not acquainted with the natures of our people; much less sensible of their sufferings, since they will onely consider their faults past, and not look upon their miseries present; for they would rather judge them by the manner of subjection of their own Countrey then by the sweetness of the Lydian Laws: wherefore I say you must think, whether of the two Suitors you will make the object of your choice, to render the other jealous of his actions and your favours, whereby some sudden difference may arise between the factions, to bring the sooner confusion into the Kingdom; which certainly is the readiest way again to establish your Father in his right, since the noise of forreign power at present, will not onely be an occasion the better to unite them together to the Kings disadvantage, but at the best hazzard the destruction of all property and Government, since the Sword will be the principal Arbitrator of every mans Right, and the victory a change of his condition. Truly Roxana , said the Princess, as I cannot in my own reason esteem your discourse apocryphal, so of the other side you cannot deny, but that I have been ever willing in all my necessities, to follow your Counsel, and therefore since you have prescribed the Law, certainly the election will be easie; for considering that Farezius hath not yet publickly pretended to my love, at leastwise by any expressions to my self, methinks it would appear some injustice for me to refuse Cassianus Courtships, who hath already as you know a kinde of an engagement from my own mouth, concerning the old Flamin , though he be since destroyed: besides his blood, titles, and condition, more suit with my honour and professions, in which the Nobility of the Kingdom will have the greater share, whose dignities certainly, if it were not for particular ends, would preserve Monarchy; whereas the people and common Souldiers, endeavour nothing more then to destroy it from the face of the earth. Why then Princess, said Roxana , if you be so resolved, I must give you your lesson, But first I will tell you of a third Suitor, who also as best deserving must have some employment, and that is Creses ; one whose affection might merit a requital with your love, if your other engagements, and his own disproportion were not obstacles beyond removal: however, it is your part to trust his fidelity, and reward his trust, especially since his endeavours may bring you advantage as well as himself preferment. Wherefore I will design him to this office though he be not yet privy to my intentions, which is presently to make a Journey into Syria , where the Queen your Mother, and the Prince your Brother both remain, to expect the pleasure of that State concerning your fathers affairs, by which means he shall more particularly be able to inform them concerning the Mystery of your resolutions, that may render the assistance they shall be willing to lend more advantageable; and the rather for that I understand the Countrey of Syria , still entertains an Ambassadour with the Myssians , whose force certainly will conduce much to our projects, if they can be made faithful to Euarchus good, since the least power will infinitely strengthen the faction, that shall shew it self for the King or his Son; and in the journey I intend Creses shall visit the Cretans to see whether they may also be wrought to joyn with our party here at home, which is not improbable, since peace and settlement in Lydia will be an overthrow to their prosperities; for that those people by this Kingdom are esteemed no other then pernicious Rebels: And let Creses alone to act his part, when he is sufficiently enformed of our desires, whose sharp wit and excellent language, cannot be equalled by any messenger can be sent, which are fortunate properties to our purpose; besides his intire love to your sacred self, will be alwayes sure to continue him absolutely faithful, which afterward must be rewarded, either by your Fathers fortunes, or the Queens interest in Syria . Without doubt Governess, said Cloria , you have hit upon a right plot, and the rather for that I hear by a late edict sent from the Senate, (as it should seem upon the Kings flight) they have not onely banished out of the City of Sardis , all my Fathers friends in general, but Creses in particular; as conceiving him extraordinarily interested in the Kings counsel and affairs, for that he brought as you know to the Senate the first propositions of his and the Armies desires. Then Madam, said Roxana , your next work must be, anew to invite Prince Cassianus , by some hopes of your acceptance of his offered Love, which may conveniently be grounded upon the late Letter he sent you, that you have not yet answered; as also upon your discourse to him, when he shewed both affection and diligence in saving the old Flamins life at your request, in which service you exprest so much liking to his person and vertues, that you profest him the next person in your thoughts to Narcissus engagement, whom he will not be perswaded is living; and I shall be very glad still to continue him in that errour, until the designs we have in hand may happily be brought to some fortunate issue, by which means Farezius may be spoiled of the peoples affections, and bereaved of the power of the Army, that now seems to carry him up beyond all other authorities, and so consequently enflames his thoughts above opposition, in what he shall propose, much less wish; though truly for my part I believe, he hath a strong faction against him, not onely by the Nobility by reason of Dimogoras disgrace, and many of the chief Senators fearing their own power, but also in divers Provinces where he hath so long a space quartered his Souldiers without removal, though their own desires, in taking away the power from the Lords, and destroying the Kings Regality, yet hinders them from complaining. Well, well, said Cloria , as we must leave time to discover these hidden mysteries, so will I address my self to put in execution what your wisdom hath prescribed, and to that purpose must enjoyn you to remain here in my absence, until an hours space give you releasement; in which interim I shall endeavour to contrive a Letter to Cassianus (in answer to his he sent me the other day) convenient for our design. But scarce had the Princess remained in her private Cabinet the time limited by her words, but she brought forth a Letter imprinted in a fair character, but written by a much fairer hand, which she giving to Roxana to read, it spake this language.  Couzen, although I can no way doubt of your affection, by reason of so many protestations you have made upon all occasions, able to convert any misbeliever from the strongest opinion to the contrary, since otherwise Honour as well as Religion, should extreamly suffer by so much falshood; yet whether that love or no be of so noble a quality as to merit my regard, is scarce a question, when you dare not before the face of any enemy, own these professions you have so often uttered: Alas, alas Cassianus to what a miserable condition am I brought, when he that my heart would pleasure, is afraid to receive the favour, because he that I have no will to love, is pleased to be angry? What dazling beams proceeding from Farezius greatness, have power to captivate the soul of so illustrious a Prince, whose ancient blood hath filled the veins of all the mighty houses in Asia with lustre and ronown? If I be grown less in vertue then I was, when you first made those large tenders, you ought to express wherein, that I might defend my reputation; but if your inconstancy proceed from fancy, or want of courage, you cannot expect I should remain the same. Cloria.  When Roxana had read the Letter, she told the Princess, that as she did approve the manner of her writing, since it wanted not force to stir up the coldest courage, to that violence which was necessary for their purpose, so did it not give much advantage for future engagement: But however Cloria was not able to hear her words, without letting fall a few gentle tears, not onely to shew, that her heart consented not to the hypocrisie, but her soul melted at the remembrance of her absent Love, though she meant no way to prejudice his Interest; and in this sorrowful posture, gave her Governess commission to send away the paper; whilst she her self quickly retired into her own chamber, at leastwise to content her thoughts, with those hopes she had been perswaded to entertain by Roxana's discourse, though not many dayes did she spend in diversity of contemplations, before she received this answer from Cassianus .  Most admirable Princess, as I cannot but confirm my former protestations by a thousand other new Oaths, not onely to re-assure you of my fidelity in those pure affections I first offered upon the Altar of my heart to your sacred perfections, but must conjure your belief by all the powerfull spells of honour and justice, to be confident that neither the fear of Farezius greatness, or doubt of my own safety, could give the occasion to lessen those respects so justly due from my love to your worth, since I not onely hold the Generalle person of too low a consideration for my thoughts, which are alwayes employed upon that high subject your excellent self, but my life to be of too small a value to be lost in any thing that can possibly be named your concernment. No dear Madam, it was nothing less then the horrour my imagination apprehended to suspect your unvaluable person might be in some danger by the unjust jealousie of the proud Generals fears, to see you adored by any interest, and withal no small doubt, lest your Royal Fathers Rights might again be restrained by his rage, when he should perceive a forreign Prince of his own blood, began new addresses without his leave to any of his posterity, since I believed Farezius aimed alone at the honour to do the King justice: But now finding he hath not onely changed the opinion with his fortune; but that I have a releasement by the powerful warrant of your pen, the Gods shall not withhold my fury from performing those services wherein I will esteem death a purchase, if the fair Cloria do but own the sacrifice of offered. Cassianus.  The Princess could not chuse but read this Letter with a little kinde of trembling, as if she feared what she did not doubt, since the worst she was to expect, as she thought from Cassianus , was to comply with her desire; but it is the nature of all passion, to produce new violences, whether in those things we wish or others we would not have. And so it fared with sweet Cloria , who in a manner dreaded what she had designed to be, because it came. But after a lovely smile had taken possession of that countenance, that for a while put on some distraction, she told her Governess, that although their plot in all appearance had thus far well succeeded, since she perceived her Couzen was won to be sufficiently valiant; yet she made some question, how she was to entertain his presence, when he should make his addresses; for if she should as she said give him but ordinary welcome, he might again fall back from his seeming fury against Farezius ; and if too well, he might expect some greater engagement, then was convenient for her to grant. Truly Madam, answered Roxana , make no scruple to let him have as much as you can spare upon the old score, since my Lord Narcissus appearance at any time, will absolutely blot out the obligation, which you know were the first conditions you treated upon in saving the old Flamius life. I but said Cloria , I should be very sorry any suspected testimony did remain, that so much as intimated my thoughts could ever be perswaded to another choice. In good sooth, said the old woman, your conscience is so tender in matters of love, that I believe when you are married to your servant, you will make a doubt, whether he be the same man or no, and by that means call your affection in question to the raising of some desperate jealousie between you. At these words the Princess smil'd, but was prevented in her reply, by the information she received, that her dinner waited her pleasure. It was not long after this discourse, before Cassianus himself in person came into the Princess Lodgings, not onely in confirmation of the truth of his Letter he had sent, but as it were according to his profession, to obraid Farezius suspected if not pretended love, although Cloria for that present, was so busied by reason of some employment in her chamber with her maid servants, that Roxana was constrained with some complements, not onely to give him entertainment, but to make her Mistresses excuse, which at last seated them both in a withdrawing room belonging to the Princesses lodgings, and that convenience drew on many discourses; amongst which Cassianus was perswaded by the old womans desires, to relate the passages of his own fortunes, with the rest of the Princes of Armenia , pretended to be injured by the usurped power of Artaxes their great King, which he delivered in this manner, as a greater motive by Roxana's means to perswade Cloria's affections. You must know, said he, that after the valiant King of Scythia , had lost his life in the Armenian Wars, in defence of the Princes Rights, who were esteemed oppressed by Artaxes power, a story most sufficiently known to all, my self came into Lydia to demand assistance of Euarchus my Uncle, to recover again my conquered Countrey of Iberia , detained from me by Tygranes Duke of Colchis. Orsames also at the same time, began his Wars against our oppressor, with the same pretentions, since Philostros his powerful Favourite, judged it a work full of piety and justice; however he knew there would be much blood spilt in the quarrel; since as his master was mighty, Artaxes was obstinate, and both ambitious: And to this purpose, not onely prosecuted his design with much violence against the King of Armenia ; but in a short time Orsames gained many Countreys, so that at last, he brought Artaxes to be willing to accept, if not to demand a publique Treaty; whereby as 'twas pretended, Asia again might be reduced to its former happy condition, by the effects of a general peace, since the discomposure of such mighty interests, seemed to threaten the whole world with a fatal destruction; and to this effect, all the injured Princes were called to shew forth their accustomed priviledges, in a City upon the Confines of Syria and Armenia , which was a place chosen as most indifferent for that effect: Where their Commissioners then meeting, and yet remaining with more disputes, then hopes of agreements, gave occasion to the Senate of Lydia to invite me to flye to their protection, as well for present subsistance, as future hopes, since it appeared these two powerful Kings, onely beheld their own ambitions, as the chief object of their considerations, though they pretend a more charitable intention in their actions. But my Lord, said Roxana , as I do not desire to trouble my thoughts with the Rights of other Princes that have little relation to our affaires, but as they may concern your particular, so in regard they may prove over tedious for our intended discourse, since the Princess her self will be likely to surprize us before we have finished, I must entreat the honour onely to be made acquainted with those things, that shall belong to your own Titles; and the rather for that I have heard some disputes formerly to that purpose, which I was not very well able to answer, and should be very glad to be better provided against other arguments of the same nature. Truly Madam, answered Cassianus , as it is impossible for me, to sever in all respects the interests of other Princes from my own, so I will endeavour to avoid what unnecessary discourse may prove either tedious or impertinent; after that Roxana had acknowledged the favour by a few complements, he related these particulars. Although I am confident, said he, that you are competently informed, that my dead Father was dispossessed of his fruitfull Countrey of Iberia for taking up of Arms against the power of Artaxes King of Armenia , yet may not be perhaps sufficiently instructed how Tygranes became possessor of our Countreys, Titles, and Honours: Wherefore be pleased to know, that after my said Father was driven forceably from the possession of the Crown of Mesopotamia , (which he had received by the free election of that people, who found themselves oppressed by the Laws Artaxes had imposed upon their Consciences; as well as many of the Nobility deprived of such Lands belonging to the Temples, in their possessions, which their predecessors had left them, though formerly taken away I must confesse by violence from the Flamines ) and my mother forced to flye to her friends charity for succour and safety, the King of Armenia with the assistance of Tygranes riches, prosecuted so far his begun good fortune, that in a short space he not onely quieted the stirs in his own Dominions, but advanced his power into Iberia ; which being without any support, but what few Forces Euarchus his Father, then King of Lydia , had sent to defend his Daughters Right, quickly became master of what strong places he pleased, until at last he was Lord of the whole; and being in possession he not onely paid that debt he owed to Tygranes , with part of my Lands, but bestowed upon him in requital of his other good services, all our titles and honours, which for many lasting ages had remained in our family, as being the next of kinne. As this cruel injustice killed my father with grief, so after some years, it brought to our assistance the forenamed Scythian Prince, as one sent from the Gods in our apprehension, to teach Artaxes a new law of obedience, to the fortunes of so great a courage; however his date of life became determined by the envious destinies, and we left onely to demand aid of Orsames power, to finish that work that we thought so happily begun to the advantage of the injured Princes; in which number I was to be reckoned the chief, since most eminent both in wrongs and honours, as I may say my particular cause bearing the very name of all the rest: In this design, the Syrians continued a large progress within Artaxes Countreys, until the King himself was forced in a manner by the consent also of Sorastros King of Egypt , to that generall Treaty I formerly mentioned: which notwithstanding all the while, hath onely produced disputations instead of conclusions; for that the War continues still with violence to the ruine of the whole Kingdom, without the benefit of any particular interest, onely began at first by the obstinate pride of Tygranes , that would not restore those rights belonging to my self, which probably might have given satisfaction to the other Princes of our faction: however lately Tygranes being oppressed by the burthen of war in his own Dominions, begins to be more plyant to our desires, and to this purpose many arguments are alledged of either side, to give colour to the unfortunate actions of Souldiers; who are maintained more to satisfie the ambition of the two mighty Kings, then to put us in possession of our rights. Tygranes affirmeth, that as the King of Armenia's gratitude bestowed upon him in recompence of his services done the Crown, those Honours and Lands that belonged to our Family, so the money he hath laid out in the Wars, makes him a lawfull purchaser of that benefit; and therefore in all equity cannot be deprived of them, without a full satisfaction, according to the dammage he hath sustained by those actions. The State of Syria again pretends, that unless my self be restored to my former dignities, the combination which is made with the injured Princes, must of necessity be broken, and so consequently their Kingdom of Syria dishonoured in their agreement; and we further adde, that although Artaxes might have some colour of displeasure against my Father, for taking upon him the Crown of Mesopotamia , and defending the possession in his life time by force of Arms, which however is a Title disputable, yet my self ought not to be esteemed any way guilty of the fault being an infant; and therefore too much injured by such a loss, when instead of enjoying the greatest principality of all Armenia for dignity, I am left naked of honour and subsistance, whilst others of less quality, triumph with those spoils that should adorn my person. In conclusion, not to detain your expectation over long with diversity of relations, although the Kingdome of Syria vows never to lay down Arms, without a full restoration of the Princes rights, yet many Ministers of that State, did underhand conclude a League with Tygranes to my prejudice; which shews particular interest hath the chief preheminency in this War: But since, upon new breaches, the Duke again is fallen off from that agreement; insomuch, as the difference may produce better effects; and the rather do I hope it, for that Tygranes hath lately offered to procure the King of Armenia , to grant me equal honours to those my father hath lost, as himself will be content to deliver up the possession of the Countreys belonging to my right, if a general peace in all Asia , may by that means succeed; provided he be competently satisfied by the State, for those damages he hath sustained by the Wars; in which posture continue our present affairs, without either moving backward or forward, to the amazement of the whole world. Truly my Lord, answered Roxana , it seems to me, nothing more is demanded in the Kingdom of Armenia , then what you have been pleased to mention, since your interests is the bases, upon which the onely occasion of the War hath been builded. It is true said Cassianus , however some differences in points of Religion that the Scythians stand upon, is a kinde of an obstacle also; yet it is thought, the State of Syria can when it pleaseth, moderate that particular: But the truth is, that those contentions that depend upon Egypt and Syria , are of so much consequence to this Treaty, that it absolutely hinders not onely the progress, but success of all the rest, whose ambitions as 'tis thought can never be satisfied, until one of those States perish from its appearing greatness; by which means the other may appear to the world more absolute. By this time the Princess Cloria came into the room, which for the present not onely broke off their discourse, but gave warning to Cassianus to present himself to his most glorious Mistriss, as the chiefest deity his heart pretended to adore; however she, as if nature as well as art had taught a more beseeming quickness then ordinary, fortified with those instructions she had received from her Governess that gave her confidence, prevented her Kinsman Addresses with these words. Cousin, said she, if my necessary imployment hath made me seem rude in that entertainment your kinde visit merited from me, I must desire you, rather to interpret my omission to the presumption I had in those tyes that have united us in blood, then any fault my Governess hath committed in my education, upon which score I am bold to ask your pardon, for your over-long stay in expecting my company. Cassianus finding himself saluted in this manner, not onely contrary to custom, but his own expectation, since formerly all her discourses were rather marks of civility, then testimonies of affection, stood some time amazed, as if his imagination could not be satisfied, in that truth which his ears heard uttered: But after he had a little put off that pleasing distraction, that anew captivated his senses, though in a trembling posture, he returned her this answer. Truly Madam, said he, if the greatest Emperour in the world, had been so bountifully repayed, for whole ages of attendance upon so beautiful a Goddess, certainly he would have made no question of his satisfaction, but rather have given his whole domination of the earth for such a purchase; much less must I esteem my self injured that onely live by your pleasure. O my Lord, answered the Princess, since your expressions flye so high a pitch, I shall begin to think it necessary to defend my reputation against your complements; but yet upon better consideration, I am of opinion it is much safer to confess my self overcome by your courtesie, then venture more blows in so unequal a Combat, where your wit will be sure to have the Victory. And with these words taking him by the hand, she led him into a fair Balcony that had a large prospect over the goodly River of Pactole , where long they had not remained (the Princess in the mean time casting her eyes down the River, upon whose Banks was seated that pleasant house of her Fathers, that first gave Cassianus entertainment when he came into Lydia ) before she used this language, though a sweet showre of tears opened the passage for words: I cannot, said she, but with some grief, remember the innocent times, that gave both you and me meeting in yonder place, when my Father seemed to triumph in glory, that is now unfortunately metamorphosed into a Garrison of Souldiers, who perchance neither honour Dignity, nor know Goodness, much less practise Vertue. Indeed said Cassianus , as I must confess those respects I then received from your most noble Father, and my affectionate Uncle, were far beyond my poor deserts, which gives me more occasion at present to lament his condition, in being subject to such a cruelty, that no power of mine is able to redeem, yet I cannot also but remember my own losses at that time, since even then I quitted the liberty of my soul, that until this present I could never recover again; though I have sought all wayes of redemption: and unless you prove more merciful then the Kings oppressors, I shall not onely remain in as great a captivity, but have cause to accuse you of the like tyranny, though I dare not be so bold in my complaints. But yet Cousin, said Cloria , I must make a great deal of difference in the nature of your sufferings, though I should grant the quality; for as the King hath by all means possible strived to give his oppressors satisfaction, provided it may not be against the right of his Successors, and good of his people; so you of the other side violently aim at your own content, to the injuring perhaps of anothers Title. Alas Madam, answered Cassianus , was I not your first and last lover? the silent Rocks can give sufficient testimonies of the one, when at that famous hunting, I retired under their protections, onely to make my complaints, and the whole Senate can witness the other, by my importunities: Wherefore no interest is to be esteemed equal to my pretensions, either in affection or right. Alas, alas, answered the Princess, you never let me know those powerful affections, before other respects had taken full possession of that heart, which became also in some sort a prisoner not to be released, who perhaps might as well have been your captive, if your omissions had not proved most unfortunate to your purposes. And whereas you say, you are my last lover, I beseech you do but consider Farezius intentions, and look upon his actions, and you will finde both violence and power hath discovered a latter scene, then what you moved in, when you saved the old Flamins life; so that I must tell you, that unless punctually you observe the condition according to your former agreement, which was never to press my love to any conclusion, if Narcissus were living, to whose memory I must still observe that decorum, I vow by the Gods never to entertain any motions from your addresses, much less give any consent to a future marriage: Besides you must perform those actions that may render you capable of satisfaction, as my self freedom in granting; which can never be as long as the General hath opportunity to prevent, and power to constrain. Wherefore in brief, you are to study some opposition answerable to his greatness for both our advantages, whereby the better to merit my love, as to shew your self worthy the name of a Prince of so great an extraction. These discourses of Cloria , could not chuse but nettle the ears of Cassianus , towards the resolution of sufficient ambitions; since hitherto he conceived himself to have been over slothful, as well in her love as his own honour; so that standing some time in a deep muse, as if he intended to fetch his determinations from his very soul, at last he broke out into this language: Most fair and wise Princess, said he, as already I have promised my best endeavours with the expence of my dear blood (in which you have the dearest interest) in your service, against the proud General; so I must be prescribed by your directions, to such limitations and performances as I am to observe, for fear that else my actions may either endanger your safety to be more valued then the worlds Empire, or ruine your Fathers hopes, whose sufferings cannot be exampled. Therefore I beseech you let me know, how far your pleasure may travel, in that journey I intend to make against the pride of ambitious Farezius . Cousin, said Cloria , as I shall leave my Governesses experience, to treat with you about the particulars, so of the other side, I am content to give you these assurances of my affections, that after Narcissus you shall have the next place in my consideration, provided you think of my Fathers sufferings, and be mindful of your own honour, since without him I cannot give away my self, and without your reputation you are but half a Prince. Upon these conditions, you shall finde my lodgings ever ready to entertain your visits, so they may be seasonable and not scandalous; which I believe are favours sufficient to nourish your hopes, according to those expressions you received under my hand in that Letter, your seeming neglect of my condition forced from me; which is all for the present I have to say upon this theam, unless it be to adde to your consideration; how is it possible you can either reap fruits from my affection, if Farezius continue great? or what probability have you again to recover your lost Countrey of Iberia , if all regallity be supprest? since in the one, his greatness may perhaps constrain me to an unwilling consent for my own preservation, as the other by this means, may so fill Lydia with popular desires, that your birth and blood, much less dignity shall finde no entertainment in their considerations. Wherefore, I say, joyn your thoughts onely to such designs, as shall be contrived by the Nobility with the State of Syria ; wherein the Myssians seem also to have a share, in regard the Lords govern all in their Countrey; and by that means you will best please my desires. Although Cassianus could not disprove the Princess Rhetorick, for that it taught him a duty belonging to his quality, which he had not hitherto altogether followed, since he more looked upon his own private concernments, in complying with his Uncles enemies, then those rights that belonged to the dignity and honour of Princes, of which number himself was eminent by blood and alliance: yet in regard of those hopes that Cloria gave him by her fair language, and good entertainment, he was sufficiently pleased with her discourse, for that it spake at leastwise liking, if not love to his ears; however, it seemed mixt with some reserved conditions, which he was content onely to interpret bashful assurances, though the Gods were privy to other intentions, that could not be altered: wherefore as if joyfully assured by the Princesses words, and impatient of more delay to put in execution what he was enjoyned, after he had returned humble thanks, not onely for her free expressions, but the confidence she had in his services, with some other complements belonging to his love, and fit for the season, kissing her fair hands he took his leave, vowing the absolute performance of all her commands to the uttermost of his power: But being gone, the Princess used these words to Roxana , fearing belike her own dissimulation was too great a crime. Do you believe, said she, that the Gods will be content with my hypocrisie, in making this poor Princes affections, a stale to our other purposes, since you know my vertuous engagements are so far from suffering me to become his wife, that my heart dares scarce think of such a perswasion in any kinde; and as little should I be willing such a report should reach the ears of absent Narcissus , who perhaps will accuse my constancy for having onely deceived, in that nature for his better advantage: No, no, Roxana , be confident, as plain dealing is best in all moral actions, so certainly in love the contrary procures either hate, jealousie, or despair, which may produce effects dangerous, if not destructive. After the old woman with a kinde of smile had heard out her Mistrisses discourse, she returned her this answer. As I cannot deny, said she, but dissimulation in it self, is a flattering vice, that steals upon many dispositions with certain possible if not probable signs of lawfulness, because they are contented to be perswaded by their imaginations, they mean no hurt in their intentions, which notwithstanding I must confess, destroyes all moral conversation; yet in all respects of the contrary, for a person to uncover his breast upon every occasion, without leaving himself a defence against his crafty enemy, were a madness capable to ruine his fortunes, as often as the opportunity presented the means. Wherefore, Madam in the general I can onely give this rule; when a body is left at liberty whether he will speak or no, let him rather hold his peace, then so much as intimate a falshood by his words, or in friendly conversation appear not candid and satisfactory: But if in deep examinations, that may produce great consequences either of good or hurt, for my part I am of opinion, all art possible may be used to avoid the determination, provided a direct untruth be not admitted; or the dammage of a third party sustained by the concealment. But Roxana , said the Princess, for that you intend this discourse for my satisfaction, I pray let us apply it to my case with my Cousin, whom you see I have won into a belief of what I never intend. 'Tis true, said Roxana , however it doth not appear you have engaged your self either by words or actions; and therefore it is not any thing you have done hath constrained or perswaded his belief; wherefore it ought onely to rest upon the fault of his own fancy, if he prove deceived in his expectation hereafter. Besides, it may be considered, that as he hath been some part of the occasion of your suffering unjustly, so is it fit he should endure a little penance for that offence; and put case it may be granted, that you have after a manner deluded his thoughts by the letter you wrote him, wherein you seem to invite his Addresses to a new Courtship, yet it cannot be esteemed false, for that you may have a resolution to entertain his affection, if my Lord Narcissus (whom the Gods defend) should miscarry. I but there Governess, replyed Cloria , lyes hidden the deceit, since my resolutions are fixed never to make any other choice in life or death: Why then, answered Roxana , at the worst you do but like an honest person in danger to be robbed, that takes some liberty to make Thieves fall out, whereby to be the better secured: And seeing that Cassianus cannot be prejudiced by the practice, but on the contrary reap benefit, for that his fortunes seem to depend upon regality and nobility, which the rude multitude would destroy; I see no reason why you should possess your thoughts with such scruples. Well well, said the Princess, as you are my Governess, in this doubt I will perswade my conscience to observe your principles; however, the Gods may punish us both for our over- much boldness, thus to play too freely with those injunctions that concern Religion, or at leastwise may have some relation to it; yet I cannot deny, but that there is a necessity in my dissimulation at this present; and the rather am I content a little to practise the faculty, for that I know Cassianus can sustain no prejudice by my intentions. Notwithstanding these and other reasons which Roxana used at divers times, proved sufficient motives to retain her Mistriss firm in prosecuting their designs; yet understanding by Creses amongst other discourses, that the Duke of Cyprus was dead, she could not in some sort but be doubtful of the safety of Narcissus , for that they had heard nothing from him since his separation; however she was extreamly careful to keep these thoughts, from entring into the bosom of the already too much troubled Princess, though in the interim she omitted no opportunity, whereby to instruct Cassianus in that part he was to play by their appointment against Farezius. But Cassianus , as I said, having received both commands from Cloria , and instructions by Roxana , consulted oftentimes with himself as well as with them how he might best put them in execution, until at last he fell upon this resolution; that as Dimogoras his trusty friend, had been most injur'd by the preferment of Farezius , having outed him of his place and command in the Army, so would he be the fittest person to be communicated withal, concerning the likeliest way to prosecute his designs, according to the directions he had received. To this effect he intended to make him acquainted, with the hopes he had lately received to obtain the favour of the Princess Cloria in his pretended love; the rather for that he knew he was not onely a man, who had a Principal interest among the Nobility and chief Senators, but was also extreamly beloved in the Army, by most of the common Souldiers, that were not absolute creatures of Farezius: Wherefore one morning before Dimogoras was gone out of his Chamber, Cassianus came unto him with a smiling countenance, and this language in his mouth. Dimogoras , said he, as it were something impertinent again for me, to reiterate the multitude of my obligations to your endeavours, since they are not onely generally known to all the world, but divers times have been acknowledged by my expressions in particular; so my business at present is to make you acquainted anew, both with my thoughts and intentions, concerning some late passages: I came into Lydia as you know by your procurement, to prosecute my affections to the fair Princess the Kings Daughter, when she was taken prisoner by the Senates Fleet in Pergame. 'Tis true my courtships in that nature were something retarded, if not absolutely laid aside until the present, by reason of a certain correspondency between her, and Narcissus the Duke of Cyprus Son. This gives me occasion to tell you, that however I found her then backward to my wishes; either proceeding from her flattering fancy that Narcissus was living, or conceiving her own condition was much more secure in the Senates custody, then at present under the jurisdiction of the Army and Souldiers; or rather I may say, being violently prest to some inconveniences, by reason of the extraordinary greatness, (both in command and authority) of Farezius , who as it should seem pretends something violently to her love and affection; yes now she is become more tractable, and willing to entertain those protestations of mine, whose effects I have ever consecrated to her service, since I had the honour to be entertained by the good will of the Lydian people: I need not trouble you much with the repetitions of your own received injuries, by reason of the Generals greatness, notwithstanding all those gallant services which you have performed, in the defence and safety of the Commonwealth; neither shall I mention the consequences thereby, that threaten a kind of destruction, to all the Nobility of the Kingdom, for that I know your judgement, and their apprehensions, cannot possibly be wanting in this particular: Onely I must needs tell you that the Princesse Cloria her self, extreamly wonders how it is possible, you should dispence so much with your honour and reputation, as to bear those indignities that have cast you from your authority and command, with such an extream quiet pacification? Are the Nobility (said she) of Lydia , so much degenerated in their souls and spirits, as easily in this manner to quit their honour, to the lowest conditions the people shall direct? what is become of the magnanimity of minde, once so frequently reigning in the breasts of the better sort of men in this Kingdome, that is now lost in a choas of confusion, with the rabble or common multitude? doth a little sensual fear, bury all considerations of valour and gallantry in this Nation? people being onely given to eat and drink, without affectation of greatness or apprehension of disgrace: If this be so my Lord in the general, my words will be as much in vain to be uttered, as your life in effect will be miserable in the future: But I have more confidence in the courage of Dimogoras , both for his own sake and my good. This being said, Cassianus rested silent, to hear what reply Dimogoras would make, Dimogoras, I may say, continued altogether mute for something a long space; his eyes sparkling out in the interim nevertheless, a certain kinde of seeming desire of revenge, though his body overgrown with flesh and humour, appeared not to be much inclinable to action: But being wakened to some determinate answer, by the importunities of Cassianus (who belike himself had been strongly urged by Roxana , to be speedy in the execution of her design) at last he blutter'd out this reply. My Lord, said he, I must confess, that both my self and the rest of the Nobility of Lydia according to the Princesses apprehension, (whose Father however I love not, nor ever shall) have wound their Dignities and Honours, into such a labyrinth of inconvenience, by complying so much with the violent, and confused humours of the common people, that we have in a manner suffered Farezius with the rest of his faction, to overthrow already the most essential part of our hereditary honours and priviledges; and by that means are become less powerful to act any thing with advantage either to our selves or others; nevertheless perhaps I may yet set on foot something of faction amongst the Souldiers, (if they have not wholly lost the remembrance, that I once commanded amongst them) that may perchance produce effects, tending to those purposes you have designed. With these words he entered into some rage and passion, as it were out of the very apprehension of his own loss of reputation, in being so disgracefully turned out of his command, and presently after this he took his leave of Cassianus, as pretending he would go to the Senate, to try his friends constitutions concerning those designs he intended. Cassianus was glad he had got thus much from his resolutions (for notwithstanding he did not at all doubt his affection, yet he might have some cause to suspect his activity) so that he determined himself also, to use the best interest he had, both with those Lords and the rest of the Senators, whom he knew to be of a contrary faction to Farezius ; and withal had upon all occasions free admittance into the Princesses lodgings, according to her own allowance and Roxana's directions; which as it may be thought sufficiently contented his apprehension. It was not long before Dimogoras and the rest of the Nobility, raised considerable factions and mutinies in the Army amongst the Souldiers, being enflamed by their want of pay, and not performance of other conditions promised them, upon their first taking up arms against the King, since renewed again to their hopes, when he was delivered out of prison, by some Troops sent to that purpose, which suddenly called away both Farezius and Hercrombrotus to the appeasing of the stirs. Though Farezius did with fair language, and promising words in a short speech, seemingly pacifie most of their discontents, yet Hercrombrotus , who was of a more violent and active nature, finding many of the Troops continue still their mutinies and insolencies against their command, suddenly flew in amongst those Souldiers with fury in his looks, and terrour in his countenance, where presently seizing upon two or three of those that appeared most refractory and disobedient, he delivered them instantly over to Officers to be executed and punished: After this, he not onely offered a free pardon to the rest, but also promised them a real performance of all their just expectations, provided that from thence forward, they would continue obedient and constant in their affections. When both Farezius and Hercrombrotus were on their way again towards the City of Sardis , an Officer of the Army began this discourse to his General: Sir, said he, by this late mutiny you may see the danger not onely of Dimogoras interest amongst the Souldiers, but the power he hath with those of the better sort of Senators; from which original I suppose, hath proceeded in part these now appeased troubles in the Camp. Of the other side, can you possibly conceive, that after so many testimonies of disaffection from Euarchus the King, he will be ever brought, to be either entire for the Souldiers advantage, or be weaned from that affection without reason, he hath alwayes expressed to be in his nature, for his false and ungrateful Countreymen the Myssians? in like manner, with what confidence can we any more trust the actions of the wealthy City of Sardis , when as they did not onely refuse to open their purses to our occasions in our greatest necessities, but denyed us entrance into their Town, by the perswasion of those Senators that we have now sent to banishment. These things being granted to be true, the next consideration ought to be had of the remedy for future prevention: In the first place to compass our designs, and procure our security, we must endeavour to joyn with a prevailing party in the Senate, or at leastwise make them so by the Souldiers power, who may pass an absolute decree, to have no more Treaties with the King, in regard that those hopes and fears, do not a little distract the whole Kingdom, from relying absolutely upon our commands and jurisdiction, as you know most necessary for the peoples safety: In the next place we are totally to suppress the interest of Dimogoras for the present, and the Nobilities priviledges in the future, which as I must tell you, keep up such an opinion amongst all sorts of people, concerning their greatness and stability, that it will be a very difficult matter, to act any thing either for the Kingdoms good or the Armies advantage: Lastly, we must not onely drive the Myssian Commissioners out of our Countrey, who onely wait occasions to suck up all the benefit to themselves, which the Lydians at any time shall either fight or toyl for, but in some terrifying way or other procure money from the Citizens of Sardis , whereby to give just and fitting content to those faithful and loving Souldiers, that have fought so many bloody Battles, and obtained multitudes of signal Victories in their Countreys behalf, against their numerous enemies. Though Farezius by reason of his melancholy and silent nature, made no great reply at the present, to those reasons that had been delivered; yet it was not many dayes after their arrival at Sardis, before an absolute decree passed the Senate, that not onely there should be no more Treaties or Addresses made unto Euarchus , concerning any agreement either in the general or particular, but it was also ordered, that it should be esteemed a crime of a most high consequence, for any person so much as to make tender of any proposition to that effect, to the rest of the Senators there assembled: which resolution was quickly published over the whole Kingdom of Lydia by a formal Proclamation. Of the other side Dimogoras finding, both his interest in the Army, and his credit with the Senators, did not any way suit with his ambition and expectation, upon the very apprehension (as 'twas thought) of these apparent disgraces, in a very few dayes ended his life in this world; however there were some that not onely gave it out, but believed, that he had been poisoned, to prevent a farther trouble and danger to the Kingdom. This also gave occasion to Prince Cassianus , within a very short time after, to quit personally the Countrey of Lydia ; as perhaps supposing, now his chief friend and favourite Dimogoras was gone, and the rest of the Lords not being in a capacity to support his honour and designs, against the Souldiers, in the Princess Cloria's behalf, it was to little purpose any longer to prosecute his pretended love. Nevertheless the Nobility, with many other of the Senators of the same faction, prepared themselves to give the body of Dimogoras , most stately and glorious Funerals: To this intent when the day came, all attired in black, they met the Corpse with a world of Ceremony, and so conducted it through a multitude of people, to the place ordained for that purpose, where being placed according to the custom of other Generals, the flames quickly consumed the pyles, whilst that which was immortal had a farther account to give, concerning his actions and thoughts during his life. When the Princess Cloria understood of this strange and unexpected law, not onely pronounced in the Senate, but published all over the Kingdom, she began now to repent her of her too much belief given to the Kings enemies, notwithstanding any perswasion whatsoever she had entertained in her thoughts; and consequently had more cause a great deal to doubt her own security, then hope of her Fathers releasement, having no other defence left her, but what she could gather from the faithful and wise counsels of her intrusted Governess Roxana , which was the occasion, that one day having for the most part spent her whole store of passion, she used this kinde of despairing discourse unto her. Truly Roxana , said she, as there might be noted at first, a strong jealousie amongst the Souldiers, by the strict guard set upon the Kings Person, so this last action makes me fear, that there is some prevailing design, as well against our Liberties as his Dominion, which we shall be scarce able to prevent by any industry or assistance; for as I cannot rely much upon the Lords Power; by reason they have altogether lost their Authority, by severing their Interests at the first from their Princes Prerogative, nothing but to comply with their own ambition and spleen; so is there as little to be hoped for, from the endeavours of this great and rich City of Sardis , considering their late carriages, when Farezius with his triumphant Army, not onely entered their Walls without resistance, but were content to receive his absolute commands, without the least dispute, belonging to their long enjoyed priviledges, never as yet questioned by any former Prince or Power. These representations being known and granted to be the effects of the late transactions, what probabilities remain, for the recovery of my Fathers Rights, though it should be opinionated, that we our selves were out of all danger personally? since the Kings Party appears, not to have either ability or will to do him good; and Lydia being strongly united under the present jurisdiction, what forreign industry and endeavour soever, can work any considerable effects to his advantage? considering the many brave Vessels and Shipping, that are alwayes ready for defence and resistance, upon the Carian and Ionian shores, to oppose either sudden invasion or continued hostility. When Roxana had for some time rested silent with tears in her eyes, she returned her this answer: Lady, said she, you must then give me leave to blame your superstitious modesty (as I may call it) in not suffering your Uncle Orsames , to have performed those ceremonies belonging to your Nuptials at Memphis ; which perhaps in part, if not totally, would have prevented these inconveniencies. Indeed Governess, replyed the Princess, although perhaps you esteem those decorums of fitting duty, which I shall be ever ready to render my Father and Mother, but bashful superstitions, yet I can assure you, I shall never be so much wanting to my own honour, as rather not a thousand times to venture my dearest life, then to give away my self to any love whatsoever, without their inward consent and publick approbation: but let us for the present leave that subject, and onely fall upon the consideration, or the means, whereby the King may be redeemed from his miseries, which Rhetorick will not onely far better please my ears, but be a much more profitable discourse in my opinion, since in the other point, I am resolved still to remain obstinate, notwithstanding any perswasion to the contrary. Truly, said Roxana, as I must needs confess, the thing it self is something difficult to bring about, and the wayes more uncertain to know how; so of the other side, I am so far from believing the impossibility of the Kings restoration to his ancient dignity, that according to my own thoughts I shall give you very probable reasons, whereby to perswade you to it, if my fancy doth not much outgoe my judgement. For although I cannot deny, but that the Countrey of Lydia , being throughly united under a well settled Government, with the addition of Ionia and Caria , that afford so many considerable Havens, furnished with multitude of Shipping, is a condition scarce to be attempted by any power; yet considering the impatience of the peoples natures, with the daily oppressions of them by the heavy weight of Taxations, a quick division will be wrought in the hearts of those, that must of necessity be won to the change of Laws, and Government, before the ancient constitutions (by which the Subjects have formerly lived happily for so many ages) can be totally taken away; however for the present, perhaps either fear or hope, exercises so far mens thoughts, that hardly as yet have they leasure for consideration: But when as I say, they shall finde this is like to be perpetual, they will with much violence desire again their old subjection, though at first they were foolishly perswaded to seek a new Government. And more especially if those two great Monarchs of Syria and Egypt , once make that accord that all Asia attends with a greedy expectation, which may soon be effected, since the King of Armenia hath already agreed with his discontented Princes, and also hath condiscended to give satisfaction to the Scythian Crown, whereby to deliver his Countrey absolutely from that power, that hath so many years molested it with its Arms. But Roxana , said the Princess, what will those agreements conduce to my Fathers benefit, when every Prince regards onely his own concernments? besides their extream jealousie of one anothers glory, will not suffer them to undertake any conquest joyntly: And put case they should accord constantly in their purposes, yet when the people of Lydia shall see themselves ready to be invaded by a forreign power, they will certainly more strongly conform their obediences, to this jurisdiction they now live under, whereby the better to prevent a new threatning danger. It is true, said Roxana , until the Subjects be made more desperate in their sufferings, the people will not be content to trust strangers with their liberty; but yet the assistance that is desired from forreign Princes, needs not to consist wholly in numerous Armies, but in small and frequent supplies, both of men and moneyes, which joyned with the Kings Party, and laying hold of the many discontents already ingendered in the hearts of most, cannot but conduce exceedingly to the overthrow of this new Government. Besides there is another benefit that may be expected from other Countreys, being at open difference with the Senate of Lydia ; and that is, denying their Merchants the liberty of Trade within their Dominions, which at last must of necessity discontent and impoverish the rich City of Sardis , from whence the Souldiers are (if not maintained) at leastwise supplyed upon all urgent occasions. But why, answered Cloria , may not these Princes, and especially the two great Monarchs of Egypt and Syria , as well forbid the free commerce you speak of in the time of their own differences, as when they shall be at peace between themselves, if they have any intention to right my Father, as I have heard they do pretend? Because, replyed Roxana , they are both so full of their own ambition, that neither dares offend the State of Lydia as yet, until their Wars be at an end between themselves, lest they might give too much advantage to each other by the assistance of so powerful a Kingdome as this is. Then said the Princess, there may be some hopes to better my Fathers affairs, when these Kings shall think it good, to put up their bloody Swords, and not before. I conclude not so Madam, answered Roxana , for although these exasperated Princes against their own quiet, should have neither temper in their actions, nor finde wisdom in their councellours, until meer necessity should constrain their Subjects to seek peace with violence, which were too dangerous a president; yet it is to be hoped, that the Myssians with the Cretan Forces, joyned to the discontents of Lydia , by reason of diversity of Religions and Interests, would in time restore the King to his ancient dignity. Pish Roxana , replyed Cloria , for the Myssians , I have so little confidence in their assistance, that what countenance soever their actions put on, I can scarce be perswaded of their intentions, since they once sold my Father to this misery he now undergoes, when they had a gallant Army in the Field to have redeemed both his Person and his Crown: And for the Cretans , besides that they are of a different profession to ours concerning the worship of the Gods; there are also so many factions amongst them by way of private ambition, that they rather go back daily in their own affairs, then shew any probability of helping others; and for the discontents of Lydia which you mention, with their diversities, of Religions, I do not finde upon all occasions, but they can very well lay down their own spleens, when there appears a necessity to oppose my fathers prosperity: Lastly, concerning the common peoples sufferings, I am perswaded, they are resolved to endure any subjection, or almost bondage it self, rather then to be willing the King should recover again his lost Rights, by force and power of the sword, without making first some conditions with his Prerogative, notwithstanding he hath divers times, given them by protestations, what assurances could be desired from a just and a religious Prince. Madam, answered Roxana , your opinion I must confess is grounded upon a great deal of probability, considering how the Missians not onely sold the King to the power of the Senate, but at the first beginning of these troubles came into Lydia to dispute your Fathers Rights: But yet if you please to consider, that the reason of their actions then proceeded from the extream covetousness of some eminent persons amongst them, who finde now they can expect no more gain, (the Senate having already compassed their ends upon them) you will easily believe, that they are resolved to change the Scene for your Fathers advantage, since by that means they may come to play a double game, and win by the bargain: Next concerning the Cretans , although I must confess their foolish divisions amongst themselves, have not onely much hindred the Kings Affairs, and in a manner indangered the whole frame of their own designs, yet is there such a disparity between them, and the people of Lydia , not onely in regard of the difference of Religion, but in that we have outed them formerly of much of their Lands, that they will dye to the last man, rather then suffer the Senate to bear rule over them: Thirdly, I must desire you not to dwell too strictly upon your belief, that the common people of Lydia will so easily accord their difference, and pacifie their discontents, upon the appearance of a strange Army; in regard it will onely bring with it the right of the cause, with a promise of amendment; especially when they shall by a little more experience finde, that their present grievances have neither termination nor limitation: For I say, that as at the first they were perswaded to entertain the assistance of the Myssians , whom they most hated, and feared of all other Nations, against their King, who oppressed them in nothing, however their fancies did injure their judgements, so will they as well accept of any forreign assistance against the Senate, when they can no longer endure the burthen of their oppressions: And last of all give me leave to tell you, that the divisions within the Army and Senate House, cannot but produce strange effects, since no spleen is so great, as what is ingendred by the same faction, when once they fall at odds, either by reason of gain or prerogative: But as she was further proceeding in her discourse, the Dwarf informed them, that there was newly arrived in the Castle Hall a young Maid of an excellent beauty, who desired with much earnestness, to be brought presently into the Princesse presence, as pretending she had some secret to discover, not convenient to be imparted to any other ear; he also said, that as her eyes sparkled forth a kinde of youthful Majesty, so did her neglectful dress seem to have been disordered by her late journey, which made her appear more Amazon like. This strange advertisement put them both into a sollicitous consideration, as well concerning the person of the party, as the occasion of the adventure; and many loving desires would gladly have perswaded poor Cloria, that Narcissus had borrowed another disguize, to have given her a new visit: But having more exactly examined her little servant, concerning all particulars, she found the stranger neither in stature or countenance, could agree with the proportion or features of her absent Lord: Wherefore after some more displeasing consideration, with a kinde of a sad voice, as if her thoughts were troubled at the mistake, she commanded the Page to conduct the Maid to her presence. As soon as the Damosel entred the room, with confidence enough, approaching nearer to the Princess, in an abrupt manner told her, though softly in her ear, that her new guest was no other but her Brother Ascanius , broke from his imprisonment under the Senates jurisdiction; wherefore wisht her for some time to discharge her Dwarf, that he might more freely discourse to her his adventures. Cloria was so much confounded with a sudden joy, to have her sweet Brother in her possession, whom she could not be permitted to see during their imprisonment; that her distractions could scarce finde a way, to put in execution, what her own judgement should have thought convenient at another season: But at last breaking through her pleasant amazement, she discharged her little officer; for however she was accustomed to trust him in her own secrets, yet she would not notwithstanding, use any priviledge to hazzared her Brothers confidence, lest it might render him less assured of his safety: When she had passionately demonstrated his welcome, by many affectionate kisses, taking his white hand in hers, which seemed also to have a near alliance in beauty, she desired him to make her acquainted with the passages of his escape, since as she said, they could not but be admirable, considering the strict guard the Senate was ever accustomed to set over the Kings Children; in the interim Roxana curiously attended, to understand the discourse that was to proceed from such dainty Lips. Wherefore, after Ascanius had saluted his Sisters looks, with three or four gentle smiles, in which he seemed lovely to congratulate his own fortune, and deride his Gaolers carelessness, he began this repetition, though first he excused himself, for many circumstances belonging to the story. My Father, said he, as he had commanded my Brother Prince Arethusius for his better safety, into the Kingdom of Syria , there to attend the directions of our noble Mother, so was he perswaded by the Myssians (in whose power he then remained in the Army) to get me into his own possession, whereby the better to secure (as they pretended) as many as might be of the Blood Royal: To this purpose he commanded me to make an escape, and presently to repair to his presence; however with this caution, that if I should be prevented in the execution, I must not by any means reveal his desire, lest the Myssians should be brought into suspicion, who were then treating with the Senate about their payment. But be their pretences what they would, I strengthened my duty and obedience, by all the thoughts my yong years and less discretion could suggest, advantageable to the design and the Kings command, which I must tell you scarce gave sleep to my eyes in the night, or rest to my body in the day, since truly I must needs say, my youthfull ambition became more violent then ordinary, to do something exactly that might pretend to care and wisdom. Yet not to trouble you with long repetitions, where the success proved unfortunate, I was to my intollerable grief taken in my escape, though more perplexed I must confess, to be foyled in my first enterprize, then sorrowful at the consequence of the loss; being apprehended, I was by order of the Senate, exactly examined before such Commissioners, as their gravities ordained to be Judges of my actions; however the Gods so far favoured my weak constancy, that neither tyranny nor flattery, was able to shake my dutiful resolution, which so inraged their froward spleens, that they not onely caused me to be shut up in a dark room, but commanded some slight punishment to be inflicted upon my person, as a small combatant in my fathers quarrel, at which I rather laughed than seemed to feel: But not finding these petty sufferings could prevail against my spirit, they ordered a great part of my dyer to be taken from me, as supposing belike my belly was easiest to be conquered, when truly I never esteemed meat the chief part of my consideration; especially when I was assured for their own sakes, they would afford me sufficient to sustain nature; yet at last having tryed all other wayes to compass their ends, without receiving any fruit from their labours, they withdrew from me those accustomed respects belonging to my birth and quality, which I cannot deny, but most wrought upon my disposition, for that I conceived the dignity of my parents, as also your self sweet Sister suffered in the omission. To be short, finding themselves wholly overcome by the goodness of my cause, rather then by my courage, they began of a sudden to change (though not the Theatre) yet the manner of their action; which was not onely to sweeten their carriages towards me, but also to tickle up my young ambition, with hopes of being their elected King. For as they said, my Father having totally abused his Trust, and my eldest Brother Arethusius being unkindely fled from their protection, they could finde none other so fit a person, to undertake the Government of the whole Kingdom as my self, if I would but express love in my nature, and be ruled by their Counsels; for their intentions as they protested, were never to destroy Monarchy: But I being enflamed with a new rage, to hear them to scandalize my Fathers goodness, and go about to withdraw my duty by their intentions, I answered, That as my Father had been much too gentle a Prince for such people; so was their dissimulation no more to be believed concerning my self in these offers, then when they protested to the world, to make Euarchus the greatest King of Asia ; and in the mean time had to the uttermost of their power, deprived him of his Crown and Dignity. This blunt and resolute reply of mine, belike gave them no further encouragement to proceed; for telling me, I was a peevish childe, and could not be brought to understand my own good, they not onely quitted my company, but by degrees suffered again the stream to return into its right course, to my singular content; which however continued me still a Prisoner. Having past over so great a storm without shipwrack either of my own honour, or danger to my Fathers Affairs, I began to conceive good opinions of my judgement; and beginning likewise to be extream weary of my captivity, since my years now required activity, I fell into many considerations of another escape; and had encouragement to put it in execution, not onely by daily rumours I heard of the discontents of the people, for that they found no inclination of the Senate to agree with the King; but also, for that I understood many of the Kings ships had lately revolted from their service: All which I say enflamed my thoughts to a new design, and these inflamations of hope, desire, and passion, made me diligent to procure the good opinion of those, that were intrusted with my person, as a necessary consequence to my intention. I oftentimes demanded of them to what end was it to use rigour in my imprisonment, when it might turn to their prejudice, if our side should hereafter prevail; neither could it at all benefit them for the present with their masters by any rewards, if they continued still in authority? These perswasions with other circumstances, took them off from the fierceness of their speed, especially when they had heard that Farezius was forced to send many of his Troops abroad, to reduce some Provinces again to his obedience, that rather chose to run into desperate dangers, then still to continue under the Senates power. These encouragements, I say, made me begin to frame those Embryous I had already conceived in my unsettled brain to some shape, proper for production; and to this purpose, descending from generals to particulars, I acquainted a servant I have now brought along with me, (whom I alwayes found faithful to my intentions) that my resolution was, in this distracted season to gain my liberty out of the Castle; and therefore wisht him to provide for my escape such necessaries as were convenient for a business of so great consequence, that concerned not onely my own safety, but my Fathers prosperity, but in the interim to colour my design, I gave it out that I intended to solemnize the birth-day of my Brother, by a publick Mask, to be acted for the delight of those Souldiers of my guard: When the night came, (having all the afternoon before filled their brains with the fumes of excellent Wine, as their imagination with the expectation of the story of Jupiter , flying from the ill natured rage of his cruel Father) after they were all orderly placed in their seats, I caused the scene to be discovered, which appeared to their view of so taking a quality, that they had no leasure at all to attend their charge, so that I had liberty sufficient by their willing or careless neglect, to pass divers times without my accustomed attendants, through the Galleries into my private Bed-chamber, as pretending I had some necessary office in the play: but at last finding they were all either sufficiently secured in their employment of curiosity, or past consideration by reason of their over liberal diet, I more secretly retired into my Cabinet, where I had appointed my servant to attend with womans apparel; which Robes being soon fitted to my person, they so well suited with my imagination, that I carried my self with much confidence amongst the multitudes of company in every room: When I came into the common hall, my servant ushered me as some Masquer to the door; where the Porter made no difficulty to give us passage, as believing it was a necessary duty belonging to his office, not to be at all jealous in such joviality, lest his fellows might have derided him for his ridiculous caution. But however, I got thus prosperously from the danger of all the Courts of guard, yet the last Centinel, either bitten with his servil attendance in the open air, whilst his other companions in warm rooms enjoyed content, or being by nature more suspitious then the rest of his fellows, began strictly, not onely to examine our intentions, but roughly to deny our passage, insomuch as my servant, not believing it was safe to admit of such a hazardable contention, quickly drew out a short hanger he had by his side, and gave him a blow upon the pate, that made him ask counsel of the ground for the rest of his proceedings; whether the wound was mortal or no, we left him onely to consider, whilst we made our passage, free in the night season, through a thick wood not far distant from the Castle, until the breaking of the morning, constrained us to seek refuge in a dark cave, where we continued all the next day for fear of discovery; since we doubted not, but my flight would soon be pursued with open cry. When the sky began again to be obscured for our advantage, after the going down of the Sun, we thought it best to take a new journey towards the City of Sardis , where confusion we supposed would secure us, until we could finde a convenient transportation for Syria , however our weariness, and want of food, compelled me the next day about noon, to take up my habitation in a small Cottage under a hill side, in whose dwelling there onely remained an old man with his wife, having between them as the fruits of their long marriage one daughter, which by the way must occasion a pretty short story: We no sooner entred the house, but being provoked by a sufficient appetite, we called for such provision as they had, promising a large payment, and they as willingly condescended to our desires; in which office the Maid seemed most diligent, not onely in regard of her own good huswifery, but being exceedingly delighted, as might be gathered by her smiling countenance at my strange attire; in the house there was but two beds, the one where the old people lay, and the other for the young wench; so that I was to take up my rest necessarily in the Girls bed, where I must confess, I slept to my content, whilst my attendant made use of a bundle of straw in an out house for his lodging; but in the morning I might feel, not onely one in bed with me, but the party to have her hand over my breast, whom by more consideration I found to be the young Damsel of the Cottage; this I must confess put me to some confusion, until by a strict examination of her intention, I perceived it was onely her own innocent curiosity, because she thought me a fine young Gentlewoman: At which relation the Princess could not chuse but laugh; the rather for that Ascanius did with something a constrained earnestness, strive to defend the wenches chastity, as if he had been jealous also of his own honour, yet nevertheless he was forced to confess, the Maid did much question him, because he had no greater breasts; but having sufficiently cleared his reputation, and jested out the rest, he again continued his discourse. Although, said he, I had sufficiently satisfied her in all questions concerning my travels, yet I had much ado to perswade her to rise from me; so much was she in love with my company, neither would she condiscend to my request until she had again imbraced me, bestowing three or four of her kisses upon my lips: This being performed, and having yawned a pretty space, as a testimony of her youthful laziness, she suddenly started out of the bed in her Smock, that was not of the finest cloth, where she remained still discoursing with me, until her Father and Mother lying in the lower room, gave her a call or two to hasten her speed; yet I had opportunity enough to enquire of her, not onely the nearest way to Sardis , but of the conveniency of the next Town, where I meant to provide my self of some change of apparel, since I durst not trust those, which brought me from the Castle. In conclusion, after I had imployed my servant a few dayes near the place to buy other Robes; and bestowed my old apparel upon the wench, for a gratuity of her kindness, in affording me so freely her company the first night, I not permitting the second, I took my leave lovingly of the old people, who truly had entertained me with an honest Countrey affection; so that presently according to our direction we repaired to the Banks of the River Pactolus , where we quickly hired a Bark, that without any suspicion at all brought us to Sardis , which Town sheltered us without discovery, until we found another conveniency, to convey us to your Castle; where being arrived, we are confident you will not betray your guests, but rather advise us by your counsel, how to prosecute further our affairs; since it is to be thought, they will make a sudden and diligent inquiry after my escape. At which words with a pretty smile, the Princess Cloria cast her eyes upon her Governess, as if she expected from her experience the best direction for them both. Roxana , when she had drawn the looks of Ascanius upon her in a curious manner, since he had not been formerly acquainted with her conversation, and also mused according to her custome for some short space, she gave this advice. Truly, said she, as it is most necessary in the prime place, that my Lord Ascanius provide for his own security, since it is impossible but some speedy search will be after his escape, the Senate not being willing to part with so many of the Royal Family out of their own jurisdiction; so Madam, be peased to think it convenient, that the Queen now remaining in Syria , may presently be made acquainted with this fortunate delivery, of my Lord your Brother from his imprisonment, by some trusty messenger to be dispatched from our Counsels; which party may be (as I conceive) this faithful servant, the companion of his Travels, whom he hath now brought along with him into this Castle, who cannot well remain here, in that he will rather prove a subject of suspicion, then an officer of use, since the daily visits of this place by the Nobility, and other people of quality, must of necessity bring his name in question: And for this beautiful runaway your Brother, since he so well becomes a maids attire, and hath so bravely given testimony of his own modesty, I see no reason why he may not still live amongst us, without danger to his own person, or prejudice to our honours, being entertained as your attendant in your Chamber, until either commands out of Syria call him away, or you your self be removed from the jurisdiction of this Kingdom, by your happy marriage with my Lord Narcissus ; at which words the Princess became as red as Scarlet, not dreaming her young Brother should so abruptly, have been made acquainted with her secret ingagement: But the fault was already committed, and Roxana had no time to ask forgiveness, wherefore something confounded by her errour, as well as she could she went on with her continued discourse. However, said she, that we may not remain altogether ignorant of the proceedings of the Senate, I shall industriously endeavour to instruct our little Dwarf, who wants no wit to make such inquiry abroad, as may be most convenient for our affairs; for whose truth and honesty I will undertake, with the engagement of my reputation: This may give you a full liberty, to enjoy with freedom each others company, a benefit that neither of you will repine at I am sure, since the fates have been hitherto penurious to both your conversations: With these words she rested silent, in a kinde of a grave smile, expecting the young couple should sign their consents by some demonstration. After that Roxana had fully ended her discourse, the lovely pair looked upon each other, with such a sweet chearfulness, as if their own passions had no desire to enquire further after the depth of her reasons, since their hearts abundantly approved of the consequence of her design; which was, that they might enjoy the felicity of one anothers conversation: At last Cloria asked her Brother, how he liked the wisdom of her Governess, which gave him occasion to tell her, that he did not now wonder, how she had passed through the intricacy of so many dangerous adventures, having had so faithful and discreet a Pilot to guide her, in the vaste sea of such desperate accidents. In the mean time this delighted company past away their hours in such conversation, as most tended to Euarchus wished prosperity; sometimes complaining of the unrelenting cruelty of the Senate, that could so long detain their just and merciful King in a dark prison, instead of casting themselves at his feet, humbly to desire pardon for their offences; otherwhiles again they would entertain their thoughts, with new hopes of his releasement, by powerful Armies sent into Lydia by all the Princes of Asia , in which number Narcissus had no low rank in the opinion of love-partial Cloria ; neither seldom did they agree in belief, that the general distractions of the Kingdom, would soon put an end to the differences without any other assistance, until these diversities of fancies carried them one day into the Garden, where Cloria's dilgent servant in the view of other attendants, observed so carefully the directions of her charge, that she made alwayes election of those fruit, that the Princess intention did but onely covet, and presented them to be made more beautifull by the touch of her white hand, In these entertainments I say they continued, until an ancient Lord of the Senate, who had not altogether put off his duty and affection to the Kings posterity, with a seeming joy that made him forget his accustomed ceremonies to the Princess Cloria, not onely suddenly entred the Garden, but made a kinde of rude passage, through the crowd of such as waited near her person; and with a breathless voice informed her, that that very morning, as the Nobility were sitting in their own Councel chamber, divided by a partition from the common assembly of the lower Senate, they were saluted in a tumultuous manner, by many thousands of people, (having their leaders of much greater quality) with a Petition, that not onely complained of the proceedings of the Army, but desired they might again speedily enjoy the liberty of their King, the freedom of the Laws, and an establishment of their Religion; as they said absolutely obstructed from their possession, by the licentious power of the Souldiers under Farezius command, whom (as they intimated) they had formerly chosen to be their Captain for some season, but not to be a Tyrant against their priviledges for ever; vowing with all, that as they would not depart the great City of Sardis without a direct answer, so were they resolved to procure an accomplishment of their just requests, to the hazzard of their lives and fortunes. O Madam, said he, how these brave beginnings, inflamed our souls with new courages; notwithstanding, we could not chuse in some sort, but reflect upon our own poorness of spirit; or at leastwise dulness in understanding, that never went about to put in execution what these people propound at present for their and our advantages. Truly, replied the Princess Cloria , although I cannot but commend these peoples understandings, that appear to have some sense and feeling of their reputations, yet must I a great deal more extol their courages, that dare expose themselves, to maintain those small priviledges which by a certain kinde of birth-right, they have received from their honest and wise Ancestors; when as you of the Nobility of the contrary, seem altogether stupid in the apprehension of such honourable Rights, that appertain to your qualities, left you by the brave endeavour of your most noble predecessors; being at the first so splenative indiscreet, in your passions against your Prince, (though without any known cause whatsoever) that you were content, to sacrifice your known own advantages, above the common people, onely that you might destroy him and his prerogative; not leaving your selves so much power, as to be able again to recover your own dignities. These words and reproof of the Princess almost put the Nobleman out of his tale; but she finding him something out of countenance, encouraged him to the prosecution of his relation. Madam, said he, when we had thanked them for their prudent admonition, (as we termed it) what our own duties should have remembred, we presently dismissed them, with other speeches and promises, that sufficiently contented them for the instant. After they were gone, I must tell you, we sent to the other part of the Senate, sitting in another room distinct from ours, intimating we desired some conference with them, whereby the people might be rendred satisfied in their just seeming demands: upon our meeting, many things were propounded to that purpose, as well concerning our selves, as the souldiers; but what will be the issue of these proceedings, for my part I am not able to divine? onely we are informed, that the multitude will not depart from the City of Sardis , until they have received such answer, as may in some sort give content to their thoughts: which either must settle the Kingdom in a probable posture for peace and quietness, or so enflame the Armies resolutions, that they will endeavour to become masters of the whole. With these words he abruptly took his leave, as if his apprehensions had been transported onely by imaginary conceits. As soon as the Lord had quitted the Garden, and the rest of the attendance being also removed some distance from them, the Princess, Ascanius , and Roxana began to fall upon considerations and discourses of the Kings Affairs: sometimes their hopes were carried to assure themselves, that it was unpossible, but these confusions must needs produce effects to that purpose; since, as they believed, the Souldiers of the Senate could not long agree, and then the common peoples desires of necessity would again bring him into his Throne; for they imagined, that however there might be obstacles and contentions for the present, in regard of the extraordinary power of the Army, yet the Souldiers at the last could not but admit of a King, more willingly then any other General of their own rank, to command over them: Besides they doubted not, but the Nobility and the City of Sardis , would joyn together to establish Euarchus , in the same honour and dignity, as he was in before these late troubles; since the consequences had already not a little impoverished the whole Kingdom, and what it would do further if it should continue; might very well be feared, though as yet not certainly known: In that the dignity of a Court probably would as well confirm the one in their hereditary priviledges, as enrich the others by Traffick and Commerce; seeing it was chiefly the better sort of persons, that took off the commodities of the Merchants. These pleasant apprehensions invited them all three to take some delight, in a certain beautiful and refreshing Grove, encompassed round about by an intricate Labyrinth, or Wilderness of flourishing Trees, that shaded it sufficiently from the eyes of people: In the midst thereof there was a Fountain, upon the borders of which was contrived many sorts of Chaces by Dogs and Huntsmen; who by the turning of several artificial Cocks, seemed not onely to move in prosecution of their prey, but the Hounds with open mouths barked and made a noise. The prettiness of the conceit, for a long space gave young Ascanius sufficient content: When they were weary of beholding of this invention, they went to the viewing of other rarities: There they might behold Andromeda , with the Sea Monster coming out of the water to devour her, whilst her sorrowful parents stood upon the bordering shore, to behold that woeful and lamentable Tragedy, occasioned as they thought, by the too much severity and cruelty of the Gods; until Perseus the son of Dane , that was Courted in a shower of Gold by Jupiter , descended from the skies upon his flying horse, and seemed to rescue the distressed Lady. There were also to be seen in that place, divers Artificers working in their Trades, onely by the force and current of the water: in like manner others playing upon several kindes of Instruments, both delightful to the ear, and pleasing to the apprehension. Besides, Birds of all species made of Glass and other materials, that seemed to chirp in a natural way, though onely so contrived by the meer invention of men, to give the greater satisfaction to luxurious sense. After they had as it were glutted their contemplation with these delightful vanities, the Princess Cloria being better skill'd then her brother in the use of such devices, suddenly turned one of the pipes, which quickly over-spread young Ascanius with a large Canopy of Water, that resembled a plentiful, though sweet shower from the heavens, insomuch as he knew not at the instant, how to winde himself out of the inconveniency, until he was forced to entreat his sisters favour for his redemption; neither did she altogether afford him that grace, since he became a little wet to purchase a convenient experience against another time. But Roxana , as if she thought her Mistress had used something too much severity towards her young Brother, began a needless apology for the action, when she might have known, Ascanius could not be displeased at any thing his sister did. When they had as it were dwelt long enough upon these watry pleasures, they again returned into their own lodgings, in which place the metamorphosed maid, was most careful to observe those decorums that belonged to her office and attendance, lest the contrary might have occasioned the endangering of his discovery: where they remained, I may say, entertaining themselves sometimes with hopes, and sometimes with fears, until the Dwarfs return brought them more certain intelligence, of many passages both from Sardis and other Regions: however because they desired to understand his information, in the most methodical way, in regard the circumstances as they apprehended, would give a great light to the intentions on foot, they wisht him to tell his story and adventures in order, which he performed in this manner. After, said he, I parted from this Castle, according to your command, I went to the very door of the Senate house, the best place as I thought for intelligence; where finding all those that stood without in a most confused distraction, both in their words and looks, it was not long before many of the chief Senators, of a sudden came out of the room; when presently they went with a great deal of haste towards another chamber, where I understood by the discourses of the multitude, they were designed to meet some of the Lords about a conference concerning the settlements of the disorders of the Kingdom. I being both bold, and little, and so consequently as I thought not much to be suspected, in the confused crowd thrust in along with them, where placing my self in a nook of the chamber under a hanging, it was my chance to hear these several discourses from them. The first sort of Senators that spake, thought it convenient, if not altogether necessary, again to settle the King in his ancient dignity, not onely in regard of the extraordinary cries of the common people to that purpose, but also for that there were so many several factions within themselves in the Senate, not probable to be reconciled, with any advantage to the Nation: Others notwithstanding were of a contrary opinion, alledging that it were better to hazzard the ruine of the whole Countrey in a general confusion, then to come any more under the jurisdiction of that Tyrannical Government, as they said they had with so much blood already endeavoured to destroy: A third number of that assembly, seemed in some sort to be willing, to restore again Euarchus to his Crown in full lustre; but they doubted lest his unrelenting spleen might put him on, to call the Senate to a strict account for their past actions, and severity used both against his authority and person, wherefore wisht rather to have some of his posterity Crowned in his place, whom for such a benefit as they believed, would easily be perswaded to forgive and forget his Fathers injuries: This proposition a long time entertained their fancies, until they considered, that not onely Prince Arethusius was in the Kingdom of Syria , prosecuting the Queen his Mothers designs, and my Lord Ascanius his brother had lately by flight procured his own liberty without their consents, which absolutely beat back any more discourse upon that subject; however they thought it convenient, if not extreamly necessary for the present, to give what satisfaction they could to the discontented people: who belike attended in great numbers, about the City of Sardis to that purpole: yet it was considered withal, that if they should endeavour altogether to please the multitude, without having their Swords ready drawn in their hands, whereby to be able to chastize them, if they should prove too unreasonable in their demands, they must expect dangerous and insolent affronts, instead of quietness and obedience to their commands: Insomuch as they thought it convenient in the interim whilst they entertained the peoples expectations, with good words and fair promises, to send privately to Farezius , wishing him to be ready to march with his Souldiers, to keep the multitude in due obedience to the Senates Authority, if they should continue these extravagant prosecutions of their designs; which in effect being fully resolved upon by them all, they quickly broke up the Assembly. So that when they were in this manner dispersed, and I had freed my self undiscovered from their companies, I thought it my duty, to gain what other intelligence I could amongst the common people, since I conceived, much consisted in their constant and brave resolutions, to which purpose they seemed in some sort to have assembled themselves, with an intention to contend against the present Government, by some violent manner of prosecution; though for the better colour of their actions and intentions, they appeared onely with petitions in their hands, instead of other weapons of danger. With these thoughts, I held it my best course to retire into the very heart or body of the City of Sardis , as well to feel the pulse and constitution of the Inhabitants, as the likelier to be informed by their intelligence, concerning all other proceedings of the Kingdom: Neither in this design, was I much deceived in my expectation, for sorting my conversation with watermen and other inferiour people, I understood, that as the rich Citizens of the Town; although they desire again to have their King to govern over them, though with some restriction in his power, because they fear his revenge, since otherwise as they believe, they could probably expect nothing but a general confusion, so of the other side it is apparent the multitude for the most part desire a change; not onely in regard of the envy they bear to the Senate, who more absolutely command over their persons and estates, then the King ever did in his greatest glory, but also in regard, they doubt the Souldiers at the last, will come to be Masters of every mans fortune; which jurisdiction of all others, they most detest in their natures and dispositions. As I was sufficiently satisfied in these inclinations of the people, I repaired to the publick place of commerce for the whole City, where (in short) amongst the Merchants I understood, that not onely a great part of the Navy was revolted to the King (the Marriners being encouraged thereunto, by some Senators which Farezius the General had formerly sent into banishment) but that the Myssians were also preparing a great Army, by the directions of the Kingdom of Syria , suddenly to invade Lydia , on the Kings behalf. These news giving my endeavours sufficient encouragement, still to prosecute my design for other intelligences, within three or four dayes afterward, I became certainly informed, that the Senate being not able, or at leastwise not willing to give the multitude satisfaction, according to the desire of their Petitions, they had in great numbers not onely taken up arms for their own defence, in regard they understood that Farezius had directions, notwithstanding the opposition of the Lords, to march towards their assemblies with all his power, but they had also seized upon many Castles and Towns, towards their enterprise and assistance in the Kings name; with whom in like manner many of the Nobility joyn with considerable Forces. Last of all, you may be pleased to know, that Hercrombrotus , Lieutenant General to Farezius , is of a sudden called away with a great part of the Army, towards the Confines of Lydia , near the City of Smyrna , occasioned by reason of the revolt of some of his own Commanders, who are joyned with the power and force of the Countrey to oppose the Senates proceeding: which in effect is the full information I can give concerning my imployment. When the Dwarf had made an end of this relation, the Princess Cloria smiled upon her Brother, not onely to see how well the boy had performed his office, according to the confidence her Governess Roxana had in his wit and fidelity; but withal in regard of the inward joy she felt concerning the King her Fathers affairs, that seemed now to be in a better posture then they were, almost since the beginning of his troubles: for she imagined by the consequences, his Subjects would be constrained for their own advantages, to place him again in his Throne, in a higher capacity of power then before. Ascanius of the other side, expressed also by his countenance the like gladness, insomuch as after a little space, as if he had been in a manner transported with thoughts of delight and satisfaction, according to his youthful conceptions, that were apt enough to entertain all Ideas of content and felicity, presently run to his Sister, and whilst both his armes were cast about her neck, he sealed, as well his affection as his joy upon her ruby lips, by a multitude of sweet, though more dear kisses: But she at last, either something apprehending the too much importunity of such affections, or else desirous to inform her self better of other particulars, told her Brother in a jesting way, that as she could scarce dispence with the rigid rules of her own modesty, to have her virgin lips so assaulted, although it were from an affectionate Brother, whose innocent vertue was beyond all possibility of scandal, so did she of the other side exceedingly wonder, that his own change of condition, which onely procured his safety, under the protection of the Castle, where for the present they remained, had not wrought in his disposition contrary effects, to that quality wherein he was born, since now he was to esteem himself rather a servant to fortune, then a Prince by extraction: Not a Prince, replyed Ascanus? the Gods defend, I should ever harbour in my breast such poor and unworthy thoughts, notwithstanding the injustice or malice of any fortune whatsoever: No Sister, be you assured, that both for your sake and my own, I shall alwayes endeavour by my actions, to shew that I am Son to Euarchus and Hyacinthia ; and I doubt not but you will do the like concerning your own particular: But yet, replyed the sweet Princess, we are obliged in some sort to yield to our fates, when we have no means sufficient left us to prevent them; for if the Senate, by a certain kinde of a tyrannical power granted them by the heavens (perhaps onely in correction of our offences) do imprison and circumscribe our persons, what matters of consequence can our mindes afford us to our advantage in such exigencies? O say not so, answered Ascanius ; for the minde is able to be a noble conquerour over all unfortunate disasters; since in my youthful studies I have read of many brave persons, that in the highest expressions of tyranny, and afflictions imposed upon their bodies, by their worst and greatest enemies, have at last in despight of all their cruelty, born away the onely Palm and Lawrel of Victory; as it were confounding their very persecutors, with the extraordinary constancy of their own sufferings. These, said Cloria , I must confess are brave resolutions in words, if they can be as well practised by actions: For I must tell you, that flesh and blood cannot easily put off all natural inclinations; though I will not deny, but the soul may do miracles, being aided by divine considerations; and oftentimes hath demonstrated wonderful effects, meerly out of some extraordinary sense, or inflamation of hononr, both by Souldiers and Philosophers, Truly, said Ascanius , then it were very hard, being Kings Children, if we should not in our proceedings meet with some of these faculties to our benefit; when as perhaps contemptible slaves in former ages, have abundantly exampled to our knowledge and edification, such heroical suffering. As they were thus discoursing, Roxana , who had for a long space kept a most formal and grave silence, thought it also convenient to shew her own wisdome; the rather, since her years and experience, pretended to a certain kinde of prerogative amongst those of the younger sort of people. Truly, said she, as I cannot deny, but that this extraordinary courage you mention, is of a singular benefit to many sorts of people, in their pressing and difficult occasions; yet when with a wise (though not a base) complyance, we can avoid both the inconvenience and hazzard to our selves, with more ease and no dishonour, I see no reason, why we should go about to strain nature to no purpose? especially if we be not well assured to gain a beneficial victory by the contention; and if we fail in that we seem to undertake, we contract thereby a further mischief and disreputation to our selves, then if we had not at all offered to contend against power and oppression at the first: Besides oftentimes those resistances in the dark shall never come truly to the knowledge of the world; so that consequently we fail then of that glory, our foolish and preposterous ambition aimed at by such resolutions; by which means we shall be rather interpreted to be blown up with vain glorious fumes, then seasoned with true fortitude: In fine, the best mixture must be so to moderate our actions, that as precipitately we put not our selves upon vain and needless sufferings, without necessity, so ought not we too much to yield to the inconstant strokes of fortune and oppression, when either Honour or Religion, calls us to a publick demonstration of our bravery and courage. But however these disputations might either confirm Cloria , or convert her Brother, yet Ascanius finding the opportunity, for his own desired imployment in the Kings affairs, he resolved as soon as possible he could, to seek occasion for his own speedy departure, which did not a little afflict the considerations of his sweet Sister the Princess Cloria , who began to contract a most singular delight in the witty conversation of her dear Brother. Nevertheless she resolved not to be so great a friend to her own passions, as to become thereby an enemy to his honour, and her Fathers prosperity: So that this being after some consultation determined on all sides, Ascanius intended in some new disguise, like a boy belonging to the Navy, to steal privately away to Sea, under the protection of those officers, that might afford him the conveniency, and repair to those Ships that had revolted from the Senates service. Of the Princess CLORIA. imployed in the revolted Ships, yet the Senates suspicion, by reason of those peremptory Petitions they had received from the people in the Kings behalf, made them more cautious to secure Cloria in her confinement: To this purpose, whilst Ascanius was providing the best conveniency he could for his departure, of a sudden a new guard was set upon the Castle, as it was pretended onely to keep a stricter eye over all the prisoners within that jurisdiction, who were to deny entrance to every stranger whatsoever, without an exact examination both of his quality and business. The execution of this determination, troubled the thoughts extreamly of Cloria, Ascanius , and Roxana , as well for that it hindred their designs, in many particulars concerning their own resolutions, as that by this means, they were probably debarred from those intelligences that might prove beneficial to the Kings affairs: For however the Princess Cloria , seemed oftentimes reasonably well pacified, in regard she enjoyed the sweet conversation of her dear Brother; yet he being enflamed with the desire of action, not seldom with a great deal of violence, complained concerning the injustice and cruelty of the Senates decrees; as I may say, quarrelling with his own Fates, that so spitefully circumscribed him contrary to his nature: Nevertheless he was perswaded by Roxana to a competent patience, for fear of some prejudice to his own person; since it was to be supposed, the strictness of the watch proceeded chiefly from the grounds arising from his escape: But reasons for the most part that belong to moderation, are not at all times prevalent with youthful disposition, where either ambition or other passions predominate; yet in regard the young couple enjoyed a supreme felicity in each others company, and that they doubted not but that their Fathers affairs went on in a most happy condition, they were perswaded at last, to attend both with patience and ignorance the event of things for a little time longer: notwithstanding the Princess Cloria could scarce be inwardly satisfied in her thoughts, in that since his departure, she had not heard one word from Narcissus ; and the rather was she troubled, in respect this new guard as she believed, could not chuse but contribute much to the obstructing of all future intelligence: Although Roxana , upon every occasion by discourses, endeavoured to settle her minde both to hopes and assurances, nevertheless she knew very well the old Duke was dead, and that withal Eumenes and Eretheria were in possession of the Island of Cyprus , which secret however she never durst in any kinde reveal to her Mistriss. As one day Roxana was at a window in the Castle, that had its view directed towards the River Pactolus , which lay under it at no far distance, that affords a large commodity upon the Wharf, or borders of the Stream, to those that either had business in the place, or were in their dispositions delighted with the recreation of walking; in this posture she observed a man habited like an Outlandish Sailor, who with a certain kinde of solicitous diligence, looked up at the window where she stood, as if he either wondered at her confinement, or had a desire to entertain some correspondency with her concernments. These actions or demeanours of the party, busied something her consideration for the present, yet not knowing well what to think either of her self or him, for that she supposed very probably, he might be onely a spy to betray her to a more strict imprisonment, for that time withdrew her self from any manner of observation: Nevertheless the next day she came to the same window again, not so much for the like recreation, as that she had retained in her fancy all the night, some Idea's of the fellow actions, and countenance; as it were being perswaded by the strength of her imagination, that if she should happen to see him any more, she might either know his person, or be informed of his business, which she began to believe, absolutely was intended to her in particular, in that he seemed not onely to have been intentive to some purposes in his minde, but also in regard he was a stranger, and in that manner appeared habited, though many Seamen of other Countries, by reason of merchandize and trade belonging to the rich City of Sardis , were accustomed to repair to that place, as well as to other great Towns in Lydia: Roxana , as I say, was scarce seated again in the window, but she might see the very same person to walk, as the day before, upon the Banks of the River, oftentimes casting up his eyes towards the place where she was. This gave the old woman, after some more consideration, as well an appetite of curiosity, as a hope to be informed by himself; wherefore at last putting off both her fear and doubt, of bringing any inconveniency upon their present condition, notwithstanding what injunction or prohibition soever, beckened with her hand to the fellow to come nearer the window; which she might the better do without danger, by reason the noon season had well high freed the Wharf, from all the accustomed company that daily frequented the Water-side; He approaching at this summons, she let fall a little piece of paper, wherein she had writ with the point of her bodkin these intimations: That if he had any thing in commission necessary to be delivered to her knowledge, he should particularly write his minde to that purpose, and that night late repair to the same place again, where she would be ready attending with a long string, unto which he might fasten his writing. As soon as the fellow had read this small note, with a seeming joyful countenance, holding his finger to his mouth, as a sign of secrecy and consent, he went away. Roxana imployed most of the afternoon in considerations, what might be the event, as well as the occasion of this strange adventure; withal resolving to be most diligent and punctual in the time; though in the interim, she determined not to make either Cloria or any other acquainted with her summons: According to her hour she came to the window, where already she found her intelligencer waiting for her presence; and presently after that Roxana had let down the string, he fastened a paper unto it, that contained this information: It is enough to say, that I am the messenger that was sent by you not many moneths since into Syria, from whence I am newly arrived, under the shelter of this disguise, for fear of discovery, understanding the strict guard that is lately set upon the Castle: Wherefore if you please to morrow night, about one of the clock, to be at the water-gate belonging to the Fort, I have found out such an invention, that at the outside I can wait upon you, with what conveniency you please, whereby to impart unto your self many remarkable and beneficial passages, belonging as well to the Kingdom of Syria, as to the Island of Cyprus, with other places, that may both content the Princess, and contribute to the Kings affairs . Roxana , when she had read this Letter, as it may be thought, with a sufficient content, not using any other circumstance in returning an answer, then again with the point of her bodkin signifying her consent, she resolved, that however she was not altogether ignorant of the place he mentioned; yet for her better instruction, she would in the interim be informed concerning the particular commodities thereof: The writing being received accordingly by the messenger, she instantly withdrew the candle from the window, for fear of some unhappy discovery, knowing that many Sentinels, during the night season, were dispersed in divers places throughout the whole Castle. As Roxana could not chuse already, but be extreamly satisfied with this unexpected encounter; so in the morning was she both careful and diligent, to impart her intelligence to Cloria and Ascanius: After she had fully made them acquainted with the passages and appointment, the hours seemed longer then ordinary to them all, until the time should come for the meeting, though each remained in the mean space sufficiently pleased, with various discourses and conjectural imaginations, concerning those things the party might deliver, wherein you may be sure, the Princess Cloria was no way backward in her apprehension, about the state and welfare of her dear Narcissus: It was Roxana's fortune to be at the rendezvouz a little before the servant of Ascanius came, which caused her to entertain her thoughts and person, in a small alley belonging to the place: but he within a quarter of an hours time in like manner arriving, and having saluted each other with a few cemplements of congratulation for so happy a meeting, considering the unfortunate restraint was newly put upon the Princess, the party made unto her this relation of his travels, both standing upon two steps of each side of the Iron-grate, at least a foot and a half above the water. The first journey I made, said he, after I parted from the Kingdom of Lydia , was into the Island of Cyprus , in regard of those special commands I had been enjoyned from the Princess Cloria , to enquire after the affairs and comportment of the young Lord Narcissus ; for that, as she told me, she was extreamly beholding both to him and his Father, for the many courtesies she and the Queen her Mother had received from the Countrey, and other places under their jurisdiction and command: but upon my arrival in that Island, I found not onely the old Duke dead, but the Possession and Government of the Countrey enjoyed by Eumenes , who had then newly married the Lady Eretheria , the Dukes Daughter, in regard, as it was supposed by all the people, her Brother the Lord Narcissus , had by some unfortunate accident or other miscarried, since no news had been heard of his welfare for a long season: Nevertheless as it should seem, the Gods determined otherwise of the business, for within some few moneths after the Dukes death, Narcissus himself in a certain disguise coming into the Countrey, it was not long before he found conveniency privately to speak with his Sister Eretheria , she being one day, according to her custom, retired into pleasant walks belonging to the Court, for the exercising and recreation of her poetical fancy, in which faculty she seems to take a most singular delight. This by the way, would occasion a pretty story, concerning the loves between Eumenes and her self, if the season at present could any way afford the conveniency: But the troublesome posture wherein we both now remain, shall confine me rather to matters necessary to be related, then to those circumstances that pretend more to delight then business; so that onely be pleased to know, that Narcissus having thus encountered his Sister in his disguise, told her he was a messenger sent by her Brother Narcissus into Cyprus , though being retarded by the way, by reason of an unfortunate surprize by Pyrates, withal finding the old Duke dead, unto whom was chiefly directed his intention, he thought it most convenient (she being the onely heir of the House and Family) as a necessary duty belonging to his Commission, to make her acquainted with her Brothers fortunes: These words continued Eretheria a long time in a trembling muse, as it were labouring within her self, between sorrow and amazement, fearing to hear the manner of that repeated, which for many moneths past she had been made already most assured of in her own opinion: In conclusion he told her a story of his being taken at Sea by a Ship of Pamphylia , with his detention there in prison, though yet undiscovered by himself, for fear of augmenting his ransom, in regard of the agreements between the two Countries during the Wars, which was to set no certain price upon either of the Generals, or any of their Family, so that he could not expect a release without some powerful means used to that purpose, being taken at Sea; and the rather, for that those people began partly to suspect his quality and condition: It is not to be questioned but that this relation gave as much occasion to Eretheria of suspicion as wonder; yet more she inclined her self to believe, he was some designed Impostor, sent on purpose to raise tumults in the Countrey, whereby to trouble them in their peaceable Government, then that it was possible her Brother could be living, in regard so large a space had been past without hearing any thing from him; much less could she bring her opinion to give credit to the manner of his story: However, at last, after something a long pause, as if her affectionate passions had got the victory over all probable reasons to the contrary, with many tears standing in her fair eyes, she uttered these words: And is it possible , said she, my Brother is yet living, to whose right, if it be so, we must of necessity resign all our hitherunto usurped Authority . With this she wisht the messenger to stay in that place, until she had informed Eumenes her Husband with the news: It was not much above a quarter of an hours time before she brought Eumenes in person, whereby to be confirmed by more particular circumstances, concerning the truth of what had been related, who by chance was also walking in another part of the same Park for his recreation. After he had interrogated the messenger with something an exact curiosity, as it should seem, not being willing to be couzened either out of command or honour, notwithstanding Eretheria his Wife appeared a little violent in her belief, proceeding from the precipitate inclinations of her natural affection, at last he became in a manner also absolutely satisfied in all those particulars he could demand: But in the interim nevertheless, diversity of passions might be observed in the countenance of Eumenes , combating with his noble thoughts, whether justice or ambition should get the mastery over his determinations; since the continuance of his own present glory, could not well be maintained, without a great deal of apparent injury done to the rightful inheritance of brave Narcissus , who had performed such remarkable and gallant services at the Siege of Memphis in Egypt , to the admiration almost of all Asia . In conclusion, after these considerations, had for something a long season struggled in his Heroical breast, at last with some seeming passion he broke out into these expressions: The Gods defend , said he, that I should deprive my Brother Narcissus, if he be alive, of that right which so justly belongs both to his descent and merits, since not onely the dead Duke, but living Fame, intended him the purchase: Yet that the world may not too much tax my credulity, upon over-light and improbable grounds, I must in the interim study some way for the more assuredness of the relation; and the rather for that no less then the power of our whole Countrey can be certain to release him from his confinement (as you seem to intimate;) wherefore I shall make the States of the Island of Cyprus acquainted with the intelligence, from whose purses, if not allowance, do move for the most part all great actions that concern the people; and we being now in Treaty with the Egyptians, towards the concluding of some happy Peace between Cyprus and Pamphylia, a more fortunate occasion seemeth to be offered for his service then ordinary: which notwithstanding failing in any particular, that may either appertain to his Honour or Liberty, I shall not be sparing of my own blood, to redeem that gallant Captive Narcissus, from any subjection at present, or hereafter, to what Prince or Nation soever . These expressions, as he thought, both from his Sister and Eumenes , being motives sufficient to cause him to discover himself, he presently took from the side of his face a long black patch, that did not a little obscure him from common knowledge, which had been artificially contrived to that purpose: then desired Eretheria to look well upon his countenance, and consider whether according to her remembrance, she knew his person, or could call to minde she had ever seen the same before: But his words rather procuring amazement then satisfaction to her thoughts (for that the Wars and his other travels had much changed his looks since their last parting, who was then a great deal more effeminate both in his complexion and aspect) he presently putting his hand, into a small pocket he had of the one side of his garment, quickly plucked out a curious enamelled Case, which formerly had been the gift of Eretheria her self, and that being opened, he shewed her his own picture and hers so lively represented, that there was now no more question to be made of the messenger: This confirmation of his safety, shewed the way as I may say, to a thousand embracements, as full of joy as love, which in a short time rendred the whole Island perfectly contented, in that as the people expected wonders from their new recovered Prince, so Eretheria and Eumenes held it a sufficient honour and happiness to their condition, to see their gallant Brother, in possession of what they had unknowingly for some space usurped from his right. It was not long after the finishing of these notable, Congratulations, when my self before my passage into Syria , hearing that the young Duke Narcissus was at his Court at Paphos , expecting some Messengers or Ambassadours from the King of Egypt , whereby to conclude the Treaty of Peace with the Countrey of Pamphilia , went unto him, not onely to inform him concerning the state of the Princess Cloria , but also to receive his direction touching my employment to the City of Damascus , where our Queen, as I was told, for that present remained. I must confess I am not able to express the joy he conceived to hear of the Princess; and vowed by all the Gods, that after he had settled his own affairs in such posture; that he could absolutely command the Countrey, he would transport a gallant Army into the Kingdom of Lydia for her belief; withal he told me, he intended to make a journey himself in person to Damascus , to confer with that State concerning particulars to that effect: These instructions and intimations were enough as I thought for the present, to carry with me in my journey, that quickly landed me at Tyre: But he being come to this point, having past over the principal part of that period Roxana desired, which was the safety and prosperous condition of young Narcissus , she wisht the messenger to keep the finishing of his relation for the next nights conference, not onely in regard of the inconvenient posture wherein they both stood at the instant, but also for that she knew, her Mistress the Princess with a great deal of impatiency attended her coming, who had resolved not to go to bed before her return. This soon parted them both, with an agreement the next night to meet at that very place, however with what better commodity they could in the interim invent, for either of their particulars, in regard the highness of the water being so near their station, did render the conference cold and inconvenient. It is not to be doubted, but that this relation did sufficiently satisfie the Princesse Cloria , who after Roxana had delivered all the particulars, with as many delightfull circumstances as her tongue and fancy could with any probability invent, not destroying the truth of the story, she called up her Brother Ascanius to be again anew informed by her self, being a little before faln asleep upon a Pallet in her chamber: neither of them almost could be gotten to bed the rest of the night, notwithstanding any perswasion of Roxana ; both as it were filled with so much joy, that they seemed to entertain a belief, as if sleep were of too dull a nature and property, to be welcom'd with such Idea's of felicity, as they for the present entertained in their fancies and imaginations: For as the Princess Cloria esteemed her imprisonment nothing, now her dear Narcissus was safe, and Duke of Cyprus , from whose assistance in a manner she presumed, if need were, upon a miraculous redemption; so of the other side, were Ascanius thoughts so transported with the desire of action and employment, that but onely hearing that Narcissus meant to land a strong Army in the Kingdom of Lydia , towards the King his Fathers restoration, he appeared to be as it were already in possession of his wishes, though yet a concealed prisoner in his Sisters Chamber. But however this youthful couple fed themselves with delight enough, upon the very score of their own fancies, yet better experienced Roxana , was both cautious and certain in her determinations; to which purpose the next night following, she was resolved to keep her appointment, hoping by the other part of the intelligence that was behinde, to get out something more for their advantages. When she and Mercuris met, (for so was the intrusted servant to Prince Ascanius called) they placed themselves for their conference, at the other end of the Iron-grate , where by chance they found out a commodity answerable to their desires, and that was two seats cut out in the wall of either side, belike ordained in time of War, for the better conveniency of Sentinels; which being also elevated three or four steps above the water, they were freed from the incumbrance of noise and cold: After they were both seated, Roxana to her necessary attentiveness, as Mercuris to his particular relations, this discourse was the subject of their endeavours. Being landed at Tyre , said Mercuris , as I told you before, I was quickly informed of many stirs (if not rather to be esteemed plain Rebellions) that were already begun in the Kingdom of Syria , and more particularly by the great and mighty City of Damascus , which at that present had drawn most of all the Court-Forces, in a kinde of a formal siege round about the Town; an accident that seemed something to obstruct my designs, in regard I knew not well where to finde Hyacinthia our Queen; much less could I be confident, to have a sufficient opportunity to prosecute with any considerable effect, the sending of Souldiers into Lydia , towards King Euarchus assistance: To let you know the true causes of this War, were a work of too much presumption for my experience, since diversity of Interests for the most part, use to be the occasion of such alterations; onely according to common report it was given out, that the people being over-burthened with Taxations, by reason of the continued Hostility between Sorastros King of Egypt , and the State of Syria , is the cause: But if I may adde to these conjectures, my own thoughts and opinion, I rather believe the obstinacy proceeds from some innate ambition in divers of the Nobility, and especially in the House of one Condris , whose Ancestors opposed their Kings with the like, if not greater violence in all times: Nevertheless it is conceived by most, that Queen Andromida , who hath the young King under her jurisdiction, by reason of his few years, together with a certain Favourite of hers called Mazarius , is extreamly to blame concerning the present troubles, for fear of letting go the absolute management of affairs, which as she is perswaded, she can better maintain by a lasting War then a settled Peace; wherefore will not by any means, make an accord of friendship, though it be with her own Brother Sorastros King of Egypt , notwithstanding the general cries of the common people to that purpose: Yet for her excuse she pretends, she cannot safely conclude the Peace desired, until the young King comes of years, in regard her late Husband Orsames , and his Councel before his death, prescribed her the conditions, which the Egyptians will not condescend unto. As these are the diversities of sayings and allegations of all sides; so shall I not need to trouble you with any more particulars of this nature, but will leave the rest to the issue and success, and onely let you know what most concerns our own affairs. Although these accidental troubles at Damascus (as I thought) would not onely something hinder my journey, but obstruct your designs, yet it was my good fortune to speak with our Queen Hyacinthia , at a house designed her by the State for her abode, during the heat of the Wars in hand: I shall not need to express, with what extraordinary joy, she entertained from my relation the news of her Daughters welfare, and my Lord her Sons escape: however she seemed a little afflicted, that these unfortunate differences, newly begun in the Kingdom of Syria , did in some sort unhappily cross the resolutions, and affectionate intendments of Narcissus Duke of Cyprus , in regard that the Court of Syria was for the present, desperately employed in occasions of their own; nevertheless she assured me, that as soon as the Queen Andromida had quieted these stirs, and settled a more quiet Government in her own Dominions, for her Sons honour and Syria's safety, King Euarchus her Husband should not fail of what assistance she could possibly afford him, whereby again to settle him in his now almost lost Dominion. Withal she let me know, as a secret of a more special nature, that before many moneths were ended, the Myssians would lead a gallant and well provided Army into Lydia , not onely to release the King from his imprisonment, but to establish him in his Throne. As I was something unmannerly, to seem in this particular doubtful of the Queens intelligence, for that I conceived both Argylius and Lycius , with their faction, would as much as they could oppose the design; so of the other side, finding my diffidence as well by my countenance as by my expression, she became so good and gracious towards my satisfaction, as to make me acquainted with the information, which as she said, she had lately received out of Myssia . You must know, said she, that although Argylius and Lycius , have endeavored all they could, to obstruct and hinder the proceedings of the Kings affairs in the Countrey of Myssia , yet by the powerful agitation of a great Nobleman, named Aranus in the same Kingdom, the design is so far advanced already, that not onely a brave Army, under his conduct and command, shall be prepared to march speedily into Lydia , against the power of the Senate , who for the present detains Euarchus in prison, but also many strong frontier Towns have promised to yield to the obedience and jurisdiction of the King; which being joyned to other Factions, and violent motions of the common people of Lydia , it is impossible, but such effects will be produced thereby, that the ancient prerogative of the Crown, in all probability must quickly be restored again to himself and posterity; especially considering the late revolt of a great part of the Navy. These reasons I must confess, being delivered with confidence from so discreet a Majesty, could not but convert my thoughts to an absolute belief, and that belief in a manner assured me of the success according to my wishes; which made me less troubled with the present unfortunate accidents of Syria: so that I resolved with what conveniency I could, to return again into Lydia , as a willing bearer of these joyful tidings: As I desired the Queen to know what service she would command me to that purpose; so she, after some few dayes of consideration told me, that she durst not commit anything to paper of these Transactions, for fear of interception in my voyage; yet would she have me by word of mouth, to signifie unto her Son Ascanius , that as she was extream joyful at his happy escape from his Keepers, under the jurisdiction of the Senate , having been so long a time confined by that power; so did she think it convenient for the present, to put him in minde both of his own honour and his Fathers concernments; which as she said, required a speedy expedition into the Kingdom of Syria , where no doubt but he would meet with noble employments, answerable to his youth and dignity. To be short, having received these Injunctions from the Queen, when I had also saluted Prince Arethusius , I embarqued for this Kingdom of Lydia , where being arrived, I met with an Army newly raised by the people of the Countrey of Caria , towards the making good of their priviledges, according to a late Petition they had presented the Senate to that purpose: My self also being by accident engaged in this company, I went along with their Troops towards the making good of a certain passage over a bridge; and the rather was I consenting to this employment, for that I became certainly informed, how it was impossible for any person whatsoever, to have any admittance to the speech of the Princess Cloria , by reason of a new restriction imposed upon this Castle, proceeding, as was said, from the fears and jealousies of the Senate, conceiving their condition was in some danger and hazzard; not onely in regard of these conjunctures of affairs, but also for that my Lord Ascanius had strangely broke from their custody, by reason of too much neglect (if not treason) in his Keepers; some of them being already in question before Commissioners appointed to that purpose. To be short, in prosecution of our design, we were no sooner placed upon the bridge, whereby the better to defend and secure the passage into our own Countrey, or to be ready, if occasion served, to advance towards the City of Sardis , but we might see Farezius with the best part of his Army, in a most fierce and violent march, to hasten against our Forces: This, I must confess, made many of our great, though fearful Commanders, presently with some Troops desert the service, which you may be sure put us in no small distraction; and the rather, for that most of our power consisted in common people, who were not at all practised in the stratagems of War: upon these sudden affrights, our Souldiers being at the same instant furiously charged by many of the best Companies in Farezius Army, we were constrained with a great deal of slaughter of both sides, and some disorder onely on ours, to quit the passage, until a brave Commander named Leonides , joyning with two or three other Captains of equal courage, not onely anew began to head our flying and distracted Companies, but with a world of prudence, as well as valour, made good unto our Army, a safe retreat, by the cutting down of another bridge; until at last both himself and most of our best. Troops (I being also involved in the same number) were secured in an old Town named Cleosa , which had been formerly famed for her antiquity, as at present in her pleasant and delightful scituation. Mercuris would have made some stop here of his discourse, desiring to refer the rest to another conference, for that as he doubted, the inconvenience of the season might else prejudice Roxana in her health, but belike the old woman conceiving her self to be of a stronger temper, or at leastwise her passion to understand farther of his relation, (since their late restraint debarred them in a manner from all intelligence) gave her a confident opinion to the contrary: so that Mercuris was invited to a continuation of his relation, It was not long (said he) after we had fortified the place, before Farezius appeared with his whole Army to besiege the City, at which time he sent up also, as we understood, to the Senate at Sardis , to have a larger Authority for his actions: nevertheless he kept still at some distance, as it were rather frighting us with an opinion of his intentions whereby to make us the sooner yield to a willing compliance with his purposes, then that he was very forward to set upon our fortifications; conceiving belike that the desperateness of our condition, might too much endanger his Forces upon any resolute attempt he should make, supposing he should have work enough at the best, to encounter with many other difficulties, since he knew multitudes of factions, began daily to arise in the Kingdom against his proceedings: But we, whether more provoked by our courages or our hopes, finding he made a stand with his Troops, quickly issued out of the Town with such a violence, as if nothing but slaughter and destruction could satisfie the raging spleen, that seemed to be created in our enflamed bosoms: This brought on (though I say it) an encounter worth fames best observation, for the General not to appear any way backward in his resolution, though policy had for some space made him consider what was to be done, of most advantage to those other ends he had in his minde, perceiving our intentions were to give him battel, led on himself in person, those Souldiers he had ordered for the first charge; and with so much fury, that as he lost multitudes out of his own Army by our valours, so not a few of our brave Commanders sacrificed their lives by reason of his numbers: And truly this served, but to sharpen the points of our swords to more devastations, since in an instant on both sides, our Troops and Companies began to be divided, onely by heaps of dead bodies, that appeared in some fort to be circumscribed by bounds, or rather Rivers of blood, whilst the living were forced to seek out new paths for agitation, wherein friends were no more pitied after their fall, then enemies spared in the fight: I must confess, the very God of War himself might have entertained thoughts of compassion in his unrelenting breast, if he had been but present at those slaughters: This for a long season continued the dispute so equal in all our opinions, that every man in the action, seemed to expect for his reward no less a prize then Euarchus Crown: But Farezius , whether finding that his men had some inclination to retire, by which means as he thought, those other supplies he speedily expected from the rest of his party, might be disincouraged to hasten to his aid; or that he had some other design or stratagem in his imagination, since his valour and courage were never yet suspected by his greatest enemies, of a sudden, when almost every Souldier attended with impatiency the determinable success of the battle, as if the issue onely had been to lead and direct their eternal fates hereafter, as well as their present fortune and felicity upon Earth, caused the retreat to be sounded: But this resolution, however it suited well enough with the time of the day, for that the evening began hastily to approach; yet we of the Town were scarce satisfied with the execution, since our heated passions, if not invincible hopes, were carried on with violence, to compass something that might utterly discourage Farezius , from continuing any longer siege about the City: Nevertheless he had other determinations, which were upon safe grounds, rather to maintain the power and force of his Army entire, (since he knew many, if not most of the Kingdom were utterly against his prosperity) then to hazzard those Souldiers any farther, who were absolutely true as he believed to his purposes, in a doubtful and desperate contention; especially, for that he might make use of fortified Trenches, (which already in that place he found in a manner made to his hand by some former encampment) to keep us within our bounds, although he very much apprehended the tediousness of the siege, with the uncertainty of success of his other Forces, he had sent into many parts of the Kingdom, to suppress and keep down other peremptory Assemblies that seemed at that instant to contend both with his and the Senates Jurisdiction. Nevertheless, as I told you, although we were extream sorry thus to suffer our enemies to part away, as it were upon equall terms, from those harsh and unwelcome entertainments we intended them; yet perceiving that the most part of the Army had already secured themselves within those Trenches I mentioned, and that a great Squadron or reserve of Horse (which untill then we had not discovered, being sheltred behinde a dark coverture of a thick wood) seemed to intend, as if they aimed to get between us and the Town, we thought it best also to retire into the City, with what orderly speed we could possibly make, whereby the Enemy might have no advantage at all of our haste, either in effect or opinion. Farezius being taught by the experience of this dayes conflict, that the contenders were not onely fortified with brave resolutions, but led also by gallant Commanders, began to think it his best way, rather to endeavour the reducement of the place to his obedience, by some gentle Treaty of Peace, then still to continue his resolutions to become Master of the Town by force of Arms; for by the one he thought he might obtain his desires with less prejudice to his affairs, when as by the other he was most certain to pay dear enough for the purchase: besides he feared, that if the siege should last for any considerable time, both his power and fortunes that had hitherunto been held in some veneration by the common multitude, would become contemptible and despised; which joyned with the discontents of the people, and the general report that had already spread it self abroad concerning the Myssians intentions of invading of Lydia ; enflamed more his desires upon this score to bring about his purposes; the rather, for that he knew he had not a few enemies, both in the Senate , and the rich City of Sardis ; who, however they did not in any kinde affect the Kings prosperity, yet were they inclinable enough to suppresse his overmuch greatness and esteem, that they might be able, when they pleased, either to controul his power, or secure their own estates. Upon these considerations, I say, Farezius resolved to try, if fair perswasions could bring about that with expedition, which he knew with hard labour and hazzardable adventures, he could but compass in many moneths; so that the next morning after this determination, he dispatched a Herauld of his own privately into the Town; the Messenger being brought before Leonides with his eyes banded, he delivered his embassie in this manner: Sir , said he, I am sent from Farezius with Mercy instead of Slaughter; if you willingly entertain such offers he shall make, you may become his loving friends, in lieu of being esteemed obstinate enemies to the State: This not onely will put you again in your fortunes and possessions, but render you absolute happy, by enjoying freely those Priviledges that belong to the Senates party; when as the Tenders in the general being refused, what the power of his conquering Sword can purchase, you must expect in full rigour. Leonides not being willing to hear more of this language, he wisht the Herauld in short to deliver his Proposals, since, as he said, they should be very well able to judge of the consequences of his demands, without being either terrified by his threats, or perswaded by his flatteries: This answer made the messenger quickly pull out of his pocket; that which contained these demands. First, it was required that Leonides should within three days space deliver the Town under his jurisdiction into the absolute possession of the Generals command without any farther contention: Next, that all the Souldiers under his directions should forthwith lay down their Arms, again to receive them if they pleased from the Senates Authority? And lastly, by some formal expressions, they were to acknowledge their misprisions, in undertaking a design of such a dangerous consequence to the Kingdom of Lydia : Of the other side they were promised a large pardon for what was past; a present and entire restoration of all their possessions; and to be put not onely into the favour of the Senate, in the same nature and equality of other Subjects, but to be preferred upon all occasions, both in the Wars and Offices of the Commonwealth. When Leonides had fully understood these Propositions, with a certain kinde of grave, though scornful smile, he appointed the Messenger to be there detained, until he had conferred with his chief Officers about some answer to be returned to the General; without whose advice, as he said, he would not undertake to proceed in any thing that belonged to his Government: After he had assembled together his principal Commanders, he made unto them this Speech. Gentlemen, said he , you see we are invited by this Messengers endeavours, to an absolute compliance with the General of the Senates Forces; whether this be done onely to corrupt our fidelities, or betray our Honours, I will not dispute; nevertheless with confidence enough I may affirm, that these Propositions are sent, rather for their advantages from whence they come, then for our good to whom they are tendred, since you must give me leave more to suspect their intentions, then to believe their natures can be converted by any Rules or Maximes of pitty, to save us or the Town from violence, if a greater benefit to their Cause, may at all be procured by the contrary. These Reasons, I suppose, are weighty enough to make us cautious, if not suspicious, in our proceedings; especially not having many examples of mercy laid before our eyes, to render us absolutely confident in businesses of this nature, when since the beginning of the Wars, where power and opportunity had the upper hand, what one proof have we had of their lenity? It is apparent, that condescending to this Submission, we shall be no more our own in will, but theirs in subjection; and so consequently by that means be devested of all probable defence, if we be afterward injured: Wherefore let us at least well consider, before we yield to that we can never after recall; nay, put the case the General should be as noble in his performances, as he hath shewed himself courageous in his employment, yet most certain it is, our conditions must receive an ample confirmation from Sardis , to make them binding and beneficial on our behalfs: For many Presidents we have, where Articles have been often broken, when no other seal was fixt to their validity, but what was formed by the Souldiers without the Senates consent and approbation; and scarce those or any tyes at all, have been sufficient to defend sacred Accords from violence, when either profit or other ends came in place, to dispute both publick and private interest: No, my friends, and dear fellows and companions in Arms, said he , let us either purchase an absolute freedom and security by our swords, whereby we may gain our own conditions, without the controul of other Masters but our King, for whom we have professed onely to take up Arms; or let our blood and honours be buried together in one grave, to teach worth and truth to posterity, who may thereby after our deaths be instructed towards the forming of such Governments, as may make both them and us famous in the world to some convenient eternity: Doing the contrary, we shall continually discontent our own imaginations, without purchasing any thing but a certain slavery, made up between opinion and possessing liberty, let their promises and assurances be what they will in our behalfs; for however they may keep their words awhile with us, which is better then we can expect at their hands, yet in our own thoughts we shall never esteem our condition other then as persons conquered, though pardoned in some measure; from whence these effects will necessarily arise, That as by our friends we shall be alwayes contemned in a high measure, so by our enemies we can never be trusted in any kinde, when as either dying, or performing what we undertook, at the best we shall become Victors, and at the worst leave behinde us a glorious character. These words being said, without any other dispute whatsoever, they all yielded both to his reasons and resolution, adding this farther Decree, That the Messenger should be sent away, though without affront or injury, yet with a most strict admonition, that neither he or any other should presume to come any more upon the same message, lest any of the Inhabitants fidelities might be endangered to be corrupted. Farezius , you may be sure, was not well satisfied with the success of this employment; and the rather, for that as he was afraid to venture upon any dangerous and desperate attempt, in regard he had already sufficiently tryed the valour and resolutions of his Enemies; so was he not able, before he should receive new supplies from the Senate , to besiege the Town round about, whereby to hinder us from all provision: These considerations caused him for some time to labour the invention of many designs, as well in his own private thoughts, as by the advice and counsel of his friends: one while he had a minde absolutely to give over the siege, as conceiving it not onely to be a work of extraordinary difficulty, but in a manner appeared to be destructive to his other purposes, both in the settling of the affairs of the Kingdom, according to his own imaginary desire, as also in regard of the protraction and tediousness of the War, that probably would, as he apprehended, weary the expectations of all his friends: besides, he considered the dangerous consequences it might produce in the belief of the multitude, who formerly seemed to be carried on to his assistance by the opinion of his fortune and valour, that never yet failed to the outward view of the people, either against the King himself, or any of. his greatest Generals: Of the other side he doubted, if he should now desist from his already undertaken attempt, he might thereby, not onely render his enemies much more insolent in their thoughts and proceedings, (by whose example the other parts of Lydia , now as it were standing at a gaze, would be encouraged) but also would bring him in lesse estimation with the Senate , where he was assured many were very inclinable to destroy his designs. These perplexities, I say, detained the thoughts of Farezius for many dayes, still expecting those supplies which had been so long promised him, without any certain resolution, untill at last he became informed of a project, that seemed to appear probable enough in his apprehension. He was advertised, that not far from his Camp Leonides had a brave Castle, not more strongly seated by Nature, then fortified by the entire affections of his Friends and Tennants, that had their habitations within the circumference of that commodious jurisdiction; thither were retired, for their supposed better security, his Wife and her onely Son, attended by some few servants of their numerous family: The Childe exceeded not the age of thirteen, whose years gave him not sufficient strength and conveniency, in his mothers opinion, as yet to accompany his Father in the wars; wherefore being directed by a commission from Leonides , before he entred upon his present employment, to remain under the tuition of his vertuous and indulgent Lady, they both were kept there safe, by the strong guard of their own innocency, as they thought, since almost no tyranny ever prejudiced the right of women and children, notwithstanding any actions of their parents and husbands: But it should seem that Maxime could not be a sufficient protection against ends and interest: For the General finding, that neither his power or violence were able yet to work any thing upon the courage and constancy of Leonides , was induced to try another stratagem, which was forthwith to seize upon the person of the Boy; and when he had him in his power, either to make him a sacrifice to his own spleen, or a means to reduce his Fathers spirit, whereby to entertain such conditions, as were most convenient for his purposes: To this effect, he called unto him a Troop of Horse, upon whose valours and fidelity he chiefly relyed, in all matters of greatest trust and difficulty, unto whom he gave a strict charge, presently to put in execution this design, with as much privacy and industry as possibly they could. The Souldiers, when they had received these orders and commands, from the mouth and directions of their almost never contradicted General, they hasted in the night season to the mentioned Castle, where first placing a convenient guard round about the walls, when it was morning, the chief Commander with half a score of his best Troopers well armed, entred the House, the Lady her self at that instant being employed, according to her custom, in her early Devotions: after he had set a Sentinel upon the door where the wife of Leonides remained, because he would not be interrupted, either by her cries or resistance, he made a strict search himself in person for the childe; at last he found him in his bed, sleeping with so sweet an innocency, as might have in some sort deterred the execution, if the peremptoriness of his injunction, had not overawed both his nature and his pitty: But that being belike a more powerful spell to his thoughts and disposition, then any other apprehension, he caused him quickly to be clothed; which being performed, as if haste had been his business, though cruelty was the design, he issued out of the Castle, who was followed by the loud exclamations of many of the inferiour servants, as being the best defence, their Loyalties could for that time afford their absent Lord and Master. Farezius , as I may say, thus presented with this most acceptable rape, after he had with something a chearful countenance, well considered the beauty of the Boy, lifting up his eyes to the Heavens, as if a little he demanded pardon for his attempt, and by some discourses had a while pleased his apprehension with the childes witty replies, he gave present order, to have a Scaffold erected upon a Mount, in the full view and sight of the City: whilst every one seemed in a manner to be confounded, with the expectation of the intention and event, he called a certain Souldier of the Army unto him, whom he sent presently to Leonides his Father, not onely to signifie unto his consideration, the dolefulness of that spectacle ready prepared for a sacrifice, but to wish him to take it into his choice, whether he would behold the death of his dear and onely Son, or willingly deliver the Town under his command, upon reasonable and honourable conditions: And afterward if he pleased, either go home, and enjoy the possessions quietly of his own estate and fortunes, with the comfort and consolation of his beloved wife and family, or obtain what employment he should desire in the Senates Army. Before this dismal messenger could make his return, the Lady Salona , wife to Leonides , (as it were transported even to distraction, with all the several passions, that are accustomed to wait upon love, grief, compassion, and the sense of so great a loss) her self in person arrived in the Camp; where being no sooner come, but she was presently informed, of the unfortunate fate almost determined of her most beloved Son: so that she flew, rather then went, with violence to the feet of the General, accompanied by such circumstances of tears, sighs, and such other acclamations, as her lamentable condition conceived necessary, for the obtaining of her request: Farezius , whose Decrees for the most part were irrevocable, esteeming it a kinde of a sin against his Honour, to appear perswaded in matters of consequence, either by pity or importunity, after she had made her desire known, though more by her pale looks and distempered languge, then by her words or discourses, the General told her, that as her suit remained in her own Husbands breast to determine, so could not he himself give any positive answer to her demand, untill the messenger he had sent to know her Lords minde, were returned with his determinate reply: In the interim , he wished her to repose her self, with as much patience and quiet as she could to her trembling thoughts, since the contrary, as he said, would be of no value at all to her cause. Within an hours time, or thereabouts, the Messenger returned, not onely with the Governours flat and peremptory denial, but also told his Lord and Master, that Leonides , said he, had rather be his own childs executioner, then suffer him to live, either to be a stain to his honour, or much less a means to break those sacred tyes of fidelity, he had contracted with his Friends and Countreymen, in that service of Loyalty to his Prince. This resolute Answer of Leonides you may imagine, did neither please or satisfie the greedy expectation of Farezius : Of the other side, poor Salona was wholly overcome by her own prevailing passions; for as she knew her Husband to be most wilfully constant in all the decorums, that belonged to those points of Honour he had once conceived in his thoughts, so did she very probably suppose, that Farezius could not by what means soever, be withdrawn from putting in execution, those determinations he had at any time absolutely resolved in his minde. With these apprehensions she quickly sunk down to the ground before the company, giving out such a screek, as if the whole world had been concerned in the occasions of her grief: This caused some of the assembly presently to haste to her relief; but however the assistance brought her again out of her swoon, yet when she was come to her self, and had rested in a chair for some short time, she began to make a new War with her fair hair though no way to be esteemed criminal, if not at the first, in perswading those dear affections from her Husband, that had produced at present the subject of all her sorrow: Having necessarily reposed her self, as I said, after the General had by a few complemental (rather then comfortable words) endeavoured to settle her attentiveness, in a kinde of a formal gravity, mith a most slow expression, as if his words had been afraid to trespass upon each other by his over-much haste, he uttered himself in this manner. Lady, said he , although I have just cause to be offended with the obstinacy of your Husband, not onely for the much blood that hath been shed (and more is like to be by his peevish wilfulness) but also in regard, that this protraction doth retard in a manner all my other imployments; yet to let you see how much my gentleness doth exceed his want of pitty (when he is so far from considering the condition of your onely Son, that he seemeth scarce to remember that he hath a Wife living, with whom he had so much wealth, beauty, and honour) I shall for one day longer reprieve the life of your beloved Childe, to try if those sorrowful tears of yours, can yet work any effect upon his harsh and uncompassionate nature, when as for a few circumstances of blasted honour (called the restoration of his King) he can suffer his Son, to be cast away in the flower (or I may say rather) in the very blossom of his years: To this purpose I grant you a Commission, not onely to go into the Town, but do most religiously promise, not to suffer that doleful Tragedy to be acted, until you either bring or send his determination; provided the time be no longer than to morrow at noon protracted, lest the omission prove no less a forfeiture then your Childes life. Although this rigorous mercy, seemed little less to many then an unexampled cruelty, yet Salona , when she rather expected a present execution, then any favour at all, it sounded to her ears, as from some Divine Oracle pronounced, since her desperate despair had reduced her thoughts to nothing but horrid imaginations, full of black and fearful objects: Wherefore with a humility, that could not but satisfie the highest pride upon earth, she cast her self again at his feet, with such a profession of thanks, as might well have purchased her Sons life, over and above the grace granted, if Faxezius ends had not much gone beyond all the rules of good nature and compassion: The sorrowful Lady with many hopes, but more fears, proceeded to the Town, where being presently brought to the presence of her cruel, though honourable husband (as she conceived) without many circumstances, but what tears and sighs first ushered in, she saluted him with this language. Alas, alas, my Lord, said she , have we altogether forgot nature that formed us, and morality that should render our conversations humane? can all those multitude of vows made at our unfortunate marriage, be so easily broken without any apprehension, onely coloured by pretences of Loyalty and Allegiance? Cannot Euarchus Crown be maintained by his friends, without acts of horrour shewed to themselves? What sacrifices will next succeed to the amazed world, when parents shall comply in those slaughters, which the worst of Furies can scarce endure to behold? Are these the sweet comforts of our dear embracements, when the chief fruits of our chaste endeavours, shall be destroyed by our selves? For ever henceforward let all those Nuptial rights be accursed, that produce any thing else but barrenness to the world, since the usual effects belonging to those Ceremonies, are cast off from our affection, without any consideration or pitty? What may my aged Parents think of their Daughters fortunes, that promised so much felicity to their years, when they joyfully assisted at our Nuptials, since she had not so much interest with her unkinde Husband, as to procure but his consent, to the saving of that onely Son, in whom was to be continued the very honour and succession of the Family: To what madness do passions flye in this age, when we leave off the common way of Justice and Humanity, as I may say wilfully destroying that which we most desire to conserve, onely because with too much violence we seek to conserve it? But Leonides if you will needs for your glory shew your self the worst of tyrants, at leastwise begin the Tragedy with your ever loving and obedient Wife; and by that act you will become something more merciful, for that she shall not be obliged to behold, not onely her Son slaughtered, but slaughtered by the endeavours of his own Father: 'Tis most certain that Farezius doth shew himself a great deal less cruel, in prosecuting the death of his estnemed enemies, then Leonides who becomes the unrelenting destroyer of his chiefest friends; for he would have our Son live, when the Father is most violent to have him dye: No, no, do not flatter your self with these fond conceits of Honour and Loyalty, when this very act of yours in future times, will be sufficient to destroy that opinion, which you think should make you famous to after ages. Let it suffice to the judgement of all understanding, at leastwise good men, that where a Prince hath not power to protect, the Subject hath no obligation to obey: neither can we be more tyed to our friends, then to perform those things we ought concerning our selves. With these words she began to return with a new violence upon her self, in so uncompassionate a manner, that as the company had labour enough to hinder her from those cruelties upon her own person, so did the attempt again more then torment, the already too much wounded soul of poor Leonides ; but at last after he had something pacified the furious passions of his most dearly beloved Wife; as I may say by the help of sighs, tears, and other sad and doleful expressions, which had been of power to have banished for ever all content from the face of the earth, at last he forced from his tongue this language. O! until now never unwelcome, most dear Salona , since the satisfaction of thy importunity, can require no less a price than the dishonour, not onely of thy unfortunate Husband, but of our noble Family for ever: O let not thy fair soul be tainted with the golden baits of fallacy and deceit; so far as to believe a little life preserved in thy Son, ought to be esteemed before the eternal memory of him, that should be more in thy thoughts then all other humane considerations whatsoever! 'Tis true, I must confess, our childe like a young blossom cropt before its time, cannot but bring at present some amazement to our apprehensions; yet when that beautiful flower of honour hath once shed its vertue, O never, never will it grow again to our advantage: At the worst, bright Epitaphs in golden Letters will shew to all people what we were, that not onely contended, but overcame our fortunes in these difficulties; wherefore again, dear Salona , let not any black cloud of infamy, darken thy many eminent vertues, which I would have still conquerours over all humane obstacles, both for thy own sake and mine. Fame, fame, is that must make us both live eternally, when as Children oftentimes in this life prove but scourges to our thoughts, and afterward an ignominy to themselves: The greatest conflict at present is, to put off so much of indulgent sense, that causeth thee more to desire thy childe, then to love him, since his innocency cannot but carry him to a better place, which thou wouldest apparently endanger, onely to please thy own appetite; and certainly such a perdition the immortal Gods would require at thy hands: besides consider, that his years cannot still continue at the same stay; for although now thou hast him absolutely under thy own jurisdiction, yet it will not be long before others possess more of him then thy self, perhaps being tired with thy over much indulgency: Certainly his inconstant youth, will begin every day more then other, rather to look at his own pleasures then to think of thy satisfaction; and perhaps with so little gratitude to thy regard, notwithstanding all thy love and care, that unconcerned persons in his prosperity, will be likelier to prevail with his thoughts and opinion, then any wise and affectionate documents can proceed either from nature or obligation: At the best thou must not hope but to hear of his happiness a far off, since the various accidents of youthful imployments will destroy those fruitions, which nearer cannot be had, without some injury to Childrens education, in regard that action and varieties, are the best means to procure fame and reputation to youth and nobility: Therefore I say; if our Son dye upon this glorious occasion, (considering as I have already remembred the many chances and hazzards of this life) we have all our ends; he in being secured by reason of his innocency under the Gods protection, for which onely we brought him forth; and we in having so happily preserved our own fame, against all the obstacles this world could produce, as enemies to our constancy. Let these considerations I beseech thee quiet thy thoughts, concerning the worst of ills that can befall us in this conflict; if better happen to our lot then we expect, we are beholding to our selves for a double victory, not onely in overcoming, but in enjoying; for Children are but living pictures, that continue our memories no longer then they are good to our benefit; but Fame once purchased by our deserts, can never be lost either from us or the world. Leonides although he had delivered thus much to his Wife, accompanied by such a look, as demanded a consent and not a reply; yet finding his rhetorick could not prevail with her settled passion, he presently took her in his armes; when after he had, as I may say, a little smothered her grief by his many loving kisses, that seemed again to renew their old affections, that appeared to be something separated by these cruel and unfortunate disasters, he conjured her to rest satisfied until the next day, which was the time, as he said, limited by Farezius mercy: When he had conducted her for her more conveniency into his Bed-Chamber, leaving her there carefully to be observed by her attendants, lest her violent grief might procure some unfortunate accidents to her person, he pretended he had necessary offices to perform amongst his Commanders, that tended to the security of her Son; which being said, he retired into another room, where sending for some few of his most confident and valiant friends of the Army, as soon as his tears and sighs would give him leave, he uttered these words. Gentlemen, said he , if the Gods themselves had sent messengers, to have commanded me to have retracted from my former resolutions, or that the blackest furies of Hell had endeavoured by what exquisite torments soever, to have forced me from that truth and faith, which I owe to your braveries, these provocations had been nothing, in comparison of my Wives doleful importunities: This being considered, I cannot but by the same rules of justice and compassion, wish you to reflect at present upon my unfortunate condition, that must either forego that which I esteem most dear unto me in this world, or hazzard the breach of those ties of obligation, that binde me inviolably to your observation: Of the one side nature calls me to the bar of humanity, to be tryed by love, pitty, and affection: Of the other side honour, fame, and ambition tell me, I can neither be glorious or faithful, if I yield to those base appetites, that destroy worth and future remembrance: If I should suffer my poor Childe to be destroyed by the Generals spleen, when I had the power and opportunity to prevent the mischief, not onely the tears and execrations of my whole Family, would undoubtedly persecute my quiet all the dayes of my life; but my dear Wife the very comfort and companion of my hopes, might be indangered her self to pay the cruel forfeitures of my omissions, as an innocent sacrifice for my obstinate perseverance, since as you see both her complaints and passions, are not to be pacified by any perswasion I can use: Consider therefore dear friends, I say, whether these apprehensions have not power enough to work, if not effects, at leastwise appetites of alteration, almost upon the strongest resolutions, that ever the earth produced for example; for you see that dreadful spectacle already prepared before my view, intended as the last period of my happiness, since thereby my Son will not onely be destroyed, but my Wife shall still remain unpacified to her own torment, and my eternal discontent; and as it were ever upbraiding my cruelty both with her looks and sighs, for depriving her of that inestimable Jewel, not again to be redeemed to her thoughts by the earths endeavour: With what Courtship think you, can I more entertain her Father, Mother, or other Friends, after this wilful neglect? when it was in my power to have preserved if I had pleased, her beloved interest as well as mine: If we should again return home to my own house with victory and triumph it will be thought the purchase was bought at much too dear a rate, when not onely my own blood and yours have been spilt in the service, but an innocent sacrifice offered to the onely opinion of fame, which ambition would needs have continued in after ages, though none of us I am certain shall any thing at all value it after our deaths; though these conceits now, make us more then contend against nature and compassion: Gentlemen I tell you, I expect to be looked upon like some horrid creature, contracting nothing but eyes of wonder and reproof, since the world is more apt to desire, the effecting of those actions that are moral and compassionate, then to give praise and commendation to heroical accomplishments of strange natures; but not to detain you too long, when protraction cannot but prove the worst mischief, be assured, that notwithstanding all those provocations, I have resolved to continue constant in my purposes, as well for my own honour as your safeties, rather chusing to bury the remembrance of Wife, Son, and Parents in a perpetual obscurity, then any wayes falsifie those holy bonds of contract, that first united both our affections and endeavours in this imployment: nevertheless, give me leave not onely to say, but to determine, as I am Husband, Father, and Childe, to attempt something with honour, before I go from all these interests, that may either redeem my Sons life, or venture the loss of my own, to render people better satisfied, as well in my nature as of my courage: To this purpose if you please to become my valiant companions in my designs, since I have and ever will be yours by obligation, I make no doubt (protected by the Gods assistance) but either gloriously to sacrifice our lives to the enemies disadvantage, or finish such an adventure, as probably will restore my Son to his Mothers possession; which in effect is thus shortly to be conceived. You know (said he) according to those several informations we have had from our Spies, that when the General had again retired my Son from before the Scaffold (as it may be supposed) whilst his Mother had made a new way for my dishonour, he caused him presently to be sent to a small Fort, not very well guarded near the walls of the Town, being confident enough (as it should seem) of his own power and my inconstancy. In short, if we can by valour, stratagem, or both, surprize the place, you will not onely by his redemption, purchase a happiness of an unvaluable nature to me and my whole Family, never to be forgotten by us or Posterity, but thereby we shall also free this poor Town, from such an incumbrance, as will make it capable to hold out for a continued and lasting siege, since already as you see, they have obstructed much of our provision: This being said, he crost his armes, and cast his looks upon the ground, as if his grief had made him seek something at their hands, that neither his modesty, nor their loves should have attempted. But they, whose hearts were already on fire, with compassion, affection, and courage, received these intimations, like dryed tinder, the greatest sparkle could be produced; in demonstration of which, they not onely promised a faithful performance, of what design soever he should either propose or execute, but suddenly rose all from their places with their Swords drawn, as an infallible testimony of their constant resolutions in his behalf: Neither did they much dispute the probabilities of the attempt, in regard the season would not afford so much conveniency: Onely I may say, that night they issued out of Town, fortified with invincible bravery in their thoughts, which sufficiently foretold good fortune to their actions, insomuch as before day by a small slaughter of some few of the guard, they surprized the Fort, and presented the Childe as a most precious Jewel, near lost, to his almost dead Mother Salona . Salona , after she had with amazed looks for a long season beheld this miracle of Heaven, as she believed, rather then a special blessing sent her by the Gods, since she could not hope, much less expect such a ravishing comfort, to fall so suddenly upon all her sorrows and misfortunes, in a kinde of a transported extasie uttered these words. And art thou safely returned sweet Astianax, after all my torments and despairs? or rather is't my flattering fancy, that would delude my weak senses, with a seeming happiness that my reason cannot any way hope for? O you Gods, said she, with what an infinite goodness are you perswaded, to pleasure mortal and sinful creatures, when as their want and trust of confidence in your mercy and bounty, rather deserves a continuation and increase of your worst rigour, then any limitation or end of their miseries. With this she took her dear Son in her loving arms, where with multitudes of kisses she endeavoured to imprint upon his fair lips, the truest characters of a Mothers violent affections, until at last, as it were tyred with these extraordinary expressions, she again silently with many joyful tears bathed his lovely cheeks all over, having not words sufficiently to express her inward content and felicity: But whilst these natural passions imployed Salona , who seemed neither to reflect upon the manner of her Sons delivery, much less took any notice of the persons present, that had been gallant actors in so noble a design; the rest of the Commanders of the Army, who had not been made privy to the project, (for that all could not be instruments in the attempt) enter'd her Chamber with something dejected countenances: These also were at last perswaded, by many strong reasons (instead of other excuses) to be not onely pacified in their apprehensions, concerning their Governours intentions, but withal to become extream charitable in their opinions, both of him and his affections towards their particulars, considering it was unpossible all could be imployed in a business of such an nature; for that the Town must needs have been left unguarded, and by that means exposed to dangerous consequences, if the plot, should not have succeeded according to the intention: Leonides seeing his Wife, could not be brought off from her settled contemplations, concerning her Sons delivery, whereby to bestow some few ceremonial complements upon those Gentlemen his friends, that had engaged themselves in the service, he performed the office himself. Then leaving Salona his Wife uninterrupted in her transported contemplations, which he perceived gave work enough to her and her feminine attendants, he made haste to those Councels, that were most proper for his charge. To conclude, I finding a proper season for my departure, in regard that this accident had removed the enemy farther from the walls, I made a shift by the procurement of this disguise, not onely to get free from that place where I was besieged, but also as you see to be admitted to this present conference, onely I may fear, lest the tediousness of my relation, may prove some inconveniency to your health, both in regard of the place and the time of the night: But Roxana returned him answer of thanks instead of other expostulations; withal she told him, that as she intended, to make the Princess and her Brother in the morning acquainted with these passages, so must she desire him the next night following again to repair to the same station, whereby she might inform him, what they resolved upon in each particular, concerning those things himself had related. In the morning Roxana went to the Chamber of the Princess, but finding her asleep she retired presently to her own rest, however scarce had she reposed for a quarter of an hour, but a messenger in all haste brought her word, that not onely the Princess was now awake, who most earnestly had enquired after her, but also gave her notice, that her Brother Ascanius was newly come to visit her: These were sufficient Items to cause Roxana to make haste to her presence: for as she knew the morning would be the best time for their conference, so was she very well acquainted with the impatiency of the Princesses nature, in those things that either concerned the Kings affairs, or her own loves: After she entered the room, and with something a chearful though grave countenance had saluted them both, she rested silent, knowing they would be both eager enough to enquire after her adventures? Cloria and Ascanius lookt one upon another, as if they expected who should begin to put her into her discourse: In fine, Roxana quickly informed them of these particulars Mercuris had delivered. When she had absolutely finished her relation, she found such passions in the young Prince, for his suddain departure, whereby to be in person the sooner in the Wars, or other imployments; that scarce did he allow himself patience enough, any way to consider the best way and means for his escape: Sometimes he seemed as if he would presently leap violently from the leads into the Castle ditch for the more haste; other whiles again, he made resemblance, as if in that habit, he could easily pass through the guard undiscovered, without either trouble or danger to himself or others: And lastly, he thought upon his former intention, which was as a watermans youth, to free his person absolutely from his confinement. These are the passions, that for the most part belong to the thoughts and actions of unexperienced age, before their appetites are a little bridled by counsel and subjection: Wherefore Roxana , as she had by her often prescribed rules, brought her own Mistrisse the Princesse Cloria , into a convenient temper, of hearing her advice upon all occasions; or at leastwise her many uncertain changes and desperate adventures, had rendred her nature and disposition pliable in that kinde, for that tedious sufferings not seldom overcome the greatest inflamations, either of youth or courage; so began she with something a sad gravity, to reprove Ascanius over hasty precipitation, before they had (as she said) not onely considered of the means, but of the thing it self which was to be effected; and the rather did she urge this, because he seemed now to go from his former resolutions, which was to seek imployment in the revolted Ships, that immediately and properly belonged to the King his Fathers affairs; whereas the Wars of Syria onely appertained to the right and interest of strangers, that appeared for the present to have little affinity with the concernments of the Kingdom of Lydia : Her admonition, or rather may I call it a wise and judicious warning, in regard it seemed a little below the condition of a great Prince, having also a probable share in the inheritance of the Crown, to venture his person as a Voluntier in another Countrey; where at the best, onely some small personal honour might be got, especially when as his own Fathers quarrel being in question, was to be maintained by the power and valour of the whole Royal Family, gave some stop at the instant to those hot imaginations, that upon the report without other consideration, had inflamed his thoughts and desires to this new enterprize: Yet considering that as it would be some shame to his youth, to lie still in any place without action, whilst the world was in trouble, she held it convenient enough in the general; he should think upon his departure; leaving notwithstanding in the interim his future imployment, to the advice and dispose of his Mother Queen, when he should himself be arrived in the Kingdom of Syria ; and the rather for that that speedy journey was prescribed him, by her own particular command and direction: Although these resolutions were quickly agreed upon, yet poor Cloria could not be but something discontented at the necessity that caused them; since by this means ere long she was assured, to be deprived of her chief comfort and best delight, the sweet conversation of her most dear Brother, who was made much more dearer, by reason of their last particular and familiar acquaintance: but yet wisdom and obedience after a few tears in the Princess, overcame all those unruly though natural passions, that are accustomed oftentimes in other people, to destroy honour and hinder opportunity; so that her self at last, was won also absolutely to the complyance: In the next place therefore it was to be considered, how that young Ascanius might free his person conveniently from the dominion of the Castle: Roxana as she had the prerogative in age, so most commonly had she it in advice. Either (said she) we must use some means to corrupt the Sentinels, that are appointed day and night to attend about our lodgings, under whose conduct by some neat and convenient disguise, the Prince may easily pass through the other guards of the Castle, and by consequence get out of the farthermost gates without any suspicion at all, or else we must endeavour by some stratagem or other, to make passage for him out of the windows of our Chambers, or else descend him down gently, from the battlements of the high Tower, that belongs to our lodgings, by an artificial ladder made of cords, contrived together to that purpose; onely the greatest difficulty will be, by what industry we shall be able to procure these materials, since you know no stranger whatsoever, is admitted to have the least conference with any of our faction and interest, unless some eminent Commander or Officer of the Castle he present: This necessity would destroy the principal part of our project, if we had not another remedy in store to mend up this defect, which is to make use of the assistance of my Lord Ascanius his servant, who may without any difficulty provide those things we want, either in habit, disguise, or other materials, according as I shall give him from time to time instructions in our nightly communications at the water-gate, the place designed as you know for our rendezvous and meetings upon all occasions. As it was not to be doubted, but that Ascanius and his Sister were sufficiently satisfied in their opinions, concerning the weight of her projects, agreeing so aptly with their reasons and apprehension; so of the other side they thought it best, to make election of the last design, since the corrupting of their guards seemed to be an enterprize of much more hazzard and difficulty to bring about: And failing therein the person of the Princess Cloria , was not onely in danger to be much harder used in her confinement, being suffered now to walk in the Gardens, and other places of pleasure within the Castle; but her Brother Ascanius might also thereby come to be discovered, whereby his life very probably might be brought in question: After the whole plot was agreed upon in the general, the managing of the business being onely left to the discreet care of Roxana , who that night, as had been appointed between them, was to meet Mercurio in the old place, Ascanius with a great deal of seeming joy in his countenance, took his leave of his Sisters Chamber, according to his custome, to follow some youthful recreations that delighted his nature, although his habit and womans attire gave him scarce any conveniency answerable to his wishes; for that he found himself not onely confined to a Gallery or a Garden at the most, but durst not for fear of discovery by the suspicious apprehension of the Souldiers, use those manly exercises his thoughts desired, or might have done, if he had been absolutely freed from those impediments. The Princess Cloria of the other side, remaining behinde, onely with her Governess in the Chamber, began a little to reflect upon the loss of her Brothers company; and this brought again into her remembrance thoughts of her absent Narcissus , which Ascanius conversation had hitherunto a little diverted from her settled imagination, in regard of that content she possessed by the continual company of him, in whose person was also a world of innocency and beauty: From remembrance she went to considerations; and from considerations, she proceeded to discourse; and none being present but Roxana , to her alone she used this language. Roxana , said she, I prethee tell me, what is the reason, since Narcissus hath so fortunately settled his affairs in the Island of Cyprus , according to the relation of Mercuris , he neither seeks to imploy his power and prosperity, towards the redemption of my Fathers crown, or so much as sends any messenger, particularly to enquire of my concernments? which perhaps jealous lovers (though I am none of the number) would be apt to interpret after something an evil and untoward sense: Nevertheless, I must conclude, the least obligation he owes me for this charitable favour, in the construction of his actions and intentions is, that he, or some body for him, ought to render me as satisfied as may be in these mentioned particulars: Roxana quickly found what apprehensions the Princess began to ingender in her bosom, which she doubted would increase upon her Brothers departure, since imprisonment and melancholly, are proper and fit instruments to produce and nourish discontents? Wherefore in the first place she reproved her discourses, as if they tended to the same injustice concerning Narcissus , and his proceedings, as formerly she had forewarned her of in particular, since Mercuris their messenger (as she said) had not onely lately been with him in the Island of Cyprus , but had received a special Commission from his own mouth, to treat with the Queen Hyacinthia in the Kingdom of Syria , about her self and the affairs of Lydia: In the next place, she answered all her short and unvaluable arguments with these reasons; As it is most erroneous, said she, and utterly against the honour and dignity of your loves (that should be pure and without suspicion) to ground consequences, upon not performing those things onely, your fancy perswades you might easily be done, since it is very probable Narcissus present ocasions, in the grand Treaty between the State of Cyprus and the King of Egypt , joyned with the close restriction of your own new confinement, within the narrower circumference of this Castle, being debarred from all access without the privity of the Senate, are arguments sufficient in that nature, to confound all your doubts and fears, if you retain still with your unfortunate imprisonment, your wonted goodness and wisdome: Besides, you may very well believe that the present distempers, if not rebellions, newly risen, and now in hot agitation in the Kingdom of Syria , must of necessity protract all his designs to that purpose, since you know he must run hand in hand with that State, to work any considerable advantage to the affairs of your Father or your self; for that as you cannot imagine his power to be omnipotent, and the less for ought I know may it be with his own people, if the peace intended succeed between the King of Egypt and the Countrey of Cyprus , so the Subjects no doubt upon all occasions will be apt enough, to raise and maintain factions against his power and jurisdiction, knowing him to be absolutely addicted to the interest and prosperity of the Syrian Nation, in regard of the courtesies his Noble Family hath received from that State: All these things being considered, said she, I must conjure you in your Brother's absence, to leave off all these melancholly and unprofitable apprehensions, in thinking that the Duke of Cyprus will not upon all occasions, do what he can for your service, though it be to the sacrificing his Life and Estate freely to that effect; however for the present, he may be imployed beyond his power, to put them in execution as he would: For the contrary of this resolution in your particular, will so distract our Councels, as well for the future as in the present, that we shall neither have hearts nor courages, to expect the event of those things we have already designed. These words pretty well satisfied the Princess, since as she conceived it was uppossible according to the nature and strictness of her confinement, either for Narcissus to send to her, or she to understand what he intended, but meerly by such accidents as had made Roxana and Mercuris finde out a new way, for their private and concealed conference; so did she resolve in the future as much as lay in her power, to qualifie her own discontent, whereby she might upon all occasions, be rendred more capable to work her self out of those inconveniences, that at present detained her, not onely a captive to her own Fortunes, but to her Fathers Subjects; which notwithstanding she was the better able to bear, in regard of the continuance of her crosses, that in a manner had made them customary to her nature, amongst which number, at the instant, she esteemed the departure of her young Brother to be one of the greatest, whose delightful conversation lately, as I said, had much revived her tired spirits. In the interim, Roxana was not unmindful, at the appointed time again to repair to the grate, where meeting with Mercuris , she made him acquainted with their determinations in every necessary particular for the designs intended by Ascanius: Mercuris told her that the occasion and opportunity at the present, presented themselves very happily for their purpose; for being that day in the afternoon, walking alone upon the Wharf before the Castle, a Boat-man belonging to the City of Sardis , finding him in Mariners apparel, desired to know whether or no he wanted any imployment in that manner of service, since, as he said, some of his people in his own Vessel being newly dead, and he of necessity was speedily to go into the Island of Cyprus , to fetch home some commodities, that were lately come from the Kingdom of Syria , because the Lydiani durst not freely traffick in that Countrey, he was altogether at the instant unprovided of people to govern his Boat: and the rather, as he intimated, for that the revolted Ships from under the Senates jurisdiction, had carried away with them many able Sea-men. As I was very glad, said Mercuris of this occasion for two reasons; the one for my own convenient transportation, if need shall require; the other, left being unentertained in some imployment, I might probably become a suspected person, so have I in a sort made a bargain with the Boat-man, to be ready for his service within a weeks warning: If you be pleased to impart thus much, to my Lord Ascanius , and the Princess his Sister, I shall not fail to provide those commodities you mention for his escape, which joyned with the opportunity I have related, of being transported into the Island of Cyprus , from whence he may conveniently take his journey to any other place he shall please, I hope may give sufficient satisfaction to his youthful-thoughts. Roxana took not much more time to complement with Mercuris , since she conceived the chief part of her business was already dispatched to her contentment: so that presently taking her leave of him, she went to her own Chamber, with an intention the next day to make the young couple acquainted with that nights imployment. In the morning she came into the Chamber of the Princess, where presently beginning to tell her story, she became interrupted a little by Ascanius entry, who as it should seem something impatient of the old womans expected intelligence, was come to visit his Sister before his accustomed time. This occasion forced her anew to begin her relation: She had no sooner ended her discontse, but Ascanius , as if he had been transported with another joy at the very apprehension of the success, before any thing at all towards it was effected, that of a sudden he began to leap about the room; which gave some encouragement to that small company, to spend a few hours in jovialty, and other pretty impertinencies: Ascanius in regard of his journey, and the Princess, for that she doubted not but her young Brother, would in the Island of Cyprus enquire after the concernments of her dear love Narcissus: Neither was Roxana her self wanting in the pastime, the better to content them both. These contented apprehensions at last carried them all into the Garden, for their better recreation, where they remained until the time of the day also called them to dinner, where in the interim, the old woman attended her Mistriss, with a countenance, that shewed her minde was (notwithstanding those outward services) seriously busied about the projects and designs were then in agitation. In a weeks space all things were fitted for the execution of the project. Ascanius ready to be apparelled in his Ship-youths habit, the cords for ladders provided, and Roxana had prepared the window in her Chamber, out of which by her industry she had newly taken an iron bar, whereby the better to give the Prince passage towards his escape: notwithstanding the worst part yet rested behinde, which was the last parting and separation of the young couple: Poor Cloria offered for two or three dayes together sacrifices in her private Cabinet, for the prosperous success of her Brother in his journey; neither did Narcissus want a most ample share in her Devotions: When the hour about midnight came, that they must needs take their leaves, then, and never before, were the height of passions discovered; since Cloria had neither words in her mouth to bid Ascanius farewel, or eyes almost in her head to behold the separation: Nevertheless the young Prince, with a certain kinde of quick haste, after he had once or twice kist his Sister, and saluted also Roxana with some few short complements, in a nimble manner went out of the window upon the ladder; the end thereof being fastned to a strong hook in the Chamber; and so by degrees without overmuch difficulty descended into the Castle Ditch, where he found his trusty servant Mercuris , already with some impatiency expecting his arrival; in whose armes being received, and notice given by a sign to Cloria and Roxana , of the success of the enterprize, both Ascanius and Mercuris took their way instantly towards a private lodging in the outtermost part of the City: however that night they imployed their time onely in watching, for fear of some unfortunate discovery. The next day, early in the morning, Mercuris went to enquire out the Boat- man, and finding him according to his expectation upon the Wharf, he told him, he was not onely come himself to fulfil his promise, whereby to render him the best service both his person and ability would give him leave, but also intended to present him with a small youth of the same profession, for whose truth and diligence he would venture his credit, if he liked his growth and countenance, being a near Kinsman of his own: Nevertheless he let him know also, if his occasions could not afford the conveniency for the youths admittance, he should onely desire the commodity for his transportation into the Island of Cyprus , because he was resolved otherwise there to binde him prentice to the trade, who in the interim should be ready to perform such services, as would be necessary to the Vessel in lieu of his passage: The Sea- man presently told him, that not onely himself, but his companion or young Kinsman, should be heartily welcome to any accommodation his poor Ship could afford them; but more especially if they would resolve to be serviceable upon reasonable terms, in that expedition he was obliged to make to the Island of Cyprus. Mercuris was not backward to promise him any thing for the better advantage of Ascanius , since he was certain upon their arrival, to winde themselves well enough out of what engagement soever he should make with him to that purpose: The news of this contract, Mercuris quickly brought to his young Lord, who most joyfully prepared his thoughts for the time appointed: But after they had been tost upon the Seas at least half a weeks space, the windes not proving very prosperous for their purpose, they were set upon by a ship of much greater strength then their own, not many hours sail off the Island of Cyprus: And being not well able to contend, (though Ascanius strived by all his power, to give some testimonies of his youthful valour) they were at last forced to yield to fortune, and the mercy of their subduers; when presently being put under Hatches, there remained in some perplexity, untill they perceived they were put into some Haven Town, though as yet they could neither be certain of the place, or of the Nation; and so consequently knew not any way how to judge of their fate. It was not long before they were advertised, that they were arrived in the gallant Haven of Sidon , belonging onely to the jurisdiction of Syria: Within a while after they were landed to their no small contentment, since now they assured themselves, they had absolutely escaped all dangers and hazzards, that appertained to the voyage: notwithstanding by these accidents, Ascanius was deprived from performing the desires of his sweet Sister, who at his departure, had obliged him by many promises, to visit her dear Narcissus within the Island of Cyprus ; yet upon this knowledge, they resolved presently before they discovered themselves, to give speedy notice to the Queen Hyacinthia , both of their adventures and abode; which they might the more conveniently do, in regard there parted every day a messenger from that Town to the City of Damascus: Whilst they expected a return of their Letters, there grew a question and debate before the Magistrates of the Haven, between the Boat-man of Lydia , that had brought them from Sardis , and the Captain of the ship, who had taken them prisoners in the passage: Young Ascanius was something pleased with the controversie, who not being detained a strict prisoner, notwithstanding his surprize at Sea, would needs be at the heating of the Cause in the Court of Justice, which particularly belonged to Sea affairs. The Captain alledged, not onely the Ship but the Goods, with the persons of the people, were by the common Law of Nations lawful Prizes to his industry and fortune, and therefore desired not to be deprived of the benefit, in regard of the expence and charge, which he had been at in the prosecution; especially having Letters of Authority from that Town, to seize any Lydian Goods and Vessels, in respect the Merchants had lately received considerable losses, by the Inhabitants of Smyrna in the like manner: The Boat-man of the otherside made answer, that as by no rule of justice he ought to be accomptable for other actions then his own, who had been never an injurer of any in the Town, so of the other side, in regard there yet continued a correspondency between the two Nations, he in particular should not be the sufferer, whereby to make up the defects of other losses; and the rather, for that he could not take any notice of private difference, being there was no publick Decree or Proclamaton to that purpose; the Syrian Officer again to these reasons replied, that however there was no hostility as yet of one Kingdom against the other, whereby all booty whatsoever would be lawful to every subject of either Nation, yet the transportation of many commodities of both, had been forbid by the sound of Trumpet, which had been partly as he said the cause, that gave the first occasion of the Robberies at Sea, from whence proceeded the grounds of those Warrants of Reprisal, himself for the present had, by whose justifiable authority, he was possessed rightfully of the Lydian Vessel, as a forfeiture belonging to the jurisdiction of the State and Priviledges of the Kingdom of Syria , unto which he was a faithful and obedient subject: The other again answered, that he had none of those forbidden commodities in his ship, mentioned in the Proclamation, wherefore in all justice, he was not lyable to incur any forfeiture of his own Goods in that nature: The Syrian upon this answer told the Court, that by all the Rules of right and reason, his adversary had committed a double forfeiture, the one way in regard of the injury his Countrey had done the Merchants of Sidon: The other, for that however he was a natural subject to Euarchus the King, yet he apparently Traded into other Countreys by the Senates authority, who had taken upon them the power of their Kings Right and Prerogative, against his will and pleasure: To these taxations the Lydian Ship-man made this reply, that as he conceived other Nations and Laws ought not to take any notice, much lesse to meddle with Titles and differences of other Kingdoms amongst themselves; so for his part, he did onely endeavour to live peaceable under the power and jurisdiction of them, that had the present Dominion, over both his person and fortunes; and therefore must leave those Rulers to answer for their own actions. Ascanius appeared to be extreamly taken with this curious controversie, having never as it should seem been present at the like before; he would have been glad also to have heard the judgement given, upon those points in difference that were in dispute: But the Magistrates not being willing to determine a business of this nature, without some farther directions from Damascus , in regard it might perhaps touch in the general, the whole Trade and Entercourse of both Nations, they for the present told the parties, they intended, as a matter of some weight, to take a little longer time to consider of the business. But whilst the Judges and the Townsmen were thus busied in their daily consultation concerning this National Right; in the interim both Ascanius and Mercuris having liberty enough to delight themselves with the best curiosities, nature and industry had bestowed upon Sidon , wherein the Temples of the City had a principal share, the chief Governour himself sent unexpectedly for them both: As soon as they came to his presence, he charged them with a suspition, that as they were strangers and something too diligent in observing the fortification of the Town as he understood, so did he think it convenient for the better service of his Master young Orontes , great King of Syria , to examine them concerning their names: Ascanius and Mercuris lookt one upon another, with something distracted countenances, at the suddenness of the surprize; however upon more recollection they might very well conceive, there could be no danger to their persons by that accident, since they remained under so good a protection: it was not long, before the Governour with a gentle smile told them, that he had the Warrant already signed in his pocket for their better imprisonment, and thereupon giving it to Mercuris to read, the paper spake this language.  We understand by our Sister the Queen of Lydia , that our Couzen her Son the young Prince Ascanius , is newly arrived under your jurisdiction, in a disguised habit; Wherefore our pleasure is, that with what expedition you can, you not onely presently take notice of his person, but perform such other services for his better entertainment, as may stand with our honour and the dignity of his quality; which being performed according to his conveniency, conveigh him with some Troops of Horse, and other Companies of Foot is our presence, where he may receive farther respects by our selves, as much as the present troubles of the times will permit: Withall take care, to have him furnished with such necessaries for his journey, as become the person of so great a Prince: In the interim suffer the party that transported him over the Seas into our Kingdom of Syria , to depart freely with his ship out of our Dominions, discharged from all molestation whatsoever: Signed at our Court of Damascus: Orontes and Andromida .  Ascanius after this advertisment, had no more colour to conceal his person; wherefore making a short relation to the Governour of all his adventures with some excuse for his concealment, he was presently with all the honour that might be, conducted to the best Lodgings in the Castle, where he remained notwithstanding, some dayes privately in his Chamber without visits, until new Robes and other conveniences were provided for his accommodation: But one day as the Governour was waiting upon him in his Lodging, he was entreated by him, to make some relation, as well of the passages and Government of the Kingdom of Syria , as also of the chief occasion according to his opinion, that produced the present troubles at Damascus , and elsewhere in the Countrey: although the Governour was something unwilling to enter upon a subject of this nature, for that he conceived such points might prove dangerous in the general, to persons that held places of command under the State, yet having received so strict an injunction from the Conrt, whereby the Prince might receive satisfaction in every thing, he thought it his duty also in this particular, to comply with his youthful ambition: to which purpose, after some few Complements, that for the most part precede all Discourses of the Syrian Nobility, accompanied by a kinde of natural eloquence incident to that Nation, he delivered himself after this manner. Sir, said he, I see Princes must be obeyed, and happy it is both for them and us, if they desire noble things, as well as command just actions: This injunction being of that nature, I shall neither slubber my Relation with impertinencies, or prophane your innocency with untruths; onely for the more brevity, give me leave to take the rise of my discourse, but from the death of our late King Orsames , who ended his Reign almost with his great Favourite Philostros expiration; at which time all Asia seemed to be involved in a confused War: In this posture our now Queen Andromida took upon her the Government, during the infancy and non-age of her young son Orontes , however to be directed in her affairs by the councel and advice (according to the appointment of her Husband) of Orestes , Brother to Orsames: Condris , another Prince of the Blood , and one Mazarius a stranger, born in the Island of Sycania , whose extraction was not thought at all to equal his wit and experience in State-affairs; yet was the man appointed by wise Philostros , to succeed himself in his Masters Councels: I cannot well inform you how he came first to his abilities, onely report tells us, that being of no great family in his own Countrey, ambition made him seek preferment in other Nations, and his fortunate Fate casting him upon this Kingdom, where he hath not onely arrived to the highest period of command, this state can afford him, but hath also matched all his female kindred, meerly by the opinion of his own greatness, to the best marriages in Syria , both for Riches and Dignity: This in all probability, will give him prosperity and continuance, until the present Government, either alter to a new method, or more powerful interests with our young King, work him out of favour; which I am of belief, may very well happen, not onely in regard that Orontes begins now, by reason of his years, to take upon him more actual jurisdiction within his flourishing and vaste Dominions, being a means, as 'tis thought, to raise his young Companions and Favourites to places of trust and power; but also for that both Orestes and Condris , with many others of the prime Nobility of Syria , have lately declared themselves mortal enemies to the proceedings and greatness of Mazarius , though Andromida our Queen on the contrary, seeks with all violence to maintain his interest and power with her Son. This being the condition of our State, I shall endeavour by degrees, to come unto the prosecution of my story for your better satisfaction; however I should be willing nevertheless, to have as much as may be, these opinions concealed from any but your self, since all prejudgements are dangerous, that are declared by discourse, concerning either the facts or deportments of Favourites. As young Ascanius was violent enough to have the Relation, so of the other side, he appeared not any way backward to give testimonies of his own secresie, concerning what should be delivered for his satisfaction and entertainment; which was a Commission and Warranty of a sufficient extent, to render the Governour both confident and willing to a further prosecution; and this assurance after a few more Complements, brought forth this large discourse. Our Queen Andromida , said he, being as I told you, settled in her absolute (though new) Jurisdiction, according to the will and direction of her most glorious Husband, she began discreetly to consider, not onely how she might best advance the great affairs of the Kingdom, but in what kinde she could most maintain her own power without disturbance; and the rather, for that she well knew, as she was by birth an Egyptian , being that Kings sister, a nation of all others most hated by the Syrians , so were the Nobility of this Countrey in the general extreamly given both to faction and inconstancy; the effects of which as she feared would become upon all occasions increased, in regard of the infancy of her son Orontes , by whose right she onely enjoyed her own possession. To this purpose in the first place she cast in her minde the natures and interests of her Companions; or to say more properly, Over-seers in Government, of which number she found onely Mazarius could be absolutely trusted, as an intimate Councellor in her affairs, in that his birth and forreign extraction afforded scarce any other means for his establishment, but what the entire continuancy of her authority was able to procure; since as his person was subject to be despised by the Nobility and Gentry of our Nation, so in respect of his being another Countrey-man, probably upon all casual accidents he should be very much suspected by the Subjects: And truly I must say, she had no hard labour to compasse this design, for as Orestes was esteemed both inconstant and slothful in his disposition, without almost any ambition whatsoever, either to be employed or govern, so of the other side was Condris aged and covetous; wherefore present ease and continual supplies as she thought, would sufficiently from time to time content them both: Thus by degrees did the Queen, with her new Favourite Mazarius , work the whole managing of affairs into their own secret breasts; or at the farthest did but commit them to a Cabinet-councel of such creatures, which they had absolutely made theirs, by rich benefits or dependency: The rather might they effect these purposes, in regard not onely of the present distempers and troubles of the world, that none knew so well as Mazarius how to compose, by reason of his employments during the life of Philostros , but also, for that most of the Nobility themselves were so envious one against another, that they were not willing any but a meer stranger should have any absolute Interest and Jurisdiction: This the rather, in regard they supposed when they pleased they could easily destroy the power both of Mazarius and the Queen, as not having either sufficient skill or kindred, to maintain their Authority against the least combination of the Kingdom, time enough as they thought, when Orontes the King should approach nearer to his years of Command; which as 'tis said, the Laws of Syria allow him, when his stature may arise in growth, to the heighth of the Royal Sword of the Nation, carried before our Kings commonly in Triumphs: In the next place it was held, not onely convenient, but necessary for the better establishing of the Queens Government, to continue afoot those Wars already begun, although it were against her own Brother, unless he would yield in a manner to contemptible conditions: Her pretence howsoever was, that Orsames before his death had directed the terms of agreement, which could not be well altered (as they said) until our young King Orontes should come to his full years of consent; an obstacle as 'twas supposed, onely put in by such as have the dispose of the Treasure of the Kingdom, whereby they colourably may lay what Taxations they please upon the people for their own advantages: But nevertheless, however the wars went on still with a continued violence, both against Sorastros King of Egypt , and Artaxes great Prince of Armania , yet a general Treaty was agreed to be upon the Confines of eithers Territory, where every concerned party was to appear in person, or by his Deputies, with such claims as his own confidence could any way challenge in particular; there as 'twas given out to be righted if it were possible, by some hopeful and peaceable agreement: But whether this was onely to amuse the people, with thoughts of that which was never intended? Or that the true design was, for the intentional and actual good and settlement of Asia , I cannot say, or will dispute? But so it was, that the wars notwithstanding continuing, the son of Prince Condris was ordained by the Queen (knowing his spirits to be both violent and restless, and therefore not held fit to be too much interested in private Councels at Court) to be great General of all our Armies, that were to be employed either within or without the Kingdom: It cannot be denied, but that he carried himself in these services during his Fathers life, with such judgement, courage, and fidelity, that as his many victories gained as well dominion as honor to the Kingdom of Syria , so did it give (as it should seem) so many causes of jealousie to the Island of Cyprus , concerning the future greatness of our Nation, that notwithstanding all the powerful perswasions of the Duke of Cyprus to the contrary, the people would needs make a peace with the King of Egypt , without the consent and allowance of our State, that until then kept a most firm and strict correspondency with us, as well in matters of peace as war; insomuch, as presently we were constrained to shuffle up another accord with the Countrey of Armenia , not so advantageable for Cassianus , and other pretended injured Princes, as we both promised and intended: But truly Sir, howsoever young Conderosus , the son of old Condris , had purchast as much fame in the hither parts of Asia , as his merits joyned with so few years could possibly expect, yet of a sudden not long after his Fathers death, whose wisdom and temper belike had kept his ambition in some order, he began publickly to quarrel, not onely with the Government of the State, but with the very fashions and conversation of the Court; however for no other reason as it was supposed, but for that Mazarius , seemed to be more eminent by the Queens favour, in steering all affairs of consequence then himself: In his common discourses amongst his Companions, he pretended, that as Mazarius and the Queen were too nearly united in their affections, for the good and prosperity of the Kingdom of Syria , so were their proceeding in that particular extreamly dishonourable to themselves, if not apparantly scandalous to the world, since thereby the birth of the young King after so long a barrenness might come in future times to be both suspected and questioned, perhaps as 'twas said, to the involving of the Kingdom of Syria in a dangerous and lasting civil war; but the wiser sort of people, rather feared his violent ambition, joyned with his nearer pretention to the Crown, (if the Issue Royal now being should fail) were the chief causes of his distempers and presumption; besides he intimated that the Queen and Mazarius being both strangers by birth, might have some designs in their intentions, of some dangerous and pernitious consequences, to the Nobility and Government of Syria , whereby the State in time might come to be betrayed to a forreign power and jurisdiction: And last of all he seemed to complain exceedingly, that the Court-practices being onely given to sports and luxury, the disposition of the young King, was in apparant hazzard to be so adulterated with the enticements of flattery and pleasure, that he would soon cast off from his thoughts, all desire either of action or glory, that in former ages made his noble Ancestors famous in the world: the rather as they said, were these fears to be prevented by the judicious consideration of the Princes of the blood, in that Andromida the Queen, endeavoured to place no persons about her Son, but a few ignorant and fantastical women, or such of her own absolute Creatures, that neither understood honour, or were willing to see the King practise vertue. As I must needs affirm, that these extravagant discourses proceeded onely from the private and ambitious ends of young Conderosus , for his own particular advantage, whereby the better to mount himself into the principal places of Government and Command, (if his thoughts and designs tended not to a worse end, by reason of his blood and extraction) so will I not deny altogether, but that the Queen and Mazarius strived to detain Orontes so much within their own power, and jurisdiction, that scarce could he come to the competent knowledge of any thing within the compass of his own Kingdom, much less the transactions of forreign Princes, but what should be meerly derived from their authority and interest. I must confess his youth is continually to be instructed by gallant and knowing men, in all sorts of Sciences and noble actions, that pretend either to honour or piety; especially for that his natural endowments are capable of the highest perfections art can bestow upon mortality, according to the best knowing judgements of Syria ; however I cannot say, but that he hath sufficient already of these for any Prince living, but certainly he might have much more, if these private maximes of State-policy did not something obstruct the Queens endeavours, being put in the head perhaps, that as in the time of Philostros she was kept rather as a guarded prisoner, then as Wife or Queen to great Orsames King of Syria , so losing her authority over her son, she might quickly return to the same condition again, by the spight and craft of her adversaries: neither wants she the warning example of the old Queen Anaxia , to give her a sufficient taste of her own fate, if she should lose her present Dominion, who in our dayes was so circumvented by her own servant Philostros , that instead of remaining intrusted, and esteemed by her Son Orsames , she was constrained to live a banished person all the dayes of her life; and in her death was not allowed any thing at all to perform convenient Funerals, belonging to the birth and quality of so great a Princess, who was Mother to the mightiest King of all Asia: As this Sir may be thought some disgression from my story, so will I now inform you more to our purposes: Our Queen Andromida conceiving these intimations, if not reall discourses of Conderosus , would in time prove something dangerous to her own quiet, and her sons prosperity, if not carefully prevented, bethought her self, (since as yet she had not ground enough as she believed, to fall out openly with the violent ambition of that young Prince) if possible she could divert the inconveniency and hazzard by some forreign employment answerable to his dignity and quality: To this effect, I say, both she and Mazarius remembred, that much of the Kingdom of Egypt had been lately conquered, either by Orsames fortune, or Philostros policy, with the great and rich City of Memphis , which now again in part began to be recovered by Sorastros , since he was freed in some sort from his Carthaginian troubles; thither she resolved to send Conderosus , both to conquer and command, hoping his Honour could hardly refuse the employment without some disgrace; however, she intended to play with him at that distance, as well oncerning the supplies that were necessarily to be sent after him for his better provision, as for that being personally far from Court, she might have opportunity upon every occasion, to lessen his growing esteem in her own Kingdom: But whether Conderosus before his departure, perceived this stratagem or no, I cannot certainly tell; yet sure I am, that after his arrival upon the confines of Egypt , pretending to act great matters for the Kings service, he found his Forces much too weak, (at leastwise so given out by his own friends and servants) to cope with so great and powerful an Enemy as his Adversary: That when he had remained there for some moneths, perpetually sending in the interim to Court for fresh supplies, at last extreamly discontented to the outward view of the world, he returned before he was called for to the Regal City of Damascus , leaving behinde him with his Army onely one Sinus as General. Although at Court he received not that welcome he seemed to expect; neither were the Citizens much noted to adore his fortunes, yet both he and all his faction, began to double, if not treble his former exclamations against the Government of the State, which for some time seemed to have lain asleep, by reason of his forreign employment, that obliged him to a necessary absence: These insolencies of Conderosus , (as they were interpreted by the Queens creatures and favourites) were held inconsistent with the peaceable quiet of the Syrian affairs, if not most dishonourable to the persons both of Orontes and his mother; wherefore in a private Councel, wherein none were admitted but Orestes, Mazarius , and some few others of the same interest, it was decreed, that Conderosus should be forthwith secur'd with may of his kindred, lest from his particular (though bold) discontent, might arise publick and dangerous troubles to the whole Kingdom; and the better as they believed, might they put in execution this design, for that Conderosus , by reason of some actions of pride, had lately much offended a great part of the Inhabitants of the rich and potent City of Damascus: To this purpose, one morning very early, the supream Councel of the Court pretending some weighty business of an extraordinary consequence, that had assembled them together, in which number as the most necessariest instruments belonging both to war and peace, Prince Conderosus could not possibly be spared, he was invited in all haste: Upon his arrival (the guards of the Kings house in the interim being doubled) his followers were desired by some of the Captains to stay below, because as they said, the Councel it self was held in the first Chamber above stairs, where were present both the King and the Queen; notwithstanding they pressed violently after their Lord, until he wisht them to retire into the Garden, where he would as he said, when the Councel should be ended, repair unto them by a back way through the privy Lodgings; whilst he was delivering thus much to his followers, there was one of the company told him in his ear, that he feared his person might be betrayed to some speedy confinement, in regard as they past along the souldiers, they might hear many speeches and whispers to that effect: Conderosus rather disdaining the thought of such an attempt, then apprehending any danger intended to his particular, hastily replyed, that he would fain encounter with the boldness of that person, which durst put in execution such an enterprize, since the power of the whole Court could not protect him from his indignation, if at all from the peoples hates and fury: With these words he passed up the stairs, where he had not remained many minutes, in an outward Room belonging to the Kings private Cabinet with two of his friends, before they were all three seized upon by half a score Officers, who helike had been appointed by the Queens direction to that service: Although Conderosus with a violent rage and impatiency, seemed to call the assistance of all the Gods to revenge his injuries; yet his two Brothers (who were also in the same condition of restraint as himself) not onely moderately began to expostulate with their Keepers, the reasons and causes of their imprisonment, but humbly desired to have some conference with the Queen about the business; but she, whether apprehending that they might prevail too much upon her nature, or fearing the company present would receive overmuch satisfaction by their Discourses, to the prejudice of her intentions and designs, being confident that Conderosus and his faction, could never be wrought absolutely to lay down their ambition, which she knew to be of a most dangerous consequence to the Crown and Affairs of Syria , pretended for the instant an indisposition in her health, and therefore could neither stir out of her chamber, or admit any dispute of a violent nature, which as she said the matter and these accidents must needs produce; onely she wisht the prisoners to rest patient and satisfied with their fortune, untill a more convenient season might produce their release: This Answer and Resolution quickly disposed of the Princes to their several lodgings within the Kings Palace, whilst in the interim, she, by the advice and directions chiefly of Mazarius , not onely set forth a Proclamation, towards the further satisfaction of the people and Citizens of Damascus , that contained in brief all the causes and reasons of Conderosus confinement, but underhand endeavoured to perswade Orestes the Kings Uncle, that the succession and prosperity of himself, would have been in danger to be destroyed, by the ambition and pride of young Conderosus , as well as the present Government of her Son, if either he were or should be at liberty: But however for that instant the City seemed not much enflamed at the business, being in some sort kept in order by the power of the Kings personal Guard, the Princes were secretly in the dead of the night removed to a strong Castle without the Town: After this, both Mazarius and the Queen for their better security, in a general Assembly in the Town-house of Damascus , where most of the Nobility within the City, accompanied by some principal Flamins of the Kingdom, were met together, not onely agreed but declared, that within a few moneths all the States of Syria should be called together, whereby the more indifferently to hear and determine the just grievances of the Nation, according to the ancient custom of the Kingdom, provided young Orontes some dayes before by the general allowance of themselves and people, might be proclaimed of full years to govern. This seemed both to content and please all sorts of interests; however it was thought by many wise men, that Mazarius and his faction, had in this particular out-witted the Assembly; when as for the present, he had not onely laid asleep all endeavours of the people, which might any way rise for the releasement of the Princes, but it would be absolutely in the Kings power, being acknowledged of full years to rule before the time appointed, either to dispose of the Assemblies actions and proceedings, according to his own and Mothers designs, or to break it up without doing any thing at all, as being a thing resolved on, whilst he was under years: The rather might it be so intended, in regard it was generally given out, that Mazarius , if not the Queen her self, should be questioned by that Authority: Neverthelesse to the outward view of the world, things went on for some time in a kinde of a fair progress, all people believing this expected great Assembly, would prove an absolute cure for the wounds, the Kingdom had received by misgovernment, during the non-age of the King; yet there might be noted amongst the common people, a certain bitter fling against the Queens power, and Mazarius proceedings; or rather the favour Mazarius had with Andromida: Besides the Princes releasements, from day to day were hotly pursued by Petitions and Requests, craftily put in by the procurement of some of their party, as conceiving without their liberty, it was unpossible, (wanting such a countenance) to oppose the Queens interest, by reason of the Kings years and authority: As these intendments and disputes were interrupted for some season, by reason that Sorastros King of Egypt (taking advantage of our discontents and troubles at home) invaded of a sudden the Syrian Territories with a powerful Army, so was Mazarius as 'twas thought by many, glad of this occasion, whereby he might (by exposing his own person in the Battle, that was necessarily to be fought between the two Nations) gain some opinion, concerning his fidelity and valour, amongst the common people of our Countrey: To say the plain truth, he carried himself so gallantly and wisely in that adventure, that not onely the General of Sorastros was beaten, and the whole Army routed, but many considerable Towns were presently rendred to his mercy and discretion. This however it returned him to Court, with a great deal of honour and satisfaction to those persons, that were altogether of the Queens faction, yet it neither took much with the desires of the multitude, or seemed one jot to lessen their desires, if not violence, to have the Princes forthwith released. Although both Mazarius and the Queen were something troubled, that neither of their endeavours could advance their own credits amongst the common people, or destroy the opinion of Conderosus with the multitude, since they believed it was grounded upon an ambition, that onely aimed to take away their authority; yet having confidence sufficient in the Kings power and their own interest, they resolved by some plausible attonement or other, to deliver the Princes, not onely free from their bonds, but to restore them again to all their ancient honours and dignities: Orestes the Kings Uncle, was something at the first apprehension troubled at this determination, in regard, that as in the beginning he had been possest with an opinion, how that Conderosus intended his destruction, as well as the lessening of Mazarius power, so was he to the outward appearance of the Councel, more violent then all the rest, to have both Conderosus and his friends restrained still for fear of future danger; his nature being something timerous as well as inconstant: But at last he was also absolutely converted, if not throughly pleased with the action; and to that purpose sent some complements to the Princes before they came out of Prison: Of the other side Mazarius to be beforehand with all the world, in respect, for that he imagined himself most suspected of all others; since conceived injuries are scarce ever forgotten by high spirits, when they mount to personal disgraces, made presently a journey himself to the Princes, where he not onely excused his own thoughts in particular concerning them, but laid the fault for the most part of their confinement upon Orestes ; whom they answered with the like complements, though by what thoughts of belief, it was not very well known, however much suspected: It was not many dayes after this, before Conderosus and his company came to Court, as it were to present the first fruits of their delivery to the King and Queen, who received them in outward appearance with all courtesie and favour could be imagined, that might either give satisfaction to the people, or content to themselves: notwithstanding within a while after, Conderosus not onely absented himself from Court, but in a manner kept his person continually in his own house, however visited daily by many friends, as it were onely attending the approaching time, both for the King to be declared of age, and the great Assembly to meet: Many opinions there were in the interim concerning his intentions: Some thought he abstained from the Kings Palace, whereby to be the sooner sent for, and put into eminent commands, according to his dignity and ambition; others again believed, that craftily he avoided all manner of suspicion, whereby upon the meeting of the great Councel, he might the likelier be put in trust with the whole affairs of the Kingdom unlookt for. But it was not very long ere his actions and carriage discovered evidently his intentions to the world; for the time arriving of the King coming to years, whereupon he was declared sole and absolute Governour of all his Dominions; the first thing he did was to constitute and publish his Mother the supream and onely President of his Councel. This quickly enflamed both the thoughts and spleen of Conderosus , in being thus, as he supposed, circumvented in all his aims; insomuch, as from thenceforward, he not onely forbore totally any correspondency with the Court affairs, but in a most disdainful manner, oftentimes would pass most scornfully by the Kings house, accompanied by multitudes of followers, without either salutation or respect given to his Princes dignity: Nor did he end his proceedings in this manner; for within a very few weeks after, he flew out of the City of Damascus into his own Countrey, with violence and execrations, both against Mazarius and the Queen: Where being arrived, when he had made his Brother Governour for him in the chief City of the Province, which Town had been a long time disaffected to the Kings Party, he began not onely to fortifie himself for his defence, but endeavoured to raise Souldiers as fast as he could, whereby to form an Army, that he might with all expedition contend with the Kings Forces: To this purpose he first sent for his Lieutenant General, whom he had left upon the Confines of Egypt , who quickly came to his assistance, with those Troops under the Kings pay, that had been formerly designed to defend the City of Memphis ; by which means that Town, after something a long siege, was again lost to the prevailing power of Sorastros their lawful King: In the next place he dispatched a messenger to the Court, with these Propositions to be presented in the names of the Princes, both to Orontes and the Queen Mother, who seemed yet to bear a kinde of equal share of Government with her Son; they contained in effect these desires, or rather might they be esteemed commands, for the peremptoriness of their stile and matter: First, they required to have Mazarius banished the Kingdom of Syria: Next, they intimated, not onely to have a general pardon granted for all misdemeanours whatsoever, committed by any of their party and faction, but also speedily to have the injured Princes, as they called themselves, with the rest of the Nobility, restored to their ancient priviledges and offices; besides the addition of some new honours and commands to be bestowed upon them: And lastly, they required to have a general peace concluded between the two Crowns of Egypt and Syria . To these demands this answer was quickly returned; That Mazarius resolved within a very few dayes, to withddraw himself from the Court and Kingdom to some forreign parts, whereby to give better satisfaction to that unity pretended; however as he said, it stood both with the honour and justice of the Kingdom, to suffer him first to come to a legal tryal before competent Judges, where he refused not to answer, whereby the better to clear his own actions from slander, since he conceived hitherunto, he was so far from having commited crimes against the good of the King and his people, that he had performed many eminent services towards the honour and prosperity of the Kingdom of Syria: To the second, which concerned the Princes, and other of the Nobility, this farther reply was made; That however they seemed now to be in open rebellion against the Kings undoubted authority, yet was his Majesty willing by the advice of his Councel, whereby a lasting friendship and obedience, might in the general be settled amongst his people, not onely to pardon, but to restore the Princes to his favour, with an additition also of such offices bestowed upon them, as he could conveniently grant, and they in reason require: And last of all, concerning the peace desired between the two Crowns, as the King would not be failing in any kinde to entertain the motion, so should the judgement of the particulars be left to the opinions of the great Assembly, that shortly were to meet about the principal affairs of the Nation; provided that all these things being performed, both Conderosus , and the rest of his faction, should presently lay down Arms, and fairly return to their wonted obedience: Although these determinations were not onely sent to Conderosus , but presently put in execution, accordingly; yet he began, instead of dismissing of his Souldiers as he had promised, to make new quarrels against the Queens domestick servants, pretending, that however Mazarius was really in person departed the Kingdom of Syria , nevertheless, he had left behinde him in the Queens Cabinet his spirit, with those creatures of his that would have still a supream influence in all the Councels of State, that should be agitated in any kinde; wherefore unless they or any others that might be named, were also banished with their Lord and Master, as it was impossible to procure security for himself or the other Princes, that seemed to be in Arms against his power and proceedings. These insolencies withal became fortified, not onely by the countenance of Orestes the Kings Uncle, who had conceived some new dislike against Mazarius and the Queen, but more especially was increased by the active endeavours of a young Lady called Pentheselea , Sister to Conderosus ; whose fortunes that belonged unto her by descent from her Mother, had been kept from her possession for some time by the power of the Court: So that in effect, the proceedings that had been already begun towards a good settlement of affairs, seemed now to be vanished into nothing but smoak and air: and the rather, for that the Prince Orestes himself, contracted some more then ordinary hatred against the Queen and her Councel, in regard that Mazarius had declared to Conderosus , that he had been the chief, if not onely means of the Princes confinements: Besides it was thought, that Orestes had a design to bring in one of his own favourites, to supply the places of banisht Mazarius : All these reasons, I say, being put together, were no doubt occasions still to continue the differences; insomuch as the Queen was constrained to provide, not onely for the Kings support, but her own defence, in regard as she very well perceived (by those propositions Conderosus had made, to have some of her servants of trust banished with Mazarius ) her own jurisdiction and power amongst other things, was also aimed to be destroyed, if not with it the absolute authority of her Son. As this occasioned new and violent leavies of all sides, so was it not long before Andromida and the King quitted the great City of Damascus , to the absolute dispose of Orestes , who as they found, was neither to be won to their party, or the Townsmen long to be secured by them, where the interest of the Princes had so great an influence; besides they were also informed, that most part of the Citizens, had a design privately to have separated the King from his Mother: After the King and the Queen had thus freed themselves from these dangers, they presently repaired to their Army in the Field; between which and the Souldiers of Conderosus , there had been already many encounters of various success. Andromida and Orontes finding their affairs in this perplexity, the Princes powers increasing, retired into a strong Town well fortified for their defence, having neither many Troops to contend with their Adversaries Forces, or much money left them to pay such as they had already raised, in regard most of the Royal Revenues were absolutely obstructed throughout the whole Kingdom: When they had remained for some weeks in that place, in the interim understanding daily of the various success of their small Army, whilst their ears were continually tormented with new Petitions from other Cities, all in a manner perswading the King, rather to yield to the desires and demands of the Princes, then to continue a dangerous and hazzardable War, with the blood and lives of his poor Subjects; of a sudden Mazarius himself appeared with a most powerful and gallant Army, that had been procured by his money and industry in other Countries, though now led by himself in person, for the assistance and defence of Kingly power, to be imployed as he pleased, either against Conderosus or any other that should oppose: As I shall not need to say that this brought comfort, and consequently gave encouragement to the Kings drooping Party, so was it resolved presently to march towards their enemies: Conderosus of the other side finding by this increase of the Court Army, he should not be able probably long to contend in the Field, presently sent a trusty messenger to Sorastros King of Egyp , with whom belike he had made a former accord, whereby to dispatch presently to his assistance, what Troops were needful for his present support: Withal he invited into Syria a Prince named Austratius , Brother to the vertuous and unfortunate Lady Alciana , whose memorable story is something too tedious in this place to relate, however with a promise, that if he would speedily march to his aid, he should not onely be a means to procure a general and happy peace, between the two Crowns of Syria and Egypt , whereby he would again be put in possession of his own Countrey, so long detained unjustly from him, by the violent oppressions of Mazarius and Philostros , but did undertake also to deliver many considerable Towns upon the Frontiers into his hands, the better to assure him of his real intentions: In this manner I may say, he set all wheels a going at once, that might in any kinde prejudice and disturb his own King Orontes ; imploying at the same time, certain Commissioners into the Kingdom of Lydia , to the Senate sitting at Sardis , to desire either Money, Souldiers, or Ships, against both the Queen and Mazarius , who as he said, intended to become mortal enemies to their proceedings, in the right and quarrel of Prince Arethusius your most noble Brother, whensoever their own troublesome affairs should be either ended or in some sort qualified: I cannot well inform your Highness particularly, concerning his messengers imployment to the State of Lydia , in regard that however they are invited to a correspondency of Trade, with some Cities now under the jurisdiction of Conderosus , yet perhaps the Senate remaining at Sardis , cannot spare those supplies demanded, wherefore will be unwilling to entertain any correspondency, that may prove prejudicial to them hereafter, in that such an inclination demonstrated, is of a dangerous consequence to all their affairs and designs. But however as I say, those Councellours at Sardis , may be cautious enough in this particular; yet not onely Sorastros King of Egypt sent Conderosus presently supplies to his Army; but also Prince Austrasius himself with a certain kinde of flying Forces (which he had alwayes kept on foot since the loss of his Countrey) came speedily into the Kingdom of Syria: Our Queen Andromida having received certain intelligence of this design, the Souldiers marching with some violence towards the stubborn, if not rebellious City of Damascus , whereby the better to unite all the power of Conderosus together; conjured Prince Arethusius as an interessed Kinsman to Austrasius , to imploy part of his noble endeavours and perswasions with his valiant Cousin, to divert if it were possible his intentions from joyning his Forces with the rebellions, as she termed them of Conderosus ; withal giving him full commission, not onely to treat, but to assure that Prince, as well of a great sum of money towards his return back again to his old quarters, but also to have his Countrey to be fully restored to his possession, upon the happy concluding of a general peace; which as she said, was really intended by the King and State of Syria . In short, the young Prince your Brother quickly undertook the imployment, (as much in regard of his noble disposition, as for that he hoped the Catastrophe would produce profitable consequences towards his own affairs.) And this indeavour as it shoold seem, after many journeyes made by him between the Court and Austrasius's Camp, he concluded some agreement; however as yet the particular points are not come to the knowledge of vulgar intelligence: For that, as Austrasius presently declared himself, he entered into the Kingdom of Syria , not so much to fight and destroy, as to bring peace and benefit to the people; so upon the approach of the Kings Souldiers, and the Army of Conderosus near the City of Damascus, Austrasius openly protested his resolutions to set upon either party, that should enter upon actions of blood, without allowing those good purposes he had, at his first entrance into the Kingdom to make peace: As Conderosus seemed something amazed at these proceedings, so received he presently these answers from Austrasius to his own violent expostulations: That himself had not performed the agreement, in delivering the Towns promised into his hands; wherefore he not being any way his obliged servant, had no reason but to look to those obligations, that belonged to the general good of all Asia before his particular; which he hoped, as he said, his own intentions and endeavours would ere it were long produce to the world: Conderosus having not much to answer to these objections, and fearing lest some farther design might be to entrap his Army to the Kings Forces, presently retired himself with his Company towards the City of Damascus , whilst as conveniently as he could, he quartered his Souldiers round about the walls of the Town, not onely for his own better safety; but the more probably still to retain the hearts of the Inhabitants firm to his purposes: In conclusion, Austrasius hath now withdrawn all his Troops out of our Kingdom of Syria , and the Kings Army hath besieged the City, however at such a distance that it produceth variable successes betwen their Forces: In effect this is as much as I can say of our affairs; wherein I have been the larger in my expressions to your excellency, for that I presume with an absolute confidence, neither my discourses or opinions, shall go farther then your own private thoughts; and the rather am I bold to require this honourable justice at your hands, for that I am imployed in places and offices of trust under the Court, which in the general is onely steered by the will and pleasure of Mazarius . As young Ascanius assured the Governour, that his own thoughts should be scarce acquainted with any thing to his prejudice, so upon the consideration of those particulars he had delivered, his natural courage again became extreamly inflamed to be in personal action in the Wars: With this resolution presently after the Officer was departed, he made Mercuris privy to his intentions and desires: although his servant commended for the present his gallant and brave inspirations, yet he could not resolve what imployments would best suit with his dignity and condition: Of the other side he doubted lest the fewness of his years were not yet of a sufficient capacity, to entertain those toils and inconveniencies, that appertained to the strict rules of a Souldiers life; so that he wisht him a little to bridle those thoughts, until his arrival at the Queen his Mother, whose love, experience, and knowledge (as he said) would direct his resolutions, to the best advantage both for his benefit and honour: This intimation he gave him, for fear he might precipitately run into hazzards, before he should have the full consent of his friends, and that himself might be suspected to have given him such counsel, without their privity and allowance; especially the Queens consent wanting, whom he knew had ambition enough in her own nature, to prescribe her Children wayes concerning the King her Husbands affairs; when as his chief assistance, as she believed, was to be procured by her interest in the Kingdom of Syria: The opportunity happened well enough for these diversions, in regard the Governour of Sidon , having received so strict a command for both the honourable and delightful entertainment of Prince Ascanius , gave his minde but small space for any resolution whatsoever: To this purpose, after he had feasted him in a magnificent manner, by all the chief Magistrates of the City, he shewed him the fortifications of the Town, and then accompanied him to behold one of the richest and fairest Temples in Syria or the world. The Fabrick was round, being supported by an hundred and odd Pillars, each containing in length threescore and one foot, (besides the Capital and Bases) all of one intire stone: The middle part of the building was crowned with a brave Cupelo of fifty yards in Diameter, most curiously guilded on the out side; which by reason of the Suns reflection, gave a certain kinde of an amazed delight to the spectators: Before the entrance of the Temple in a large Plain, was erected a high Obeliske of an incredible greatness, to be raised by the labour and industry of man; it was placed upon a pedestal eighteen foot from the ground: The Gates were wrought through to the day, with artificial knots of Brass, however they had double coverings to keep them from the view and prejudice of the people: Upon their entring there appeared in the midst, the high Altar with several steps for the Flamins to mount, whereby with conveniency to perform their Hecatombes, and other Ceremonies belonging to their Office: As from the four squares of the great Altar, stood in opposition as many Gates, which belonged to the entrance of the Temple, so from the four corners at the same distance obliquely, were as many lesser Altars, where other inferiour Priests were accustomed to sacrifice: so that at one instant, the beauty of the whole building was to be beheld for the more grace and delight: This also became extreamly increased, for that the roof overhead, was enriched with Azure and Gold, that onely made the necessary distinction and circumference of many rare paintings, that were neatly designed into almost all the remarkable stories of the Gods, whilst the windows on the sides, gave clarity sufficient to behold them with the best advantage: at length they mounted a winding pair of stairs to the top of the Temple where a large and even gallery, encompassed round about the Cupelo, from whence of one side they had the vast prospect of the main Oceans, as of the other, a brave champion Countrey, drest as I may say, all over with several varieties both of nature and art: Of each hand was cunningly placed groves of wood, which were artificial, interchanged one with another, that it became a difficult question to the apprehension of the earnest spectator, whether industry, or chance, had most plaid the master in that beautiful overage; for that the many fountains of divers kindes, some making a noise, and others running on gently in their course, gave both delight and wonder at the same time, as not to be easily comprehended, how that element could be so prevalent in that place, when no River at all appeared to the outward view: The Temple it self was seated upon a rising Plain, some furlongs out of the City, yet not altogether so far from the Sea-side as from the Town; upon the Banks whereof was built, a certain fair and convenient Watch-Tower; not onely for the conveniency of such Ships as should enter the Haven by night, but also in time of need, to serve for a surer Guard to the Temple; where remained to that purpose many Souldiers continually in pay: When Ascanius had sufficiently viewed all these beauties, they descended again into the body of the Temple, where they found gathered together many Priests, according to the daily custome of the place, apparelled in white Vestments, to perform their wonted Ceremonies, for the peace and prosperity of Syria: First they marched two by two round about the high Altar, with golden Censers in their hands, singing Hymnes and casting Incense: Last of all they offered Sacrifice in such Robes as were appointed for the Office: No sooner were all these Devotions performed, (first to Jupiter the great Deity of Olympus , next to every inferiour God and Goddess, as they were called in particular) but the chief Priests themselves, addrest themselves to Prince Ascanius , not onely to afford him the respects and complements of the Temple, but understanding he was of another belief, according to the practice of the Flamins of Lydia , to satisfie him in those points concerning the Worship of the Gods, which seemed to differ in either Kingdom: In the first place they told him, that as themselves observed their ancient obedience, belonging to the Arch-Flamin of Delphos , by which means they retained a certain kinde of unity in all their Ceremonies, so did they not (however it might otherwise appear, to the outward view of such as were not acquainted with their faith, of which number they supposed him to be one in his education) give any Divine Worship, but to one God onely, whom they esteemed the great Creatour both of Heaven and Earth; however the rest in special manner, had their remembrances by way of relative honour, derived from his power, who was willing to have them respected as his friends: Neither as they said, were they under the jurisdiction of their Arch-Flamin , but in those things that belonged onely to matters of Religion; but were obliged in Temporal actions, to obey their Princes and Magistrates, unless they commanded them contrary to their principles, appertaining to the real Worship of the Gods; which no humane power, as they said, had power to absolve, though it were to preserve either life or estate: When they had made an end of this short discourse, they intimated to the Prince, that as they hoped in time he would come to be of the same opinion, so should they not fail daily, to pray to the Gods for his greater honour and prosperity, as well as for his more assured happiness in the world to come, where he must expect to live for all eternity. As Ascanius seemed to be extreamly satisfied with these entertainments, so would he no otherwise answer their arguments then by a gentle smile; onely he told them, he wanted some of his own Priests to give them better solutions, which for the present his little learning was not able to perform: and with these words took his leave both of them and the Temple. It was not many dayes after this discourse, that Ascanius with many gallant Troops of Horse, attended by some of the principal Nobility, and Gentry of the Countrey of Sidonia , was conducted to the Queen his Mothers Court, then remaining a quarter of a dayes journey from the great City of Damascus: As soon as he came to her presence, he kneeled down to kiss her hands, though she had scarce opportunity given her, by reason of her affectionate tears, to afford him other expressions, then what proceeded from a certain kinde of lamenting joy, made up between her gladness to see him, and sorrow that she had not ability sufficient to receive him as Euarchus Son, since her own present condition, was constrained, to be in a sort beholding to others for her own personal subsistance: Ascanius presently replyed, that however both she and all her children, had been competently injured by the spiteful and unrelenting strokes of fortune, yet he hoped the Gods would not be so cruel, as to deprive them of the courage and vertues of their mindes, that he doubted not, but would continue the family still in such a posture, that might make them able, to contend against what difficulty soever; in the interim he intended, as he said, not onely to live by the glory of his own Sword, but by his noble endeavours, to procure both honour and profit for his friends, if need required: What answer this declaration of young Ascanius , would have produced from the Queen, could not be known, for that her eldest Son Prince Arethusius (hearing of the arrival of his Brother) came presently into the Chamber: After he had with such affectionate imbracements, as became the nearness of their blood, and their long separation, held Ascanius inclosed within his armes for a great space, he turned himself to the Queen with these words: Madam, said he, as your desires and wishes, are now partly satisfied, in beholding my Brother free from those unjust incumbrances, that have withheld him all this while from your sight, so now I must beseech your goodness, being you have him so absolutely in your possession, both by nature and fortune, to grant me also such an interest in your right, that at leastwise, sometimes I may enjoy his company and conversation, in those noble exercises, that most properly belong to the Syrian Nation; and rather do I presume upon my request, for that, as it will render me extreamly contented in my thoughts, so will it afford my Brother such graces, to beautifie all his other natural perfections, that he cannot chuse, as I hope, but become admirable to the worlds eye: Truly Son, replyed the Queen, as I shall never be wanting in my affections to any of my Children, so of the other side, I do implore the immortal Gods, that I may never become so over indulgent, by reason of any kinde of natural sensuality, that they thereby, may be either injur'd in their education, or blasted in their reputation: To this purpose take your Brother to your self; and as you have gained more experience by your travels for the present, and must be in the future his Prince, dispose of my right in him for the most benefit to his honour, and your own advantage: Ascanius seemed at these words to be something discontented, that in any kinde whatsoever he should be directed, much less prescribed in his thoughts and resolutions: Nevertheless, after he had a little time rested with his eyes cast upon the ground (apprehending belike it was some shame to his courage before the company, as it were in a manner to be committed to the jurisdiction of his elder Brother) he told the Queen that however he hoped, his actions should never give her any just cause to complain of his disobedience, yet since she was willing, to bestow her own interest so absolutely upon another, he doubted not, but she would also think it most reasonable, that himself in the first place, should make election of the course he was to take, provided it were not any way dishonourable to the Royal Family: This being granted him, as he said, he would chuse some present imployment in the wars, if she or his Brother, would contribute some endeavours to purchase him Arms and Knighthood, he was confident enough, that his own courage would quickly gain himself both Fortune and Honour: as it was easily to be perceived by this discourse, at what designs young Ascanius aimed at in his thoughts, so was it to no purpose in the opinion of the Queen and Arethusius , to go about to divert him from his resolutions: Wherefore they both promised him their best assistance; withal telling him, that the most properest season to motion such desires, was, when he should go to Court, and present his respects to the King; whither as they said, they also intended to accompany him. The next day they went to Court; as soon as they were alighted out of their Chariots, at the innermost Gate of the Palace, where none were suffered to enter but Sovereign Princes, Hyacinthia the Queen took Ascanius by the hand, whilst Arethusius in the interim, marched before them, with a gallant Plume of Feathers upon his head, which for the more grace hung down upon his back, with three or four falls. In this order they went up into the presence, where the young King was newly seated, encompassed about by many Noblemen of the Syrian Nation; besides Creses that had been formerly sent out of the Kingdom of Lydia by Roxana , attended near Orontes for the present, to acquaint him more particularly, with those discourses that should proceed from Ascanius , by reason as 'twas thought, he might be yet something ignorant of the Countrey customs, if not language: When they approached at a certain distance, Hyacinthia uttered this language to the King: Sir, said she, I am come at this time, not onely to present this young Prince to your view, but for your service: 'Tis true, his fates have hitherunto made him a prisoner by reason of my fortunes; but the Gods have at last enlarg'd him for his own honour, which I am the rather confident of, in regard his minde suits with your occasions: If he can prove profitable to you in the Wars, I have my wishes, as he hath his desire: As I should be glad to see you attended by none but Princes, so must I tell you, that this young man, claims a just right in the imployment by inheritance; for all stories of the Kingdom of Syria inform us, that the second Son to the King of Myssia , may duly challenge the command of all those forces about your person; which joyned together with the interest of his blood, I hope you may be sure both of his endeavours and fidelity; since as the one must honour himself, so the other I hope will secure you. There yet remains this request behinde, that the first favour you bestow upon his youth, may be the honour of Knighthood, which will be a necessary step, to those actions he desires to perform in the service of Syria ; leaving the rest to the Gods and Fortune, as my self to be a continual wisher of your eternal happiness. All the company about the King, were a little transported with delight and admiration, to behold this new and unexpected representation; however Orontes himself by reason of the fewness of his years was something out of countenance, until a grave Nobleman of the Court told him, that as it would be a shame for a great King to deny any Lady, much less a fair Queen her request; so was it his duty, presently to draw out his own Sword, and Knight his young Cousin: This was directions sufficient, not onely to cause him to honour Ascanius with his own personal order, but to let the Quen his Aunt also know with some youthful expressions, that he intended alwayes to obey her intimations, not as desires onely but for commands rather: When many imbracements and other testimonies of love, had past of both sides, the King himself accompanied them to make also another visit to Andromida: Their entertainments there were after another manner; for Andromida imployed her self in outward appearance, to behold the beauty of Ascanius , as well as to enquire after his education; at last she askt him concerning his own adventures, with the Senate of Lydia during his imprisonment, and what he supposed they intended to do with the King his Father, with their strength and power both by Land Sea? to all which she received such ample satisfactions by his discreet and solid answers, that she became rather an admirer, then a commender of his wit. In conclusion, understanding what the King her Son had already done concerning his Knighthood, she instantly took off a rich Scarfe, which she had then about her, and wisht Ascanius to wear it for a Ladies sake, that not onely desired he might gain, as much honour in the defence of Syria , as ever any Prince of his Nation had done by invading it. As this gave encouragement to his thoughts, so had he the opportunity within a few dayes to shew his courage, though he wanted experience in the Wars; for the Army which Conderosus had left behinde him, under the command of his Lieutenant General Sinus , came in a violent march towards the City of Damascus , where they understood their Prince and Master was straitly besieged: To prevent this design some Troops were imployed from Court, with all expedition to hinder his intention; amongst whom Ascanius to begin his Prenticeship would needs be active: both the Armies encountered one another, not far distant from a small Town, that had onely fortifications to defend it self from a suddain surprize: Truly I may say the encounter seemed something desperate at the first charge; for both sides being enflamed, either with spite or courage, seemed for some time to give way to neithers valour or violence; yet the Kings Forces being fewer in number, and having withal the disadvantage of the ground, at last began a little to give back: But presently Ascanius , who commanded that day the Kings own guard of Horse, attended by Creses his Lieutenant, perceiving not onely the danger but the disgrace, told the Souldiers in the Syrian language, that he never believed, to finde such want of courage in people of that Nation, whose fame had been formerly spread through the world: With these words he advanced before his Troops with so much fury, that he quickly made a large path, not onely for his own passage, but for his followers to commit almost what slaughter they pleased; till at last, he arrived at Sinus the General, with whom he began a single combat, that might have deserved more room and less confused spectators: In conclusion, after that Sinus had received many wounds by the hand of the young Prince, (finding not onely that his fortunes began to decline, but that his Forces were likely to be circumvented) he retired, (with as many Souldiers as he had remaining) into the fortifications of the Town, whither notwithstanding, they were pursued with violence enough, to have been totally overthrown, if by the sudden pulling up of a draw-bridge, part of the Forces had not been saved and secured. This was no small discontent to gallant Ascanius , whose ambitions courage was yet impatient of a greater victory: Before the Town he continued himself in person, lying every night in the field amongst the common Souldiers, where he performed also such other memorable acts, as were rather to be admired, then imitated by others of his youth and quality; Orontes hearing at Court of his same, sent presently messengers, as well to congratulate his bravery, as to call him back again to his presence: As Ascanius could not well disobey the Kings commands, so at his arrival at Court, what praises could possibly be bestowed upon youth and valour, was not onely afforded him from all the Nobility in the General, but also Queen Andromida's Ladies strived, who should most enrich him with their favours. Notwithstanding all these extraordinary indulgencies, Ascanius appeared to the whole Court to be out of his proper element: But the King a little to divert his appetites from those dangerous employments of the war; wherein he desired to hazard people of a far meaner condition, since he knew he had more profitable designs to undertake, for the good of Lydia , caused a day to be appointed for the hunting of the Wilde Boar, whilst in the interim he recommended the care of the siege, unto a circumspect General, that neither wanted valour in his person, or skilfulness in his conduct: As this entertainment for some few dayes, gave a great deal of employment to Ascanius thoughts, in regard the Ladies of the Queen for the most part, accompanied the King in that generous exercise; so one day by chance, the Dogs having the chafed and enraged beast at the bay, under an old Oak, where he had the advantage of the company, by setting his hinder parts against the body of the tree, he kept, not onely the Hunsmen, but the very Hounds themselves at a far distance: Nevertheless when Orontes came in to the sport, the youthful Nobility of the Court, thinking it a kinde of dishonour to their Mistresses, (according to the practice of the Syrian Nation) not to perform some gallant and brave actions in the Chase; especially seeing the King was present, and would be a Royal eye-witness of their glorious endeavours, with their Spears in their hands, set upon that ugly though resolute creature, whom had onely nature to teach him both valour and skill: however within a quarter of an hours space, three or four of the bravest youths of the Court, were dangerously wounded, whilst in the interim the Boat seemed in a melancholly though furious way, to triumph exceedingly in his new purchased victory, beholding the Trophies of his cruelty, to lye before him upon the ground, besmeared all over with their own blood; and the rather, for that none approached as he could perceive, to do him any more injury for the present: This gave some occasion to the King, to lament the sad disaster of so many of his servants; wherefore he commanded the Huntsmen to employ all their engines, without any more hazzard to his followers, to bring that horrid if not infernal creature, by what means soever they could possibly use, to his speedy destruction: But whilst they were gone with all the haste they could to their several lodges, the speedier to effect the Kings pleasure, Ascanius , when every body almost in the company, was onely discoursing of the fury of the beast, and the unfortunate accident that befell those young men, that had attempted his slaughter, he cast his spear at some distance at the Boar, which sticking upright in his breast, he presently closed with him, and happily catching hold of the staff, he not onely thrust it farther into his body, but struggled so long with him, until at last his much loss of blood made him begin to faint, and so consequently resting with his tail upon the ground; the rest of the company had opportunity enough, not onely to draw out their swords, but to give him his deaths wound, which filled the whole Court with wonder and amazement: The young King presently embraced his valiant Couzen, both with joy and affection; yet there was an old officer of the Court, that not onely reproved him for his bold and rash attempt, as he said in needless exposing his person to so great a danger, but told him, that such enterprizes were no means, to purchase again the Crowns of Lydia and Myssia for his Fathers Interest; rather it would be esteemed by all the world, a greater part of wisdom, if not magnanimity, to reserve himself for the services necessary to that purpose: Ascanius gave him no answer but with a smile, as it might be thought rather contemning his cold providence, then any way shewed that he intended to be converted by his counsel: of the other side, all the Ladies were so much transported with his youthful courage and resolution, that some of them cast him fancies from their own bosomes, others stuck many Ribonds, bedecked with flowers upon the out-side of his garments as he past by; and a third sort, that at the instant were not furnished with other favours, pulled off their Gloves from their white hands, to make him a present of their affections, in the general all coveted to do something that might honour his merit; or rather as I may say endeavoured to grace themselves; whilst in a kinde of a Triumph, he was conducted to Andromida the Queen, there again from her approbation, to receive a new confirmation of his worth and valour. But during the time that these congratulations, with other delights employed the thoughts and actions of many of the Court, Conderosus was not idle in the great City of Damascus , not onely to animate the Inhabitants against the proceedings of Mazarius , but sent certain Troops of his choicest Souldiers, that surprized a little Town belonging to the Kings quarters, which being understood by Prince Ascanius , and some other of the Nobility belonging to the Army, they hasted at leastwise to the attempting of some design, that might either again recover the loss, or wipe away the dishonour from themselves; which so fortunately succeeded according to their intentions, that upon the first charge, they not onely defeated those Forces, that were appointed without to guard the Fort, but also within a while after, by the entire slaughter almost of all the Garrisons, they possessed themselves absolutely both of the Castle and the Town: The news of this unexpected conflict, quickly called Conderosus with all his power out of the City of Damascus , with an intention to give some relief to his worsted Forces, which also invited a great part of the Kings Army to advance: so that within half an hours space, the Souldiers in entire bodies met of both sides, between the City and the Camp. The King in person for that present remained near that place, out of a youthful and courageous desire, not onely to behold the determinable issue of those encounters, but also to give the best encouragement was possible, to such Troops as were engaged in the service; 'Tis true Conderosus came on with the furious countenance of a Lion, neither were his actions improperly to be compared to the courage and nature of that beast, when either he is inflamed by his choller, or disappointed of what he doth most desire; for when the Armies were joyned, he cut down lives all the way he went with that haste, as if his intentions had onely been, to remove obstacles, that hindred the destruction of the huge Syrian Monarchy; in this confusion coming near Ascanius , he salutes him in this language: Sir, said he, as I cannot without some spiteful injustice, but give you commendation, as well for your fortune and gallantry in defeating my Forces, as that at present I finde heroical thoughts are still continued in your youthful bosome, so of the other side I do more then wonder, how such a valour can be employed in the defence of him, (I mean Mazarius ) that occasions the injury of all the whole Kingdom of Syria: Although there was not much time for any expostulation, where weapons points were to be both the Judges and Executioners, yet Prince Ascanius thought good to return him this answer, As you must give me leave, said he, to deny those principles of yours, which belike entertain you with contrary opinions; so on the other side I must tell you, (in as good Syrian language as I can utter) that my endeavours in this martial exercise, depend onely upon my own duty, in the promise I have made to the uttermost of my power, to defend the Crown and Dignity of young Orontes ; which as I am informed, you have an intention to destroy contrary to your fidelity and allegiance: Conderosus was so bitten with these last words, that instead of any reply at all, he flew at Ascanius , with such violence and fury, that the best valour in Syria , would have esteemed it honour enough, to have opposed his blows; but the yong Prince did not only for a long time defend himself with an equal if not a prevailing fortitude, but by the example of his courage and bravery, those Troops that were already engaged in the fight, came on with so much resolution, that presently Conderosus Forces began to give back; which he seeing, and conceiving withal that any seeming fear or disadvantage, would a little prejudice his cause in the City of Damascus , made a blow at the head-peece of Ascanius ; withall telling him to accompany his stroke, that this he hoped would be sufficient to end the present dispute between them; however the sword lighting upon the side of his arms, not onely broke with the force, but the piece remaining in his hand by chance killed his Horse; insomuch as Ascanius was constrained at that instant to alight, without having the opportunity at the present to revenge himself: Of the other side, Conderosus made what haste he could with his company towards the City: Ascanius earnestly desired Creses and the rest of his friends, to furnish him with another Horse; but they supposing he had done already in that dayes action enough, both for the Kings service and his own honour, all bloody and dirty as he was, they conducted him into the Kings presence: There will be no need to specifie Orontes congratulations; onely I must say, that often did Ascanius attempt with much violence and importunity, to be again engaged in the company of those Troops, that were directed by the Kings command, to follow Conderosus to the Walls of Damascus ; though by no means could he be admitted to that enterprize, for fear of further danger to his person; for the Kings peremptory injunction proved an entire obstacle to Ascanius's desires: Nevertheless, the whole Army followed the other Troops to the Gates of Damascus ; so that Conderosus remained as it were besieged for some hours, in regard the Magistrates of the City seemed to deny him entrance: Yet the Souldiers were detained at some distance, by reason the Garrison upon the Battlement within the Town, defended the Prince and his Company with their Darts and Arrows. But Pentheselea hearing of her Brothers dangerous condition, like another Amazon Lady, not onely endeavoured, by her earnest perswasions and threatning Rethorick, to stir up the compassion, if not the love of the common people, to the ready assistance of Conderosus , but went presently her self to the chief Magistrate of the City, where after she had demonstrated sufficient discontent in her looks at his proceedings, holding a Dagger ready drawn in her hand, she swore by the the immortal Gods, that if he did not instantly give entrance to her Brother, she would quickly make that weapon (which she had brought to no other purpose) finde a ready passage through his heart: The Officer being amazed at the daring boldness of the young Lady, conceiving withall, that the same spirit that had led her on to such a resolution, would cause her to be as certain in the executing of her design, made in a manner as much haste to give her content, as she had appeared to be violent in the satisfaction: so that in an humble posture, craving pardon for any offence he had given her, either at present or any other time, he besought her, that he might have liberty to fetch the keyes out of his Cabinet: In his passage, he saw the whole house was newly beset round about, with multitudes of the inferior sort of people, who with loud voices in the street, cryed out for the speedy satisfaction of the Princesse; wherefore perceiving for the present there was no protraction, much less denial in any thing that should be desired, after his return, he delivered the keyes, with an humble and fearful countenance into her hands; when he had satisfied her in this manner, she bid him in something a milder way then she used in her first entrance, to put off all his distractions, for now he had granted her request as she said, she assured him, his person for the future should be safe, both from her own displeasure, or the peoples fury: When she was descended the stairs, she went presently towards the Gates of the Town, being guarded and followed by whole Troops of the baser kinde of Citizens, where instantly giving her Brother entrance, he quartered his Souldiers all over the City. The richer sort of people found by this strange and violent enterprize, that neither their goods or lives could be long in a secure condition, if some agreement were not presently made with their King, since they were most certain, their purses should be made pay for the contention, as the Kings Forces without the walls, would keep them from all provisions necessary for their subsistance; the rather as they conceived, for that the Souldiers of Conderosus began already to be something disorderly within the City: Wherefore privately they consulted amongst themselves, what was best to be done to prevent the growing mischief; at last they resolved to send under-hand to Court, whereby if it were possible by some fair Treaty of Peace, to compass their own pardons: Upon the arrival of their Messengers within the Kings Camp, they had not onely presently free admittance to his presence, who was at that instant accompanied by the Queen his Mother, but they found such a gracious inclination of agreement in the Kings words and countenance, that they returned that night back again to the City, extreamly well satisfied in their thoughts: The next morning a general Assembly was appointed in the Town-house, where there met the Nobility, the Lawyers, and the Citizens: After those Deputies that were sent to Court, had made an ample report of their whole proceedings; as also intimated their kinde and honourable reception both by the King and Councel, all the company presently cryed out, Peace, peace, peace: Conderosus , who until then had not spoken one word in the meeting, finding their resolutions were absolutely tending violently against his ends, in a fury rose up and told the Assembly, that although they had base mindes to be couzened into a perpetual slavery, by the tyrannical and cunning policy of Mazarius , yet himself was resolved to live and die a free Subject of the Kingdom of Syria ; and therefore desired to be quietly dismissed with his Troops from their farther protection, whereby to seek better adventures in some other Regions; though most part of the Company were inwardly joyful, to be securely rid of such a flaming firebrand, (to which purpose they gave him fair words to forward his design) yet some being more addicted to his Faction, alledged, that 'twas no way fit and reasonble, that a gallant Prince of such a high extraction, who had onely taken up Arms for the justifiable Right of his Countreys Priviledges, should depart from their City, and enter into new and uncertain fortunes, without convenient satisfaction, in what he should desire both of themselves and the King: Whilst these considerations came to some height in disputation, the Town-house was suddenly beset with a great Rabble of common people, whom Conderosus's Sister Pentheselea had incited, to disturb the resolutions of peace; neither did they long continue in a quiet posture, but with violent words, that reproached many of the Assembly, they began to set fire to the Gate of the Fort: As the Guard of the place were commanded presently with their offensive Arms, to defend the Nobility and the Citizens there assembled, so all in the general, who were not armed, betook themselves to their own security; some flying one way, others hiding them severally in divers corners of the Castle; and a third sort being more confident of their safety amongst the multiude, issued out into the Market- place, rather chusing some hazzard in that nature, then to endanger their persons in consuming flames, which they knew could not be taught mercy or compassion in any kinde; but the Souldiers being sufficiently expert and active in their profession, not onely wounded many of the people with their weapons, but after an hours time, dispersed the rest home to their houses: Conderosus finding, that this last and desperate attempt, had nothing at all prevailed to his advantage, rather of the contrary had procured him a great deal of more hatred and jealousie in the City, without making almost any acquainted with his designs, he suddenly retired his Forces out of the Town, and marched directly towards the King of Egypts Army: This fortunate conclusion of the stirs in Damascus , afforded the young King Orontes conveniency enough, to make what conditions he pleased with the people, since the long absence of the Court, gave them no means to vent their commodities, as they had been accustomed; so that within a very few dayes it was agreed upon, that the King setting aside all other controversies, should march into the City in an orderly triumph: Although the Princess Pantheselea , knew she had extreamly exasperated the Court, by reason of her violent proceedings, being else a Lady of excellent beauty, and admirable endowments, yet she was resolved privately to behold the Kings entry, in regard her spirit was too high to seek for a submission, scarce to accept of any when it should be freely offered to her choice: To this purpose she put her self in a secret window in a friends house: In this posture, when she looked steadfastly at the gallant Troops bravely mounted as they past in ranks, at last she saw young Ascanius in such a becomming manner upon a cole black Horse, being the onely person, that had contended equally with her Brother in the field, that her proud heart began at the instant, a little to descend to the contemplation of his perfections: As his beauty was more manly then feminate, so was his apparel so well suited to his body, as if nature had contrived it for the best advantage to youth and greatness; he wore a large plume of white feathers on his head according to the Syrian manner, which gently waving with the winde, added more grace to what was sufficiently graced already: His sword was fastened to his side by a short hanger, all set over with pearle and other precious stones: his shoulders were covered with the scarf that Queen Andromida had given him before the Battle: Another plume also adorned his Horse in his fore-top, which with other Ornaments suitable to his pride and courage, made him seem to the beholders, as if he knew how to use his trapping to the best profit of his Master and himself: It was thought strange by many, how Ascanius could have so perfect a Courtly breeding, having never before his journey into Syria , been out of the Kingdom of Lydia ; but as his youth never wanted the education of a Prince, so since his confinement, he supplied the defect, by the continual reading of gallant Histories, wherein the truest behaviour and morality was to be learned: I say, as Pentheselea beheld Ascanius with a certain kinde of delightful envy, seeing him yet but a far off, so when he approached near the place where she stood, as if the Gods intended a conversion of her thoughts from a spiteful malice to a gentle consideration of his vertues, it was his fortune to make a stand just against her window; when his Amber Hair playing at that instant gently with the winde, gave her time enough to contemplate, what now she began to affect, if not violently to desire: This leasure also gave him conveniency enough in the view of the people, to command his horse to some actions, that might most take the multitude; so that his Horses handsome corvets, with his moving of his body from one side of the street to the other, in a graceful obedience to Ascanius directions, more and more still enflamed the Ladies thoughts towards the young Prince; insomuch as at last, she was forced to cry out, that she feared the Heavens had an intention to do her Honour some injury, since they not onely brought to her view but her consideration, that very person that had been the greatest obstacle to her Brothers prosperity: I will not call these expostulations love, yet properly they were to be esteemed likings in a high nature; insomuch, as though the shew began to pass away, Pentheselea desired yet to be better satisfied. The King presently went to the great Temple of the City, to offer sacrifice to the Gods, for the prosperous success of his affairs, not onely in being received with triumph into the Town of Damascus , contrary to his expectation, but also in regard he found the peoples joyful acclamations accompanied him freely all the way that he went: Upon his arrival (after some few ceremonies performed according to the custom in offering his chief Standard as a Trophee of his victory) he commanded the Priests to consult the Oracles about his future happiness; whereupon was made variable interpretations, since the nature of prophesies, for the most part, are never rightly understood until such time as they come to be effected; and therefore of small benefit to our humane condition: nevertheless it is not to be doubted, but all their sayings sufficiently flattered young Orontes: when all was ended of divine worship in the Temple, the King with his whole Train, proceeded to take possession of his own Palace, out of which for some time he had been kept, by the interest of Conderosus with the common people, whose natures are as variable as their conditions uncertain; as it were appearing with one breath to be both Traytors and good Subjects at the same instant: Presently he gave order, not onely to have his Court furnished with all youthful and noble recreations, for his own delight and the Ladies belonging to the Queen his Mother, but also commanded a Statue to be erected, in memory of Prince Arethusius , who had by his noble industry laboured a peace for the City.  Statues are the best Records for memory, And this shall serve us for a Deity; For Gods at first did but on earth invent Morality, which mischiefs should prevent; And Arethusius did this City save, When otherwise each man had been a slave: Since all we know were guilty of the sin, That pride and one ambition plung'd us in, Henceforth we'l offer Incense to this Shrine, And pray Orontes pardon for our crime; Whereby posterity may learn to know, The duty of themselves; us grateful show. Whilst the glorious Court of Orontes was employed in those Triumphs that belonged to his conceived prosperity, Conderosus made not onely conditions with the King of Egypt , to become General of his Army, in the Countrey of Pamphilia , but with those Forces presently marched towards the frontiers of Syria: When he was encamped, he sent defiances to Mazarius , and the Queen Andromida , and also gave intimation to Damascus , to cast out many Libels and Papers, scandalous to the Government of the Kings Councel: Although Conderosus appeared yet at too far a distance, to do much hurt to their persons and proceedings, neverthelesse it was thought convenient, to give as much stop to his insolency as was possible: To this purpose it was decreed, that the Kings General called Turinus , should with all the Royal Army advance towards the quarters of Conderosus: In these Troops young Ascanius would needs march also, whose nature was much more addicted to Martial Discipline, as I said, then to Court dalliancies, however his Beauty claimed the greatest prerogative could be imagined, in the Academy of Love: After this, both Orestes the Kings Uncle, and Pentheselea , the Sister of Conderosus , were strictly charged within a few dayes to avoid the Town. The greatness of Pentheselea's heart would not at all suffer her to ask pardon for her rashness, much less own any manner of love to the Prince Ascanius , though her private discourses would oftentimes acknowledge his perfections; however it was thought she was sorry to be banished the Town, as much for that particular, as any other of what nature soever: 'Tis true it cannot be denied, but that her fortunes, and other excellencies of nature, merited the addresses of any Prince of Asia to her person. Thus I say, the affairs of Syria remained; Orontes gallantly triumphing in his brave City of Damascus , whilst of the other side Conderosus made his compacts with the King of Egypt in his Country of Pamphilia , to vex and undermine the Syrian Monarchy: These Transactions gave sufficient conveniency to Hyacinthia the Queen of Lydia , not only to consider her own particular concernments, but to bethink her self also of those promises she had made her base Brother Candalus , when she was entertained at his House in the Forrest, whereby he might be again established in his possessions: To which effect, she became an earnest intercessour to her Royal Nephew Orontes , to recal Candalus into the Countrey; and by her powerful perswasion, she not onely obtained his restoration, but upon his arrival, he was made one of the chief Commanders of Syria , notwithstanding he had been for many years banished, by the powerful endeavours of his mortal Enemy Philostros . Although these successes and prosperities raised the great Syrian Court, to the highest period of glory could be imagined, in the wavering opinions of the uncertain multitude, yet many of the better sort of persons, were still something fearful of the proceedings and interest of Conderosus ; as well in regard of his own alliance within the Kingdom of Syria , as for that he had made a most strict accord with Sorastros King of Egypt , that no general peace should be made without his particular satisfaction: To prevent all these threatning dangers, Orontes and Andromida , not onely commanded their general Turinus , with a brave Army to guard all those frontier places, that bordered upon the Countrey of Pamphilia , but gave order also, to have the people in Damascus that were any way suspected to be of the same faction with Conderosus , to be secured according to occasion, by several guards of Souldiers belonging to the Court. Whilst the State of Syria made these provisions, for the better defence both of the King and Kingdom, one Meleander a valiant Myssian Commander, came suddenly to the Palace, that was designed for the particular accommodation of Hyacinthia ; upon notice given of his arrival, he was presently brought to her presence: After he had kissed her hands with something a sorrowful countenance, and performed other ceremonies belonging to his own duty and her dignity, with tears in his eyes he delivered himself in this manner: Madam, said he, as I must needs blame my own want of courage, to appear before so wise a Majesty as your self, with such humane sorrows and distractious, that you now see me express, which I would have onely attributed to the weakness of my natural imperfections, rather then prove disheartnings to any of your company; so of the other side, knowing your vertuous minde, to be fully furnished with every heroical faculty, needful for your Estate and Dignity, I rather chuse my self to be the relater of the unfortunate story I am to tell, then employ any person (how near your trust soever) to be my Deputy in this unwilling office. The Queen, however she seemed to entertain the expectation of the relation, with a kinde of a pale and trembling countenance, not knowing what his words any way intended, yet considering the company that was about her, especially those of the Syrian Nation, whom she was unwilling should be testimonies of her troubled fear, told him, that as she knew she was born a great Kings Daughter, and married to another of the same rank and quality, which were sufficient motives to keep her from all dejection and poorness of spirit, so did she hope the immortal Gods would comply so far with her trust and confidence in their mercies, as not to suffer her to fall into those inconveniences (by what disasters soever) that might either prejudice her own faith, or destroy their Worship in her resolutions: wherefore she bad him go on according to his intention, in letting her know the worst truth he could tell in any kinde, either concerning her self or Husband, if at all it was necessary to be related, for the benefit of Lydia or Myssia ; and the rather, as she said, in regard she knew him to be a Souldier, that was acquainted as well with profitable counsels in times of peace, as with eminent dangers in accidents of war: Meleander having received these encouragements from the Queen resolutions, which appeared alwayes to be mingled with a constant and noble fortitude, after he had for some space wiped his eyes, to give the freer passage to his words, and also paused a time for the better recollection of his memory, in those passages that were to be related, he uttered this discourse, that seemed to taste more of a sad gravity, then to affect any way eloquence of phrase or language: With this confidence then be pleased to know great Queen, said he, that as soon as Arranus , our great Lord of Myssia , had received your commands, as also being encouraged from other intimations of the Syrian State, to raise Forces for the Kings releasement, then and since detained a prisoner in his Kingdom of Lydia , (which is now in a manner reduced totally under the power and jurisdiction of the Senate) he presently assembled together, not onely his own friends and kindred, but made this speech to the great councel of the Myssian Nation. If the consideration of our Princes captivity, with the miserable separation of his family from his presence: If the injuries done to Gods and men by his oppression, be not motives of sufficient force, to perswade our allegiance to his service and assistance, yet let the very honour of our Countrey at present call us to action: Shall our Records in after times speak the shame of our Nobility, because some would be over rich, and powerful amongst us? Is it not already too great a blemish to our Kingdom, that Euarchus for a sum of money hath been sold to his Enemies, without any attempt of his friends, to set him free from his restraint and confinement? What may the glorious people of Syria think of our courages and fidelities, who hitherunto with confidence have employ'd us in their Wars, if we shall suffer our King to live a Captive without drawing one sword in his defence and vindication? If we lose Syria , we forego our best gain and support; and wanting a Prince amongst us, where is the lustre of our selves? The barren mountains of Myssia you know cannot sustain the people, without constant relief from more fruitful Countreys; if we suffer Euarchus to be deprived of his Crown, whose posterity claims an interest in the Blood of mighty Orontes King of Syria , what hopes shall we have more to be entertained either in his Court, or by his Kingdom? Without which of necessity we must also be lost in the opinion of other Princes: May we not remember what plentiful benefits this poor Countrey received, during the glorious Reign of Euarchus , and what prejudice we have sustained, since his honour and dignity have been eclipsed by other powers and authority: Ah cursed be the time I say, when first the Myssian people gave ear to the enchantments of our factious Priests, supported by the envious and covetous ambition of those few Nobility, that onely for their own private interest, would enthrall all our Liberties; and render us contemptible slaves to those, that will never trust our fidelity, or value our actions: Or shall our own factions, lacking a head to govern us, make way for a general Conquest of the whole? 'Tis true, some fools among us are perswaded, to become equal sharers in the Government of the rich Kingdom of Lydia ; but how that crafty Senate can be so couzened by our fancies, having neither the power to compel them, or wisdom to protect our selves, I do not understand? Countrey-men, I say, let us first redeem our lost credits, before we we flatter our hopes of governing others. To this purpose the readiest way is, presently to raise an Army in all Myssia , either to redeem Euarchus liberty, or gloriously to end our lives in the vindication. As this Madam, I may say, was the substance, if not the particulars of Arranus speech; so did most of the Company without any contradiction approve of his advice; but in the interim Argylius , whose endeavours had ever been to contend with all violence, against the prosperity of the Royal Family, went presently to the factious Priests of our Nation, and told them, that if the Myssians did begin a new war with the Senate of Lydia , upon any pretentions whatsoever, the whole Countrey would not onely be endangered by the contention, but themselves of necessity must forgo part of their new jurisdiction: After they had received these impressions from the information of crafty Argylius , they began publickly to vent both their spleens and suspicions, against the endeavours and intentions of Arranus , insomuch as he was constrained, not onely in the generall to forbid their frequent declaration to that purpose, but finding the heat of their passion was no way to be tempered by mild ordinary admonitions, he caused two or three of their principal Agents, to be openly punished for their contempt and want of fidelity, both to himself and their King; although this something allayed the fury of the rest, yet Argylius and Lycius , who as it should seem, were not to be perswaded, to any conformity with those, that intended any good to the King your husband, so underhand contrived their designs with many Officers in the new Army, that as they got their chief creatures to be put in places of command, so not a few of the rest of the Captains, that weree necessarily to be imployed in the service, for want of others in our Nation of their profession; either by money or insinuations were corrupted, to prove unfaithful in their trust. As with these uncertain, though numerous Forces, we were constrained hastily to march unto Lydia , leaving our other Souldiers to follow, as they should be leavied, in regard we were expected to raise the Siege from before Cleosa , where Farezius remained; so had not Arranus made many dayes journey into the Countrey of Lydia ; (being also in every place betrayed by the common people, whose affections notwithstanding at our entrance we esteemed ours) before he was encountered by Hercrombrotus , Lieutenant General to Farezius , and in that Conflict with a far less number routed and overthrown; insomuch as the whole Army was left to the mercy of the enemy, since those traytors that had been put in command by the power and perswasion of Lycius and Argilius , were so far from looking upon their own honours, or Euarchus imprisonment, that they basely yielded up their persons to the hatred and contempt of the Lydian people; who in a most cruel and disgraceful manner, led them with the General in triumph into the great City of Sardis ; where for the present they are to expect such other usage, as the Senate of Lydia shall decree, towards their further punishment: But my self and some few others, finding that both Fortune and Treason had been against our proceedings, retyred with all expedition again into the Kingdom of Myssia , either to bring a new supply to the rescue of our Countrey-men, (many of them being yet dispersed over the Territory of Lydia ,) or else to make some head in our own Countrey, whereby the better to withstand the practices of the contrary faction, that we supposed would be over-prevalent after this unexpected overthrow: here Meleander stopt. Although the Queen seemed very much troubled, by her walking up and down the room, many turns without speaking one word; yet at last looking up at the Heavens, as if she something reproved the Gods concerning her misfortunes, or rather as it might be thought implored their assistance for the future, she bid Meleander again go on in his discourse. Meleander being thus enjoyned, added this relation to his former. After my retirement into the Kingdom of Myssia , said he, with those scattered Troops, that had freed themselves from the surprise and pursuit of the enemy, we encamped beyond the great River, that gives rather security then bounds to our chief City of Lampsacus , with intentions not onely to gather more Forces, to march again into the rich Kingdom of Lydia , but also to be able to contend if there should be occasion, with the deceitful practices of Lycius and Argylius , who we knew would be ready to take all advantages to destroy our power and the Kings interest: Thus we stood armed for some few dayes as well to expect the event of things, and to try the constitution and affections of the people; in the interim sending our desires to Argylius , which was to have his assistance for a new expedition. However our messengers quickly brought back this return, that as they found the multitude were wholly governed by the actions and discourses of some factious Priests, that onely aimed at the continuance of their own authority; so were they assured from good information, that Hercrombrotus with the best part of his Army, was already marched into Myssia , intending within a very few dayes to be personally at the City of Lampsacus. Hercrombrotus was no sooner entered the Countrey, but Argylius met him on the way with such a humility, that assured him of his own fidelity to those designs he intended, concerning the absolute peace and quietness of both Nations; and to this purpose, the general Assembly of the whole Kingdom was presently appointed to appear at Lampsacus , where not long after such decrees passed, as not onely disanul'd all the proceedings of Arranus , but command was sent unto us, and our Forces, either to lay down arms and stand to the agreements of each Kingdom, or else undergo the hazzard of another overthrow, by those Troops that Hercrombrotus had conducted out of Lydia to that purpose. When these propositions were signified to our small and inconstant Army, many varieties of opinions in an instant appeared amongst us; some desired rather to dye fighting, then any way yield to terms of this dishonourable nature, since we had not so much as the choice, to dispute our own conditions in what kinde soever, but were rather implicitely to trust the agitation of our mortal enemy Argylius , whom we knew intended no way to pleasure any of the Kings party; others again by degrees withdrew themselves from our company and assiance, as believing we would prove so obstinate in our resolutions, that they might accidentally be involved in the desperateness of our affairs, ere they had secured their persons and estates, by some treaties of submission and agreement: I perceiving these last thoughts to possess the most, and not having sufficient confidence of the rest, Argylius faction over-powering the greater part of the Army, suddenly retired from the Camp with a few other of my friends, fearing some plot else might betray us unawares, before we could in any kinde provide for our own safeties: To this purpose we sheltred our persons in the more hilly parts of our Countrey, until we should finde a better opportunity to raise new Forces, whereby again to contend with the Kings enemies; in the interim we understood that Hercrombrotus and Argylius meeting daily in secret conferences, it was in the end concluded between them, that however Hercrombrotus was perswaded to withdraw his Forces out of the Kingdom of Myssia ; yet it was desired by Argylius , that he should leave some few of his Troops behinde him, the better to enable both himself and his faction to contend against the Kings party in the Countrey; however it was much doubted, with what inward thoughts and intentions he made this request: But now Madam, that I have made your most pious and sacred ears acquainted with this fatal and most unfortunate story, I must again presume upon the invincibleness of your heroick courage, so far as to shut up the whole discourse with the relation of a Tragedy not to be parallel'd. Although again the Queen put on some kinde of amazement in her looks, at this preadmonition, as not being able to make the least conjecture what it should be; yet after a little silence she let him know, that as for some years past, she had been acquainted with nothing but misfortunes, that differed not much from the worst tragedies, in which the Gods had, as she said, given her alwayes a competent courage; so did she hope still by their assistance, to be able to sustain what worldly crosses soever, with such a patience, that might not overmuch offend them; wherefore wisht him to go on boldly, since she would be prepared for his relation. Prince Arethusius drew nearer to Meleander , by reason of this expectation, who being thus anew encouraged by the Queens words and demeanour, with a more confident countenance, he began in this manner. As Princes of noble extractions cannot, I see, be overcome with worldly accidents, they being onely intended by the Gods for trials of more inferiour people; so must your Majesty be pleased to know, that the story I have now to tell, concerns the bravest person of our Nation, whose vertues however were not more eminent, then his death deplorable; since as he suffered for the maintenance of Euarchus Crown and Dignity, so was the spleen of his enemies the more exasperated against him, because he not onely proved faithful but valiant in despight of all malice and cruelty: Gallant Monterosus , said he, must be the subject of my discourse; and with that taking a Handkerchief out of his pocket, he humbly desired pardon of the Queen, in that the interpretation of his tears of necessity gave some stop to his relation: When he had wiped his eyes, and also pawsed a short space, being as it were a little out of countenance at his own passion, he prosecuted this discourse. It hath not been I suppose, unknown to the world by some written relation, that this brave man for some time, kept the Field in the Kingdom of Myssia , against your enemies, rather by his undaunted courage, then with considerable Forces. In all which, how many acts of singular valour and true fortitude he performed in his own person, ought rather to be admired then any way disputed, by his greatest opposers; neither did he desist from the prosecution of his success and fortunes, until the Kings express Commands (his Royal Person being then under the absolute jurisdiction of the Myssian Army, for the better progress of his own affairs) caused him unwillingly not onely to lay down Arms, but to retire himself into Forreign parts, where he remained for some space in obscurity, expecting still new imployment from the various accidents happening daily both in Lydia and Myssia: At last the overthrow of our great Army, under the conduct of Arranus coming to his ears, he hasted from the Countries of Scythia , with such small Forces as he could suddenly make: After his arrival in Myssia , finding not onely all our hopes lost by the prevailing powers of Argylius , against the Kings party and interest, he was constrained with some few of his friends, to enter upon rather desperate then probable attempts, to keep life in our cause, whilst other assistances could be procured from more powerful Nations: However he did not prevail in his endeavours according to his desire, yet he marched in despight of all his enemies, unto the sight if not very walls of our chief Town of Lampsacus ; and near that place, whether so decreed by the Gods, for the more glory of his sufferings, or whether the too much precipitation of his own valour, caused him to be too forward in the attempt, of a sudden he not onely fell into an unfortunate Ambuscado of the enemy, whereby his whole Forces were dispersed and overthrown; but himself after he had endeavoured some honourable escape, whereby to perform more fortunate actions for the Kings service, was unhappily taken prisoner with some other of his nearest friends: When Argylius and Lycius were informed, both of the encounter and the success, they presently gave order for his speedy conduction to the City of Lampsacus ; where also he was orderded to be brought in a contemptible and disgraceful triumph: Against his entrance into the Town at noon day, they caused a numerous company of people to be assembled together, as it were onely to behold, and deride the spectacle: When the common executioner had bound both his hands behinde his back, and placed him without any ornament or covering at all upon his head, in a vile Chariot ordained for that purpose, (the Hangman in the interim, riding in a ridiculous manner upon the fore horse) they brought him through the streets of Lampsacus , as far as the Town-house: The great Councel of our Countrey being there assembled to behold his miseries, with the highest indignation their pride could put on for his disgrace and affliction: As soon as he came before these uncompassionate Judges of his life, they not onely called him Traytor to his Countrey, and pernicious to the Gods, but presently commanded the Executioner to put him to death in the face of the multitude, with what shame could be devised, notwithstanding his birth, quality, and courage, merited at least, those cirumstances and respects, which before that present, had never been denyed any of the Nobility of the most inferiour rank. To this purpose after he was conducted through the market-place, to a Gibbit of of so extraordinary a height, as if they intended him a spectacle of wonder, as well to the birds of the aire, as to the people upon the earth, they instantly spoiled him of his apparel, and then drew him up by the neck, to the uppermost part of the Gallowes, where he remained to the amazement and horrour of the people for many hours, until some few of his friends, with the assistance of the multitude, as it were over-glutted by the cruelty, in despight of that guard, which was appointed to be the surveyors of his execution, took down his body from the disgraceful Theatre of death, committing it presently to the funeral piles, notwithstanding the prohibitions of his mortal and inveterate enemies: And this Madam, is the full period of what I have to relate, concerning the strange, if not unhappy fate of this excellent and almost unparallel'd man. Meleander having thus made an end of his relation, the Queen in a certain kinde of melancholly smil'd, demanded of Meleander , what was more to be done for her Husbands safety and deliverance, since neither tears nor dejection at the present, could further their affairs, much less remedy Monterosus in the future. Truly Madam, replyed Meleander , the best counsel I can give is, either to solicit the State of Syria for new supplies, whereby to vindicate the Honour and Dignity of the King your Husband, as a necessary consequence also belonging to the prosperity of the Syrian Government, or else that my Lord Arethusius your most noble and hopeful Son, may with his Fathers permission, take upon him the Crown and present Government of Myssia , by whose personal countenance (I make no doubt) but all the Nobility, if not most of our common people, being inclinable as you know to have a King amongst them, will contribute their best endeavours for the establishing again of Monarchy, both in the Kingdom of Lydia and Myssia . The Queen made no answer at all to Meleander , but being informed at the instant, that Orontes the King with Andromida his Mother, were newly descended into a Garden, to take their usual recreations, commanded Meleander to wait upon her self and her Son thither: whereupon presently opening a large Belcone that directed a passage into those walks, where they met with the Royal Troop, the Queen of Lydia , with a few majestick tears that accompanied her expressions, used this language to Orontes and Andromida . If the Gods be determined said she, that all monarchy shall perish in popular ruines: nay, if vertue it self must be abolished from the face of the earth, by the predominate power of injustice and cruelty, I can yet scarce be perswaded, that the wise maximes of the Syrian Government, grounded upon the deep councels formerly of great Philostros , can be so soon blown away from the remembrance of this most glorious and yet fortunate Court; and the rather am I of this opinion, for that the late actions of Conderosus are fresh still in the memory of all the people: certainly his transactions afford sufficient consideration to avoid the like dangers, when the sparkles themselves, that proceeded from that fire, are not yet totally quenched in this horizon: It may easily be conjectured, from whence the stirs and combustions in this great City of Damascus , have had their original, seeing the Rebels of the Kingdom of Myssia , have had such prosperous success: can it be thought, that the private endeavours of winning of one Town after another, is of that consequence to the establishment of this great Monarchy, as those more solid Councels, that prevent afar off the dangers that belong to Royalty in the general, when popular factions are suffered to increase in neighbouring Kingdoms, without stop or prevention? Is it possible that Euarchus should lose his Crown, by the endeavours of his own Subjects, and not Orontes be concerned in the fate of such prodigies? Can it be imagined that Conderosus doth harbour lower intentions in his ambitious bosom (being inflamed with so high a courage) as not to attempt the same period of affairs in Syria , as the less valiant and powerful Argylius hath already actually compassed in the Kingdom of Myssia? as I may say without any fear to be suppressed, since as yet Orontes hath scarce declared his dislike of his actions, either concerning the injuries of King Euarchus , or Hyacinthia his nearest Kinswoman. As the Lydian Queen was farther prosecuting her discourse in this violent manner, Mazarius finding her complaints most touched his own proceedings, as being the chief person in authority, began (however accompanied with some complements) to reprove her intentions, not onely for her overmuch passion in the delivery of her sorrows, but that she did open her spleen in too publick an assembly, which might, as he said, preoccupate the opinions of the people of Syria , to the Kings prejudice, when as their mindes were not yet sufficiently settled towards peace and quietness, neither in the great City of Damascus , or in the other Dominions belonging to Orontes's Government. This admonition was so far from allaying the just distempers of the Queen, that she told Mazarius boldly, as she observed in his disposition, a certain inclination to favour her enemies, so was it apparently evident to all the Kingdom of Syria , in whose good and welfare she had a principal interest, that his principles were the onely reason, that continued the War between Sorastros and Orontes , which for the present distasted and grieved almost all the Countries of the lesser Asia , onely to maintain the interest and jurisdiction of his own family and faction: This language and discourse beginning to heat in this furious nature, Andromida the Queen, not onely gave a speedy stop to their farther disputation, but after she had understood the relation of Myssia , taking Hyacinthia presently apart from the rest of the company, endeavoured to perswade and pacifie her the best she could: Most dear Sister, said she, as I cannot sufficiently express my own grief for your misfortunes, in which not onely I and the King my Son, but the whole State of Syria are involved; so of the other side I must desire you to consider, how at present all our affairs are in so uncertain a condition, that it is not possible as yet to afford you that assistance we intend, which the Gods I hope within a short space will grant in some convenient measure: to this purpose you may remember, to take away every suspicion from your thoughts, how that we have not onely the great Sorastros for our mortal enemy, but the faction of Conderosus within the bowels of our very Kingdom, as a vigilant adversary, both to oppose our proceedings, and set up his own interest; and the rather is his ambition to be feared, because Orontes is not yet absolutely in a capacity to govern, by reason of his age; wherefore little assurance can be had of his Subjects fidelity and obedience to his Title and Commands: Besides you cannot but think, as the Kingdom of Syria , was never yet sufficiently furnished with Shipping for its own defence, therefore less able to contribute to your designs, that needs as you know a naval power of great strength, since your enemies are plentifully provided in that particular; so must we endeavour before we can build upon any attempts of invasion, to contract such an amity with the people of Cyprus , that may render our endeavours prosperous; which I must tell you cannot yet with any probability be effected, in regard of those stirs that have lately, so much incombered and weakened the Forces and Power of our State, in that they will not be made confident of our establishment, without some better conjecture of affairs within our own Dominion; who are people that must be bought to the King your Husbands assistance, meerly by the force, either of money or interest, neither of which defects we can any way supply, in regard not onely most part of our revenue, have been obstructed, and in a manner all our treasure spent; but these late unhappy differences between us and our people, occasioned by reason of the Kings want of years, have made his Subjects disobedient to most of his Commands. Last of all I pray be perswaded, that if we should exasperate the Lydian Senate, before we are either better provided, or other Princes are resolved to joyn firmly in the intention, of settling Euarchus again in his ancient right, we might endanger their taking part with our present enemies, perhaps to the fatal overthrow both of your and our designs; when as of the contrary, if your Son Arethusius , whilst we have leasure better to pacifie our affairs, take upon him the pretention of the Kingdom of Myssia , as your messenger from thence Meleander seems to intimate, during his Fathers imprisonment, he will be able fully to taste the affections of the people of that Nation, whilst we in the interim shall underhand, endeavour to contribute to his advantage, without any prejudice thereby contracted to our selves or affairs. This advice I give you as a Sister and a Queen, without any fiction or dissimulation in my own thoughts, as I expect the favour and assistance of the immortal Gods, concerning the prosperity of my own Son Orontes . Hyacinthia after she had remained some time in a deep muse, as it were considering and weighing Andromida's words and seeming affection, at last with a certain kinde of gratitude, that appeared to have been perswaded by Andromida's expressions and her own reasons, she returned her this answer. Most noble and vertuous Queen ( said she ) although the Gods should intend an absolute end of the Lydian Monarchy, and in that period should intirely bury all the glory due unto the living Family of Euarchus , yet must my self ever acknowledge those just obligations, which your bountiful favours have bestowed upon my condition, since I came into this Court, the place once of my birth, and more real being: And for my unfortunate Children, whose crimes notwithstanding do not render them deservedly unhappy, I can but vow them sacrifices to death, rather then any way prove deficient in courage or fidelity to the Syrian Empire. As these short Declarations I hope, may sufficiently perswade your wisdome and goodness to an entire belief of our intentions; so of the other side, I can no way doubt of your performance, when a convenient occasion shall be offered to that purpose; in which posture I must constantly remain both confirmed by your promises, and praying for Andromida's prosperity. These expressions on each side, soon parted the two Queens to their several lodgings: Hyacinthia with her Son, presently after (advising with Meleander ) assembled together their chief friends, not onely of the Kingdom of Myssia , but also of the Lydian Nation, where after a long and various consultation, it was at last resolved, that Prince Arethusius with all expedition should make a journey into Myssia , as well to try the affections of that people, as withal to take upon him the Crown and Government of that Territory, if the Nobility should prove any way desirous to entertain the design; the rather for that as he doubted not, but that his Father would be willing enough to the enterprize, being fully perswaded by Meleander , that such a resolution, was the sole means left to redeem both the Kings Crowns and Dignity. According to this determination, within a very few weeks the young Prince, accompanied by Meleander, Dedalus , (who had been Governour in the Island of Crete ) and gallant Creses , took their leaves of the Court of Syria: In prosecution of which journey, as they travelled through the Territory of Sidonia , having sent the other company belonging to the Princes train, to finde out more commoditious passages, both for their horses and luggage with Dedalus , and Meleander, Arethusius and Creses would needs visit a delightful Valley, that was fam'd by the people of the Countrey, to exceed in beauty, the consecrated vale of Tempe in Greece: They arrived near the place, about the hour of nine in the morning, when Phoebus had not yet enflamed the Firmament, with the furious agitation of his golden Chariot, when turning about upon a hill, to contemplate the rarity of the Countrey, between two equal though barren Mountains, they might behold a winding Plain, as it were circumscribed by natural Rocks of either side: This delicious Meadow, was not onely adorned in several parts, with dainty groves of wood, that appeared both luxurious and even, but a most clear river Serpent-like, seemed to entangle all those delights, that the eye could possibly take notice of; however I may say in such a modest manner, that convenient plains were left of either side, of sufficient capacity, either for building of Altars to the Gods service, or to perform other rural exercises towards the recreation of the Inhabitants: It was a long space that they dwelt upon these beauties, or rather remained in them, by the strength of their wishes and imaginations, until at length they might both hear and see, a company of brave Hounds chase a fearful Tyger, from off the tops of the neighbouring Mountains, followed by many Huntsmen all in green: As this gave, as well cause of further expectation, as present delight to the young Prince, so was it not long, before his eyes were entertained at a nearer distance, with the prospect of a Lady in Nymphs attire; her fair hair partly flowing about her shoulders, by reason of her neglectful though becoming dress, accompanied also by many others of the same sex, with guilded spears in their hands, who made haste towards a passage, as they imagined, with an intention to give the beast interruption: But at last the Savage Creature, being eagerly pursued by the Dogs, and not able any way to avoid that beautiful Ambuscado, he was constrained to yield his life, as a sacrifice, both to their pleasure and triumph; and this ending the sport, they all went to an ancient and brave Castle seated upon another hill, which seemed to view, if not absolutely command, the whole Valley of delight. As the Prince and Creses kept themselves silent, whilst their thoughts were busied in contemplating this pleasant procession, which continued until the whole company was inclosed in the Castle, so afterwards smiling one upon the other, at the strangeness of such an unexpected adventure, they resolved as Knights Errant to descend into the Valley, to enquire after some intelligence, that might give their curiosities a competent satisfaction: Upon their discent they wondered to see, how the natural Rocks in many places, being furnished with clear and sweet Fountains, could contribute so much pleasure for so long a space, without hindering at all, either the beauty or the commodity of that green pasturage, lying upon the Banks of the winding River; besides the water was bordered with flourishing Trees of that nature and growth, that notwithstanding they shaded, yet they troubled not the stream in any kinde; at the bottom whereof was easily to be perceived the yellow gravel, that appeared like some golden mineral, to enchase the cristalline element, rather by art then nature, whilst the two sides seemed to be inriched by green Emerauds: The many Altars in those Groves, confusedly dispersed in a manner every where, smoked with perfumes and sacrifices, that gave also a charming content to the scent, as well as the rest did to the eyes: But the Prince, however his youth had reason to be taken enough with these delights of the earth, yet his curiosity being more ambitious of satisfaction, he made haste towards the end of the Valley, expecting to meet with some person, that would inform him to his minde of all particulars: He and Creses had not travelled many furlongs, but they beheld a fair Temple standing by the River side, which at a nearer distance, appeared to be built of sundry coloured stones, however supported on the outward side, onely with pillars of Marble, the portico being framed of Porphire: When they came to the place, the Priests were performing their noon sacrifices; so that fear of being too great interruptions of their devotions, they entered into a certain Grove adjoyning to the Temple, expecting the finishing of their religious exercise: In the midst of the Wood, there was erected an Altar, to be ascended by many steps, and consecrated as it should seem to the Goddess Diana , for that her Statue was placed upon the Table: They had not spent much time in viewing some things belonging to the Altar, before they might perceive an aged person in a certain kinde of religious habit with a handsome youth, who came on a slow pace, in regard the old Priest was reading in a book with much attentiveness, whilst the boy carried in his hand a lighted Torch: As the Prince and Creses desired anew, to be satisfied in this other adventure, so did they conceive the best way to have the full knowledge of what they intended, was to give them no manner of impediment for a while, either by discourse or otherwise, until they should have absolutely finished all their devotions: To this purpose with their horses, they retired at some distance behinde a large Tree, that had compass enough in its bulk, to shelter them from discovery: When the Priest came near to the Altar, he prepared with a most grave modesty, all the necessary materials belonging to the sacrifice; after which he kneeled down before the Statue of Diana ; then made his prayer to her and the rest of the Gods; in a low and silent manner: which finished, he took the lighted Torch out of the boyes hand, and set fire to the victims, his eyes being all the while attentively fixed, as if not onely his actions, but his very thoughts were purely intended to no other period then the Heavens. This ended, with some other Ceremony belonging to his function, he was by the youths assistance divested again of those Ornaments used in the sacrifice; when going a little aside, he made a few other short supplications, and then prepared himself for his return, which caused Arethusius and Creses suddenly to step out from their private station, and meeting him on the way, the Prince saluted him with this language, whilst he in the interim appeared something amazed at the unexpected encounter. Father, said he, although I hope my intrusion at this time, hath not been much prejudice to your devotions, nevertheless by the rules of morality and civility, I conceive my self obliged to make some apology for my intention; and that is coming by the accident of travel into this delightful and heavenly vale; I must desire your assistance, that I may again be set right in my way, if not be further instructed by your knowledge and courtesie, in those rarities I have seen since my arrival: 'Tis true, I must confess I have been formerly made acquainted, with the natural pleasantness of this Countrey of Sidonia , to whose principal Town and Haven I am presently going, to embark my self for a speedy transportation to other parts; so that if my curiosity may not seem too great an impertinency to your better consideration, I should be most willing also to carry along with me, not onely the true understanding of this delicious habitation, but who might be the many young ladies we saw in the morning, chasing of a wilde Tyger over these bordering Mountains, with their intentions for this course of life they seem to prosecute. The Priest after he had returned the like salutations to the Prince, with other civil and fitting complements, he told him, that as he would first lead him to a more convenient place of repose, before he began any story at all, since the noon season at present seemed to afford small conveniency in the open air for discourse; so would he without any difficulty, according to his desire, furnish him with his best knowledge both concerning the Countrey, and the parties he mentioned. They had not gone together much above two furlongs through the Woods, whilst the youth in the interim lead the Princes horse, but that they beheld the delightful prospect of a most substantial building, the structure being of white stone, smoothly wrought in every part, however more pretending to conveniency and extent, then to magnificency and richness; the whole Fabrick incompassed a large Court paved with flat stone, in the midst of which was rather a pool then a fountain, for that neither statues, or scarce any workmanship of curiosity were to be seen, onely certain pipes of lead seemed to convey the clear water therein contained, to the several offices of the house, whereby the more commodiously to over-flow the whole, for the better refreshment of the inhabitants. At the gate the Priest informed Arethusius of all this, since it was prohibited for any man as he said to enter further into the place; in that onely profest vestal Virgins kept the possession to themselves upon strict rules: He told him further, that himself was the chief Priest that offered to the Gods the common sacrifice in the view of those holy women, who at such times gave their personal attendance, performing their devotions through an Iron-grate. After this he conveyed him to his own appartament a little distant from the gate; where being entered, the old Father presently called for wine and some fruits, which in truth were excellent in quality, though not abounding in quantity; which were onely provided for the Priest private collation. When they had made an end of this refreshment, Arethusius being as desirous of his promised information, as hasty to be going towards his intended journey, the Priest began his relation to this purpose. Sir, said he, I must not detain you too long with many circumstances concerning what you have desired, since they might perhaps too much prejudice your designs of haste and expedition; wherefore you may be pleased to know, as shortly as I can well deliver my thoughts unto you, that the chief Lady and Mistriss of those young women you mention, was named at her birth Pentheselea , however she hath now taken upon her the denomination of Athalanta , a Lady in like manner once accompanied by other Virgins of the same years, as a Huntress in the pleasant Valley of Tempe , and other places of the fruitful Countrey of Greece: As Pentheselea's Mother dyed in bringing her into the world, being the second Wife to the Father of one Conderosus , and Sister to Orestes our now Kings Uncle, so did she leave her the sole inheritrix (according to the laws and customs of Syria ) of a most plentiful fortune in these parts. This Athalanta or Pentheselea no sooner was made capable by her years of Court-breeding and entertainments, but our Queen Andromida sent for her to her own Palace, as well in regard of her fortune as her quality; there she remained, as I may say, rather under protection both for her person and estate, then any way at her own dispose, until her spirit increasing with her age, not onely made her thoughts covet some eminent match, belonging to Sovereignty, but in the interim to desire violently the jurisdiction of her own Lands and Endowments, though the Laws of our Kingdom did not yet seem to grant her the priviledge: She received an answer to these two particulars, that as the King and the Queen did resolve upon the first occasion, to provide her the most noblest Husband in Asia , so for her fortune (which could not be disposed of by her self, until she should come to some competent years) they would put it into the hands of Prince Orestes her nearest Kinsman, to be by his care and affection, preserved in all things for her advantage: Although these answers for the present seemed rather to quiet her ambition, then fully to satisfie her minde; yet finding that neither of these promises were performed according to her expectation, she began by little and little (as she grew into more years) to quarrel with the Court proceedings; insomuch as at last she received from Andromida , some apparant reprovements, if not otherwhiles many underhand affronts. Nevertheless all these petty inflammations lay buried upon the matter, in a kinde of supposed obscurity between perswasion and other divertizements, until Conderosus her half Brother, began to cast about flames of Rebellion, throughout the whole Kingdom of Syria ; wherefore Athalanta having received double instigations (if not encouragements) to prosecute her exasperated discontent, both against the Queen and her Favourite; of a sudden flew from the Court to the City of Damascus . In this posture she remained for so long time, as Conderosus endeavours prevailed against the Kings party; but he being driven out of his Countrey, however she hath dives times since been earnestly invited to Court, with an absolute promise of the absolute forgiveness of all her disaffections; yet finding her Uncle Orestes will not be won, neither to any manner of obedience or compliance, as long as Mazarius Queen Andromida's Favourite governs the whole affairs of the Kingdom, she hath chosen rather to live in her own Territories like a Huntress, amongst other Damsels of the Countrey, then to bend her thoughts to any manner of agreement with the Court; which was the occasion and onely reason you found her in that posture this morning, chasing a wilde Tyger over the mountains; and the sport being finished, belike she is retited into her own Castle that you saw seated upon the Hill, having a pleasant prospect over this delicious Valley, not to be parallel'd again, I believe, through the whole Countrey of the lesser Asia ; sometimes notwithstanding she useth to descend into these lower parts, to visit this Cloister of vestal Virgins, that was first built by her Mother before her death, as the Temple without the Grove by her Father, for the entertainment of certain holy Priests, who are obliged daily to offer Sacrifices to the immortal Gods for the founders: And this, gentle Sir, is the best and truest relation I can make. Truly Father, said Arethusius , as I cannot but acknowledge my obligation to your favours, for the courtesies I have already received; yet I must again upon the same score of humanity, desire a further information, concerning the causes of Orestes present distastes, whereby he came at the first to contradict the Court proceedings. What I can say of that subject, replied the Priest, is, that two reasons are given for the discontents of that Prince the Kings Uncle; the one proceeds from that Mazarius the Queens Favourite, laid the imprisonment of Conderosus upon the procurement of Orestes , after that by order of Court he was again released; the other for that the Queen would not entertain a friend of his especial recommendation, to succeed in the places and employments of Mazarius , when he seemed to the publick view of the world, to be banished out of the Kingdom of Syria during his life; though for my part, I rather attribute his retirement, to a certain kinde of wilfull uncertainty in his own nature, since as I have heard, Mazarius ever endeavoured to give him as much respectful content as was possible, though now being pre-occupated with a contrary opinion concerning his actions, (meerly by the perswasions of some persons about him) he becomes inflamed against his person, with a certain kinde of obstinate constancy, not to be removed in his nature, by any manner of endeavour whatsoever. These discourses being ended, Prince Arethusius understanding also that the Palace of Orestes was in his way to the City of Sidon , without many circumstances, but onely a civil and short thanks for his entertainment, took his leave of the Priest, as if his haste dispensed with all other usual Complements: The Prince and Creses being both mounted again upon their Horses, having not travelled above a quarter of an hours time, towards the beaten Rode way, e're Arethusius told Creses , that notwithstanding his Attendants might with some impatiency, expect his arrivall that night, where he had appointed to lodge, yet he had so far changed his resolutions for the present, by reason of the Priests relations, that he was determined to visit his Uncle Orestes House, to try whether or no he could perswade him to any Court-compliance; if not, at leastwise, to forget in part those affronts he conceived he had received at Damascus , either by the Queens disaffections, or her Favourites greatness: It was not much above an hour before sun-set, when Arethusius arrived at his Uncles Castle, where presently mounting the stairs, (because he had a desire the better to surprize him in his retirement) he found him seated in his Dining Room, one leg over another, with a Book in his hand, on which he seemed to read very attentively; so that he was almost upon him before he perceived any body: Although Orestes were a little confounded, when he beheld his Nephew, yet at last being better recollected in his thoughts, he not onely gave him those kinde and loving respects, belonging to his quality and his own affections, but in a more particular manner then ordinary, enquired after his affairs, with the occasion of his present journey into those parts. Truly said Arethusius , as a visit to your self, (whom I so much honour and esteem) had been a sufficient cause, to have perswaded my reason to the voyage, without any other design whatsoever, so of the other side, not to lay all upon the score of my obligations to your persons and vertues, I am at present making a speedy journey into the mountainous Countrey of Myssia , where I am promised by the assistance of the Nobility, and many others of the same interest, to be elected King amongst them, by my Fathers consent, or at leastwise shall be able to procure the raising of an Army, for my Fathers advantage, if not releasement out of prison, where he is now detained by the power and tyranny of the Senate of Lydia: At these words Orestes smiled, which being over he told him, that he wondred how he could be perswaded so far as to think, Mazarius designs in putting him at present upon this enterprize, was for any other end, then to remove his person out of the Kingdom of Syria , whereby both himself and Queen Andromida his Mistress, might be the more conveniently freed from his importunities; Arethusius was something troubled at this reply, in regard it took off some confidence from his thoughts, concerning his present expedition: Notwithstanding it was not long before he returned him this answer; Uncle, said he, although the malicious practises of the world, should never so much conspire against my fortunes, as the cruel destinies have hitherunto done in my Fathers quarrel, who else could not have been destroyed, by the improbable endeavours of a few of his most contemptible Subjects; yet I am determined still, to prosecute my fates, until I either compel them to become more favourable, or my self prove the last sacrifice can be offered to their malice. Orestes being much taken with his Nephews reply, presently took him in his arms with these expressions; I must confess, said he, the Gods do more then injure bravery and justice, if they prove not altogether propitious to such attempts, wherein I promise for the now disgraced Orestes , if he ever come again into authority, to be powerfully assisting in those designs: this gave occasion to Prince Arethusius to be more particular with his Uncle, concerning the chief reasons of his discontents. Truly Nephew, said he, the extraordinary favour of Mazarius , (by whose means not onely all the Princes of the blood in Syria are despised, but our young King Orontes altogether adulterated, both in his education and conversation, when as scarce any person of worth and quality, is suffered to come near his presence) is the principal cause of my distaste; who in the interim keeps the world in troubles and combustion, whereby his Faction may be esteemed the more considerable, towards the advancement of the women of his House and Family, that are daily preferred in marriage, to the greatest matches of the Kingdom of Syria: For if once a generall peace were made throughout all the Countreys of Asia , there is no Prince but would hold it a supream dishonour to his condition also, not to draw his sword in your Fathers quarrel, being now onely hindred in that particular, by the pressing necessity of their own affairs and concernment. As many such like discourses passed that night between Arethusius and his Uncle, so the next morning very early, both himself and Creses parted from the Castle, with an intention again speedily to finde out the rest of the Company; but in the way the Prince began this disputation with Creses . Creses , said he, although I am determined to prosecute my purposes, for the redemption of my Fathers liberty, with what violence and success the Gods will give me leave; yet considering those relations that have been made unto me, both by my Uncle Orestes and others, I cannot but something doubt the real affections of Mazarius , and so consquently those of Queen Andromida , which if not effectual, must of necessity destroy my designs concerning the Myssian Nation, whither we are now going; the people for the most part having as we suppose, their chief dependency upon the Court and State of Syria: Wherefore I must tell you Creses , said he, that either the world is extreamly mistaken in this particular, or those messengers that have been formerly imployed from the Countreys of Myssia into Syria , did not faithfully execute the pretentions, for that in the very height of all such transactions, my Father was not onely betrayed by Argylius and Lycius , when he was made believe the contrary; but since this act of treachery and dishonour, (what hopes soever have been given us) we have found most of the Nobility still averse to our good: Witness the late unparallel'd act of cruelty, shewed in the death and destruction of brave Monterosus , who of all others belonging to that Nation, hath shewed himself most faithful to my Fathers service; which being well considered in every circumstance, I cannot but conclude, there is cause enough of jealousie, concerning both the intentions and proceedings of Mazarius with the Court of Syria , notwithstanding those glorious expressions they have continually offered to our ears, however never performed to our benefit in any kinde; but as you see I must still be forced as a most unfortunate Prince, to depend upon this miserable uncertainty, having little or no other refuge in the world, capable of entertaining my hopes, much less subsistance to maintain my person; which is the reason onely, that now we are about to undertake a voyage, as desperate in the execution, as hazzardable in the event, since we shall fight against assured enemies, without being assured to be assisted by constant friends. When Arethusius had delivered thus much of his inward thoughts, proceeding from those discourses, he had had the night before with his Uncle Orestes, Creses returned him this answer: Truly, my Lord, said he, as it is something a difficult matter to resolve what were best to be done in these dangerous enterprizes, when you are to put your Royal Person totally into the hands of people, who have already proved both false and unkinde to such a King as your Father, that cannot well be parallel'd for his constant love to his own Countrey-men; so of the other side, if I should say nothing at all for your farther satisfaction, you might perhaps interpret my intentions not real enough for your service: having weighed the consequences, I shall rather chuse to hazzard my opinions in the censure of others, (who perchance may not be of the same belief) then hold my peace, when perhaps I have most reason to speak, since actions once performed cannot again be recalled by any industry, and at the greatest advantage may be hoped for, can but fall out competently to our mindes. To this purpose I must say, that nothing can be esteemed at present more pretious to be conserved then your own safety, since upon it depends both your Fathers security, and you Friends fortunes, and what certainty will be had of either, if you precipitately expose your own person, not onely in some sort to the known malice and power of your worst enemies, but to the instability of an inconstant multitude, who for the most part do but act according to the dictates of a few factions Priests, that as you know must have their own ends and ambition, to be in the first place considered, before either your right, or their Countreys honour: Besides the difficulty of the work we are to undertake for the Kings advantage, having yet no Prince or State to joyn with us in the attempt, we are to make upon the Lydian power, that hitherunto hath been ever too hard for the Myssian Forces, when best united in an offensive or defensive war: Nevertheless, I will not deny, but if you be assured of the fidelity of all the Nobility in the general, the Priests depending upon them, and the people upon the Priests, some success may be hoped for according to your desire, in regard of the many discontents in the Kingdom of Lydia , by reason of the Kings oppressions, and the Subjects sufferings: However my opinion is, before you absolutely resolve to go in person into the Kingdom of Myssia , (especially for that you seem something to suspect the reality of Mazarius ) you first make a voyage into the Island of Cyprus , where young and valiant Narcissus now governs, whose affection to your cause you cannot doubt, in regard of the love he bears that unparallel'd Lady your most fair and vertuous Sister, by whose Councel and assistance, you may better prosecute your affairs; not onely for that by his means, you may be furnished with convenient shipping for your purpose, but also in regard that place is most proper, both to confer and agree, upon some terms and conditions of certainty, with the Gentry and Nobility of Myssia , that have a minde to venture their lives and estates in your service; whilst in the interim, Dedalus may be sent to endeavour some enterprize upon the affections and undertakings of the people of Crete , who in the generall (as we are informed) seem to be much discontented (if not exasperated) against the fortunes and prosperity of the Senate of Lydia ; neither in that Island want there many Myssians , both by birth and desires, that will be ready to engage with your self, and their own natural Countrey-men, in any probable way of gain or advantage. Creses , said the Prince, after he had made an end of his counsel, I thank you for this affectionate advice, since I know the motives proceed from a soul inflamed to do both my self and Father service; yet I must tell you, however we cannot resolve any thing absolutely in these particulars at present, for that neither Dedalus nor Meleander are at this accidental conference: Besides we must leave in part as you say, the direction of our affairs, to young Narcissus in the Island of Crete , whose love to my Sister Cloria (as you think) is a sufficient engagement, to render him ours as well in interest as power; withal his assistance must be sought of necessity, in regard the Kingdom of Syria is at this time (for ought we can see) engaged in a lasting war with the Egyptians ; which Kingdoms seem not now to contend, so much for glory and Empire, as whether Mazarius or Conderosus shall govern in the Court of Orontes: Although Creses were well enough pleased at these expressions of Arethusius , because they seemed to have a sufficient confidence of his own fidelity; yet he could not chuse, but fetch two or three sighs at the remembrance of the Princesse Cloria's beauty, which inwardly he adored exceedingly in his thoughts; however his discretion taught him better rules, then either to strain his ambition after such chimera's, or discover his passion to any, whereby to advance his own love, or destroy hers to Narcissus , by any endeavour whatsoever. These manner of discourses, made them for some time take no notice of the ruined and dispeopled Countrey, through which they past, until at last the Prince with more observation, asked Creses , what were the reasons of so much devastation, differing as he said so exceedingly from the other fruitful Countreys and places of Syria? What else, replyed Creses , but the cruel and unfortunate effects of the continued war, between Orontes and Sorastros? in regard these parts lie upon the Confines of both their Dominions, that renders it subject upon all occasions, to the merciless Laws and incursions of barbarous and inhumane Souldiers, who often make inrodes from Lycia and Pamphylia , belonging to the King of Egypt , into this part of Syria , as of the other side the Syrians not seldom visit those Territories, and so interchangeably take Towns one from another, according to accidents and opportunity; whilst in the interim the Countrey people are not onely made miserable by these contentions, but their very Landlords (by reason of extraordinary Taxations) cannot receive their Rents, whereby to be able to maintain a Port answerable to their births and callings. The Prince answered him, that the condition was very unfortunate, when neither side in the end could gain by the bargain. And this, said he at the present, renews to my memory, the consideration of the Kingdom of Lydia , brought into the same state and condition by the unruly ambition of a few persons, whose intollerable covetousness at the first, joyned with their violent desires, to come in places of office and command, envying the prosperity of my Father and his Kingly Dignity, have broken all the Laws both of God and man, onely to change that manner of Government, which could never be mended, scarce equalled through the world in its constitution. And yet replied Creses , the people are still so blinded with their extravagant conceptions, that however they are sure to be brought into the most absolute slavery can be imagined, (be who will Conquerours) they feed their fancies and hopes with obtaining in the end such a liberty, as shall render their thoughts and imaginations fully satisfied: Certainly said Arethusius , as the vulgar must needs have some other hidden aims in their intentions, then barely the envy and hate of Monarchy in the general, so of the other side it is most probable, that their Counsellors and Directors cannot also be without other particular designs, concerning their own profit and advancement, since it is likely their sense and desire onely of the common good, (as they pretend) carries not their actions and thoughts to such violencies. Truly, replyed Creses , I do not finde them such mortified people, as the first Heroes were in the beginning of the world, since there may be noted in their dispositions, not onely extream avarice almost past all example, but also such a melancholly pride to predominate in their natures, that they in a manner spight all eminency in others, that are not of the same quality and faction, which renders them for the most part cruel and unjust beyond measure: And if I may descend to more particulars, I shall say, that as the common people of Lydia at the first took part with the Senate, in opposition to the Kings authority, onely to be possessors of their Landlords Estates, without paying any Rents or duties for them, being made believe they should become of equal esteem and power with the greatest persons; so now those Rulers themselves, having sufficiently made use of the peoples assistance, towards the compassing of their own ends; which was absolutely to govern as they pleased, begin absolutely, not onely to cast off the vulgar importunities, but endeavour by all the violent wayes can be imagined, to leap into other mens fortunes how unjustly soever: And this in summe is the whole scope of their designs, let their pretentions of Religion and Reformation be what they will. Although I am easily perswaded, said Arethusius , that these are the principal ends and designs of most of the Senate at Sardis , yet my youth and experience have never yet (to my remembrance) been made acquainted fully with the causes, that either lost my Father his authority amongst the vulgar, or made so many of the Nobility and Gentry take part at the first with the Senate, without which it had been unpossible in so short a space, to have parted him from his jurisdiction. Truly Sir, replyed Creses , as I must impute a great cause of the ills, to a certain kinde of untoward predomination of the fates, by which the actions of men may be sometimes governed, beyond any power of resistance; since if the King your Father had ever got the least intire victory over his enemies, during all the time of his contention, he had not been now a prisoner; so if I may speak either my thoughts freely, or deliver without smoothing the opinions of other persons, some other reasons in part may be given also for his restraint and misfortunes: for when the Court of Lydia , enjoyed a prosperity almost beyond all example, the Nobility and Gentry of the Countrey, were so far from receiving satisfaction for their services and duty, that many of the petty Courtiers, not onely apparently contemned and derided their attendance, both in a ridiculous and uncivil manner, but in their own particulars, were so given to cheating and covetousness, that scarce any sute of Law could be proceeded without their solicitation or satisfaction: This I must needs say, extreamly alienated the hearts of the better sort from the Kings particular, however himself, was no way guilty or privy to these corrupt and insolent practices: And yet these ungrateful men in a manner were the first, that quitted the Kings service and interest, upon his declining condition: The next oversight committed in the Government it self was, that the King was put on to lay new impositions upon the people, without being prepared with a Royal Army; or at leastwise furnished with competent Troops of Souldiers, to be ready in all occasions, to suppress their disorders and insolencies; since it is unpossible but by such means, either to make them pay what may be demanded, or to restrain their violences in the gathering of the money: besides, something of these late disaffections, were conceived to proceed from the pride and indiscretion of the Flamines , with other arbitrary Judges, who rather went about to determine causes, in a high way of Court- Prerogative, then according to right and indifferency, concerning every mans due and condition, according to the Customs, and Fundamental Laws of the Nation. By this time it being almost sun-set, and the Prince finding it not probable they could overtake the rest of the Company, since the Town where they were appointed to lodge, was at something a far distance, as they had been informed by the old Priest, he resolved to retire into a small Village not many furlongs from the place where they then were: being entred into one of the houses of that scattered habitation, and finding it very barely furnished with all manner of commodities, towards his entertainment, notwithstanding he pretended himself to be but onely a private Gentleman, travelling towards his own Countrey; whilst Creses was providing meat for the Horses in an out- building, he asked the people many questions concerning their present poverty and apparant misery: Truly Sir, said one of them, as in the general we may thank the Gods, and our own fates, that have placed our habitations under so unfortunate a Region, so in the particular, must we impute our sufferings to two causes: The one to the war so unhappily begun between Orsames and Sorastros : The other, in that not many years ago, some of our Countrey, not being either able or willing, to support the burthen of our continual taxations, gathered the people together in a warlike maner to resist those officers, that were sent to raise and collect the money; which not proving successful according to our intentions, we were not onely quickly dispersed by multitudes of Souldiers, but other new impositions laid on our Persons and Estates; insomuch as our small Revenues, will scarce defray the necessary expence and charge of our slavish condition; and to that purpose cannot keep our own children in our houses, but must be forced to turn them into the world at a competent age, to seek better fortunes, in that a certain proportion of payment is also laid upon each head in the family, which doth amount to more, then any one of us can well gain by any labour or industry at home. But said the Prince, we hear these payments will now quickly cease, in regard of the absolute intention of a general peace, between these two mighty Kings of Syria and Egypt : The Gods send it, said the master of the house, however this hath been the common talk for this many years, without any effects at all according to our hopes, and desires, whilst in the interim we do not onely suffer as you have been already told, but in regard our Countrey lyes upon the Confines and Borders of both the Princes Territories, we are in a manner continually troubled with the quartering of unruly Souldiers, that not seldom upon their parting from our habitations, deprive us of all we have, or can procure for many years afterward, which is the occasion, that keeps us so ill furnished of any kinde of commodity, that may give entertainment to strangers and travellers: Furthermore, by the very Laws of this Nation, the Boors are not permitted to eat any Fowl; and no Grapes in a manner being planted in these parts, we cannot give that satisfaction to those of the better sort as we desire: These were items sufficient, to perswade the Prince, to be contented with what provisions they could suddenly provide; which was a few Eggs fryed together in a pan over the fire; and for their drink, either they were to be satisfied with clear running water from the next Fountain, or else with a certain kinde of sweet liquor prest from excellent apples, abundantly growing in all the Countrey of Sidonia: After Creses and himself, had made an end of their delicious supper, they were willing to be made acquainted with their places of repose, that as they imagined, would be nothing inferiour to all the rest of their entertainment, and truly it proved so indeed, for the room where they were to lodge, was as near the earth as possible nature could place it, whilst the open windows received the fresh air from the pure heavens, without any opposition at all. In the morning, after they had rewarded the Countrey people according to their own bounty, they took their leaves of the poor Cottage, and within two dayes space arrived at the ancient Town of Sidon , where again they met with their company, who could not but something wonder at the occasion of so long a separation, though they thought it not manners, particularly to enquire after those adventures, which the Prince had designed and commanded for his own pleasure; nevertheless it was not many hours, before he himself made both Dedalus and Meleander acquainted with the discourses he had had with Creses in the journey, proceeding (as he said) from the intimations, he had received from his Uncle Orestes , which had made him fall back a little from those resolutions he formerly intended, when he parted from his Mother the Queen at the City of Damascus , until he could by better demonstrations be assured of the affections of the Nobility of Myssia ; upon whom of necessity would depend the success and prosperity of that journey; they could not chuse but approve of the reasons, and so consequently it was concluded, that the Prince should first visit the Island of Cyprus , unto which place presently might be summoned, many principal persons of the Myssian Nation, not onely to confer about his reception into their Countrey, but to provide carefully, being there, for his security: as it was determined in the first place, that Meleander was the fittest man to be sent into the Kingdom of Myssia to this effect, so was it again held absolutely convenient, that the Queen Hyacinthia , should be presently advertised of the reasons of the alteration; which Meleander himself undertook in person to perform, and afterward by Land to prosecute his journey into Myssia , whilst in the interim, Arethusius , with his two servants Creses and Dedalus , took shipping at Sidon for the Island Cyprus . Upon Arethusius's arrival at Paphos in that Island, he understood that Narcissus the young Duke, was at the present employed in a dangerous siege, before the strong and rich Town of Salamnie , that seemed in some sort to rebel against his Authority and Jurisdiction. As this unexpected intelligence gave his thoughts some trouble, in regard of his own occasions, that seemed in a manner to depend upon the fortunate success and prosperity of that Prince, so after he had dispatched Creses with Letters to Narcissus , to give him notice of his arrival in the Island, one day as he was walking for his delight by the Sea-side, accompanied by many Magistrates of the Town, he was informed by one of them in this manner, concerning the reasons that caused the present differences between the said Town and their young Duke. My Lord, said he, as I shall not need to trouble you with the relation of that admirable story belonging to the loves, between Eumenes and the Lady Eretheria , our late Dukes Daughter, which may appear rather a Romance then reall in every particular, so shall I give you as near as I can a true account of our affairs, since the death of the old Duke her Father, and consequently the occasion of our present troubles and discontents. To this purpose your Highness must give me leave to say, that Narcissus being settled in the Offices and Commands of his Father, by the seeming willing consent of the people of this Island, it was not long before they began notwithstanding in some sort, to change their thoughts concerning his person or authority, (but whether proceeding from the inconstancy of their own dispositions, or being incited thereunto by the late unhappy changes in the Kingdom of Lydia , I will not say:) so that after a peace was made with Sorastros King of Egypt , by which means, a free and flourishing Trade, was bestowed upon the Island of Cyprus , almost through all the known parts of the world; the Subjects were perswaded wantonly to bethink themselves of a greater liberty of Government, then was any way convenient for the good and welfare of the Countrey, either in the general or particular. To this purpose the great and rich City of Salamnie being best able, and so consequently most proud, was the first place that made question of our young Dukes Authority and Jurisdiction; insomuch, as first privately, and after openly in most things they contradicted his will and commands, pretending that as now the Egyptian wars were absolutely at an end, and therefore no more need of a supream Governour over their Persons and Estates, so might it be feared, that their Duke Narcissus in process of time, with the help and assistance of the Souldiers being wholly under his power, (though paid intirely by their purses and industry) might be so far perswaded at last to their disadvantage, as to convert their endeavours towards the creating of Narcissus sole Monarch of all Cyprus , which was never enjoyed in effect by any of his predecessors: Besides they alledged, that already many of their ancient Rights and Priviledges had been lately detained from them, by the extraordinary interest and usurpation of their new Duke, whereas his Father had ever shewed himself onely obsequious to their Command and direction, which made them again desire to be governed by the known Laws of the Countrey, or else some general Assembly to be chosen, and appointed to that purpose from amongst the people. Although these things for some time proceeded but to disputes, without any action at all of hostility; yet Narcissus our young Duke, finding to what end tended their discourses, privately gave order to have most of the Troops belonging to the Army, ready prepared for a sudden march, whilst in the interim he caused divers propositions to be sent by Commissioners to that great and rich City, with some kinde of probability notwithstanding of a perfect reconciliation, since their chief objection was, that either Narcissus intended to be absolute Monarch of the whole Island, or else would speedily deliver over the Government, to the power and jurisdiction of Orontes , great King of Syria , whom the people as much hated as their own naturall Lord Sorastros . In fine, Sir, not to detain you over long with impertinent and tedious discourses, our Prince finding that he could not make or procure to himself just obedience from them, by reason of their turbulent endeavours and under- hand practices, suddenly with most of his Army, that he had for the present caused to be in a martial readiness, surrounded their Walls, to their no small amazement; as it should seem with an intention to recover that by force of arms, which he could not perswade them unto by any fair means or entreaty. But he had scarce time given him for this discourse, much less to proceed farther, before they were both advertized, that Narcissus the Duke, accompanied by many of the Nobility of the Countrey, was not onely come from the siege of Salamnie , having left the Army, under the Command of his Brother-in-law Eumenes , but was at the present marching upon the Sands, to give Prince Arethusius meeting and entertainment; when Narcissus was within sight of the Prince, as if nature had instructed him in that reverence he was to pay his dignity, he cast himself from his Horse with such a haste, as easily demonstrated what an humble heart, his intire affections to the fair Princess Cloria had created in his bosome: Arethusius of the other side, observing every rule of civility, as well as considering the extraordinary need he should have of Cyprus assistance, met him in the half way, where they both presently embraced, with such seeming ties of love and friendship, as if a long continued acquaintance were but again to be renewed in their intentions, although never before they had seen each other. Thus I say in circling one another with their most noble Arms, at last Narcissus , as if violently inspired by other divine considerations, again separated himself from the Princes Courtships; where at some distance looking him full in the face, he uttered these words: Is it possible, said he, that more then heavenly Cloria should be thus metamorphosed into another humane shape, onely differing in the sex and person: 'Tis true, Arethusius differed in resemblance from his fair Sister, no more then what prerogative a womans beauty might justly challenge above a manly proportion and complexion: he was tall, streight, and graceful in all his actions, and she was lovely sweet, and ravishing in every demeanor; so that the disparity appeared but in those excellencies, that God and nature intended necessarily, to make as distinctions of their kindes, not giving much advantage to either over the other, whether in the true symmetry of parts, or the well beautifying of them, to render the whole not onely admirable, but perfect: Neverthelesse, his Hair was entirely black, when as her dainty Curles were of a more declining condition, as if the predomination of heat more governed in him, as a milder and convenienter constitution in her: Arethusius was apparalled for the greater lustre of his person (in that his profession, for the future seemed to be altogether martial according to his intention) in a plain Buff-Coat, neatly fitted to his body, which rendered his shape excellent to all the company, who beheld it with no small admiration. The habit was mixed between the Syrian and Lydian fashions, whilst he carried upon his head a brave Plume of white Feathers, that so corresponded with the black natural colour of his hair, which made the opposite tinctures appear, to be surpassing graces to one another. As his Sword was hung by his side, onely in a short hanger, so wore he bandrick-wise a watchet Ribband athwart his shoulders, whereunto was fastned at the lower end a rich Jewel, containing the marks and ensigns of his order of Knighthood: Instead of a spear he carried in his hand a short Truncheon, that represented him to be a General of some Army, either in effect or desire. 'Tis true, this large description need not have been, if the glory of a youthful Majesty, were not a subject convenient for any pen or fancy: In fine, after sufficient complements past of all sides, the whole company marched to Paphos , where many dayes were spent in triumphs and entertainments, until Arethusius himself being wearied as 'twas thought with shewes, when realities were absolutely necessary for his condition, desired Narcissus , they might without any more impediments enter into consultations; neither was the Duke against the motion, for that his own Army before the City of Salamnie , in some sort needed his oversight. To this purpose, after they had spent some few dayes in private councels, with those friends they could most trust, either of the Kingdom of Lydia , or Island of Cyprus , it was concluded, that as Dedalus should again be sent into Crete , to try what party he could raise in that Countrey, in the behalf of King Euarchus , either amongst the Cretans or Lydians , to joyn with Meleander , that was gone for Myssia , to the same effect; so was it also determined, that Narcissus should presently dispatch two Ambassadours from the Island of Cyprus to the great Senate of Lydia , to expostulate with that Councel the causes, not onely of the Kings pretended injuries; but why also the Princess Cloria his fair and most vertuous Daughter, was in like manner detained under restraint, notwithstanding her innocency, could not any way be suspected of what crime soever. The two messengers that were sent, were called Cratus and Zutphnion , who being upon the Sea together, for their transportation into the Kingdom of Lydia , the water being calm enough for the conveniency of discourse, Cratus who was wholly for Narcissus , and so consequently extreamly violent in King Euarchus's behalf, entertained the time with this manner of language: I must confess said he, I cannot but wonder, why the great and now prevailing Senate of Lydia , should not be willing to yield to the propositions we are to make unto them, for the restoration of King Euarchus to his liberty and ancient dignity? when as the contrary probably, will not onely bring upon the whole Nation at the best a miserable confusion, in regard of their many factions and diversity of opinions, but in time to come, must certainly involve the people, in a lasting and continued War, since all Princes of the like hereditary command and jurisdiction, cannot suffer the now King and his Posterity, to be thus shamefully outed of his possessions; by the unruly endeavours of his natural Subjects, though now their own troublesom Wars, do not give them liberty and conveniency, for such an expedition, as I may say, tending to the safety and prosperity in the general of themselves: for otherwise the example will prove too dangerous a president in particular, to their present and future Governments and Dominions. Zutphnion with a smiling countenance, quickly returned him this answer. I do much more wonder, said he, that your consideration should want presidents in this nature, when as your own Countrey the Island of Cyprus , not long ago in a manner did the like, with their natural Lord the King of Egypt ; who contended so many years against his power and authority, (by the assistance of other Princes) until they forced him, not onely to quit all his Title and Interest within those Territories, but even constrained him to condescend to such conditions, the people would bestow upon him for his future quiet, left the contrary might have turned him out of more of his Right and Possessions: Wherefore I say, it is rather to be considered on our parts, whether the converting of the Lydian State to a popular Commonwealth, would not better advantage our Island and Trading, then to suffer it still to remain an absolute Monarchy and Kingdom? for that as by that means, it would not be subject to look over us, with too much splendour and majesty, so should such a Government upon all occasions afford us a double security; the one in lending us aid when we should stand in need of assistance, against any invading enemy, as in the other part, in corresponding friendly with our Merchants, by way of Trading and Commerce. In my opinion, said Cratus , you are extreamly deceived in both these particulars; concerning the first, in regard that the equality of honour, when each should be deemed an intire Commonwealth, would occasion many differences, and contentions over all the world, about place and preheminency in trading and the like; for that as we should esteem our selves the more ancient popular State, so would the Lydians still value their Nation, to be of more dignity and lustre, not onely in respect of their vastness in Dominion, but also for that the people had been formerly governed by a King, not inferiour whilst he ruled, to the greatest Prince of Asia ; which prerogative by way of honour and esteem, they would never certainly be willing to forego, however for their own advantages, they had altered the name of the jurisdiction. The second concerns commerce, either one with another, or both with other Nations; in which faculty, as we now of the Island of Cyprus , are reckoned too hard for all other Countries whatsoever, and at present furnish the Kingdom of Lydia , with many of their Commodities, at better rates, then they can procure them otherwise, by reason they have such multitudes of Gentry and Nobility, not at all given to trading, either by Sea or by Land, but rather live upon their Estates, and take their pleasures in the Countrey: so if that Nation should be changed to an absolute popular Government, all sorts of conditions for the most part, would remain in Towns as we do, and so by consequence give themselves to trading, to our apparent loss and hinderance; especially, seeing they are better furnished with commodious Havens then the Island of Cyprus , for the safety and coveniency of their Shipping: So that at last by this means, we should come to make but equal benefit with them of the Seas, that in a manner now remains whole at our dispose; or be outed wholly perhaps of that prerogative, by their new increasing industry in that particular vocation: Whereas I say, if they retain still a King amongst them, we shall not need to fear such a deprivation and obstruction; for that all the Nobility, and most of people, will give themselves to other imployments, in regard of so many different interests and conditions, incident to Monarchy and Kingly dignity, since the person of the Prince, must be attended and observed, rather in recreations and courtly designs of a more noble nature, then in trading and traffick, either amongst themselves or with other Nations. A second reason may be given, how that all Princes our neighbours, would become quickly jealous of the strict amity and combination, between Lydia and the Island of Cyprus , not onely in regard of the multitude of shipping in either; but also for that such flourishing prosperity, might endanger peoples obediencies in most Monarchies in Asia , with the hope of the same pretended liberty, and by that means be incited either to invade us with joynt and powerful Forces, or else absolutely deny us the benefit of trading in all their Dominions, without which, we of the Island of Cyprus could not possibly subsist, seeing that it is very well known, we are but the common porters of other Nations: But said Zutphnion , although your arguments are very strong, to perswade my belief to be of your opinion, yet I cannot but think, the Island of Cyprus being united in one Common-wealth, with the large and rich Countrey of Lydia , we might not onely become such prevailing masters at Sea, that all other Nations would be constrained, even to beg trading, if not assistance at our hands; but also would not know else, how to vent their own native commodities: Besides, we should by this means procure to our selves, the liberty of fishing upon the Lydian Coasts, which benefit we can scarce be without, as well to feed, as to set on work our people of the inferiour rank and quality: Well replyed Cratus , notwithstanding these may be some motives, to perswade a firm union between both Nations, yet the inconveniency that would happen to our Island thereby, cannot be well conceived; and the rather, for that it was never seen, that two Commonwealths of equal power and greatness, continued many years in a certain friendship and amity, since not a few accidents would happen daily to set us at odds: Besides the continual endeavours of all other Princes to that purpose, which probably must render the quarrel so unreparable at the last, that of necessity one of the two Countries, if not both, should perish by the violence of the contention: But however said he, you know our imployment at present, is grounded upon other designs, which is to treat about the redemption of the King of Lydia ; so that let us not any way frame our thoughts and endeavours to any other purposes, much less to comply with his enemies desires. After this short disputation between the Ambassadours, it was not many dayes before they landed in Caria , and so by consequence were soon conveyed to the great and rich City of Sardis , where the Senate of Lydia kept their Assembly: Within a weeks time they were admitted to a publick audience, at what time Cratus in the Grecian language made this oration. Although we bring health and recommendation from the people of the Island of Cyprus , to the Assembly of this Kingdom of Lydia ; nevertheless, we cannot but complain to see your Councels, not onely authorized without a King, but the mildest of those Princes that ever ruled your Countrey, at the present to be detained a prisoner, when as almost all the Nations of Asia , seem to remain scandalized, if not enraged at the strange example: Perhaps you will tell us, that it is against the laws of correspondency, for neighbouring jurisdictions, to meddle with the actions and proceedings of each other; especially when themselves are no way concerned therein. 'Tis true, I must confess, it hath not been the custome of former times; yet of the other side, when we consider what prejudice this president causeth amongst your own people, and the general distraction it hath made in the world, by way of commerce and trading, give me leave to perswade you to other considerations, or else to declare our own dissatisfaction; for as in the first place it is to be doubted, what power you have over your King, so in the next it is to be enquired after, whether you can properly be his Judges, be his pretended crimes never so obvious to mankinde, since no such conditions seem to be annexed to the nature of any Government: If his faults be doubtful, his Tryal ought to be before an uninteressed auditory; and if he be innocent in the sight of the immortal Gods, what prejudice have you done his person? wherefore if our endeavours may procure belief, and our words perswade reason; you shall endeavour to compound differences by some gentle Treaty, whereby he may be won again to have confidence in your intentions, by which means you shall more justly obtain your desires, to the perpetual felicity, perhaps of your Nation; when as of the contrary, if you prosecute this rigorous course with your King, you shall distaste, if not amaze all the other Princes of Asia , of the like interest and dignity; who however for the present, they may in some sort seem to wink at your proceedings, in regard of their own pressing occasions, yet in after times, when the occasion shall prove more opportune, they will not onely hate you for your injustice, but be afraid of your intentions, concerning their own particulars. I say, be your pretensions what they will, yet it is better to perswade love and compliance from your King, then to compel and extort conditions from his prerogative, since the one may win his heart towards your particulars, when as the other will but force his person and not his minde to your satisfaction, at last perhaps to the prejudicing of your whole Nation, both by foreign invasions and domestick troubles. When Cratus had made an end of this speech, they told him, that as they had no desire to have any difference with the Island of Cyprus , but rather were ambitious to keep a friendly correspondency with their Government, so of the other side, not at all were they to be instructed in their duty, by any other Countrey or power whatsoever: Besides, they wisht him to remember, but the proceedings of the Island of Cyprus not many years since, with their natural Lord and Master the King of Egypt , which perhaps might render them better satisfied, concerning their present transactions with their Prince Euarchus: but however, Cratus offered to make some reply, they not onely refused any more disputation upon that subject, but told him, that their own Councels, and not any words of another, were to direct the resolutions of the Lydian people. When the Ambassadours in this manner, were parted from the Senate, these following discourses and orations passed in the Assembly, the first that spake was one Fynus . Although the Gods, said he, have given us innumerable victories, against those that would have opposed our designs, by reason of which in some sort, we may presume upon a future prosperity; yet if we should now continue our Swords drawn in defiance of the peoples liberty, when no enemy seems to appear to contradict our actions, we might not onely be esteemed tyrants to the whole Kingdom, but divulge our selves to have false intentions to all the world, in having at the first pretended to have taken up Arms for our own defence, and the Subjects rights, and now when we have overcome all those difficulties, whereby every suspicion is laid asleep, we should still prosecute wayes of contention and hostility, which certainly cannot be excused in any kinde, since our King is now a prisoner amongst us: Wherefore seeing that the ancient and laudible constitution of this Nation, will admit of no binding and just laws to be made, without the free consent of our natural Prince, whose misfortune probably at present must make him agree to any thing we shall desire, my opinion is according to the propositions of the Ambassadours of Cyprus , we make new Addresses to Euarchus , whereby our actions may become the more justifiable to forreign States, as well as the better to satisfie our own people at home, by which means we may not onely be a great deal quieter in our thoughts, but the Souldiers by a well settled peace, being disbanded, who begin already to be too insolent in prescribing us rules to govern by, the Subjects shall be altogether freed from their fears and taxations. Scarce had he made an end of this oration, but another person of the contrary faction in the Senate, rose up from his seat in great fury, and used this language. If this Senator, said he, that last spoke, had either honour in his disposition, or consideration in his thoughts, he would never have made motions so much to the Armies loss, and the peoples disadvantage; for we that have now Euarchus in our power by a just Conquest, should again voluntarily become subject to his jurisdiction, we might again hazzard Lydia's liberty to another destruction, and rather by that foolish pitty, stir up his cruelty, to some fatal revenge against our persons and posterity, then any way convert his will, whereby to assure us from further mischief: No Gentleman, said he, let Euarchus instead of being again placed in his old Throne and Dignity, to recover a new tyranny over our lives and fortunes, be brought suddenly before some tribunal, there without partiality to give a just account, for those offences he hath committed, against the trust that was commended to his charge, whilst in the interim, the poor Souldiers may be rewarded out of his Estate, who have merited the greatest trophies that any glory can produce. After that this bold speech was delivered in the Senate, which shewed there was in the company, not a few of the same interest, they for a pretty space beheld one another; with such distracted countenances, as if they were so far from speaking their mindes, that they durst scarce think their own thoughts, till at last one more valiant or less considerate then the rest, made this sharp reply. Truly, said he, as I cannot but note an unworthy terrour in most of this Assembly; however for no other cause as I conceive, then for that Violence rather spake, then Reason dictated; so on the other side, if I should be now silent, when not onely Honour but Religion seems to suffer in a high nature, I could never satisfie my self with the omission: Wherefore in the first place, I do conjure the immortal Gods, to give me at present some powerful eloquence, to perswade your hearts to those actions, that are brave and honest; and after that, I must also implore their affiance to allow you such resolutions, that may defend this Kingdom from slavery and oppression. To this purpose, Gentlemen consider I pray, if your wills be not altogether corrupted, or your senses out of their right stations, that a new treaty with the King, is the onely means to keep us from a miserable confusion; since without it, neither the fundamental constitutions of this Kingdom can be maintained, or we lacking those just rights, can claim any certain property in what we have: Why should we now be drawn from our former resolutions, (at leastwise professions) by any new interest whatsoever? which was rather to convert Euarchus , then to destroy our selves as well as him, since by such an inconstancy, we not onely proclaim our own falshood through all the Countries of Asia , but even lay open this very Kingdom of Lydia , to a probable invasion by other Princes, who could no more trust our intentions after this, then be in love with our actions for the present, in that there would be left no hope to all people, any longer to be confident of our purposes, when as they finde we keep no manner of faith with our own King: Let it suffice I say that we have already too much injured the Gods, by that strong violence we have used against that authority, that first gave us power to assemble in this place, without further prejudicing the Kingdom, by wanting the approbation of him, that hath in his person sufficient right, not onely to pardon us for all those things we have done amiss, but may easily by his willing ascent, crown both our desires and endeavours with a full and ample justification, whereby to render our posterity happy in after ages, as our own persons for the instant: It is true, we pretended at the first, a certain kinde of necessity for our taking up Arms against our Prince, which however, being fully granted, according to those pretentions, yet nevertheless, when we shall now refuse him to come unto us, having absolutely conquered his obstinacy in that particular, we cannot but too much divulge our own hypocrisie to the world, if that motion shall not be entertained, since the late slaughters that have on both sides been committed, were built upon no other ground and basis, correspondent to our many professions, as well private as publick, which I conceive, if not prevented by more moderate proceedings, may in after ages rise up against our actions to all eternity. No sooner had he made an end of this general well esteemed speech, but many of the contrary faction cryed him down with a kinde of furious violence: Some said he shewed himself a traytor to the liberty of his Countrey: Others that he was inwardly an enemy to the benefit of the Souldiers, who had so courageously ventured their persons, in the defence of the Senate of Lydia ; neither wanted there a third sort that affirmed, that Euarchus had already bribed his intentions to his party and concernments: which continued the whole assembly for some space in a miserable confusion: But at last the noise being something appeased, one of the company with a sad countenace, and a cholerick brow, rose up from his seat, and made this sharp oration against him. O you Gods, said he , do the rights of Euarchus now again come, not onely in question, but in competition with our religious endeavours, in which contestation, we have made as many deep pools of innocent and guiltless blood, as would have drowned in a manner, all mercy upon the face of the earth, from the very thoughts, much less hopes of men: for my part I conceive, the breath of our complaints hitherunto, should rather have driven our injuries into some remote place, to converse onely with Tygers and Monsters, then to be any more renewed to our disadvantage, much less to be countenanced in this House, by those that until now, we deemed to be of our own party and interest. Must the expecting people after all their labour and expence, fall back another time under the loathsome yoke of their former bondage? did we not alwayes assure their confidence, when they fought with scars and wounds upon our score, that the supreme jurisdiction of this Kingdoms Government, rightly appertained to their ancient inheritance, and now shall we unsay (when all those dangers are past) that no such priviledge belongs either to their persons or condition? If needs we will have the same King and Laws, let us also put on other resolutions, and still keep on foot with a slavish patience, our old miseries and oppressions, since it is unpossible the nature of Euarchus can be changed into more gentleness, when as the thoughts of his present punishment, shall alwayes whet on his spleen to greater revenge, as his power doth increase in his own opinion and imagination. For my own particular, I shall wish, nay I implore all the Deities of Heaven, that he may still be kept enchained in this captivity, if not encompassed round about with greater securities, rather then gain more strength, lest he become fatal to all, that either we or ours, can call happiness in this world. No, no Gentlemen, said he , to make a full and perfect Catastrophe of the highest injustice can be desired, or we be in any capacity to grant to our future prejudice, let us here declare our selves guilty of all the innocent blood, that hath been hitherunto spilt in this quarrel, rather then by the consequence of clearing Euarchus by a new Treaty, the world should be possest, we have neither wit to preserve our own advantages, or goodness sufficient to be constant, and just in our executions, since those crimes that have been so obvious to all the earth, must needs be directed to some object, either in us or him: And certainly when he shall be at full liberty, he will never take it upon himself; wherefore must necessarily render us the subjects of his wrath, according to his own pleasure, when neither the power or the means, can be wanting in a Kingly condition, which consequently will follow, having once delivered that Sword into his hands, that had for some time chastized him for his wickedness: So that by this example it will apparently appear, we had not temper at the first to forbear the exasperating of his spleen, nor wisdom in the end to provide for our own safety; and by that means we shall be left altogether destitute, either of pitty or redress, suffering our selves to be deprived by his policy, of those triumphs our victories gained in the field: Nay, for a more absolute conquest over all our endeavours, whereby Euarchus's impieties may be entirely rewarded, let the accursed Flamins once again, not onely govern the Temples, but tyrannize over our Estates; so shall all our posterity bless your endeavours with hate instead of praises to the worlds end: If my words prevail not in your opinions, I wish these eyes of mine, may be presently closed with a perpetual darkness, that they may never behold the effects of such distempers contracted; which the Gods I know can never suffer, without casting continual plagues throughout all Lydia , to the destruction of the whole. Being now almost out of breath, he sate down in his place, which gave liberty to another Gentleman of more temper, after a little pause, also to shew his reasons of a contrary nature. Truly, said he , I might with much more reason, wonder at this mans passions, then answer his arguments, since there are few here according to my apprehensions, that seem not in their very countenances to blame his proceedings; yet because it hath been ever the custome of this great Assembly, to make objections against motions how ridiculous soever, I shall endeavour to say something, concerning those false principles he hath brought, as well for the discharge of my own conscience, as for the farther satisfaction of this judicious Court. To this purpose in the first place, I must say; whereas he puts no difference between the total suppression of the Kings jurisdiction, and gaining to our selves those Rights and Priviledges, we have all this while fought for, I shall desire him but seriously to remember, that upon the undertaking this bloody War in the beginning, we did not pretend to have no King at all, but onely to make the King we had ours, and so by consequence to reduce him to those necessities by powerful opposition, that he might willingly or constrainedly, condescend to those desires of ours, which we thought would be most reasonable and beneficial for the Commonwealth: much less did we ever intend to declare, the right of the Kingdom of Lydia to be in the common people, since if such a liberty should be granted the Subject, they might with as good a right, divest us of our present authority, as well as we the King of his power and jurisdiction; who by that means perhaps, might call us to a more strict account for our actions past, then Euarchus would have done, if he had with his Army entirely prevailed against our Forces: Again it may very well be imagined, that by such a change of Government, the whole Kingdom would be soon turned into a meer Chaos of confusion, when as at all times popular fancies should make Laws and alter constitutions, instead of knowledge and discretion; since it is well known, the vulgar are so far from having the capacity to command, that they are scarce endued with a sufficient understanding to obey: Nay, Gentlemen give me leave to tell you, that our ancestors at the first, having given away their national right to the Predecessors of the King, which time and custome ever since hath confirmed, I do not see how we can any more dissolve that knot of obligation, then the people can again unchuse us, from having authority to sit in this place to make Laws: So that I say, it might be rather esteemed in us an impious madness, then any wise providence, when we finde Euarchus would correspond with our intentions, not to entertain and embrace his offers with open armes, whereby we should hold those priviledges obtained, in the view of all Asia , both by love and right, whereas of the contrary, we may perhaps be esteemed rebels to our Prince and injurious to the Gods, which opinion being created in the mindes of men, we can probably be neither safe from forreign invasion, or at home from continual faction: Besides you may remember, with what solemn conjurations never to destroy Monarchy, you envited the Myssians into Lydia to your assistance, when the Kings victories seemed totally, both to prevail and triumph over all your endeavours, which again was renewed by many protestations, when after a long contention they were perswaded, to deliver the person of their Prince into your hands and custody, being overcome onely by the double power of both Nations; all which being considered, let us either entertain this new treaty propounded with the King, or resolve to become greater slaves to some other jurisdiction, then ever he could have made us by any pretended tyranny: So shall we not onely correspond with the Ambassadours of Cyprus in unity and friendship, but convert our Prince Euarchus to be confident of our intentions, whereby the Kingdom will become settled and prosperous: And last of all, we may hope to render the immortal Gods propitious in the future, to those things that shall any way concern our actions and affairs; which being said with tears in his eyes, he again sat down in his place to expect the event. After this speech, one might have beheld, variety of changes in the countenances of the whole Assembly: some with chearful looks, seemed abundantly to approve of those reasons he had delivered in his oration: Others again appeared to be something doubtful, what might be the issue and event of their Councels, since they were fearful of the Souldiers determinations; whilst many of the contrary faction with sowre brows, threatned yet a hazzardable if not a fatal conclusion: however at last after sundry other disputations (which had taken up the greatest part of the day) it was decreed, forthwith to make new Addresses to the King, whereby if it were possible, to end all contentions in loving and obedient conclusions; at leastwise so pretended in the general, though many were observed notwithstanding, not to clear the clouds of their inward discontents at these resolutions: To this purpose, the Priests were commanded to offer sacrifices, throughout most of the Temples in the City of Sardis that seemed to have the chief influence over the Kingdom of Lydia : Besides to add a greater freedom and confidence to the intended Treaty, the Ambassadours of Cyprus had permission according to their desires, to visit the Princess Cloria the Kings Daughter, as pretending they had Letters to deliver her from Narcissus Duke of Cyprus , whilst in the interim Commissioners were nominated presently to be sent to Euarchus . The Ambassadours upon their visit some dayes after, found Cloria in her own private lodgings where she was confined: She was clothed all in white after the manner of the vestal Virgins, not so much as one beautiful hair appearing, to adorn that handsomness that nature had bestowed upon her; as if she disdained any worldly ornaments, to become the sadness of her condition, in regard of her Fathers appearing captivity: however she wore upon her head a small Coronet of Gold, to shew she was not willing notwithstanding her many misfortunes, to wave those just titles that belonged to her birth and extraction: She had cast over her inward apparel, a long vail of black Cypress to the ground, which afforded a kinde of a melancholly prospect to her other garments, being a little opened before by her fair hand, the better to direct her steps towards the Ambassadour, whom she encountered by a few paces as they made their approaches; as it were to let them know, she was desirous to meet any intelligence from her dear Lord Narcissus , rather then resolved to keep state, whereby the entireness of her affection might not appear in a full prospect: Roxana her Governess carried up her train, as a slender mark onely of the remembrance of her own dignity. When the Ambassadours had made their full addresses, in some few complements, Cratus told her, that however they had brought no Letters to her Highness, from her gallant Brother Prince Arethusius , at the present remaining in the Island of Cyprus , grounded as he said upon some reasons of consequence, onely known to himself, yet he was to tender her a paper from their young Duke Narcissus , wherein was contained as he conceived as much affection and respect, as could possible come from any lover and servant, being at so great a distance, compelled thereunto, as he said by his unfortunate fates: The Princess received the welcome Letter, with a blushing countenance, participating alike both of joy and sorrow; at leastwise so exprest in her demeanour: She presently opening the paper, the in-side spoke a lovers language, as the out-side did this superscription.  Against the Gods determinations, it is not for mortals to contend, else it had not been in the worlds power, to have kept me from you so long a space: If I should make a particular relation of all my adventures since our last parting, I might rather trouble your patience in my Letter, then give you satisfaction in those things you most desire: onely let it suffice, these messengers are now come into Lydia , not onely to inform themselves concerning your concernments, but also to act other parts that may be most advantageable to your Fathers prosperity: If you blame my courage, in not being more violent in the prosecution, yet I must beseech you not to condemn my affection, before you throughly understand from the bearers the reasons of our designs. The easiest way of bringing things about, is rather to be chosen then violence and precipitation, since by the one we may more probably compass our desires, when as the other perchance will finde too much opposition at the best, and at the worst may thrust us upon unpossible consequences: I am loath to tell you how at the present, we are engaged in some hostility with many of our own Subjects, encouraged thereunto as it may be thought, by the like spirit, if not the same persons, that first gave contradiction to King Euarchus commands: In this War, I am resolved to overcome, whereby I may in some sort be thought worthy of Cloria's esteem, or else so to expire in the enterprize, as shall become the most humble servant of such a Princess. Narcissus.  As Cloria upon the reading of the Letter was sufficiently satisfied, with these temperate expressions of her dear lover, whose heart she knew was inwardly inflamed, with a most constant zeal to her particular; however at present necessarily incumbered, by the new oppositions of those people of Cyprus , that began also to envy his lustre and dignity, proceeding either from their own natures or designs, so on the other side, was she not without some apprehension, what might be the event of the Wars he had in hand, concerning both his person and honour; insomuch as she could not chuse but shed a few tears, before she entered into any more communication with the Ambassadours: but they quickly gave a stop to that sorrowful current, by assuring her, that as the War in all mens opinions, was not at all esteemed dangerous, so was it unpossible, but that the issue would be glorious and profitable, since it was onely one single Town, that seemed to resist, which once overcome, the rest of the Island, would continue more firm and constant in their obedience: After this they also let her know, that as they were imployed to perswade the Senate of Lydia , to a willing treaty and compliance with her Father King Euarchus , as most consonate to the rules of State, practised throughout all the Princes Courts of the lesser Asia , so had themselves already so far prevailed in their purposes, that Commissioners were appointed from the Senate, to wait upon the King to that effect; in whose company they also intended to make the same journey, whereby the better to compose those differences that should arise, occasioned by any accidental dispute: They added further, that the reasons why her Brother Prince Arethusius , and her servant Duke Narcissus , thought it more convenient at present, to use Perswasions rather then Threats, were, because not onely the Island of Cyprus , but the Kingdom of Syria , were both something engaged in civil broils: Wherefore by a little delay and appearing complyance, not onely those stirs would be pacified, but the Myssians in the interim might be dealt withal, about conditions necessary for the Kings establishment in his Throne, if the Treaty with the Senate should take no effect, which upon the matter they had already undertaken: besides they said, until there should be a general uniting together of other Princes in the design, by some convenient peace amongst themselves, which was now in agitation, it was something dangerous and hazzardable, to undertake either the conquest or reducement of Lydia to the Kings jurisdiction: Sweet Cloria was content to be satisfied with any probable reasons, that might give her hopes encouragement, since her former crosses and variety of discontents, had too much engrafted in her thoughts despairing fancies: So that after some time, she parted with the Ambassadours in a lovely smile, instead of other expressions; as if she did more depend upon their faithful industry, then in her own knowing judgement; however in her retiring, she cast back her looks upon her Governess Roxana , as it were also to demand her approbation, concerning her own carriage in that particular. It was not many dayes after this conference, before the Ambassadours, with the Senates Commissioners arrived at the place, where Euarchus kept rather the bounds of his own imprisonment, then any stately or Royal Court: For however the guards of Souldiers, were for the present removed from his person, yet being still kept within the circumference of the Island, it shewed, there was an intention to give that liberty a name of freedom onely, whereby his concessions might seem to the common view legal; for he had not any power at all, to winde himself out of his confinement, and as little to refuse the uttermost of what should be required from his prerogative: In this posture I say the Commissioners made their first addresses; within a while after they demanded, that as he was to take upon him the faults of all the blood, that had been spilt in the late wars of Lydia , so was he absolutely to quit the general protection of the Flamins , either in name or authority: Neither did they here rest, since they expected he should deliver up to the jurisdiction of the Senate, the chief mannagement of affairs in the Kingdom. The King at that time made them no other reply, but that he would take some short space of consideration, and then return them such an answer, as should best become the thoughts of a pious Prince, that more sought and desired the good of his people, then his own prosperity and Government. When they were parted from him, after some ceremonies used, he entred into communication with the Ambassadors of Cyprus , what might be the safest way, not to prejudice his own conscience, and yet give that satisfaction to the Senate which was required: To this with a grave countenance, and something a short pause, Zuphynon made unto him this Oration: Truly Sir, said he, as the Gods must be onely the Judges between your conscience, and inward thoughts, since opinions in matters of Religion, ought not to be perswaded by interest and worldly ends; so of the other side must I take liberty to say, that since the necessity of your condition, (which is not at present to be redeemed by the power and assistance of Forreign Princes, in regard of their own incumbered affairs) you ought to comply in all you can, with your prevailing Senate, hoping hereafter, that their own factions amongst themselves, (when they shall finde no resistance from your endeavours) may again in a short time, restore you to your Crown and Dignity: The contrary, as it would be a means the more to discover to their apprehensions, your own weakness, as your friends disabilities, so would it probably keep together those several interests, both in the Kingdom and Senate, (now in a manner encreasing to huge flames of discontent and confusion) that may be so united in the defence of the common cause, depending upon the general safety of their party, that all the Princes in Asia joyned together in after times, when they may be better provided, shall hardly remove either their resolutions or statious; besides your life may prove a sacrifice to their spleen and malice, if their suspicions be not qualified, by some seeming willing concessions on your part, to render them confident, you intend not any more to govern to their prejudice; since that is the entire period of their arms, whereby they may not onely secure the better, their own dangerous condition, but also enrich themselves and posterity to after ages in abundance. The King whilst Zutphynon was delivering thus much, cast down his eyes upon the ground; and with such a stedfast look, as if he onely sought consideration of the earth, since the Heavens had afforded him so little comfort: However when Zutphynon had made an end of his speech, he seemed to give him thanks, with a bend of his body; and presently taking Cratus the other Ambassadour by the hand, he retired with him into his Bed-chamber, where being alone without other company, after the King had demonstrated some passion in his heart, by a few Kingly tears, he used this discourse unto him. Cratus , said he, as I know I may presume absolutely upon your affection and fidelity, being sent out of the Island of Cyprus , from my Son Arethusius , and your own Duke Narcissus , whom I esteem in the same rank and quality, since his long pretentions to the love of my unfortunate Daughter Cloria , are testimonies sufficient, not onely of his noble nature, but of his constant disposition, whereby my confidence in his assistance, becomes ascertained: so of the other side, when I have delivered unto you my absolute consent, which I do at the present to those future Nuptials, to be solemnized as the Gods shall afford the conveniency, I must conjure you by all the former tyes of friendship, between me and the Family of your Duke, with as many more, as both Gods and Men can bestow upon mortality, not onely to give me your advice in these difficulties, wherein you finde me and my Kingdoms at the instant involved; but to lead me out without any flattery, from all those fond opinions, that may any way deceive my hopes, to my farther prejudice, left I be compelled at last to yield, to every thing dishonourable that will be demanded. Cratus with some little kinde of amazement, heard out the Kings desires to the last period, without any reply at all, untill at last, being invited to some answer by the importunity of his looks, he used this Language towards his satisfaction. Most certain it is, Sir, said he, that it is no easie matter for a person of what ability soever, to give counsel in the transactions of forreign Affairs, that concern not his own Nation; but much more difficult, to perswade without jealousie between a Prince and his people, already grown desperate in actions of contention, and accidents of War; however, rather then fail of that duty which belongs to your Majesties Commands, I am resolved, either to sacrifice my judgement or opinion, in performing what is desired, to the best advantage I am able towards your service. To this purpose, I conceive, in the first place you are to consider, your own now condition, and the little ability of other Princes to afford you assistance; for if I should esteem you at present, other then a prisoner to the Senate of Lydia , though still bearing the Name of a King; however that too more by sufferance then power, as I should scarce be thought worthy of my employment, as an Ambassadour; in that we are as well to look into the soul of things belonging to any Government, as onely to view the superficies of the Countrey and State, so might I betray your expectation: 'Tis true, there seems at present some desire of the people, to restore you again to your ancient dignity; but of the other side, the Senate are not onely Commanders of that prevailing Army, that hath so often beaten and subdued your Forces in every Province within your Dominions, but are really possessed of all the strong places of your Kingdom, that probably should give your party, either reception or countenance; which consequently denies you both Arms and Ammunition, to defend your self, or offend others; so that of necessity you will be left to their mercy. In the next place, your Majesty must reflect upon the incumbrances of your neighbours, that absolutely at present takes from your hopes, all expectation of succours and assistance from forreign Princes. The King of Syria you see, is so violently engaged in a lasting war with the Egyptian Empire; besides his late combustions at home amongst his own people, that if he would, he cannot so much as attempt the redeeming of your losses, for fear of giving too great a colour for Lydia , to joyn with Sorastros his mortal enemy, upon which interest as you very well know, all the rest of the Princes of the inferior rank seem to depend. And lastly we may be certainly assured, that the people of the Island of Cyprus , begins to envy the authority of Narcissus their young Duke; insomuch, as if he should but move a stone, towards the entring into a new war, although grounded upon never so great justice and right in your behalf, it were enough to occasion the Rebellion of the whole Countrey. These things being considered, with many others that might be mentioned to the same purpose, undoubtedly the safest way you can take, is at the present to comply in a manner entirely with your Senate, until the Gods shall better enable you to regain, what you have already lost of those dues that belong to your Royal Crown and Dignity; and bravely or piously in the interim, content your thoughts, not onely with the justness of your cause, but with the hopes of those continual factions, that will daily arise in the Kingdom of Lydia for your advantage; the rather, for that if Hercrombrotus should again return to the City of Sardis , with his triumphant Army, before the finishing of the Treaty between you and these Commissioners, (which the Senate hath sent to that effect) he might easily give Laws to both your endeavours; and not onely chuse whether you should be King or no, but whether the Senators themselves should sit in their places: Besides I must tell you, I cannot perfectly trust my own Companion Zutphyton in your behalf, since by many discourses I finde him inclinable, to settle a Trade between these people of Lydia , and our own Countrey-men, notwithstnnding any contention of you and your Subjects; which would in after times, much obstruct all proceedings intended for your particular concernment: since States for the most part, look more after the commodity they may obtain, then into the right of the cause they dispute. The King when the Ambassador had made an end of speaking, told him with his eyes lifted up to heaven, that as he hoped the Gods would protect his innocent posterity, in their just rights after his death, so must he have a care of his own conscience, whereby not any further to exasperate the Heavens indignation against his person; with these words, he went out with Cratus into the other room, where he had left the rest of the company, left too much suspicion might be gathered from their communication. As some time was spent in ordinary discourses, before the Ambassadours took their leaves of the King, so when they were departed, he retired again into his private Cabinet, where after a few tears dropping down from his eyes, as the greater testimonies of his sad and afflicted heart, he disputed these considerations within his own bosome. Why should my unkinde Subjects, thought he, put me upon these straights, that either I must confess my self guilty of those crimes I never intended to commit, or quit my interest to those Crowns, that have for so many lasting ages, been worn by by my predecessors? who perhaps were far more rigorous in their actions then my self. O you Gods, said he, where are those faults for which I am so deeply punished by your indignation, as well as my peoples disobediences? If they be visible to be known to the world, why are they not in some measure made apparant to my understanding, that either knowingly I might suffer, or Asia be satisfied in my obstinacy? since the contrary doth but dishonour other Princes, without affording me the comfort to ask Pardon, in that I know not who or wherein I have offended: If I follow not the tract of my Ancestors, conserving those priviledges belonging to my Crowns, without demanding more of my Subjects, or that I intended not to rule according to those principles, I confess they might have cause to quarrel with my proceedings; but when my Reign hath been gentler then former Kings and Princes of the same line, that could challenge by right no greater prerogative then my self, why should they continue so cruel to my purposes? Is it not sufficient for the quieting of the hearts of my people, that I willingly transfer part of my power to the Senate, whereby they may be able to make what Laws they please, both against them and me; but I must also accuse my own innocency, to give both honour and belief to their actions, whereby posterity might curse my very name and being to all eternity? When the King in this manner, had spent all the store of his inward passions, he went into the Garden to take his ordinary recreations, and after that to supper, where he used without any seeming trouble of minde, those common discourses amongst his followers, which education and custom had enured both his nature and conversation unto, until the time of the night invited him to some necessary rest against the next mornings dispute, which he supposed he was to have with those Commissioners, the Senate had sent for his final answer to their demands. The next day according to expectation, the Commissioners appeared before Euarchus , unto whom he made this short Speech: My Lords and Gentlemen, said he, if I should again redouble my many protestations, concerning my pure and unfeigned intentions, perhaps that preposterous violence, would create in your apprehensions, rather suspicion then belief of my future intentions; wherefore I shall onely leave the Gods to be searchers of my breast, as the perswaders of your opinions; and however I have been heretofore most unfortunate in that particular, (since so much innocent blood hath been spilt, for want of sufficient credulity) I am resoved now by other means, if it be possible, to satisfie the Senate, whereby unhappy Lydia may once more be settled in a quiet posture, for the good and prosperity of my people: With these words he let fall a few majestick tears, as the strongest proof either of his integrity or sorrow: when he had paused for some pretty space, in a certain kinde of seeming extasie, he continued his discourse after this manner. The propositions, said he, sent me by your powerful and prevailing Senate, if I be not deceived, consist of two natures: the one in a perfect resignation of all my legal jurisdiction, into their hands, for that it is pretended they both can and will govern better then my self: The other seems to challenge a greater prerogative over me, then I have any way power to bestow upon them, since they would have me confess a guilt in those crimes, my inward thoughts never as yet gave consent unto, which puts me upon these difficulties, that either I must hypocritically accuse my own innocency, to the outward face of the world, or be absolutely deprived of that happiness, we all hope for and expect by this Treaty; nevertheless to let both Gods and men see, how willing I am to any compliance, that may again restore peace and tranquility to this unhappy Nation; in the first place (for else as it should seem the Senate cannot be satisfied) I am content to admit, I was in the beginning, the chief occasion of the late Wars: In the next place, for a farther confirmation of that satisfaction, (the chief thing desired) I will lay down my own Kingly Authority, for so long a season as the Senate shall think convenient, towards the absolute settling of private and publick differences of the Kingdom; provided no act of mine may any way hereafter, do prejudice either to my Sons right, or exclude the Flamins from those essential dues, that appertain to the real worship of the Gods; which being said, he sate down in his chair, with two or three melancholly sighs, as if he were constrained like a sad Pelican , in a wilderness of discontents, to sacrifice the very life of all his happinesse, for his Subjects future prosperity. The Commissioners of the Senate, after the King had made an end of speaking, drew together in a little nook of the room; there as it should seem the better to consult among themselves, what answer was fittest to be returned, whilst in the interim Euarchus held a private conference with Cratus in another part of the Chamber. The people that were about the Kings person, might note in his countenance, many several changes as he discoursed with the Ambassadour: sometimes he would cast down his eyes upon the ground, as if he coveted a grave for an everlasting resting place, rather then to be thus incumbred with cares, and continual vexations, proceeding onely from the envious suspicion of his own people, without any known cause, either from his actions or intentions: Then of a sudden he would behold the Ambassadour full in the face, intimating the desire of some instructions from his very looks, what were best to be done for his own honour, according to the rules and opinions of other Princes, of the same extraction and dignity as himself: Last of all, he began a most earnest expostulation with the Ambassadour; as it was supposed by those that were present, concerning some particulars of his own speech, and the Senates demands: These several postures entertained the time, until one of the Commissioners of the Senate, after consulting with his fellows, desired a new audience of the King. As we cannot Sir, said he, but congratulate this happy occasion, that hath administred sufficient means, towards the settlement of the troubled affairs of this ancient and sometime flourishing Kingdom of Lydia , of late disturbed by the differences between you, and your faithful people; so must I again more then lament, to finde still in your Majesty, no small averseness from the Senates good purposes; since the most materiall point of difference, from whence this bloody war hath proceeded, rests as yet in your breast, not at all removed by any seeming resolution: 'Tis true, I shall not need much more to insist upon perswasions, when as besides those multitudes of reasons, that have been so often offered to your consideration, we have sufficient power by the Gods assistance, rather to compel then desire any thing, that may either secure our selves, or good the people; since the victorious Souldiers have not yet quitted their Arms or their Triumphs: And so consequently will both defend and prosecute their and our designs, against any that shall oppose or question such actions; either in the present or the future: Wherefore give me leave without insolency to tell you, that as that blood that hath been already shed, in this unfortunate war of Lydia , must be required from those that are judged guilty of the crime, so cannot our judicious Senate rest satisfied in their inward thoughts, concerning the discharge of their own duties to the people, unless the Flamins are absolutely out of the Temples, as well in name as in jurisdiction: Upon this Commission onely we have power to treat, and that not being speedily effected, as the Army under the command of Farezius the General, may quickly, if not violently send a threatning prohibition to all we have done; since this meeting is appointed as we all know, absolutely without the Souldiers directions or allowance, so of the other side, must we take our leaves of your Majesty. The King after he had heard out this Oration, he cast his eyes again upon the Ambassadours of Cyprus , (though with something a smiling countenance) as it were by his very looks reproving, not onely the unreasonableness of the demands, but the insolency of those demanding; who went about more to compel his conscience, then to perswade his reason by the discourse, when he had continued in this posture for some short time, without speaking one word to any, (whilst in the interim the other Commissioners of the Senate, came also to the communication) the King at last in a kinde of a passionate haste, mixed notwithstanding with some few expressions of seeming friendship, told the Assembly, that both the nature and the manner of their desires (if not rather compulsions, according to their own words) required a little consideration in the reply, and therefore wisht them the next day to attend his pleasure in the same place. The night after this discourse, the King employed himself instead of any sleep, in many troublesome considerations; sometimes he would expostulate his sufferings with the Gods in this manner. O you immortal powers, said he, why have you created man; or rather Princes themselves to be the subjects of all misery and misfortune? In not onely exposing their persons to derision and contempt, but in possessing others with opinions, that both their thoughts and actions are masked, with nought but fraud and impiety; or rather more justly may I say, why do you suffer such hypocrisie amongst men unpunished, who onely put on countenances of Religion and Justice, when their intentions aim at nothing but cruelty and injustice? Is it possible that those fair propositions I have made, whereby to shew clemency, or perswade belief, can be so much mistaken in the worlds apprehensions, as not to be well taken or rightly understood? No, no, 'tis private ends and violent ambition, that onely hinders my good and the Gods service; which I know the Heavens must punish though I perish; otherwhiles he more particularly reflects upon his inward thoughts and outward actions, to see if he could yet finde any cause for the Senates cruelty or suspition: After he had thus expostulated with himself, he would rest some time in a deep and melancholly contemplation, and then break out again into these passionate expressions. O Euarchus, Euarchus , where is now all thy power and jurisdiction? whereby of old thou didst not onely govern thy own Subjects without contradiction, but in a manner give Laws to other Princes both by Sea and Land, since at present thou hast not authority sufficient left thee, to make thy own people yield to what is not onely just, but most convenient for their own safeties. O you Gods, said he, what impieties now have influence over this inferior world, when as men go about to usurp your authority, and by a certain hidden pride and cruelty, tyrannize over the very consciences, as well as the actions of Princes? If not, how is it possible, but that the Senate should be contented, (if not to suffer the Flamins to remain still in the Temples) at leastwise to let those that would, make use of their function in private for their own satisfaction, to enjoy the priviledge? I desire to maintain no other jurisdiction, then what my happy and noble Ancestors, have practised for many lasting Generations; wherefore tax not my ambition, in imposing Laws upon the consciences of my Subjects, contrary to right and reason: But you, O Senate of Lydia , that attempt these innovations, either out of fantastical pride, or for some other covetous ends, give me leave, not onely to complain of your proceedings, but in what I can to contradict your impieties. When he had in this manner sufficiently wearied himself with these thoughtful expostulations, and had also walked many turns about his Chamber, onely by the light of a dim Lamp, that hung in the middle of the room; in the interim, sometimes beating his breast with an extraordinary violence, otherwhiles crossing his arms, as if in that sorrowful posture, he desired some information again from his inward thoughts, what resolutions were best to be taken for the next dayes encounter, since he conceived it to be the uttermost period, of what fate he was to expect in Lydia , by the sufferance of his enemies, he went to the bed-side of one of his servants, that lay in a lobby not far from his own Chamber; where having first wakened him by many calls, (who belike was not possest with so many cares as the King, to trouble his rest) commanded him instantly to go for Cratus , one of the Ambassadours of Cyprus , whilst himself, as he said, would expect him in the Ante-Chamber, belonging to his own privy Lodgings. No sooner was Cratus arrived according to the Kings desires, but with a great deal of passion (after he had embraced him) told him, that as he had most confidence in his integrity, being sent from his dear friend and Son-in-law Narcissus ; so was it now full time, to make use both of his wisdom and kindness, since the Senate of Lydia not onely violently prest him to the resignation of all his honour and authority, but challenged a new prerogative over his inward conscience, which was not in his power, as he said, to deliver up into their possession, without the consent and approbation of the immortal Gods: wherefore as it was not within the compass of any jurisdiction, to dispose of sacred things otherwise, then by heavenly Laws and Ordinances, so would he be content, for the pretended satisfaction of his people, to suspend that point of difference, concerning the taking away, both the authority and the names of the Flamins out of the Temples; however no longer then until by a farther disputation, either himself or the Senate, might rest satisfied concerning the truth, and the legality of their function. O Cratus , said the King, thus have I presumed upon your trouble, at this unseasonable time of the night, in regard that to morrow being the last day of our meeting, you might employ your best industry with the Commissioners to joyn in such a compliance, as might prevent all sudden accidents, that might occasion either the breach or disturbance of this intended Treaty, either by the Army, or others of a contrary Faction. This being said, the King again taking the Ambassadour by the hand, with tears in his eyes, assured him all his desires were, more to do good to his people then to satisfie his own passions; wherefore wisht him forthwith to repair to the Senates Commissioners, and try what effects his perswasions could work upon their natures to that purpose. As Cratus could not but admire the Kings goodness, as well as pitty his condition, so did he promise to employ the utmost of his endeavours, to bring about the rigid Commissioners, to comply in this reasonable request with his desires; to which effect he presently took his leave, as conceiving it a kinde of a respectful charity, not any longer to keep the King from his bed, since he found his distracted and tormenting thoughts, had too much trespassed already, upon his rest and quiet all the former part of the night. In the morning very early, Cratus visited the Commissioners, with a passion that merited such an employment, as from such a person. Gentlemen, said he, have you lost your wits as well as your seeming goodness? Have you got so much already from your King, that you go about now to lose that, and all you have in being over covetous? Is it not sufficient that you obtain without any labour, the very essential and real points of your demands, but that you must now seek to play wantonly with his misfortunes? As it were destroying both your own and the peoples liberties, by suffering the Souldiers to come between you and those happinesses, which you expect from this Treaty and Concessions: Can you be so blinded in your opinions, as to think all the other Princes of Asia will suffer you thus to deprive Euarchus of his Crown, without calling your actions to an account? Especially finding you so unreasonable in your proceedings, that no grants or offers from your King, will satisfie either your covetousness or ambition. Truly, although you could be possessed with such hopes, by reason of the backwardness of other States, to interest themselves in the affairs of your Kingdom, being as you believe involved into too many troubles of their own; yet certainly according to my opinion, the Gods will scarce suffer you to intrench overmuch upon their proper priviledges, since Euarchus desires but onely the suspension of that, which belongs to the Jurisdiction of the Flamins , until by further dispute his conscience may be better satisfied, touching the right and legality of their names and function within his Dominion: Last of all, give me leave to tell you, that although our Countrey, the Island of Cyprus , have ever entertained in their bosoms, extraordinary and most affectionate desires, to conserve an intire friendship and commerce with your Kingdom of Lydia , yet when they shall finde your natures so much changed from your ancient principles, as neither to entertain wisdom in your Councels, nor justice in your actions, whilst you thus refuse your Kings love and goodness, they may at last turn the points of their weapons, both at Sea and Land, (which for this many years they have employed with so prosperous success against the great Monarch of Egypt ) to pluck down that prosperity you now enjoy by your fortunate Victories. Although this language may seem a little too peremptory, onely from an Ambassadour of Cyprus , yet 'tis that affection that we desire to continue with your people, that makes me both bold and confident, to tell you what I ought, as well as to perswade you as I can, rather by truth and reason, then with flattery and complaints. Although the Senates Commissioners appeared, not onely something surprized, but much more disturbed, in regard they esteemed it rather a bold reproof, then an ordinary admonition of Cratus , yet considering his reasons of consequence, as well as being unwilling to have any difference with the Island of Cyprus , that had been for so many years esteemed a constant friend to the Kingdom of Lydia ; they held it at leastwise a better piece of policy, either to convert his judgement, or to comply with his desires, rather then abruptly to appear inclinable, to break violently or passionately with that ancient amity; wherefore one of them, dressing his countenance in a certain kinde of dissembling smile, as if the whole Company had cause enough to be angry with his discourse, if not with his passion, told him, that however they were not accustomed, to hear such language, from any other neighbouring Countrey; yet in regard they believed his words, proceeded from an inward and hearty affection, towards a well settled peace between Euarchus and his people, without any other design or disaffection to this Nation or Senate, they were resolved once more to consult among themselves, how he might be fullier satisfied concerning their intentions: To which purpose they wisht him to have some competent patience, whilst they retired for an hour or thereabouts amongst themselves, after which they promised him to return, with an ample resolution to his demands, either by arguments or consent, that could not any way be contradicted without precipitation or obstinacy: scarce was the time of an hour expired, but the Commissioners of the Senate returned to Cratus , who would not stir from the place without their full determinations; considering the deep engagement he had undertaken to the King, which was to try the uttermost of his power, whereby to bring the Treaty to a good and speedy issue; the rather for that according to many rumours spread amongst the people, the Army that was under Farezius's command, intended to interrupt the conclusion of the peace, at leastwise the effect of any agreement; since it was wholly designed without the Souldiers consents; and as 'twas pretended, to destroy all military interest within the Kingdom of Lydia , whereby to cast the whole Government of the Nation, meerly upon the Senates authority: When the Commissioners were seated in their places, the chief, of them used this language. My Lord Ambassadour of Cyprus , said he; as we shall never be willing to remember any unkindness offered us by the people of your Countrey, and as little those passionate words that proceeded from your self but even now, so are we at present ready to let you know the reasons, why we appear so rigorous (according to your apprehension) in our transactions with Euarchus the King. In the first place therefore I must tell you, that we have no larger a Commission from the Senate to treat; much less to conclude, but what we have signified in our discourse and propositions, neither concerning the Flamins , nor in any other particulars: In the next place it is as certain, and we believe sufficiently known to all the world, that the Senate of Lydia have bound themselves by an oath, (solemnly taken before the Deputies of the Myssian Nation) never to allow of the Flamins in our Temples, nor any other customs belonging to the Worship of the Gods, but what they use aud practice in their own Countrey; so that without their approbation, our Governours cannot dispence with that Article; however to let you see, how willing we are to comply both with your desires, and the Kings gentleness, we will for the present suspend, so far with the rigour of our Commission, occasioned partly by the rigid severity of the Myssian people, that that particular onely of the Lydian Flamins , shall be referred to the Senate sitting at Sardis , and in the interim both the King and our selves, if he please, will equally subscribe the rest of the concluded agreement. To be short, Cratus was not much displeased at this resolution, and went presently with the Commissioners into the Kings chamber, where Euarchus had attended with much impatiency, what hopes his endeavours would produce, towards the settlement of the distracted affairs of Lydia , according to his wishes and desire; when they first entered the room, the King beheld them with such a look, as if he had expected either life or death from their determinations, concerning the controversie now in question. As it was not long before Cratus acquainted him with their proceedings, (which he entertained with joy enough) so the next day, they all took their journey towards the great City of Sardis , whereby either to receive a confirmation, or a condemnation of their endeavours. Upon their arrival at Sardis , the Deputies of Myssia were presently sent for to the Senate, to be made privy to all those transactions, that had passed between the King and the Commissioners, in the Island, where he remained confined: The chief debate in the Councel was, whether Euarchus had given sufficient satisfaction to the people of Lydia or no, concerning the Flamins , and their jurisdiction in the Temples: After a long disputation and much contradiction, it was put to the question, how far the Kings concession should be allowed: The Deputies of the Myssian Nation were demanded, either to give their consents, or deliver their opinions: Those persons belike fearing, that if they should seem at the present over rigid in that particular, the agreement with Euarchus would be indangered or protracted to their disadvantage, since onely by a settlement of affairs between the King and the Senate, they might hope for a new interest in the Kingdom of Lydia , wherefore speedily gave their consents, with the rest of their faction; however to the discontent of the other Senators, though fewer in number of the contrary opinion: Neither did Farezius himself, at that time, seem to discent from the agreement and resolution, being General of the Army and protector of the Souldiers; insomuch as presently with some acclamations of joy, they published through all the principal streets of Sardis , a demonstration of their happiness by this accord, ready to be made as 'twas pretended with their King. However a seeming peace, appeared already to be spread throughout all the Territories of the Lydian Monarchy, yet two Senators named Gyges and Scinon , that had received as they thought affronts, in those disputations and decrees that had passed, went instantly to one Iris a chief Commander in the Senates Army: and after they hade made this Officer, particularly acquainted with the causes of their complaints, pretending the Myssian Deputies absolutely governed all the Councels and resolutions of the Senate, by which means that Nation intended to become new rulers in the Kingdom of Lydia , to the enriching of themselves and enslaving of the people; intimating what loss and prejudice the Souldiers would receive by this agreement, when as already it was propounded to have many of their Troops disbanded, without rewards or satisfaction, desired him, he would endeavour some obstruction with Farezius and the Army in this particular, or else they feared as they said, the Gods would send down plagues from the Heavens, to punish the injustice that was offered to the people and Nation. Although Iris at the first, was something amazed at this seeming fury and distraction, yet knowing many of the Souldiers and common people to be of the same faction and interest, he went the next morning to Farezius the General accompanied by many Officers of the Army, to whom he used these words: My Lord, said he, I begin now to perceive, that not onely the power and interest of the Souldiers, are fallen in the opinion of the world, when the Senate dares again boldly act without our authority, but also may as it is to be supposed within a short time, instead of being rewarded for those gallant services we have performed, in the redemption of the Kingdom of Lydia , from her present and future miseries, be entirely disbanded into the world, without pay or other recompence; onely to converse with scorn and contempt, among the common people, who perhaps neither love our persons, or will alwayes relieve our wants, if we should be in this manner necessited to rely wholly upon their charity: shall it be thought, that when we expect to enjoy the fruits of our labours, after our so many scars and wounds, we should be frustrated of those conscionable dues belonging to our deserts, for no other reason, but that the Myssian Deputies would enrich themselves, with the Trophies and spoils of our Nation? who knows not that Euarchus is yet more inclinable to their satisfaction, then to his Kingdoms good, since all our endeavours to win his affection, both by his releasement from prison, when he was absolutely under the Senates jurisdiction, and his civil usage from time to time by the whole Army, have not been sufficient motives as we see, either to perswade his belief towards our particular, or so much as to procure any manner of approbation, much less confidence in the Souldiers behalf, from his ungrateful Queen: No, no General, said he, it is unpossible to withdraw the Syrian Nation from the unworthy Myssians , since as that State conceives to have a particular predomination over those people, so must we never expect to come in competition with their interest, by what good office soever we shall either offer or do for Euarchus ; and so consequently he nor none of his family, can be won to us or our posterity, having so great and large an interest in the Syrian blood and name: wherefore I say, if we suffer this treaty to go on, between the King, Senate, and Myssians , let the Army presently lay down their weapons, as a wished sacrifice to this intended conjunction; since never more will there be need of our assistance: After which the Senate may govern, the Myssians triumph; notwithstanding Euarchus may still be kept a greater prisoner to both their ends and purposes, then now he undergoes under our Forces and Authority: So that let us either make him ours, as best deserving his trust and affection, or absolutely sever that interest and power, that resolves not so much to help him, as to destroy us. In short it may be considered, that whilst the Souldiers keep together in one entire affection, they will appear to all Lydia , to have such a strong and powerful body; as must not onely terrifie our enemies, but procure us recompence, resembling so many small wands bound up together in one bundle, which in the whole make up a force of some consideration, whereas one by one, or distracted in our resolutions, we shall easily be broken in pieces, by every popular or violent storm of spight and disaffection: The rather may I urge this wise and necessary conjunction, there being no face of power for the present, that dares contend, either with our valour or fortune; which I must tell you, we cannot long promise to our hopes, if we go not about to prevent future mischiefs, whilst the Gods have bestowed upon us both the means and the opportunity; for that we have not onely overcome the King, but threatned the Senate, who certainly will remember those conceived affronts, when they shall be rendred any way capable, either to restrain our power, or divest us of that authority, which they suppose we now enjoy contrary to their wills and intentions, nor may we hope to obtain the like opportunity again, by any industry we can use, since we have not onely lost much of the affections of the people, in having quartered freely upon their Estates without interruption, but have also distasted the rich City of Sardis , in a most high measure by our attempts, in having so lately outed them of many of their priviledges: so that it will be unpossible again, to form a new Army, this being once broken, since from the multitude must come the supplies, as from the Town must issue the money, to make good such an assembly. This being considered in every particular, give me leave to conjure you, by those burning flames yet remaining I hope in your heroical bosom, that deservedly once made you the just owner of so many noble and gallant victories, by which the people of Lydia , had almost purchased to themselves and posterity a new liberty, rather to tear up the root of those ancient Laws, that hath for so may ages detained the poor Subjects in a continued captivity, then suffer such deceits again to prosper, under the name of a well settled Monarchy, which in effect threatens nothing else but tyranny and oppressions to all sorts of conditions: whilst we suffer what hath been formerly gained by the Sword, with the dear expence of so much precious blood, to be lost from our possession, by the onely practice of a few ignorant, though crafty Councels, made up in haste, between fear and desperation? must our gallant Army become humble suitors to the Myssian Deputies, after all their unexampled services, to be still continued in those offices, that made both them and the Senate what they are? shall we with our Petitions in our hands be seen, daily to attend the proud Citizens of Sardis , for nothing but to be paid our just dues, when as we fought chiefly to maintain them in a luxurious prosperity, which renders them now rich and respected before other people? what may our yet remaining party in the Senate think of our courages, or the Gods judge of our consciences, when as we shall suffer the one to be lost, as the other to be contemned, by those that appear to hate the first, and despise the latter, seeking no other thing but to couzen us out of our rights and priviledges, whereby themselves onely under the borrowed name of a King, would usurp dominion and jurisdiction over the estates and persons of the deceived and afflicted Subjects? No no, my Lord General, said he, let us whilst we may, prevent these threatning mischiefs, lest when we would, we want the capacity to do it, and then as our own people would perpetually curse us for the omission, so all the world besides might very well deride us, for having neither hearts nor brains, to contend against so contemptible and weak a power, that never as yet fought for their own interest, however by craft and subtilty they have had the fortune to destroy ours. To effect what we should wish, certainly there is no other way, but violently to break and destroy this treaty, whereupon depends either our good or evil; which being put in execution, we may seize the Kings person into the Souldiers possession, and by that means make him entirely what we desire, as I said before, or render his condition nothing, that he may not become instrumental to our mortal enemies. Farezius , although he seemed very attentive to the discourse, that was delivered by Iris , yet by the distractedness of his countenance, it was easily to be perceived, that his resolution in matters of councel and difficulty, did not at all answer to his natural courage in the field, wherein he appeared for the most part daring, above the common sort of those of his own profession, which made him for something a long space continue silent: Nevertheless, at last finding the other Officers of the Army, expected to know both his pleasure and opinion, he desired in words further to be advertized, not onely what, but how their designs might be put in execution, with the best advantage both for the Kingdoms good and the Souldiers security. Gyges one of the discontented Senators, taking his words for an absolute consent in his resolutions, told him instantly, though in a brief manner, that as there could be no safety to their party, but by prosecuting the dictates of Iris to the uttermost of their power, so would it be no difficult matter at all, under his present power and authority, with some chosen Troops of Souldiers, to seize upon those Members of the Senate, that had already consented to an agreement with the King, contrary to former decrees and orders; and then immediately to quarter those Companies, with the addition of some others of the same trust, in the rich City of Sardis , whereby the better to keep the Citizens in obedience, whilst with more conveniency they might remove Euarchus to some other station or confinement, to be disposed of as they should think fit hereafter. Farezius , however he gave them authority to use his name in the service, yet he appeared not at that time, to be over well satisfied with their determination, as conceiving belike the work they went about, might prove of a very dangerous consequence to the present affairs, and future quiet of the Kingdom of Lydia: Nevertheless I say, finding the Officers of the Army, with those discontented Senators violent in their desires, he joyned in his absolute consent, notwithstanding his present retirement, with some melancholly in his countenance. Farezius within two or three dayes space, began to be more strongly confirmed in his resolutions, and to that purpose, with choice bands of Souldiers, he commanded Iris to beset the Senate-House, whereby to seize upon such persons, as he should finde any way refractory to the Armies interest: After which he gave him Commission with other Companies to march into the City, and take possession of such fortified places, as might either secure their own proceedings, or give any conveniency of resistance to their supposed enemies, to withstand their decrees and jurisdiction: When those Senators were thus imprisoned, that seemed to be of the contrary faction, whilst many Troops in the interim, were lodged in the chief Temples of the Town, Farezius gave also order to have Euarchus sent to another Fort in the Island. The Castle designed for the Kings new imprisonment, was seated upon a Rocky Isthmus, that afforded it almost no more ground, then was necessary for the building thereof; so that the continual beating of the waves of the Sea, upon the ragged sides of the Cliffs in the night season, gave a most melancholly horrour to the thoughts and apprehension of people, which allowed the King scarce any other recreation, then what proceeded from the daily exercise of his own pen, that in a manner he imployed continually, in setting down all the unfortunate passages of his life; though sometimes he mixed his studies, with divers contemplations of the uncertainty of worldly affairs. Thus I may say for the most part, he spent the tedious hours of his imprisonment for some weeks, until the Governour as it should seem, being of something a noble nature; and so consequently pittying his captivity, not onely afforded him oftentimes the conveniency of his own conversation, but would now and then suffer him to walk in a small Alley belonging to the Castle, bounded onely by the Walls of the one side, as by the Sea of the other; which notwithstanding, gave a more then ordinary delight to his senses, in that it not onely allowed him the liberty of stirring in the fresh aire, a benefit that nature and custom had enured him unto from his infancy; but also laid open to his view, the large and delighful prospect of the main Ocean, as well as otherwhiles, brought to his sight and consideration, many brave Ships coming and going out of the neighbouring Haven. This courtesie of the Captain, in time so wrought upon the Kings disposition, that he began to be something confident of his affection, and that confidence made him one day as they were sitting together (which the King would needs have) demand the cause of the suddain alteration of his imprisonment? as also what the Souldiers meant further to do with his person as he believed? the Governour whose name was Creon , returned him this answer; or rather I may call it a discourse for the length of it. Truly Sir, said he, as I profess before the immortal Gods, I was not any way privy, much less consenting to your new restraint, since my intentions are more to thrive by a settled unity, according to the ancient and known Laws of the Kingdom of Lydia , then to fish in troubled waters, whereby to become rich from other mens labours, in nothing but tumults and disorders; so must your Majesty give me leave to tell you, without any manner of flattery, that the fears and jealousies the Souldiers have, to be outwitted by the Myssians Deputies, and by that consequence to be deprived of all their jurisdiction and present command, which they conceive they have dearly bought, with the much expence of their blood, is the greatest occasion of your ill usage at this time; so until they can be assured of the total suppression of that faction, that aims at an accord with your self, onely thereby to govern the more absolutely, I do not see how probably you can expect a releasement from your continued miseries: and the rather, for that they finde the State and Kingdom of Syria , is no way possible to be wrought, either to forsake the Myssian interest, or to put any confidence in the Armies proceedings, concerning their own or your particular; which at last of necessity would render the Souldiers power and authority as they believe, little or nothing at all in Lydia ; since a rigid Government will be established, more by laws and decrees of the Senate, then by the actions and imployments of the Sword, wherein the Army will have the least interest; and the Commanders not having gained sufficiently according to their expectation, they are resolved to hazzard all, rather then to have a peace to be established without their absolute satisfaction, answerable to their first intentions and desires; so that they are determined to keep you still in prison, whereby to prevent you from joyning in any legal right or execution, with those people and faction, that would suppress them, when they have but made use of you hitherunto for their own advantages; and by that means still keep themselves in the height of ambition and imployment. To the other part of your question, what might be the farther intention of the Souldiers concerning your particular person? as I cannot but hope well of their meaning, since it is not to be expected, that they have the least determination to offer force, where they may probably hope to perswade; so of the other side, I am of opinion, that they put on countenances of some terrour and cruelty, whereby the better to bring you about to their purposes, and by consequence, would work the Syrian (and namely your own Queen Hyacinthia ) not onely to an absolute complyance, with the Actions and authority of the Souldiers of the Army, but also to take from the Myssians all hopes of governing, or remaining in Lydia to their prejudice, since they know those people to be proud, covetous, and crafty in extremity; and therefore are resolved no further to trust their dissimulation, then may from time to time stand with their own security, in regard in the reign of your Father (as they say) the whole Kingdom was sufficiently troubled with their insolency; which is as much as I can say upon this subject: So that I shall leave the rest to your further consideration. The King some time after this discourse, according to the liberty the Captain had given him, to walk upon that part of the Rock without the Castle wall, a Sentinel being onely to attend him at something a far distance, one day above others, he might see a little Bark that hovered a long space upon the Sea, about the bottom of the clifts below him, where standing still to view the often turnings of the Boat, of a suddain before he was well aware, he might perceive a Ship-boy (as he conceived) to draw a little Bowe he held in his hand, and not long after a small Arrow made of a natural Cane, fell almost at his feet, which presently taking it up, he found fastned to the head thereof, a paper rowled up together in the manner of a Letter, whose superscription was intirely directed unto himself: The words being, to Euarchus the great (though most unfortunate) King of Myssia , as well as Lydia: as he could not be but something amazed, at this seeming strange and unexpected adventure, so of the other side, the writing quickly brought again to his consideration, his present condition with his many misfortunes; and this caused him with some few deep sighs, to open the paper, wherein he quickly found in fair characters this matter contained.  Being informed by certain spies, we have ever kept about the Island, since your new imprisonment, that you were accustomed, to walk often upon the Rock, without the Castle Wall, we thought it our duties by this stratagem, to design some intelligence, that might bring you both comfort and relief: wherefore be pleased to know, that as the great Kingdom of Syria , with the rich Island of Cyprus , besides many other powerful Princes, are resolved to stand to our assistance, for your establishment again in your Royal Throne and Dignity; so if you can put any confidence, in this small Bark now remaining upon the water for your transportation, the people being habited like those of Cyprus , shall be ready when you appoint, to furnish you with materials for your escape; and deliver you upon the Tarras, one end of a little cord, that may with a great deal of ease, help you to descend to the foot of the Rock: In the interim, make no accord at all with the Souldiers without our privity, since a gallant Army is now raising in Myssia , for your advantage: You shall finde also here inclosed, a leaden Pen, whereby in another piece of paper you may fully signifie your minde. Your most dutiful Subjects, the faithful Deputies of Myssia .  Although this adventure, appeared little else then a meer plot, to discover or try farther the Kings inclination, towards the Myssians his natural Countreymen, yet at the present he was so much transported with a joyful hope, concerning the success of this enterprize towards his advantage, that he perswaded himself, in complying with the occasion, without other considerations, he should not onely win Myssia , but please Syria ; insomuch, as instantly making use of the leaden pen, which was inclosed in the letter, he writ an answer to the paper after this manner.  I take this advertisement rather sent from the Gods, then any way rest doubtful of the Myssians intentions; wherefore as I am resolved, no way to make any agreement with the Souldiers, without the consent of the Court of Syria , so am I resolved to morrow about the same hour, to repair again to these walks, at what time, if the preparations you shall make may be convenient any way to answer my expectation, as I shall esteem my self happy in my own liberty; so may you be ever confident of my affection: unto which I willingly subscribe my name. Euarchus.  The King when he had writ thus much, he stept to the border of the Rock, and cast down the paper into the Boat; after which he presently retired into his own Lodgings, with a sufficient contentment as it might be imagined, both in his heart and countenance, though he was far from discovering his thoughts, either to the Captain of the Castle, or any of his attendants; nevertheless to colour the better his intended design, all the afternoon he imployed his time, in the conversation of the common Souldiers, performing such pastimes and exercises in their companies, as most suited with their natures and breeding, however done onely on purpose, the better to disguise his intentions from their suspicions. Thus, I say, did good Euarchus please onely his fancy, with the hopes of those assurances, that were either feigned of themselves, or doubtful in the execution; since to this day it rests most uncertain, whether the King were more unfortunate by his fates, or betrayed in his Councels; notwithstanding these thoughts kept him imployed all the former part of the night, for that the Idea's of a new prosperity, seemed to entertain his minde, though they destroyed his rest: but about the hour of one in the morning, when his senses necessarily were entered into their own quiet, by reason of his long watching (or rather violent motion) of a sudden he being asleep, there entered into his Chamber, half a score of armed Souldiers, who coming to his Bed-side without any ceremony, (he being already wakened by the noise) told him, that as he had broke the bonds of confidence, which the Army might have in his truth and integrity, not onely in treating with other interests, without their privity and consent; but also in practising an escape, contrary to their expectation; so must he not expect from their usage, such civilities, as heretofore he had enjoyed, from the Souldiers present power and jurisdiction. As the King had not boldness enough in his own nature, to deny in the general his intentions: so had he not so much opinion of any satisfaction they intended to afford him, as to enquire further after the particulars of his misfortunes: Wherefore he told them, he was ready prepared to expect their worst cruelty, without troubling himself or them with any defence, or justification of his actions whatsoever: Although the Souldiers spent not much more time in expostulation with him; yet they let him know, with something a sowre demeanour, that as they brought with them an absolute Commission, to remove the Captain of the Castle from his place and command, in regard he had been too remiss in his office, by giving his person a larger liberty then was intended; so were they also impowred thereby to dispose of him, to straiter lodgings in the Fort, to prevent hereafter other stratagems of escape, prejudicial both to the Army and the Kingdom of Lydia: Euarchus with a kinde of a smiling countenance told them, as they had freedom and authority enough, to use their own pleasure concerning his particular, since he wanted both friends and means, any way to contradict their resolutions, so was he determined without any resistance at all, to obey personally their purposes, and with that presently called for his clothes: When he was ready, they conducted him to upper rooms in the Castle, that afforded him at the most, a few uneven leads to walk upon, for his health and daily recreation: Besides, as they placed certain Centinels, to wait continually at the outward door of his lodgings, so would they permit but their own creatures, more intimately to attend his person. As soon as the King was put (as I may say) in this sorrowful posture, he began more inwardly to reflect, not onely upon the causes of his new restraint, but upon the occasion of the discovery of the late design: In the first place he considered, that as the jealousie of the Souldiers might be distasted, to see him retain so much confidence in the Myssian undertakings, by the means and procurement of the Syrian Monarchy, so was it not in his power as he believed, totally to forsake that interest as yet, in regard he could not build certainly upon the Armies intentions, not knowing very well whether they desired a King or no; wherefore if he should appear in that nature, inconstant to his own many professions, joyned with the perswasion of his Queen Hyacinthia , wholly governed as he supposed by the influence of the Court of Syria , he should not onely incur thereby an unrepairable loss to his posterity, wanting upon all occasions the assistance of that Nation; but also procure to himself a perpetual captivity, in not having any other considerable friends to trust: In the next place he could not well determine in his minde, whether the new stratagem of his escape, was either devised in that manner by his enemies, whereby to have the better ground for his surer imprisonment, or that some unfortunate accident had revealed the design, before it was put in execution; but however these were but onely surmises, that gave the Kings thoughts imployment, for want of better recreations; yet when he did reflect upon these considerations, he would often call upon the Gods goodness for his own relief. O you immortal powers would he say, whose inscrutable decrees are beyond the reach of all humanity to comprehend, although we may not at all doubt the justice of your proceedings in every moral action, much less in those Sacred things, that belong more particularly to your own Divine Worship; yet give me leave in a humble way to expostulate with your goodness, what at the present may be the chief reasons of my suffering; since my ignorance of knowing in some sort your intentions, renders me often, rather desperate in my thoughts, then better prepared to call my self in question for those offences I have committed: was it the greatness of my dignity, when I was gloriously enthroned in my Kingdom of Lydia , that so far dazled the eyes of my soul, that I could not perfectly call to minde, from whose mercy I received so great a benefit? Were those continual pleasures, I enjoyed with so liberal a freedome for many years together, sent me as destroying poisons, either to corrupt my inward parts, or to overthrow all my prosperity in this world? If they were, certainly I shall more willingly entertain the latter with an humble patience, then again return to the other, whereby you might become perpetually exasperated against my duty, or want of consideration. Yet O you Gods, lay not the faults of my whole Kingdom upon me, lest I too cruelly perish, with the weight of my own misery; when as many perhaps are more guilty then my self, (though inexcusable) in those particulars that are onely called my actions. Wherefore I most humbly beseech your mercies, not to deliver me to them to be punished, who can as little claim an interest in the true principles of your service, as any of my own family, who have most tasted the bitterness of your displeasure: Must I, and none but I, answer for the crimes of the whole Nation? without so much as being declared a Martyr for my suffering, whilst others are esteemed good, because they continue their prosperity, and my self held a criminal onely, because I am unfortunate. O you heavenly powers, mistake not my intentions, or disdain my supplications; since as I do not any way presumptuously prescribe you rules, or as little doubt your indifferency in judgement, so shall I be ever most passionate to see, the world converted rather then punished, wherein my self may hope also to be numbred. Whilst the King had liberty enough, both for these complaints and other devotions, (since for the most part his conversations, were onely the solitary whisling of the winds from the vast body of the Sea, that in a manner incompassed the melancholly Castle round about, and the violent beating of the Waves upon the sides of the Rocks, that lay under his Chamber window, which often afforded his sorrowful ears unwelcome noises) Gyges, Scinon , and Iris , conceiving these late violences they had used in the City of Sardis , without farther proceedings, might either endanger their persons, or frustrate their designs, wherefore met one night with others of the same faction in the Temple of Dis , not many furlongs without the walls of the Town; where after they had taken each other by the hands, with faithful promises of their future constancy, Scinon being the most violent and active in the company, began to declare his thoughts and opinion in these words. Fellows either in happiness, or misery, said he, can it be thought that Euarchus life, will ever warrant our condition, much less justifie our actions, whose bewitched affection to his ungrateful Countreymen (the unworthy Myssians ) hath made him more rely upon their promises, notwithstanding they have so often deceived his happiness, then upon our just deserts, that not onely delivered him at the first from his harsh imprisonment, but gave his condition new hopes of prosperity in the future? If these proceedings are visible, not onely to our selves, but to the whole Kingdom of Lydia , and so consequently the principles to be confest by all knowing judgements, what hopes can we have (if ever he again recover any manner of authority) but sharply to cast the heavy weight of his exasperated malice, according to those dictates our worst enemies shall infuse into his belief, as being the prejudicated objects of all his past conceived miseries and misfortunes? For put case he should for his wished liberty, consent to give us a dissembling pardon for the present, how can we any more trust his hypocrisie in after times, then now be sure either of his affection, or his security; witness his late endeavours to escape from our jurisdiction, notwithstanding his captivity was both gentle and milde? And truly, if he were possessed with such low thoughts, as easily to pardon with fear and trembling, all those losses which he hath sustained by the Armies victories, I should be scarce willing to live under such a Prince, that could so indifferently carry himself between his friends and enemies; but far am I from believing that Arethusius (however Euarchus might be brought by our endeavours, to yield to some poor and contemptible terms, absolutely necessary for the Souldiers present condition) being sprung from the root of so many Monarchs, would ever be perswaded, to seal a confirmation of those conditions, onely extorted (as will be pretended) from his Father, bound hand and foot in chains, without which you know we cannot possibly be safe in the future; since the change of the person (by way of orderly succession) must of necessity put us to the seeking of new pardons, that perhaps may come to be disputed, when we shall have no power at all to defend our interest: Wherefore I say, there is but two things left to our consideration, either to detain Euarchus still in prison, or to take from him his life, there being no mean left between governing and being destroyed; for now we have once drawn our Swords against his authority, we cannot with any safety put them up again, whilst we are sure there is any power left to hurt us; for prosperity and opportunity in the greatest part being joyned together, never forget injuries without requitals. If we fall upon the first, and so consequently keep the King in prison, without any further punishment inflicted upon his person; we know the Kingdom will never rest satisfied with our intentions, since we neither perform the peoples desires, according to their many Petitions, which was to have the old Government restored again, nor yet legally proceed against those we pronounce guilty of those crimes, for which we keep the jurisdiction in our selves: Besides, it is not probable, that those Senators we have lately outed from their places, will ever rest quiet in their active designs, without attempting some new agreement with the King, since by that means onely, they shall hope to get some stronger authority then they have lost, whereby to be rendered as well pardonable in Euarchus thoughts; as also thereby gain a capacity to frame such laws, that of necessity must make us slaves or nothing: For as the violent attempt of the Army upon those people sitting in the Senate (which assembly they would have us esteem more than sacred) can never be forgotten by them and their posterity, so must we also consider how loath the whole Kingdom would be, to esteem the Souldiers judges of their fortunes, according to the determination of the Sword, notwithstanding the Armies courage hath hitherunto onely kept them secure in their prosperity: If Euarchus dye by a just and open condemnation, and the Government, upon his fall, be presently changed into the right, though not power of the people, we shall not onely be safe in our lives and liberties, but may easily give satisfaction to all sorts of conditions; in that we have not until now fought so many desperate Battles, either without a cause or a determination; and the rather will all our pretences seem reasonable to the multitude, since Euarchus hath confest himself to be guilty of all that blood, that hath been shed in Lydia , not onely by the perswasion, but instigation of those enemies of ours, that would now passionately maintain both his person and jurisdiction against our proceedings. By this means we shall gain all the revenues of the Crown to the Armies pay, heretofore spent in nothing but in tyrannical superfluities, to the enslaving of the poor Subject; and be in a better posture thereby, to defend our selves against forreign invasion, and domestick troubles: After which, such laws may be instituted, that shall render the Countrey of Lydia famous to after ages: Give me leave further to say, O you glorious companions in fortunes, that all the mighty Monarchs of Asia , shall not be able to prevent our purposes, since Egypt and Syria are so outrageously involved, in their own spleenative fury one against the other, upon whom necessarily every other lesser Prince depends, that we shall (being perfectly united among our selves) be able to overcome all seeming difficulties, that rather appear frightfull dreams to weak thoughts, then ominous Comets to strong resolutions, concerning those revolutions we intend: Last of all, to suffer no objection unsatisfied, that may either procure terrour, or cause doubt, as we must endeavour to make the peoples pretended right, the onely basis upon which this Tragedy must be acted, so to satisfie (or at leastwise to perswade) the Island of Cyprus to be contented, if not pleased with our actions in the general, whose conjunction alone we desire in our affairs, I shall endeavour to win Zutphynon the Ambassadour to our party, whose opinions we know, are not much inclinable to any single dominion, that carries not with it a practice of Trade, or a freedom in conversation, whereby all people may be equal in birth, though not by office; and this will be the easier effected, for that the great Haven-Town of Salamine is at present, in open hostility, if not rebellion, against their Prince. These designs, I say, being put in execution with wisdom and confidence, as we shall gain to our selves thereby an immortal name to all eternity, besides a blest security to our persons during our lives; so will other Nations not onely magnifie our proceedings, but probably shall e're long follow our examples, to the better establishing of us and our affairs: However the Gods will be fully satisfied of our actions, according to those Tenents we hold concerning their Worship; though we must not long protract our purpose, since the people at present stand at a maze, to see and understand what may be our further intentions: Wherefore let some amongst us with expedition, gain what interest they can, either in the Senate, Camp, or City; whilst we all labour an universal equality amongst every sort of conditions, whereby the better to win the multitude to our party; and for the Cretans , as they are a comtemptible Nation, so shall we either bribe or beat the Myssians to our purposes. It was not many weeks after this consultation (or rather might it be esteemed a fore-thought resolution, governed by some determinable fate of the Heavens, since the strongest judgements of the times, could not well understand, either the manner or the cause of such unusual proceedings) before Euarchus was removed by a guard of Horse, from his confinement in the Island, to a gallant Castle of his own, seated upon a hill with such a delightful magnificency, that it appeared rather to be chosen for a theatre of pleasure and recreation, then a designed prison for his discontent and condemnation, if the sequel had not proved more ominous then was expected, both by himself, or almost any other, since the place pretended not so much to strength as beauty. The circumference of the Fort took up in measure near eight furlongs in ground, divided by many partitions of stately buildings, which made notwithstanding divers Cours of different largeness, wherein was erected a goodly Temple, belonging to the Knights of the Lydian Order , whose supream Governour was onely the King himself: As sundry Parks at a convenient distance, furnished with orderly Groves of Wood, for the more delight of exercise and hunting, added another grace to the Majestick Castle, so did the great River of Pactolus with serpentine turnings, enrich those green Meadows, that nature had placed not very far from the foot of the Hill, wherein also for the pleasure of the eye, and the commodity of the Countrey people, there continually grazed multitudes of Cattle of all sorts, that could afford a convenient benefit to the industrious Farmer: This was encreased, by those luxurious Fields of Corn and Vines, that bordered every where the verdant pasturages; and the more assurance did it give of consent to the painful Husbandman, in that the River all the way to the populous City of Sardis , was capable of bearing such Barks for transportation of the fruits and other productions of the Countrey, that the Owners could never despair of a fitting or speedy return: Certainly these enticements of nature (which formerly the King had enjoyed with so much freedom and satisfaction) would extreamly have augmented his vexations, if something more then an ordinary courage and resolution in his heart, had not continually beat down all the vain operations of such disorderly and humane passions: Being there, I say, he was not seldom tempted by many insolencies of such, that had not been often accustomed to the use and conversation of Majesty, whereby the better to bring him a little from his own dignity and determination; sometimes the Common Souldiers also, would in their discourses affirm before his presence, that the Gods and nature intended no difference between persons, in that all were alike endued with the same priviledge of soul, not to be circumscribed in their professions of divine Worship: Otherwhiles his Keepers would rudely enter into his Chamber at unseasonable hours, to disturb him in his rest, or other accustomed employments, then again would they sit down by him, with such a kinde of demeanor, both in their words and actions, as shewed they were not willing to afford his Kingly Titles any reverence or respect at all; besides often was his diet, or the way of it lessened in a high measure, with many other impertinencies, rather to be wondered at then mentioned. One day whilst Euarchus was sitting sadly alone in his own Lodgings, as it might be thought contemplating the uncertainty of all worldly concernments, since himself in a very few years had tasted so abundantly of felicities and crosses, Cratus the Ambassadour of Cyprus , came sudenly into his presence, having as it should seem gotten leave to visit him. After he had saluted the King with a few chearful complements, accustomed in the like cases, (all the Guard being retired out of the room) he told him, that it was his fortune not many dayes since, being privately in a secret place contrary to the parties expectation, to hear a discourse that passed between Zutphynon his own fellow Ambassadour, and one Scinon , lately as he said, or at the present a Senator of the great Senate of Lydia , which as he remembered, was much to this effect. My Lord Zutphynon , said Scinon , as the great and vaste Territory of Asia may bless the wisdom of your rich and fruitful Island of Cyprus , for having framed the first grounds of a Commonwealth, whereby the Tyranny of a hereditary Monarchy might be conveniently opposed, so I hope the world, and you your selves e're long will be satisfied with our intentions, in endeavouring the same thing by the like rules of practice, to confound all oppressions of that nature, in an orderly course of justice, which being done, we in Lydia may also purchase a happy liberty to us and our posterity. If the consideration of a free peoples felicity, with the earnest desires of those that wish to be at liberty, may take place in your thoughts, before the usurped power of a wilful Tyrant in cruelty, we shall joyfully go hand in hand, to the finishing of this laudable work, whereby both Countreys may not onely possess a secure freedom, but a beneficial Trade to each people; whilst in the interim the mediterranean Seas, shall be continually covered with our gallant Fleets, to the no small terrour of those enemies, who will no doubt endeavour to oppose our proceedings: But of the contrary, if your people shall be carried away, with an unseasonable (and I may say) a preposterous love to your now Duke, onely because his Fathers actions, are as yet fresh in your memory, my words will be as vainly employed in the present, as undoubtedly your sufferance will bring repentance in the future: Do you not see apparantly how the insolencies of young Narcissus encrease with his authority? Witness his now carriage against your Town of Salamine? Can it be otherwise thought, but that his youth and ambition, precepitately will still hope by the affections of that Army, paid onely with your money, to become master in effect of the whole Island, of which hitherunto both he and his Ancestors bore nothing else but the name and Title? Wherefore I say, banish Arethusius out of your Dominions, and suppress Narcissus greatness amongst you, whereby we may live happily, according to those ancient rules of friendship, that have formerly been practised between both Nations; which cannot be continued by suffering a Monarch in either Countrey. These words, said he, I heard delivered to my Companion by this Scinon ; but what answer was again returned by Zutphynon , I cannot well inform your Majesty in regard he spoke something low; onely in the conclusion (as I understood him) he assured the Senator, that as he knew many of the Inhabitants of the Island of Cyprus , would thank him for his advice, concerning their own Duke Narcissus , so of the other side, for his part he was resolved, not to meddle with the affairs of the Kingdom of Lydia , either belonging to yourself or the people, otherwise then what might stand with the good liking of the Senate and the Army. The King as he had been very attentive to this relation of Cratus , so after he had made an end of his discourse, with two or three deep sighs he seemed to lament his own condition, in that he had neither power to govern by his own authority, (that the people might become happy in present) nor would they believe his intentions, that they might in the future be freed from slavery, After the King had rested some pretty space in a muse, he desired Cratus to adde another humanity to his former courtesies, which was, if it were possible, to procure leave of the Senate, that an old Flamin , named Hephestion , most perfectly known to themselves, both for the holiness of his life, and his contempt of worldly concernments, might be permitted to accompany him in his daily devotions, during the strict time of his imprisonment; which was an obligation (as he said) his greatest enemies owed to the immortal Gods, as well as himself. Cratus with tears in his eyes for some certain time, as it were, stood in a maze, considering that so great and mighty a Prince as Euarchus had been not many years since, should now be forced to make use of the interests of strangers, to procure him those liberties from his own Subjects, that the meanest sort of people in Lydia freely enjoyed: But the Gods however they are alwayes just, yet are they inscrutable in their decrees. In fine, Cratus took his leave of the King, and within two or three dayes after, Hephestion the religious Flamin was suffered, as I may say, to remain his continuall Companion, both in divine and moral exercises: But the old Father, instead of giving him worldly consolations belonging to earthly Crowns and Dignities, perswaded him to those entire patiencies, that might place him securely amongst the Gods, where he should not need to fear, as he said, either the uncertainty of his own condition, or the persecutions of other persons; for every thought would be calm and sweet to all eternity: Nevertheless, what assurances (said the King) have we of these possessions, when every one pretends to be in the right, both in his belief and proceedings; and consequently, expects the enjoying the benefits promised, notwithstanding they differ as much in their outward comportment, as light doth from darkness; for some are gentle, milde, and merciful, when as others are cruel, proud, and covetous: Perhaps Sir, answered the Flamin, there may be some of that opinion; yet to take off all indulgent conceits from our wavering fancies, that would willingly incline us onely to those appetites we most desire, without seriously consulting with the Principles of Right and Religion, in that for the most part, we cocovet naturally self-satisfaction without looking upon others with indifferency; we must remember there is a punishment and a reward appointed for good and evil: Although I must necessarily grant, replyed the King, what you affirm, in that there is no reason to expect accomplishments, without overcoming difficulties, yet how should we come certainly to know what those principles are which we are obliged to follow, in regard peoples opinions are as various, as their apprehensions are fallacious, and those also being governed by diversity of accidents, make this knowledge of what we are to practise, confusedly, if not entirely uncertain? Truly said the Flamin , I can give but this general rule for instruction, first to observe punctually what the Gods have commanded: Next to conserve an entire charity with all sorts of conditions: But replyed the King; as the first may be very difficult to be understood, wanting an infallible instruction, so the other is of that nature, that it will not be easily put in execution, since provocations must daily arise from wicked people, to destroy in any mortal Creature, that miraculous vertue which you mention: However, I may confess, said the Flamin , that these obligations are something difficult to be used, by such as carry about with them, nothing but fleshy cogitations and worldly desires, yet others again that have a true apprehension of their eternal being, and have tasted really by way of mental contemplation, any part of those joyes we are to expect after this life, may easily be instructed, both what they are in effect, and how they may be obtained, since they will onely consist in these two particulars, in searching the Divine Oracles that have delivered unto us these principles, not onely with a humble spirit, but by the means of those instructors, that are appointed by the immortal Powers to be our teachers: The other to do unto others in all things, as we could wish should be done unto us again; which in effect, is all the substance of the Laws we are enjoyned in this mortal habitation, that is to say, to sacrifice to the Gods with a pure intention, and absolutely resolve never to wrong a third person. O you immortal and heavenly powers, said the King, what injustice have I offered to others, whereby to deserve these afflictions? Or what injuries have I not received to procure mercy? And yet said the Flamin , notwithstanding you endure many more crosses of what nature soever, you are notwithstanding to observe in a manner continually, both a perfect charity, and an entire patience, since as the one belongs wholly to the better Worship of that true God of Heaven, that created first all things for his own pleasure, that expects to have his will obeyed without the least contradiction, so the other according to the Rules of morality, appertains to the conservation of his Creatures upon earth, for his more ample service; neither in this particular, is there any difference between a King and his Subjects; for however by way of accident and conveniency, the one was ordained to command, and the other to obey; yet in the inner parts, the same intentional humility and vertue is to be observed by all manner of persons whether great or small, in regard of the incomprehensible benefit we are to hope for to all eternity, after this short life of ours shall be ended. Wherefore, Sir, as your heroical vertues will be apparant to all the world, by a majestick patience in your outward suffering, since the contrary can no way prevent your oppression, but rather encrease the misfortune, so let not any inward passion of revenge or hatred, deprive your soul of those everlasting joyes, that will establish you a most glorious King for ever, in recompence of that contemptible Crown, you may perhaps lose here upon earth a little before your time; which I must needs call it, in regard that your meanest Subjects have such power and jurisdiction over it. As the King gave a most attentive ear to all the old Flamin said, which he intended in his secret thoughts to employ to the better service of the Gods: so was it not many dayes after this discourse, e're he was conveighed to another Fort near the City of Sardis , where he soon received summons to appear before certain Judges, appointed as 'twas said for his Trial. To this purpose there was designed a large Hall in the great City; at the upper end whereof was erected a new Tribunal, to be fenced on all sides with divers Companies of Foot, whilst Rails on either part made a convenient passage to the very gate, whereby to keep out both the persons and disorders of the multitude; whose curiosity more then their pitty, as 'twas supposed, made them desire to be earnest spectators, of that which no President ever until then, had or would again make them capable to behold. Euarchus one whole night before this intended appearance, (his private devotions being finished) consulted with himself what was best to be done, both in regard of his own dignity, which he believed was not to be questioned by any Authority upon earth, much less by the people of his proper Nation, that were accustomed to derive their priviledges from his grace and allowance, and also what should be the nature of his accusation; since he conceived his actions free, as well as his intentions from those crimes, that usually condemn other persons? Of the other side, when he began to consider, what Cratus the Ambassadour of Cyprus had delivered unto him, concerning the communication between his fellow and Scinon , he doubted there was some ill means to his person, that probably could not be avoided by any industry of his: Nevertheless, oftentimes would he be contented to perswade himself, that it was impossible for humanity, to use him with too much rigour, since he knew his own resolutions were alwayes, to shew what mercy and forgivenesse could be desired to his greatest enemies, both in the general and the particular; then would he pray earnestly to the immortal Gods, that if it were absolutely their heavenly determinations, he should suffer indignities, contrary to the Rules of Morality and Civility, that they would not onely grant him a convenient patience, whereby he might the better carry himself like a King in his afflictions, but that they would also notwithstanding, preserve the rights of his Wife and Children to after ages for the good of Lydia's Monarchy: As the Kings fates seemed, in the eyes of many people, to draw him on to his last period, however there were not a few of another opinion, since by what reasons or policy such proceedings could be, none could well judge; so one morning after the summons was brought to his knowledge, there came an Officer of the Army into the Kings Chamber, with a large commission to conduct him (as he said) before those persons who were appointed by the authority of the Senate (representing all the people of Lydia ) to hear his cause, belonging to those many crimes that would be laid to his charge, as well for the much innocent blood, that had been shed in the late wars, as also in regard of other high offences committed by himself during the time of his Government. Notwithstanding Euarchus might be sufficiently troubled at this unexpected information, wherein both his life and honour seemed to be questioned, by those he supposed could have no jurisdiction, either over his dignity or person, yet was he constrained (in a manner without any dispute) to yield to their Commands, in that the Officer appeared hasty enough to discharge his duty, concerning the Injunction. To which purpose the Souldiers of the Guard, presently marshalled themselves two by two before the King, with some others also of the same Company to bring up the Rear. Thus I say, they marched towards the place designed for his Trial, whilst in the interim he saluted the admiring people of either side, all the way he passed by, as 'twas observed with such a majestick humbleness, that it might easily be conjectured, he still conceived himself to be King, notwithstanding his captivity and misfortunes: When he came into the Court, he fixedly beheld those that were to be his Judges, though with such a countenance, wherein appeared neither hate nor contempt to their persons, as having never before been acquainted with their qualities or conversations; which being done, he sate down in a Chair there prepared for him, with a look that tasted more of sorrow then fear, whereby to expect a further issue of the proceedings: In short, after his many accusations were read, they wisht him in the behalf of the people of Lydia , to confess or deny the truth of the allegations, that they might proceed to his Trial. Euarchus a little smiling at such a demand, told them, that as he esteemed his person free from any questioning of the people, so was he resolved to make them no other answer, then that he was their King, and could not be judged by them. The Judges when they had a short space consulted one with another, the chief in authority amongst them made this reply; That if he continued obstinate in that resolution, they would without any further expostulation proceed to his condemnation; however, to let the world see, as he said, how much mercy and justice they intended in their proceedings, they would for some dayes longer respite the sentence, hoping in the interim he might be converted to more reason, or lesse obstinacy. This brought the King back again to his Lodgings, where being entered into his private Chamber, he cast himself presently down upon his bed, accompanied by many of those humane passions, that are accustomed to be used in actions and troubles of this nature, unto all which the old Flamin applied the best remedies he could by religious perswasions, that consisted for the most part of contempt of worldly things, in comparison of such as shewed the way to a perfect and eternal blessedness: When he had done, leaving the King in some settled quietness in his thoughts, he retired for the consolation of his own melancholly apprehensions, into a private walk between the prison and the wall of the Castle, where of a sudden having scarce made two turns in his solitary perambulation, but he heard his name called upon, by a person in a lower room belonging to the Fort; wherefore approaching to the place (to be better resolved) out of a strong Iron Grate, he might perceive a countenance, and that countenance was soon brought into his remembrance, to be the same (however now much decayed) of Arranus the Myssian General, taken prisoner by Hercrombrotus , in the late Battle that was fought between both their Forces, whose acquaintance and conversation, the Flamin had much used in his Court employments, as a person who had been in extraordinary favour with Euarchus , during the time of his prosperous Government in his Kingdom of Lydia . This sad encounter between these two eminent persons, both having known their Princely Master abounding in all felicity and glory, who was now cast down into so much misery and affliction, procured from either of their eyes tears, as the best congratulation they could use to each other; at leastwise most proper for the season. This for a long time kept them in so still a silence, that nothing seemed to speak but sighs and weeping, as a sacrifice intended to his Tragedy, until at last Arranus being as it should seem first weary of his grief, or rather conceived he had some matter of more consequence to utter, began this discourse to Hephestion the old Flamin . Hephestion , said he, as I know I must die shortly, as well as Euarchus , and the Gods cannot pardon my offences, without the true acknowledgement of my crimes, so will they not be sufficiently acknowledged to my benefit, without an ample declaration what they were, whereby those that have been most concerned in them, may either receive some satisfaction, or at leastwise be desired pardon and forgiveness: In prosecution of which, give me leave to say, that as I hold you most proper of all others, for this work of reconciliation, not onely in regard of your function and interest, but also in regard our good, and sometimes great Master Euarchus , hath chosen you for his fittest Companion in his afflictions; so in respect my own offences have most conduced to his disadvantage, for which principally I expect to suffer, I think my self something happy in this conveniency, whereby I shall conveigh to the Kings knowledge by your means, those passages that may concern either his honour or his posterity; if not, at leastwise, I shall go to my grave with better satisfaction and content. In the first place therefore you may know, that as my birth gave me the most eminent estimation amongst my Countreymen in the Kingdom of Myssia , so was my youth ambitious enough, both to know my own fate, and to attempt the greatest, could be obtained in that barren Region: In prosecution of which, as soon as my years almost afforded me a capacity to understand what I desired, hearing of a famous Oracle in our Countrey, I went presently and consulted it: Within two or three days by the chief Priest of the Temple, whom I had most bountifully rewarded, I was returned this answer.  A bloody stroke shall sure destroy your King, But you must him succeed in every thing: Wherefore go on, and fear not for to see, The last period of the Gods Decree. No sooner had I received this determination of the Heavens, but I went home sufficiently satisfied in my minde, that however King Euarchus might perish, yet my self was as I believed, certain to succeed him in all his honours and dignity; though I resolved to communicate my thoughts to none, but to those intimate friends, that I conceived necessary to make parties to my interest and fortunes. After this resolution of the Oracle, I remained not long in the unfruitful Countrey of Myssia , since Euarchus having newly married his fair Queen Hyacinthia , there waited continually in the glorious Court of Lydia , multitudes of Nobility of both sexes, amongst whom onely riches and honour, as I thought, was to be purchased by youthful endeavours; neverthess upon my arrival there, although I found my self by reason of my birth, sufficiently esteemed and favoured in the Kings inclinations, yet in regard he had then an intimate Minion named Vilerius , who in a manner governed all his actions and determinations, I found it was impossible for me, to rise to any eminency in that Kingdom, without the Favourites more then ordinary approbation; wherefore I resolved, not onely to court his affections in a most high measure, but also addicted my thoughts (according to some intimations were gigiven me) to fall in love with one of his near kinswomen, who I must confess, was of sufficient youth and beauty, both for my desires and condition? But yet however I made my addresses in all Complements, according to decorums of that nature, nevertheless I would not make any agreements without befitting conditions, answerable to my quality and expectation; and that was upon my marrying the Lady, to have places of benefit, and honour in Court conferred on me, equivalent to a considerable portion: In fine, as these conditions at last were agreed between Vilerius and my self, so were the nuptial Ceremonies in the City of Sardis , performed with great magnificence; and the rather, for that the King (in the behalf of his favourite) seemed to confirm all promises that were made, according to my birth and expectation, as well as vouchsafed to be present personally, at the Marriage Feast and Entertainment. 'Tis true, after this, we lived for some moneths with competent content, as of the other side, in much glory, until my ambition, and the Favourites slow performance, caused me at first to quarrel with his promises, and then began to express distastes to my wife; insomuch, as from one private discontent to another, we began at last, openly to defame one another with most exasperated language; he presuming upon the strength of the Kings favour, and I building upon my greatness in the Countrey of Myssia , by the opinion of the Oracle, which I alwayes kept, though reservedly in my minde: But finding after some moneths time of experience, I was not able to make my party good with Vilerius in the Court of Lydia (for which I began extreamly to disdain the Kings person, in that I held my self near allied to him in blood, and therefore could not but expect it in friendship) privately, without taking leave of Euarchus or the Court; I conveighed my self into the Kingdom of Myssia , whereas I knew I had not onely friends enough, to guard my person from all danger and oppression; but also a convenient opportunity to raise what factions I pleased, against the Favourites Government and Authority; and the rather, for that the people already began in that Countrey, to be extreamly distasted, as well at the jurisdiction of the Flamins , as for that themselves and Nobility had lost much of their power in Lydia , since the death of the old King, Euarchus's Father: With these thoughts and resolutions, I say, I went to the City of Lampsacus in Myssia , where being arrived, and coming as 'twas supposed out of Lydia , with sufficient distastes and discontents both in my minde and countenance against the incontrolable power and greatness of Vilerius the Kings chief Favorite, I was soon saluted with the outward best affections of most of the Nobility; which in a manner was as quickly accompanied by the loud acclamations of the people, wholly directed and governed by those Priests that hated the Flamins , in the same equality as they despised Monarchical Authority; insomuch, as finding how much my designs were likely to take with all sorts of conditions, if I could but heap aspersions enough upon Court proceedings; In this manner I proceeded. I first began to tell the Lords, what losses their interest and dignity had in the Kingdom of Lydia , since the death of Euarchus's Father, who ever shewed himself most indulgent to the Myssian Nation; so that it would be high time, as I said, for them, not onely to look after their ancient priviledges, but either to make suit to Euarchus , sometime himself in person, to come and live amongst them, or else to chuse another Governour, however of the same Family or Kindred, that would afford them both countenance and profit, in regard else the barren Mountains of Myssia were not able, to sustain the charges and expences of the encreasing people, having neither sustenance at home, or employment abroad; and the rather as I intimated, for that those Nobility, that were obliged to give their attendance in the Court of Lydia , wanted Revenues to defray their losses abroad, as those that remained yet in the Countrey of Myssia , would be in a manner starved, since scarce any money at all was to be found, wherefore no means whatsoever to augment their fortunes, unless they could procure some native director, to put them in a way of glory or advancement: I possessed next the Priests with an opinion, that as onely Vilerius and the Flamins in Lydia , commanded rather then observed the Kings resolutions, so would both their Religion and Authority in Myssia come to nothing in time, if they should not most industriously labour the people, to complain against the favourites intentions; which were to out the Nobility of their priviledges, as the Gods of their true Worship; since nothing but Luxury and Atheism were practised (for the most part) in the Court of Lydia ; where onely proud Vilerius and his dishonourable Family, ruled every design with power, freedom, and liberty, to the disgrace of the King himself, and all his dominions: Neither did the people want other instigations of envy, to set them a fire against the prosperity of the Lydian Court; and so by consequence were perswaded in a manner to hate their King entirely, whereby another person more conveniently might be chosen in his place, to render them happier in their condition; however in this Office, I must tell you, I onely meant to insinuate my self, although obliquely I pointed at Arethusius the Kings Son, because I knew neither Euarchus his Father, or Hyacinthia the Queen his Mother, would be content to trust his education, in the rude and unpolished Countrey of Myssia , where they could not be assured, either of the safety of his person, or the continuation of his affection: But as I was framing to my own advantage, these secret and particular designs; first to possess my interest with the Kingdoms affections underhand, whereby the better to circumvent my Prince, in the general duty of his Subjects, then to make my self the easier King, according to those ambitious hopes the Oracle had more violently infused into my nature and intention, sudden news was brought me to the City of Lampsacus , of the untimely death of Vilerius , the Kings intimate Favourite, onely by one stroke of a short Dagger, attended by many of his friends and servants, in the very midst of all his honour and glory, to the no small amazement of the whole Kingdom of Lydia . This intelligence I must acknowledge, gave my thoughts many troubles, as my resolution some stop; since I could not chuse but reflect a little upon my underhand practices, which of one side I might very well suppose deserved, as great a judgement from the immortal Gods, as of the other side, I did again begin to consider, whether it would not be more for my advantage, to return into Lydia with probability, wholly to be possessed of my Masters favour; for that now the chief obstacle of my preferment, (as I verily believed) was removed, then to wade further in my new and dangerous attempts, wherein appeared no other certainty, then what proceeded from a fallible Oracle, that perhaps was neither well understood by the Priest, or rightly interpreted by my self. As I disputed within my own breast for many dayes, whether I should still remain in Myssia , amongst my intimate friends and companions, or return again to Court, and prosecute my old fortunes, there came suddenly a Messenger from Euarchus , to invite me into Lydia , with many fair promises of preferment and satisfaction. This quickly concluded all my doubts and fears, with an assured opinion, that I should not onely work all my enemies from the Kings favour, but in a little time, mount into their places and command; at leastwise be possessed of the chief interest in his affection, since there was now none left of a considerable power but the Queen, to oppose my greatness and designs. When I arrived at Court, as I was entertained with a great deal of respect, by all manner of conditions, in regard of the opinion was had of my birth, and alliance in the Kingdom of Myssia , from whence they doubted might come some troubles to the quiet state of Euarchus's Government, so was I presently admitted to be one of the Kings Bed-Chamber, where I began quickly to play my Cards to the best advantage, not onely in enriching of my self and Countreymen, but in winning all those of the Myssian Nation about the Kings person, to depend absolutely upon me or my Faction; insomuch, as this oftentimes occasioned many small quarrels between me and the Queens party, as well in matters of Religion, as in opportunities of profit; whilst in the interim (I having got more then an ordinary interest in the Kings disposition, by reason I accompanied him daily in his exercises, as nightly in a more intimate conversation) I encreased my benefit, by many suits that appeared both burthensome and prejudicial to the Commonwealth; however the disadvantage thereby rather fell upon the person of Euarchus in the generall, then to my self in particular, since I alwayes put on people underhand, to be instrumental in the procurement, whereby I compassed a double end; the one in laying an aspersion upon the Government; the other in procuring still a greater relation to my self, as well in regard of the imployment as the gain. In this manner I say I lived in Court for some years, courting my Countreymen, and enriching my own Coffers to the Kings loss, and the Kingdoms distaste, until hearing that the valiant Prince of Scythia , was newly entered into Armenia , with a powerful Army in defence of the Subjects rights, against Artaxes their King, I began to think, it would be my best way (having got almost what I could in the Court of Lydia ) to conduct some Souldiers out of Myssia , towards his assistance in those Wars, being the readiest means as I thought, both to strengthen my party at home, and to give me an opinion abroad, whereby to be nearer the Crown, according to my aims, whensoever the occasion should happen, as I had been perswaded by the flattering interpretation of the Oracle. 'Tis true, I accompanied that gallant Prince in many of his Victories and Battles, until the Gods were pleased to put a determinable issue to his glory, which gave me opportunity to consult often with my own Officers and Commanders, concerning my own fate and intentions; insomuch, as one day above the rest (finding the Scythian Army could not continue long together, by reason of diversity of faction, after the death of their prevailing General, and so consequently my Souldiers also, that had followed me out of the Kingdom of Myssia , of necessity were to be dismist, unless I could assure them of other imployments, whereby to maintain their persons, and entertain their hopes) I called unto me a favourite of mine, named Ramusius , and after some communication of more then ordinary friendship and affection, I began this serious discourse unto him. Ramusius , said I, as of all others in my Army, I most trust your fidelity, so at present, must I impart a secret of great importance to your knowledge. This is not the first time, that I have acquainted you with the prediction of the Oracle, concerning the fortunes of Euarchus and my self; neither are you ignorant of my ambition in that nature, grounded upon these reasons, that as I am nearest of descent to the Crown of Myssia , so the King for the present not living in the Countrey, it cannot be held much injurious to his benefit, for me to govern, instead of such Deputies he sends as his substitutes, to rule the people in those parts: You see also the Souldiers of our Army must of necessity be disbanded, without much pay or long subsistance; there being no means left for their future rewards, but what must come from my own fortunes; and that at the instant not appearing of a considerable value, in regard of the late untimely death, of our great General the Prince of Scythia ; I should be willing for your sakes onely, to take upon me some new authority, which as you see, the Gods have already in effect designed me, after the expiration of Euarchus: Wherefore if it may stand with the good liking of the chief Officers of my Troops, I shall presently seize upon the Kingdom of Myssia for your advantages, as well as my own safety: and this certainly may be the easier effected, for that we want not many considerable friends of both Nations, that would be very well content, if not assistant to the enterprize, in regard our King is so much addicted to his own pleasure, and the Queens satisfaction, that he cannot be brought to be active in the Wars, either for his own honour, or his Subjects benefit; which hath in a manner rendred him despised, in respect of his cold nutrality, by all the noble and brave Princes of the lesser Asia: As I have thus freely uttered unto you my private thoughts, which I desire should speedily be converted into publick actions, so would I have you impart these resolutions, to whom you please amongst the Souldiers, whereby we may the better come to know their minds in this particular. These were my words (honest and religious Hephestion said he) I used to my friend Ramusius , for which I humbly now implore the Gods mercy, as my Kings forgiveness: but however Rumusius used his best industry, with the rest of the Officers of the Army (who belike were something discontent for want of pay, in that they supposed I had taken much of their money to the enriching of my own private Coffers) he found very few or none at all, were willing to engage in the enterprize; insomuch as I was constrained, instead of enjoying presently a Crown, according to my hopes and expectation, to return again into the Kingdom of Lydia , where after my former custome, I betook my self to flatter the King; onely seeking wayes for my own particular benefit. In these imployments I continued, whilst another Officer of my Army, coming also out of Armenia , began to accuse Ramusius , concerning some speeches he had used in those Wars, to my advancement, and the Kings disgrace. The words and allegations were brought to a publick examination, and dispute for many dayes together, until at last, according to the custom in such cases, a formal challenge passed between the two parties, in regard that no witnesses appeared of either side, whereby to explain the truth. But my self (as you know Hephestion ) being absolutely powerful with the King, not onely procured the violent prosecution to be laid aside, but obtained of Euarchus , that instead of the Combat allowed by the Law of Nations, in accusations of this nature to be performed, as a final determination of the Gods, both the persons were judged to be sent into Myssia , there to remain as close prisoners during the King pleasure. This I thought gave me a new security, to prosecute my affairs again with what industry I could, either in suppressing my enemies, or advancing my friends, wherein I must tell you, I studied with a certain kinde of crafty industry, as well to detain the Kings opinion in a kinde of blinde belief; concerning all those things I both said and did, as also by other insinuations and subtil aspersions, to blast all those (especially the Queen) that gave me fear, they might any way circumvent or hinder my intentions, either in Myssia or Lydia . I thus continued my thoughts imployed in gain, as most of the rest of the Courtiers busied either in profit or luxury, until our Countreymen of themselves began to be mutinous, if not troublesome in a most high nature, not onely against the jurisdiction of their own Flamins , but also appeared exasperated at the Priests power in the Court of Lydia , which as you know very well, soon caused the Assembly of the great Senate at Lampsacus , whither the King presently sent me to appease the stirs: It would be too great a shame for me to tell you, that in that imployment, I rather added fuel to the fire, then cast any milk upon the flame, which made me return, rather with complaints in my mouth concerning the danger, then remedies in my discourses, whereby to render the King pleased, thinking I could best colour my actions in broils and troubles, since I knew my own covetousness already, had procured me a world of hate in both Countries: there will be no need to discourse unto you, how that shortly after this, the Myssians came into Lydia with an Army, when as all those proceedings are already too well known both to you and others: onely thus much I must say, that however Pollinex advised the King, to contend with those Forces come out of Myssia , and not yield to their demands, so much as he said, against and contradictory to his dignity and prerogative, yet my self alwayes prevailed so far in the contrary to those Councels, that Euarchus not onely condescended to the calling of the great Senate of the Kingdom, by which authority he hath been since destroyed in his power; but also was the occasion the King gave way to the slaughter of his faithful friend and servant Pollinex , with the perpetual establishment of that Assembly, by which he hath been since deposed; because I feared else, that Councel would strictly call me to an account, concerning my own actions in Court-proceedings: In this posture affairs remained, whilst the King and the Senate, contended with violence, one against the other in many Battles; insomuch as at last the Myssians were again invited into Lydia with a new Army: whereupon Euarchus putting still his wonted confidence in my integrity, sent me once more into the Countrey of Myssia , to try whether or no I could divert my Countreymen from their resolutions, of giving assistance to his esteemed enemies in the Kingdom of Lydia ; wherein I must tell you, I gave him such strong assurances of my fidelity and power in that particular, that he rested more then confident of the success of my endeavours: however, contrary to his expectation, when he thought himself most assured, that no Forces would be sent out of Myssia to his prejudice, he was advertised by many, that not onely an Army was already marching into Lydia from those parts, notwithstanding I had given him no notice thereof, but also that I had so far complied in the design, with those of the contrary faction, that from my own mouth in many speeches, his reputation was exceedingly blasted amongst the common people. Euarchus could not a long time be perswaded of this truth; yet at last finding such evidient testimonies, which were not to be contradicted, with any probability by all competent judgements, upon my arrival in the City of Philadelphia , where he then kept his Court, (whither I must confess, I repaired with dissembling intentions, as soon as I had perfected my designs in Myssia ) he commanded me presently to be arrested for high Treason, in order to a future Tryal, according to those evident accusations, that were brought against me by persons of quality out of my own Countrey. Notwithstanding all these proceedings, the King was yet so far bewitched in his affections towards my particular, that I had by my Agents almost prevailed with him, to be admitted to a new conference, wherein I doubted not by my subtilty and language, but to have prevailed in my excuses: but they being at last contradicted, by some more powerful influences, I was quickly sent as a guarded prisoner, to a strong fortified Castle in the uttermost Confines of Caria , where the Kings Forces most remained; whilst of the other side, the Senate by some instruments, used all the means they could to retain me alwayes about his person, finding me still as they believed conducing to their benefit and advantage. In that place I say, I was constrained to endure some moneths of close imprisonment, whilst Euarchus seemed in an indifferent way, to contend against the double power, both of the Myssians and the Senate: but when he so far declined in his fortunes, that he was no longer able to bear the weight of his own oppressions, being of every side beset with multitudes of difficulties, he was perswaded again to try my inclinations towards his assistance, intending to make use of my industry another time, to attempt a new diversion in the Kingdom of Myssia , since he very well knew, I was something jealous of Argylius prevailing greatness in that Countrey: with these thoughts and my own faithful promises, I was suddainly delivered from my confinement, assuring the King, as I ever intended him my best services, so those words that I had formerly uttered to his disgrace, I was at that time constrained to deliver, whereby to be the freer from suspicion amongst his enemies: Neither could I (as I protested before the immortal Gods) hinder the marching of the Myssian Army into Lydia . As these things were partly true, so was our credulous King, soon satisfied with my reasons: In this particular, I must needs confess my self highest to have injured Euarchus , for that all the world conceived him weaker in his nature, for the precipitated indulgency he alwayes shewed me, then for any other misses either in his actions or Government, since in most things he appeared even matchless, both for his judgement and apprehension: But again to the matter, after I had a new received his instructions, I hasted my journey into the Kingdom of Myssia , where we heard Monterosus was actually in Arms for the King right against the interest and authority of Argylius and Lycius: There in a short time we performed considerable services, until my own envy to that gallant Lord, and Euarchus commands to us both, to put up our Swords in his quarrel, as conceiving himself now safe in the protection of the Myssian Army, quickly severed us, either from farther contention or more performances, which soon settled me quiet at home in my own possessions, near our chief City of Lampsacus , as of the contrary, it carried Monterosus , whose spirits and courage was invincible, into the Kingdom of Syria . 'Tis true, as he made there many complaints against my proceedings, so that Court being formerly possest with a contrary opinion of my intentions, he had not countenance enough given him by that State, (by reason I had circumvented him in his design) so that he was induced quickly to take his leave of Queen Hyacinthia , and not long after transported himself into the Countrey of Scythia , whereby to procure new Forces that might release our King of that imprisonment, which he understood was lately cast upon him, by the ingratitude and treachery of Argylius: Of the other side my self finding, that not onely Euarchus was delivered a captive, contrary to my expectation into the hands of the Lydian Senate, but also by reason of that unnatural designe, how much Argyllus would be able to out-power me in the Kingdome of Myssia , (if not speedily prevented) I sent a messenger of my own hastily into Syria , as well to offer my service to Hyacinthia in the Kings behalf, as to assure that State, I should be capable in a short time to raise a gallant Army, which in despite both of Argylius and Lycius , would be led into the very heart of the Lydian Territory, whereby again to redeem the King from his captivity. These proffers and assurances were extreamly well received in the Court of Syria , insomuch as within some few moneths, our Souldiers were raised, money was provided, and all other equipages were so conveniently contrived for a march, that we scarce apprehended any difficulty at all, to compass what victories we pleased towards the Kings releasement; and the rather, in regard also we understood, many dangerous factions were already ingendered in Lydia , to our advantage as well as to the Kings benefit: But here I must take leave to say, that however many that have been over willing to augment my crimes, have alledged I onely intended this preparation, the better to have the opportunity, to set the Crown of Myssia upon my own head; I here swear before the Immortal Gods, I had then in my intention no such design: Nevertheless in the way I cannot deny, but I was tickled up by some part of my old ambition, seeing my self Commander of such an Army, and accompanied with so many brave Officers, to consult again with a certain Oracle, which was discovered lately as I was told, in a Temple upon a hill, whereby the likelier as I imagined, not onely to know the success of my present imployment but to be assured of the Kings future fortunes. I arrived at the Temple about the shutting in of the evening, insomuch as I found all the Priests at their last devotions; when they had done, they every one come unto me, to give me some kinde of fitting and civil salutations: After I had a little conversed with them in the general, at last I singled out the chief Governour amongst them, unto whom I not onely delivered a large quantity of Gold, but told him, I was induced to visit that place, in regard of the fame that was lately spread abroad of the holiness thereof, concerning the Revelation of Divine Mysteries; wherefore I desired him, that I might be farther instructed in those wayes, that might lead me to some knowledge of future things, as well in respect of the King as of my self: Having ended this short discourse, he stood for some pretty space in a kinde of a maze, as if he yet made a question, whether it were fit or no to tempt the Gods, before they were pleased of themselves, to deliver voluntarily their own Oracles: and to that purpose seemed by his reply to make some doubt; yet considering how much the affairs I had in hand, concerned the good of both Kingdoms, he promised the next morning, to do sacrifice to that effect to the Gods, provided I would as he said, all the night watch in the Temple according to customs of that nature and consequence. To this intention he brought me presently a stool and a cushion, for my better commodity and ease in my prayers: After he was retired, I addicted my self to my devotions, with what fervour could proceed from my weak faith, (having little confidence in holy things) considering how much my actions had been hitherunto, taken up with worldly appetites, as my thoughts imployed for the most part in nothing, but in vain and weak ambitious, belonging alone to my own greatness, without reflecting at all upon other persons particulars: In the morning something early, after a large sacrifice was first performed to the Gods, however without those ceremonies used in the Lydian rites, the Priest carried me into a dark Chappel, where the Oracle was most accustomed to speak, in those difficult matters belonging properly to my purposes; where I had not remained for any long time, before a suddain and whistling winde was heard all over the room, with two or three loud cracks of thunder, not onely to the astonishment of my self, but in some sort to the amazement of most of the company; however, the Priest told me, that such signs were infallible predictions; that the Gods would give speedy answers to all our demands: We had not remained much longer in expectation, before the Oracle upon the Altar pronounced this sentence, though first all the company but my self and the chiefest Priest, were commanded out of the Chappel.  In Triumphs great thou shall conducted be, To meet the Kings unhappy destiny; Whose House, and Guards, and Fortunes all along, Thou shalt possess, or feel by right or wrong; Whilst Arethusius must in Forreign State, Avoid by Banishment his Father Fate; Yet shall with hopes come back to us again, Though forc't by Flight from thence before he Reign; And scaping Treason, the Gods have something more, Which I for after times will keep in store. Although I must confess, I was something terrified, in the manner of the pronouncing of this Oracle, notwithstanding I was told it was the custom of the place; yet when again I considered the substance of the Prophecy, that not onely answered my expectation in the former Oracle, but plainly advertised my ambition, that however Euarchus appeared to be threatned with a dangerous and desperate fate, yet my self in all probability, was to succeed him in his honours and dignity, I became sufficiently pleased, if not absolutely fortified in that imployment I had undertaken for the Kings service, by leading the Army out of Myssia into Lydia , which now I intended to convert to my own advantage, since I thought Euarchus's misfortunes, were no way to be prevented by any humane industry: wherefore presently taking my leave of the chief Priest, having first given him thanks, and bestowed other large recompences upon the Temple, I followed as fast as I could my marching Army, hoping ere long by some glorious victory, in triumph to be conducted through the streets of Sardis , and by the willing consent of the people, I might be forced to take upon me all, or some part of the Kings Authority, until as I thought his unhappy death (according to the words of the Oracle) might put me in possession of the rest, whilst in the interim his Son Arethusius was to seek other fortunes in strange Countries, both with hazzard to his person, and ill success in the prosecution: Thus Hephestion said Arranus , were my flattering fancies, carried up in the air to my perdition, since ambition to my own particular, far outwent, either my good nature or obligation, to my Prince, which as the Gods have punished sufficiently, so I hope the Heavens will no more remember, since I now make unto you this ample confession to that purpose; and the rather am I more confident in being truly converted in my thoughts: Wherefore as I finde the King must infallibly die, according to the predictions; so can I also clearly interpret, as I believe, most of the Prophecies, of both Oracles concerning my self: You know I quickly lost the Battle to Hercrombrotus , Lieutenant General to Farezius , and was shortly after with most of my Souldiers, conducted in a certain kinde of disgraceful triumph, to this house where we are now both prisoners, which was once a glorious Palace of the Royal Family: So that by a seeming fatal encounter, both my self and the Kings are met, onely to act the like Tragedy one after another, attended by the same Guards and Fortunes, wherein, as it is to be supposed, I shall succeed my great and good Master: To shut up this sorrowful and unhappy story, with the confidence I have in your charity and the Kings mercy, I must conjure you by every thing that is to be esteemed holy in your profession, as also by all the hopes we have of Arethusius being prosperous hereafter, that you will not onely signifie these passages to Euarchus , but obtain of him forgiveness for my offences: I must confess I have made the rather this ample confession unto you, that my name after my death, may not be too much blasted in the worlds opinion, since I had no intention in all my last endeavours, either to betray the Kings concernments, or to advance my own particular, any more then to be able to contend with the greatness of Argylius in Myssia , whom I was assured, hated the King as much as my self: With these words he ended his discourse, accompanied by many sighs and tears, which kept them both for a long time, in such an extasie of sadness, as if neither of them any more intended to return to any manner of joy or comfort; until Hephestion considering at last as a more nearer duty to his profession, the King might have some present need of his assistance, towards his eternal end, which he perswaded himself, could not now be long prevented, since he had been so largely made acquainted by Arranus of the Gods decrees, with a kinde of an overflowing discontent in his eyes and countenance, he took his leave, after he had promised to fulfil his request, in every particular that was required at his hands, needful to be related. Hephestion , as soon as he was parted from Arranus , began more seriously to consider, how much of this relation he should impart unto the King; for as he believed the whole discourse, would extreamly trouble the necessary settlement of his thoughts, against that Combat he was shortly to make with death and the world, two inveterate enemies to the quiet state and felicity of mankinde; so was it of the other side, as he supposed, a little needful, to reconcile Euarchus to all those in general, that had most injured him in the transaction of affairs, during his Prosperity and Government: Besides he esteemed it convenient, to let him know something concerning Arethusius fortunes hereafter, whereby the better to prevent those treasons, that might be intended to his person; if not by letters and other messages, to signifie to Hyacinthia his Queen in Syria , how much he was assured he had been betrayed by the Myssian Nation, and especially by Arranus , whom he most trusted of all others. To this purpose, I say, he resolved to inform Euarchus concerning the prediction of the Oracles; which discourses notwithstanding, he designed to mannage cautiously according to his best discretion, when he should finde how his inclinations were addicted: With this determination he presently entered his Bed-chamber, who being newly wakened from a sound sleep, the King prevented him with this language: O Hephestion , said he, I have lately had a most profitable dream to my present condition; and therefore as I know I must shortly dye, which I could never believe until this hour, I shall as near as I can impart the contents thereof unto your knowledge, as my best and chief director in my afflictions; which was after this manner. Methought (said he) being extreamly incumbered by my many afflictions in my minde, I resolved after divers contentions, what course I should take for my best advantage, to repair to the Phrygian Sybil , dwelling as I understood in a Cave upon Mount Ida: I found the Prophetess at my arrival sitting upon a stone, at the entrance of her melancholly habitation; when she saw me approach, she presently entered the innermost part of her lodgings, whither notwithstanding I followed her with a haste, that shewed I was greedy enough to be satisfied concerning my future fate: After my entrance, I passed through a long Gallery, cut out of the main Rock as I conceived with a stupendious skill and labour; where going through multitudes of intricate windings, I perceived her at last placed against a wall, which was to be mounted by four or five steps: As soon as she saw me, with a fearful and horrid countenance, she prevented me with this language. I know thee (said she) to be Euarchus King of Lydia , wherefore enquire no farther of me concerning thy fortunes, onely I will inform thee, that thy Son Arethusius , with thy other Children, if they can escape some treasons, shall enter in the future upon most admirable adventures: I perceived by this prediction, that my own fates drew me on to the last period of my life, yet I earnestly importuned her to a fuller satisfaction: notwithstanding she was resolved to speak no more in my particular, nevertheless the next morning she promised to shew me divers mysteries belonging to Mount Ida: I spent that night with no sleep, though much trouble, until the Prophetess having clothed her self in a white vestment, with her hair about her ears, striking me a little with a wand she carried in her hand, commanded me to follow her presently up the hill from the mouth of her Cave, at the very bottom of the Mountain: We had not made a journey of many furlongs together, before the skie became intirely obscured by a dark mist, from whence proceeded within a short space many flashes of lightning, that afforded us clarity and conveniency enough, to behold a deep Valley, wherein were contained many miserable persons tormented by furies, that seemed to have neither compassion of their afflictions, or consideration to their cries; but rather added new torments to their mindes by telling them, that whilst they lived upon earth, in their covetousness and ambition, they had little pitty and regard of those, that suffered injuriously by their falshood and oppression: No sooner were these words spoken, but the furies with a certain new violence, cast their bodies from one flame to another in so terrible a manner, that my own heart also began to faint with the very apprehension, however, I felt neither their pain nor despair: As I was quickly weary of beholding these horrid spectacles, so the old Prophetess, finding my fear and terrour, told me, that she intended to shew me upon the top of the Mountain, objects of a more delightful and pleasing nature: As we ascended the hill, by little and little, the mist vanished, until at last our sights being absolutely cleared from all incumbrances whatsoever, we beheld at no great distance, a most beautiful and admirable Countrey, that seemed to be illustrated by the clarity of a thousand bright shining Suns; such as no mortal eyes were ever accustomed to behold: From this delicious habitation, there also issued forth most ravishing musick, that appeared at the instant to charm my senses in such a nature, that for the present I must confess it took from my desires, all appetites of this inferiour world: The buildings were intermixt with nothing but gold and precious stones, whilst winding Rivers of pure Christal, gave the flourishing Trees and green Meadows a new fertility, not to be described by any humane art or memory: It was about a quarter of an hours time (remaining all that while in an extasie, and transported with a perfect delight) that I continued my looks fixed upon those heavenly miracles, until at last the Prophetess taking me by the left arm, she let me know, that as the place was onely reserved, for such as were no injurers, who with a quiet patience were content to forego this life, and the fond vanities of the earth; so for the present, could she not any longer suffer me to behold that absolute mansion of wonderful rarities, that were alone instituted for the reward of the blessed when they were dead, though not at all for the living, either wedded or in love with worldly things: When we descended again the hill, she farther informed me of the youth and beauty of the inhabitants, being such as she said, who had most victoriously strived with flesh and blood, against all the ambitious and sensual passions of mortality; who were designed in a most entire unity, for ever and ever to remain in that glorious habitation, praising and giving thanks to the great God that had created those excellencies, as a perpetual reward for their sufferings and afflictions in this world; either laid upon their persons by their cruel enemies, or willingly undertaken by themselves, as greater marks of their gratitudes, and constant affection towards his services: Having delivered thus much to my apprehension, the Prophetess vanished instantly from my sight, which suddainly wakened me from my dream. And now I must tell you Hephestion , this hath not onely (whether it were a revelation or a fancy) assured me, that I must die within a very short space, but hath also so far quited my thoughts of all worldly considerations, that I finde my self in a manner prepared for the hour, whensoever, either the Gods or my enemies shall call me to the Combat. Hephestion finding by this manner of discourse, that the Kings thoughts were sufficiently settled towards his final destruction, supposed it would not be unprofitable to that purpose, to make him acquainted also with the relation of Arranus ; so that using some circumstances necessary to the business, instead of a preamble, he let him know in a manner, all that had passed between them in their conference; Euarchus cryed out suddenly, O you Gods, is it possible, that my credulity and goodness, have been so much abused by those, I not onely most trusted in my affairs, but were best rewarded by my benefits: For ever let the Myssian Nation be ashamed of their ingratitude, as my self guiltless of their crimes. The Flamin presently added, that notwithstanding his sufferings had been intollerable, occasioned principally by the underhand practices of that people, yet it was his duty towards the service of the Gods, to pardon them with all others, who had done him most injury: I do, I do (replyed the King) and since I finde not onely by your intelligence, but also by my own dream, that I must shortly leave this untoward and troublesome world, I do conjure you by the holiness of your function, accompanied by the integrity of your disposition, to inform me concerning the nature and property of that great God, that first created the world for his service, as to the benefit of mankinde; for that by the very rules of reason, it seemeth unpossible that numerous Deities can be omnipotent: Your Majesty, said the Flamin , hath made a most profitable objection; for however we number up in our daily devotions several Gods, yet were they no other at the first then such persons, that lived upon earth with fame and renown, by whose valours and heroical actions, the people in the infancy of the world received notorious benefits, however by corruption of the times, they became at last deified in their opinions: Why then (said the King) it should seem, we have been hitherunto continued in a most gross and dangerous errour? It is true (replyed the Flamin ) many cannot be excused in that particular, without the pretensions of an invincible ignorance: But I pray (said the King) what may be the Attributes of this omnipotent God, that onely we are to serve and worship with our best thoughts? This great God (said the Flamin ) is all powerful in his works, pure in his intentions, and unalterable in his decrees, whose Goodness, Majesty, and Divinity, most be worshipped with victims and sacrifices, not given or belonging to any of his creatures, how great and excellent soever: What is the reason then (said the King) that we honour so many other Gods of an inferiour nature? we do not (replyed the Flamin ) bestow upon any of them, those Attributes that belong properly to his Essence; onely sometimes, we serve and call upon them perhaps in our extremities, as vertuous people that lived once upon earth, who now enjoy a perfect fruition in his favour, wherefore more apt to procure for us, those benefits we desire (according to some opinions) in regard of our own unworthiness, although that practice is not approved on, generally in the customs of Lydia ; much less are we to worship many Gods, being an enormous crime crept into the world, by the wickedness and ignorance of mankinde, for want of true knowledge and fitting instruction; however all agree in these two principles, that this God is to be honoured with a Divine Worship; as also that we ought to forgive those that have injured us, in an intire manner; without either of which, it is impossible to secure our present or future condition. As the King presently after this communication, entered into his own private Cabinet, whereby the better to make use of this wholesome instruction, which set before his imagination a more lively way, to know the vain uncertainties of this inferiour world; so when he was seated in his solitary retirement for contemplation, he fell upon the considerations of his own troublesome reign, that scarce had given him in the latter part of his life, one hour free from vexation and discontents. First he reflected upon the extream ingratitude of his own natural Countreymen the Myssians ; a people of all others, that had been most beholding unto him for his bountiful favours: Next he entered into examination of his proper actions, with his more inward intentions, concerning his Subjects of the Kingdom of Lydia ; as it were imagining, why they should now seek a new way of Government to their own prejudice, when as his reign had been ever so gentle and easie unto them? And here a little he began to stumble at the Gods goodness; but then when he considered how inscrutable and just were all their decrees, notwithstanding the various imaginations of man that were onely accompanied by indulgent fancies, instead of true interpretations, he thought himself as faulty in many of his comportments, as Crowns and Dignities were uncertain to be continued; and when best and longest to be enjoyed, nor be compared in any kinde whatsoever, to those heavenly pleasures, which in his dream he had beheld upon Mount Ida: But however by little and little; he endeavoured to wean himself in this manner from worldly considerations, yet he could not altogether put off from his thoughts, the desire of earthly prosperity for his dear Wife and lovely Children, which for a season, caused him to shed many tears, as offered sacrifices of sorrow to their love and remembrance. This also caused him in a kinde of extasie of passion, to fall down upon his knees, and earnestly beseech the Gods in their behalfs. In this diversity of passions, though still milde and temperate in outward appearance, he continued for some few dayes, until he was another time sent for before his Judges, to make his last and final answer, to those accusations that had been formerly brought to his charge; where being again demanded, what reply he intended to return, he told them once more, that as he conceived they had no just authority, either from Heaven or Earth, to be the disposers of his person, much less the takers away of his life, so was he fully resolved, never to yield to that jurisdiction, which not onely intended to destroy him, but to captivate his people: After his condemnation was pronounced, many Ladies of the City with dishevelled hair, and distracted looks, prest in amongst the armed Guard with violence, to be heard plead for this Kings life. When the noise was something appeased, and the women by force sent out of the Court, as esteemed too impertinent disturbers of the proceedings, Euarchus with a certain gentle admonition of his hand to be heard (which being at last granted him) with a constant grave countenance, though the sweetness of his favour was much decayed, by his many miseries and continual afflictions, made this manner of speech to the Assembly. I hope there are some here, (said he) that are rather sorry for my misfortunes, then contemners of my dignity, wherefore less perswaded of these my crimes then others, to whom I shall onely address those few words I have to say, since I neither can or ever will, acknowledge this jurisdiction, that seems to claim an unheard of authority over my person: You see your King, not onely brought before I know not what Tribunal as a Malefactor, but condemned to die, by a Law never yet put in practice by any power, however grounded upon no other cause, but that he desires satisfaction in the true constitution of the Lydian Government, which ought to be the rules of comportment, both for the Prince and the Subject: You may behold also, a liberty extraordinary given to these men, rather by violence to execute what they please, then justly to proceed in what they should, since the Senate is now no more what it was, then my self when I was Head thereof: If Presidents were to be produced for these actions, certainly they would adde much to the advantage of the cause in the opinion of the people; if none have been in former times, yet at leastwise let them derive their power from some visible Authority, which may appear to have been supream in past ages: If they challenge their Jurisdiction, from the ancient and hereditary Priviledges of the Nobility, where are they themselves to make good the claim? If by the natural right of the people, why are not their consents demanded to justifie the proceedings? But O you Gods, it is the Sword onely (that never was ordained for Government but Execution) by which Euarchus must fall: Alas, alas, my friends, (said he) to what a pass are your Rights come, when the Father of them all must perish, because he desires still to make them good to your posterity? The Judges being unwilling to hear any more of this language; for that the Kings discourses seemed to draw from the Assembly, not onely tears, but consideration even from the Souldiers themselves, who began to be a little softned in their hearts, commanded them instantly, to lead away the prisoner from the Bar, since they perceived his obstinacy was not at all to be reformed. But when this doleful news, was first brought to the ears, of the more then amazed Princess Cloria , of her Fathers death, it was not a grief that possest her sad soul, like unto a humane misery; but she entertained the disaster, as a fatal doom executed against her eternal happiness; insomuch, as presently with a look that prognosticated some strange alteration in her senses, she rowled her fair eyes in her head, as if they sought nothing but the cruellest effects of desperation; till at last wholly overcome by the violence of her distemper, she sunk down to the ground before the Company, whilst those about her (who had been also for the instant, entertaining their own thoughts, with the like sorrow in some measure) were constrained to fly with fearful shreeks to her necessary assistance: They continued a long time rubbing her beautiful Temples, and using other means for her recovery, until in the end, the Gods as it should seem, not willing to permit a Creature to perish of such excellency, by reason of any misfortune, she was again brought to a new life, however much more loathed to her self then death of what nature soever: When she had been for a pretty space seated in a Chair, though rather by the violence and industry of her servants, then by her own consent and sufferance; after she was in that kinde throughly come to her understanding, according to their apprehensions, she had made undoubtedly another war with her lovely face, if the standers by had not suddenly interposed, whereby to prevent the resolution; and by force presently carried her to her bed, where being laid, it was not long before she uttered these complains, with so much passion, as very well shewed what were her inward cogitations, occasioned by the causes of her excessive grief. Alas, alas Cloria (said she) is it fit thou shouldst longer preserve this miserable life, since he that was authour both of that and all thou canst pretend unto, of good and happiness, should be deprived of his by so strange a fate; Will thy most dear and noble Mother, (who cannot but die with sorrow upon the hearing of this horrid news) ever own thee for her Childe in the next world, when she shall finde, thou wantest duty sufficient to accompany thy vertuous Father in his death? What a displeasant encounter will there be, in the Elyzian Fields between our sad souls, attending onely natural expirations, instead of revenge upon our selves or enemies? O dear Narcissus , (said she) seek not now, the contracting of new marriages, with thy most unfortunate Cloria , when as thou art rather obliged, to raise numerous Armies to vindicate her injuries, and preserve thy own condition, lest the example give encouragement to all other Subjects to do the like. After she had uttered thus much, she again rested silent for a pretty space until the tears trickling down her lovely Cheeks in abundance, made another forcible passage for her words in this manner. You Gods, (said she) the blessed Authors of all goodness, and therefore not to be blamed for any of our miseries, give me I beseech you a competent patience, not overmuch to offend your Deities, by my unruly and preposterous passions; nevertheless I must beg leave to declare to the world such a necessary grief, that neither my heart can conceal, or my duty avoid, without a stain to my honour, or an injury to justice it self; with these thoughts and considerations, I cannot but reflect upon the apprehensions of poor Ascanius , who at our last parting never imagined, so suddenly to be saluted with the sad and disasterous tydings of our Fathers fatal destruction by his own people, since he hasted more from my company, to be a glorious instrument of Euarchus prosperity, then out of any fear he had of his own safety: Is it possible that all Princes of Asia will still sleep in a false security, when such examples are permitted to threaten new dangers to their Dignities? If you be chastised for your blinde stupidity, and froward spleens one against another, the punishment is but justly inflicted by the all seeing Heavens, for your follies and want of consideration, in being insensible both of honour and goodness, in your own and others particulars: Now may the Lydian people for ever repent their unfaithful disobedience to that Majesty, that had nothing but sweetness in his Commands, and justness in his intentions, since vulgar pride and covetous fancies, have in a manner destroyed at one blow all property in the Subject: with what derision may the uncircumspect Nobility bemoan their own losses, in not being able so much as to contribute the least assistance to their King in his extremities; and as little to conserve their own priviledges in the Senate? O most dear Mother (said she) once the honour of beauty, and delight of Majesty, with what torments will your noble soul be afflicted, (if you should overlive the first news of this strange slaughter) when you shall not onely consider your self deprived of all personal happiness and content in this world, but finde your thoughts continually perturbated by the cryes and exclamations of your injured, if not wanting Children? She would still have proceeded after this extravagant manner, in beating of the fruitless air with her pure and innocent breath, if Roxana (considering that her complaints were neither profitable for the season, or beneficial to her self) had not suddenly put a gentle bridle to her present passions, by some kinde of discreet perswasion. Alas, Madam, (said she) did you think to enjoy your Father for ever in this frail Tabernacle of Mortality, when death is the certain period and reward of all mens actions, how great or good soever? Wherefore he, by paying a few years ransome before hand, hath prevented absolutely those hazzards, that might have either dishonoured him here, or destroyed him hereafter; whereas he now by a glorious end, hath avoided both, for the security of himself, and the reputation of his posterity: In full confirmation of which truth, I pray remember, with what noble and constant courage, he alwayes defended the just Rights and Priviledges of his Crown, against his powerful and most exasperated opposers, as well by private encounters as in publick battles; insomuch (as it is sufficiently known) he earnestly provoked the late General Dimogoras to give him personal meeting, if he durst in a single combat, whereby the differences between himself and the Senate, might be ended without more blood and slaughter of his innocent people. Again I say, with what excellent eloquence, both with his tongue and pen, did he ever perswade his enemies to peace and obedience, not onely for the welfare of his Dominions, but the assurance of their own just rights to all perpetuity? And when neither his admonitions could finde entertainment in the Senates resolutions, or his challenge be accpted by the Generals courage, he gave Dimogoras such testimonies of his policy, and skill in Martiall Affairs, by circumventing his whole Army, that it was thought convenient by his Masters sitting at Sardis , to turn him suddenly out of his place of Command, whereby to make a freer passage for Farezim the now General; whom belike they esteemed either more fortunate in the Wars, or less disobedient to their Commands: Last of all, the King being as you know overborn by a double power, he was both perswaded and constrained, to put himself into the protection of the Myssian Army, where by the endeavours of Lycius and Argyllus , he was sold for a sum of money to his destruction, which probably no foresight could have prevented, since he wanted means any more, to defend his own Rights and Jurisdiction, both by reason of his Commanders corruption, and the Senates circumspection: Yet however, O you Gods, with what a constant patience, did he ever since undergo the diversity of proceedings of his cruellest enemies? Who as I may say, tost him from one prison to another, until they brought him to his last scene, wherein he appeared by all confessions, rather a miracle of nature, then a person subject to those passions belonging to humanity; which for ever will give him a most glorious and lasting Character. Wherefore most dear Lady (said she) dry up those forrowful and wasting tears from your fair eyes, being now as I may say, the onely lights that are left yet shining, within the obscured horizon of unfortunate Lydia , and by the help of these beneficial considerations, I beseech you think, that you have not at all lost a worthy and loving Father, but for some short time onely are deprived of his presence, whereby the better hereafter to enjoy his company for ever, with the more splendour and glory; neither be doubtful in any measure, but that your youthful and gallant Brother Prince Arethusius , will procure so much friendship, and power from the greatest Potentates of the world, (who cannot but esteem themselves sufferers with him in honour, though not in territory) as to be able to regain those Kingdoms into his possession, as are rightfully descended by way of succession to him and his posterity. Governess, (said the Princess) after a sad sigh or two had made the way, it is much easier for one to give counsel in health, then for to take physick being sick; especially when as all seeming remedies whatsoever, according to a despairing apprehension, are both unpleasant and distasteful: 'Tis true, I cannot deny, but your powerful and discreet perswasions, are grounded upon so many probable (and I may say) profitable reasons, that I do not see, how my inward malady can possibly be cured, without those punctual observations; yet by the way, give me leave to tell you Roxana , that notwithstanding by the very strength of judgement, you seem powerfully to have convinced my understanding, almost in every particular, nevertheless I finde humane nature (upon what consideration soever) cannot be so soon brought, to put off that frailty that accompanies all our natural actions and conceptions: For although I know the immortal Gods, have created us for better uses, then to place our hearts attentively upon transitory affections, yet as long as we carry about with us the cloathing of flesh and blood, we shall be alwayes inclinable to satisfie (in a high kinde) our outward senses, more then carry up our hopes, upon the wings of Piety and Religion, that pretend onely to divine fruitions, that consist onely in speculation of those contents, we can scarce in any manner comprehend, unless it be after such a dark manner, as Children are made to believe those stories, that are told of Giants and enchanted Castles in the air; for that we have nothing to assist our mortality, but bare faith, and the meer considence we have grounded upon such principles; however I must confess, the little stability we finde in any worldly concernments, affords reasons sufficient to perswade our fancies, that something of a higher nature, then what we enjoy here, must needs be ordained by the pure Heavens, for mans satisfaction in the future; especially when we consider our selves created in a more excellent manner, then all other Creatures whatsoever, by the faculties of our mindes and understanding: Wherefore I say, my dear friend, be not over scandalized at my deportment, if my grief transcend ordinary passions, since the cause appears so much beyond all example. Nevertheless replyed Roxana , I hope e're long, your own reason grounded upon the last part of your discourse (you being the most excellent of your sex, and so consequently in a higher degree above other Creatures) will be of sufficient force, without overmuch difficulty, to destroy those unprofitable passions, that do not onely exceedingly derogate from your own being; but may also perhaps afford greater encouragements to your enemies, as well to prosecute other attempts against your person, as to be less taken with your vertues; when seeing it is in their power at any time to overcome, they will never desist from attempting still, to render you their captive intirely. Notwithstanding these, and the like discourses, within some few dayes, abated many of those violent storms, that at the first raged so exceedingly in the Princess bosom, yet could she not chuse often in her dreams, but entertain her fancy with these manner of imaginations: sometimes her Fathers spirit seemed to speak to her after this sort. O sweet and most dear Daughter, (said he) where are now those flourishing times, that equally made thee delightful to my eyes, as my own power and greatness, that was almost adored by all forreign Princes, as well as absolutely obeyed by the Lydian people? However I conjure thee, to calm those misbecoming tempests for my death, which cloud and obscure the faculties of thy innocent soul, when as there is no doubt but thy own fortunes, will render thee glorious hereafter, by the happy marriage with brave Narcissus , who will secure thee, as revenge me, if once thou couldst break the strong bonds of thy confinement. Then again Hyacinthia her vertuous Mother, would seem to stand before her sight, uttering these lamentable words and complaints. Oh Cloria , is Euarchus dead? Or is it some horrid apparition that suggests such terrour to my imagination, instead of sweet and delightfull objects after all my Sufferings? Could so loving a Husband, and so dear a Father quit this inferior world, without taking his last leave of thee and me? For otherwise perchance, both of us should have been willingly perswaded, to have you along with him into a new Habitation, since for some years last past, we have enjoyed neither felicity or content in this: But is it possible sweet Daughter, (said she) that the just, wise, and eloquent Euarchus , could so easily be supprest by his own people, without the Gods descending from the highest Heavens, to defend his person, and maintain our Rights? O but Hyacinthia , would she say again, this is true, and much more, yet thou still livest, not onely to be a spectacle of misfortune to other Princes, that were once an object of envy to all the Queens of Asia , but a burthen to thy very friends and kindred, accustomed to oblige multitudes of other Nations and Countreys? What are become of so many glories, that daily attended thy person in thy Husbands Court? Where are those Troops of Nobility, who thought it a supream favour, but to obtain employment from thy peremptory Commands? What messenger sent from the mightiest Prince of the world, did not esteem himself honoured to receive smiles from thy countenance, or discourses from thy lips? This and much more did the afflicted Princess imagine to hear from her sorrowful Mother, untill her Brother Arethusius appeared before her fancy in a seeming brave posture, as if he had come out of Myssia , attended by a gallant Army, ready to give Battle to the King enemies: But when her Lord Narcissus was represented to her thoughts, with divers loving vows, and a thousand faithful promises, not onely concerning her affections, but his intentions of assistance, she appeared something confident in those hopes; and with it by little and little, began to take necessary rest and quietness. Thus I say she continued between grief and and consolation, accompanied with other entertainments, that her careful Governess Roxana daily prepared for her divertisement, until Cratus the Cyprian Ambassadour, one day obtained leave of the Officers of the Castle to visit her Lodgings; where notwithstanding, hearing that Cloria was not any in humour, either for entertainment or discourse, desired to have some private conference with Roxana , who presently coming to him, after a few sorrowful Complements, he entertained her with this unexpected discourse. Lady, (sad he) I have by a warrant from Farezius the General, procured leave to visit your Lodgings; yet supposing the Princess Cloria , is not at present much inclinable to communication of any sort, I shall make bold to let you know some passages, that lately happened between me and the said person, which afterward I shall give you leave to judge of, according to your own apprehension and discretion. As I was one day walking in the Park belonging to the Kings House, of a sudden Farezius interrupted my sad contemplations, with this manner of discourse; who belike had noted my melancholly posture, out of his own Chamber windows, that adjoyned upon the place: Sir (said he) as I doubt not but you are sufficiently sorrowful for the late accident that befell the King; so of the other side, you must give me leave to tell you, that my desires no way went along with the action, however my command may appear something in the eyes of the world, to contribute to his destruction: Wherefore, that I may the better satisfie you in this particular, I shall by a short relation make you acquainted with my life and intentions. Scarce had I arrived to competent years of strength and dicretion, but my Father (a Countrey Gentleman near the City of Thyatyra ) intending to give me some breeding, sent me into your Island of Cyprus , there to be trained up in the Wars against the King of Egypt: There I must confess, I so far suckt in the poison of distaste against Monarchy, by reason of those contentions between the people and their King, that I brought home with me thoughts, (I cannot deny) of some disloyalty to my own Prince; as conceiving all Governments confined to a single person, tasted a great deal more of tyranny then liberty; However by a certain kinde of retired life, and no opportunity afforded me for actions, whereby I might conveniently put in practice what I held, agreeing with the tenents of my thoughts and Religion, I was for some years quiet both in my minde and body, untill Euarchus and his great Councel began to contend, not onely in words and disputations, but with Swords and Arms, which latter as I thought being part of my profession, and my opinions also running along with the lawfulness of the cause, I soon took up weapons in my own person, for the defence and justification of the Senate, which from one service to another, hath brought me (as you see) to this degree of preferment. But now to my conclusion: As I was absolutely confident of the Senates right and intentions, in their differences they had with their King, so did I never believe, that things would have come to so bad a period, which I must tell you, no power of mine in the Army, (notwithstanding I was their designed General) could by any industry prevent, insomuch, as finding my interest amongst the Souldiers, not so great, as that which Hercrombrotus and others had purchased by their late victories against the Myssians , I shall be as willing to lay down my Command, as perhaps the Senate hath an intention to take it from me: The reason however, why I have delivered thus much unto you is, not onely to clear my intentions concerning Euarchus fortunes, but to assure you during my time of being in office, I shall use all manner of civilities to that declining party, which is as much as for the present I have to say. I must confess I did not well know what to make of this discourse, and therefore gave him no other answer, but that he might do well according to my opinion, to continue what civilities he could to Euarchus's remaining Family: Of one side as I finde he hath some doubt of Hercrombrotus growing greatness and estimation, so perchance doth it a little repent him, that by his own prevailing endeavours, the King was at first reduced to those hard conditions, that brought him to his finall destructien in the end; however the better to try his inclinations, I desired at that instant, the favour which I have obtained, to visit your Lodgings, and you may make what use you please of the information. Roxana thanked extreamly Cratus for his intelligence; withall telling him, that within a day or two perchance, she might contrive out of it some advantage to the Princess Cloria's condition: When they had spent a little more time in other communications, the Ambassadour took his leave of the old woman, both doubting left the watchful Guard about the Castle, should conceive the present meeting was intended, for another end then for a meer civil and respectful visit, whereby the Kings Daughter might be something comforted, after the loss of her Father. Cratus the Ambassadour being departed, Roxana more particularly began to consider, not onely the consequences of the intelligence, but the fruits of that might probably be reaped, from the assistance and good will of Farezius the General; especially if he were either doubtful of his own continuance in honour, or that he emulated in any kinde the growing greatness of Hercrombrotus , as being a person of a far more active, if not ambitious nature then himself: To this purpose in the first place, she reflected upon her Mistresses sad and almost desperate condition, since as the Senate with the Souldiers had already destroyed the King, so might it be supposed in a short time, they would do the like to the Princess; at leastwise constrain her to some marriage contrary to her liking, in that it could not be thought, either convenient or safe for their purposes, to suffer her to be matched to Narcissus Duke of Cyprus , which probably would give more power to any intentions of revenge against their proceedings, when a title should go along with the opportunity. This made her blame Cloria exceedingly in her minde, to be so over superstitious in her bashful modesty, that she did not consummate the marriage with Narcissus , when she had the occasion offered, setting aside all needless Ceremonies belonging to her honour and duty: Nevertheless considering it was no purpose, to look back upon past accidents and omissions, that could prevent neither future mischiefs, or afford consolations in present exigencies, she began more seriously to tax her own impertinencies, rather considering effectually what was now to be undertaken for the Princes safety. Amongst which thoughts, after she had imagined many things (still controverted by her wavering fancy) at last she fell to this consideration, that without some private escape, it was impossible to avoid the seeming danger: Of the other side reflecting upon the desperateness of such an enterprize, knowing the strict watch was kept hourly, over her Mistresses privatest employments, with the difficultness of her disposition, to be won to such a hazzardable adventure, she began with a little trembling despair, to be deterred from all projects of such a nature; besides, she had scarce heart enough in her own thoughts, to expose the Princess person without other Counsel to desperate actions: With these thwarting considerations, and something a hasty violence, according to the conduct of such passions, as at the present reigned in her troubled breast, between love and fear, she rose up suddenly from her seat, and walked many turns about her Chamber, the better to digest her many several inventions: After this manner in a solicitous muse, she remained for something a long season, not being able to produce any thing worth her own settled resolution, untill at last calling to minde, that her Mistresse would not be long absent from her conversation, especially if she should hear that Cratus had been with her, she broke out suddenly in this language to her self. Fates may be prevented (said she) by the goodness of the immortal Gods: However dangerous maladies must have extraordinary remedies; and I shall esteem my self most fortunate, to have the opportunity to shew my affection to Euarchus Family at any rate; wherefore by consequence I must be more willing to sacrifice my life for the preservation of sweet Cloria's honour: Death is but a due we cannot at one time or other but pay our humane condition, and when we are old it is rather a benefit towards our happiness, then any injury at all to our age: With these words she hasted presently to finde out the Princess, in that she had not prevented her as yet by her visit: She encountered her walking sadly, in an Orange Grove belonging to the Gardens of the Castle; where (after she had a little wakened her from the troublesomeness of her muse) she informed her particularly of the discourses of Cratus , withal intimating, that she hoped they might prevent some dangers to her person, if she could but entertain in her minde competent resolutions; since it could not be otherwise expected from the Senates intentions, then now they had destroyed their King, but they would seek so far to maintain their own safeties, as either to imprison her more strictly then at present, or else endeavour to marry her with some person of an inferiour quality, that might the better assure the Government of Lydia , still to remain under their own jurisdiction: As with these words Cloria began to be possessed with new fears; so Roxana presently told her, that notwithstanding these seeming threatnings, she did not doubt but to invent some project (if she had courage enough to put it in execution) that would soon blow away all dark mists of inconveniency from her particular: And thereupon wisht her to sit down upon the seat belonging to those walks; untill she informed her particularly of her intention; which being done, she began in this manner. Most sweet Lady and Mistress, (said she) as you cannot but be of opinion, that courage and resolution in imitation of your brave Father, befits your birth and quality, so ought you to make most use of those vertues in greatest extremities, without which you cannot be said truly to possess the faculties in your soul; and lesse will they be of any benefit to your princely condition, though bearing never so many Titles in your denomination: what difference is there else between your Nobility and people of a baser extraction? since flesh and blood by nature are the same, onely altering in the resolutions of the minde, gained by a more refined education from one generation to another; which is the reason, I say, why extractions from Kings and Princes, claim so great a prerogative in the thoughts of such, above those of the more inferior sort; whether it be in valour, justice, patience, or the like; because illustrious families have been continually brought up in the practice and love of those excellent qualities, whereas the multitude for the most part, are more carried on by sense and appetite, then by fame and opinion, that seldom or never suffer them to be owners of high exploits: But this I do not alledge, either to instruct your nature, or doubt your education, but the more to inflame your minde, towards the execution of such heroicall vertues, when there is an apparant occasion to make use of them for your advantage, if not safety; which as yet perhaps, you may not conceive so absolutely threatning as I wish you did: I shall desire you but to consider at leastwise my fidelity, (I will not call it good fortune, since we are not yet at the end of our labours) when you were so happily freed contrary to expectation, from the dangerous importunities of Osiris Courtship, in the City of Memphis , which might have produced fortunate effects in your love to my Lord Narcissus , if your overmuch superstition had not hindred the Nuptials; and by that estimate, I pray judge of my present perswasions: I do not say this to upbraid in any kinde your actions past, but the better to instruct your proceedings to come; so that I conjure you to give a willing ear to what I shall now propound. As you have a determination you know, if you can procure the liberty, to send some Messenger or other into the Kingdom of Syria , not onely to condole the lamentable death of your Father, but to enquire after the languishing condition of your Mother; so in the interim, whilst we have obtained a pass for your Page, the person as I conceive most proper to be designed for the business) you must for three or four dayes before his supposed departure, dissemble some sickness that causes you to keep your bed, whereby the better to prevent all manner of pretended visits. After this, you may without suspicion, either apparel your self in the boyes habit, or provide others to the same likeness, (who however he be not handsome according to your excellent shape, yet he is of competent beauty and stature for our design) which being done, you may easily make an escape from this Castle, whilst he drest in your clothes keeps the Chamber, and so by consequence conveigh your self to what region you shall see most convenient; especially being warranted by a pass from the General Farezius , who will not deny such a courtesie it is to be supposed, after his late professions to Cratus the Ambassadour of Cyprus ; who may be the person employed to procure the writing, however he need not at all be made acquainted with the project, lest upon future examination he suffer thereby; which an Officer of his employment to a forreign State, would perhaps be unwilling to undergo, without some directions from his Masters that sent him; if you like my invention, I shall this night frame a Letter to Cratus , desiring him to move the General for a Pass, according to this purpose, that you may dispatch your little Messenger into Syria , to the Queen your Mother: Truly in my opinion, this project may easily be effected, if you have resolution enough to put it in execution; and at the worst, none can suffer but my self for either the escape or the miss; which being omitted, we are likely both to suffer a cruel death, or at the best a perpetual imprisonment; since it is not to be supposed you will quit your love to the Duke of Cyprus , to marry with some base Groom, according to the direction of the Senate. Cloria after she had with a dolefull look entertained this unwelcome motion; (which as she thought, was onely to be received as poyson to expell an infection, considering she was without Company, to undertake inconvenient and dangerous journeys over Seas, and through desert Countreys, scarce known unto her by report; and also to leave her Governess (alwayes the Counsellor of her youth) to be exposed to the fury of the Senate, when they should finde themselves deceived in their expectation) she could not chuse but send up to the Heavens, two or three deep sighs, fetcht as I may say, from the very bottom of her troubled spirit; which perturbation after a long silence, at last brought forth these words. And are you desirous now Roxana (said she) to quit the company of your poor Foster-childe, that for so many years you have directed, both in prosperous and adverse fortunes? Are you grown now weary of her company, that takes no felicity but in yours? Or is it rather, that you are not onely become careless of her preservation, but even weary of your own life, for that you seem desirous to expose us both to such eminent hazzards, as in a manner cannot be parallel'd? When she had uttered this superfluous and distracted discourse, that onely served as fuell to her grief, and trouble to Roxana's designs, she began with a little better temper, more seriously to reflect upon the pressing necessity of her affairs. In this consideration, in the first place she bethought her self of her own condition, not possible to be amended, without undertaking of hazzardable enterprizes: Next she began to entertain her minde with Idea's, of what a happiness she might enjoy by an escape, not onely in the future for being freed from all personal danger, but in possessing her self also of the company of her dear servant Narcissus , with all the rest of her friends and kindred: Last of all she conceived entirely, that it was much better to suffer her Governess, to remain still in the Castle behinde her, who as she imagined, could not receive much injury by reason of her age, notwithstanding what cruel dispositions soever, then daily for them both to be tormented, with new frights, if not more real sufferings, grounded upon jealousies and envy: Besides, that it was probable as she thought, the Senate would endeavour the marrying of her to some contemptible fortune, rather then suffer the alliance between her and the Duke of Cyprus to go forward, as Roxana had already intimated: So that at last (though with many tears standing in her sorrowful eyes, at the very apprehension of parting) she gave her sad consent, as I may say to this grievous determination; which however, she allowed her lips scarce time to utter, for haste to retire into her Chamber, leaving the whole mannagement of the plot to her Governesses will and discretion. This consent (though darkly pronounced) notwithstanding was liberty enough for Roxana , speedily to put in execution what she had determined; and to that purpose quickly framed a Letter to Cratus the Ambassadour in this sort.  My Lord Ambassadour of Cyprus , presuming upon our late discourse, wherein you informed me of some humane professions of the General, my Lady and Mistriss having a desire to dispatch some Messenger, to the Queen her Mother in Syria , she would gladly obtain a pass from his Authority, onely to conduct safely her little Page to that purpose; who else perhaps, might be interrupted in his passage either by Sea or Land: I hope this request will seem neither impudent, or impertinent to you or him; however, the obtaining of this small suit, shall oblige me in her name, to subscribe my self your most faithful Servant, Roxana.  Within two dayes she received the Pass according to her desire, which made her presently provide clothes and other things necessary for the Princess journey, whilst in the interim the better to delude the Guard of the Castle, she caused Cloria to feign her self sick, as it were with meer grief for her Fathers misfortunes, whereby she might not at all be importun'd by visits: she also used especial diligence in instructing the Page, concerning what part he was to play, for some time after the Princes was departed, both in keeping her bed and state; hoping by that means, the fallacy would not be perceived, until the Princess had freed her self from the Lydian jurisdiction, and so by consequence got safe either into Syria or Cyprus . When the time came for this unwilling flight, Cloria being accommodated after an artificial manner, though for a worser resemblance (however the boy notwithstanding, he wanted something of her stature, and much without any comparison of her excellent shape, had many tracts of beauty in his countenance, which within the curtains of her bed, could not easily be discerned being drest carefully in her night apparel, by which means it was to be hoped the Princess should not be discovered in her intended journey) with this disguise she was conducted by Roxana , about the shutting in of the evening, to a place near the Castle hill, where was provided a good horse for her transportation; who the better to liken her self to her Page, had covered her head also with false hair, such as he was accustomed to wear, when he attended upon her person; although she was not fitted at all with any of his garments, by reason of the decency of her sex and dignity, yet others were made of the same stuffe and fashion, the likelier to deceive all sorts of suspicious eyes, that in those unsettled times, used to enquire after all manner of persons and their business: Being there I say arrived, however sooner then she desired, though not before there was occasion for her departure; when she had abundantly washed her Governesses aged cheeks, with many Christal drops of her affectionate tears, which flowed without measure from her fair and sorrowful eyes, that appeared to be two Rocks of melting Diamonds, she at last broke from her embracements with a certain kinde of violence, as if a moderate parting had not been able to have made the last separation, without too much consideration of the misfortune: With these thoughts hastily she mounted her horse, there attending ready for her service, whilst the old woman all the while, had much ado to conceal the burning-flames of her own grief, that so cruelly raged in her troubled breast, for fear of giving her Mistriss any discouragement, in that bold conceived enterprize she had meerly undertaken by her perswasion. Having thus made two or three dayes journey with sufficient success; and that success having something assured her confidence, which confidence still increased her hopes, towards the Sea-side in Caria , where she intended to take shipping, at last she came to a great Forrest in the way, answerable to those directions she had received from her Governess in writing: but finding her self something weary, and conceiving the place secure enough from molestation, she quickly descended from her horse, and tying a long rein to his bridle, which she had brought with her to that purpose, she fastned him to a small shrub, with some liberty in that circumference to feed, whilst she laid her self down upon a grassie bank, to take also as she thought a repose: She had not remained in that innocent posture much above a quarter of an hours time, rather slumbering then sleeping, ere she was again wakened from that little rest, by a certain kinde of rustling she heard in the neighbouring bushes; and that noise gave her some occasion, rather to be fearful then curious, when of a sudden she might behold an aged (if not an old) person, clothed all in black, whose garment in a manner reached to the very ground, after the fashion of the strictest mourners in Lydia: his feeble steps was likewise as she might perceive, supported by a short staff he carried in one hand, as in the other he held a book, on which he seemed to read most attentively; however now and then, he cast up his eyes to Heaven, as it were by way of divine meditation. This unexpected object, gave the Princess some pleasing kinde of wonder, in regard of the imployment, that seemed inwardly to take so much possession of his soul, not onely for that the custom for the present, was something out of use in the Kingdom of Lydia , but that she hoped also to be instructed by his information, that might conduce to the better commodity of her journey; the rather, for that she knew not of any convenient entertainment, against the approaching nights darkness, the Sun being almost down: With these thoughts she arose from the place where she rested; yet she had not made many paces towards him, but he belike hearing her steps amongst the leaves, cast up his looks from the book, which before had kept him (as I said) most attentively imployed; when perceiving a youth of comely proportion and courtly attire, coming towards him, he not onely quickly clapt too the covering, but with a civility that seemed to challenge something of City breeding, he hasted to encounter the Princess: she perceiving his intention by the same rules of courtesie, endeavoured the meeting with what convenient speed she could. The desires of them both, having brought them to a most near distance, Cloria might easily discern that the old man in his contemplation had been weeping, and shed many tears; wherefore with something a chearful countenance, she saluted him with this language. Father ( said she ) I hope your perfect charity (which I judge to be so by your present exercise) will easily pardon a strangers interruption, that desires onely your assistance, as well to put him again in the right way, as to be informed of the next place for entertainment, since the nights neighbourhood, threatens a certain inconvenience to my travels, towards the Sea-side in Caria , where my intention is to take shipping for the Island of Cyprus , being of that Countrey; especially in that I dare not overmuch confide in the information I have by writing without some other more particular direction. Truly replyed the old man, as perchance it will be my good fortune to afford you the service both wayes; perhaps you may do me also a pleasure of no ordinary nature in that Countrey. To this purpose then, I shall in the first place tell you, all the Ports in the Province of Caria are stopt, in regard of some differences that are lately fallen out between our people and other Nations concerning Trade; so that your best course for the more certain accomplishing of your intention, will be, (according to my opinion) to prosecute your journey, yet farther towards Deorcas , upon the Confines of Pamphylia , which is a good Haven Town, newly taken from the jurisdiction of Egypt by the Syrians ; where you may obtain what benefit of passage you please, to any part of the world: and for your accommodation, you shall not need to trouble your thoughts with the care of this nights lodging; since I must hold it a favour to me, rather then an obligation from you, that you will be pleased to make use of my own little habitation within the compass of these Woods: as in these two particulars I have fulfilled your desire, so must I take the boldness to make you also acquainted with my request. After that Cloria had thanked him for his courtesie, and promised to be a faithful servant in any thing within her power, the old Father told her in short, that the kindness he intended to demand, was onely to convey the small book he carried in his hand into Cyprus , written by Euarchus , being a dying Legacy, left to his Children by the King at his death, which was a story he made no doubt, but he had heard of; and the convenience himself had not, both by reason of his age and other impediments: Upon this Cloria askt him his name; whereupon he answered he was called Hephestion . In times past (said he) an unworthy Flamin intrusted by Euarchus , though now a banished person into deserts, perhaps for his over much fidelity to his Prince; at these words Cloria had much ado to abstain from weeping: but considering the unproperness of the season, and being invited by the Flamin towards his little habitation, for the better accommodation to either, she was at the present something diverted from her sorrowful resolutions: They went all the way together conferring about particular actions, belonging to the Kingdom of Lydia , amongst which number, Euarchus's death had no small remembrance, notwithstanding the Princess all she could, endeavoured to put off the occasion, whereby her journey should not be overmuch mixed with sad considerations: As soon as they entered into his house, not many furlongs from the place where they first met, Cloria perceived a Picture drawn to the life, wherein was represented her Father and Mother in a beautiful Garden, holding a Garland of Flowers between them, with many young Cupids playing about a Fountain; whilst in the interim their Royal Crowns lay at their feet upon two Velvet Cushions. This sight however against her will, made her again reflect upon her Parents prosperity, which brought her at last so far to consider the uncertainty of this inferiour world, that she almost put on a resolution to leave her journey, with the dear love to her Lord Narcissus , and in her disguise remain still in the Forrest with the old Flamin , onely to exercise such rules of Devotion, as he should from time to time prescribe her. Long she had not continued in this extasie of contemplation, before he shewed her also her own Picture, that hung in another part of the room: After which, he read such a lecture of commendation upon the subject, that Cloria could not chuse but a little delight her self, in apprehending how much the old Flamin was mistaken, not thinking she was so near him, whom at present he highly praised; however the poor Princess, could not glory much in her own fortunes, since the remembrance of her Fathers death, took from her desires, in a manner all felicity whatsoever: She began also to dispute with him concerning her condition, and when he last saw her; whereupon he told her, that as at this time, she remained under the Senates jurisdiction, confined to a strong Castle formerly belonging to the King, so had she in her life run through multitudes of admirable adventures, both in the Kingdom of Lydia and elsewhere: From this discourse Hephestion fell again violently upon the Kings vertues, with the constant courage he shewed at his death, notwithstanding all the scornful attempts were used, to bring down his spirit, whereby to make him so far descend in his thoughts, as contemptibly to yield, and comply with popular pride: Then he let her know, that his last words were directed to his Son Prince Arethusius , whom he wish'd rather to endeavour the regaining of his own Kingdoms, then the revenging of his Fathers injuries: From one discourse to another, they past away the time, until they were called into the Parlor to supper, which was attended onely by a Priest of a neighbouring Temple, whose service as it should seem; the Flamin made use of upon all necessary occasions: Within an hours space after their meal, Hephestion brought Cloria into her Chamber, where instead of much sleep, she fell upon many considerations concerning her own passage: and whether or no, it were best to follow her former directions, in attempting to take shipping at some Haven Town in the Province of Caria? or else to rule her self in her journey, by the advice of the old Father, whom she imagined could not be mistaken in his information, of all the Ports of the Kingdom being stopt, which as she thought, might prove of a most dangerous consequence to her person, in regard she could not chuse at the best, but be most strictly examined in her passage, notwithstanding her warrant from the General; where being discovered, she was sure either to suffer death, or a perpetual and most sharp imprisonment: Of the contrary taking her course towards the City of Deorcas in Pamphylia , she might with industry by obscure passages, free her self from the interruption of the Souldiers of all the Garrisons; especially, resolving to avoid the Towns lying upon the Confines of each Countrey, which in her passage by Sea out of Caria , she could not possibly do, in regard that upon her very imbarking particular notice would be taken both of her and others in the company; and so by consequence her name and pretentions were to be inrolled according to the custom in such cases used: As these reasons made her fully resolve to steer her course towards Deorcas , where she supposed her arrival would put her into an absolute security, since the Town was become under the jurisdiction of the Syrians , gained from the Egyptians by a late stratagem of War: so having spent the night between sleep and consideration, in the morning early, with many thankful complements, she parted from the house of the old Flamin , well satisfied in her minde; not onely for that she had received the best directions, to comfort up her hopes in her journey, but that she was also the possessor of her Fathers book, which she could never obtain during her long imprisonment, notwithstanding she had heard much of the contents thereof; being hindred from that conceived happiness by the vigilant guard, that continually attended about her person, with over careful, if not too spightful eyes. The Princess having made many dayes journey, after she parted from the Flamins house, through a Countrey that began something to taste of devastation, by reason of the late Wars between the King and the Senate, at last arrived upon the Confines of Lydia and Pamphylia , where she took up her lodging in a small cottage, not far from the high way side; in regard she durst not well venture her person, in any Town of remark, notwithstanding the Pass she had from the General: but being entered, she found onely an old man and an aged woman sitting by the fire; for that the time of the year at present, seemed to pretend rather to frost and snow, then to open and fair weather. Cloria had scarce saluted them with a few courteous speeches, with an excuse for her bold intrusion, considering she claimed as she said, no interest in their habitation; but by way of return they let her know, supposing her to be a youth according to her disguise, that as they were, not accustomed since the distractions of the times, that gave not property scarce to any in their own dwellings, to meet with such civil visits; so should both himself and his necessities be heartily welcome to what commodity that poor place would afford. The Princess being extreamly taken with the good nature of the people, besides the gentleness of her own disposition, returned them many thanks for their kindness, and withal assured them, they should be well payed as well for their provision as their courtesie: whereupon the old man desired her to sit down, saying, that as soon as his Son came from the Market, he should also take care for her horse: It was not long before he enquired from whence she came, and what might be her business in these parts, being as he said in appearance, a youth of such beauty, and excellent behaviour. Cloria as these words could not chase but smile, apprehending with some content, how much her disguise, accompanied by that confidence, she had rather procured out of necessity in travels, then enjoyed any way by nature, seemed to deceive the world; she told him at last, that as she could not pretend to those attributes he bestowed upon her condition, so of the other side, she had no other account to give of her affairs, but that she was a young person, that onely intended for the present a voyage into the Island of Cyprus , when by chance having made her passage through the Kingdom of Lydia , it was her fortune being weary to take up an Inne in that house: Scarce had she delivered thus much, but the Springal his Son, entered the room, whistling for want of better education; he wore also his Cap of one side, as if he had been sole Master of the Farm; or at leastwise born the chief prerogative therein, by the too much indulgency of his Parents; for he began already with commanding words to ask for victuals: but suddenly espying the new come stranger, he seemed to startle a little back, as if it had been some object of wonder, that deserved both respect and consideration. At last he gave the Princess a kinde of a slight salute, as it might be seen, still retaining in his nature an intention of pride, though he appeared willing to be rudely civil, as a decorum belonging to his profession, according to the good opinion he had of his own person. Cloria finding that they all began to put on in their countenance a certain affected silence, after the young Boors arrival, she told the old man, that if they thought her presence any impediment, either to their affairs or communication, she was content if no other lodging could be found, to lie without doors; or if they pleased, take the same conveniency they were willing to afford her horse in some of the outbuildings: but they presently all cryed out, that both her self and her horse, should not want any commodity their habitation would allow, though in several kindes: with these words the old people desired their Son for his own credit, as well as theirs, he would go and take a special care of the Gentlemans Steed, whilst they themselves provided something necessary for all their suppers. In conclusion, having spent two hours time in eating, and other pretty discourses concerning the passages of the age, wherein Euarchus memory had the largest proportion, poor Cloria sufficiently weary by reason of her tedious travel, began a little to close her fair eyes in the sight of the company; and this gave them occasion quickly to put her in minde of her lodging, wherein they appointed their Son to be her Bed-fellow: But O ye Gods, with what inward blushes did the sweet Princess at the first apprehension entertain the motion, though at last she fell upon this witty invention, whereby to prevent without any distaste, the determination; which in truth served as well for a complement, as for avoidance: She told them, as she was not so ill bred after all her kinde entertainment, as to inconvenient any of them in their ordinary rest, so had she made a certain promise (if not a vow) to her self, that oftentimes she would lie in no bed within the compass of her travels, wherefore if they pleased onely to accommodate her, with a little fresh straw instead of the other courtesie, she should esteem it favour enough in her thoughts. Notwithstanding this, the young clown would needs have Cloria for the greater complement, to be provided in his own Chamber; for that as he said, it was both warmer and freer from smoke, then the room where they remained. This bargain being at last agreed upon of all sides, the Princess being loath to give any cause of jealousie or suspicion, knowing her self to be near a Garrison Town belonging to the Senate, she was conducted with some little ceremony to her lodging, which in truth she was the willinger to accept, in regard she might hope to get some necessary information from the youngsters discourse, concerning her better passage. The Princess I say being accommodated after this homely manner, suddenly cast her self down upon the straw, with as seeming a content; as if she had been in some magnificent Palace of Asia , and so by consequence settled both her body and thoughts, to a convenient rest towards her farther journey: but the lusty Farmer belike being accustomed to use many circumstances before he went to bed; began not onely to sing and whistle, as he was unapparelling of himself, but interrupted her intenions by many impertinent questions, until his rude kinde of unclothing his person for very shame, caused the fair Cloria , to hide her head as well as she could within the straw; and so continued not onely whilst he was entirely gotten into his pallet, but had also put out the candle. This obscurity gave Cloria a new confidence, and the confidence opened her ears again to his discourses, though in her thoughts she had reserved all communications for the next morning: He asked her whether or no she was so drowsie, that she could not afford him two or three words of prattle before she slept? As the Princess found it was almost impossible, to divert him at present from his intention, so did she resolve to make a vertue of necessity, hoping since it would no otherwise be, that she might at leastwise procure some information to her self by the interruption: In conclusion at last he told her, that he had many things to say of a secret nature, if he were assured her wisdom were answerable to that opinion he had of her person. The Princess at these words began to be a little inflamed, with the desire of the knowledge of what he meant, and therefore promised fidelity in what he should commit to her trust and discretion. The Boor belike not being of any constitution, to harbour concealed thoughts long in his bosom; or having a greater confidence in the strangers ingenuity, then perhaps other people would have had upon the score of so small acquaintance, freely confest unto her, that he and other clowns of the neighbourhood, had resolved that day in the Market (himself having promised to be their Captain) to perform some notable exploit shortly, both in revenge of the Kings death, and the vindication of their own liberties. As Cloria esteemed this enough for her knowledge, so would she for the present, press him to no other particulars; the rather, for that he bid her now go sleep, though in the morning he assured her she should know more. But scarce had her gentle and weary eyes, entertained a convenient sleep after her dayes tedious travel, but that she was suddenly wakened from that necessary rest, by a great appearing tumult about the Cottage, which soon satisfied her fearful expectation, by the coming into the Chamber of four or five Souldiers of the next Garrison, who going to the bed-side of the youngster, commanded him presently to rise, and go along with them to the Governour, in regard as they said, he had wounded with some other of his companions, two or three of the Guard the day before in the Market. This accident seemed to put Cloria in some danger, however at last putting on a better resolution then ordinary, since it was unpossible for her to conceal her being there, in regard her outward Garment lay upon the Table; onely clothed as she was, rose out of the straw, and being confident of her Pass she had procured from the General, having also hid the Book she had of the Flamin in the bed, that infallibly else would have betrayed her, she with some boldness and assurance, demanded what they meant, to disturb a passenger in his rest, that was imployed by Farezius their chief Captain in necessary affairs belonging to the State, which the writing she carried in her hand (as she said) gave her warrant without interruption to prosecute. First they beheld her for a pretty space, then read the paper very attentively: and last of all told her, that as they had no intention at all to disturb her occasions, much less to disobey any directions from their noble and valiant General; so were they commanded by their Governour, to apprehend that insolent young Boor, who in his drink, had not onely spoken some words against the Senate, in defence of the late King, but also had wounded some of their fellow Souldiers in his rage: Cloria thought it not good by way of complement, to dispute any thing in the Boors behalf; insomuch, as she wisht them to do their pleasure, according to their Commission, lest her self might have been discovered in the contention, she resolved also before day in that City hurly-burly, (taking advantage of the conveniency granted her) to pass by the next Town, out of the Confines of Lydia ; which she happily by this means effected, without any adventure of a remarkable nature; and so by consequence within a few dayes journey, arrived at the Haven Town in the Countrey of Pamphylia , under the jurisdiction of the Syrian Monarchy. The Princess in this manner being come safely (as I say) to the City of Deorcas , she began presently to enter into consideration, whether or no she should discover her person, since she supposed she was now secure within the Dominions and Command of Orontes King of Syria? many reasons she disputed within her self both wayes: Of one side she conceived it would be something preposterous, for her to appear before the Queen her Mother, in the likeness of her Page, when she had conveniency enough, without danger to change her apparel; so on the other side did she imagine, it might prove too great a trouble and charge to the inhabitants, not onely to entertain her, but to conduct her to the Syrian Court, in the nature and quality of a Princess: notwithstanding she put off the absolute determination thereof for some few dayes; intending in the interim, to visit in her disguise, those places of remark worthy the seeing, within the compass both of the Town and Haven. But whilst she spent her time in this sort, without any certain resolution; contrary to the thoughts of the Governour and Garrison, the City was suddenly and strongly besieged, by a mighty Army of the Egyptians , and the rest of the neighbouring people of the Countrey of Pamphylia: This accident (or rather might it be called a design) gave Cloria's thoughts some trouble, in regard she intended to have passed by Land into the Kingdom of Syria ; which determination became absolutely obstructed by this means: yet that which discomposed most the poor Princess was, a new intelligence that came into the Town, how that the Egyptians had made a late combination with the Senate of Lydia , by a considerable number of Ships to block up the Haven by Sea, as their Forces had all the passages by Land: Cloria finding her affairs in this strait, became more then ordinary afflicted in her minde, since she seemed to be in the condition of those persons, that appeared to be something near many felicities, and yet could not arrive to the enjoying of any one; however, after some short time of consideration, having entertained in her minde in the interim, many fancies concerning her escape, at last she resolved to try, notwithstanding any threatning danger, whether or no some small Barks lying in the Haven, would undertake for a good summe of money, to transport her either into Syria or Cyprus: Although she quickly attempted this design, yet she found none would venture upon the business; not onely for that they were unwilling to experiment the hazzard, knowing how many Ships of all sorts, lay continually scattered upon the Seas, of the enemy, but also in regard the Governour of the Town, had absolutely forbid all Vessels to depart without a special licence from himself or the State: Nevertheless as the sweet Princess had remained many dayes something desperate in her thoughts, one afternoon of a sudden, she heard a great noise and acclamation in the Haven, and not long after was informed by the people of the house, that a competent number of Ships were newly entered the Town, with all manner of provisions necessary for the siege, sent to that effect, by the provident care of Candalus the Syrian Admiral: However she knew not how to make any advantage to her own particular, concerning this esteemed good fortune to the City, notwithstanding she resolved with the rest of the company, to rejoyce at the accident; and to that purpose in the crowd, went down to the Haven where the Vessels lay, both to congratulate and be a spectator, of what was esteemed to be so luckily an omen by all the inhabitants; though rather they might have judged it a special providence of the Syrian Officer: within a day or two, it was determined by a Councel of Warre, as well of Sea Captaines as Land Commanders, that notwithstanding the provisions that had been sent, were held competent to continue the City a long time in a defensive posture, yet was it resolved also, the Ships should again return, and carry with them as many unserviceable inhabitants, as could be spared from the Towns defence, the better to provide the remaining party, of such necessaries as were fit to hold out a long siege; and this the rather, in regard they expected in a manner hourly to be blockt up upon the water, by the assistance of the Lydian Fleet, according to the former intelligence the Town had received, of the late league made between the Egyptians and the Senate: Cloria was not a little transported with this news, since by the means she doubted not within a short time in that company, but to be landed according to her desire, in some Haven belonging to the Syrian Monarchy. Within a short space, all the inhabitants necessary to quit the strong City of Deorcas , were imbarked in those Vessels of Syria , either for Tyre , or some other convenient place upon the continent, in which number the fair Princess (as I said) would by no means stay behinde. Yet as they were upon the Seas, having scarce sailed six hours, but they perceived half a score Ships at some distance, to make up towards them, however they could not perceive by any means, what colours they bore upon their tops, notwithstanding they apprehended enough danger to their voyage; neither might they possible again get into the Haven, by reason of the contrary windes: About an hour after this discovery, they too well perceived, they were a brave squadron of Ships belonging to the Lydian jurisdiction, as they approached still nearer and nearer to them with a strong gust. Upon this the Admiral, with the rest of the Officers entered into consultation, what was to be done if they should be in any kinde attempted? It was resolved after a sharp dispute, that however they determined to make some shew to the company, as if they meant to fight, yet they concluded, if they were attempted, rather to yield, then hazzard the Syrian Vessels in so unequal a contestation; especially when they doubted not at the worst, but to be fetcht off by some treaty, since the two Nations yet held a kinde of a correspondency one with another. In the interim nevertheless, they gave private order to one of their swiftest Vessels, to put up Egyptian Colours upon her Mast, and in that posture to haste to the Town of Salamny in Cyprus , whereby to inform that State of their condition, if there should be any need of their assistance: Scarce had they time to put in execution these orders, but the Admiral of the Lydian Fleet, sent out in the long Boat from his own Ship, a peremptory messenger, not onely to receive information from whence they came, and who they carried in their Ships, but commanded them without farther expostulation, to do homage to the Commonwealth of Lydia , by admitting a particular search of their burthens, that they carried no persons of any suspicious nature, contrary to that dominion or jurisdiction, which they claimed upon the Seas. The Princess Cloria thinking it full time now to discover her self, (not onely in regard that all the company feared, they were presently to be delivered up prisoners to the Lydian power; but also, for that she had cast away her Pass, that might have freed her person at the worst) presently came to the Syrian Admiral, and told him who she was. As the Sea Commander was exceedingly startled at this unexpected discovery, and by consequence put to some distraction, so at last he resolved, rather to hazzard his Masters Ships in a fight, then basely to deliver the Princess Cloria up into the hands of her conceived enemies. In prosecution of this new resolution, the Admiral returned this answer; that as he did not know by what Laws, much less any authority derived from the Senate of Lydia , the Officer of the Ships, could justly interrupt the free passage of the Seas; so he wisht the messenger to let his Master know, that himself was a Commander to mighty Orontes great King of Syria , from whom no power, was able to exact the least obedience either by Sea or Land. This return quickly heated their disputes of both side, especially by other Messengers sent from either Fleet; and the disputes at last warmed their bloods, which soon inflamed their choller: Insomuch, as within a half hours space, from words they went to blows; first flinging their darts over the hatches at a distance, then fell in a confused way to grapple one with another, until some Vessels of each side were fired and sunk, though the Syrians appeared to have much the worse of the fight. As this gave occasion, both to the unfortunate Princess, and the rest of the distressed company within the Syrian Fleet, not onely passionately to call to the Gods for their best assistance, so many of those that felt already the scorching flames near them, cryed out with all the violence that could be, rather to yield presently to the enemies mercy, then to undergo any farther hazzard, onely upon points of ceremony and priviledge on the Seas: Others again being busie in the contention, neither felt wounds, or apprehended danger, and therefore continued still passionately their endeavours, both to fight and destroy: At last by fortune, the two Admirals meeting together, there began a new and most sharp encounter, not onely by reason the Princess Cloria was discovered to the chief Commander, to be in his ship, but for that there were in her also many revolted Marriners, that formerly had belonged to the Jurisdiction of the Senate of Lydia , which rendred them altogether desperate in their expectation, if they should either yield or be taken prisoners; wherefore they resolved to fight it out to the last-man: But on the other side, the Lydian Fleet being a great deal better provided, with all materials and provisions of War; as also their Vessels being of a far braver making, the advantage seemed to be eminent, if not desperate against the Syrians , which caused at the present in many of them, some considerations of a parley; however whilst they prepared themselves to set up a Flag of Truce, and were sending Messengers to that purpose, of a sudden the Lydian Admiral boarded the Ship where Cloria was: the resistance that was made, had not power sufficient to repell the force and courage of the enemy, though many sacrificed their lives to prevent the mischief; wherefore the Princess finding her own condition to be in a manner desperate, began to complain exceedingly in her thoughts, that she had foolishly cast away her pass, that might now have done her most principal service: Yet she resolved as her onely refuge and defence, with a certain kinde of bold confidence, to make use of her disguize, whereby to deny her quality; the rather did she presume upon these hopes, for that she had not revealed her self to any, but to the chief Admiral, who had promised her with the hazzard of his life, to be most secret in that knowledge: With these determinations she expected in her Cabin, the final issue of the fight, until at last the ship being wholly overcome, by the slaughter of most of the company, a Lydian Commander suddenly entered the Room where she was: Where presently finding her Fathers Book about her, which her distractions had not sufficiently provided for, he delivered her to safe custody, whilst he should have more conveniency to examine her farther. As soon as the Captain had disposed of all the prisoners, and settled the other affairs of the Ship, he undertook anew to interrogate Cloria , both of her condition and business: He demanded likewise, why she had that Book in her possession, which as he said, had been forbid by a publick decree of the Senate of Lydia: Although the courageous Princess, with a constant resolution for a long season, disputed with the Officer about the Kings writings, pretending she was a stranger belonging to the Countrey of Syria , and in her Travels had met with it by chance; yet the Admiral, who had perfectly known her favour, when she was conducted from Pergame out of Creet , into the Kingdom of Lydia , reflecting at the present in his fancy, upon the same seeming countenance, her Perrewig being pulled off, by a few more questions added to the suspition; which belike the Princess could not very well answer, she was at last discovered, with no less joy to the company, then grief to her self: Upon this absolute knowledge, she was conducted with a kinde of a Triumph, into the Lydian Admirals own ship, whilst the fight should be totally finished; where she remained as it may be thought afflicted enough, until the night parted the fray; which in a manner gave an entire victory to the Lydians , either by sinking their enemies Ship, or putting most of them to flight. Scarce had the Sun the next morning notwithstanding, saluted the Seas above the Horizon, with more glorious beams then accustomed, the whole Fleet endeavouring to draw up their Anchors, to haste their Vessels to the Ionian and Carian shore, with their rich booty; as they were at their work, they became advertised by a Boy upon one of the masts, that within the reach of his eye, might be discerned a great Fleet; which as far as he could distinguish, sailed towards theirs. This intelligence gave the Admiral some trouble, in regard he knew those Ships could not possibly belong to their party; since his own number was the full proportion, the Senate for the present were well able to set out, insomuch, as commanding the youth to descend from his station, he himself quickly mounted into his place, to be the better assured both of their colours and strength! Where being arrived, his thoughts were soon satisfied, that they were suddenly to enter into a new fight; for by the Flags that bore the Arms of Narcissus , Duke of Cyprus (who was wholly addicted to the Syrian interest) they had no hope to be confident of their friendship. The Captain having communicated to his Councel, the quantity and quality of those Ships he had seen; after they had consulted a while, both himself and the chief Officers, came to fortifie the courages of the Marriners and common Souldiers, against the approaching encounter. This gave sufficient employment to the whole company, not onely in disposing those prisoners, they had formerly in several holds under the decks, (however the Princess Cloria was still detained in the Admirals Cabin) but also to order every thing in the Ships, to the best advantage: Some armed themselves in the surest manner they could, others thought a lighter way of defence would be more proper to fight, with the better conveniency and liberty. A third sort of people, brought darts and other weapons to their fellows, with materials to stop breaches; in conclusion none was idle or wanted industry, which continued them all in action, untill the whole Fleet approached: Nevertheless, they made a stand, and presently sent a Messenger, who came as he said to know, why contrary to common Right and the Law of Nations, they had not onely set upon, but destroyed the Syrian Vessels, without any offence, going into their own Countrey. The Admiral of Lydia quickly made this reply , That as they came upon the Seas to help their friends and neighbours the Egyptians, (over which they claimed a speciall Prerogative) so had the Syrians in their Ships, the person of the Princess Cloria, King Euarchus's Daughter; who more rightly belonged to the Senate of Lydia, then any other. No sooner was this Message returned, but the sky began to be suddenly darkened with multitudes of Darts and Arrows; after which artificial fire flew in the air, as if the Souldiers by that light onely intended to fight: for many hours the encounter seemed equal, in regard they yet kept at some distance; for one while the Lydian Fleet chased part of those Vessels of Cyprus , otherwhiles those of Cyprus appeared to have the better; now and then Ships of either side from the main body, would grapple one with another: which as I may say kept them continually fighting, though neither as yet seemed beaten or overcome, though those of Cyprus appeared to have something the better of the encounter, till about an hour before night; when many Vessels from the Confines of Pamphylia , suddenly struck in to the assistance of the Lydians . This gave occasion to those of Cyprus a little to retire, as it should seem to make use of the approaching darkness of the season, (finding themselves likely to be over numbred) whilst in the interim both Fleets at some distance ankored, during the coverture of the firmament, one by another. The Admirall of the Island of Cyprus (they being as I said, not far off that shore) dispatched presently another small Bark to the City of Salamnie , where the Duke then continued his Court since the reducement of the Town, not onely to desire speedy supplies before morning, when again they intended to renew the Fight, but also to let him know, that the Princess Cloria remained a prisoner amongst the Lydian Ships, whose redemption as he conceived would be a sufficient prize for the victors. O you Gods, with what a transported fury did Narcissus entertain this unexpected news? In a certain kinde of rage he commanded the Ships in the Haven presently to be made ready: Then he gave order to have not onely all the Garrison Souldiers of the Town to be mustered, but every Burger and Inhabitant able to beat Arms, to prepare their best endeavours, whereby to redeem as he said, his dear Cloria from her captivity, as if he imagined they should walk upon the waters to do her service: When he had endeavoured what he could to set out Vessels to Sea, there being at that instant but a very few in the Harbour, in regard the Merchants of the City had lately sent out a great Fleet, and their Convoy was already in fight with the enemy, he lanched himself in person, with about a douzen gallant Ships: Before noon he could not by reason of contrary windes, reach the sight of the two Fleets, who all the morning had been in another cruel and desperate engagement; however with his Sword drawn in his hand, he threatned the toyling Marriners to make haste to the rescue of his Love; though they were to ask leave both of Neptune and Eolus for their speed: All the way they sailed, in a manner the waves seemed to be mingled with blood, and the face of the water to be covered with dead bodies: In this horrid conflict notwithstanding, the people of Cyprus appeared to have the worst, and their whole Fleet was in danger to be overthrown. But as these supplies being perceived, gave many of their torn Vessels new courage, so the Marriners and Souldiers, presently with loud cries, began not onely again to fall upon their enemies, but performed many actions of a remarkable nature. Narcissus having enquired of some prisoners, in what part of the Fleet the Princess Cloria remained, being advertized she was in the Admirals own Ship, it was not such a violence he used as was accustomed to accompany his former victories, but a fury that might have reacht the Conquest of the world, that drove on his hopes to her redemption. In conclusion, having for many hours sought out the Admiral, at last he met him a little distant from his other Ships. The fight then I may say, began to be renewed, if not rather doubled with advantage, since their Guards of either side strived both for their honours and safeties; neither was it long before they approached at such a distance, that the Souldiers had conveniency with their Iron Hooks, to catch hold of each others Vessel: As these kept them together they fought of either side upon the Hatches, with blood and slaughter enough, as it may be thought: But as it should seem Narcissus impatient of all manner of delay, and perceiving the Lydian Admiral, performed actions rather of wonder, then of ordinary courage, attempted with violence to enter his ship: Twice he was hindred, if not repulsed by the chief Captain himself, which made those Souldiers about him to press on with so much fury, that the Admiral being at last slain, they presently boarded the Vessel. Narcissus as soon as he was in possession of the ship, he instantly sought out the Princess Cloria . As the joyful meeting of those two Lovers, cannot be exprest but in the imagination onely; so would not the time then admit of much discourse, since the victory as yet was disputing with most extraordinary violence; and certainly would have fallen heavy upon one party or other, by some desperate and ruinating fate, if the more merciful night had not prevented the intention, that at last separated the two gallant Fleets, contrary to their desires, to begin a new encounter in the morning; but the windes rising in the interim, at break of day they found themselves so far distant one from another, that brave Narcissus was perswaded to think it Conquest enough, to have brought home to his own Countrey, his lovely Mistress, after all her dangerous and severall adventures, where also after her joyful arrivall, she met with another happiness contrary to her expectation; which was the safety and freedom of Roxana , with her Dwarf, whose strange deliverance (however) my pen at the present is too weary to relate; onely I must offer the Reader, this Sacrifice from Creses to the Princess Cloria .  Sweet Beauty of my Soul judge it no crime To love you still, yet as a thing divine; For bravest Diamonds here sometimes are seen, Foiled with vulgar stones of no esteem. Alwayes the Sun casts not his brightest Beams On Mountain tops, but oft on humble streams: The smallest Worms may feed in richest ground; And wealthy Mines in barren earth are found: Though Thrones are made for Kings, yet pleas'd they'l be With Subjects hearts, as well as Majesty. All which I hope may for example serve, To make you think, some grace I do deserve; Since you I covet not, onely I sing, My own content, and your eternal spring. With these thoughts and expressions, I say, poor Creses waited upon Cloria , when she went to the Temple to be married to Narcissus . Of the Princess CLORIA. Narcissus , were performed with no great solemnity, by reason of the sad remembrance of Euarchus death, that in a manner took up peoples thoughts and considerations, both with wonder and amazement; All the Temples were rather furnished with Ornaments of Funerals, then those chearful decorums, that usually accompany Nuptials; onely the Altars had Tapers of white Wax lighted on them, where the Priests performed their Offices, in a kinde of a melancholly posture: 'Tis true, the beautifull Bride could not well obscure her own Lustre, since nature seemed to disdain any coverture of her perfections, though invited thereunto by Lydia's disasters: Nevertheless the Roses of her cheeks, appeared to have gotten the mastery over that excellent opposite colouring in her face, as it were by a predominate power of modesty, whilst her fair hand did bashfully but execute, what her heart had long ago consented unto, however now cowardly it seemed a little to retreat from the bargain: In a word, the multitude almost mistook the Deity, and adored Cloria more then prayed to Hymen . But after that two or three dayes time, had put an end to these seeming superfluities, that rather created fancies of delight, then gave fruition to the Lovers desires, since the best content is to converse freely in love, without being too much circumscribed by Ceremoniall Rules; both of them with their Royal Brother Prince Arethusius were perswaded, to take their recreation in a Forrest belonging to the Castle, where they then remained near the City of Paphos ; as well to put from their thoughts, those sad remembrances of the Kings death, as also a little to digest the other excesses occasioned by reason of the feastival time; this resolution of the youthful and noble company gave in like manner, a conveniency to Creses and Roxana , to meet in the shades of a certain wood more near the House: Though this encounter was accidental, yet both of them had watched the like occasion, for the better discovery of their thoughts one to another, which conveniently as it should seem, was not to be compassed, as long as any Triumphs lasted, appertainining to the Marriage, since as Roxana could not be spared from the attendance of her Lady and Mistress, so was Creses tyed in some sort to the continual observance of Prince Arethusius services: The place that gave them entertainment, appeared plentifully furnished almost with all the delights, that nature could bestow upon it; for the Trees were so evenly ordered to please the eye, that they seemed to call the judgement, as the best witness of the Geometrical decorum of the whole: Neither had the windes any power to offend them walking, as the Sun by his sharpest beams to penitrate those pleasant Cabinets, which the leaved boughs had prettily contriv'd in many places for shelter: In the midst of the Grove there was a small plat of ground, something elevated above the rest, incompassed with tall Cypres Trees, that pretended to guard a stately Monument, belonging to the memory of the Duke of the Island, who had first opposed the jurisdiction of the Kings of Egypt in the Countrey; which Trophy, as it should seem, the people had raised to his honour: By the side thereof near a small running Brook, Roxana and Creses seated themselves, whilst the old woman was perswaded, to begin a relation of her own adventures, concerning her escape out of Lydia , since the manner thereof Creses had not yet understood, though the particulars of the Princes Cloria's own deliverance, had been amply made known to the whole Court by her self; wherefore after some cirumstances used, she made recital of this following story. As it will be necessary, said Roxana , to introduce the death of Euarchus the King in my discourse, being the chief original of all those passages, so cannot I but believe, a thousand tongues will scarce be sufficient, to express the lamentation due to that unparallel'd slaughter: But the immortal Gods are onely to be obeyed, and not to be questioned in the disposure of humane things, with which thoughts I shall proceed: No sooner was the news, said she, brought to Euarchus of his approaching death, (though Cratus the Ambassadour of Cyprus had in the interim endeavoured with money, threats, and prayers, to divert or suspend the execution of the sentence) but the King, whether or no not believing the Message, or rather out of the greatness of his spirit, would not seem to be apprehensive of Mortality, that generally belonged to mankinde, with a smile at the first onely appeared to deride the advertisement; until the Officer assuring him, that what he delivered was not alone true, but also unrevocable; the King presently let him know, that as he was determined to obey the Gods decrees, notwithstanding they were to be executed by the meanest of the people, so could he have wished that his ungratefull Subjects, had been endued with less power from the Heavens, or he with more authority to have resisted their actions; since he feared thereby would determine Lydia's felicity; with these words he retired into his Chamber, as conceiving it more necessary for the recollection of his thoughts, then any farther to expostulate with a person, that perhaps had neither ability or will, to give him satisfaction in any of his discourses: I shall not need to trouble you, said she, with many particulars concerning these passages; onely let it suffice you know, that the place designed for this tragedy, was at the gate of his chief Palace in Sardis , where the rude multitude assembled in great numbers, to behold what their amazements could scarce distinguish or apprehend, since as the souldiers of one side were there ranged, to keep both their thoughts and actions in quiet, so were their own fears and distractions of sufficient force, to hinder them from all mutinies and publick complaints: In this posture I say about the ninth hour in the morning was Euarchus prepared for his execution, whilst the world seemed (in the mindes of men) to be near falling with his fate, the Sun not giving that light as was accustomed: To his dismal Throne of Death he went, as if rather he thought upon his usual Exercises, than of his extirpation for ever, taking his leave of the people, (however with such a winning Majesty) as if he still esteemed himself both their King and friend, though his misfortunes had lessened his power, to act what he would both for his own and their advantages: The fatal blow being given at last by an unknown if not ugly Executioner, some few of the Kings friends (since many of them wanted courages, to appear active in dangers of this hazzardable nature) between money and other perswasions amongst the Souldiers, obtained the body after the slaughter, to be committed to the Funeral Piles, which however they performed with no ceremonies: Not many dayes from this doleful solemnity; or rather may I call it necessary Rites, the Senate triumphing and glorying in their purchase, whilst yet the amazed people were distracted in their imaginations between fear and expectation, caused a general Proclamation to be made, throughout all the chief Streets of Sardis , that none should presume, either to name another King to succeed, or to talk of any other Government, then what themselves were to institute. And in the interim, decreed most of the Royal party to be disinherited, for the former fidelity they had shewed to their Prince; wherein such cruelties were used by their Ministers, that neither story could example, or pardons could protect; since as for the most part, they broke their own contracts and promises, so did they put in execution those rigours, rather by their wills and suspitions, they by the proof and testimony of mens actions and supposed crimes: This also ushered in as I may say, the condemnation three eminent persons, to wait upon their Royal Master: Arranus the General of the Myssian Army; Leonides the gallant Commander of the Forces within the City of Cleosa ; and one Paridenus sometime a Courtier, whose story I must particularly mention, before I come to the relation of my own adventures; for that perhaps the passages may afford some delight to your thoughts, to sweeten a little our past discourses. You must know, said she, that in the time of the flourishing Court of Lydia , there lived a yong Lady in the palace, called Elucina (from whose relations during the space of both our imprisonments, I have had many of these passages) as this beautiful Lady attended upon the Queen in her Bed-Chamber, so had nature bestowed upon her, as many perfections, as well could be received by any humane creature, appearing to the outward view of the world, like so many rich Jewels worn with the best advantage, to be used when she pleased: insomuch, as whether she spoke or moved, her very looks demonstrated, that she could alwayes command her self, without taking the pains to study the decorums or formalities of other people: In a word, if any thing can be said to adde to her lustre, she was descended from such a house, as could not be surpassed (scarce equalled) in all the Countreys of the lesser Asia , either for antiquity or eminency: These admirable endowments of wit, beauty, birth, and breeding, made every body cast their looks upon her person, rather with thoughts of divine adoration, then ordinary passion, since as love was too high a presumption, whereby to attempt her Majestick chastity, so were Courtly Complements, but small and simple entertainments for her worth and education: When she appeared in publick, people gazed upon her like some new risen Star in the firmament, not perceived before by vulgar eyes, and if she kept her self privately in her Chamber, every body waited her coming forth with a supream impatiency, as if their own happiness depended necessarily upon her presence: Yet I must say however, Paridenus (whom I formerly mentioned to be a sufferer for the Kings cause) being more eminent then the rest of Courtiers, both in regard of the Queens favour and his own handsomeness, not onely pretended to her love, but was conversant in her retirements: When she walked abroad he alwayes attended her person: When she continued in her Lodgings, none but this young Nobleman had freedom in her privacy: In fine, at all publick meetings, who but Paridenus was suffered perpetually to gaze upon the beauty of her eyes, without any contradiction, whilst others in a manner starved their thoughts at a farther distance: Notwithstanding this esteemed happy party, had the opportunity of these earthly blessings, yet could not all his endeavours ever reach a pitch high enough, to make her either in love with his desires, or gain so much as an opinion that she esteemed his vertues: For whether by constraint or election, Polinex suddenly mounting into those places of command, that had not onely the power of the Kings Revenue, but of his private Councels, by which means Elucina might be pleasur'd in her affairs, she by degrees waved the conversation of Paridenus , the more frequently to use the company of Polinex ; but this handsome Lord, not being able belike to brook either his Ladies neglect, or his own conceived disgrace, instead of wisely tempering his passions, whereby to win again the lost love of Elucina , who perhaps had but an intention, to try and make use of both their services, one day in a furious manner, entred her Chamber, and began thus to expostulate. How is it possible, said he, most glorious Elucina , that those eyes that onely give light and lustre to the Lydian Court, can look upon the deformities of Polinex , but with marks of contempt and disdain; especially when other objects of more worth and esteem, present themselves to your consideration, not onely with affection but humility? Shall a few painted words, falsly esteemed eloquence by unskilful people; that rather are taken by vulgar opinion then true knowledge, make you go inconstantly from your first principles, accompanied by those services, which my heart for so many years continuance, hath sacrificed to your beauty? Can the Nobility of your soul be stained with ignorance, in making so unproportionable an election, not worthy the least thought of one deriving their extraction, from so pure a birth? Must Honour and Youth suffer by your injustice, when shapeless Polinex shall be compared with those decorums, that nature hath bestowed upon Paridenus? Or shall the craft and subtleties of that dissembling Monster, who can love nothing but himself and his own ambition, prove the disgraces of my self and Family, onely because you are pleased, to give Polinex a seeming creation, which the Gods never intended to one of his form and disposition? No, no, beauteous Elucina , said he, never think that Paridenus will thus calmly be dispossest of his undoubted right, but rather is resolved, whole kindreds shall suffer for the injury, if you become not more just and constant in your affections. Elucina was something amazed at the first breaking out of these passions: Yet considering the youth and seeming vanity of Paridenus , whose chiefest perfections onely consisted in the well wearing of his apparel; and withal reflecting upon the solid worth and magnanimity of her new favourite, besides the need she might have of his continual assistance, in those affairs belonging to her pensions, which as she knew, would give her both support and lustre, amongst those of her own profession at Court, made him quickly this short and sharp reply. Paridenus , said she, I wonder not so much at your passion as at your mistake, since you seem in your vain fancy, to deny me those priviledges, that belong to every ordinary woman, and yet can pretend no right at all in me, either by purchase or conquest; especially when you might know very well, that what your self hath of most esteem, is derived principally unto your particular, from the bounty of my favours and countenance: Truly I would not have you so much over-value your person; as not to see when all the world else doth, how much those high parts and abilities in Polinex , that make him admired, if not adored by almost all the Lydian people, surpass your superficial Courtships: You tell me of youth and beauty, as attributes appertaining onely as you believe, to those of your profession, which I prize at a very low rate, in comparison of those endowments of the soul, made up in him for fame and eternity: Neither do I say this, for that there is any cause to tax my proceedings, concerning either of your entertainments, since I am not yet chusing a servant, much less a husband, but to advertise you, that you more disparage your self, in speaking ill of Polinex , then you gain credit with my thoughts by the attempt, since I can interpret it nothing else but vain glorious malice: In fine, I am determined, for all your indiscreet mutterings, to love, respect, and favour whom I please, and if at that rate you be weary of your attendance, I grant you more liberty, then it should seem you are willing to allow me; that is to make what other election you like for your future addresses. As it was thought these passages caused Paridenus to put off his Loyalty to his Prince, since after them, he not onely publickly sided with Dimogoras , and his Faction, but the great Senate of the Kingdom then sitting at Sardis , (which Dimogoras at that time seemed in a manner to command) presently summoned Polinex to appear before that assembly, to make speedy answers to all the accusations, that should be brought against him, as they pretended by the injur'd people: What his defences were, I shall not need to repeat; for that the world sufficiently knows their consequences; onely as you know, they brought him at last to lose his head by the common executioner. It may easily be imagined what thoughts, these actions created in the afflicted bosome of gallant minded Elucina , whose nature was as full of honour as compassion, being a like grateful to worthy Polinex , for those courtesies he had performed concerning her pensions, as sorrowful so brave a man should perish without any guilt. First she called all the Gods to revenge the fact: Next she vow'd her self a perpetual enemy to Paridenus , until either he should clear the aspersion, that was cast upon him by the whole Court, or perform some acts worthy of his honour in that particular. 'Tis true by many endeavours he sought to regain her opinion, conceiving now the chief object of his spight was removed by the death of Pollinex ; but he sound still the ears of Elucina so closed to his professions, that by the perswasion of no friends would she be brought to own his company; believing though he denied the combination, he had not done enough to her satisfaction either concerning Pollinex or the King. Thus I may say, for a long time rested these private affairs, until other difference of greater consequence, began to grow desperate between Euarchus and the Senate; when as he was for his more quiet and better safety, in a manner forced to forsake his royal and wealthy City of Sardis , whilst in the interim Hyacinthia the Queen sought also adventures in other regions, both for her own content and her Husbands assistance. These passages however I might best recount, as waiting upon the Queen in those journeyes, yet they not much relating to our present design, and being too tedious for particulars, I shall for the present forbear their repetition, and fall upon the proceedings onely of Elucina and Paridenus . To this purpose whether Paridenus as I said after these passages, and other confusions, were perswaded by the power and greatness of Dimogoras , or indeed knew himself to be something guilty of the late destruction and death of Pollinex , not onely stayed still after the King and the Queen in the City of Sardis , but visibly within a very short space totally quitted Euarchus party: Elucina in like manner not being provided for the Queens travels, or rather not willing to leave her large pensions in the hands of those she knew not how to trust, was constrained in some sort also to remain in the Town: As within the space of some few moneths (differences and war increasing between the King and the Senate) Elucina seemed to be much darkned in her former lustre (since a Court knows best how to value birth and beauty) so by degrees her pensions began to be taken from her by the directions of the Senate, pretending they could better use such large revenues. These misfortunes falling upon Elucina as I have been informed, not onely extreamly dejected her high spirit, but oftentimes filled her brest with passionate and melancholly thoughts, if not otherwhiles forced from her, despairing expressions, insomuch as she would sit a whole day together in her Chamber without any company, that neither fitted with her nature, nor was agreeing to her education, which notwithstanding a kinde of necessity cast upon her, since as the Senate were not willing to comply, or shew any respect to those of the Kings party; so had she by her own voluntary act, absolutely banished Paridenus from her society and conversation: Paridenus finding belike he had now this Lady at his mercy, closing in the interim more strictly with Dimogoras and his prevailing faction, knowing withal that Elucina had both need of support, and could not well brook any neglect, either in addresses or conversation, again attempted a new reconciliation: This I say being offered her with a kinde of a seeming Courtly humility, accompanied by many earnest protestations of love and affection, which he had scarce ever done to the Queen in all her prosperity and glory, at last so wrought upon the heart or fancy of Elucina , that she admitted him within a few moneths to his wonted familiarity: It may be thought she allowed his new address out of these considerations, since her superlative wit, was apt enough to penitrate sufficiently into the nature and comportments of Paridenus: First she might reflect upon her own estate, and uncertain condition, the Court being dissolved, and the Senate bearing rule, whilst her self wanting for the present both friends and means to support her titles; neither did she know how soon she might be restrained in her person, having no advocates to plead for her safety, being of a faction that was not apt to finde favour in the City of Sardis: In the next place she could not but think, it was to little purpose, any longer to bewail publickly the death and slaughter of brave Pollinex , since neither tears or commendation, could bring him to a new life, or make his memory any more useful to her particular: These reasons I suppose caused her not onely to become more friendly to Paridenus than formerly, but even to resolve of some compliance with the current of the times: So that Elucina by this means, having wrought her person some kinde of credit with the Senate, by Paridenus endeavours and solicitation, hoping still to compass more real courtesies concerning the regaining, or continuation of her Court pensions, by degrees between her wit and beauty, began to contract intimate friendships with the wisest and most powerful men in the Senate, until at last she was admitted so into their private communications, that nothing could be well done, without the advice or direction of Elucina: but nevertheless of a sudden the Sword prevailing above the Gown, and the Army against the Senates authority, those people whom she chiefly trusted, and who most favoured her concernments, were by the commandment of Farezius the General sent into banishment; and however Dimogoras was not prescribed with the rest, yet was he disgracefully turned out of his place, as a person not sufficiently fortunate in his conduction: These new vexations coming upon Elucina , made her perhaps too passionate in her discourses, against those that were either the contrivers of these designs, or the executioners of the Souldiers purposes; and not being able belike to contain her thoughts within her own bosom, without such expressions as men in power are not willing to hear, she was oftentimes sent for before certain Commissioners to be examined, who reproved her for her supposed insolencies, and miscarriage concerning the present Government: 'Tis true she bore her self with so much majesty and subtilty in all her answers, that they were constrained divers times to let her depart, rather with flouts to their assembly, than satisfaction concerning her intentions. Elucina , although by her beauty and other excellent parts, had in this manner (in some sort) freed her self from the prosecution, intended both her person and quality, yet in her minde she could not be very well satisfied, in that she had lost all her power and interest in the Senate, by the late banishment of her friends, with the disgrace cast upon Dimogoras ; wherefore began every day more and more, to contract discontents in her restless and haughty bosom: so that one time by chance Paridenus coming into her Chamber, according to his custom, to give her a visit, with a kinde of a wilde passion she thus spake unto him. Is it possible said she, that we can with a most servile patience, sit still and see Euarchus lose his Crown, and Dimogoras to be turned out of his place, accompanied by the disgraceful usage of all the Nobility in the general? cannot the remembrance of all our former glories, when the Court flourished, stir up in our resolutions a competent courage, towards the vindication of such affronts, as are daily cast upon us and the Kings remaining party, by those now sitting in the Senate? Do not these things create in our souls, some desire of action, to stop the currant of our insolency, encreasing hourly upon our condition by overmuch giving way to these proceedings? Is it enough think you for young Paridenus , to court the unfortunate Elucina in her private lodgings, without attempting nobler designs, either to render us more happy, or less despised in the eyes of the common people? shall the Myssians who are now with some honour in the Field, be the sole restorers of the King to his ancient dignity, without one Sword drawn by any of his friends in Lydia towards the action? O you Gods, said she, what is become of the old heroical glory of the Lords of this Kingdom, who were accustomed to purchase to themselves and posterity, so much fame and renown, almost now buried in the ruines of popular ignorance and confusion? No, no Paridenus , either speak less or do more, for your own honour and my satisfaction, quitting these vain professions of love, that serve to no other purpose, but to adulterate your spirit, and weary me in impertenencies. Although at the instant, Paridenus seemed not overmuch touched with the words of Elucina , thinking them rather passionate fancies, proceeding from her discontents, which would again quickly vanish in her minde, than real considerations, grounded upon more mature thoughts and intention, at the present onely endeavoured to pacifie her spleen and choller: But finding by degrees, that they were settled in her imagination, his frequent visits procuring him nothing but scorn instead of satisfaction, being often denyed admittance into her presence, by those common Pages and worst Servants, that attended in her outward Chamber, he began to think, that there was something engrafted in her nature, which his endeavours had not arrived unto, that belonged either to his courage, or loyalty to perform: so that hearing Arranus began to advance with his Army towards the City of Cleosa , where Leonides was then besieged by Farezius , and finding also other disturbances to increase, throughout all the Kingdom of Lydia , he presently assembled together many young Lords formerly of the Court, and with them suddenly (however in a rash fashion) took the Field, against both the power and authority of the Senate. As I cannot much commend the proceedings of Paridenus , in quitting so slightly his Masters services, either out of envy to Pollinex , or some natural ingratitude in his disposition, being perswaded by spleenful Dimogoras and his prevailing faction, that Euarchus begun to decline in the eye of the world, so must I not much more praise in this action the Noblemans foresight, since no sooner was he entered upon his design (if it were any at all) but that his Troops were as quickly scattered, and himself taken prisoner without almost one blow struck in the quarrel, though some youths of eminent hopes unfortunately perished in the attempt. After that Paridenus was surprised in this manner, in a most disgraceful procession was he carried to a strong Castle, where he remained as I told you until he suffered likewise with Arranus and Leonides ; it being in my opinion the best part of his honour, both in regard of the cause, and the company. The news being brought to Elucina of her servants slaughter, which both her self, and some other of his friends had endeavoured to prevent, by delivering many Petitions to the Senate in his behalf, new discontents and rages began to be kindled in her breast; for however she might suspect the courage or conduct of Paridenus , yet because the Nobleman had been moved to action, as she might very well believe, chiefly by her inducement, she seemed more then ordinary troubled at his misadventure; however as I said, it was much doubted what esteem she had of his person, since his principal fame in the world was, that he knew best of all the Courtiers, how to wear his clothes handsomely; though in truth it cannot be denyed, but he dyed gallantly enough: These troubles and procur'd distempers of Elucina , meeting also with the greatness of her birth, and the highness of her spirit, which formerly had made her oppose the Queen her self in many petty contentions, could not chuse but so inflame her spleen, that too boldly (for her then present condition) she cast out most violent imprecations, with much disgraceful language against many sitting in the Senate; insomuch as one day when Elucina least thought of a surprize, she was suddenly seized upon, by a Troop of unmannerly and rude Souldiers as she termed them, who presently carried her to prison: The Castle where she was committed, was esteemed to be strong enough, to circumscribe any Ladies ambition how turbulent soever, notwithstanding her wit, might be deemed beyond the rule of ordinary Forces: From this place was she oftentimes sent for by the Senates Commissioners, to give an account, not onely of her actions, but her intentions: nevertheless not finding after many examinations, they could work any thing at all upon her settled resolutions, to give them any satisfaction in their demands, either concerning her self or others, at last they put on a determination, to use the worst of threats to supply that defect, as believing belike her nature was more to be terrified than perswaded: But this also in words not proving answerable to their expectations, they upon a time carried her under a dark Vault of the Castle, where they set before her eyes and imagination, all the several sorts of tortures they could devise, whereby the better to fright and dismay her feminine courage; telling her that unless she would resolve to confess, that which could not be long concealed, by any obstinacy whatsoever, they had both Commission and a Command, to make her dainty and pampered flesh taste of that bitterness, which could not be resisted long by humane power: Elucina first looking up to the Heavens, as if she apprehended the Gods injurious, then casting her eyes again upon her prepared torments, at last with a deep sigh let them know, that notwithstanding they might be so cruel, as to torment her body without any guilt, yet she hoped the immortal Powers, who beheld all the actions of men, would still so far defend her innocency, as to give her a perfect victory over all their intended endeavours: Upon this they demanded of her, whether or no she had kept any correspondency with Arranus the Myssian General in his late invading of their Countrey of Lydia? If I have said she, according to the known Laws of Nations, I am rather to be convinced by probable testimonies, than by violence to be constrained to accuse my self, especially when as yet publickly there appears no cause for the suspicion: They intimated unto her, that as she subsisted under the protection of the Lydian Laws, so was she not to bring for her defence the customs of other places, but rather in all things to obey the Senates peremptory orders, in regard they had power to force her to what they pleased without any more expostulations: She replyed, as she was not satisfied in her minde, how they could pretend unto any authority, when as the Family of Euarchus was not yet extinct; so on the other side, could she not be perswaded to those observations they challenged from her, since the same pretensions may be made, by any power how unlawful soever got and obtained: But said they, we command nothing but what is good and just, being warranted by the principles of the Gods Worship: Either then said Elucina , you worship false Gods, or have your selves no right understandings. After they had in this manner for about an hours space, endeavoured between threats and perswasions, to draw from her discourses, some consequences belonging to their affairs (however many thought, they rather aimed at a vain glorious victory over her spirit, then any need they had of her confessions) they at last again returned her into her wonted lodgings; nevertheless before parting they told her, that as for the present, they onely intended to make the Senate acquainted with her obstinacy, so must she not expect upon their next meeting, so many friendly complements, though perhaps her indiscreet fancy, might perswade her of the like usage: Elucina gave them no answer at all, as conceiving whatsoever she could say, would not any way satisfie their expectations, however perhaps it might exasperate their spleens to her further trouble. When the Commissioners had made the Senate acquainted with the deportments of this gallant Lady, the whole day was taken up almost in disputes; some would have had her tortured in good earnest; others again thought it best to put her to death privately: but at last considering that such rigour could serve to no other purpose, than to derogate from the gravity of their assembly, for the present let fall the dispute, as pretending other matters of greater consequence came in the way for diversion: yet however the business appeared to rest in this manner, between suspension and resolution, concerning a subject that was inconsiderable in their thoughts, within a few dayes (as it should seem not having forgot their spleen) they sent suddenly to her lodgings, certain Officers of their assembly. Elucina being then a bed, after they had enquired of some circumstances of her servants, attending in the outward room, with a kinde of resolute and rude behaviour, joyned with some terrible looks, they rushed altogether into her Chamber: she entertaining a little kinde of amazement in her countenance at these unexpected proceedings, it was not long before they told her, they came with the Senates authority, to search for such letters, which as they understood she had received from their enemies, to the disadvantage of the State and Commonwealth of Lydia: however she used many arguments both to excuse her self and divert their intentions, yet adding still more fierceness to their former behaviour, as they would not seem at all to be satisfied either with her language or her tears (notwithstanding they proceeded more from her apprehension of their disrespects to her person, than out of any sense she had of her own present danger) so did they presently make a strict scrutiny according to their Commission, both into her actions and about her head, until at last they even removed the clothes that covered her dainty limbs, scarce ever yet beheld by her own modest eyes: 'Tis true, Elucina took this usage, for the greatest indignity could possibly be inflicted upon her condition, since she valued in her nature, those decorums belonging to her honour, much above life or any punishments the malice of her enemies could invent: when they were thus parted from her lodgings, and she come again to her self out from that amazement, which their unusual deportments had caused, the tears with violence gushed from her fair eyes, accompanied with such execrations, as might have perswaded the Gods, to have laid a curse upon the whole world in regard of those injuries. In this posture I may say I left Elucina , when my self was taken out of prison, indifferently expecting either life or death at the Senates hands; and now according to your desire, I shall fall upon my own story concerning my escape. But as Roxana was about to begin another relation, they might hear the Hounds in full cry; and not long after, they perceived a brave hunted Stag, not very far from the Mount where they sate near the Dukes Tomb, to take a standing pool of water for his safety and refreshment. This accident as they thought, would destroy their farther communication for the present; whereupon Creses , either out of a passion to be thus interrupted, or being willing a little to exercise his poetical wit, told her, that he believed the Goddess Diana had a particular prerogative in that place, which caused him to make some doubt, whether or no she might not be something spleenful, that themselves had not rather attended the noble company in hunting, then to have complyed so much with their own senses, in seeking out an opportunity for their discourses: Truly, replyed Roxana , as the Gods must be pleased to excuse my age, concerning that exercise, since it neither suits with my vocation or humour, so I hope we have besides so many tutular Deities in Heaven, that have a regard to the welfare of Lydia , as we shall not need much, to fear her displeasure in this nature, knowing our thoughts to be earnest enough upon that subject: Yet I may suppose it, said Creses , for that her cruelty was sufficiently shewn in her revenge against poor Acteon who was of her own profession. No, no my Lord, replyed Roxana , let us wholly build upon the protection of Minerva , with whom you have so large a share and interest, both for learning and valour, and then no doubt the greatest danger will be onely, for the present to be interrupted in an old womans relation, that perhaps hath already too much tyred your ears and expectation. Madam answered Creses , when both eloquence and judgement are joyned together, let the subject be what it will, the matter or the relation must needs be profitable, especially to unexperienced youth; but meeting with the beauty and heroical vertues of gallant though yet unfortunate Elucina , the satisfaction transcends ordinary contents; wherefore I must conjure you by your justice, I may have the rest of your adventures, either at present if the seeming interruption doth not hinder the progress, or some other time when a better conveniency may be afforded: whilst they were thus contending with complements, the Deer of a sudden contrary to their expectation, not onely quitted the water, as it should seem finding himself sufficiently refreshed for another course, but also with some courage and violence, broke through the ring of all the Hunters, that appeared with the Hounds to have circumvented him for his life: which gave a new opportunity to Roxana , during the space the company again followed the chace, to prosecute her own story for Creses satisfaction, which as briefly as she could she performed in this manner. However said she I have told you already, the particulars of the lamentable if not unexampled destruction of the King, yet nevertheless it will be also most necessary to let you know, (because from thence cometh the ground of my own escape) that as soon as the Princess Cloria heard of her Fathers death, (which a long time we fought to disguise) all the passions that could possible accompany so sad and doleful a disaster, rather overcame her nature, than seemed to be entertained in her apprehension: First she called both Gods and men to witness of the horridness of the fact; which being finished, she began to take revenge of her own innocent person, that could as she intimated, live after the intelligence: But to be short, concerning those relations that cannot recal past things, and almost as little give any power to just punishments, all our endeavours with the expence of much breath, at last brought her to some temper; at leastwise to fears, what might probably happen to her self, if she still remained a prisoner in the Castle; since as I told her, it was not to be doubted; but they who had slaughtered Euarchus , would in like manner destroy Cloria if they could; or at the best endeavour to marry her to some obscure person of their own faction, whereby the better to prevent her title and pretensions to the Crown, if the Royal issue should fail, which could not but prove an obstacle against the march, between her and the now Duke of Cyprus Narcissus: As this last intimation wrought most strongly with her imagination, in regard of the sensible feeling she had both of love and honour, so by little and little, I brought her (though with much labour) not onely to think, but to resolve upon an escape, as we designed under the form of some borrowed disguise, that at last was contrived to be in the appearing habit of her Page, who was thought the fittest messenger we could pretend to send into Syria to visit the Queen; a humanity we conceived, could not be denied by the most cruellest enemies, that ever inhabited any place: I shall not need to tell you the particulars, how I procured a Pass in the name of the boy, by the means of Cratus the Cyprian Ambassadour, from the Senates General Farezius: When I had in this manner, after some few weeks time of consideration, conveyed the Princess safely out of the Castle, the youth and I in the interim staying behinde, not onely the better to obscure her flight, but to expose our selves to the hazzard of the discovery; I lost no while either to instruct him how he should carry himself in the Princess Chamber and apparel, or omitted any opportunity the better to muster up my own inventions, for both our securities, when the matter should come to be revealed, if before by some stratagem, we could not also free our selves from our confinement: I cannot deny, but the boy play'd his part so well within the Curtains of her Bed, whereby to prevent or entertain necessary visits, until my Lady should be got far enough out of the Lydian Territory, that for some dayes there was not any strict enquiry made after our actions, under a pretension of an indisposition contracted as we gave it out both in her minde and body, by reason of her Fathers death. But the Senate at last, whether putting on a countenance of more humanity to the Royal Family, or rather having some design to win the Princess Cloria to a certain kinde of compliance with their actions and intentions, in regard they determined to propose to her liking a Husband of their onely chusing, appointed a few messengers from their assembly to give her a visit, whereby to excuse the necessity of her confinement yet for some time, with the reasons of their putting the King from his Life and Government; however they would still think, as they said, of the honour and good of his Children: Upon their coming to the Castle where the boy and my self remained, and as they thought the Princess in her Chamber, according to her accustomed posture, the Governour of the place in all haste repaired to our lodgings; notwithstanding they found me there attending, yet I must confess I had difficulty enough in my thoughts to finde excuses, whereby for that time to divert their importunities, as pretending my Lady by reason of her indisposition, could not for the present be spoken unto, occasioned as I said, in regard of her excessive grief; for my desire was to delay the time as much as I could possible, until the Princess might be got out of the Lydian jurisdiction: In this manner things continued without any suspicion for some few dayes, the guard onely coming now and then into Cloria's Chamber, and seeing the Page lye in her bed at a distance made no farther enquiry; until in the end, the Senate either doubting some fraud, or rather disdaining to be kept off so long a space without satisfaction, by those they knew they had power enough to compel, again sent their messengers to the castle, commanding them, that if they should be any more denyed admittance according to their directions, they should setting aside all complements and respects, speak with her lying in her bed, though never so seeming sick, either in effect or by dissimulation. This I must tell you, whether I would or no, caused me presently to reveal all the mystery belonging to the Princess escape, withal assuring them, she was far enough out of their Territories, to be overtaken by what diligence soever: O you Gods with what an inflamed rage did they entertain these intelligences: presently after these Deputies joyning the Captain of the Castle with their authority, they committed both me and the boy to safer custody, and then went and made the Senate acquainted with all the proceedings: At the delivery of which intelligence, they called me old enchantress, and horrid traytress to the Countrey and Commonwealth of Lydia . In fine it was resolved by that Assembly, that as I had deserved justly the highest punishment could be inflicted upon any mortal creature, so did Farezius the General himself merit, not onely instantly to be turned out of his places of command, for having granted a pass-port without their allowance and privity, but to be publickly otherwise disgraced, with the severest marks of their displeasure: Not to detain you with all the circumstances belonging to the business; as it is thought Hercrombrotus shall suddenly succeed Farezius in his office, and the rather for that they understand the Island of Crete , begins again to be something powerful, against the Senates Forces in that Countrey, so did they appoint a day peremptory for the hearing my cause, or determining my punishment: At the time designed, I was brought and set before the Council; upon the dispute of the matter, some would have me burned alive in the open Marker-place, as a testimony of their justice and the peoples satisfaction: Others thought it more proper to detain me in a close Prison between four walls, to be fed with nothing but bread and water, in that manner to finish my wretched dayes, whilst the boy should be whipped to death for his offence, in complying in so wicked a design: A third sort wisht I might be buried in the earth quick, since by my crafty practices, I had been a means to deprive their jurisdiction of Cloria's person, who in some sort was esteemed the life of their hopes; neither wanted there a fourth company, that desired to seem more merciful than the rest, and gave advice to make me onely the common drudge of the City, to be imployed in all the vile offices could be imagined, in regard of my contempt and want of fidelity to the State, which they supposed would be a sufficient increase of my affliction and misery: But in conclusion, after all these numerous disputes, it was at last fully determined, my self with the Page, should be put into a small Bark, without either Meat, Sails, or Oars, and in that manner to be committed to the uncertainty of the Seas, whereby to fall upon some desperate fortune or other, since as they said, we had perswaded the Princess out of her own Countrey, from their loving protection, to seek hazzardable adventures she knew not where. Within a weeks time this intended though uncertain voyage was to be put in execution, by certain officers appointed to that purpose: wherefore, as soon as all the materials belonging to the cruelty was prepared, both the boy and my self were conducted to a Haven in the Province of Caria (a Proclamation being first made, that no person under the pain of death within the Lydian Government, should give us any manner of relief, if by chance our Bark happened to arrive upon any of the Coasts.) And there one lowering evening, when the windes seemed to be in a contention among themselves, we were drawn by another Ship, many furlongs from the Land into the Sea, to be left to the disposure of the merciless or insensible Waves; however appearing to our apprehensions much more pittiful, than those prosecutors that had by their power and authority, designed us to such a desperate adventure, which tasted of nothing but cruelty and horrour: As in this state and condition, we remained incompassed about with all the hazzards, that could belong both to a boisterous Sea and a dark element, so were our thoughts filled with those imaginations that afforded not the least comfort to our hopes; since however the Suns light, and more propitious chance, might by fortune conduct our Boat to some Harbour of safety, yet in regard of the strict injunction, that none should relieve us in our wants, we were in our minds, as far to seek concerning our preservation, as if the storms should continue still, without any relaxation or abatement; for that we could not possible reach (having no provision) any other shore, but what belonged to the immediate jurisdiction of the Lydian Government: so that turning my self wholly to the thoughts of another world, I attended the coming on of a speedy death, with that patience was necessary for my present condition; nevertheless, I could not chuse but be a little comforted, when I reflected upon the safety and escape of my dear Lady and Mistress the Princess Cloria , for whose sake and preservation, I had been willing to offer my self a sacrifice; notwithstanding I must confess, I was much afflicted at the hard fate of her poor Page, who however he was by birth a stranger, yet he had most constantly shewed a faithful diligence in all our services and concernments, to this very time of both our misfortunes; and the rather was I troubled at his misery, in regard he had been onely commanded thereunto by my designs: but as my pitty served either of us to little purpose, since neither the winds ceased their violence, nor could we be confident we were near any land within many dayes sail, so were we forced, to put our confidence in the supernatural power of the immortal Gods, as the best refuge we could expect; for notwithstanding we might hope the morning would bring some comfort to our more than tired senses, yet the raging weather had already driven our beaten Bark upon the Seas in that sort, that the Suns chearful countenance would contribute nothing at all to our safety, having no materials convenient to guide our Ship, to any Haven of security or repose: These imaginations I may say created a certain kinde of new horrour in our thoughts, that differed not much from the worst of despairs; which as it should seem the boy apprehending to be fixed in my minde, after some circumstance with watery eyes he used this language unto me. Lady and Mistriss said he, as I have been alwayes instructed in my youth by your documents, that the all-powerful Gods, will neither impose or can suffer injuries to be inflicted upon innocents, without a competent revenge, answerable to the transgression of such as do them, so must you again give me leave to demand in this necessity, how it comes to pass at present, that we and others apparently endure multitudes of miseries, without any manner of seeming redress or relaxation, whilst in the interim our enemies and wrong- doers insult over our calamities, not onely with a quiet security, but a most flourishing prosperity in all their actions, which shews in my opinion, that the Gods, are either deaf to our complaints, and so by consequence not immortal as they are taken to be, or else those very principles are deficient of themselves, that have all this while taught us the belief. After I had studied for some while for an answer, at last I made him this reply: 'Tis true said I, as those documents in the general are to be held, by all persons that profess Piety and Religion, since without it we must deem the Gods either unjust or defective in their power; so of the other side ought we to consider, that however we and others sometimes suffer by their permission, what perhaps immediately doth not belong particularly unto the seeming offences committed, yet have we still a certain hidden frailty in our natures, that must necessarily be punished in some sort or other by the purity of the Heavens, lest it increase to that inordinacy, that will bring us in the end to eternal perdition; wherein appears the greater mercy of that omnipotent God, who created sublunary things, rather for our use and benefit, to bring us to a better life, than whereby to give us pleasure and content in this world; which perhaps we having abused contrary to his institution, therefore he returns them upon us as convenient chastisements; however the instruments themselves, after a time, may be cast into the fire to burn for doing of the office, accompanied with other their offences, since it is not to be doubted, but the best of us have often anger'd that majesty mentioned, either in pride, ambition, or sensuality, which his justice could not suffer, without imposing some temporal afflictions upon our persons, to purifie the dross of our imperfections, that else would remain to our destruction; for that his all- seeing and purifying eyes cannot behold blemishes of any nature to be admitted to his presence: I must confess said the boy, that however I have heard it reported, that the nature of the Gods, is thus to be reverenced and worshipped upon earth, by the generation of mankinde, yet I cannot chuse but also a little to wonder, that for the better demonstration of their own power and majesty to the inferiour world, they do not speedily and visibly punish wicked offenders, when as the contrary perhaps, doth detain some people with opinions, as if there were no deities at all, at leastwise who had any regard or consideration of humane actions, by which means the wicked are encouraged in their oppression, and those that are more pious and innocent, sometimes become less confident, or rather very doubtful in such principles, as have been taught them in their infancy: for however there might be a power that first made and created all things, since probably they could not proceed from nothing, in that we see by experience that every generation is procured out of causes conducing to the effect, which Philosophy, I must tell you I learned from my Master, when I went to School, before I came to your service, yet it may be very well suspected, whether this power have any consideration or regard to our actions, otherwise then to maintain a succession and encrease upon earth, onely for the continuation of the world, as it fareth with Birds, Beasts, Plants, and the like? I could not be said Roxana) but a little startled at these objections of the Boy, as well at the sharpness of his wit, as where he should come to hear of such arguments? Nevertheless I thought it something necessary to rectifie his opinions, in many things by such reasons as I had heard in this particular, so that presently, I returned him this answer for his farther satisfaction, being a time proper as I thought for both of us, to reflect upon the Gods mercy tending to eternity, since we had small hopes of longer subsistance here: 'Tis true, said I, some fools or other impious persons, may be of those opinions you have mentioned, but such fancies will quickly vanish, when it shall be considered, that as this great God that created the world by his omnipotency, must consequently be perfect in every kinde concerning his goodness, knowledge and intentions, so would he never have made a world to no purpose, (which consequently must follow) if some end conducing to eternity were not intended therein; so that if we, for whom as it appears the world was made, should but onely live to produce others and then dye, what priviledge had we above the vilest creatures? Or what end had God in the making of man, if for nothing else but to come upon a stage for a time, whereby to play a part, and then go out, and never be seen more? Which were an impertinency, that scarce any person in his right wits would commit in humane actions, since for the most part we our selves do or intend any work, but with intention that the effects should last longer then our own times: And God being not onely omnipotent but immortal, and so consequently eternity it self, would never have begun a design that could ever have an end, which can be no other then the Creation of Mankinde; for that it is apparant, all things else upon earth are but intended for him and his profit; being used as instruments onely by this God to that purpose: So that it is a meer vanity to think, that there is not some eternal reward ordained for our sufferings, if we do well in this life, which others shall not enjoy of the contrary demeanour and fortune. Truly Mistress, answered the Boy, as I have alwayes been of this opinion in my thoughts, and doubt not still to continue it in my actions, by the favour of the immortall Gods, (it being now the greatest comfort we can have in our present afflictions) so must I not deny, but your pious and wise instructions, have much confirmed my belief in many particulars, which gave me also these hopes, that either we shall by some accident or other, be preserved from these desperate dangers, that seem to threaten our destruction, or receive shortly that recompence we expect for our sufferance to all eternity; however, said he, give me leave to tell you, that although my self should perish upon these uncertain Seas of trouble without remedy, yet to my last end I shall ever pray, you may be delivered from the same fate, and become settled in some haven of rest and quietness? Hereupon I asked him presently, why he did not desire rather his own preservation then mine, for that I was old as I said and could not at the best long continue in the world, whereas he being young and lusty, might enjoy many years of prosperity upon earth? He suddenly replyed, that as he was old enough to perceive the vanity and uncertainty of all humane things, that made him not overmuch in love with their possessions, so did he very well know, how far my capacity was above his, to be useful either in the particular or in the general, to profitable transactions, that concerned the Princess Cloria , since I had in so many difficulties to that purpose, demonstrated both my judgement and affection: besides he told me, that he had been during his service so much obliged to my lenity and goodness, that in meer gratitude to my bounty and affection, he could do no lesse, then make these demonstrations of his faithful and reall thoughts, towards my preservation. O you Heavens, said Roxana , with what a feeling resentment, did I entertain this unexpected discourse, noting with admiration the good disposition of the Boy; and truly I must ingeniously confess unto you, that this very consideration in his behalf, did not onely cause me at that time to shed many tears, but in a manner at the instant did take from me all apprehensions of both our dangers; being as it were overcome by far greater passions: In conclusion, not to entertain you over long, though with a subject of this nature, after I had with as many expressions of affection, as I could possibly use towards his kindness, endeavoured in some sort to raise and nourish his hopes, not onely concerning our assurances to enjoy a better world, if we failed in this, but also to be freed yet by the Gods goodness from our present miseries, we set our selves more attentively to observe the course of the Bark by the Suns progress, whose bright shining then, not onely afforded us the commodity, but the element in a manner being freed from mists and clouds, scarce any winde at all blew to our disadvantage, that the night before had carried us with such extraordinary violence and hazzards upon the Seas. In this posture I say we continued for all that day, and for the most part of the night ensuing, which however it did not much fortifie our hopes, in regard we did not well know whither we sailed, and less could we be assured to arrive at any Haven of safety, yet for that the weather was fair and the Seas calm, our senses seemed to be something pleased, until that about two hours before morning, our Bark began again to be assaulted by another storm. Thus were we again tost upon the enraged waves, insomuch as some while they seemed to elevate our ship near to the heaves, and then in an instant appeared to bury us under ground; and not seldom breaking in their encounters one against another with such noise and horrour, that we cast off not onely our former satisfaction, but contracted every minute in our mindes new despairs; nevertheless in all these agitations by the Gods goodness, we had the fortune to be delivered without prejudice from all the splitting Rocks, that every where were dispersed in those Seas: After we had been thus as I say beaten for many hours together in these dangers, by degrees the skies cleared to our apprehensions, until visibly the Sun appeared to our view; insomuch, as in the end of all our expectation, we rather found our Bark becalmed, then agitated in any kinde backward or forward: By this time our appetites, whether sharpned by the stormy weather or not, being much questioned by nature, whilst the violence of our fears and troubles gave us other employments, began to call our memories to reflect (at leastwise mine it did) upon that cruelty our enemies had used, in depriving us of all means of provision to sustain life; however we might escape shipwrack, that was intended our condition: This consideration put me inwardly into new lamentations, since I supposed at the best, it would be long before we could arrive at any shore, that could afford us relief necessary for our preservation, in regard command was given to the contrary upon all the Coasts belonging to the Lydian Jurisdiction: Notwithstanding that I carried these thoughts in my minde, yet for that I would not bring a new affliction upon the Boy, I determined not to put it into his apprehension, which continued me for some time in a very sad muse without speaking one word. As I was thus sitting at one end of the Boat, the youth belike observing my melancholly posture, demanded of me, why since I had preached unto him such comfortable principles in divine assistance, concerning eternity and fruitions in the next world, I should appear my self so dejected in my countenance, as if I harboured nothing but thoughts of despair in my troubled bosome? I must confess I knew not well what answer to return: Yet at last, because I would reply, I let him know, that although Religion and other considerations commanded us in every worldly accident, to put our chief trust and confidence in the power and mercy of the immortal Gods, nevertheless the frailty of humane nature, could not altogether put off those thoughts much less the sensuality of our condition, when as the necessities were pressing in a high kinde, as they were at present; for although said I, we should have some hopes to escape the hazzards and fury of the Seas, yet wanting as we do all provision for sustenance, we cannot at last do otherwise then dye miserably, being near no Haven probably, that will afford us any relief by many dayes journey: If that be all, said he, we shall do well enough, and with that presently informed me with a kinde of a smiling countenance, that however the crafty malice of our enemies, had endeavoured to deprive us of that benefit, yet himself by a provident fore-cast of the heavens, rather then of his own industry, had put it into his minde to be furnished with some necessaries to that purpose: With these words he drew out from under his garment, a certain little Satchel full of that meat, which was most portable, being least to be suspected by the Searchers, for upon the embarkment he had pretended that the Budget contained but some youthful trifles of his own, which belike the curiosity of those Ministers no farther looked into at the present: In conclusion, we both fell to the satisfying of our appetites, with some greediness of nature, leaving our other discourses of divinity and morality, until a more proper season, when our dangers should appear more horrid to our apprehensions: After we had done, (making use for our drink of that water, that had fallen in the Boat from the skies) we rested a little contented, concerning that particular, in regard we believed we should either perish on the Seas by storms, or happily finde out a convenient harbour of repose, before we should need any other refreshment: As by this means we became pleased, though not absolutely satisfied, since our imaginations wrought us still to consider, the desperateness of that voyage we had in hand, so within an hours time or thereabout, casting our eyes often in the interim upon the working waves and vast waters, we at last perceived though at a far distance as we thought, some appearance of Land: This sight (or rather probably might it have been a fancy, since despairs not seldome create Chymera's instead of realities) gave us a certain hopeful content, for that we had never enjoyed the like, since our departure from the shores of Caria , however upon more mature consideration it did not seem much to mend our condition, for that presently we remembred we had neither sails to make use of the windes, or Oars to conduct our Bark to any Haven or Landing-place whatsoever; besides at the best, we had not skill enough as we thought, to make use of such instruments, if we had had the luck to be possessors of the benefit, never having been practised in the trade: These were my apprehensions, although the Boy contrary to my knowledge, before he came to my service had lived in a ship; but whilst our imaginations and view together were thus employed, (humane nature being notwithstanding something delighted at the very apprehension of possibilities) the youth of a sudden perceived one of the Boards of the Vessel that lay in the bottom, to be loosened by some accident from the rest; wherefore removing a little the planck out of its place, underneath he found lying a convenient Hatchet; formerly used as it should seem by some Workman in the Ship: His apprehension hereupon quickly brought to his consideration, that a commodity and profit might be reaped thereby, towards the better conducting of the Bark upon the Seas: So that at last he resolved if it were possible to hew out something resembling Oars from the materials: To this purpose instantly taking the Iron Instrument in his hand, within an hour and a halfs time, he had formed two handsome things like Oars, from the longest and thinnest boards he could finde in the Vessel: With these strange instruments, that both necessity and good fortune had contrived, both my self and the Boy quickly went to work, which the more conveniently I must confess we might do, in regard the Seas were at that time very calm; in this manner as I may say, directing our course still towards the Land we had perceived, though at a great distance; until at last something before night, we arrived within a few furlongs of a certain Craggy Island, resembling rather many compacted Rocks in the Sea, then any place fit for habitation or relief: Although this happy progress extreamly comforted up our hopes for the present, yet the darkness coming on apace, and the windes again beginning to bluster, we were put to new exigencies, as how to conduct our Bark to some convenient landing place, notwithstanding we discerned the shore before our faces: But the Moon appearing by good fortune at that instant a little above the Horizon, the sight afforded us no small probability of safety, which gave us new encouragement in our work: nevertheless approaching nearer and nearer the Island, with intentions to land, of a sudden when we looked least for the violence, there came a stormy blast, that not, onely drove us against a sharp Rock which lay concealed in the Sea from our sight, but split the side of the Vessel in such manner, that the water in an instant covered the bottom thereof, at least three foot deep, which you may think again in our opinions put us beyond all possibility of escape: In this manner I may say the period of our last expectation, became perishing in our imagination; for the Boat being full of water, and we not knowing where we were, or possible to be relieved as we thought by any accident, we turned suddenly all our thoughts and cryes, towards the mercy of the Gods in another world, more violently then formerly, having no manner of hope in this: But the Heavens as it should seem beholding our cause though not our sins, sent us a present aid beyond almost a miracle; for many Fishermen at the instant being upon the Seas, setting their nets in the Moon-shine, hearing our pittiful acclamations, suddenly came with all haste to our assistance, and within half an hours time, by the help of their small Coricles, not onely relieved our necessities in that extremity, but conveigh'd us all wet as we were to the firm land upon the Island: After we had given the Gods a short thanks for our deliverance, they made a great fire in one of their poor Cottages, whilst in the interim they enquired of us the adventures of our fortunate escape, as well as by what dismal accident we came into those parts: we were something scrupulous to let them know, either our qualities or the occasion of our strange journey, though we strived to give them otherwise what satisfaction we could in requital of their courtesies: After in this sort we had refreshed us, we endeavoured to rest our weary Limbs that night, with what commodities we found in the house, being resolved the next morning to seek some conveniency, to carry us from that place: To this effect, when day came they told us, that the Island of Rhodes was not many furlongs distant from their barren habitation, whither if we pleased they would use some means or other to conveigh us safely; from whence, as they said, we might finde conveniency enough, to be transported either into Greece , or what part of Asia we would; so that considering our Bark was not capable of a farther journey, and knowing the Governour of the Island himself had shewed alwayes an affection to King Euarchus concernments, though he kept nevertheless a certain kinde of neutrality, with the Senates proceedings, for his better security, we soon determined to put that proposition in execution: Notwithstanding we found within a day or two a passage convenient for the Island of Rhodes , yet seeing the people were unwilling by any long entertainment of ours, to draw upon themselves the danger of a war from the Senates spleen, when I had saluted the Governour with his vertuous and gallant Lady, being provided by them with some necessary conveniences for another voyage, we again took the Seas for our transportation into Cyprus , where I doubted not but to finde my Lady the Princess Cloria safely arrived: But whether the Senate had been advertized by any of their spies, which for the most part they keep in every Countrey, or whether our spiteful destinies had a minde again to cross us in our design? we were in a manner no sooner out of the Haven, but were pursued by two small Barks belonging to the Lydian Government: I must confess we had much a do to quit us of the surprize; insomuch as for a day and a night they chased us with violence, like a couple of swift and courgeous Greyhounds, some fearful and timorous Hare, who still by windings and turnings sought to avoid a destruction near at hand: One while the Master of the ship had a minde voluntarily to yield to the mercy of the pursuers, rather then expose himself and his Vessel to the danger of being overtaken, when as he supposed he should obtain no quarter: But we prevailing with earnest entreaty, joyned with other conjurations, accompanied by faithful promises also of reward and satisfaction upon his arrival at Cyprus , he was content at last to bide it out to the uttermost hazzard: In this posture notwithstanding we remained for some nights and dayes, now and then hiding our selves in Creeks and by Rocks, to deceive if it were possible our enemies by stratagems, when our Marriners seemed weary both of working and rowing; and for the better encouragement of the Seamen in their care and labour, I would sometimes take an Oat in my hand, though the Gods know to little purpose, but onely to let them see, how much I esteemed the consequence of the journey. In conclusion, after we had wrought thus for our lives, for many hours together, one dark and misty night above the rest, we had not onely the happiness totally to avoid their pursuit, but within a very small space to be landed safely (though weather-beaten as we were) in a great Haven Town of the Island of Cyprus . When that Roxana had thus made an end of her discourses, Creses presently taking her in his arms told her, that as these strange passages of her escape, were almost beyond the consideration of the greatest miracles, so did he wish with all his heart, that the heavens would crown future events (belonging to the affairs and fortunes of Prince Arethusius ) with the like success: from this they returned again to talk something of the Boyes constancy and affection shewed in his service, with other communications of variable natures, until the day being a little spent, they both rose from their seats, and walked about the Tomb for their better recreation; The monument it self was built four square, at the upper end of it, was curiously cut out in white Marble, the statue of Fame sounding a Trumpet, with this inscription at the feet in Capital Letters.  To thee the Father of our liberty, We freely dedicate (that all thereby May know our gratitude) these lines of praise, Not onely to continue in our dayes, But whilst that Fame so much desir'd by men, Hath worn her self with age to dust again, And in the interim, let other Countreys learn By our example, to be freed from scorn; Flourishing in a Trade, that may command The Seas, if not augment with power the Land; All this great Duke belongs unto thy right, In conquering as well by subtlety as fight. These Verses being writ in Arabick Characters , and expounded by Creses to Roxana , she desired him to let her know something more particular of the Dukes story; the rather as she said, for that Narcissus her Lord was descended from that originall, in whom she hoped to have more then an ordinary interest, by the late marriage of her dear Lady and Mistress the Princess Cloria: Creses complyance quickly seated them both again in their former places, which after a while brought forth this new discourse, from the eloquent esteemed tongue of Creses . It was in the time Madam, said he, when as Herezius (as I formerly told you) had cast about his dangerous opinions both of rebellion, and other separations from the Gods Worship then generally practised in the world, that this Duke lived in the Countrey of Cyprus , whose wit, titles, and extraction, seemed to be parallels one to another, though neither of them again to be equalled by any of the rest of the Nobility: Whether these benefits of nature and fortune, raised his minde or no above his duty I will not say, but thus stories speak as I have read: Not being able to brook the Government of the Kings Deputies in these parts, he was observed for some years, not much to favour his prerogative; so that after a while, finding the doctrine of Herezius began to fructifie amongst the Subjects of these Nations, in regard it seemed to intimate to all persons (desiring sensuality, and not affecting subjection) a certain wilde kinde of liberty, in what they pleased both to Gods or Men; however for the the most part guilded with Hypocrisie and dissimulation in outward carriage, of a sudden not onely retir'd himself into the Kingdom of Armenia , as it seemed from under the protection and jurisdiction of his own Prince, but withal to the wonder of the Governours took him a wife, that openly profest the opinions of Herezius , so much destructive to Monarchy and obedience, as they conceived, though himself as yet outwardly seemed to maintain other principles: Nevertheless this quickly gave him a very ill character at Court; for as the Egyptians are by nature suspitious, so are they in command insolent, wherefore fearing none in these countreys were able to cross the Kings Government but this Duke, and doubting he might have both the will  & ability, to do it in time if not prevented never suffered him to enjoy any places of absolute authority, without putting either a restriction upon his power, or a jealousie upon his actions: Whether the Kings Deputies for their over-much suspition concerning this Prince, were in the fault or no I will not say, but so it fell out, that he not onely retired himself by degrees from all Court-employment, in the interim sorting his conversation more frequently according to the customs of the common people, (for that no Nation love better an equality then themselves) but within a very short space by an Army he had raised in Armenia , with the strength of his wives friends, and Herezius opinions, he invaded suddenly the Countreys of Pamphylia , where the Court then remained: After these breaches you may think nothing could possible be pieced again of confidence, for that the Egyptians were proud, and could not endure to seem less in the eyes of other Princes, then they formerly had been, and the people were resolved (being so violently possest with these new opinions, that Herezius had lately broached to the disadvantage and danger of all States and their Governments) never to come again under the same Jurisdiction, without those conditions, that might in a manner make them masters of the Countrey: insomuch., as within a very few years a general flame off discontent and violence, was kindled both in Pamphylia and Cyprus ; and necessity constraining either party to form convenient Armies, for the better compassing of their designs, the Duke was chosen general of one side, as a brave Egyptian Commander of the other: These proceedings occasioned divers Battles and Sieges of several fates consequences; In all which the Dukes wisdom and valour, were held the only obstacles to the King Progress and Conquest, which the Court at the first thought to have performed in some moneths without much troubles or loss: As things remained in this posture, without moving any whit seemingly forward to the Kings honour or profit, there was a Souldier of the Army, that one day suddenly came into the Councell Chamber, and told them, that he was determined if they approved his enterprize, by a stratagem newly contrived by himself to slaughter the Generall: However this became not onely entertained after some expostulation, but executed afterward with much desperation, yet before the time it was effected, the Duke was sent to by the Governour of Pamphylia , to return to his former obedience, otherwise all his Lands and Goods as he said within the Dominions and Jurisdiction of the King, would be seized and forfeited for ever: The politick Nobleman suspecting rather a fraud in the intention, then a reality in the meaning, returned quickly this answer, that notwithstanding he conceived it no small misfortune, for a person of quality to be without a house for his accommodation, yet he conceived the mischief would be far greater, if a Duke should chance to want his head: In the interim he dispatched a Messenger to the old Queen of Lydia , who had then newly fallen out with the Egyptians , not onely to make her acquainted with all these passages, but to shew the willingness of the people of Cyprus , to submit themselves under her Jurisdiction and Government, since she had formerly both quitted the Religion of Delphos , and was become an enemy to the King of Egypt ; rather chusing any new subjection, then to be longer under the old tyranny, either for their estates or consciences: In fine, many moneths had not passed before the Souldier as I told you put in practice, what had been determined against the Dukes life; and perform'd this action with such prosperous success according to his design, that meeting him in an entry when he came from dinner, accompanied by many of his friends and servants, he forthwith stabb'd him to the heart with a short weapon, which he had provided to that purpose: The Souldier having committed the fact had escaped from being taken, if by fortune one had not discovered him amongst the croud, since the people were in so confused an amaze at the accident, that they rather minded their lamentations for the slaughtered Duke before their eyes, then any way made search for the offender that had committed the fact: No sooner was the Souldier notwithstanding apprehended, but all the exquisite tortures that could be devised, were inflicted upon his suffering person, not onely to satisfie the malice of his enemies (the people in the interim crying out with unrelenting exclamation for revenge) but also with an intention to extort other confessions from his mouth, towards as was pretended the saving of the Island of Cyprus from ruine: However nothing could be extracted from his discourses, but that he conceived the Duke to be disloyal to his Princes, and a hinderer of the true worship of the Gods, in whose service as he killed him, so was he willing to dye himself. The Inhabitants I must tell you, gentle Lady, were so outrageously displeased at this unexpected slaughter of their Duke, whom they esteemed not onely a Saint in his Religion, but a sufferer for his Countreys good, besides the estimation they had both of his wisdom and valour, that notwithstanding the many propositions they had from other Nations, as namely out of Syria and Lydia concerning the offer of a new General, yet would they pitch upon no Commander but his eldest Son; a man in truth that gave little way to his Father, either for prudence, judgement, or conduct of an Army: After they had established him in all his places and command, they presently erected this magnificent monument to his Fathers fame, to be continued in after ages, for his eternal glory, accompanied with the inscription I have already explained to you in the Lydian language. But my Lord, said Roxana , after he had finished his discourse, however I must confess I have heard sufficiently, of the old Dukes worth, fortune, and policy, during the time of his life, though the Catastrophe and period of his last end, seems to my apprehension something ominous, nevertheless I cannot understand in my weak reason, by what lawful right, he was first vested in the jurisdiction of this Island, and so by consequence how his predecessors or posterity, can claim a just inheritance in the Government: For it appears to me, the Countrey formerly belonged to the Kings of Egypt , being taken from his possession onely by the power of the Sword; or at the best by the willing consent of the people, who were that Princes natural Subjects: Truly Madam, replyed Creses , as this Title hath been much disputed by all sorts of pens and discourses, during the compass of very many years, so can I onely say thus much for the claim in question, that the possession hath been now settled in divers descents, which at the first was disputed by force of Arms, and the King of Egypt himself having lately confirmed the right, both with his treaty and consent, in my opinion this of necessity must conclude all disputes to the contrary, since never a Kingdom or State in the world is enjoyed upon other terms; however I cannot deny, said he, but the combustions of the Island of Cyprus , have occasioned for this latter age all the distempers of Asia ; neither did the Senate of Lydia take the rise of their proceedings, as I believe, from more pregnant examples, concerning the Gods Worship, or for matter of Rule and Government, then what were derived from the opinions of Farezius , which upon the matter taught nothing more then disobediency and sensuality, two inclinations favoured and cryed up most, by the rude and unlearned multitude, though many of refined wits, have thereby fish'd in troubled waters, for their own ends, and advantages, or else it had been unpossible for this work to have prospered in so many Countreys of a sudden, utterly against the Philosophy of Government, in regard every popular State (however at the beginning it got footing never so much by violence and craft) in the end again turns for the most part into an absoluter way of Monarchy ; but said Roxana , you seem to intimate to my apprehension by your discourse, as if the Island of Cyprus yet retains rather the face of common Government, then that of a King or an absolute Prince: Truly Madam, replyed Creses , as that cannot be denyed without partiality, since the Duke cannot so much as go to the wars, by the constitutions of these Countreys, without being accompanied by such as shall be alotted him to oversee his actions, so do I wish with all my heart, that my Lord Narcissus may so order the matter in his affairs, concerning the natures and dispositions of these people he now seems to govern, that he may not need the assistance of other parts, to keep him alwayes in his present possession, as it fared lately with King Euarchus our own Prince in the Kingdom of Lydia , since no doubt but the same spirit of pride and disobediency predominate in both Countreys alike among the common people, whose property was ever to spight or envy the better sort, and worthiest persons, either in fortunes, titles, or glory; neither can it be denyed, but that the Hereditary Monarchy of Lydia , was as well established before these troubles, as any other Government through all the hither parts of Asia , both for succession and constitution, however as you see it is now fallen to nothing, or at the best to a miserable uncertainty: But as Creses was proceeding farther in his discourses of this nature, they might see the hunted Stag followed again by the Hounds, and many of the Royal Company; who took the same pool for his refuge, which he had formerly done in the morning; and not long after the Princess Cloria , with her Brother Arethusius came also towards the place in a gentle hand gallop, as it were to be the more noble witnesses both of his tears and slaughter, himself being (if not an embleme) at leastwise a creature ordained more particularly for the delight of Majesty then any other: Upon this Roxana and Creses rose from their seats, only promising to one another, that notwithstanding these diversions, they would endeavour e're long to meet with some more coveniency again, whereby to finish out the rest of their discourses: Cloria assoon as she saw Creses and Roxana coming towards her from the Mount, she began prettily to jeast with the old woman in this maner: Governess, said she, I perceive now according to your former maximes, declared as you may remember when we travelled together in Creses company, after our escape from the Castle, where we were imprisoned by the Senate of Lydia , that the practice of hunting was not used by women of the ancient world, in that you have as it should seem perswaded Creses to be of the same belief, who no doubt else would have been at the present of our society: Yet better reflecting upon the matter, said she, I may have some cause to fear, you go about to bereave me of the interest, I desire ever to have in his thoughts and affections, by coveting a more near relation to your own particular; nevertheless I do profess it can no way be my fault, since I shall omit neither industry, nor power to continue me in his opinion, if either my Brother Arethusius , or my Lord Narcissus will contribute effectually at my request to his satisfaction: Most admirable Princess, presently replied Creses , the Gods could not be but plentifully satisfied, with the tender of such an interest, as speaks your favour in any measure; neither can more happiness and honour be desired, then to have the heavenly reward, as alwayes to behold those eyes, that sparkle forth nothing but Majesty and delight to humble hearts, with a kinde of an awful reverence, to the considerations of the best and greatest of men that live upon earth: And yet I must tell you Creses , replied Cloria , that your bold expressions at my marriage, though in poetical strains, could not chuse but have given occasion of some jealousie in the thoughts of my Lord and Husband, if his nature and experience had not been more then enough satisfied with confidence, both of my truth and intentions: Madam, said Creses , it is not for mortals to contain themselves within the compass of ordinary passions, when deities such as you are appear in their full lustre; O Creses , replyed the Princess, these feigned and flattering pretentions, are not of force sufficient to wipe away the forfeitures of your crime, if both my husband and my self were not entirely gentle and merciful on your behalf: If reverend love, or rather may I call it a due adoration, be an offence, said Creses , not to be pardoned in me, look upon your own over-mastering perfections, that gave the first occasion, why such a sacriledge was committed; but if you think it either just or convenient, I suffer without a willing cause, I shall not refuse any punishment, whereby the sin of your own misprision may be expiated, and by that means become a sacrifice instead of an offender, since my nature or loyalty could not avoid, what hath hath been acted in that particular: Well well, replyed Cloria , to put off all farther disputes, for that I see your wilfulness is no more to be corrected, then the perfect eloquence of your language to be equalled, I here call my Governess for a witness to this agreement, that since you pretend to some shews of repentance, though in a dark manner, still retaining in your thoughts a certain intention to continue your crime, I do publickly forgive what is past, hoping in time you may upon better considerations mend altogether; which at leastwise will demonstrate my mercy to all kinds of people, not infected with your intemperancy: With these words the Princess, (whilst the other company were busily employed in several discourses concerning those accidents that had happened in the chase) commanding both Roxana and Creses to follow her, presently went and sate down in one of the shady arbors belonging to the woods, though at some distance from the clutter of the people; where after a while Roxana in the interim placing her self at her feet upon a small hillock, Cloria more seriously began this communication with Creses , who stood by her in a respectful obedience, whose nature and affection (as it should seem) could never do otherwise from the time he first knew her person in the Castle, where she had been a prisoner under his jurisdiction. Creses said she, as I hope you are sufficiently satisfied, both with my pardon and affection, so must we now fall upon more necessary and considerable discourses, concerning my Brothers affairs: To this purpose you may know, that the Commissioners of Myssia now remaining at Paphos , are come from the Nobility of that Countrey, to make tender as they pretend of their best services, in setting the Crown upon the head of Prince Arethusius: what their proceedings formerly were to my Father, is not unknown to all the world? and what they may be yet to his Son the Gods onely can distinguish? with these words the sweet Princess began to weep, yet in such a manner, as her tears neither expressed a violent passion, or her present demonstration of sorrow, too much diminished the grace and beauty of her countenance; after a while she returned again to her discourse in this manner: The confidence nevertheless that Meliander hath in these peoples intentions, makes both my Brother and Narcissus my Lord, presume more then ordinary upon the success: In short, a journey speedily he must take towards the Countrey of Myssia , where however the place hath been sufficiently fatal to the prosperity and life of good Euarchus , yet the people now generally (as I am told) confessing their own errours, have promised a new loyalty and fidelity: Besides I must let you know, that both Argylius and Lycius , seem as forward as any others now to receive him as King, if their hearts go along with their professions. When the Princess had made an end of this short discourse, Creses a little smiling upon Roxana , intimating as if Cloria were something too confident of the truth and honesty of those people, especially of the Lords last mentioned, desired her Highness, since she had already done him the favour to trust his breast with those secrets, which before he was not made acquainted withal, for that he had been as he said particularly debarred from those Councels, by the express desires of the Deputies themselves remaining at Paphos , she would be pleased yet farther to let him know, something of the conditions that were propounded to her Brother Prince Arethusius ; for that as he said, he conceived the Countrey of Myssia , at leastwise the contrary faction, would never willingly admit him to be King, whereby in any convenient way, to return the Government or jurisdiction over into his hands, without restrictions and limitations prejudicial to his prerogative: Upon this demand, the Princess entered in a little kinde of muse, and then made him this reply, with a certain vermillion blush in her fair cheeks, as if she apprehended, that Creses taxed in some sort her overmuch credulity: 'Tis true Creses , said she, I must confess your jealousies in some manner meet with my own apprehensions; but as necessities must for the most part put people upon desperate resolutions, so can I not deny, but that the conditions propounded to my Brother, in many things are scarce to be entertained in the thoughts of a free Prince, since he is obliged thereby to put much of his jurisdiction into the hands of his esteemed enemies, besides he is pressed to take a solemn Oath, before he enters upon the priviledges and dignity of the Crown, not onely to profess publickly their Religion, now generally practised in the Kingdom of Myssia , but also to maintain the factious Priests in their pretended rights, if not usurped commands: and that which is worst of all is, his attendants are to be limited according to their denomination, lest as they alledge, sinister Councels might in time, divert him from those good inclinations, which his own nature would have for the Countreys welfare: O you Gods Madam, said Creses , what conditions are these to be put upon a Prince, whose worth, extraction, and education can scarce be parallel'd? deserving rather the sole Government of the world, than to be thus limited, both in his command and honour, by a people, who have neither truth in their meaning, or ever had loyalty in their actions: The Princess finding, that Creses was apt to be transported by his own passion in her Brothers behalf, told him, that as both her self and others, were reasonably well satisfied with the intentions of many of the Myssian Nobility, so must she desire him with a little more patience, to understand from her, those reasons, which perhaps he had not yet heard of to be alledged, for a certain kinde of complyance at the present, with the people of that Nation, whereby the better to settle the Government thereof: In prosecution of which point said she, it must be weighed in all competent understandings, that the Countrey of Myssia cannot long subsist without a King, not onely in regard of its constitution, by way of fundamental Laws, but also by reason of those factions, that would arise from their wanting one head to govern, necessarily required to over-rule all the growing disputes, that daily could not but be ingendred amongst the Nobility and better sort of people, every person striving with violence to be uppermost in authority and command: And who is fitter for this office, than he whom succession hath placed in the Throne? Next it may be also considered, that whereas the Senate of Lydia hath turned by their decrees and resolutions, that Government already into a popular Commonwealth, without the seeming desires, if not contrary to the wills of Myssia , so they will be sure as near as they can, to keep their own Countrey from falling into the same fate; wherefore by consequence, must suffer their present King (notwithstanding any conditions they shall now make with him to the contrary) to re-assume to himself again his rightful jurisdiction, and ancient prerogative; for that it is to be supposed, their restrictions are onely grounded upon some small mistrust they have of his actions, lest those at the instant he seems most to favour, should come in time to be chief Commanders of the Nation to their disadvantage; which their ambition cannot by any means brook, as it may be presumed after such a long and bloody contention; so that they will be sure of his intentions and disposition, before they absolutely let go the reins of the bridle out of their own hands, to be governed and commanded onely, by their Princes variation or inconstancy. Thirdly, it is well known, that the Religions now most prevalent in both Countries, are clearly opposite one to another, us well for the opinions as in the practice, which must ever hold Lydia and Myssia at odds, without any hopes of reconciliation; and therefore probably, no fear of a combination to my Brothers prejudice in that nature, since the chief doubt that can remain is, lest the Myssians like the Lydians , should also endeavour to turn also their own Government into a popular state, which nothing but meer desperation ( Arethusius not complying with their offers and desires) can envite them to do. Lastly we must reflect upon the unfortunate differences amongst all the Princes of Asia , insomuch as it is unpossible, that my Brother as yet, can expect any succour from their assistance or power; and less will they be ever willing to lend him, if he make not to himself first some foundation to work upon, concerning the inclinations of his own People and Subjects; in that it is no easie matter to conquer any Countrey entirely, without particular factions to be raised of the natives; wherefore Myssia joyning with Lydia as it now stands, that benefit could not possibly be procur'd, whereas of the contrary being at difference, the accession will not be difficult, to be brought about in a short time with the Gods favour: Thus Creses , said the Princess you have my arguments, concerning a present and a politick compliance with the Myssian Nobility, rather then for Arethusius , to continue any longer tost in uncertain Seas of discontent and trouble, without either action or Kingdom; and more especially when my own Husband Narcissus , is so far as you see at present, in being able to afford him that assistance, which may be necessary for the speedy conquest of the whole, without the vigorous compliance of other Princes, that he hath more than enough to do, to keep down the factions in Cyprus it self, already raised against his own proceedings; the natures of the people as it should seem, being either alike in both Countries, or some equal spirit, if not perswasion grounded upon the Lydian success, governs each with the same desires and ambition: These were the arguments that Clorir used, to perswade the opinion of Creses to an agreement, or at leastwise to be contented with the complyance intended concerning the Myssians: but as he was ready to reply something to Cloria's reasons, they were both interrupted by Arethusius and Narcissus , who coming to the Arbour, where the Princess had set her self, the communication became suddenly altered, since they presently fell to discourses belonging to the chace; which however it seemed more proper for the season, yet Creses , whose thoughts were not inclinable to that profession, was not a little sorry for the occasion; so that he and Roxana in the interim, taking a turn or two in the neighbouring Woods, he began to tell her, that he feared, notwithstanding the probable hopes and strong arguments, both the Princess and her Brother, had of the Myssians fidelity, they would in some sort or other be deceived by the treachery of the Nation, who were a people observed, scarce to keep faith with any person, when either their covetousness, or ambition came in the way to be satisfied; witness as he said, their proceedings with Euarchus the late King, having alwayes bestowed on them multitudes of favours of all kindes from his very Cradle, as well in the particular as in the general. Although I cannot deny what you say, replyed Roxana , nevertheless desperate diseases must have sharp and dangerous cures; and therefore as you see no Prince or State at the present is willing, or rather in plain truth able to assist Arethusius in his title, rights, and pretensions, it were a very hazzardable madness in him, not to comply with the Myssian offers: Besides I must tell you, that it is now commonly reported, that Argylius himself, doth not onely make tender to take an Oath for his future fidelity to the Crown, provided the Prince subscribe the conditions that shall be agreed upon, but also voweth before the immortal Gods, that he had no hand at all in his Fathers death, of which he hath been formerly accused: So that these things being published to the world, the Myssians will not onely seem to be excused in the thoughts of most people, if they should afterward enter upon designs to Arethusius prejudice, either with the Lydians or any other Nation, but also perhaps, he will be held a Prince of some slothful disposition, wanting courage necessary to perform actions, meriting a Kingdom; wherein both his youth and honour, if not his valour also, cannot but extreamly suffer in the opinion of all sorts of conditions, which you know are the attributes chiefly to be preserved, either for conquests or submissions: Many such discourses passed between them in their communication, that seemingly rendred Creses better satisfied than in the beginning; however, his earnest affection to Arethusius and his cause, continued him still doubtful of the Myssians purposes; and the rather, for that he was informed the Commissioners remaining at Paphos , had in express terms debarred both himself and others, from waiting upon the Prince into their Countrey: When Roxana and Creses had thus ended their short expostulation, they returned again to the rest of the company; where after the finishing of a small collation, provided for the entertainment of the Princess Cloria in her hunting exercise, all the Court repaired again to the Castle of Paphos . Whilst Arethusius , with his Sister and Narcissus the Duke, endeavoured to divert still their melancholly thoughts, for the late untimely death of Euarchus , which of a sudden they could not put out of their mindes; sometimes by conferences, and earnest disputations with the Myssian Commissioners, hoping to draw them by degrees from the seeming rigour of those propositions they had offered; otherwhiles again for their better divertisement, spending their times in entertainments and hunting, of a sudden the Ambassadour of Cyprus Cratus , came to the Court at Paphos , where having first presented his duty to all the noble company in a general way, at last he more particularly let the Duke his Master know the effects of his imployment. In this relation, he not onely told him all the passages concerning the Kings destruction, but in like manner of the carriage and disaffections of Zutphynon his own fellow Ambassadour, as well belonging to the Lydian State, as to himself and Government in particular: He informed him also, as a thing of most consequence, that he had brought over the Seas with him (although in another Ship for the more colour) a person nearly active in Euarchus death, who intended if he could procure the interest, to raise factions and stirs in the Island of Cyprus , against his own power and prerogative; since the Commission was to treat with the States of the Countrey about Trade, and other leagues of friendship, both without his privity, and against his authority: Narcissus became so much enraged at this intelligence at the first hearing, that he swore by the immortal Gods (though be hazzarded an open rebellion amongst the people, whom he knew to be sufficiently addicted in their natures, both to equality and envy) he would have as well the one, as the other openly punished for their contempt and presumption: But however the courage of the Duke for the present, seemed to be excessively exasperated, yet Cratus by good reasons and gentle perswasions, brought his thoughts to consider, the inconveniency that might happen thereby, since the people as he said, were violent in their dispositions, to maintain the priviledge of such strangers, that came any way to treat, or propound beneficial things for the Commonwealth; and so by consequence, would scarce suffer a violence to be done without an orderly prosecution of justice; therefore rather counselled him, to bring Zutphynon to some examination, before the chief Councel of the Countrey, where himself would be ready, to make good the particulars of a formal process: As these reasons a little qualified the Dukes passions, so did he resolve shortly as he was advised, to call Zutphynon to an account, for his unfaithful and disobedient proceedings in the Kingdom of Lydia ; in the interim resolved to suffer the other person, who had been so spightful against the Kings life, to live freely notwithstanding, without any molestation, being as he believed the better way, to try the affections of his Subjects, concerning his own desires. But in the mean time valiant Creses , whether being inflamed by his own natural courage, or enraged with the sense of the justice of his cause (the apprehension of the cruel death of Euarchus coming into his minde) went presently to Salamine that rich City, where he understood the foresaid messenger from the Senate of Lydia was newly arrived: Long he had not remained in that place, before he was fully resolved with what insolencies, he not onely seemed to contemn the authority of Narcissus Duke of Cyprus , but by many demonstrations both in his words and actions, delighted exceedingly in the late execution of the King; as if the fact had been pleasing and acceptable as well to Gods as men: Scarce could Creses contain his spleen within the bounds of any moderation, until he should finde out the best conveniency, to bring about his purposes, with most security to his own person, knowing how many people were in the Island of Cyprus (especially of the City of Salamine ) that neither affected the Lydian Monarchy, nor could well brook the present jurisdiction of young Narcissus : So that meeting the party one day, as he was walking with some other company upon the wharf, either for his better recreation, or more pleasure, saluted him suddenly with this fierce language: Villain said he, was it not enough for thee to continue thy triumphs in thy own Countrey, for that sacred blood of the King, which hath been spilt with so much insolency, but the same impiety or a worse, must carry thee into other parts, by an intention to raise the like spirits of mischief and seditions? With these words, using no other circumstances, he wisht him instantly to draw out his Sword, either to justifie his proceedings, or defend his life, if his courage, or confidence, would dispute either in a noble way of tryal: 'Tis true the party took his weapon in his hand, whilst the people like frighted sheep every where accompanied onely by amazed countenances, thought upon their own securities; but he whether overcome by his fear, or transported with his apprehension, instead of encountering Creses in an equal way of contention, retired as fast back as he could, towards the Sea-side, until at last as it were compelled thereunto, by his desperate and unhappy fate, without any defence at all tumbled into the water; where after struggling with the waves for a long season, he at last yielded his soul, either to the mercy of the Gods, or the punishment of the furies; notwithstanding many of their Boats strived to have saved his life: It was not needful in this confusion of the people, to bid Creses to shift for himself, since he knew the strict Laws of Cyprus , were accustomed with severity, to prosecute both persons and acts of this nature: Wherefore taking advantage of the amazement of the multitude, he quickly retreated to a private house of his acquaintance, and afterward in the dead of the night, repaired again to the Town of Paphos : But scarce had he time given him, to make a particular relation of the fact, and in some sort by discourses and counsels of his best friends, to digest his own conveniencies, either for an escape or to provide for some defence, before he was followed with exclamations and violence to the place of his abode. Notwithstanding the rage of the people seemed not to be very great, in regard of the destruction of this messenger of the Senates of Lydia , yet Zutphynon having raised some faction in the Haven Town of Salamine , by reason of his power and interest, amongst the Magistrates and chief Merchants, pretending their Laws would be broken, and their priviledges obstructed, if justice should not be speedily done upon the offender, whereby not onely trading might be endangered, but a bloody War would necessarily follow, between the Nations of Cyprus and Lydia , both the Duke and the Councel thought it convenient, to publish a decree, that whosoever against the Laws, had committed that fact of violence upon the Ambassadour, should in no case be freed from his punishment; and more especially for that the party slaughtered, had been a Native of their own Countrey, although most of the time of his education, had been in the Kingdom of Lydia , by which means he came to be a principle instrument in the death of the King Euarchus: These proceedings were intimations sufficient, to perswade Creses to quit the Island, with what convenient expedition he could, since otherwise he was sure, either to expose his person to the hazzard of a tryal, or be an occasion to bring the Dukes Government into some troubles; and therefore rather chose to be himself a wanderer in other Countries, to seek his fortunes (which his excellent parts gave him encouragement enough to hope for) than to undergo a shameful or desperate convention before people, who he supposed would not respect much, either his vertue or his cause; however many seemed to exclaim exceedingly against the untimely and cruel death of King Euarchus . The banishment in this nature of Creses from their conversation, retired both Cloria and her Brother Prince Arethusius , to a certain house of pleasure belonging to Narcissus , not many furlongs distant from the City of Paphos , not onely the better there to have the liberty, to recreate themselves in that sollitude, but also more conveniently to consider, and digest the propositions sent out of Myssia , whilst Commissioners on both sides, were disputing in other places of their validity: The Palace it self was seated upon an entire plain, no more than one story high, being supported on the out-side, with huge Pillars of Ceder-wood: It stood as it were in a certain standing lake, though continual fed with divers springs of running water, insomuch as every night several Draw-bridges about the house, were pulled up for the greater security of the place: There belonged also unto the habitation, a small Forrest resembling a Park, where in the compass of a wall, were enclosed many brave horses belonging to the Duke, with other cattle of several sorts, both wilde and tame, that appeared either fit for the chace, or delightful to the eye: The Frontice-piece represented a large Tarras, where on the top were some Turrets designed into pleasant Banquetting-houses for repose, so to be esteemed, in regard that art seemed to have bereaved, or at leastwise couzened nature of her skill, in placing a beautiful Garden in the air, whereas usually it ought to be upon the earth: Neither wanted there flowers of all sorts to adorn the rarity, though preserved in that manner with much pains and care. One day the Princess Cloria brought her Brother into a private Gallery, appertaining more particularly to her own appartiment, than to any other of the lodgings: It was furnished with many excellent Pictures, almost of all the great Monarchs of Asia , with some others of other Countries: The first portraicture they beheld, was that of Orsames King of Syria , who seemed represented with such a countenance, as if a Souldier had put on the resolution of a Saint, being both black and lean; yet wore he his hair long and curled, according to the manner of the Court: His dress was also mixed, having a Royal Mantle cast over his Armour, wearing upon his head onely a wreath of Lawrel, that notwithstanding signified conquering in his disposition, though he nevertheless carried a Book of Devotion in his hand, on which he appeared earnestly to meditate: Both his Crown and his Scepter lay at his feet, in some sort neglected by himself, though his Page held his horse of War ready saddled by his side, as if he had been ready to mount upon his back, for some sudden piece of service, to be performed for his more honour. The next Picture to him, was that of the King of Egypt plainly habited in black, with no other ornaments about his person, but a rich chain of Diamonds, at the lower end of which hung Jasons golden Fleece, known onely by the inscription: As many of his great Titles, were writ over his head in large Capital Letters, so was the room where he remained, adorned chiefly with divers Pallets and Cushions of Crimson Velvet, whereon seemed to sit several young Damsels of variable beauties, which he smilingly beheld: his own complexion was between fair and sanguine; in so much opposition to the former draught, that the hair of his head was cut as short as nature could well allow: so that it might be said, the one had a Souldiers habit, the other an amorous aspect, which perhaps sufficiently painted forth their dispositions, dividing in a manner equally their thoughts and inclinations to Mars and Venus : The third portraicture set out to the life, the shape and complexion of Artaxes great King of Armenia , who rather held his dominion over many Princes, by a voluntary submission to his power, then that he was able to compel them to any obedience, either by succession or force, since as in his own person he was onely elective, so had his Subjects divers priviledges annexed to their several States, which oftentimes they used to his disadvantage and prejudice; so that not seldom he was induced rather to beg their aid, than to endeavour to compel it: but that which kept him in most safety, was fear of faction amongst themselves, and a kinde of ambitious desire they had, to have him in denomination accounted the supreme Prince of Asia: Besides their Countrey lying nearest to the Emperour of Persia , with whom they were accustomed alwayes to have War, had continued the succession in his line for some ages past. Fourthly, there was there to be seen, the lively representation of the Arch-Flamin of Delphos , sitting in a Chair of State, crowned with a Golden Myter , whose grave and venerable aspect, seemed to become his place, as his dignity did his person, wherein he appeared to deserve the spiritual Monarchy of the world, which he challenged in a manner without contradiction, from all the Potentates of the earth: His habit differed nothing at all, either from the antiquity of his looks, or the honour of his calling. Many other Pictures there were in the Gallery of more inferiour people, as namely that of Philostros great Favourite to Orsames , with the Prince of Arabia riding a gallant horse in warlike accoutrements: Queen Andromida was there also painted in her best youth and beauty, playing with other Damsels in a Garden by a Fountain side, however one might perceive in her countenance, a certain air between solemn and merrily disposed, demonstrating as well her extraction as breeding; and the rather, for that two religious women seemed with careful (if not) over-awing looks to behold the exercise then used, neither to exceed to lightness, or proceed to passion: Mazarius had in like manner his portraicture with Prince Conderosus , accompanied by divers others of the Syrian and Armenian Nobility of both sexes, for the better lustre of the place. After they had competently viewed these rarities, in regard of the excellent workmanship of them all; at last they came to a piece, wherein was described a young Lady, whose years seemed not to exceed the time of fifteen at the most; her beauty might be said, rather to resemble Minerva and Diana , then the Goddess Venus , or her Son Cupid , however ignorant youth oftentimes bestowed in their opinions the prize upon the latter: Her imployment as appeared by that draught, most delighted in study and contemplation, since she was onely accompanied there by her Books, with her eyes attentively fixed upon them: Her hair and complexion inclined altogether to white, participating much of the Northern climate, wherein she was bred: however her looks appeared something grave and serious, yet were they mixed with a certain kinde of joveality in shew, as if notwithstanding, it proceeded more from her desire of friendly compliance, than out of nature and inclination: she had a Crown lay upon a table near her, covered with a Velvet Carpet, with a chair placed at her back for her convenient repose, though she made no use of it, by reason of the seeming activity of her thoughts, that aimed alwayes to be imployed: When Arethusius had sufficiently beheld this Picture, as wondering a little at the dress, if not at the beauty, he demanded of his Sister, who it might be that it presented; the Princess smiling upon her Brother told him, that perhaps she might prove to be some new Mistriss of his own: he not being perfectly satisfied with that answer, she added this relation to her former words: I do not doubt said she, but you have heard of those strange victories gained by the King of Scythia , not many years ago in the Kingdom of Armenia against Artaxes ; insomuch as it was thought then by many, that he would have outed that mighty Prince, in that conquering prosperity of all his Dominions: But the Gods, whether envying as some said, that Commanders glory, or that he was sent onely by a heavenly power for some time into the Countrey, to punish the peoples sensualities, of a sudden there was a period put to his fate; for in the last Battle that was fought between the two Princes, in which was designed the absolute determination of the quarrel, by the one or others final overthrow, the King of Scythia unexpectedly lost his life, by some desperate hand, never yet known to the world: However, nevertheless his prevailing General got the Field, which continued still the differences on foot, until the late peace, that was made between the two Nations, that ever since hath settled this young Lady, Daughter of that great King of Scythia , in the quiet possession of all her Fathers hereditory territories: This young Queen I must tell you, however she hath been much solicited to marry, both by her own Subjects, as well as by many other Forreign Princes, whereby to continue a succession in the same blood, by which she is possessour of such large Territories, yet hitherto she seems to give no ear at all to the motions, but rather retires her self from company, delighting her thoughts onely with contemplations; sometimes notwithstanding hunting of several wilde Beasts in pleasant Forrests, belonging to her Lands and Revenues of the Crown: Neither can any person judge of her future intentions, though often she is heard to complain, of the cruel usage of King Euarchus our Father, with the rest of his posterity: These prenostications Brother, said the Princess, make not a few believe, that she hath some secret affection to your person, as well out of the gallantry of her disposition, as the intimations and motions of love: and the rather am I induced to the conjecture, for that in both your infancies, this match hath been propounded by a Scythian Ambassadour, when the Court of Lydia appeared to all Asia , in the most prosperous and flourishing condition: What Arethusius would have answered to these intimations? or what effects this discourse might have produced cannot be known? in regard a messenger in the interim advertised Cloria , that her own Lord the Duke of Cyprus , was newly arrived in the Palace-yard, from the City of Paphos , which made both her self and her Brother, to descend with some haste to give him the meeting: After he had saluted Arethusius , and kissed twice or thrice his lovely and most beloved Wife, they all three ascended presently the stairs, where after a while, being all retired into a small withdrawing room belonging to their lodgings, Narcissus told Prince Arethusius , that for the week past, he had been disputing very fiercely, about some conditions with the Commissioners of Myssia , towards his further safety and advantage, concerning his intended journey and reception into their Countrey: Arethusius desiring to know more particularly, what had been concluded to that purpose, the Duke gave him this account. As I cannot said he, much commend my own industry in your behalf, and less the rigorous dealing of the Deputies, who are as they pretend limited by the strictness of their Commission, so must I rather perswade you to a compliance, with their seeming desire, to have you amongst them as their King, than any longer to depend upon the uncertainties of Forreign assistance, since you see Syria and Egypt are so exasperately engaged one against the other, that it is unpossible as yet to hope for any manner of reconciliation towards your aid and benefit; in that they each of them strive, rather whether shall make the Lydians their friends, than express the least intention to declare War with them: What the God have determined in that nature, is not yet revealed to the inferiour world? wherefore if you should any longer continue without action, when these propositions are presented to your consideration, (although something disadvantageable for your state and dignity) perhaps most people might believe, you aim more at security than dominion, however the contray we know well enough; and this no doubt would exceedingly hinder your future proceedings, when the heavens might appear propitious to your purposes: for some wheels must alwayes be kept a going, to put your party in minde of your intentions and desires, who else may become over cold in your affairs: what cannot be got from your enemies by treaty, may be obtained by industry and valour, since they will be ashamed to see you play the part of a glorious Commander, and not reward your endeavours with love and obedience, having your person amongst them, as an example of bravery and goodness: Besides it will more please their appetites, to bestow upon you your own with a liberal seeming freedom, than to have you exact it from them by a constrained way, in making conditions to that purpose, wherein as they may suppose they shall compass two ends: the one of gratitude from your particular, the other not to be esteemed all this while in the wrong; for injurors are more jealous of their actions, concerning the opinion of the world, than other people that have never been to blame; and ills that have preceded, must be maintained by greater mischiefs, if the suspicion in some sort be not taken away, by a seeming forgetfulness of what is past, to procure more confidence in those that were faulty: In the interim it is better to be chief or greatest in any title or interest, than to wave the active part wholly, because the supremacy cannot be absolutely obtained of the sudden, though perhaps with patience and time it may be effected at the last. A Sword in a Princes hand at any rate, doth better demonstrate his right, than pleading his cause by words, being absent from his Subjects: What the life and estate of Narcissus can do for Prince Arethusius , shall not be wanting to his utmost endeavour; who wisheth that the Island of Cyprus were so absolutely settled to his obedience, that he could as readily as he would, command the hearts and purses of his people; until when the Gods, and a Kings courage must supply the defect, lest too much violence or suspicion obstruct both interests, not again to be recovered by after industry: In conclusion the agreements are (for better cannot be obtained at present) that presently you must make a voyage into Myssia , where they have promised, you shall not onely be received with all honour and fidelity, but upon your sealing the articles, to maintain the priviledges of their Senate, which your Father formerly refused, as also take an oath to be observant to the Worship of the Gods according to their customs, be Crowned King of the Countrey without contradiction; when as they say, both Argylius and Lycius with all the Priests, and other Nobility of their faction, shall become your most humble and obedient Subjects: Nevertheless they further expect, that you make some publick demonstration before the people, declaring your sorrow; for that neither your self or King Euarchus your Father, have so readily yielded in times past to these conditions, which omission hath caused so much blood and slaughter in each Kingdom. When Narcissus had delivered thus much to his Brother-in-law in the hearing of Cloria, Arethusius cast his eyes upon the ground presently; where fixedly he stood for a pretty space, and then lifting them up again towards heaven, he uttered these words: Is it possible said he, O you Gods, that the power and justice of your Majesties should be thus derided by a rebellious Nation, that hath no regard, either to the gratitude they owe to the memory of my dead and glorious Father, since they go about to traduce the very faculties of his noble soul, that remains now enthroned amongst the immortal deities, or can yet look upon his living though unfortunate posterity, with considerations of compassion or justice? O Brother Narcissus said the Prince, be not you an instrument of this unworthy submission of mine, when as besides all these required contracts, as I am informed, I must not carry along with me so much as any servant, that will be either faithful to my purposes, or not be absolutely at my enemies dispose, witness their exception both of Creses , and many others, governed by the same principles: Narcissus finding the passions of the young Prince, were likely rather to encrease by more discourses, than to become perswaded by his rhetorick, until such time as his apprehension could be better tempered, told him, that as for the present, they would leave off farther disputations, (since his own journey was intended chiefly for recreation and divertisement, in the company of himself and his sweet Sister,) so had he commanded some of his Falconers, if he pleased to attend in the Park, to shew them a stately flight at the Hearn, which perhaps would afford them all a singular content, for that the season as well as the place, was proper to that effect. Though the troublesomeness of Arethusius thoughts and greatness of his spirit would scarce suffer him to admit of trifles, when his apprehension was violently possest, with the care and solicitation of his own affairs, yet being confident of the good intendments of his brother-in-law towards his particular, and withall most willing to give contentment to his dear Sister the Princess Cloria , who seemed to carry the same soul in her bosome as himself, was quickly won to the compliance, concerning that noble and delightful exercise: so that after some time, in which their Horses were preparing properest for the sport, they all issued out into the small, though most delicious Forrest, where being no sooner arrived, but the fowl was presently put to the Mount, who within a quarrer of an hours space, having in the interim almost hid her body in the clouds, a dainty cast off Jerfaulcons were loosed to the chase: It was a delectable sight to see, with what a courageous industry, the two Royal Birds sought to get the winde, whereby to become the better masters of their prey; whilst the poor Hearn on the other side, with as much labour and craft as nature had bestowed upon her, strived to avoid her own destruction: But as soon as the Hawks had fully attained to their pitch, then was the combate to be admired in perfection, since whensoever the Hearn found her self ready to be assailed, by her deadly though gallant enemies, she would turn her body in the air suddenly upon her back, and with her long beak, and both her feet defend her life to the best advantage, seeing those pointed weapons were more then dangerous to be attempted: Then again having in this manner protected her self for a long space, however not being alwayes able to tontend in that nature for want of breath, she would take a new flight, wherein as her prosecutors followed her with violence, she would slice out behinde, whereby to blind their eyes with her excrement, that they might be the more discouraged to pursue: Then the gallant Falcons finding her stratagem, endeavoured by dent of wing to get above her, that in their several stoopings, they might have the more power to become victorious; until at last the poor Bird, having altogether lost her strength by often combating, was made an intire Trophey of their conquest, falling with her enemies half dead at the feet of the Royal spectators, as a sacrifice both to cruelty and delight: This sport being finished, in the companies return it so happened, that as Arethusius was galloping his Horse, out of a youthful bravery, over the neighbouring plain with some of his followers, not careful sufficient as it should seem of his way, of a sudden he got a most dangerous fall; for however his attendants came speedily to his rescue, yet the violence of the shock, had so far disturbed his outward senses, that notwithstanding all their endeavours employed industriously to his remedy, yet he remained a long time in a swound: In the interim, both Cloria and Narcissus made haste to the place, as doubting some disaster had chanced, though a far off they could not distinguish of particulars: The Princesse when she found her Brother to be the onely object of her fright, not alone the gentle tears trickled down her fair cheeks, but many other expressions of passion rebelled against her reason, insomuch as a new labour was to be used for her necessary pacification, since she tore her hair, and beat her breast with such violence, as if the delight of the day had been suddenly turned into a dismal night of despair; which continued still working upon her fearful apprehension, until the Prince not onely came again to himself, but appear'd before her eyes, (although something distempered in his looks) absolutely freed in outward shew from all danger: Nevertheless a Coach quickly carrying him accompanied by the rest of the Court to the Dukes Palace, where Physicians being sent for after a while, assured themselves he had received no inward bruise, and therefore the accident less to be regarded: But upon better search they found, that one of the bones in his left arm was displaced, which caused him for some time, to keep both his Chamber and his Bed: And this by consequence not onely deferred his journey into Myssia as was intended, but put off all farther conferences with the Commissioners, about his reception, and entertainment in their Countrey; they not being willing to disturb his rest, either with thoughts or care: 'Tis true this accident seemed as it was imagined, not much displeasing to Arethusius , for that it appeared to be a colour sufficient for his longer stay in the Island of Cyprus , without any blemish to his honour or activity, when as the Gods pleasures and his infirmity might be esteemed the onely causes of the interruption: But whilst affairs remained in this manner, between the hope of his cure; and the Commissioners receiving something out of Myssia , that might moderate the conditions, Dedalus came out of Crete , whither he had been formerly sent by Prince Arethusius to raise Forces, whereby to contend in that Countrey with the Senates power: After two or three dayes of repose, in the presence of Cloria and Narcissus , he gave this accompt of his employment in that unfortunate Island; however something thereof they had heard already by other intelligences. As the Gods, said he, have no doubt a spiteful intention for the ruine of our Nation, (whether occasioned by reason of the barbarous sensualities of the people, or proceeding from some other hidden cause, not revealed to mortality, I shall not need to dispute) so am I perfectly assured on the other side, that those Subjects will neither fight in defence of their own liberties, (although if the enemy totally prevail they are certain to be made the greatest slaves in the world) or trust the Nobility that have engaged thir lives and fortunes in justification of your Rights: This serving for the preamble of my discourse, I shall proceed to let you know more particularly, those passages since my departure from the Island of Cyprus , that have happened in that unfortunate Countrey: Upon my arrival, as I say, in Crete , fortified with your Authority, and enjoyned by your commands, I first summoned the whole generality of the people, to give their appearance on a day prefixt appointed for that purpose: 'Tis true I must confess, many not onely appeared, especially of the better sort, but were ready to give me assistance in what they could, according to their abilities; with this complyance, we presently formed a competent Army for your service, which together with other interests, I used of my own friends, that upon my score revolted from the enemy, we soon made our selves masters of the best part of the Countrey: This happy success (all the chief Towns in a maner yielding to your obedience) made us not onely seek out our adversaries, wheresoever we could finde them, but instantly besieged the City of Pergame , and another Haven Town at some distance; but by reason of this design, we were constrained to divide our Forces, which as yet we could not very well spare from the main body of the Army, wanting materials, and not being assured of all: In the interim, the old Natives, jealous of every thing, but their own goodness, being malicious against any authority, that spoke not to their imaginations, the rude ridiculous customs of their pretended antiquity, began a Treaty under and with the Senate of Lydia , hoping thereby to gain benefit; however they became by their subtlety and craft, (our Nation being not wise enough for preventions, though alwayes suspicious of those persons that have the rightest meaning) so undermined that building upon their promises, and possessed with an opinion of their own safety, instead of assisting, or at least giving your affairs a free passage, they fell upon part of our Army unexpected with all their Forces; insomuch as we were not onely constrained presently, to quit the places again to the enemies power, but in the way were so scattered and disordered, that we could not possible arrive at the City of Pergame , where our other Army lay: After this overthrow, (and thereby hindred to re-inforce the Siege before the Town) the Garrison perceiving our disadvantages, and encouraged with certain reports of new supplies comming out of Lydia , of a sudden when we least looked for the attempt, (since they had lain so long without doing of any memorable thing of that nature) set upon our Trenches, with a most prevailing violence: Truly I should be glad here to make an end of my relation, but that I know your Royal expectation, doth otherwise command my duty, although it be to my own loss, and my Countreys shame; wherefore I shall beg leave onely to tell you, that as we were assaulted with greater fury, then could well be imagined from those people, that had been a long space shut up between their walls and fortifications, without attempting any thing worth the least consideration, so did the success prove contrary to all belief, concerning our particulars: For what by the cowardliness, or treason of some of our own Soldiers, rather Natives by Birth, then careful of their Liberties? Or whether the immortal Gods were too much displeased, at the general licentiousness of our Army; and therefore brought a kinde of a destroying fate and fear amongst us: Scarce was the Alarum given, but we sacrificed both our lives and honour, to that present success of the enemy; insomuch instantly raising our Camp, as the other Town had done before, we were compelled to retire at so far a distance, that Hercrombrotus the Senate General, being then upon the Seas, with a gallant and well provided Army, brought out of Lydia , had liberty, not onely freely to land his Forces, but became in this manner in possession of so much of Countrey as served him conveniently, to quarter his Souldiers, until he could fit them entirely for a March upon new designs; all which as I may say, was effected by the means of an unprovident inconstancy of those old Native Cretans , being entertained and deluded by the Lydian Promises, that never was intended should be performed: For if we had speedily taken the first Town besieged, which had not been hindred without their interposition, those supplies without doubt, would quickly have made us possessors of Pergame ; and so by consequence, Hercrombrotus could never have put his Souldiers in any considerable posture, whereby to have prevailed to our disadvantage, without being cut off upon every occasion, by small parties of our Forces: With these words Dedalus would have held his peace, but the company desiring to be better satisfied, of the farther proceedings of Hercrombrotus , he again re-assumed his discourse. After that Hercrombrotus had, as I said, conveniently refeshed his Army for a march, and a farther progress into the Countrey, he came and sate down before a strong Haven Town, not very many furlongs from the City of Pergame ; which place as I had lately taken out of the enemies hands by assault, so had I furnished the same with a competent Garrison of my best Souldiers; nevertheless, I mixed them also with many of the Natives, whom I esteemed would be most careful of their liberties; designing over them a Commander, whose valour, conduct, and experience, could scarce be parallel'd in other Nations: When Hercrombrotus had lain some weeks before the Fort, with small or no advancement at all in his affairs, he resolved to give a general attempt upon the walls, as his last refuge and expectation; wherefore after a short speech, (first having encouraged the Souldiers to the enterprize, letting them see the inconveniency that would follow, if their enemies should prevent them in the very infancy of their endeavours, and of the contrary the profits that would arise to the Senate of Lydia by the success) with a bold courage himself in person, went before his Troops to the assaulting the Bulwarks: But however he thus encouraged all, and threatned some, whom he conceived most backward in their valours, yet twice were they beaten from the walls by the inhabitants, with extraordinary slaughters; so that Hercrombrotus being extreamly enraged with this affront, as doubting this opposition, if not cured in time, either by courage or policy; might prove a desperate prejudice to his designs, furiously taking a spear in his hand, by that act obraiding their cowardliness, with his own seeming intention of resolution, began again in that posture, to march towards the Town; vowing he would either sacrifice his life, as a testimony of his Armies dishonour, or carry the place for his Countreys advantage: Whether this action or no, animated the Souldiers to a higher expression of courage? Or whether the destinies had put an absolute period in their hidden decrees, concerning all the future prosperity of the Cretan Nation? Upon this third and last assault, they entred part of the walls: In the interim, this unexpected and much more then unlookt for success that followed it, put the Inhabitants into an extraordinary confusion and amazement; insomuch, as notwithstanding the brave and resolute deportment of the Governour, who endeavoured by all wayes possible again, to recollect the fearful and dismaying spirits of the Souldiers of the Garrison, whereby to make some head and resistance, against the prosperous enterprize of the prevailing enemy, yet those many old Natives that were in the Town, (which in truth comprehended the greater number) chose rather to yield to the mercy of their half conquerours, then any longer fight, whereby to maintain your right, or their own possessions; so that after the Town was taken, the Souldiers being all disarmed, the next day with their Captain, they were brought into the Market place, there to expect a farther sentence, either of life or death, according to the will and pleasure of the Lydian power: The conclusion was onely this, when they expected some lenity, or rather a forbearance of the worst cruelty, in an instant, I may say, the Command was given to put them all to the Sword: The horrid spectacle that then appeared to the view of the people, after that the Souldiers of the Garrison were in this manner slaughtered, reserved their deserving Commander, in the last place for the uttermost period of misfortune and pitty, being in the end made also a sacrifice to their spleen; however with a little more circumstance and decorum then the rest: This being performed, the Towns plunder and many of the Inhabitants lives followed of both Sexes, to make up this doleful Catastrophe compleat, and perfect in every kinde and nature, that could be esteemed almost strange and unexampled: And yet I shall adde one short story, though but performed in the persons of some few, that may serve for an example to future ages: There was near the place, a certain gallant habitation, not yet totally destroyed by the violence of this war, from whence as it should seem, all the ancient and noble Family, for fear of the present danger were fled; notwithstanding by chance, there was left behinde one little childe, who appeared of so sweet an aspect, that by reason thereof he might have challenged all security and protection: This Boy comming out from amongst the woods, that there belike for some time had lain hid, he was presently seized by one of the Officers of the Army, no doubt with an intention to preserve him from ruine: Nevertheless two or three of the common Souldiers, grown insolent by reason of their prosperity, and being hardened in cruelty with overmuch blood that they had shed, not onely in a peremptory way demanded of him that led the childe, whether or no he intended to conserve the life of that youth, (who in after times might be a means to revenge their Parents quarrel to their destruction) but with these very words, struck out the brains of the childe, with those weapons they carried in their hands, as well to the pity, as the amazement of their own Officers? Whether or no these persons were punished for this inhumane fact I cannot say? But upon these advertisements, I sent a messenger to the chief Commander of the old Natives, lying then with his Army, some distance from the Town; not onely to let him know all these particulars, in which as I said, consisted the ruine of their Countrey, and the intended extirpation of the Nation, but desired his whole company, as well for the love of their own honours, as in regard of the right and title of their King, they would think upon some uniting way, that might procure a speedy resistance to the over-prevailing enemy; whose prosperity (as themselves were thus disjoyned) could but but presage a destruction to both our endeavours. The answer he sent me was onely this; that as he hoped the Gods would protect their Countrey and Religion to all eternity; so was he unwilling to joyn with those persons, that had an intention in their hearts to love neither, which the seeming enemy now in prosperity, could but effect at the worst, by a destruction to the whole in the general; however his thoughts had a confidence, no power should be able to compass it from the Gods permission; and therefore if I tendred so much the service of my King, I might go on in my wayes apart, whilst he would defend himself and his own Army as well as he could either from slaughter or Treason. O you Gods, Sir, said Dedalus , with what reluctancy did I beat this harsh unsatisfying reply from that rude and ill nurtur'd General? Sometimes my passions, would have challenged him to a single combat, for his want of fidelity shewed as I conceived in your service; but I considered the act might have tasted more of rashness then of benefit, although the offer should have been willingly entertained: Other whiles I thought to have fought with his whole Forces, and by that means perchance compell him to a ready complyance; which also seemed after a while to my apprehension, to be of a dangerous consequence, since the issue must needs have weakened both sides, to the onely advantage of the Lydians . To be short, Sir, things remaining in this posture, when Hercrombrotus had sufficiently both refreshed and encouraged his Army, towards prosecution of new designs, he marched farther into the Countrey, against another chief Town of ours, wherein was a Garrison of Souldiers, composed as well of the Natives as of Lydians ; but however they lay before it many weeks without prevailing (in the interim our Forces lying scattered about the Island, more tending to suspitions and divisions amongst our selves, then endeavouring to give assistance to the place) he at last, rather by stratagem then force, also entered this unfortunate City, where again were performed such acts of Hostility, as I shall not need to call cruelties in some high measure; for as the Souldiers spared neither sexes nor ages, so did they with a kinde of deriding violence, put to death all the Priests, as they stood at the Altars, sacrificing to the Gods; especially if they were known to be Natives of the Island of Crete , or any way addicted to the opinions of the Temple of Delphos , as being the most hateful distinction they could possibly use, whereby to encourage the Army, with hopes to be possessors of their Lands and Estates: I must confess, I thought that the newness of these slaughters, would have animated both the people of the Countrey, and the General in particular of the old Cretans , (who seemed to pretend to stand for their Rights and Religion) to some complyance with our Forces: To which purpose, I sent again to that ancient, though obstinate Commander, as well to lay before his consideration, the intentions of the enemy, as the danger to the whole body of the people, if some more speedy agreement were not made, to stop this furious torrent, that presaged the destruction of all their lives and liberties, belonging rather as I said to them then to us, when as the enemy already, had demonstrated such marks of spite and indignity, to those that were onely addicted to their belief; he sent me word again, that as he had confidence enough yet left him, to be able to defend his own company, as well in regard of their valour as affection, against what power soever, so was he resolved, to hazzard all the desperate adventures could be imagined, rather then subject his Souldiers under the Command of any General, that did not punctually in every point agree with the worship of the Gods, according to their ancient Countrey manner; since they had as he said, in their Army a messenger from the Arch-Flamin of Delphos , who had sufficiently instructed them in their duty to that purpose, and whose affection to the Island they had abundantly tried: I shall not need to relate any more concerning the spirit of these men, that caused these jealousies and suspitions amongst us; rather putting their confidence (as I have been certainly informed) in those promises they had received from the Senate, notwithstanding they found effects alwayes clean contrary to their expectation, then in your right and titles, accompanied by those advantageable conditions, divers times offered by my self to their consideration and acceptance; other passages of the same and several other natures, might be added to this discourse, but that I shall no longer trouble your Highness, with the particulars of all our misfortunes, if I may not call them more properly treasons, acted in that Island against your right and dignity; though rather perhaps contracted, by the foolish ambitions of that sensual and inconstant people, who cannot be brought from believing the old and feigned stories of their commanders, then by reason of any malice ingrafted in their natures towards your particular; onely I must let you know, the better to discharge my duty in your Royal opinion, (which hath been my uttermost labour to conserve) that finding in a manner all the Countrey averse to my farther employment, and being denied personal enterance into many Garrison Towns, yet left unconquered by the enemy, giving up my Commission, to those I esteemed best addicted to your Interest, I resolved entirely to leave the place: which being effected, I retired to a private friends house of my own, whereby the more conveniently to be transported over the seas again into Cyrus , with these relations: Nevertheless during my necessary abode, I understood that Hercrombrotus in a set Battle, had not onely overthrown the old Natives and their General, who pretended after my departure, they would encounter him with success, but had put the most part of these unwise people to the sword, which I must confess, I esteemed a just judgement, sent by the immortal Gods upon their condition, for those many aspersions they had unworthily cast at my proceedings, in the defence of their own disloyalties, and want of courage; not onely at the first in entring into a certain league with the Senates Forces, whereby your service became absolutely obstructed, as afterward in refusing to joyn with me upon any terms: This I say, must make up the sad Catastrophe of all I can relate, concerning the Transactions of the Island at present, until you may be again informed, what better fortunes shall betide your other Commanders left, to prosecute the remaining affairs that belong to your Interest. After that Dedalus had made an end of his discourse, Arethusius with a certain kinde of quiet though inward passion, that might have befitted a Prince of the most gravest temper, casting his eyes first upon Cloria and Narcissus , and then lifting them up towards the skies, uttered these words: Is it possible, O you spiteful destinies, said he, that your malice doth not yet cease, from persecuting the posterity of glorious Euarchus , whose blood I had thought, had already pacified all the rage of the infernal furies: No no, the Gods as it should seem, are as unmindefull of that memorable sacrifice (since they continue still the mischief) as men living upon the earth, are ungrateful to so good a Prince, who else would have endeavoured either a revenge for his loss, or some reparations by being truer to those, that in all right and justice, ought to succeed him in his possessions, though not in his fame; but Narcissus and his Sister, quickly stopt the current of his now stirred up passions, by leading him presently into another room. The relations of Dedalus , concerniug these unfortunate passages of the Island of Crete , were soon dispersed over all the Court, and so by consequence, not long kept from the knowledge of the Commissioners of Myssia , who however were so far from commiserating the condition of that Countrey, having likewise received new intelligence from their own Kingdom of the success, and finding that young Arethusius could probably now, relye upon no other assistance, began rather to heighten in their already propounded Articles of agreement, then shewed any inclination, to become more milde and temperate in their acceptance and execution: These Troubles so much afflicted the thoughts of the Prince, and his vertuous Sister, that scarce did they give entertainment for some dayes, to their nearest friends and acquaintance, although Narcissus the Duke used his best endeavours to qualifie those passions in them both: Sometimes he put them in hope of the integrity of the Myssian Nation, notwithstanding the seeming rigidness of their carriage and demeanour, with the assurance likewise, that Argylius would be most serviceable in the expedition intended, when as he should be throughly perswaded, there was both trust and confidence to be had in their Princes actions, those former jealousies being absolutely banished from the apprehension of all the Royal Family, which could not better, as he said, be demonstrated, then by performing quickly that journey, that was not onely desired, but designed by the whole Nobility of the Kingdom of Myssia in the general, and most of all by himself in particular, according to those often protestations, he had made both to Meliander and the Commissioners: Then again be assured Arethusius , that in his absence, he would continually labour the Syrian State, whose creatures the Myssians were, to supply his occasions as necessity should require, according to the promises made by Andromida to Hyacinthia the Queen his Mother, upon his leaving of the great City of Damascus: Besides he would not be wanting as he said, with his own people, to procure both shipping and Arms, with other provisions, towards the better furnishing of those Souldiers, that should be employed in the wars, which was intended against the Senate of Lydia , to revenge Euarchus death, and to restore the Rights of Succession to his posterity, with many other assistances of divers natures, whereby more fully to encourage the thoughts of young Arethusius to a necessary belief, that his journey would be luckily and prosperous, without which it had been unpossible, to have wrought his disposition to a sufficient confidence of the Myssians actions and intention, since many had engrafted in his apprehension despairing fancies, concerning that Nations want of fidelity to his service; as it was thought onely, because themselves were not permitted to attend him in the voyage. These and such like perswasions at last, not onely brought Arethusius to a positive resolution, of putting his person and fortunes into the Myssians hands, (since in truth there appeared no other hopes at the present, for that the affairs of Crete seemed in a manner to be destroyed, or at the best remaining in a most desperate condition) but also prefixed a certain season for his taking the Seas to that purpose; at which time all the Altars and Temples of Cyprus smoaked with incense by the commandment of the Duke for the prosperity and good success of the Princes journey: So that the day comming for his departure, in the interim being accompanied by his sweet Sister, though with many gentle tears appearing in her fair eyes, he was conducted to his ships lying on the shore; long it was notwithstanding, before he would take his last leave of Cloria , endeavouring a while as it were to smother her with his passionate though most chaste kisses: Neither was he yet left by his kinde and loving Brother Narcissus , who according to the custom, would not quit his company, until he saw the gallant Vessels under sail, and then taking a small Boat for his own transportation back again, he committed him to the protection of the great God Neptune , being the onely esteemed patron of the Island of Cyprus . Arethusius after he had failed for many dayes, along the Coasts of the lesser Asia , with a seeming prosperous winde, he with his whole fleet at last arrived at the Isle of Tenedos , which for the present belonged to the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Myssia , not having had in the way any considerable adventures worth the mentioning; only once they were pursued with part of the Lydian Navy: As soon as it was known, that the Prince had there taken up his station, whilst preparation could be made for his farther voyage, Argylius himself not onely gave order for his reception into their chief City Lampsacus , attended by some moderate, or rather accustomed Triumphs, but caused him also to be presented with a rich Chariot for his better transportation to the place, drawn with six beautiful Horses of the Scythian breed: At the Town Argylius met him, accompanied with many of the Nobility of his Faction, amongst whom also were some of the Priests, who had shewed themselves most opposite to the proceedings of King Euarchus his Father, however with such countenances appearing, according to his apprehension, as if they meant to keep yet their own authority, notwithstanding all the complements were used to his person: 'Tis true the salutes of Argylius appeared so humble and satisfactory to the outward view, that every one believed no less then a supream confidence, was to be given both to his fidelity and intention, which did not a little content, and please the opinion of the young Prince, whose disposition was so good and uncorrupted, that he scarce believed the art of dissimulation could be in another, since he found his own thoughts pure without fiction: These seeming correspondences called also to his presence, divers other Priests of the Nation, from almost every part of the Countrey; who not onely before the people prayed continually for their Kings prosperity and success; but also sacrificed in his own view, to the Gods with chearful countenances; however, at the latter end of their Offices, they intimated alwayes, some need of his reformation in many particulars, in regard as they said, he had been from his youth bred up, not onely in the Lydian Rites, but also instructed as they said by the accursed Flamins , in opposition to their doctrine and principles, which had occasioned all the difference between his Father and themselves, as well to his own ruine, as his Kingdoms disquiet: So that an Oath was required from his particular, to assure the Nation, both of his sorrow for what was past, concerning the actions of King Euarchus , and his own amendment in the time to come, belonging to the things desired; without which conditions, he could not be admitted as they affirmed, to the Government in the Countrey of Myssia . Notwithstanding a day was appointed for the Coronation of Arethusius , yet were his noble and youthful thoughts, more then troubled at these restrictions; but being perswaded by some friends to an absolute complyance, rather then distract business, when they were already brought to this issue in the opinion of the people, who might else fall off from his assistance as they alledged, by the perswasion of their Priests, that watched nothing but occasions for their own advantage, he was content at last to yield fully to their propositions, although the consideration of his honour, oftentimes invited him to a new breach: when the time came for the Inauguration of the young King, whose person and looks merited more reall possessions, then bare titles of so barren and factious a Countrey; Argylius seemed the readiest of any other, to set the Crown upon his youthful Brows: Many notwithstanding noting his extraordinary diligence in that service, and knowing of old his unlimited covetousness and ambition, could not but inwardly smile, either at his conversion or hypocrisie; some accounted him a very Fox, habited in sheeps clothing; others again imagined him to carry the poyson of Aspes , under the fluentness of his professions; a third sort thought, he was meerly compelled to this seeming compliance, by the onely fear of being too much suspected by the common people, who had been so long a time deluded by the main strength of his dissimulation, joyned together with the power of the Priests of the Nation, that had for many years wound themselves insensibly into the hearts of the multitude; being delighted rather with the strange and wonderful stories they told them, then with the soundness of their doctrine and reason; yet there was not a few, that believed charitably of the intentions of Argylius in the future, in seeing now a brave young man, being the right heir of the Kingdom, to become the possessor of that by his means, which he could not well hold from him any longer, but by the force of oppression and hazard; which at last might fall heavy, both upon him and his posterity. But whatsoever were his thoughts and practices, yet the vigilant Senate of Lydia , having quick intelligence of all these proceedings, and knowing how dangerous a consequence it would be, to have the eldest Son of Euarchus , whom they had put to death, to be admitted peaceably to the possession of the Kingdom of Myssia , that could not as they supposed in time to come, but revenge his Fathers injuries, if his power should any way be made equal with his will, dispatched speedily messengers to their General Hercrombrotus , then prosecuting their affairs in the Island of Crete ; not onely to wish him to make haste into Lydia , but also to bring with him, what forces he could conveniently spare, from those employments he had in hand, whereby the better to put a stop to those threatning dangers, that seemed to be ominous to the Senates safety; since as they said, the Myssian Nation had resolved, not onely to have a King, contrary to the present constitution of Lydia , but also to make choice of no other then that person they most hated and feared of all the world. Whilst the triumphs and entertainments continued in the City of Lampsacus , as well to shew forth the Myssian glory, as to make their new King believe, how much they intended his honour, whereby to render his thoughts less suspitious of their actions; for that they meant he should onely rule according to their impressions, their great Councel became suddenly saluted, with a Message from the Senate of Lydia , in this manner: In regard they perceived the Myssians want of fidelity, concerning the unity and correspondency promised between both Countreys, in the beginning of the wars with Euarchus , by chusing themselves a King without their approbation, it was now full time to look to their own preservation, when as the Son of the chief enemy to the people of each Nation, was at present dignified with the supreamest title; so that unless they would again depose him from that Royalty, and begin a new agreement with themselves, they did assure the people, they would soon visit their habitations with such an Army, as should not be resisted by all the strengths and endeavours of the Myssian Nation: This peremptory demand, was quickly brought to be argued before the Supream Assembly of the whole Kingdom; many would have had the insolent messenger, sent back to Sardis with nothing but marks of disgrace, instead of any satisfaction or expostulation; in that his masters seemed, as they said, so far to derogate from the honour of their Countrey, as not to be willing to allow the people a liberty, to elect a King without their permission, or would so much as afford the Nation in their thoughts, competent courages and power, to be able to contend for their own rights and priviledges; others again were less furious,  & thought it best to have the messenger at leastwise satisfied with fair words, and good entertainment, which hindred not the Myssians as they said, to stand upon their rights, and prosecute their own determinations; but Argylius , whose covetous disposition had made him in a maner a slave to the fear of any disturbance, either by arms or other contentions, was of opinion not only to use their messenger, with all possible honour and respect but even to study to the uttermost of their power, a continuance of friendship with the Lydian people, and thereupon by consequence to assure them in their answer, that as they had no intention at all to invade, or make War with their neighbouring Countrey, upon what title or pretence soever, so would they (however it was not to be disputed, but that it was an indubitable right to have a King of their own chusing in Myssia ) desire their Prince to confirm every agreement between both Nations, before he took upon him, the Government of the Kingdom. O Gods, with what indignation, did Prince Arethusius resent this base and unworthy motion, when as the chief intention, and hopes of his journey into Myssia , was onely to have by that means, a better conveniency to revenge his Fathers death; for that he esteemed not the Countries Government, worth his youthful imployment: But whilst businesses were in these disputes, which had like to have kindled new flames amongst the Myssians themselves, Hercrombrotus , (whether enraged by his own spleen, in regard that dissembling Lycius and Argylius , as he might imagine, had not faithfully enough kept those compacts, made between them at his last being in their Countrey; or whether or no he was anew invited into Myssia by that faction, whereby the better to obstruct these passages, that tended to the more absolute establishment of Prince Arethusius , in all his Fathers possessions, and total hereditory power and authority; by which means in time, neither Argylius or the turbulent Priests, would be of any esteem, or reputation with the common people,) of a sudden appeared not many dayes journey from the very walls of the City of Lampsacus , with a most terrible and gallant prepared Army; whereby as he said, to ask an account of their late proceedings, as well for the election of their new King, contrary to former promises, as concerning some other things more privately to be disputed, when the Sword and the fortune of the Wars, had decided the quarrel between the two Nations: however the whole Countrey of Myssia , and chiefly the City of Lampsacus were extreamly amazed, at this sudden surprize and invasion of Hercrombrotus , with the Lydian Army, yet Arethusius appeared inwardly glad in his minde, not onely for that he thought, he should have the better occasion thereby, to demonstrate to the world his own youthful courage, which for a long season he had wanted in his desires, but also in that he supposed, by this attempt of the Senate, all means of reconciliation of both Nations, would be absolutely taken away from those enemies of his, that laboured most in the business to his prejudice underhand: wherefore to this purpose, at the next assembly of the great Councel of the Kingdom, he required speedily to be furnished with some Troops of Horse, as well to give a taste to the people of his own intended valour, as he said, in his Countries cause, as also thereby, to have the opportunity in part, to revenge his Fathers death. Argylius after he had with a certain kinde of sober and formal gravity, attended to the full period of the young Princes desires, began in express terms, to oppose his intentions with these words: As it doth not appear as yet, said he, that our young King hath sufficiently given testimony, either of his affection or integrity towards the cause, and the Gods Worship in so absolute a way, as is necessary to satisfie the peoples expectation; so according to my opinion, it is not fit to trust the safety of his person, in the first conflict with the enemy, but rather recommend the whole care thereof, to our old experienced Captain and General Lycius , who best knows, both how to conduct an Army, and when to fight for the Countreyes advantage: It was scarce to be imagined, with what an enraged apprehension, accompanied with no small amazement, did Prince Arethusius entertain this unexpected contradiction, from the false-hearted (and as he thought) traiterous Argylius: Sometime his youthful choller stirred up his natural courage, to revenge his conceived insolency presently before the assembly: yet at last his discretion tempered his passions, hoping the Councel it self would act that piece of justice for him; but finding them for the most part rather inclinable to the motion, than to do him right in that particular, he uttered this language: If our Countrey Gods had an intention, said he, to defend our Nation from ruine and slavery, it were impossible that cowards and traytors, could have such power and prerogative in your thoughts, as to suffer my honour, and your good to be thus captivated, onely by the underhand combinations of a few, that have apparently sold your liberties, to buy their own covetous and ambitious ends, which perhaps you will sufficiently perceive, when all is lost, or gone from your possession: With these words he presently turned his back; and retired half distracted with his own choller to his lodgings. When he came into his Chamber, accompanied by Meliander and some few other of his most trusted servants: You Gods he cryed out, what injuries suffer you to be done to the right and honour of Princes, when cowardly traytors are permitted in this manner, to prevail in greatest and wisest assemblies: Have I been won said be, from the company of my sweet Sister in the Island of Cyprus , whereat leastwise I enjoyed security and respect, to transport my self into a barbarous Countrey, where remains nothing but multitudes of infernal creatures, that onely with false pretensions and poisonous language, seek to betray that little content which was left me, in regard of my yet unblemished reputation; spightfully conferring upon me onely a few vain titles, instead of those essential realities promised before this unlucky journey was undertaken? No, no said he, 'tis proud and ambitious Argylius that wears the Myssian diadem, and not Prince Arethusius the true heir of Euarchus , whilst his false instrument Lycius , hath more than opportunity given him, to betray as he pleaseth all the Nobility of this unfortunate Countrey; then casting his eyes upon Meliander that attended next to his person: You see said he, to what a pass your perswasion hath brought my affairs, when instead of being King to a noble and faithful Nation, with an honour and command, equal to my title and birth, I must not be allowed so much as the priviledge, of being a simple Captain in their Army: Accursed be the time I say, when deluded by many expectations, I first set sail from the gallant Haven of Salamine , where nature at least afforded me a liberty (though no jurisdiction) in the love and security of my friends, which was a content compared with this captivity, not to be lost with toil, pains, and hazzard. Meliander finding that the Prince, betrayed his secret thoughts, to the knowledge of his hidden enemies; by his passionate expressions; or perhaps would be a means, to make any become so, that as yet were otherwise resolved in their determinations, rather than gained any necessary consolation to his inward grief, by little and little without either expostulation or answer, drew him into a more retired place for conference; where after he had with some reasons, endeavoured to settle his temper, to a convenient pacification for audience and consideration, he thus spoke unto him. Sir said he, as it becomes not a Prince to seem dejected by any accidents, so ought you to be perswaded, that intemperate passions, are of nearest neighbourhood to such expressions: Besides you must consider, that in the open devulging of any distastes, or intention of revenge against what persons soever; before you have those enemies in your power, serve but to strengthen them and weaken your self, in arming those people by a forewarning admonition, of what they shall expect, when opportunity complies with your desire; for if again in your minde, you should chance to change your determination, by reason of other informations; or themselves could be contented to be converted in their hearts towards your service, scarce would the causes of their former suspicions, be taken away from their thoughts and apprehension, whereby to suffer you alwayes to live in safety by their permission; and how easily the effects of either hatred or fear, may be put in execution in Myssia , not onely your own reason may guide you to conceive, when as you are scarcely yet admitted to be King, but also the many examples, that of the same nature have preceded these times, are sufficient instructions without farther delating upon the Text: 'Tis true, I cannot deny, but I was one of the first that invited you to this journey (a crime if it were one, proceeding onely from my integrity) yet withal you may be pleased to consider, that that very Councel was also accompanied with the thoughts and opinion of brave Narcissus Duke of Cyprus , whose fidelity to your particular, is no more to be suspected, then his wisdome to be doubted in the general; in that no small injury would have been done to your youth, if you should have let slip an opportunity offered, whereby not onely to become the revenger of your Fathers death, but to be the possessour of your own Kingdoms; for that the world would have believed, and your enemies given out every where to your dishonour, that you wanted a competent courage for action; especially you being destituted of all other means, by the unhappy differences continuing between the Syrian and Egyptian States, in which quarrel as you know, all other Princes almost in Asia are involved: So that Sir, rather then entertain these unprofitable (if not dangerous mutinies in your minde, observe I beseech you the wise maximes of your Grandfather, who thereby overcame all his difficulties, and at the end reigned most gloriously, according to his own will and pleasure in Lydia ; which was to let none see his spleen, but every one his pleasant countenance: I must tell you, however he was contradicted for some time by the Nobility, contemned in like manner by his Subjects; and last of all imprisoned by the Priests, yet by yielding much in many particulars, he in the length got all to his own possession; not onely in the barren Mountains of the Myssian Territory, but even in the fruitful plains of the Lydian Kingdom as I said, in which posture he left his Dominions to your most vertuous Father, who certainly might have better prospered in his affairs, if too many of his enemies had not been made acquainted with his expressions; whereby oftentimes was noted either his love, or hatred to his own prejudice: for dissimulation is as necessary in Princes actions, as the Sword of Justice to be drawn when there is occasion; since the one doth but better try and examine the vertue or guilt of men, as the other doth give them their rewards or punishment, according to their deserts: In conclusion I can say nor think no more; if Lycius get the day against the Lydians in this National quarrel, your Honour and Government must needs be the better established, for that it is unpossible alwayes to live both a King, and a Captive amongst the people; and if he lose the victory, it will be imputed either to his want of valour or fidelity, by which means, you will come to new possessions of power, having already offered your person to dangers freely in your Countries cause; besides continue such a suspicion upon your enemies actions and intentions, as necessarily must make them and their faction, become entirely hateful to the people, by whose onely power they hitherunto have opposed all your designs. After that Arethusius had studied a while, he made this reply; As I will not disparage the capacity said he of my Grandfather, of governing and complying with the Myssian people, in his necessities and oppressions, believing that he brought about many things meerly by his extraordinary art in dissimulation, so must you know also (as I have been informed) he lost a great deal of reputation with Forreign States and Kingdoms, in not declaring upon occasion a competent courage, both when his Mother suffered by meer oppression in Lydia , and himself was imprisoned by the insolent Priests of this Nation: for a seeming fear, or want of valour in a Prince (whose thoughts should alwayes be heroical, and full of magnanimity) is a miserable unhappiness, and dishonour to his fame and future memory; which is the chiefest benefit left to posterity in after ages: for sensual and present contentments, belonging to ease and security, are properties rather appertaining to unreasonable creatures, than to those who ought to be endued with great and immortal souls, fit for dominion, rule, and example; so that he that shall not desire to dye once, rather than be disesteemed ever shall dye often and live never: Truly I must compare my Fathers industry, pains, and suffering, not onely to my Grandfathers policy, but with all the Kings that have been before him in Lydia , who never wanted a sufficient courage to contend to the uttermost with his powerfullest enemies or lacked any fortitude, when he found himself overcome by fortune, to sustain gallantly his greatest crosses and oppressions, though a certain kinde of heavenly fate, denyed him both prosperity and success, which notwithstanding can never lessen his fame to all eternity: I must tell you Meliander said he, that craft is but an unprofitable, and tyrannical master to fear, and both together can but maintain any condition for a while, when as courage and wisdome (the two opposites) will probably continue a Prince happy, either in honour or fortune for lasting ages, if not alwayes in himself to be enjoyed, yet to his successours; which latter although my Father wanted, yet the other certainly he possest; since his Father strived by a certain kinde of timorous subtilty, but to defend his Government from invasion during his own life, rather by pleasing than acting, and complying than contradicting; whereas the other was forced to become altogether distasteful to the people, in seeking to uphold that right to his Crown for posterity, which his predecessor had so much neglected; onely to procure a little ease for a time to his person, taking pleasure in his ordinary imployments, as if he shunned all pains to his body, or trouble to his minde; and to this purpose never denyed any that asked him a benefit, or punished those that intended him most mischief; at leastwise dissembled his choller and dislike towards his worst enemies. 'Tis true, replyed Meliander , that King Euarchus Father, and your Grandfather, was not altogether free from these imperfections, which for the most part notwithstanding were attributed to him, rather as effects of his good nature, than defects arising from his sensuality; so willing was the world, to make use of the benefits they received, either by his mercy, or from his liberality; however I must not deny also, but in all accidents of Government, natural means ought to be used for prosperous issues, and by consequence neither a fitting compliance to be neglected when there is occasion, or a reserved secresie to be preserved alwayes in a Princes bosom: for sometime we must dissemble towards people, or to enemies both at home and abroad: I cannot deny it, replyed Arethusius , so it be done notwithstanding with that vertue, and magnanimity of soul, befitting a Princes condition, whereby his honour may neither be blasted in the future, or his courage be suspected in the present; for all the actions of Princes, should be looked upon as benefits to their people, concerning their peaceable Government; or as examples to posterity, to do the like for the more honour of themselves; which can never be procured by a timerous kinde of trembling in all our actions: for how is it possible other States can fear to offend us abroad, if they finde our natures apt to be terrified at home? In that for the most part, our safety shall still become more beholding to our neighbours want of power and opportunity, than to our own courage and industry, if we be not invaded in our rights; since they will not suppose our fortitude will oppose, whensoever they shall have a desire, or convenient means to attempt: Besides, fame is the life and being of a Prince, and that cannot be ruled and governed either by the appetites, or the power of others, but by those demonstrations, that must make us appear as we ought to be, Gods upon earth, never to be terrified, or disobeyed; in which posture, our graces shall still seem benefits and not dues. I must confess Sir, said Meliander , that these are most glorious attributes, fit to adorn a Princes dignity; but how they can be well attained, without a politick comportment in difficulties, I know not, since a flourishing prosperity in fortune is not alwayes to be expected; especially being in a manner out of possession as you are for for the present; wherefore necessary to get entrance by friendship or the Sword, against those multitudes of factions now reigning in both Kingdoms: But Sir, to avoid many other disputes, I beseech you to let me know, what you call that vertue so much to be esteemed, which ought not to be wanting in a Prince, though for it he lose both life and dominion? I call nothing said Arethusius vertue, that is mixed any way, either with dissimulation, or indirect dealing, which as I intimated before, argues fear and not courage; so that I would have a Prince alwayes to prosecute his designs although with secresie, yet without hypocrisie; as not laughing in his enemies face, whilst he hath an intention to destroy his person; but rather plainly to let him understand his crimes, that he may either confess his fault, or be thought at leastwise to deserve punishment, who else cannot but continue, if not glory in his own wickedness, since he will think he is not perceived; or which is worse, too much feared, to be discovered by any power; and so consequently shall instead of repentance be incouraged in vice, bringing a kinde of appetite more dangerous upon the world, by reason of the example, when people shall finde that rather benefit than punishment depends on the issue; this connivancy I say becomes not a Prince in any sort to suffer, much less to practice in his own person, if he intend to purchase by his vertue an eternal fame to continue in after ages. Truly Sir in my opinion replyed Meliander , it is unpossible for any mortal dignity, to light upon this even calm in prosperity, without sometimes hiding his thoughts from others; since else traitors would too well be provided against surprizes, who often have those advantages by fortune, that unless their actions be dissembled, circumstances shall be waiting, that must bring them to condign punishment: As for example, when men are to be apprehended, accused, and detected, it ought to be to the satisfaction of others, left what is just in it self appear but meer suspicions to the multitude, and so by consequence will be thought to be rather acts of rashness and tyranny, then indifferency governed by reason; which often may draw on more ill characters towards a Prince, then gain him th e fame coveted to posterity; which I suppose the King your Grandfather rather aimed at, than determined to be alwayes a sufferer, in regard of his seeming sloth and pusilanimity; and to this purpose gave benefits sometimes where he did not love, to make his enemies think they were still in his favour, when perhaps he intended them his worst revenge; which policy, I must say was wanting in your Father, by reason whereof came all his disturbances; since he discovered too much his affections, when he could not punish, and too little punished, when he had occasion; it being much better not to take notice at all, then after knowledge to be remiss in the prosecution; for however your Grandfather seldome revenged, yet he scarce ever took outwardly offence in any desperate manner, which made him continue in peace and prosperity during his life. But Meliander said Arethusius , not too much to detract in appearance, from my Grandfathers wisdome and judgement, or rather may I call it fortune in governing, you may also remember, that notwithstanding he overcame by his extraordinary compliance, some difficulties in this Countrey of Myssia , and by that means as it was thought reigned prosperously during his life, yet no doubt but much thereof, rather ought to be attributed to accident, then to any providence or foresight, since the rich booties which your Countreymen expected from his careless bounty, being possessed of the vast revenues of the old Queen of Lydia , whom he succeeded in the Kingdom, onely kept both their thoughts and actions in some order, until they found those expectations frustrated, by the more sparing hand of my Father, who was not able to contribute so largely to their greedy and covetous dispositions, in regard that all the treasure was already spent by themselves, as also for that his own charge daily encreased, by reason of his numerous issue, which failing they began the expression of their own natural passions, as it were putting in practice their former intention of rebellion and disturbances, as you know with too much success, both here and in Lydia it self: A thing could not be prevented by any humane industry; for that the matter was wanting to take away the cause, since the Kingdom was no more able to sustain the charge or expences necessary for such bounty; at leastwise the people were not willing, to afford my Father convenient supplies to that purpose, having not otherwise sufficient of his own. I cannot deny said Meliander your reasons: However, methinks a little dissimulation at present to be used, whereby to prevent farther mischiefs, both to your person and affairs, will be neither improvident or dishonourable, the better to discover the false intentions of your enemies, whose natures I fear me, cannot be converted by the consideration of any gratitude, so far as to remember, the benefits formerly received from your predecessours by the whole Nation, both in the general or particular: And therefore since it is in the power of your Subjects to injure your proceedings, if not destroy your designs, ( Argylius being the chief man in authority in this region, and something may be hidden in his breast not yet compassed by his ambition) at leastwise give me leave, a little to play the hypocrite for your advantage; wherein you need bear no other part, then what you shall be pleased your self to take or own. Notwithstanding that Arethusius after this discourse, continued still extreamly discontent, that he had neither power in his own commands to be a King, whereby to govern with more honour, or any liberty was afforded him as a private person, to shew his courage in the defence of the Countrey; yet was he perswaded at last to let Meliander use his wits and discretion as he had desired, in sifting out those secret mysteries, that appertained to his better service. In the interim the General Lycius , not onely with all crafty decorums, used most formally all those outward respects, which were due to his youthful Majesty, but confidently promised the whole Nation, speedy effects of his conduct against Hercrombrotus and the Lydian Army; whilst of the other side, Argylius with a learing eye, and a smiling countenance, seemed inwardly to rejoyce in the victory, he had got over the young Princes intentions in the great assembly, concerning the chusing of his own creature, chief Captain of the Myssian Forces, contrary to the violence of those, that had opposed him and his faction therein. In this posture it may be said things remained, until Hercrombrotus began with his whole Army to march towards the City of Lampsacus: 'Tis true, many attempts were made of either side by youthful courages, whereby to hinder each other is their designs; however as it had been decreed, Prince Arethusius could not be admitted to any encounters in his own person, which not onely made him inwardly storm as often as it came into his minde, at those pretended complements of his enemies, that would not suffer him to venture upon any hazzards of that desperate nature, wherewith to gain a desired estimation amongst the Souldiers; but also kept Meliander from putting himself into imployment, not esteeming the command and jurisdiction of old Lycius , since the King was not to be his onely General; and the rather for that as he thought, he could gain no honour in the service: Of the other side he was willing, that the contrary faction might be disgraced in the miscarriage of the business, if they should any way be put to the worst by the Lydian Forces, which he thought not improbable, in that daily it was perceived, the Myssians rather retired before the Army of Hercrombrotus , than either repulsed them, or kept their own ground in the defence of the Countrey, however it was conceived more proceeding from their own treason, or want of valour, then for lack of numbers or provision: whilst in the end they suffered themselves to become even besieged within the circumference of the City walls, as it were trusting onely to that security, as the last refuge they hoped for from the Gods protection, notwithstanding they had many times hypocritically called to the Heavens for their assistance, belike building in their mindes upon this maxime proceeding from the barrenness of their Countrey; that if they were assaulted by many enemies at once, they could starve them out of their attempts, by those want of provisions necessary to sustain nature; and if but by a few being set upon, they could easily defeat their purposes, by such Forces they could procure; which either at the last made Lycius confident of the success, or his own covetousness assured him, of that recompence he desired at any time, whensoever he should betray the Army to the enemies power, this as appeared by the sequel, was indifferently equal to his thoughts: but during the time, that all mens eyes were upon the determinable fate of these two Generals, neither of both wanting either skill, or provision as was conceived, the one to invade, and the other to defend, Meliander whose solicitous fidelity to the young King, made him also restless and laborious in his considerations; one day by chance walking near a River side, for his more privacy, where the Court then remained, he might perceive unexpectedly a Lady walking in a Grove on the opposed border, being as it should seem part of a jurisdiction belonging to a house of Argylius , not far off the City of Lampsacus: This caused Meliander out of civility to salute her with this manner of language, the water being no great enemy to the conveniency of discourse, although it appeared to be an absolute hinderance of their nearer meeting. Lady said he, as this unkinde and discourteous element, is something envious towards my farther desires, that would willingly be admitted to the honour of your conversation at a nearer distance; so of the other side, give me leave (without offence to your better imployments) to enjoy however, what happiness I can, which is to be a little longer acquainted, with those inward perfections of your person, since my eyes have been already made partakers of your youth and beauty; over great excellencies as I conceive, to be onely known to woods and unreasonable creatures, unless they could be instructed to a humane understanding, and thereby proceed at leastwise to admiration, if not adoration: Truly Sir said she, a little smiling in the interim, as innocency when accompanied but with thoughts coming from that original, cannot altogether be free from society, the heavens for the most part, affording it matter sufficient to work upon, so cannot I but brag, though I hope without ostentation, (the praise being rather to be attributed to my Parents wisdome, and indulgency, than to any capacity of mine) that when I finde my self most divided from people, I then esteem my thoughts least alone: Nevertheless replyed Meliander , although perhaps both your nature and vertuous education, may have rendred you addicted to a solitary conversation, which is, I must confess, a most delightful imployment to the soul, yet considering, that a noble marriage probably must be the period of your desires, that cannot be attained, without the resolution of society in the future, methinks it were convenient beforehand, to enure your self to the practise: Truly replyed the Lady, as I finde not my inclinations as yet given, to put my self upon the trouble of any election at all, especially when there appears no necessity of a choice; so of the other side, as I shall perceive my thoughts, or determinations altered, I may have time enough to study a freer conversation in the world; in the interim, I will content my imployments, onely with those decorums and entertainments, that becometh a retired Virgin: But Sir said she, that you may not too much suspect my intention, or be altogether out of love with my practcie, to let you see I am not over-rigid in my determinations, I can so far dispence with my own solitude at present, as to admit of your company to a nearer distance of communication, if you think my society in any sort worth the enjoying as you pretend: To this purpose if you please, there is tyed to the root of yonder willow tree in the water, a convenient Boat for passage over the River, which for the most part hath been accustomed to carry me to your side, when I had a minde to visit the City of Lampsacus , for my better recreation and delight: The Vessel you may make use of to convey you hither, if you think the trouble as I say, will not prove too great for the purchase, and the rather I must tell you, am I thus free to your particular, for that however I am not at all acquainted with your person, yet by some circumstances I judge you to be one of the train, belonging to our young and new King Arethusius , whose right I cannot but honour in this Countrey, notwithstanding my birth and interest perhaps, (when you shall know them) may make you something suspicious of my affection: Meliander not more wondering at her language, then pleased with the favour, putting off at the instant any farther expostulation, hasted to the place to take possession of the courtesie that was so freely offered him; not doubting upon more discourse, but to be better informed, concerning her person and intentions: When he had passed the water, and again fastned the Boat to another shrub, he addressed himself to her presence, with a kinde of humble respect, made up between the breeding of a Courtier, and a Souldiers resolution, that could have no other information of her quality, but what her appearing youth and beauty, afar off seemed to give to his eyes; although her discourses were to his apprehension so well placed, that they could not but deem her of the best education; and so consequently of some eminent descent, the rather so to be esteemed, for that she lived under the jurisdiction of Argylius: Upon his nearer approach, he found his fancy had been much too short, in the perfections of the party, for now she appeared both to his thoughts and eyes, more like the commanding Goddess of those Woods, then a mortal creature of any mean extraction; her apparel being Nimphs attire, however she had covered her self over that habit, with a vail of black Cypres reaching to the ground, holding a Book in her hand, as if contemplations notwithstanding, were more delightful to her nature, than either beauty or honour: As she was tall of stature, so was she something pale in complexion; her eyes black and lively, with her fair hair of a dark flaxon colour, which by the reflection of the Sun, seemed to shine like the brightest Gold: Meliander had not in this manner made many paces towards her, but she with a chearful though bashful countenance, saluted him with this language, confidently enough delivered, though dressed also discreetly by the modesty of a Virgins behaviour: Sir said she, as I would not have you think that this freedom of my invitation, doth taste too much of boldness or impudence, unbecoming our sexes, so cannot I but hope, that you will the better judge of my affection, by my present demeanour; which I shall the more openly impart unto you, when I shall be made acquainted with your name and condition; since as yet I cannot know you to be any other, then one of the faithful retainers belonging to the King in the general: Meliander imagining that her words and actions, tended to the expression of some love passions; or at leastwise the way to them, returned her this answer: Madam said he, as the honour you have done me at present, cannot easily be parallel'd, much less ever requited, so have you cause to be confident enough of yur own vertues and beauty, whereby to perswade the King, or any other of his followers, to those services that may raise your degree, to the highest titles can be expected in the Kingdom of Myssia : Alas alas, said she, I perceive you absolutely mistake my meaning, since as I know your words are onely intended as complements if not flatteries, for that disparities of this nature are not to be coupled in our persons, to give me leave once more to let you know, which you may be ascertain'd of better before we part, that my breast harbours other thoughts and opinions, of a far nobler making, though less ambitious then it should seem you imagine them to be: Meliander after he had upon these expressions told her his name with his profession; and whilst he was wondering at her intentions, the Lady took him by the hand, and led him to a convenient seat by the water side, whereas it should seem she was accustomed oftentimes, to repose her self in her solitary preambulations; it being covered over head, by the large boughs of a shady tree, which defended it from the violence either of storms or heat: When she had rested a while by reason of many pawses, and some other circumstances expressed as well in her eyes as actions, she began this discourse. Sir said she, you may first know, that as the people of this Countrey from my infancy have given me the name of Joyela , so am I in my extraction descended out of Lydian Parents, being Daughter to the Father of Argylius by a second Wife, and so consequently the half Sister of that unfortunate esteemed enemy to Euarchus Family; whose pride and covetousness, I cannot altogether excuse (and retain my own loyalty to my Prince) yet must I a little beg leave of your goodness, though not of your justice, to make what apology I am able in his behalf, according to those appetites of nature, that have so nearly united us in blood; nevertheless, I shall afterward let you know something more, that may perhaps be of validity to your designs: With these words she wept, out of the apprehension, as it might be thought of her Brothers disloyalties in the Countrey of Myssia , whilst in the interim Meliander seemed to wonder, both at her discourse and her intention, until after a while each of them became settled in a resolution, the one to relate, and the other to hear these passages without interruption. You must understand said Joyela , that my Brother Argylius was in his childehood taken from his Parents, and committed to the tuition of the factious Priests of our Nation, upon the occasion which I shall relate unto you: In the time of the old King Euarchus Father, or rather may I call it during his prosperous Reign, there happened notwithstanding some differences amongst the people of Myssia , in their due and ordinary obedience to his Government; whereupon my Father being esteemed the most powerfullest of all the Nobility, was imployed to quiet those stirs, occasioned by reason of some Islands lying near the Helispont , claim'd by the inhabitants of Crete , to be under the jurisdiction of that Countrey, and so by consequence to belong to other great Lords of that Nation, though our family pretended also some interest to them. 'Tis true, after an unexpenceful War mannaged by my Fathers industry and revenue, he both quieted the troubles, and settled the right, as he thought, both to the Kings honour, and his own advantage; but nevertheless contrary to his expectation, when he thought to have received a reward answerable to his deserts, or at leastwise some satisfaction for his disbursement, having contracted to himself and friends a huge debt, not any way to be born by his Estate, he was if not denyed reparation from the Kings Coffers, yet protracted in his demands, insomuch as not being longer able to continue in his own Countrey, by reason of those obligations, at last he was constrained to seek imployments in forreign parts, under the King of Egypts Armies, meerly for his support and maintenance: To this purpose, he was forced not onely in some sort to change his subjection but his religion, since as he knew otherwise it was unpossible for him to serve that State: Nevertheless he had not long continued in these imployments, before his enemies in our Countrey, procured rather by his greatness than his fault, represented his condition and intentions to the old King, with what deformed shapes they could devise for his disadvantage; insomuch as presently Commissions were sent into those parts, not onely to take my Brother Argylius than an infant, from under his Fathers jurisdiction, and commit his future education to some of the most factious Priests of the Nation (as I have already intimated) but also to seize upon all his Estate, both personal and real, to be detained as was pretended for my Brothers use, against he should come at full age, whereby to be capable of the profits and mannagement thereof; so that by this cruelty, they left my Father and Mother, with all the Children of the second venture, either to live upon nothing at all, or to be maintained out of his stipends, procured him from the Wars of Egypt: In this manner as I may say, my Parents for some years subsisted, so my self with other of his Children (that are since dead or otherwise disposed) received our education, according to the customs of those Countries where we then remained, under the profession of that faith taught and practised in the Temple of Delphos: 'Tis true I might particularly tell you, that some small inheritance hath descended unto me from my Mother, upon which I now subsist, but that not being the scope of my intentions, I shall proceed in my other design for your information, concerning the esteemed disloyalties and treasons of Argylius . Here again the fair eyes of lovely Joyela began to melt into tears, at the remembrance of her Brothers actions, which running down her beautiful cheeks, made Meliander more compassionate the Ladies sorrow, than continue his own hate to Argylius: but there being no time for contemplation, scarce any for a settled grief, without some complements or reply, she assumed to her self this discourse, concerning the life and passages of her Brother. Argylius said she, thus taken in his infancy, by violence from the tuition and protection of his indulgent Father, was presently committed as I said, to the care and education of certain Priests in the Countrey of Myssia , who had been chiefly the occasion by reason of their turbulent complaints, of this unnatural, if not inhumane seperation, pretending, as my Father had both impiously and indiscreetly left the true Worship of the Gods, so was it no more than a supreme justice, to deprive him as well of his Children as his Estate, according to the Laws of the Nation, either made or intended as they said for that purpose: Having my eldest Brother thus in their power, and under their jurisdiction, by the absolute authority of the King, whose nature was apt enough to be terrified, towards any compliance that promised rest and ease to his thoughts, whereby he might the more freely follow his pleasures and contentments, either in hunting or other delights, as his appetite passionately desired, they insensibly began to instruct Argylius in their chief principles and doctrine; which was to hate Kings and observe Heresian commands, as indubitable services and rites belonging to the Worship of the immortal Gods: However to make their perswasion the more plausible to his apprehension, they told him withal, that as their documents were onely to be taught and obeyed by all manner of people, both without, and within the Temples, so was himself in regard of his birth and quality, the man to be looked upon concerning the future Government of Myssia , since they found the old King intended not any more to come into the Countrey, having purchased a richer Kingdom, for the use of himself and posterity: They also intimated, that as his Father had lost both his power and fortunes, by flying from his Religion, and not conforming his deportments, to their wayes and instruction, in the same manner his own particular would be used by their congregation, if he should fail to observe their directions, in every circumstance belonging to his demeanour, since their Jurisdiction amongst the common people, concerning the service of the Gods, could not be disputed, much less contradicted either by the King or any of the Nobility: With these and the like intimations, they sent my Brother Argylius presently to travel, towards a certain Town upon the borders of Arabia , where Herenzius had planted first his factious doctrine, accompanied onely by those Governours of his youth, who were possessed with the same spirit of opposition, against the prosperity and quiet Dominion of all lawful Kings, that would not absolutely yield themselves to be ordered, by their tyrannical and fantastical Tenents; made up between excessive pride, and intollerable covetousness: In this Town you need not doubt, but that my young Brother was sufficiently instructed in those principles, which taught him such a strange and new disloyalty; especially being accompanied as I said with people of his own Countrey, who upon the first opportunity, were resolved to set a fire through the whole Kingdom of Myssia , as well for that they had in possession already my Fathers Estate, under the colour of having changed his Religion from the true worship of the Gods, as also in regard the old King had newly brought in the Government of the Flamins ; a cause great enough as they supposed, either to raise Rebellion, or commit what other injustices they pleased: But in the interim whilst Argylius continued for some years under this untoward Jurisdiction, hearing scarce any thing in their Orations but Treasons, my Mother oppressed by wants, and in a manner worn out with cares, paid nature her due, leaving this inconstant and unkinde world, as the certain inheritance of her young surviving Children: But King Euarchus comming to the Crown, after the decease of the old King of Lydia, Argylius also began to think of his return into his own Countrey, as it might be thought, not well knowing what would become either of his fortunes, or his power in the Kingdom of Myssia , by the change of the Prince, in regard Euarchus had married one of a contrary opinion to himself in matters of Religion. Nevertheless I must tell you, before he intended to put in execution his resolution for his journey, he was perswaded in his way to visit the principality of Pamphylia , where a young Brother and my self remained; as well to withdraw us from those opinions concerning the worship of the Gods, contrary to his practice, as to get us both if it were possible, into his power and possession, for that he knew much of his inheritance, was intended to be bequeathed unto us by our Father, in pursuance of certain agreements at my Mothers marriage: However in these desires he could not prevail; for as he was not suffered by the Laws of the Countrey, to attempt any thing upon us by force, so were we sufficiently prepared not to be wrought upon in our Religion, by the arguments of any of his company or followers; so that he was constrained to depart without effecting in that nature his designs: But to be short, notwithstanding my Brother Argylius failed of his intention, yet after his arriving in the Kingdom of Myssia , and finding the affairs of Euarchus something imbroiled, for the advantage of himself, he not onely by his power and solicitation, procured from the King an absolute judgement concerning my Fathers Islands he claimed, but also a decree of the Councel, that unless my young Brother remaining, and educated in Pamphylia under the Jurisdiction of the King of Egypt , did not presently return into the Kingdom of Myssia , he should for ever lose all that right of inheritance appertaining to him, either from his Father or any other: These motives or rather compulsions I may say, you may easily believe, were of sufficient force to work upon the nature and inconstant appetites of so young a disposition; especially when they were recommended to his ears and apprehension, by all the terrours of want and disgrace, that could be represented, either by craft or malice against the truth: Besides they told him in Myssia , he should live like a Prince upon his own fortunes, being supported by his Brothers greatness, whereas in Pamphylia he subsisted onely, by the grace and favour of strangers, to the dishonour of himself and extraction; which also perhaps as they said, would no longer last, then the affections and opinions continued of those, who were now in present authority, since their successors probably would not be so charitable, as no way having been acquainted formerly, either with him or his education. 'Tis true, I should have told you withal, that as my Mother dyed before my Father, so was he enduced during her life to make a journey in person into Lydia , to try what part of his means he could get towards his support, in which interim the Agents of Argylius as I related, took the opportunity to solicite but return. My Father being now dead by reason of his excessive cares, and my young Brother named Caterinus , in the absolute power of the Factious Priests of the Myssian Nation, his education and restraint confirmed also by the Kings authority, as they pretended according to the Laws of Lydia , it was not long before Argylius , the better to please his youth, towards his own advantage, procured him from Court some titles of honour; however he enjoyed them not long, for being suddenly taken with a violent burning Feaver, his death within a very few dayes after followed, leaving his possessions in the hands of our half Brother Argylius , as my self his true and rightful Heir, according to the customs of the Countrey, though I was never able any way to contend for my own, but as the contrary worship of the Gods, with the natural disability of our sexes, made me incapable of a prevailing power, so have I been constrained for some years, to be rather a suppliant to my Brothers bounty for my lawful Inheritance, then sufficiently emboldened to challenge any right in what I possess or enjoy; besides that I dare not publickly own my Religion, since an old woman called my Nurse, is set over me as a continual spy to all my employments, notwithstanding that formerly she belonged to my Mother: In this manner I may say, I now live, sometimes delighting my self amongst these solitary Woods, other whiles again removing to another habitation for my better recreation, where I spend my time innocently, instead of that liberty, both my birth and inheritance (descended unto me by a just right) requireth, if oppression were not too much befriended in these parts, which makes me daily pray the immortal Gods, the more earnestly for the Kings prosperity: Here again Joyela made another pawse, accompanied with two or three deep sighs, until in the end she returned anew to her discourse in this manner. As perhaps I have already sufficiently tired your patience, with those circumstances I have used in my relation, so will I now more briefly come to the period of my intentions, which is as well to let you see, how my half Brother Argylius , was brought more particularly to his opposition of Kingly Authority in this Nation; (and so consequently in the Kingdom of Lydia it self) as also what may be the chief motives, that detain him still in those actions and opinions. Although, said she, Argylius were bred up almost since his first infancy, (at leastwise from the time he was unnaturally taken from the protection of our now dead Father) in the pernitious Maximes of our factious and spightful Priests, yet notwithstanding, were they a long time both contraverted in his thoughts, and moderated in his practices, until the coming into the Countrey of old Lycius , (our now General) from the Armenian Wars, who gave the greatest attempt to his Loyalty, being a person famed both for his integrity in Religion, and skill in Martial Discipline: It would be needless to give you the true Character of his person, any more then to say, he is both dissembling and covetous in the highest degree; onely I shall relate unto you the chief reasons, that caused him to contract his inveterate malice and envy against Euarchus , by which means Argylius hath been induced to become an enemy to his Prince, if not some dishonour to his own posterity: Lycius by birth was so far from being of quality in the Kingdom of Myssia , that in other Countreys, he was forced to seek his living from ordinary professions: More I will not dispute, since who hath not the generosity of soul needful to a gallant person, what attributes soever nature could else bestow upon him, are too little, to render him worthy of a just estimation amongst vertuous people; however I cannot deny, but his extraordinary industry made him a competent (if not a fortunate) Souldier in the Wars, under that great Captain the Prince of Scythia in Armenia , where having also performed some services in the behalf of the Father of Cassianus , Brother in law to King Euarchus , made him presume so far of his deserts, (a story perhaps better known to your self then to me) that after all employments were ended in that Countrey, he returned into Lydia in hope of some gratification, according to the latitude of his own ambition and opinion: But being more neglected then he expected, Euarchus as it should seem, not fully at leasure to attend then the suit of any Souldier; or rather I may say accustomed to bestow honours and benefits with some ceremony, he with an extraordinary violence stew, not onely from the great City of Sardis , where the King remained, but soon quitted all the Territories of the Lydian Government, vowing to the Court a revenge, and destruction to the people: With these thoughts and exclamations, he quickly arrived at our chief Town of Lampsacus . 'Tis true his former fame in the Armenian Wars (which encreased a long time by his absence, and some moneys he had got in those employments, that for the present rendred him a little beneficial to our poor Countrey of Myssia ) gave him a great estimation amongst all sorts of conditions, which his spight to the Kings family, improved after this manner: He asked the Nobleman what was become of their native honour, to suffer themselves and long enjoyed priviledges, to be not onely overthrown, but trampled upon by the contemptible Ministers of their absent King, whose pleasures as he said in the luxurious Kingdom of Lydia , would not suffer him either to visit their dwellings, or rectifie their Grievances: To the Priests he talked of their Religion, now almost worn out of date, by the usurped power of the proud and impious Flamins , that in a manner governed all the Kings actions: And for the common people, it was sufficient to let them wonder at his professions, joyned with the enchanting words of a Commander abroad, whose opinion at leastwise was mighty in their apprehensions, by the noise of continual reports, before they saw his person: These and the like practices I say, gained him in a short space a most prevailing interest, both within and over the whole Nation, until the destinies had prepared other accidents for his advantage; amongst which number this was one, which I shall now tell you: The Arch Flamin of Lydia (whose greatness with Euarchus made him presume upon any attempt within his Dominions, that might render his orders more esteemed) being a man fuller of wit then judgement, and better learned in divine principles, then experienced in matters of State policy, thinking that Myssia was to be governed in the same manner as Lydia , without the danger either of Insurrections or Tumults, procured an absolute decree from the King, that the like conformity should be used concerning the Worship of the Gods in our Countrey, as in all the rest of the Territories belonging to his several Kingdoms, which being endeavoured to be put in execution at our great Town of Lampsacus , by some over officious Priests of his own Faction, of a sudden they found such resistance amongst the multitude, that presently tearing all the writings that were sent with those Instructions, they forced the Officers themselves to flye out of the Temples, for fear of their lives: You cannot doubt, but that this new beginning of stirs thus unexpectedly (if not indiscreetly) raised, gave encouragement sufficient for Lycius to prosecute his intended malice; insomuch as presently, he invited my Brother Argylius , (as being esteemed the most powerfullest person of all the Nobility) not onely in a publick way, to countenance the action, but also to seize upon the Kings Crown and other ornaments, then remaining in the Castle, either to his own use, or to be safely kept at his dispose, until such satisfaction should be given to the people, as might be justly required: As I doubt not, but you are better acquainted with many of these passages then my self, (I making more particularly the relations for the order and method of my story) so must I let you know, that my Brother upon this motion being scandalized, entertained the bold Instigation of Lycius , not onely with a pale and trembling countenance, but reproved him for his language; and instantly with some violence, withdrew himself from the rest of the company towards his own home. Two or three dayes Argylius kept himself in his own house, retired from the cries and importunities of the common people, until Lycius either enflamed in his rage, or carried up by his presumption, entred his dwelling with this threatning language: My Lord, said he, if the Gods worship and the honour of our Nation, be to be preserved at this instant from utter destruction, why should you, being the greatest of the Nobility flye cowardly from the occasion, when it is offered into your hands? Will you shew your self now fearful in the face of the multitude, being so willing either to make you their King, or raise your dignity to be the chief Governour of the Myssian State? Is it possible, you should thus falsifie all the hopes, those vertuous and wise Priests have had, both in your education and promised piety? Must it be expected, we should now fall back, without bringing upon our selves, such a slavery as can never be redeemed, without the forfeitture of our lives and fortunes? Shall the insulting Flamins in the Countrey of Lydia , triumph and trample upon our liberties, without disputing the least Article of our Rights or Religion? No no, my Lord, said he, if you continue still in this minde, I here vow by the goodness and power of the immortall Gods, that as the people have already chosen me, to be their Commander over the Souldiers, you shall be the first person that must taste the fury of their spleens, since you refuse to be a Protector in so great and glorious a cause, that speaks honour to your Family, and safety to all the Countrey. Argylius whether or no convinced by these reasons being induced thereunto by the corruption of his former education? Or whether the fearfulness of his own nature, made him condescend to his perswasion, as doubting else he might finde some troubles in the possession of his estate? at last yielded his consent, to perform those actions, which he and the Souldiers should judge most conveniently, for the good of the whole Kingdom: Here perhaps you will tell me, that no threatning language whatsoever should have prevailed against either a noble courage, or a just disposition, so far as to have forced a party, to have quit that interest and loyalty, upon which depended both honour and religion, since without the exact observance of fidelity, confirmed by the solemnity of sacred oaths between a King and his people, the certainty of humane accords cannot be hoped for or expected: To which I shall make no other answer, said she, then what excuses may be gathered from my former relation, my Brother being taken young with violence, out of the protection of his worthy and religious Father, and committed to the custody of them, who ever since have endeavoured to pervert his thoughts, towards their sinister purposes against all Kingly Government; or followed by a mercy that may resemble the Gods goodness: With these sayings another gentle shower of tears distilled from her eyes, yet in such a manner, as seemed to express more of sorrow in her minde of what was past, then any hope in her apprehension, concerning that which was to come; either doubting her brothers repentance, or fearing Arethusius forgiveness: Nevertheless within a while after, she returned a new to her discourse, the rather for that she perceived the earnest looks of Meliander , attended the end of her relations, with some more then ordinary passion. When (said she) my unfortunate Brother Argylius , was thus won to a certain kind of disloyalty, by the perswasion of spiteful Lycius , to begin his first disobedient attempt to his Prince, he was carried with those Royal Ornaments belonging to the King, by many of the common people, in a kinde of a ceremonial triumph, to a Castle of his own, not far from the City of Lampsacus . From this day forward, I must tell you, that Argylius became more violent in his wayes; whether grown desperate of the Kings mercy, after he had shewed his own ingratitude in this high nature, in recompence of those many favours he had received; or as I told you before, being absolutely terrified by the insulting and threatening words which Lycius had delivered, insomuch as presently joyning with such Councels, as seemed most disadvantageable for the Kings affairs, he gave his consent to the raising of a speedy Army for the Countreys defence, as they pretended, although in truth it was onely intended, to take away all Monarchical Power and Government in Myssia: Here if I should say, that Euarchus was punished by the Gods severity, for that inhumane injustice was done my dead Father, in not onely taking from him the protection of his children, but the use of his estate, against the common right of nature and morality, I think I should not much erre, before the eyes of any judgement, that carried with it an equal consideration in matters of equity and religion. This Army I must tell you, was no soones raised, and put under the command of presumptuous Lycius , but the whole Commonalty were taxed generally, whereby the better to contribute towards the charge, whilst in the interim many of the most factious Priests of the Nation, were designed by their pernitious Rhetorick, as well to perswade the peoples belief, toward the commodity and profit of the action, as concerning the lawfulness of such attempts in the Gods Worship, which within a while after became fortified, by the contrained Oaths of every one in particular to that purpose, lest in the interim any person should refuse his voluntary subscription. It was not possible but that Euarchus should come to the hearing of these proceedings, whereupon presently dispatching some Messengers to Lampsacius , he desired as well to be satisfied in their meanings, as to be better informed of their Grievances; but withal wisht those employed, that if they could not finde his enemies in the Countrey any way inclined to accord differences, to use their best endeavours, whereby his own party might be encreased amongst the people: Both these designs failing either by the want of fidelity of his Ambassadours, or the powerfulness of his adversaries, he resolved presently to provide an Army in Lydia , to compel his disobedient Subjects of Myssia to some reason: 'Tis true, the quick march of the Kings Souldiers, made us see our own folly and weakness, to provoke a Princes goodnesse to that rigour, which his too gentle nature neither expected or desired, insomuch as although we had then a flying Army in the field, under the conduct and command of our proud Generall Lycius , yet in a manner were we forced without one blow given, to yield our selves up to the mercy and lenity of Euarchus , who being more pittiful in his disposition, then mistrustfull of our disloyalties, gave us peace instead of taking revenge, in which circumstance Lycius made a solemn protestation, never after that day to draw his sword against the Kings person or right; pretending however, that his goodness bad more conquered his resolutions, then the power of his weapons or people: This action I the ampler mention, though perhaps you better know it then my self, that you may behold the falshood of Lycius , who at first, not onely brought the misfortune upon my Brother, but since a fatal misery to the whole Nation; since no sooner was he made certain of the Kings departure out of the Countrey, but forgetting his Oaths, and renuing his infidelity, he perswaded the Nobility to an absolute breach of all those Articles that had been agreed upon between themselves and their Prince, upon pretences that they had yielded up their Countrey a liberty, to the Kings onely will and pleasure, either by reason of their Commissioners fraud, or their own fear, not onely to the enslaving of all the common peoples liberties, but the destruction of the Gods Worship: To fortifie which allegation, he also stirr'd up many turbulent Priests, by frequent Orations amongst the multitude, to exclaim violently against the proceedings, threatning an absolute ruine to all such, that did not by their future endeavours, demonstrate themselves and Family to be of the same opinion. Many dayes had not been spent in these furies, with other consultations of the same nature, before Lycius by the Souldiers power under his command, set upon the strong Castle of Lampsacus , wherein the King had newly (according to the agreement) placed a formal Garrison; however not as yet sufficiently fortified for a defence, by reason that time was wanting to the expedition: 'Tis true the Captain being thus surprized contrary to his thoughts and imagination, and before he had provided materials for his purpose, notwithstanding he was esteemed a Commander of most excellent skill and knowledge in the wars, was forced to yield the place after a short siege, to the will and mercy of those, which had trayterously encompassed him round about to his excessive grief. You may very well think that these breaches of faith, could not be maintain'd, but by the endeavours of greater insolencies; and my Brother being in the number of those Noblemen, that had apparantly addicted themselves to the Faction of Lycius , he supposed the favour of the King, was not again to be purchased in his particular; besides many other persons having lost their rich pensions at Court, being willing to joyn in the same belief, they became within a short space, desperate both in their disloyalty and spite; insomuch as presently dispatching Messengers to the great City of Sardis , (which they knew to be infected with some discontents concerning Euarchus Government, or rather grown sick with their own prosperity) to see how many of their inhabitants, they could corrupt towards their party; I must confess (said Joyela ) you may judge my folly something too impertinent, thus to make relation of those things, which you cannot be ignorant of, but in regard divers passages will be mixed with the information, (not altogether as I conceive so publick) for the order of my discourse, I must desire your patience, until I shall come to the period of my intention, concerning what I have to say. Lady, replied Meliander , though nothing were related, that could be useful to the Kings designs, yet discourses proceeding from such beautiful and vertuous lips, were of themselves informations of sufficient consequence; but being also accompanied with those essential knowledges you have already declared, I cannot but esteem my self extream happy in this incounter, as well for my own particular satisfaction as the Princes affairs; so that I do most humbly beseech you, to continue still the honour you have hitherunto done me, by this most fortunate accident: Joyela smiling a little, proceeded again in this manner When these Messengers or Ambassadours (for I know not which to call them, since their entertainments proved extraordinary) were come to the great and rich City of Sardis , they presently addicted themselves to the Kings presence, in a ceremonious visit, as pretending nothing but the occasion of their many grievances, had drawn them out of their own Countrey of Myssia , to offer their complaints to his Majesty for redress; however in the interim, they onely kept company with such people, whom they knew to be most disaffected towards his government and prosperity: And notwithstanding Euarchus assured them that they should be willingly heard, if not rectified in all their desires, yet would they not be satisfied, without also demanding the consent of his people, in which consisted as they said, both his good and their own safeties. As this answer did wholly displease the King, since he very well perceived, they intended to make some combination contrary to his liking with other factions, as well of the Court as in the City, so was it not long before their intentions appear'd in the full view of all the Kingdom; for being invited to continual feasts and meetings in Sardis , they told the multitude, it was impossible to render them fortunate and happy in after ages, unless the great Senate of Lydia were presently called together: How much this was against the designs and prosperity of the King, you may very well imagine, when as a constrained duty put upon the Prince, for the most part is ominous to him or his Subjects; however our Countreymen the Myssians in this plot, had a double benefit to expect; an assurance of their own conditions, and a plentiful recompence for their endeavours: In fine, when they found Euarchus not onely perceived their intentions, but distasted the enterprize, as destructive both to his honour and prerogative, they privately made an agreement with some principall persons of their own faction, that if the King could not be perswaded to assemble this general Councel, they would endeavour the raising of an Army in Myssia , and lead them instantly into the very heart of the Lydian Territories; whereby (as they said) Euarchus might be compelled, to grant his people those priviledges, that neither his nature, nor his goodness, was willing to afford them voluntarily; provided that in lieu of this extraordinary service, the Lydian people would be content to defray the expence, and grant the Myssians an equal Government in all manner of affairs with themselves in each Kingdom; in which design, as my Brother and Lycius were principal instruments, so would they probably receive most benefit by the enterprize, as persons that were much more eminent then any of the rest of the Nobility; the one commanding our Army, as the other ruled the Countrey; all others in a manner being out of the Kingdom, or bred up at the Court: Not to hold you much longer in expectation of my discourses, as this agreement was quickly (though privately) made, so was an Army under the actuall conduct of dissembling Lycius soon brought into Lydia , to the wonderful amazement of the King and all his party; insomuch as being thus surprized of a sudden contrary to his thoughts, and finding many traytors of the Myssian Faction about his person, he was constrained presently to assemble together this great Councel, which since hath been so fatal to him and his Family, as your self can better apprehend them I: But now to the conclusion, that I may say hath chiefly occasioned this tedious discourse, doubting the information will scarce countervail the expectation, when as hitherunto it hath been rather governed by the imperfections of a young womans fancy, then any way satisfactory to a knowing judgement such as yours is: Here again Meliander would have interrupted her by some new complements: but Joyale perceiving his meaning told him, that as she had but a very few words more towards the finishing of her purpose, so must she earnestly desire his patience until that should be ended, in that she feared, the like conveniency would not be again afforded to them both, by reason of her own privacy from the conversation of all those of the Royal Parties Interest. By these relations, said she, that I have made unto you (in which I have been the more large, in regard no circumstance might be omitted tending to my purpose) you may see, how my Brother Argylius came involved by degrees in his disloyalties towards his Prince; first by his education, next by accident, and lastly by the perswasion, or rather threatnings of spleenitive and insolent Lycius: 'Tis true, I cannot deny, but his own nature is sufficiently addicted to covetousness and ambition, which perhaps keep still his disposition, incumbred with those thoughts and appetites, not possible as I fear to be bridled and reformed, without, some assurances of his continuall governing of the Myssian Nation: For who hath once tasted the sweet of Sovereignty, although but in imagination onely, can scarce be brought again within the compass of any manner of obedience, or subjection to higher power, however grounded upon never so just a title; which is the reason that both himself and Lycius , have opposed the Kings coming into the Countrey at present, by all the interest they could make, rendring their persons utter enemies to all his glory and prosperity underhand, notwithstanding in words and outward complements, they seem to comply with the rest of the people; so that unless one young King Arethusius , would be content to marry with the Daughter of Argylius (though the mystery be not yet revealed, which they believe would give them both an assurance and perpetuity in command) he will finde from their particulars alwayes, nothing but Treasons instead of services: As I have been thus free with your particular, in declaring these secrets, however they may seem something against my own interest, it being almost a miraculous vertue in these dayes to prefer loyalty before profit; so must I conjure you by all the ties of honour and religion, that my name may not any way be used in the discovery; nevertheless you may make what use you please of that I have declared: and for the better truth and confirmation of what I have related, you must know I have this certainty from the conversation I enjoy amongst the women in the house and family of Argylius ; neither as I suppose, will it be long before you are made acquainted with this motion by other means: In the interim take heed lest Lycius betray not the Army under his command to the Lydian -power; since money will make him sell, not onely the person, and honour of the King, but the very worship of the Gods to any enemy whatsoever: if what I have delivered cannot contribute to my Brothers benefit, at leastwise, I wish it may to the Kings safety; for designs being known, are easier made use of for prevention, onely without offence (for suspition I hope you have none, since you perceive my duty is above my blood) give me leave to say for Argylius ; that I have often heard him protest, as his heart never went along with the Kings suppression, so had he no other intentions in his thoughts at first, then to have the Gods worshipped, according to the Myssian manner in both Kingdoms; however I cannot deny, but lately his imaginations and designs, have been buried from the knowledge of his best and nearest friends, which in the future, I hope the heavens will reveal for the good and prosperity of Arethusius : If these apologies may serve any way to lessen I say, my Brothers crimes, I shall be glad, if not, I am confident notwithstanding of my own duty, both to my house, and towards my Prince, in which two particulars the integrity of my Religion, can sufficiently bear witness to the world: With these words accompanied by pauses, sighs, and tears, she finished totally her discourse, leaving Meliander in some perplexity what to reply; since as of one side he could not but a little doubt, lest she had borrowed a great deal of dissimulation, to colour a hidden ambition toward her own preferment, either in marriage or otherwise, not thinking such a vertue could proceed from so ill a mixture of kindred, so on the other part considering, the sweet innocency of her countenance, with the multitude of tears she had shed during her relations, joyned withall the circumstances belonging to her Fathers oppressions, and her own education, coming into Myssia onely to claim her right of inheritance, or at the farthest to obtain a competent subsistance from her Estate, at last resolved to make her this answer. Madam said he, the Gods defend me from such an impiety, as any way to suspect so absolute a beauty as you possess, joyned with so high appearing vertue, that if it were in the election of Prince Arethusius to make freely, and without partiality his own choice, I do not see where the heavens could grant him a greater happiness, then by casting his whole and entire affection upon your admired person: But if the Gods have determined otherwise of your purposes, as you have already been pleased to intimate by your discourse, what can be more for his advantage and honour, then to marry the daughter of Argylius? supposing she wants not any perfections befitting her years, birth, and breeding, since by that conjunction, her Fathers ambition will not onely be fully satisfied, and the assurance of his present Government the better established to his contentment, but a general reconciliation of all appearing differences, will undoubtedly follow, to the perpetual prosperity of this yet unfortunate Kingdom; by reason of those unnatural mistrusts engender'd between the King, Noblemen, and People; besides a terrible and threatning Army ready to destroy all our remaining fortunes and liberty: so that your resolution continuing as I say in this posture, having absolutely placed your thoughts in a higher region, and by that diversion you are content to cast this lot of conjunction upon your Neece, Arethusius our now King must finde out some other way, to discharge the score of his obligations towards your self, whose misfortunes I hope shall never take from him the vertues of his minde, bestowed upon him both by nature and education. Sir said she, (cutting him off in the half of his professions) as in civility I cannot but thank you for these expressions (which, whether onely complements or no, I hold my self tyed to acknowledge) so of the other side, I do desire you to believe, that a higher duty hath possessed my soul for these discoveries, then any way my own particular ends do aim at, being the preservation of the Kings person; however if my Neece can obtain the honour coveted, and our poor Countrey by that means be preserved from ruine, as I shall not envy the ones happiness, so shall I intirely rejoyce for the others fortunes. Meliander more and more admiring Joyela's vertues and goodness, taking her white hand in his, he sealed with his lips a seeming confirmation of her opinion and desire, using withal these words in the ceremony: Lady said he, as upon this pure Altar, I witness both your worth and my own sacrifice, so do I vow never willingly to attend any of the occasions of Prince Arethusius , without continually putting him in minde, of those high obligatious he owes to your supream goodness and afffection. Much time more was not spent in communication, between the Lady Joyela and Meliander , before he took his leave, and went presently to the Boat, which being unloosed from the Bank side, quickly conveyed him over the River towads the place of his abode: In the interim many several thoughts imployed his minde: Some while he imagined, that Joyela notwithstanding her fair shews and pretences, might yet dissemble in her intentions, being carried with some secret passions of love to the young Prince, or be transported by the natural ambition of her Brother Argylius , to set on work some pernicious design in his behalf tending to that purpose: But when he considered the innocency of her looks, with the multitude of tears she had shed in the discourse, besides the circumstances of her life and interest, which she had so particularly related unto him, he esteemed it an impossibility, she should falsifie in that manner, and in those reflections began to consider, whether or no it might not be an advantage to the present affairs of the King, either to contract a marriage with Argylius Daughter, who wanted nothing in birth or breeding worthy of such a conjunction; or at the least to feign such a willingness in him, until his establishment in the Kingdom of Myssia , were better grounded, both to his person and posterity: With this fancy he either sealed, or endeavoured to perswade his resolution, whilst he could finde a fit opportunity to communicate his thoughts to the Prince his Master, which within a very few dayes space he found a conveniency to do. Nevertheless the King, after he had with a kinde of attentive patience, heard out the full period of all that Meliander had a minde to say, he lifted up his eyes to Heaven, with these words in his mouth: Is it possible said he, that any vertue or honour can remain in that trayterous family? No, no Meliander , these seeming compliances, are nothing but cunning baits guilded over with deadly poison, the more easily to betray my youth and innocency, however I am confident enough that Argylius ambition, may carry him high enough in his imaginations, whereby to think that his unworthy daughter, is a match fit for the unfortunate Son of slaughtered Euarchus , who consequently must stand in need of his assistance, to renew that quarrel, now almost laid asleep by the insensibility of all other Princes and Monarchs of the lesser Asia: But O you Gods defend said he, my yet unblemisht honour and courage, from giving ear to these enchantments, either of sensuality or falshood, whereby I may keep my self still a Prince, meriting at leastwise a noble pitty from my equals, though I dye prosecuted by my inferiours, hoping that my spightful fates, shall never be able so far to prevail with the Heavens, as to debar me of a monument worthy the memory of a King, however fortune never smiled upon my prosperity: neither shall a traytors Daughter be ever said, to be the companion of my disasters or vertues, though I return to new banishments; which death can finish when the Gods please, notwithstanding what power or malice soever. Meliander perceiving the Prince (as he thought) to be transported with the spleenitive suspicion, he had contracted in his imagination, against the past proceedings of Argylius , which made him in a manner loath all correspondency with his affairs, much less any inclination to become his Son- in law, notwithstanding any terms of conveniency or benefit could be offered to his present condition, his courage being as I may say, much greater than his concernment, since the value of a Crown, could not weigh down in his opinion, the onely denomination of vertue and honour, humbly besought him, that however his youthful passions, could not be for the present, absolutely converted, into a real belief of the Ladies integrity; at leastwise he would be pleased in some sort for charities sake, to suspend his judgement towards a Virgin Lady, until some more trials could be had concerning the turht of her informations: This as he said was not long to be concealed, either in the fortune, or proceeding of the War, no more then what belonged to the intended match of the Daughter of Argylius , which no doubt would afford him a double benefit; the one in more fully discovering his enemies intentions, and laying open thereby Argylius intollerable ambition to the rest of the Nobility; the other in letting the world perceive by plain demonstration, how a few persons for their own ends and covetousness, had appetites if not designs to betray the Army; and by consequence the whole Countrey to the Lydian power and jurisdiction, whilst himself nor one of his party, could be admitted to any imployment or command amongst the Souldiers: Wherefore he desired him to bury all his thoughts and suspicions from the eyes of vulgar knowledge, since it would be a great deal better for the people to finde their own errours, by the loss, then by his information; which perhaps else they would interpret but as a prophetical spight in him, before the issue was determined either by action or probability; and to this purpose if he pleased, he might retire to some place convenient for the recreation of hunting, there to spend his time free from any danger of plots, or the least suspicion of jealousie, either concerning his own person, or the contrivements of his followers. As at last Arethusius became entirely perswaded by Melianders councel, so the conveniency of the Callidonian Forrest (some distance from the City of Lampsacus ) invited both the Princes courage and endeavours, to put in execution such a resolution, accompanied onely by Meliander and some few of his most trusty servants, where they intended not onely to sport themselves for a season, but also further to consult as there should be occasion: The Forrest was divided equally between Mountains and Plains, however in many places over-shadowed with mighty trees of such an incredible height, that they seemed proudly to threaten the lofty heavens in ambition; whilst the inhabitants of those Woods, were a certain kinde of wilde Cattle resembling white Bulls, their manes being long and cursed like Lions of the greatest size, and their roarings not much differing from such creatures, when most fierce and enraged after their prey: Many dayes Arethusius the Prince had not spent in these recreations, having oftentimes in the interim, shewed both his courage and dexterity in the pursuit, when one afternoon being something tired, either with the fulness of his pleasure, or by the troublesomness of his thoughts, he remained some space behinde all the company; insomuch as at last being altogether out of sight, and a little entangled in his passage, with the rude and thick bushes, he was put to no small consideration, how to redeem himself from that imprisonment; at leastwise without inconveniency, to come again before night to the place of his abode: but the more he strived by divers careful turnings, to winde his horses steps in those thickets, towards the right way, he procured thereby more and more his own confusion; until at last being in a little despair, by reason the Sun as he perceived was almost set (however he had recovered something an even and large path for his better satisfaction) he might behold a certain image coming against him, resembling a man: Upon his nearer approach he very well saw, that nothing covered his naked body, but a Panthers skin, cut rudely into the fashion of a short coat, the onely defence he had, whereby to resist either heat or cold: The eyes in the head of this seeming Monster, stared with such appearing terrour, that if the Princes courage had not been much greater than his apprehension, he would presently have fled from so horrid a spectacle: When he came at so convenient a distance, that his words might be heard, as he thought by this appearing spirit, Arethasius with confidence enough demanded whom he was, whose disasters or fates had driven as he said, to such a miserable condition, that it was a question, whether he was to be accounted amongst the living or the dead, since however his motion seemed to make him of one opinion, yet his aspect in a manner confirmed his thoughts towards another? especially finding him alone in those deserts, where nothing as he believed inhabited, but wilde Beasts and infernal Ghosts: Scarce had Arethusius made an end of speaking thus much, when the Savage creature without other circumstances, began to laugh so loud, that the Woods appeared to tremble with the outrageousness of the noise, until at last he bellowed out these strange predictions to his apprehension, though in the interim he winked with both his eyes, as if he feared what himself intended to utter.  The Callidonian Prophet thee doth tell, Thou art our rightful King he knows it well: But cannot Reign within the Myssian Land, Till Fates have conquered Foes unto thy hand; A longer Course thou yet must run in shew, To purchase Fame, or gain a Grave below; How ere this certainty by Gods have been reveal'd, A Prince from Syrian Blood shall be recall'd, And great Euarchus in his lasting Line Must here on earth, and in Olimpus shine, When slaughtered, people will put an end To all the cruelty, that Time and War shall send. With these words, and an unspeakable horrour in his countenance, he presently parted from the King, taking his way through the neighbouring Woods with so much celerity, that he could not possible be esteemed of humane generation; but rather produced from some infernal conjunction: It cannot be doubted but this unexpected encounter, accompanied by such passages in that desert habitation, when also the chearful light of the heavens became something obscured, by the natural descent of the Sun, could not chuse but move a young mans thoughts to many apprehensions of fear and terrour; which kept Arethusius a long time as it were frozen in a stupid amazement, until at the length having a little better recollected his spirits, considering the necessity of his present condition, being altogether lost in the Forrest by his company, he began again to put himself into a new posture of travel, to try whether or no, he could finde out some probable passage, whereby to attain to any dwelling, that might inform him of the nature, and wayes of the Countrey: As the paths he traced were very uncertain, being scarce beaten at any time by humane creatures, so would the approaching night as he thought, prove an absolute impediment to that commodity of information which he sought: These perturbations of his minde, occasioned by the wilde mans demeanour and predictions, was no small hinderance either to his industry or endeavours; for he could not chuse, but reflect with more than an earnest attentiveness, as well upon the words he had delivered, as at the manner of his appearing in that solitary wilderness; though sometime he imagined it onely to be a meer fancy, proceeding from the several workings of his own thoughts and passions: But when he considered all the circumstances, with the manner of his carriage, and horrid shapes of his person, appearing to his full view in the open day light, he was so far from conceiving it to be a dream, that he either perswaded himself, the party was some Devil sent from God Pluto's infernal habitation, to hinder again his prosperity in the Kingdom of Myssia , or otherwise a Prophet of those Woods directed from Divine Oracles, to give him timely warning, both concerning his present concernments, and his future fortunes; insomuch as he began a little to repent him, that he had not more violently endeavoured to have stayed his course, whereby to be better instructed in his skill and knowledge: With these apprehensions the Prince more particularly reflected again upon those rimes which the old Prophet had distinctly delivered, until within a short space, he had as he thought reduced them clearly to his memory, according to that order and method they are recited: But however Prince Arethusius fears were pretty well qualified and allayed, by his consideration and natural courage (his youth being perswaded to a favourable interpretation of the Gods purposes) yet the sudden darkening of the element, whilst he was busily imployed in these diversities of distractions, brought upon him a new trouble, not onely how he might get out of the danger of those Woods, (being as he knew inhabited by divers sorts of ravenous Beasts of sundry natures) to some convenient lodging, but also his thoughts became filled with many imaginations concerning his future fates (for that uncouth seasons for the most part, are accustomed to create horrour and dread in all suggestions of what kinde soever they be) however at last the Moon by little and little getting up to his no small satisfaction, he was quickly induced to alight from his horse, the more commodiously to force a passage through the thick bushes, which hindered the way with no small inconveniency to his design and intention; which at last brought his steps to something an ample plain, scarce as he thought such another to be found within the circumference of those Woods; the farther end thereof seeming to be crowned, or rather overlooked by a hill, whose sides, however they appeared rough and rocky, yet was it so pleasantly ordered by nature, that from many parts of the stony entrals, issued some runlets and currents of water making divers noises, that at length gathering themselves in a liquid body at no far distance, unitingly made a pretty Brook, which gave a kinde of fertility, if not delightfulness to that pasturage, easily to be discerned by the favour of the Moon, having now discovered her fainting beauty to the full view and best advantage. The King upon these considerations, being much wearied by reason of his uncertain travels, also something terrified with his late apparition, and out of all hope to recover any of his company, that night resolved until morning should appear, to repose both his body and his thoughts in some accidental cave, which he might finde within the boweis of that hill; but failing, he intended to make the bare ground a resting place during the season for his person, supposing his wakeful eyes with his Sword drawn ready in his hand, should defend him from all wilde oppressions, of what nature soever: so that putting the bridle over his horses head, and tying one end of it loosely to his girts, lest his too much wantonness might stray afore morning, farther then was convenient for his commodity, he left him presently in this posture, and went as he had determined to seek out his own lodging; where, as he was searching very earnestly every hollow nook within the Rocks, at last he perceived with some satisfaction to his many apprehensions, the shadow of a house, sufficiently appearing to his view by two or three lights in the windows: As this was (as it might be thought) no small content to his wearied senses, and no less tired imaginations (having met in his adventures with such diversities of encounters and disasters) so instantly without any delay, he hastned to this expected, and (as he hoped for) fortunate habitation: at leastwise so judged by his fancy, if not with his reason. When he approached the entrance, he might perceive, that many fair trees in an orderly manner, gave both beauty and commodity to a grassie walk before the gate; from the portal on either side ran an even wall, which inclosed in the court belonging to the house: long he was not knocking at the door, before it was opened to his sight by the Porter, who as it should seem diligently attended his office: The Prince after salutation told him in haste, and with something a distracted and troubled countenance, that he was a Gentleman belonging to the King services, who being overtaken by the night, in the sport of Hunting, amongst the intricate passages of the Forrest, was by chance forced to seek refuge in some house, whereby a little to comply with his own necessities, which he hoped he should finde correspondent to his wishes, in that appearing plentiful habitation. The fellow as it might seem courteous enough in his nature, though perhaps made so a great deal more through his education, without either much suspicion, or many impertinent questions, presently let him in at the gate; and not long after conducted him to a large Hall, where not a few people of divers sorts, were warming themselves about a fire in the middle of the place, whilst others again sate upon Benches along the wall-sides: Though the Porter there left him, yet first he said, he would cause some information to be given to his Lord concerning his arrival: Scarce had Arethusius fallen into communication, with two or three of the best of the company, though he was resolved not to disclose one syllable of his strange adventures, meeting with the wilde man in the Woods, much less what he had related unto him, before he was sent for by the master of the house into the Parlor; who beholding at his entrance a person of such an extraordinary beauty and proportion, however his aspect for the present inclined something to paleness, in regard of his late terrifying visions, after the Lord had for a pretty space stood in a kinde of a maze, as it were wondering at those excellencies that appeared to his eyes, saluted him with this language. Sir said he, as your youthful and promising countenance, might challenge a more then ordinary respect, from people of what quality soever, so of the other side, bringing with you as I am informed, the title of being an attendant upon our noble King Arethusius (however I had never yet the happiness to behold his person) puts upon my thoughts more then a sufficient obligation, to treat you with all those curtesies and civilities, that either this habitation shall afford, or my own nature and education can perform: And with these words conducted him to the upper end of the room, whilst in the interim the King made both glad of his accommodation, and confident of his friendship, by reason of these free expressions, quickly returned him this answer: As the tryals of noble dispositions are most apparent, when demonstrated in straits and necessities; so of the other side can I no way doubt, but that Prince you are pleased to mention, though hitherunto something unfortunate, either in the power of fidelity of his supposed friends, will not prove at all ungrateful for my entertainment, much less for his own obligations, if his fates hereafter any way become propitious to his purposes: A few other complements onely passing between them, they both sate down together in a large chair, spending the time in the interim, with many several discourses of divers natures, which increased more and more the opinion, the old Nobleman had conceived of his new guest; whilst at last a supper was served upon the table, though plentiful enough to content the family, yet tasted something of the want of curiosities in the Myssian Countrey, which pretended rather to grossness in diet, then neatness of accommodation; however the Wine was excellent, as the Sweet-meats abounding; by which circumstances the King might gather, that his entertainer was of the best quality of his Nation, though his own bashfulness as yet forbore all enquiries to that effect, imagining before his departure, he should not want a convenient season to that purpose: When they had supped, accompanied by some women of the family, who presently again retired after the meal was ended, they fell to discourses of trivial natures, rather as might be said to pass away the time towards digesture, then to procure knowledge, or information by the circumstances, until the old Lord conceiving the stranger a little wearied by reason of his journey; or indeed himself accustomed to keep good hours, not onely called his servants to know whether the travellers Chamber were ready, but took him by the hand, and conducted him towards a room well furnished with a fire, instead of other magnificencies; where presently leaving him to his rest, attended onely by the Steward of the house, and one servant to supply the place of a Groom, himself also retired to his appartment. Arethusius beginning now to be more curious after information then sleep, the man being gone out of the Chamber to provide some necessaries for his better repose, desired the favour of the Steward that he might know, not onely to what person he owed the obligation of his present entertainment, but also the occasion and circumstances, that had made him happy by so vertuous and noble an acquaintance, which he should esteem as he said a good fortune ever after; besides he might thereby, be better able to give an account to the King his Master, concerning his own adventures. Truly Sir replied the Steward, although I could wish you now some rest, in regard of your troublesome and weary journey, the night being far spent, and my story perhaps may not much suit with your concernments, yet in regard you seem pleased to impose the injunction upon me at present, knowing that my Lord and Master intends really your satisfaction, in all things within this poor Dominion, as a person that hath so near a relation to the King, I shall most willingly apply my self to the fulfilling of your commands in this particular, as in any other thing may afford you content. To this purpose then be pleased to know said he, that my old Lord and most bountiful Master by birth, claimed the first title in honour, of this ancient, though now unfortunate Kingdom of Myssia ; and the Nobility for the most part being inclinable in their natures, to seek breeding or subsistance in forreign regions, rather then to be fed with the productions of their own barren Countrey, which I may say hath brought forth in all times, rather troubles and want of fidelity to their Kings, then satisfaction to themselves, until at last new opinions concerning the Worship of the Gods, that thwarted the obedience formerly given to the Temple of Delphos , seemed to afford sufficient imployment to the thoughts and mindes of all sorts of people; not onely with violence contending one against another, but sometimes even driving out their Kings and Queens from the peaceable Government of their own Rights and Dominions, made him a traveller; however Euarchus Father by his much wisdom though more policy, made a shift during his reign (especially in the latter part thereof) to keep all things in quiet postures; pretending that else his succession to the rich Kingdome of Lydia would be obstructed, as well to his loss as their detrement, which maintained us in peace as I said, until Euarchus our late King came to the Crown of both Dominions: In the interim as I told you at the first, my Lord being induced by the custome of the Countrey, and his own generous nature to travel, according to the manner of the Nobility in the general, whether by chance or design prosecuting of his intention, he arrived at the great and famous City of Delphos ; where either taken with the beauties and glories of the Temple, or absolutely convinced as he thought in his former errours, not onely in minde seemed to quit his opinions, but openly professed to the world his change of Religion, as well for that he found his Countreymen became rebellious in holding the contrary, as that the appearing faith and practice of Delphos , had onely continued constant during many ages without disobedience to their superiours and governours, which perhaps kept him longer abroad then he determined: But at last hearing Euarchus Father had settled a quiet felicity in the Kingdom of Myssia , contrary to all mens expectations, both with the peoples actions and their consciences, and that he had altogether suppressed the factions against himself and Government, he ventured once more to see his own patrimony, notwithstanding he had been offered very fair preferments abroad, as well in the Wars of other Princes, as concerning imployments belonging to Religion and Learning: With these hopes as I say of a peaceable continuance, within a year or there about after his resolution, he came to the City of Lampsacus , where yet he hath a dwelling answerable to his degree, if any quality whatsoever, could keep him from the miserable oppression of the times, where he intended for the most part to remain, contenting himself, that he had not onely as he thought made choice of the best Worship of the Gods, free from faction and the least seeming disloyalty to his Prince, but had also furnished both his eyes and knowledge, with the greatest curiosities in nature or arts, that the world could produce: In this posture you must know, he soon took a Wife equal unto him both in birth and fortunes; many years they lived together most happily, as well for that they agreed in all religious duties, as the Gods bestowed upon their chaste endeavours a plentiful issue, some of which you saw this night at supper; the rest being either dead or dispersed through the world, according to the diversity of their several fates; though my Lady in the interim, was taken into the heavens, for her own goodness and unexampled charity used amongst people, during her life here in this earthly habitation: Whilst the Steward was continuing this discourse, the servant formerly mentioned came again into the Chamber; insomuch as being warned by the officers direction another time to depart, he instantly retired, leaving them to their private communication, which returned the discreet Gentleman to this new prosecution of his relation. I must tell you said he, that however my Lord being a most solitary Widower in regard of his dear loss, yet did he live with splendor enough in his Countrey; sometimes at Lampsacus and other houses belonging to himself and family; other whiles again he took a pleasure to retire both his person and thoughts, within the compass of these melancholly Woods, either for the benefit of contemplation, or the better to refresh his spirits in this Forrest of Calledonia , who is by birth and inheritance the chief Ranger thereof under the King, until the Father of Euarchus dying, the Son came into the Kingdom of Myssia to be Crowned: So that my Master with the rest of the Nobility of the Countrey entertaining him, according to the dignity of those ceremonies then used, himself was created by his Royal Prerogative, into some of the highest and most eminent Titles of Honour, as being a person belike noted of principal fidelity to his Prince, whereas many others seemed to contradict his proceedings, in divers matters that belonged to his future command and jurisdiction: Whether this special favour or no procured my Lord more envy I will not say? but so it was, Euarchus our King soon again returning into Lydia , it happened not long after his departure, that many of the Priests of our Nation, with some of the discontented Nobility, began to shew evident signes, not onely of their ambition, but their spight, demonstrated as well by their actions as their discourses: The first pretence of their dislike was, that their King neither at the present remained in the Countrey, or intended to live amongst them ever after, which as they said in time would impoverish the whole generality, without the least hope of advancing either their esteems, or continuing their fortunes, in that his Deputies did nothing else but sell Justice to the People, and dishonour the Nobility, whereby the better to be able to procure favour from the Lydian Court, which at that distance onely endeavoured to command every persons actions, of what degree or fidelity soever: The next subject of their complaints seemed to be, that the rites belonging to the Worship of the Gods, for the most part was destroyed, by introducing of the new customs of Lydia in their common sacrifices, with establishing of the power and jurisdiction of the Flamins , over both the persons and priviledges of the Subjects of the Nation: From these discourses onely at the first, they came at last to effects, insomuch as within a short time, small seeming sparkles of distaste, produced huge flames of discontent and rebellion, until in the end our Countreymen (as I may say bewitched with the perswasion of the now General Lycius ) not onely combined with some factious spirits in the Kingdom of Lydia it self, but led an Army into those parts under his command (most of the Nobility in the interim marching in some of his Troops) not alone to compel the King violently to condescend, to what conditions soever they should ask, but withal to force him presently to call together the great Senate, whereby as it was then pretended, the better to settle and compose differences between him and his Subjects, by which power it is well known to the world, he hath been since destroyed, accompanied by all his posterity, if it doth not please the Gods, again to restore them to their ancient right and titles: Upon this subject I might longer dilate, if the time of the night did not something prohibit my endeavours, although perhaps sufficiently known to you already: But if you please, I shall onely finish briefly the relations of what concerns this Noble Family: to which purpose our now Lord, finding in the general, multitudes of rebellions began daily to increase, as well here, as in other parts of the Kings Dominions, as also in particular, that his own Religion was proclaimed, to be most hateful to that new Government, which some Priests every where intended to form, and set up through the circumferences of both Nations (seemingly now united in the same intention) sending his eldest Son with a few other of his Children abroad, for the better security of their persons, intended himself to be exposed to the worst dangers could fall upon him, either for his manner of Worshipping the Gods, or in the Loyalty he had conserved inwardly to his Prince: But whilst my Master was considering the best way, how to put these worthy designs in execution, for the good of the King Euarchus , himself being perswaded, his personal presence might either something allay the fury of the people, or at leastwise win many of the Nobility to his party, came suddenly to Lampsacus , hoping as he said by that expedition, to render them satisfied in his affection: But the furies again (not being contented with those former differences and past discords of the Nation) caused many factious spirits to create new disorders, amongst the people of this Kingdom; insomuch as presently confusions of all sorts flew abroad through the Territories of our Prince; the Temples were assaulted, the Worship of the Gods depraved, and every dissolute person left to his own will to act what he pleased, either according to his sensual inclination, or his fantastical conceptions: O you Gods, with what a trembling reluctancy were these proceedings, entertained by all sorts of dispositions, that had not absolutely sold themselves to wickedness and destruction? This I must say made many, if not most of the Kings friends, who seemed to exclaim against these transactions and ingratitude, to be proceeded withal as enemies to the State: So that a Nobleman of greatest birth and authority in the Countrey, was publickly sacrificed as a hainous offender, onely for speaking some few words in the Kings defence; others again for their appearing good will concerning his rights and interest, were violently deprived of all their lands and subsistance: To be short my Master amongst the rest (whose religion and opinions belonging to the real Worship of the Gods, being a crime esteemed of the highest nature) was constrained to banish himself into this solitary desert, to avoid the better the distemper of the times; where he hath lived ever since with some security, notwithstanding he hath been often threatned for his fidelity: So that he not being able to perform those services he desireth, here he intends to remain, until he shall see either a change of affairs, or an expiration of his own life; contenting his thoughts, with the onely neighbourhood of some few of his poor tenants, who now and then (as far as they dare for fear of the anger of the factious Priests) assist him with those ordinary duties, belonging to the tenure of their several Farms; the most part of the rest of his estate being in the hands of the publick receivers of the Nation: For however he be given to understand, that Prince Arethusius our new King, is come into the Countrey with some hopes, of other dealing, then his Father received, by his Subjects of this Kingdom, nevertheless as yet my Lord will not appear in person before his presence, whereby to express any testimonies of his affection to his particulars, for that as he is informed, those of his Religion, and manner of Worship in the Temples, by agreement and publick decrees of the great Senate, must not be admitted either to his acceptance or entertainment: This Sir shall at present (with the time of the night proper for your repose) end my discourse; desiring also your favourable pardon, if already it hath been too tedious for your benefit and conveniency. Arethusius after he had thanked the Steward for his relation, he let him know, that the King had no such ill opinion of those persons, that professed the same Worship of the Gods with his honoured Lord and Master, although he was forced for the present to comply in that particular, with many things else with those, as he knew neither loved him nor his cause, however he did not remember, as he said, that the King had ever yielded to the publishing of any such decree: Some other discourses past between them of several natures, until the Candles waxing short, the Officer found it high time to recommend Arethusius to his necessary rest; wherefore calling in the servant (who had attended all that while in the next room) with some few complements took his leave, promising in the morning to be more serviceable to his desires, in what things he should be pleased farther to command. Prince Arethusius however he had had a subject given him for consideration, with those other adventures he had passed the day before, yet wearisomeness joyned with his youth, made him take his repose during the night season, without many perturbations either of minde or body; in which posture he continued until the early sun the next morning saluted his Chamber window; and being awake he called to remembrance, where he had left his Horse the evening before, that as it should seem till then, had been buried in the confusion both of his thoughts and entertainments: The sudden apprehension of this omission caused him presently to rise, and by chance finding one of the servants of the house in the Hall, he desired him to send some of the ordinary people of the Family in search of his Steed, which the night before, as he said, he had left tyed to an old shrub in the Woods belonging to the Forrest: The man promising him to be diligent in his pursuit, Arethusius returned again into his Chamber, intending there to remain, until the morning should be yet farther spent, conceiving it some kinde of discourtesie, any way to disquiet the repose of the ancient Lord before his accustomed hour: But whilst his thoughts were in a manner settled, to the consideration of many things belonging to his own affairs, and more especially reflecting upon the strange sight he had seen before in the woods, the Nobleman himself not unmindeful (according to his custom) to prevent the Suns rising in his timely devotions, hearing that Arethusius had been already out of his Lodging, came with courteous language, and a smiling countenance to his Chamber door, where gently knocking with a key he had in his hand, he not only gave him a kind and friendly good morrow, but within a while after asked him, whether his inclination were so given to walking or recreation, that he would accompany him two or three turns in his Garden, which perhaps might bring them either profit or delight, since however he should not finde pleasure enough therein to please his eye, wanting those stately curiosities belonging to other magnificent habitations; yet he doubted not, but that the air was so pure and searching, that it would mend their stomacks, towards the slender entertainment was to be expected in the Parlour at their dinner: Arethusius could not be displeased at any divertisement, that took up time, for that his horse being yet missing, he could not think of his departure, and therefore was the willinger to accept of the occasion, that might (almost upon what terms soever) procure a protraction. The Gardens themselves were cut out of the main Rock, into many descents one above the other, for that nature had not afforded a sufficient quantity of ground, (as it should seem) whereby to make any considerable plain for that purpose, which however, although it appeared for that reason, not much pleasing and delightful to the eye, yet it gave a certain commodity to the expectation, whereby to seek new varieties upon every winding and turning, as they by degrees mounted the steps; and that which gave the greatest beauty to the place was, many runlets of water distilling from the stones, or rather between them, being all received in one small Cistern, and so conveighed in a plentiful measure to divers parts of those solitary walks, as it were onely to create Fountains of several sorts, though rude and unpolished in the workmanship, besides trees here and there placed in knots and groves without order, that made the Garden in the whole, seem to be a kinde of a little though artificiall Forrest, ordained for the recreation of some Goddess, in her private retirements and contemplation: At the upper end of all the walks, near the top of the Hill, was a flat piece of ground of a reasonable capacity to exercise sports of sundry kindes, finely turfed with the fruitfullest soyl of the Forrest, the hue appearing both green and flourishing, which shewed that ordinary feet were not accustomed to trample (when they pleased) upon the verdure of that natural Carpet, however at the extremity thereof was raised a Bank, or rather a Tarras of four foot in height, supported by a low wall, composed of flint and brick together, and designed into several works, according to the pleasure, and unskilful fancy of those workmen, that either acted in part, or contrived the building, besides at each end thereof, was erected a small Banqueting house, covered with blew Slait, cut into the form of scollop shells: In the middle there was another Arbour, though differing in shape, yet much more exact to the view, appearing (as indeed it was) some Oratory or Temple belonging to the Gods particular Worship. To the first of these Banqueting-houses (being nearest those stairs they ascended) Arethusius the unknown King, was soon invited by the old Lord, who with that key he carried in his hand opened the door, when presently was discovered to his sight, many Bowes and Arrows, with other Engines belonging to hunting and a Forresters life, which weapons he told the Prince in his youth, he had made use of with more then ordinary passion; but now his years would not give him leave so frequently to enjoy that commodity, and therefore was content onely, to keep the Monuments of his active delights, instead of any longer putting them in much practice: from this place they went to the little Chappel, in which there stood an Altar furnished with many small statues of severall Gods and Goddesses: After that Arethusius had sufficiently viewed those curiosities, (for curiosities they might be very well called by his apprehension, since the use of Images had been a long time ago prohibited in all the Temples of the Lydian Government) he was told by Auguisius , (the Lord being so called) that this was the private Oratory, whereunto he daily resorted to perform his ordinary devotions, the pictures being a means to retain his minde attentive in his holy exercise, which custom was used in the Temple of Delphos . Arethusius being something taken with these observations, to which himself from his very infancy had never been brought up, and scarce heard of the practice before his journey into the Kingdom of Syria , began a little to question with the Lord concerning his opinions in Religion, differing so much as he said from the Myssian Rites; and more principally, for that he seemed to adore those statues as Gods, at leastwise so pretended by many Priests of the Nation: At this demand of the young Prince, Auguisius seemed to smile, believing that his information came either from ignorance or malice, and within a short while after made him this answer: As these allegations and objections, said he, are not the first delusions, with which the crafty and dissembling Priests of our Countrey, have couzened the thoughts and apprehension of the common people, whereby the better to work their own ends upon them, for their greater advantage, which hath partly outed the King from all his priviledges and Jurisdiction; so of the other side, give me leave to say, (as I told you at the first) that we use Images onely but to keep in our mindes and thoughts more attentive, and better fixed to our devotions, since the representation of persons, and actions by figures and similitudes, cannot but recollect our memories to those actions they did in their lives, withall to shew, what they were in goodness and sanctity, and so by consequence will be a means to enflame the more our desires, not onely to their admiration, but to their imitation; the one pious concerning the Gods honour, the other profitable towards our own happiness: However replied the Prince, this may be the intention of most, yet methinks the best attentiveness should be a certain strong inward apprehension, when as diversity of representations, do but instead of recollection, distract and perturbate the minde to several fancies, that carry people oftentimes from the very matter they intend, whereby to consider onely the circumstances, which perhaps are most delightful to nature, and better agreeing with humane appetites: As for example, if we desire to consider any thing deeply, we use to shut our eyes, for fear of beholding over many objects, that might be an occasion to unfix our thoughts from off the subject aimed at: 'Tis true, said the Lord, I must confess if once we had arrived to that period of sanctity, that we needed no helps to our frailty, we should perhaps enjoy such a forceable apprehension inwardly, that might be attentive enough in matters of devotion, meerly by fixing our thoughts upon the principal object; but as every person is not so recollected in spirit, but must be led thereunto by degrees and ordinary means, until a perfection be attained, so it is convenient, if not necessary to prevent distractions before they come, to set before our eyes something that may present unto our mindes, those examples we desire and intend to follow, which else might be diverted from our thoughts by multitudes of worldly fancies, most agreeing to nature and appetite; for the purpose, we are accustomed to put the heads of Traytors and Offenders, in some publick and remarkable place of horrour, whereby people might be deterred by such spectacles, to commit the like crimes, as it were continually renewing to their memories, the facts for which they suffered their punishments: Of the contrary, again you see Statues are erected to the honour of brave and worthy persons, whereby the vulgar may be animated to their imitation, beholding so lively the objects of their rewards, whose actions and deservings, would else in time perhaps be utterly forgotten amongst men, to the prejudice of verne and example: Besides, why do we place Images upon the Tombs of our dead Ancestors and Friends, keeping their Pictures as long as we can in our houses from age to age? But to conserve alwayes their similitudes and representations in the Family; and shall we be less just to those admirable persons, whom the Gods have not onely taken to themselves, in a perfect way of felicity and honour, but in some sort designed them in the world, whilst they here lived for our patterns and instruction? Wherefore more necessary still, to retain their memories in our company: So that I must conclude, those arguments to be most impertinent, if not altogether frivolous, that would destroy so beneficial a custom, at leastwise for the ignorant people, who cannot but suffer oftentimes multitudes of distractions in their ordinary devotions; when as we see triumphs are granted to brave and courageous Generals after Battles, as well to honour themselves, as to let the vulgar more plainly apprehend thereby, what was acted for the good and glory of a Commonwealth; books and stories are onely written, to keep noble proceedings fresher in memory for future ages, as the contrary to be in detestation with the world, they being no other then certain Images to the minde, as Pictures are to the eyes, both setting forth to the imagination as may be supposed, examples to be followed or avoided. However replied Arethusius , notwithstanding I might grant it to be true what you have alledged, that Images in some sort were a means to put people in remembrance of vertuous actions, and so by consequence do inflame mens mindes to the like imitation; yet you cannot deny, but when you adore them as that vertue it self, or as some do esteem them very Gods indeed, it is an impiety of the highest nature can be thought upon, to the derogation of all Divinity, with the real dishonour of the great God of Heaven, who is no doubt most precise and jealous of his own Worship upon earth: O you Gods, said Auguisius , who hath possest you with the strange and false opinions concerning our actions? When there is no capacity so gross and simple of our Religion, but being demanded the question, what they hold of Statues and Pictures, will readily return this answer, that they give no worship to the image, but in reference and relation to what it doth represent, according to the nature thereof? insomuch as for satisfaction they will be content to break or deface the Image, so it be not done with a spightful intention against the person it representeth; for in so doing, we cannot injure the Kings statue, without subjecting our selves to the penalties belonging to Treason, answerable to the Laws of most Nations; besides we are accustomed to give particular honour to his Chair of State, although himself be not in the Room, but absent at some far distance, which is the same worship we give to the Pictures of the Gods, however something in a higher degree, in regard they are more divine and venerable, having put off altogether the clothing of their humanity to all eternity. Many such like discourses and controversies brought them to the last building of the three: The place was arched underneath in the manner of a rude Grotto, the water issuing from the main Rock in divers small currents, with a kinde of a pleasant murmur, proper for contemplation and study, whilst the upper part of that solitude, was contrived into a convenient Library well furnished with Books and other materials belonging to Learning and Sciences, with sundry sorts, as Maps, and Globes, almost of all Countreys and Horizons: There was also a Couch-chair for repose, when either the heat of the weather procured the appetite, or the labour of the minde could not well suffer it self to be longer tyred, with the force and agitation of imagination: When they were entred into the room, Auguisius told the Prince, that these were his principal Recreations in his declining age, however in his youthful times, his exercises had been a great deal more active: But as he said, nature now could not be altogether resisted, and a certain kinde of necessity (being outed of every honourable employment in his Countrey, by reason of his Religion) made him think his condition yet something happy, that he could enjoy so innocent a liberty, notwithstanding the malice of many of his enemies, which scarce wisht him what content soever. Arethusius replied, that man was a world within himself, being not to be deprived of an inward felicity by any power or tyranny, if he proved not the destroyer thereof by his own passions; for the Gods gave sufficient for every persons content; either by a passive patience, or an active industry, to furnish out his dayes with honour and varieties: Some half an hours time, they continued viewing of petty rarities, and turning over many papers and books, until at last, ready to come away, the King espyed an old parchment writing, which taken in his hand, (the Lord in the interim being gone out of doors to perform some necessary office) the thing spoke this language in Meetre.  Acurst shall be the Missian fate, that lost A King betray'd to death, by his own best; Since strangers here must reign with blood and spoil, Punishing the people of this barren soyle: For pride, for perjury, for wicked gain; That caus'd the Gods to kindle such a flame, Which all must feel, and burn, from man to beast, Yet in the end must out of thraldom rest, When as a warlike youth, shall with his sword, Conquer anew, and govern by his word, Such contradicting spirits, that at first Brought plagues upon the Land, of penury and thirst, Until he see a peace to flourish wide, Through his vaste Territories, and here abide. Arethusius in his minde, comparing this writing, to those words delivered the day before in the Forrest by the wilde man, not onely made him something earnestly for the present study upon the business, but became absolutely confirmed in his thoughts, that the predictions concerned most his own particular, and therefore had a great desire to have remained longer upon the consideration; but in the interim, the old Lord Auguisius again entring the room, with an intention to invite him to some other divertisement; he was something diverted from his resolutions; the Prince notwithstanding having the parchment in his hand, with a kinde of a merry countenance, began to make this apology for himself. Sir, said he, presuming upon your goodness and courtesie, seeing I have made bold in your absence, with some of your writings, which however I must confess, leaves me as little satisfied, as if I had read nothing at all, rather perhaps proceeding from the weakness of my own understanding, then from the difficulty of the matter it relates; I must become a suppliant to you for the further expounding of the Text. Auguisius first smiling upon the King, and then taking him by the hand, desired him they might sit down together in the Couch-chair, in regard of his age, for that he had already as he said, past the uttermost bounds of his morning exercise, which being done, the Lord in a most serious manner used this discourse to Arethusius . Most gentle and noble Guest, said he, as perhaps writings of this nature, may seem to most persons but impertinent and frivolous stuff, in regard of their uncertainty in some kindes, yet considering both their antiquity when they were writ, (looking upon the character) and the many things that are already come to pass, not possible then to be forethought, we cannot but very well imagine the predictions themselves to have proceeded from some divine power, either acting or permitting; and so by consequence led us to a veneration or admiration of the intention; nay, put case they should be contrived or pronounced, but by the violence of infernal spirits, yet when they fall out to be true in the effects, we ought without question believe, they were so constrained to deliver the knowledge that was infused into them, or at least permitted to reveal what themselves have a minde should be divulged to the world, for the further satisfaction of mankinde, concerning the revolution of humane affairs: Of the contrary what can be gathered from the meer rules of Astrology, is altogether uncertain, as depending onely upon those conjunctions, that may fail in their operation, by some interposing accidents, if not in the punctual calculation of the time, by reason of misinformation in any part; for if Astronomers cannot alwayes hit right of the weather, that most depends upon natural causes, how is it possible Astrologers should be sure of future things, as I may say wholly belonging to Divinity? Since they may be altered and changed, both by accidents and heavenly decrees, according to the several subjects they are to work upon. But predictions pronounced by Oracles, are more settled and extraordinary, as intended to shew forth some matter necessary to be known, either for amendment of lives, or the punishment of crimes, whereby the like may be avoided or followed in other ages: This being granted, I may say, the writing that you have in your hand, hath not been onely reserved by my Ancestors and my self for many years, but the first part of it is evidently seen to be fulfilled, in the death and destruction of Euarchus our late King, with the present invasion of our Country, which is to be feared, may prove a ruine in the general of all Myssia ; so that not otherwise to be presumed but that the rest will follow in time and order; onely the defects of predictions are, lest they be either corrupted in the often transcribing them, (wherefore uncertain) or the termination of their effects, seldom to be understood before they come to pass, and so oftentimes prove of little or no benefit at all to the Reader. 'Tis true, with a small search I might produce, said he, many other old Papers of the like kinde; but as this will be more then sufficient for your present entertainment, since Youth is not accustomed to be delighted with difficult conjectures of this nature, so shall I end my discourse of this subject at the present, however with this assurance, that there is at this very time, many other things delivered concerning the fate of this Nation, by a certain kinde of wilde man; or rather a spirit living amongst these Woods, who seldom or never encountreth any person, but in the night season; yet leaveth his Prophesies written in green leaves, or upon the bark of old trees, as it should seem when the occasion or opportunity is offered: These words made the Prince not onely a little startle, at the sudden apprehension of his own adventure, but began exceedingly to blush with the very consideration, whether he should reveal to Auguisius what himself had met withall coming to his house? Yet at last he resolved to be entirely silent in that particular; as well for that his youth was unwilling then to be more troubled with conjectural imaginations, as that the time of the day would scarce allow any longer discourses, when rather his care was upon the finding of his horse, and his departure: So that both rising from their seats, they went presently towards the house, through the other part of the walks, which made it in a manner seem buried to the eye, being entred on the top by the onely conveyance of a pretty Gallery: Being there arrived, and so by consequence soon descending into the Parlour, it was not long before dinner was served upon the Table, where the same company as the night before attended the season: The chief discourse at meat being concerning the unexpected return of those persons, which had been employed in the search of the Kings Horse, he not knowing until then by the Stewards information, (having as it should seem broken his bridle, unwilling belike any farther to be captivated in his Masters absence) had strayed no body knew whither, amongst the uncertain passages of the Forrest. Scarce was the Table taken away, and the womans company retired out of the room into their own Chambers, but one of the servants whispered the old Lord in the car; not long after, there entred into the Parlour, a handsome young man about the age of eighteen, who presently was known by the company to be the Son of Auguisius , by his asking him his benediction, according to the custom of the Countrey: The expressions of content on either side lasted for some space, when Auguisius turning to Arethusius told him, that as he hoped this youth being newly come from his travels in forreign parts, would prove as loyal to his Prince, as his Father had been, so did he not doubt, but his experience gained by seeing other States and Empires had rendred him much more capable and fit for his service; so that if by his means, he could attain to so high an honour and preferment, as to carry the Kings shield after him, in the nature of one of his Esquires, he should hold it for an obligation not to be forgotten by all the Family: Arethusius when he had saluted the young Gentleman, with sufficient expressions of love and courtesie, he told the Father, that such a person might merit the best preferment, any Prince of the world could bestow upon him, and therefore he durst so far presume upon his own interest with his Master, that such a request should not be denied his particular. These and such like Complements past away the time, until a, Messenger from the young Ladies of the house the Lords Daughters, invited Parismenus (for so was their Brother called) to a new visit of his Sisters in their appartment, since they were unwilling their Father (especially being accompanied by a stranger) should be a witness of their several expressions of joy, towards their youthful Brother upon the first encounter: These entertainments lasted for almost all the afternoon, whilst in the interim Auguisius and Arethusius , spent their time also in other divertisements. The next morning very early, not onely those returned, who were sent to seek the Horse of Arethusius amongst the Woods, but also in their company Meliander and some other of the Court, who belike had encountered the fellows in the Forrest; scarce was the news of their arrival made known through the house, but Meliander was presently ushered up into the Kings Lodging: A few congratulations being past, Meliander putting the rest out of the Chamber, with some haste presently related this to the King; that the wicked Rebel Lycius , had both traiterously and cowardly lost the whole Myssian Army, to the power and forces of Hercrombrotus , before or near the walls of the City of Lampsacus: Arethusius however he seemed at the first amazed at this news, yet at the last raising himself from his bed, and holding his hands up to heaven, he thanked the Gods that by this defeat, his own integrity appeared as well as his enemies treasons: When Meliander had a little quieted the Kings passion, he advertised him also of the circumstances belonging to this destruction; and withal intimated, that as it would be necessary now for him, to take possession of that command, which Lycius had unworthily quitted, not having a heart, as he said, farther to prosecute the war, so should he endeavour himself with all expedition to raise new Troops, as well within that Forrest, as in other parts of the Countrey, addicted to the Royal Interest: This councel pleased well the Prince, whose youthfull courage and hopes elevated his thoughts almost to miracles: But the coming into the Chamber of the old Nobleman, and his Son Parismenus , for the present put off their communication, the Lord being extreamly violent to make some Apology, for the not knowing the Kings person, in his entertainments within that habitation: Arethusius whose nature was both courteous and affectionate, not onely soon excused all his proceedings in that nature, taking the fault wholly upon himself, as being altogether unwilling to be discovered by any in that posture, but assured him, he would receive Parismenus instantly into his nearest service and trust, and continue for ever his love and thankfulness to all the Family: Many dayes did not pass after these congratulations, before the Prince took his journey towards the City of Lampsacus , as Meliander did to the other parts of the Kingdom, whereby with more conveniency to leavy new Forces; although the King found those Troops belonging to Lycius Army, (that had escaped the slaughter) much scattered over the whole Countrey; by which means some difficulty was to get them together, yet by his own courage and industry, with the augmentation of those supplies which Meliander after some weeks, brought to his service, he began at last to form a competent number of Souldiers, fit as he thought to encounter the whole Lydian Forces: Nevertheless Hercrombrotus passing over the great River, that divides the Territory of Lampsacus , from the Northern parts of the rest of the Kingdom of Myssia , and marching farther amongst the hills, though upon what design not well understood, Arethusius doubting, lest some treason might incompass him of a sudden amongst the mountains, where neither his own courage, nor his Souldiers fidelity should appear, resolved to try his fortunes in Lydia it self; hoping withal in the absence of Hercrombrotus , (that fortunate and esteemed victorious General) the people would be more inclinable to his assistance: Besides he considered, that as his own Army consisting of several people, and so consequently subject to divers interests and affections, would probably better behave themselves in a strange Countrey of wealth and plenty, then in their own habitation, furnished generally with nothing but want and barrenness. These suppositions I say, made the young King of a sudden, leave Myssia , the Lydian Army being as he thought sufficiently ingaged, within the compass of Rocks and Rivers, not capable to do him much prejudice at his back, before he had taken possession of the greatest part of that Kingdom, he had most desire and appetite to enjoy: But as the Senate of Lydia fitting at Sardis , having quick intelligence of the Princes march, prepared in an instant, multitudes of armed troops to encounter his design; so the wealth of the great City of the Nation, seeming loath to be surprized by a barbarous Army of Myssians , sent out other Forces; besides Hercrombrotus himself, understanding by some hired Spies amongst the Souldiers, that Arethusius was undoubtedly gone into Lydia , of a sudden either changed his purpose of proceeding farther in the Countrey, or dissemblingly appeared to alter what he never intended at the first; insomuch as within a few dayes time, he followed the Prince close at the heels, whereby poor Arethusius found his Troops quickly in a manner encompassed about by many well furnished Armies: But however the gallent Prince was in this posture, not onely an object of misfortune, but a very subject prepared ready for destruction, and so consequently could not but entertain perplexities enough in his minde, yet his courage (which notwithstanding appeared invincible) after the assembling of his Souldiers together, caused him to make this undaunted speech to his whole Army. Though necessity, if not desperation, said he, may seem at present, to withhold our hopes from every part of this ungrateful Kingdom of Lydia , since the people appear as backward towards our assistance, as our enemies are numerous in opposition, yet let our fortitude and courage redeem us from the misfortune, with this apprehension and certainty; that if we had still staid in Myssia , we should have been imprisoned amongst Rocks and Mountains, where as now at the worst we have liberty to sell our lives in the open fields, at the best rate honour can require: If we gain the day, Crowns and Triumphs will attend both you and me; and losing that which we never had in a vertuous way, we do but something anticipate our fates, for an eternal memory of what we endeavoured to purchase gloriously: Though multitudes be set before our eyes, to hinder our passage to victory, yet have we hearts and hands, if not to destroy, at leastwise to encounter with disasters, since there cannot be a braver period expected in this world, then either to conquer with your King, or die for your honour; or what viler Character can be set upon a Nation, then to leave him in the field, or not to help your selves in your dangers? especially when your Captain offers to mix his blood with yours, towards the redemption of the whole Army now engaged, whereby again to recover that lost reputation, which the Myssians have forfeted of late by cowardliness and treason: Fear I must tell you, is a dying before death comes; and resolution doth scarce taste of it when it is present: No man is a slave but in his own apprehensions; for true valour cannot be conquered, though put never so much to the worst: Let not the prevailing fortunes of Hercrombrotus (grounded chiefly upon opinion) deprive us of those rights, which nature owes us as well by disposition as birth; since if we cannot obtain dominion in regard of the perverseness of our fates, we will despise the possession for a more glorious acquisition: The enjoyment of earthly things, is rather a sensuality then an essence, when as the hope of eternal fame, ought still to continue the worlds ambition. This being said, the Souldiers with one voice, seemed to cry up his bravery, which encouraged most of the Commanders to lead on their Troops, towards a fortified Town, the better there to attend the comming of the enemy. But however the youthful and gallant Oration of Arethusius , appeared to have raised the thoughts and courages of most of his Army, yet his friends perceived amongst the Troops, many malevolent aspects, tending either to treason or despair; which notwithstanding the Prince would not endure to understand, much less was there any time convenient to examine particulars of that nature, since Hercrombrotus the Lydian General came on with such a violent fury, as that Meliander had scarce space given him to range his souldiers, in a convenient order for resistance; nevertheless not to be backward either in his duty or diligence, with all possible haste he thus disposed of the Kings Army. The Town it self was seated upon the banks of a fair River, the Meadows and flowery fields of the one side, giving it beauty and commodity, as of the other part, the walls afforded the houses sufficient space, for Souldiers to walk the rounds, whereby the better to keep the place in a posture of defence, against the attempts and assault of the enemy: As Meliander gave the command of the City to one Lysander , a near Kinsman to old Lycius the Myssian General, who had sworn a perfect fidelity to the Kings service, so had he designed certain Troops, under his own direction, of the other side of the water, to keep the numerable leavies of the Senates forces, from coming too near the buildings, whereby to prejudice their defence in any kinde; in the interim also giving order to Lysander upon occasion, to supply him with souldiers in boats, if he should see the enemy, any way prevail against that part of the Army under his Command: But Arethusius whose courage could not be circumscribed, although his fortune might prove defective, chose with selected bands himself in person, to give the first charge to Hercrombrotus camp, some furlongs then distant from the Town. The gallant bravery that the Prince shewed in this resolution, cannot be exprest by the Language of an ordinary Pen, onely let it suffice to say, that attended by Parismenus , and some other of his trusty servants, with a violence that rather resembled a storm destinated for ruine and destruction, then any humane, much less passive valour for slaughter, he drove the Lydian Souldiers up to the very Walls and Ditches of their fortifications: Which Hercrombrotus perceiving with eyes, as it might be thought that sparkled out both shame and revenge at the same time, not onely upbraided his Troops cowardliness, that a young man almost already buried in his misfortunes, should by their basenesse overthrow that honour, (as he said) which for so many years they had got in the wars, to the hazzard of all the Senates felicity, but took presently a spear in his hand, mounting on horse- back, at the same instant, endeavoured to finde out the Prince, either for glory, or a chastisement. The King with his Sword drawn, accompanied by Parismenus his Esquire, was then chasing other companies into their securest places for their better safety, who like a flying Mars seemed to triumph both in blood and victory: No sooner had Arethusius espyed Hercrombrotus , but with a certain kinde of instinct of hatred, mixed with passion, he gave his horse both spurs and raines in a full and violent carreer, towards the place where he stood: Hercrombrotus quickly finding his meaning by his posture, not expecting any equality in the meeting, the Prince having onely his naked Sword in lieu of a Lance, putting presently his Spear in his Rest, encountered him with no other success then that he brake his staff up to the very handle upon Arethusius shield, which gave the General warning speedily, to draw out the weapon he had by his side, lest the no more then that difference, might have been repayed with the loss of his own life, since he knew, however the young King was made up as well of honour as courage, yet he doubted there would be found few complements of courtesie in his breast, as well in regard of his Father as himself: In this posture they continued, each striving to wound one another, the Prince with violence and passion, according to the apprehension of his injuries, however guided with a certain natural dexterity, the other with more caution and circumspection, as if his years had something cooled his valour, or moderated his haste, until Parismenus coming in suddenly from some other slaughters, and finding the King his master thus unexpectedly engaged in a single combat, not onely presently made a blow at Hercrombrotus , by which he became wounded in the thigh, but many Troops appearing of either side, there was no more opportunity left, to end the quarrel; especially for that Hercrombrotus presently retired with most of his Forces into his former fortifications, their intending not onely to binde up those few hurts which he had received, but to enquire farther after the success of the rest of the Army under his command: The Prince being thus deprived as he thought, both of his glory and his revenge, not onely animated his Souldiers, with violence to scale the walls of the Fort, but himself in person attempted to perform, even admirable, if not miraculous actions. But those within the rampers, kept him at some distance by their Darts and Arrows, until his brave horse being wounded unto death, he was forced in some sort to retire for the exchange of a new, which he borrowed for the present of one of his Bed-Chamber, named Lymerenus , who was slaughtered in the place, as a testimony of his fidelity to his master, to the no small grief and vexation of Arethusius , whose noble compassion was there expressed, as much as the season would permit, having no time to give him more formal Funerals, seeing himself, and so many other gallant persons were desperately engaged in a most unequal encounter; for multitudes had besieged all their appearing hopes and fortunes: Whilst the King was making some pause, whereby the better to renew his intention of assault, he became suddenly advertised by an express messenger, that Meliander on the other side the water, needed also a speedy supply to keep him from ruine, in that many Troops not before discovered, had by some stratagem transported themselves over the River: This intelligence gave quick wings, as well to the thoughts, as the courage of Arethusius , wherefore leaving Hercrombrotus enclosed in his fortification, he past many of his companies through the Gates of the City, wishing them to shut those again next the General of the Lydian Army in his absence, lest some advantage thereby might be taken towards the loss or prejudice of the Town, that had appeared so faithful in his service: When the young King with much haste and passion enough, was come to the Rivers side, thinking to pass over his Troops for Melianders rescue, by such Boats he had caused to be made, and commanded alwayes to attend ready for such an expedition, he found them all vanished from his service, notwithstanding he was informed, they had conveyed many Souldiers up the stream of the Senates Forces, which was the reason that Meliander was now unexpectedly assaulted with numerous companies: Though it was easily to be perceived by this disaster, that Lysander the Governour of the Town, had played the notorious traytor, yet Arethusius calling the Gods to the assistance of his cause, would have passed the deep stream, by the swimming of his horse, to have animated his followers to the like attempt; if he had not been hindred violently by some of his friends, with these perswasions; that however himself and few others of his company, might perhaps with difficulty escape the rage and swiftness of the waters, yet it was impossible notwithstanding, to bring a competent supply to Melianders occasions, since he seemed over-powered by multitudes of Souldiers, wherein his own person would undoubtedly fall into the same danger, without benefit either to him or his Army; however Arethusius was content at last to be over-ruled by this councel, yet beholding Meliander , and almost all his company either slaughtered or taken prisoners, he could not contain his excessive grief from bursting forth from his fair eyes, with such expressions, as made his followers also shed many tears, as well for their masters sorrow, as for the loss of such brave and faithful Souldiers; but time and their necessities would not suffer them to dwell long upon contemplation, since the Princes safety began now to be threatned in a high nature, as well in regard of Lysanders treason, as Hercrombrotus prevailing fortune: Some would have had their King presently to have taken his course by flight, in those general combustions, and not farther to expect the determination and success of the Battle, appearing now almost desperate to their hopes: Others thought it best in some small Bark or other, to steer his way down the quick stream of the River, where after some space he might again take land, and provide farther for his security. But Arethusius himself was so far from laying hold of any of these councels, that as he was resolved to see the uttermost period of the fight, so did he determine, as he had formerly promised, to dye combating in the company of his faithful and valiant Army; and with these thoughts armed as he was, he commanded his Troops to follow him into the Town, intending first to punish the traytor Lysander with his own hands, and then with his remaining Forces, to make head against Hercrombrotus the General: Upon his arrival within the walls of the loyal City, demanding for the Governour, he was not onely informed, that he had obscured himself for some hours, not having been seen of the people, since the surprizal of Melianders Camp (as a clear testimony of his intended guilt) but withal, that the enemy had newly entered part of the Town, by reason of a Chariot full of luggage, which had been willingly, as it was thought placed across the Gates, that hindered them from shutting; which advantage the Senates Forces took to become masters of the passage, by reason whereof they had got some entrance into the City, and now began to fortifie the place with all their power. Prince Arethusius grown almost desperate, with his own misfortunes and other treasons, hasted with his Sword drawn towards the port mentioned, where instead of being able to bring a profitable relief to his fighting Souldiers, that had been appointed for the Garrison, he found most of them either slaughtered by the enemy in the streets, or defending their lives out of the windows of the houses, nothing being to be seen, but blood, confusion, and destruction on the Myssian part, having neither people to supply their Troops, or officers to command those that were fighting: The King notwithstanding would not give over his intention of encountering with the enemy, so that at last meeting with Hercrombrotus attended by his own proper guard, he gave him such a daring charge, that as the General himself was heard to say, the young man deserved an Empire for his courage, so did he once more put him and his company to such a retreat, that fates might have been perswaded to some favour in his behalf, if the Gods and they being alike cruel, had not opposed his resolution: After his horse another time was killed under him, and himself slightly wounded, many of his trusty friends had the good fortune, to convey him out of the Town, notwithstanding the diligent search every where for his person: So that one whole night lodged him in a little Cottage under a mountain side, where the darkness of the Element, and the thickness of the Woods, sheltered him until the next morning, when at all the company endeavoured to take several wayes for their better safety, knowing the enemy at the present, to be imployed chiefly, either in the finishing or contemplation of their victories. Arethusius I say, onely attended by Parismenus , in regard his youth was not at all known in the Kingdom of Lydia , and not much more in the Countrey of Myssia , came at last after the whole dayes travel, to take up his lodging within an obscure thicket, where he doubted not but to be safe for the night season, not daring as yet to venture upon any Village or Town, until he should be better disguised for the purpose: The Prince in this solitary habitation, having cast his body under the shelter of a large tree, began more feelingly to reflect upon those misfortunate passages, which the heat of action, and the variety of consideration, had hitherunto something taken away from his apprehension: In these thoughts he called again to remembrance, as well the encounter he had with the wilde man in the Forrest, as the predictions the old Lord Auguisus had shewed him in his house, now as he verily believed, belonging to his own fate: This imagination, or rather might it be said a truth foretold, made him though in a soft language, utter these complaints to himself. O Arethusius, Arethusius said he, most unworthy and unfortunate Arethusius ; what though the fates had determined thy ruine, not to be contradicted by humane power, wherein consisted all thy hopes and prosperity, yet shouldest thou not have fled from the Battle, after having lost the day, without either thy own death, or thy enemies suppression, since honour ought to be esteemed of more value amongst Princes, then all the considerations of wordly dangers put together? But of the other side, to see thy friends slaughtered, and slaughtered near thy person without attempting their relief, is a sin the heavens can never pardon, unless they mean thereby, to reproach their own justice, goodness, and glory: With these words he began to lay violent hands upon his newly bound up wounds, being in a manner overcome by a kinde of desperate (though false) apprehension, which made him think in his necessary flight, he had committed some enormious crime, against both his honour and condition. These extravagancies made Parismenus (though a stranger in some sort to his person) by reason of his own youthful and bashful modesty, finding it full time to put some stop to these exasperated and desperate passions, rise suddenly from the place, where also he was laid under another tuft of trees; and with as much humility as befitted the distance of their qualities, used these perswasions towards his farther consolation and reproof. As the greatest magnanimity to be shewed, said he, most excellent Prince, is to bear well the adverse chances of fortune, victories and losses for the most part rather being accidents then certainties, though accompanied with never so high a courage and endeavour: So of the other part to resist the Gods decrees, by seeming to undertake impossible attempts, ought rather to be esteemed a madness in the general, if not in some sort an impious lunacy of humanity, then any vertue or true fortitude at all in what person soever. Upon these considerations, I beseech you Sir, but call to minde in your wonted and noble judgement, that if you had stayed longer in the conflict without hopes or probability, accompanied by infinite hazzard to your sacred person, either to be slaughtered or taken prisoner by your enemies, whose triumphs would have been your scorn, how the world would have blamed your rashness, whereas nothing now can be reproved, but the malignity of your Stars, that provided not better fortunes for your worth and dignity, however may perhaps yet reserve your condition for more glorious and profitable victories: wherefore with such an humility as becomes the duty of a Subject and Servant, let me beg of your wisdome, that instantly you put from your thoughts, these dangerous and desperate apprehensions, that serve for no other purpose, but to destroy those designs, that in time will make you both prosperous and famous by the Gods assistance; and rather advise with the help of this dark conveniency, how farther to prosecute our course, yet for your more lasting and intire safety, in which consists the happiness of so many people and Kingdoms, since the heavens no doubt if it be not your own fault, will keep that which is so precious in their sight, having already in a manner shewed a miracle, that you are escaped without being surprized, from those who sought your life or captivity, more violently then Lions or Tygers do either their prey or revenge. These discourses by little and little at last weaned the Prince, not onely from all his passion, but in some sort gave quiet to his wounds, and settledness to his apprensions; insomuch as both himself and Parismenus began to consider, which way they should travel for their more certain security. As the Prince told Parismenus , that his resolutions were to get over the Sea with all the expedition he could, for that he found all the people both of Myssia and Lydia unfaithful to his purpose, so was he not well informed (as he said) what Haven Town was next and most convenient to that effect. After that Parismenus had studied for some small space, he returned this answer to the King: Truly Sir, said he, although I finde my thoughts extreamly comforted, that you have been pleased to consider these necessary remedies, (profitable and honourable both for your self and others) yet perceiving your wounds, though no way dangerous, however needing something for the present of care if not indulgency, I conceive it not amiss for me to make first some travel amongst these Woods, as well to procure means for their commodity, as to learn better the coast of the Countrey, since otherwise, instead of an escape, you might fall into some ambuscado of the enemy, when you least suspect the peril. This counsel pleased well the King, he intending in the interim to walk the Forrest, whereby to finde a more convenient habitation for himself, and by some mark or other to return to the same place again, that Parismenus might be still certain of his abode. When it was morning, Parismenus having fully understood the Kings pleasure, and thereupon also both of them agreeing of names, signs, and other circumstances belonging to the journey, and their encountering again, he quickly saddled his horse, and began that voyage of enquiry, for further satisfaction, which he had proposed, leaving the Prince also to his own resolutions and adventures. Parismenus having travelled half the day, and not finding in that time the commodities he expected, resolved notwithstanding the agreement between himself and the King, by no means to go out of the compass of those Woods, for fear of discovery, a little to break that determination, whereby to try what favour or assistance, some neighbouring Village, might afford both his hopes and endeavours. To this purpose perceiving a gap fit to convey him into the high-way, he soon fell upon a path seemingly beaten, that undoubtedly as he thought directed its course, either to a well inhabited Village, or some more populous Town: But he had not rid an hours time towards his design, the Countrey then appearing altogether open and champion, but he might perceive afar off, the dust to arise with no small violence, wherefore standing still to be made more certain of the event, at last he discerned plainly, that it was no other then many horsemen riding towards him almost upon the spur: This unexpected prospect, put the young man into some amazement, finding fault now with his own rashness, that had so unadvisedly left the quiet security of the Woods, to seek out perhaps, not onely his own ruine, but in some sort thereby the danger of the Princes safety; however he resolved with himself, that no torments whatsoever, should make him confess one syllable of his masters person or concernments; not doubting but they were certain Troopers, which were commanded after the King from the Battle, to search and surprise him where they could: As it is not to be questioned, but that this accident gave perplexities sufficient, to the thoughts and apprehensions of poor Parismenus , so the Gods whether favouring his youth or Arethusius cause, made him quickly espy a certain hollow place in a Rock not far from him, resembling the mouth of some natural Cave: Wherefore presently apprehending the advantage, he soon alighted from his horse, pulling off both his Bridle and Saddle, and turned him loose into the open Fields to shift for himself, whilst he with his furniture made haste to that den, which he thought might preserve his person safe without any hazzard, since he supposed, what enemies soever they could be, would not be long passing by the hole. The Vault was also covered with some small rubbish of wood, which made it as it should seem, oftentimes a receptacle for Shepheards, and such like people dwelling there abouts at no great distance, the better to watch their Beasts, and other herds of Cattle, of several natures feeding: Not long after Parismenus was entered into the Cave, he found by reason of the darkness thereof, a brave conveniency answerable to his desires, where he intended to expect the farther event of the Troopers, without any danger towards his own discovery: About a quarter of an hours time brought the Souldiers, not onely to that station, but being either weary of travelling, or finding the commodity to answer with the hot season of the day, they forthwith in that very place made a stand, and presently descending from their horses, resolved there to take up their noon quarters: This being done, they fell to such provisions they had in their satchels, every one taking his seat according to his pleasure round about the Rock, during which space, Parismenus might here these and the like discourses, to proceed from both their lavish mirth and their vollible tongues. Some of them recounted many memorable passages that had hapned in the Battle, wherein they were not backward to commend and extoll their own valours; and not a few would needs be as valiant and industrious as their General himself, which now and then raised words against them, in the nature or next degree to quarrels, though all their seeming passions became quickly allayed, by the consideration of their officers, being present. In conclusion they said, if they could now take the young Prince, they would make him another example, like his Father to posterity, and afterward the Army should rule Lydia as it pleased; for neither the Gentry or Nobility, as they intimated, were to be trusted in either Kingdom, however they intended to continue still the authority of the Senate, but yet no longer then they complied also with the profit, and intentions of the Souldiers: But for crafty and cunning Argylius , they said, whose dissimulation had kept him safe as he thought in their opinions, they trusted him no more then the rest, which he should finde, when they had absolutely subdued all Myssia to their purposes, whither they were now going to that purpose: So that if he had the good fortune, to escape with some part of his estate and fortune, it might be esteemed a principal favour and indulgency, however they could not deny (as they confessed) but by his continual opposing of the King, they had more prosperously succeeded in their enterprizes; accompanied by much other stuff of this nature, which they uttered during the time of their short repast; until all of them falling asleep, they continued in that posture for almost an hours space. However during the interim of this slumber, one above the rest, being awake, something sooner then his fellows, had so far an appetite of curiosity, as walking round about the hill, at last he entered point blank into the very mouth of the Cave: it may be believed that this accident, did more then trouble the apprehensions of poor Parismenus , having before been an ear- witness of all their goodly discourse, tending so much to the honour and benefit of the King his Master, and those of his party and interest: Nevertheless he resolved to make use of his courage, since any kinde of fear as he thought, would soonest betray his person; wherefore retiring hastily into the innermost part of that natural Vault, he drew out the short Sword, hanging by his side, with an intention if he should perceive himself discovered, by the Souldiers intrusion, to make his life pay for the forfeiture, and afterward to defend the mouth of the Cave, with his best power against the rest, rather then to be taken prisoner in that blinde and narrow obscurity, basely without any resistance at all: But the Gods as it should seem, determined better of his purposes, for withdrawing himself, as I said, towards the farthest end of the Cave, he found a hollow place in the Rock, which absolutely defended him from being perceived by the Trooper; insomuch as the fellow again presently retiring, hearing without the chief Officer calling to Horse, Parismenus by this occasion, escaped that feared danger, that might have hapned to his prejudice: Notwithstanding Parismenus had thus happily as he thought, freed himself from that desperate hazzard, yet he was content to remain quiet in the Cave, for a quarter of an hours space towards his better security, hoping that in that interim the Souldiers would be at a distance far enough; so that the time being expired, he softly stole out of the hole, however casting his eyes several wayes about him (the Troopers then appearing all out of sight) he might see, that one of them had left behinde him a certain wallet full of some provision: This accident quickly put on his curiosity, to know the particulars contained in the bundle, which being unfolded, he found both provisions of meat, and materials fit for apparel: These things belike had been either gained in the Battle, or stoln from the possession of some honest Countrey people; nevertheless he resolved to make a little use of the accident, either for the Princes service, or his own advantage, since his present journey tended to nothing but to the like purposes: Wherefore again binding up the fardle, he began to search earnestly, what was become of his horse, whom by no means he could discover, notwithstanding the Countrey of the one side, was altogether champion for a very far distance; this put Parismenus in some perplexity again, however finding no remedy for the present, and not as yet daring to travel the Countrey, for that he supposed many Troopers would be abroad of the Senates party, almost in every Village, he resolved with all the speed he could, to return to the Prince, whereby not onely to make him acquainted with those adventures, he had passed, but in the night season, by the help of the Kings Horse, (having lost his own) he would fetch away the wallet, being well stored with provision, a thing they extreamly wanted towards their relief in their necessities: No sooner in this sort had Parismenus laid hold of this occasion, but carrying the Sack into the furthermost part of the Cave, he began his journey through the Woods, not at any great distance from the plain, towards the Prince whom he supposed, with some impatiency would expect his return: All that he could do being on foot, was to attain the place of his Masters abode an hour before night, where notwithstanding contrary to his expectation, he found him so changed in outward appearance, that scarce could his memory call to minde, that he had ever seen the same face before: for however Parismenus had himself cut off the Princes hair for his better disguise, which was a most excellent beauty, that nature had from his infancy bestowed upon him, yet besides the King had so disfigured his countenance, with many several patches, and an old perriwig he had got upon his head, that the alteration appeared much more then ordinary to his apprehension: Nevertheless after some time of admiration, wherein Prince Arethusius was pleased to jeast smiling at his own disguise, (though it was unpossible any way to obscure the goodliness of his stature) they fell to the recounting of their several adventures: When the King had heard from Parismenus , what had passed in the Cave, as also the intention and resolutions of the Souldiers, concerning his own particular, accompanied by the fates of the rest of the Nobility and Gentrey of both Kingdoms, which he imagined came from the opinion and discourses of their superiours, he told Parismenus also, that himself traversing the Woods, had met by chance with certain Milk-maids, belonging to an old Forrester, sometime a trusted servant to the King his Father: This title I must confess said he, gave me so much assurance in my thoughts of his fidelity, that presently having refreshed my self a little with their courtesies, I not onely enquired after his house, but quickly found it out; where instantly meeting with the party, I let him know, in a manner the whole truth of my fortunes, but what I was my self, desiring him that if any whit of his ancient loyalty remained in his breast, that he would assist me, and a certain other companion with his best help, both for the curing of some few wounds we had received in the Battle, as also to give us directions, how we might get out of the Countrey, to the nearest Haven Town, having an intention to quit this unfortunate region, with the safety (if it were possible) of our lives, since we expected no mercy: much less subsistance from our exasperated enemies: However if this request said I, seem any thing dangerous to your apprehension, I hope all the rules of gratitude and humanity in the world, will forbid you to betray us in our necessity: The good old man making a short pause, whilst the tears abundantly trickled down his aged cheeks, at last assured me, that however the ruine of his poor family might depend upon the success, yet was his faithful love to Euarchus and his posterity such, that we should not onely be welcome with all security in his house, during the curing of our wounds, but afterward he would use what means he could, to convey us over the Seas to some other place, whereby we might have subsistance, and he freed from the hazzard, and trouble of any persecution, for the present in the Kings cause: After I had acknowledged the favour, as a most singular obligation, both to our selves, and the Royal Party, and had also received other entertainments of refreshment, I let him know we would be ready, either that night or the next morning, to make use of his noble courtesie, since as yet my companion being absent, until I could finde him out in the Woods, where I had left him, I could not be certain of the time of my return, whereby to be made happy by the effects of that charity, which he had so kindely offered in our behalfs. To be short, some weeks Arethusius remained in the Forresters lodge, which time for the most part was imployed, in providing necessaries towards his further journey; Parismenus also caused new habits to be made of those materials, which he had found in the Troopers fardal, the Prince being himself unwilling to be seen much abroad, for fear of any unfortunate discovery, though his person was altogether unknown to his old Landlord, and so by consequence to all those of the family; however the old Huntsman, would often entertain him with discourses belonging to the King his Father: And after this manner, some whiles with extraordinary affection, he would seem to commend the nature and vertues of Euarchus , telling him in his hunting progresses, with what familiarity, he would talk with all sorts of people; but more especially, with those officers that appertained to his sports: Then again he shewed him many places near his house, where the King would sit and rest himself, after his hard labour, and toil in his recreations: He also told him, he was most excellently diligent and expert, in the chusing of his game, being up first in the morning of all his followers, to go out into the Forrest: Then would he turn his discourses into passions, concerning the Kings death, and the unnatural and ungrateful treasons and disloyalty of his own Subjects, both of the Kingdom of Lydia and Myssia ; cursing with deep imprecations, the authors of his destruction, when as at the same time almost, he would send up to heaven as many prayers and affectionate wishes for Arethusius prosperity, not suspecting he was so near himself, to be an ear witness of his love and good will to his particular. But when Prince Arethusius conceived he was sufficiently cured of the small hurts he had received in the Battle, and that Parismenus had provided those disguizes, and other necessaries fit for their journey, being perswaded that all the Troopers who were sent to interrupt the passages, or to look after persons suspected were at better quiet, they began then to think of their departure, notwithstanding they had been entertained at the Forresters house, with all the humanity and kindness could be devised: so that both of them being apparelled, the one after the nature of a young Huntsman, the other of a Scholler, one morning leading a couple of dainty Greyhounds in their hands, whereby the likelier to avoid all suspicion, they departed from the Lodge on foot, intending by easie journeyes to reach to some Haven upon the Eg aean Sea, with what conveniency they could, since their intentions, pretended more to safety then to haste; hoping ere long to finde some passage over into Grece , the nearest cut as they thought for transportation, because less subject to rovers, or to any of the Senates Forces: In this manner having travelled some dayes without either interruption or considerable adventures, at last they came to a large plain, in a manner environed with mountains, as one might say, equally divided between both Kingdoms by a running water, that was rather to be esteemed a Brook then a River; being there arrived, they perceived many Shepheards here and there, grasing their small, though innocent flocks, for want either of more means, or better breeding: To them at leastwise to one company, they went, whereby to spend some few hours in communication, as well to enquire out other news, that might instruct them in their journey, as a little to rest withal their wearied steps, during the time that Phoebus seemed overmuch to tyrannize over the earth: As soon as they approached to one of the Troops, having given them a courteous and gentle salute, Parismenus (whom for the most part the Prince put on to be spokes- man) told the Assembly, that as they had no intention to be farther troublesome to their society, then what should stand with their own conveniency, so of the other side, he hoped they could not think it amiss, to let them know that themselves were of the Countrey or Kingdom of Pontus , travelling at the present towards the Sea-side, with an intention to finde a convenient passage into Greece , the better there as he said, to practise their faculties of Hunting and Physick, for that their own Countrey being lately over-run by neighbouring Nations, they could promise no security to themselves, and less quiet in their several vocations: Truly replyed the seeming master of the company, after having stared upon them a while, you have then made an ill choice, since no region I think of Asia , hath tasted more lately of the misfortune of War, then this poor Kingdom of Myssia , where you now are; but yet nevertheless that we may not be thought altogether discourteous in our conversation, though never so unhappy in our fortunes, we do not onely desire you to sit down amongst us, a little to repose your selves, after (as we suppose) your tedious travels, but withal, we shall desire you to take a share of such fare as we have, it being now almost time for dinner: they presently thanked him for his courteous invitation; and when they had sufficiently tasted of such provisions as were amongst them, Arethusius being as well passionate to know something more of the Countrey, as to be directed in the way towards their future journey, began to ask him many questions concerning both; however more especially, of the Ports and Passages at Sea: As the fellow was loath to enter upon any discourses of this nature, whilst his other people were about him, either in regard of the hinderance of their services, or for fear of being held too great an intelligencer, so when all the Shepheards were dispersed into their several offices and imployments, staying himself onely with Arethusius and Parismenus , he entered upon this manner of relation, for their further satisfaction. Gentlemen said he, your countenances and comportments shewing you to be such, and of the best education also, according to my fancy and apprehension, in the first place you must know, that by reason of our late Wars in the Countrey, and the many accidents that have hapned, which hath bred more then suspicion enough amongst all sorts of people, all the Havens and Ports belonging to the Seas, are at present, strictly guarded by a vigilant watch, insomuch as it will be difficult for any man, to get passage without a particular examination, both of his person and his business: Next you may be informed, that however we are a people of a mean conversation, by reason of the trade we seem to drive, in the open Fields, feeding and pasturing onely Cattle, as well for a great Lord named Argylius , as for our selves, yet before the invasion of our Countrey by the Lydian Forces, we had not much cause to complain of our fortunes, since we had alwayes more then enough to keep us from necessities; and superfluities rather serve to nourish unquiet ambitions in mens thoughts, then contribute to the contented state of any condition: But as the Gods have been ever pleased to allow a competency, as the best portion towards humane satisfaction, so have the Souldiers taken part of that out of our expectation, for that not onely our possessions, but our very liberties seem to be at our enemies mercy: 'Tis true we may blame our Lord Argylius , who at first opposed his King with a needless resistance, for these threatning evils, that now invade our Countrey (a story too long at the present to particularize) but yet we hope his endeavours hereafter, may contribute, if not to an absolute redress, however to more loyalty, whereby in time things may be something amended: This great person I say, hath a half Sister near this place, whose flocks, upon the matter we feed and tend, who being either out of love with her Brothers actions, or minding a more absolute retirement in these times, hath confined her self to the circumference of certain Woods, for her pleasure or studies, to whom now and then we repair for her better recreation. The Lady as it is reported, hath some desire to visit the Countries of Greece , but whether to satisfie her curiosity, or to prevent further mischiefs, that might befall her person I cannot tell, onely that conveniency I think, might be most proper for your transportation, since it is to be supposed, the ports will not be denyed to any of her company. Arethusius being something inflamed at this intelligence, as well for that it seemed to his apprehension, that the Lady could be no other then Joyela , formerly mentioned by Meliander , as that by her means (as he thought) he might come to convey himself safely over the Seas, began a new to be inquisitive after her name and employment: To this the Herdsman presently answered, that as she was called from her birth the fair Joyela , so was her time for the most part spent in retirement, however, now and then she would use the recreation of Hunting, as he said, in her own Woods belonging to her dwelling, with the company of such Countrey people, as had a minde to repair thither, for the delight of the exercise, whereunto were appointed certain prizes to the Victors: This intelligence fitting well with Arethusius purposes, the Prince demanded, whether strangers were admitted into the society? And what were the rewards given to them, that any way exceeded in dexterity or cunning? The Fellow quickly perceived, at what period Arethusius aimed; wherefore with a kinde of an affectionate, or rather a courteous smile, made him this reply, conceiving him to be a young man, as well of a youthful ambition, as of a handsome personage: Gentleman, said he, I must confess, your Youth and Beauty cannot but expect entertainment in any assembly, and much more, where fair Ladies have government and influence: So that, the better to satisfie you in this particular, not onely all persons of what quality soever (being of any inclination to vertue and activity) are admitted to these general huntings, wherein he that first strikes the Beast, exposed to the Chase with his Spear, is to be principal Commander of the Woods for a certain time; but for the most part, every thirty dayes, there is a meeting appointed for this general Assembly, at which the Lady Joyela her self is seldom absent: I pray, said Arethusius , if my curiosity (or rather perhaps to be interpreted impertinency) may not seem too much to offend, after all the welcome of our kinde entertainment, when will be the next assembly of this nature? Truly replied the Officer, as I know not whether or no the troubles of our Countrey, will divert the intention, because concourses of people for the most part, breed unusual jealousies and suspitions, in the apprehensions of injurers and oppressours, so according to those intelligencies I have received, another day will be appointed within this fortnight, of which I shall give you more particular notice, if either you have a minde to try your skill, or that your occasions may permit you so long to remain in these parts. As Arethusius gave him much thanks for the kindness of his offer, with acknowledgement of his other courtesies and favour, so was he resolved (as he said) to seek out a convenient lodging with his companion, in some neighbouring Village thereabout, until the day mentioned for the general hunting should be past, since as yet there was so little probability of passage into Greece , by reason of the late troubles of the Countrey; from whence as often as he could, he promised again to repair to the same station, where he now was, to be better iuformed upon all occasion by his worthy and knowing conversation; intimating withall, that his own friend and companion in travels, would in the interim employ his time in the practice of Physick, it being a science, that he ever much delighted in from his infancy, concerning which art, both he and his fellow shepheards, should participate of freely, without either cost or trouble to themselves and purses. As Arethusius quickly found out an abode, in an obscure Village between two aspiring Mountains, within the circumference of that Territory, little frequented either by Souldiers, or neighbouring people, so Parismenus resolved once again to visit his Fathers habitation disguized as he was; there as well to enquire farther after the affairs of the Countrey, after the loss of the Battle, as the better by that means to inform the Prince his Master, whose active spirit could not yet be sufficiently satisfied to leave Myssia , without some action in his own person, if any probability or hopes remained for resistance: These intentions I say, carried away within a few dayes Parismenus from his Lords company, though not out of his service; whilst in the interim Arethusius attended with some impatiency, they day of summons, for the general meeting of youthful Huntsmen, to shew their dexterities before their fair Joyela , whither the chief Pastour promised to conduct him, upon the time appointed for the exercise. The day being come, the noble stranger apparelled in green, according to the custom of such employments, with a convenient and a handsome Spear in his hand, appeared amongst the rest of the society, upon an even plain, encompassed on every side for the most part with small rising hills, covered here and there with Copses and other Woods, wherein the wilde Beasts and other Cattle designed for the Chase usually lodged: At last the toyls were set, and several Engines prepared for their surprize, when the Lady Joyela her self soon appeared: She was also clothed in green, however over that colour she wore a Mantle of white Satten, fringed with Gold, and tyed on the top of her shoulder in a knot, after the manner of the ancient Nymphs: She had Buskins upon her legs, seamed with rowes of small Pearl, intermixt with divers several silks, her hair was breaded behinde her, with many Ribbands of the same livery, whilst the other part of it, flowed here and there, in a careless manner about her face, according to the pleasure of the inconstant winde, which nevertheless did no way seem to disparage her natural beauty; All this treasure was onely covered with a straw hat, answerable to the habits of other Countrey Maids of the Nation, though in many places for distinction, it was curiously wrought together by other materials, after the resemblance of Birds and pretty flowers: In this posture with a Bowe in her hand, and a Quiver hanging behinde her back, she approached the company, where with a countenance made up between a grave chearfulness, and a modest activity in her desires, she gave them all the good time of the day, wishing when they pleased to begin the sport, since she was resolved, as she said, onely with one Page, and an old Forrester, to attend the comming out of the game, upon that Plain where she then remained. No sooner was this direction given, but the Woods began to ring with several sorts of noises: In every part might be seen, the wilde Beasts fly for succour to the neighbouring Copses, though such as were more valiant seemed as it were, to oppose the fury of the Hounds, who appeared in many places to besiege them onely with their loud cries, instead of daring to adventure upon the combat: Others again that had got an absolute Victory over the fear of the lesser proye, were violent and precipitate in the pursuit, until they had brought them into the lawn, to be a delightfull object to the fair, though more discreet Joyela , who expected a convenient encounter for her own dexterity, as they passed by her station, until at last a white Bull, belike more furious then the rest, as it should seem inraged by the confused cries of the multitude; however forced to fly by reason of the Dogs eagerness, not onely traversed the field with a swift pace, but bent his course directly towards the Lady, who nevertheless being therewith nothing dismayed, discharged, though in vain many Darts and Arrows against his approach, since the discourteous, or rather inconsiderate beast nothing abated seemingly, either of his speed or intention, insomuch as Arethusius being already sufficiently heated with the sport, and no way backward of shewing his activity, amongst that rural company, (for true Courage never wants the effects, when the subject is present for demonstration) quickly on foot as he was, crossed as well his design as the field, when the Bull not being distant from the Lady about twenty paces, ready as it were to give her expectation a dangerous salute, the Prince of a sudden not onely interposed his person, but with his Spear so fortunately struck him in the breast, that his blood, if not his life, seemed to be at Joyela's mercy; so that presently stumbling with the encounter, he fell upon his knees, as it were to beg pardon for his intended offence, against so much beauty and honour; whilst in the interim Arethusius drawing out of his sword, (many other Huntsmen coming also into the Quarry) after a quarter of an hours time, they soon bereaved him of what power he formerly had to do more mischief, to the no small commendation of the young stranger, that for the present gave him an estimation, whereby not onely to make himself known to the Lady, but to be presented with the office (according to the custom) of the chief government of the Woods, for the next moneth ensuing: But Arethusius , whose intended period drived at other ends, refused the offer, conferring his right upon the old Forrester, belonging to Joyela , onely desiring for his recompence, some entertainment either in the Huntsmans house, or other where, until as he said, he could get free passage over the seas into Greece , whither he had designed his journey; who being a stranger of the Kingdom of Pontus , and hearing the late stopping of the ports, could not as yet be certain of the conveniency. The Lady Joyela her self, as well taken with his person, as having cause enough to admire his courage, understanding also upon farther enquiry, that her own Herdsman had brought him along with him to that dayes sport, she called her Servant unto her, and began to ask more particulars concerning his Name, Condition, and place of abode: The Herdsman told her, that his Name was Thusius , which the Prince belike had in that manner abreviated for his better concealment: And being a Gentleman of Pontus , was retired from his Countrey, by reason of the wars, with one other Companion, to finde more quiet and less oppression in the fruitful habitations of Greece , where they intended both, not onely in some sort to please their curiosities, but exercise their several vocations, without hinderance and disturbance: Notwithstanding the disguized King, in this manner obtained a reception in the old Huntsman house, the rather for that the Forresters Son was lately dead, and he unprovided of an Officer, the better to discharge his place and duty towards his Ladies service; yet circumspect and witty Joyela , conceived there was more nobleness concealed under that habit, then had been hitherunto discovered to vulgar eyes, wherefore resolved though for the present she said nothing to him, to be exactly inquisitive both of his intentions and condition: To that purpose not many dayes from this divertisement, the vertuous and most discreet Joyela , came again to her Keepers Lodge, not so much to solace her self in her wonted Recreations, (her Castle being at no far distance) as to enquire more particularly, concerning the young strangers quality and fortunes; whose person had exceedingly already delighted her view, as his carriage her reason; wherefore having for a pretty space reposed her self, the Forrester at that time being absent amongst the Woods, and onely Thusius remaining at home in the company of some ordinary servants) after she had a little questioned about his own employments, she willed him to follow her into a certain small Grove, something near the house, where she was accustomed oftentimes (with a book in her hand) to repose her self during the heat of the day; where being seated, after a while she used this discourse unto him. Gentle Huntsman, said she, as nature seems to have made you for better employments, then to be totally buried amongst Rocks and Mountains, so must you also pardon me, if I prove over inquisitive after your condition, as well for that I understand you are a stranger in these parts, as in regard the other day, you shewed so much vertue, both in my defence, and to the Assemblies content; towards which introduction, thus much I must tell you, that my Heardsman hath already informed me, that your desires are to pass into Greece , being a Native of the Countrey of Pontus , and from thence driven by the violence of war, which however makes me the more marvel, since according to my apprehension, your Youth and naturall activity, should rather have sought employments in those generous encounters, then have fled from the dangers at any rate; for that it is unpossible, but many of your friends, if not all your interest, cannot be but engaged in the severall fates of that unhappy Kingdom. Besides I must let you know, if my intrusions are not too great upon your concernments, I should be glad to be informed, what is become of your Companion in travels, which my servant said was with you, when you first appeared amongst the Shepheards of this Countrey; his absence being an occasion, which creates jealousies in our thoughts, that you are not what you seem to be indeed, but some spies sent to discover the weakness of our Nation, in these times of trouble and confusion, whereby to lay it open to more disasters and misfortunes, then as yet it hath any way suffered, by all those invasions our enemies the Lydians have made? But if you please to confess to me the truth of all these things, with the farther intention of your thoughts, I shall endeavour with all my power, in requital of that service, the other day I received at your hands, to free you from the danger of any surprize, during the time you shall remain in these parts; under the protection of the Forrest. Arethusius the concealed King of Myssia , being in a manner confounded by this sudden surprize, contrary to his expectation, did not know well what answer to return; sometimes his blushes seemed to accuse his innocency of too much guilt, in seeking to deny both his Titles and his Person: Then again his pale countenance betrayed a kinde of a fear in his apprehension, lest he might become discovered to his enemies knowledge and cruelty, being at the mercy of one of Argylius' Kindred, though the Ladies vertues had been formerly presented to him by Meliander , in a confiding posture; until at last he resolved (finding he could not be long silent without more suspition) to deliver himself in a doubtful way, feigning in this manner a story like his own. Most vertuous Lady, said he, not to conceal from you what I had a desire to hide, since I finde you have an inclination to be my confessor; you must know then, that in the Kingdoms of Pontus and Bythinia , not many years ago, there reigned a Prince, whose mildness and goodness was his own ruine, as his peoples misfortunes, proceeding from the ingratitude of their natures: since by the first he suffered, when he should have punished; and for the latter they are now become Captives, instead of continuing free: 'Tis true, this Prince a long time enjoyed a prosperous Government, appearingly blest from the Heavens, both in Wife and Posterity, until the Gods as it should seem anger'd at something, not known to Mortality, changed of a sudden the Scene, not onely to his disadvantage, but to the worlds wonder, for the multitude quarrelling with their own happiness, began tumults of disquiet without any known cause, when as their neighbouring principalities, underwent nothing but war and oppression: Neither can I say, that the Gentry or Nobility, were altogether free from this sin of inconstancy, against their own good, which now they repent bitterly, when the cure seems irreparable, having no power left either to redeem that loss, or continue what is remaining: This pernitions frailty, or rather I may say, madness of disposition, proceeded notwithstanding from some private ambitions, that put many on more to desire rewards, then to deserve preferments, when as it was well known he seldom refused advancement, (whether in place or honour) to those that had patience and worth sufficient, to merit favours at his hands, without the apparant injury of such, as had held Offices from himself or Father, by a long descent, purchased at first, with the experience of their trust and fidelity, to the service of the Commonwealth: But 'tis true, as covetousness and self-love have no bounds whereby to be limited, so passions or want of temper in seeking Fortunes, prove oftentimes the greatest impediments to Court acquisitions: I shall not trouble your ears with other conjectural reasons of his misfortunes with his Subjects miseries, since a bare relation of truths, will be sufficient to discharge my intention, and obey your comands: wherefore I shall desire you will be pleased to rest satisfied onely with the knowledge, that the first flaming fire of discontent, broke out publickly in in the Kingdom of Pontus , a Countrey as fruitful in rebellions, as in many places barren of productions; being farthest from Court, and so by consequence less warmed by the sun-shine of benefits, since the King onely lived in Bythinia ; a Territory that could best defend it self from surprize, wherefore more prepared for expostulation, and so began openly disorders to the view of the world: The Priests complained that the Gods services were adulterated; the people cried out, though by their procurements, that they enjoyed not those ancient priviledges, left them rightfully to inherit, by their long deceased predecessors: And the Nobility whose authority was then in most esteem alledged, their Princes absence in a manner rendred them all slaves, since Deputies did but couzen right, and enrich their own particulars, which were onely pretences, that rather shewed a way to their future intentions, then consisted either with truth or obedience; however I must needs say, they ought rather to have been prevented by quick execution, then by tedious and complying disputations, that onely encouraged those that had no minde to be pacified, and made others who were more real in their Loyalty, become doubtful in the success; insomuch, as it gave them more cause to fear for being too officious, then any way heartned their thoughts, to resist insurrections, newly now appearing in the Countrey, towards a fatal aspect: This seeming lenity with want of provident foresight, or rather as many wise men suspected, traitorous counsels being too prevalent, since a certain kinde of correspondency was noted at that time between the Court and the Rebels, caused the King to defer the bringing of an Army into the field, until they themselves were better provided then was expected, not onely to dispute with him at a distance, almost upon what tearms they pleased, but to bid him battle in the open campania, if he should chance to deny them any of those requests, they pretended to claim from his Royal Prerogative: At last their insolency flew to so high a pitch, whether grounding their confidence upon what they had already got in both Kingdoms, by reason of the unnecessary protraction, or the facility of the Kings nature towards their particular, that whilst he was even devising wayes in the most commodious manner to pardon them for their disaffections, they of Pontus brought numerous Souldiers to Bythinia it self, there to dispute their wills rather then their rights: Insomuch, as the poor King, being rather amazed at their ingratitude, then well provided to resist the Rebellion, finding also he was betrayed in most of his councels, not onely quickly gave them their own condition, but allowed them their demands also for all those of their party, and faction, in the Countrey of Bythinia , that until his very death he could never repair that breach which was made, but was forced to reign and govern after their wills and pleasure, as I may say, sacrificing according to their fancies, his greatest favourites and best servants; nevertheless this usurped liberty in time ingendred so much spleen and confusion in both Nations between several interests, some desiring a Prince, others none, that at last the unfortunate Kingdom of Pontus , being out-witted in their purposes, or over-powered in their strength, hath been lately invaded, and if not in a manner, utterly conquered by the Bythinians ; which makes us now see, the anger and justice of the immortall Gods, towards our indirect and pernitious proceedings, contracted by reason of our falshood and ill nature, shewed in the behalf of that Prince, whose vertues were unparallel'd, by Kings and Governours in former ages, which I may say are the motives, that have induced my Brother and my self to leave our Countrey, wherein at present remains scarce any thing, but the appearances of confusions, miseries, and famine, with a hope to finde either safer stations, or better employments in other Countreys, according to our several professions; where we are informed is to be found a plentiful harvest of all arts and curiosities, that can any way delight or satisfie humane nature. He was not gone much beyond this period, when the old Woodman, appearing upon them before they were aware, absolutely for that present, broke off the discourse, insomuch as every one instantly betook themselvs to other employments. Although the Lady Joyela , began to suspect the mystery of Thusius discourse, however as yet he had not finished the uttermost design of his relation, as she believed, nevertheless some weeks passed before she endeavoured again, to finde out the like conveniency; onely she continued towards him her wonted courtesie, until at last chusing one waiting Maid for her attendant, she took the occasion to repair to the same place in the Grove, about the time of the day, when Phebus declined something in his course towards the West, where sending for young Thusius , whilst her Gentlewoman took her recreation also in the neighbouring Copses, upon his arrival she wisht him, for her farther satisfaction, to make an end of that story, which he had formerly begun; however instead of any farther relation, he onely made her this answer. As I very well remember, said Thusius , the relations I made unto of the misfortunes of our Countrey, and the intentions of my self and Brother to travell into Greece , blest with the happiness of peace and security as we think; so may you be pleased to know, that those discourses if we had not been otherwise interrupted, could not have extended themselves to much farther periods, unless I should have trespassed too far upon your patience to my own disgrace, since there remained then nothing behinde, but some few trivial passages, not worth either my expedition or your attention, unless any thing were omitted, that the peevishness of my memory will not now suffer me to call to minde, for which I shall humbly beg your excuse: Joyela finding the young Prince, was loath to enter upon more particulars, although she began to be in a manner fully satisfied in her conceptions, thus spake unto him. Gentle Forrester, said she, as you have not yet given me any account, what is become of your Brother and Companion, since your abode in these parts, so must I again (as a mark of more principal note) ask you, whether or no your dead King (whom by consequences I believe to be so) left behinde him any Son, that perhaps by his valour and industry in time, would help the unwise people of your Countrey, to recover again their wonted liberties, as himself his own Crowns and Jurisdiction? Scarce had Joyela delivered thus much accompanied with a kinde of pretty jeasting smile, but a burning blush presently seized on the lovely cheeks of young Thusius , insomuch as his confusion gave the Lady not onely absolute knowledge, but more mirth, at leastwise so interpreted in the suspitious apprehension of the Prince: But finding that nothing but a certain recollected confidence, could disguize rather then call back, what he had already delivered, told her it was true; that the King mentioned, had left a Son, but what the destinies either had done by his person, or how they would yet comply with his fortunes, was not known when he parted from those Countreys to the people: To what an issue these discourses would have proceeded, cannot well be determined, since a great out-cry in the approaching Woods, called both Joyela and Thusius to other attentions; who presently making haste towards the place, from whence the noise came, at last they might see, not onely a woman lying flat upon the ground, in a large path, that had been cut out for some necessary passage, through the under Wood, but at a pretty distance a man combating with a great Bear: However Thusius made haste to take part of the sight, whereby the better to secure Joyela in her flight, towards her Keepers Lodge, yet being in his passage, interrupted by the party lying upon the earth, taking her up, he found it was no other then the Maid, that had waited upon the Lady Joyela , from the Castle, who as it should seem in her solitary perambulation, had been either assaulted, or onely affrighted by the Bear; notwithstanding he was forced to conduct her to her Mistress, that then had taken up her stand behinde the body of an old Tree, the Lodge belike appearing at too far distant for her retreat: When Thusius again was upon his way towards the combat, and coming near to the encounter, he might see the Bear, not only after a while much wounded by the combatant, but being arrived where they struggled together, he was distinctly advertised, that he who fought with the Beast, was his Servant and Esquire young Parismenus , newly returned from his progress of discovery, according to the appointment and directions of his Lord: This sight made the Prince quickly hasten to his assistance, the rather for that he found Parismenus , was both much tired and something hurt, in many places of his Body, as appeared by the blood upon his garments: In conclusion, the contention continued not long, for each of them assaulting the ugly creature, with a dexterous courage, not conceiving it any point of honour, to stand upon complements with that rude enemy, that knew no courtesie, and practised onely cruelty, he was soon dispatched to his last gasp, and afterward his head severed from the rest of his body, by those weapons they carried by their sides besides their Spears, as a certain kinde of Trophey of their intire victory. After they had a little accommodated themselves, from this violent discomposure, the Prince desired something to be satisfied by Parismenus , concerning the particulars of his journey, unto which he answered, that as he had pretermitted no diligence necessary belonging to his service, though he could not find any opportunity convenient to visit his Father as he had determined, by reason of multitudes of Souldiers, dispersed over the whole Countrey, so had he been certainly advertised in his voyage, that either most, or all the principal Nobility of the Kingdom of Myssia , were already by the Lydian Army secured in their own dwellings, or committed strictly to other Prisons, insomuch as no safety whatsoever was for the present to be expected in the Nation, for himself, or any of his party: Scarce had he delivered these words, but his own wounds, which he had received from the harsh embracements of the foul Bear, operated so far upon his youth and constitutions, that in the place he was ready to faint: However Arethusius was exceedingly troubled at the suddenness of the accident, yet at the instant both his Courage and good nature gave Parismenus necessities the best assistance he could, though his perplexity encreased, for that he knew not how to get him conveniently lodged that night, no Village as he thought being at any reasonable distance, and the uncomfortable woods would prove too prejudicial to his health and recovery. But as the Prince was much perturbated, between these considerations and his own diligence, of a sudden there appeared the old Huntsman, whom the Lady Joyela as it should seem not well satisfied in her minde, had sent from his own Lodge, more particularly, to enquire after the success of the adventure, after the fight that happened with the Bear: This good fortune (or rather might it be interpreted the wise charity of the vertuous Lady) brought a double benefit to the considerations of Arethusius : The one in helping him to administer remedies for the present to his maimed Servant: The other, for that he had some hopes to procure him lodging in his house, there to remain, at leastwise until other conveniencies could be in due time provided, for his more perfect cure and recovery. To this purpose they led Parismenus between them, Thusius carrying withall the Bears head under his arm, whilst they arrived at the Keepers Lodge, where they found Joyela attending, not willing belike to depart toward; her own home, untill such time she had received some intelligence concerning the fight: But being satisfied in her fearful curiosity, and understanding also who had been the instrument, that had probably saved her Maid from slaughter, commanding that Parismenus should want nothing belonging to the cure of his wounds, which appeared rather troublesome then dangerous, with a certain kinde of joy in her countenance for the escape, she returned to her own Castle, leaving the rest to be performed by the Officers of the House, however daily she intended to visit the sick Patient. When Joyela came into her own Lodgings, she could not chuse being alone, but a little to reflect upon the young Forresters discourse, which in a manner according to her apprehension, agreed with the present fate and fortunes, both of the old and new King of Myssia: These considerations fortified, by comparing Thusius persons and actions with what had been told her of the Beauty and Courage of Prince Arethusius , though now something obscured by his Huntsmans disguize, made her the more confident, she had him in her possession, especially when she looked back at the time of the loss of the Battle, and the comming of the two strangers into the Countrey, with their earnest desire of having the Ports opened, that they might have the opportunity, of speedily conveying themselves into the neighbouring Countrey of Greece: So that she was partly minded to communicate her apprehensions, with the opinion and knowledge of her old Nurse Rhea , whom however she had been put to her, by her Brother Argylius , yet long acquaintance as she thought, would make her trusty in that secret, as well as in all others of her own particular concernment; but when she considered the trust belonging to another, and not to herself, a Prince being therein concerned of so high a consequence, both in regard of his own person, and his friends interest, she utterly desisted from the entertainment of so hazzardable a fancy: In fine, reflecting upon what had been told her, that the young Prince from his Cradle was marked on his breast with a red impression of a natural Lion, she would yet prove that certainty by some means or other, before she either discovered her thoughts to any, or troubled her minde with more chymera's in that particular; and afterward consider better what was to be acted for his further service, since she found dangers of all sorts would belong to both their conditions, if either he should be interrupted in his passage, or to be taken by his enemies in his disguize. It was not many dayes after this resolution, ( Joyela having been one afternoon, to visit her wounded Patient Parismenus , who also had changed his name to Meros , and by reason of those frequent visits, had suckt the poyson of a dangerous love, into his youthful bosome, proceeding from the enchanted eyes of the fair Lady) that passing into the Woods according to her custom, for her more private and solitary recreation, she might behold lying under a tree fast asleep Thusius , the supposed young King of Myssia , and in so careless a posture, that in regard of his garment before being unbuttoned, for a little refreshment against the heat of the day, she had the opportunity easily if she pleased, without any discovery, to satisfie her own curiosity, in searching out the truth of the mark upon his breast, according to her former determinations. 'Tis true a little natural fear, or rather (might it be called) some kinde of reverence to his quality, caused her at the first with trembling steps, to approach the place where he lay, until her passions at last overcoming all her other considerations, kneeling down upon the ground, she gently removed from his breast the interposition, and as soon found what she either expected or looked for: O you Gods with what a countenance did she then entertain this verity: Sometimes she considered his person, and thought it now much more beautiful then before, being cloathed with glorious titles and attributes in her working imagination; which shews that opinion for the most part governs the thoughts and fancy of men, since the substance nor the form, were changed, but onely a kinde of inward apprehension no way visible to be distinguished, made or created onely the alteration: Then did she reflect again upon his fortunes, and disasters, wherein she seemed to blame the Heavens, both for their injustice, and cruelty, to suffer a Prince of such worth and of so high an extraction, to wander about the world thus in necessity, whilst others of meanest condition, possest all his rights and possessions, when as none of his own rank, seemed to lend a hand towards his assistance: With these thoughts she let fall a few of her own tears, as offered sacrifices to his injuries and misfortunes: But whether or no these inward expostulations of the fair Joyela , proceeded most from the effects of love or duty at that time, cannot well be determined? Since it was most certain, new inspirations began to seize the soul of that excellent Creature; insomuch, as presently returning home to her own Castle, without disturbing the accidental rest of the young Prince, she spent the whole night after, in nothing but distracted and violent considerations, tending either to her private affections, or charitable commiserations, belonging to Arethusius fortunes: Nevertheless so it happened, that Rhea her old Nurse (whether noting any thing from her Mistresses passions, or being over envious at the frequent visits, accompanied with the more particular conversation Joyela used towards her young Huntsman, since age for the most part is ever jealous, not to lose that interest they have with youth, whether gained by authority or love) one day finding an opportunity, thus uttered her minde to her Lady, either out of spight, or providence. The world hitherunto, said she, hath been so far perswaded of your vertues, (O most indiscreet Joyela ,) that scarce was there a match in all Asia , but would have been offered to your choice: Wherefore can it be thought a young strangers handsomeness, with a little fluentness in his tongue, should enchant totally your conversation from those former principles, given you by your trusty and long experienced Nurse? What may your great Brother think of our comportments, when he shall hear almost by every Shepheard, that your delights are either grown common, or your passions not to be supprest by any temper? If needs now you will marry contrary to your past professions, at least make such an election, as may stand with your honour and discretion, whereby neither your self or friends may suffer in reputation: Whilst Rhea was delivering of this preposterous and mad Rhetorick, that tasted rather of her jealous spleen, then of any circumspection which should have belonged to her age, however at other times she had often made Joyela weary of her insolent reprovements, grounded upon no better reason and consideration, many burning blushes with some tears of anger, might be seen strongly to combat in her modest and lovely countenance; insomuch as a long space it was before she returned her any answer at all, until at last (finding it was necessary to say something, as well in her own defence, as the better to shadow Arethusius disguise, since she could not deny in her own thoughts, but that a common Forresters frequent conversation, was a great deal below her own birth and calling) in some seeming passion, putting on in her looks, a new purchaste authority, she uttered with a kinde of a sharp tone this Language. Rhea , said she, although in this preposterous (if not malicious) discourse, your presumption hath far out-gone, either your discretion or affection, yet that you may be the better instructed in my intentions, and so by consequence judge of my actions, I will first put to your consideration, whether the youthful bravery of our strange Forrester, when he fixed his Javelin in the Bull, at the common hunting, by which means I became secured from the Beasts violence, and the ready courage both himself and his companion shewed, against the Bear ready to destroy my woman, be not motives sufficient to render me grateful to their worths and fortunes, although my own disposition should not be good enough, in some measure to require them with my countenance? which arguments, when you have well weighed in your judgement, though your nature should be never so defective, in that particular, I must farther tell you, that these young men who seems to be your spight, and perhaps the Countries envy, are not meer Vagabonds as you apprehend them to be, but great Lords of the Countrey of Pontus , driven out of their rightful possessions, by the violence of their prevailing enemies (that by the fortune of the Wars, and their own conquering Swords, keep now by force, what their lawful titles could not challenge) who are now travelling into Greece , but understanding all the Ports upon the Eg aean Seas to be stopped; are constrained under this disguise, to take up their shelter within our Quarters and Dominions: Now if gratitude, pitty, and good nature, would not contribute to such a charitable assistance, let the world judge, and the Gods punish? So that henceforth hold your peace, or speak with more reason; since I have revealed unto you a secret, which perhaps will be accounted a kinde of a false crime in me, to have discovered to any; with these words the anger'd Joyela flew out of the place, as if her youthful spleen, intended to get an absolute jurisdiction over her Governesses severity, since her choller and indignation seemed not again any way to be pacified, either by her endeavour or perswasion. Although Rhea might be a little frightned by this necessary passion of her Ladies, towards less malice, or more temper; yet Joyela finding it was almost impossible, long to conceal the Prince in her possession, since not onely the Countrey already enquired both after his person and vertues, but her own esteem and protection as she thought, would quickly become of no force, by the securing and imprisonment of the Nobility of Myssia , wherein her Brother Argylius bore a share in the disgrace, though not as yet altogether in the misfortune; because his manner was alwayes, to comply with the strongest party in appearance; wherefore began as well to consider the means of Arethusius escape, as her self also to be weary of her own habitation, in that she conceived, neither honour nor security would long depend, either upon her power, or her will in the place where she now remained, exercising her innocent sports and contemplation: Nevertheless she found some difficulty in removing; for that as the servant of Arethusius , was not yet recovered of those wounds, which he had lately received from the Bear in her maids defence; so was not her old nurse Rhea , in a capacity to be made acquainted with the reasons and intention of their escape, much less in person (in regard of her age) any way fit for a journey of that nature; and a kinde of an inhumanity it would seem to be, to leave her behinde, without either her consent or privity: On the other side, the young King himself, entertained no fewer distractions in his thoughts and imaginations, concerning his own desperate condition; considering that not onely all the Ports in the Kingdom of Myssia , were stopt against his flight, but Parismenus was now laid up for ought he knew, by a most tedious and lasting sickness; besides that he had lately revealed his adventures (though in something obscure terms) to the young Ladies apprehension, not knowing how far he could be confident of her goodness, since either her own private interest, or her Brothers power and ambition, might cause her in these extream times, to do things contrary to her nature and practice: Parismenus also though lying in his Bed, was as desperately afflicted in his minde, having received both outward and inward wonders: The one from the rude imbracements of the ugly Bear, the other from the modest and beautiful countenance of a fair Lady; which however of the two, according to his despairing apprehension, was the harder to be cured, being the chiefest cause (though none as yet suspected his thoughts) why his hurts, that appeared to the outward view no way dangerous, made so flow a progress in their amendment, however no skill or paine was omitted for his benefit. Whilst many disturbances possest the breasts of these three several persons, although in divers kindes, the old Governess Rhea , whether taking too deeply to heart, the late unkinde checks of her Lady and Mistress, the vertuous Joyela ; or that rather nature began of a sudden to lay a forcible claim to what could not be long kept from her right by any industry, fell extream sick of a violent burning Feaver: This unexpected accident put the Lady Joyela into another distraction, by reason as well she thought it would prove an impediment to her designs, as that it must necessarily draw together a dangerous concourse of people to that place, where it was convenient to be most private, in regard the old woman had been a long inhabitant of those parts, in belonging to her Brothers family: Besides she could not be but something sensible of her distempers, having continued with her a great space of her time, having been formerly a servant to her Mother, though lately as she knew, put over her concernments by Argylius ; wherein notwithstanding she had in some sort demeaned her self, more like a Mistress then an Observer; insomuch as she began to think; she should be forced either to leave her behinde, in what journey soever to be taken with the Prince, or be constrained too long a space to wait for her recovery, since she supposed at the best, her age would require protraction in her amendment; but the Gods within some few weeks, made end of these considerations, for the old Nurse at last growing desperate in her disease, one night when Joyela was inclinable to some rest, and to that purpose in her Bed fallen a sleep, she was suddenly called up by her Maid-servant, to take her final farewell of Rhea , who also in her slumbers had been frighted with some uncontroulable visions: This intelligence not onely renewed the perplexities of Joyela , whose nature was both pittiful and apprehensive, but made her haste quickly, either to perform her last office of kindness to her distressed Nurse, or else to make her self more certain of her condition, by her own personal and charitable visit: In this manner being arrived, and seated upon her Bed-side, after a few interchangeable tears between them both, at last this unexpected discourse proceeded from the old and distressed woman. The Gods said she, must be obeyed, and their inscrutable decrees will be observed, notwithstanding the frailty of mortality, contracted either into ignorance or stubbornness: These considerations and my own declining condition, makes me utter at present, what perhaps might be concealed to future prejudice: Know then said she; that as I am not ignorant, how Arethusius the young King of Myssia , is in a disguized shape entertained within your Keepers house, so is it necessary you provide quickly for his departure, lest the same sharpness of fight from others, prove a destruction to her person and affairs: This language did more then amaze the already too much distracted Joyela , who between her grief to finde her Nurse in so desperate a plight, and the suddenness of the surprize, to be called out of her Bed in the midst of her quiet, could not well know what to say, and as little how to think; especially when as the story now began so nearly to concern both her self and Arethusius : Nevertheless after a while, being better settled in her thoughts and apprehensions, whereby to attend a farther issue, Rhea again (though hathed in tears, and something interrupted by her sighs) in this manner proceeded. As I have already let you know (which it should seem you would not do me) that our neighbouring Woods contained this rich treasure, of so much consequence to be preserved, by all sorts of people within the Nation, so hath it been my endeavour privately, to keep you from setting your minde upon his love, noting a more then ordinary affection to his conversation; as well for that I knew the ambitious intentions of my Lord Argylius , to marry him to his own Daughter, whereby he might live still in a capacity of command, notwithstanding the opposition of any of the rest of the Nobility, as also in regard I received from the mouth of your Mother upon her death-bed, an admonition to keep you a Virgin as long as I could possible, in that by her predictions I found some ill fate would attend your marriage: But whether her thoughts were, that you should dedicate your chastity to the vestal Nuns, or to the service of other Gods, I will not say, onely I must tell you, that being not so faithful to her conjurations, as I ought in that particular, since I was afraid Argylius fury would have revenged my perswasions in that nature, as having an intention to make advantage both of your person and estate, besides his inveterate malice towards all those of the Delphius opinions. I thought it now something necessary, to make you acquainted with all these revelations before my death, as well in some sort to expiate my own crimes, as to let you understand the reasons of my bold reproof not many weeks since; which having delivered to your consideration. I shall more quietly depart to my eternal home. The distractedness of Joyela's countenance at these relations, shewed as she was past all confidence of Rhea's recovery, so was she in doubt something of the integrity of her meaning; insomuch as without any reply at all, she stood still more like a marble Image, then any earthly Creature, until the old woman (both noting her silence and her posture) told her, that for a further confirmation of that truth which she had delivered, she wisht her to take the small Key that was tyed in a string about her wrist, and open her Cabinet standing in her Chamber, where she would finde a more certain testimony of her words, from the own hand-writing of her Mother: Joyela , after a little pause, (making the inquisition with some search among other things) she hit upon a paper rolled up together, that spake this language, with the inscription on the back-side.  A Virgin must she keep, this God doth tell, Until some other persons counsel well; Lest Storms at Sea, and Land, destroy a Flame, That not from Nature, but Religion came: At wise Minerva's Altars must she bow, And new Devotions in her Service shew. Fain would Joyela have had at that time, other expostulations with her old Nurse about many particulars, both concerning her self and Prince Arethusius ; but finding her scarce capable of more discourse, and the Physician, and other company coming at the same time into the room, she was constrained to desist then from her purpose: All the next day the young Lady was troubled in her minde with diversity of thoughts, as well what might be the meaning of the Oracle concerning her own fortunes; as how far Rhea had discovered the abode and entertainment of the King in those Woods, to some other persons besides her self, which she conceived to be a matter of the greatest consequence to them both: But however, her indulgent fancy at last became confident enough, that nothing had been revealed to any to that purpose, in regard that neither the Nurse in her discourse, had made mention of such a thing, nor appearing effects had followed the Princes concealment, which would scarce have been prevented by accident or fortune, if the leaft notice thereof had been given to what trust soever, yet she rightly supposed, it was impossible long to conceal his person in that manner, without danger if not apprehension: In the next place she considered her own condition, as well that the power of Argylius her Brother now could scarce protect himself, and so by consequence none of his friends and kindred, as that the Oracle seemed to direct her course besides her own inclinations, to travel into forreign parts, and therefore resolved to quit the unfortunate Kingdom of Myssia , since the enemy had almost over-run the whole Countrey. Nor was there wanting in her thoughts some sparkles of love, at leastwise liking towards the young Prince, where by a heroical act of transporting him in her company over the Seas, the benefit as she believed could never be forgotten, either by himself or the World; and his protection would be the surer, rather by going in a womans company then alone: Such were either her fancies or her considerations, which she determined with all expedition to impart unto him: But however these were her resolutions, yet the sudden death of her old Nurse, protracted a while the execution, in regard of the necessary solemnization of her Funerals, whither were invited most of the Countrey people in that neighbourhood, where Joyela her self after some prayers made, with a great Taper of white Wax in her hand, gave the first fire to the prepared piles, accompanied with a general procession of Shepheards and Forresters. This Ceremony being ended, one day according to her custom, coming to visit the not yet recovered Parismenus , who rather languished in his cure, by reason of her beauty, then his own hurts, also finding Arethusius in the room, she wisht him to accompany her again into the next approaching Grove, where being seated, after some few circumstances to usher in her intended discourse, she thus spake unto him. My Lord said she, for so I must now needs call you, seeing it is no more time to dissemble, since our whole Countrey is not onely lost to our enemies power, but private searches will daily follow, either to suppress your friends, or surprize your person; when the greatness of Argylius interest, (although he were never so loyal) can no longer keep this place in my possession: Arethusius apprehending these words, with some amazement (for however he did not understand their meaning, yet sounded they suspicious enough to his hearing) stood still with a kinde of distractedness in his countenance; which the vertuous Joyela perceiving, with pretty smiles apprehending his confusion, thus continued her discourse. It is sufficient said she, that I know you to be Arethusius the Lydian Prince, and our present King; but by what marks I shall not need to relate, when the essence of the thing, is already so fully related to your ears: If the honour and fidelities that have hitherunto kept you safe in these parts, may make you yet confident of my truth and assistance, let not your royal thoughts be perturbated with new fears, for that I am resolved, to sacrifice my life to the worst death, rather then you shall want any services may further your escape. Nevertheless, if you have thought of better courses for your preservation, my prayers onely shall fervently attend you to the period of your purposes; if otherwise, perhaps a womans skill may accompany you in the voyage, to the next Sea Port where you shall best procure passage, either into Greece or some other parts of the world, as the Gods shall be pleased to secure you from danger: Arethusius having received as good a testimony to make him absolutely confident in her vertues, as he had by her words direct assurances of his discovery, less distracted then before, he returued her this language. Most excellent Joyela said he, as well the worlds wonder as my preservation; if an unfortunate Prince shall never be able to repay the obligations, due to so high and faithful a magnanimity, the Gods I hope, both for their own goodness and peoples satisfaction, will not suffer the example to be lost to posterity. The heat of these complements being past, they began more nearly to consider, the way and manner of their escape, which however, without any determinate resolutions parted them again, to avoid too much suspicion to their several affairs, intending another meeting ere it were long, whereby absolutely to contrive the rest; for notwithstanding the death of Rhea had taken off some part of the impediment, in that she was by that means eternally disposed of, yet the sickness that still continued upon young Parismenus Arethusius servant, whom he was very loath to leave behinde him, put some distractions in the resolutions of the Prince: but within a few dayes that obstruction was also removed; for Arethusius finding with some more diligent enquiry, that the youths distempers proceeded most from the darts discharged, by the bright and lovely eyes of the fair Joyelu , although the Lady was never made acquainted with the mystery, told Parismenus not onely of the journey, which shortly he intended to make, for the procuring his own safety, the whole Countrey being now in the possession of their enemy, but that Joyela her self also was resolved to go along with them, as a willing companion of their fortunes: Parismenus conceiving by this means some hopes to his purposes, within a week or two recovered his perfect health, insomuch as he became capable of that service, or any other wherein he should be imployed; nothing speaking more forcible language then love in a youthful bosome, even oftentimes to the performing of miracles in the opinion of others. Although it was concluded by them all three, to quit the Kingdom of Myssia with the first conveniency, Joyela in the interim intending to make use of a former pass, which she had procured from her Brother the Lord Argylius , when he was in power and prosperity, though belonging to other persons, whose names to that purpose might easily be altered according to her pleasure, yet the young Lady also the better to colour her design, with those of her own family and houshold, told her Steward privately, how that her intentions were to visit the Dodonian Oracle, near the City of Pergame , as well to be resolved concerning doubts of her own in matters of Religion, whereby the Gods might be more punctually observed, and the future fate of her Countrey known and discovered, as also religiously to perform the dying request of her old Nurse, who by an oath had enjoyned her to that pilgrimage: Withal she let him know, that as to this effect when she was gone, he might satisfie the rest of her servants and friends, upon any enquiry that should be made in her particular, so was she resolved onely to take in her company the young strangers, in regard the Countrey being now possest by Lydian Souldiers, they would be of less suspicion in the enemies thoughts, then other people of more eminency of the Nation; and her own disguise thereby probably would be the better undiscovered, if any inquisition should be made, either after their persons or affairs, whereas if she were constrained to travel with servants known to be any way belonging to the jurisdiction of her Brother Argylius , it were almost unpossible (as she said) to avoid the inconveniency of interruption in her holy and religious intendments: When the day was come, for these noble though desperate travellours to take their journey; the Lady her self was cloathed after the Phrygian manner, whereby the better to dissemble, both her quality and person in her own Countrey, through which she was to pass, as a party however not of the best, yet not of the meanest condition; since Arethusius designed his industry to wait upon her as his Mistress, who also had changed his habit to another of a more rustick form, whilst Parismenus was to journey it on foot, either by their horses sides, or to meet them every night where they lodged, as a necessary officer belonging to the Stable: The two horses whereon Arethusius and Joyela were to be mounted, before the break of day were conducted by love-diligent Parismenus , under the shelter of a small Wood, about a mile or thereabout from the Castle: It was an easie matter to see, how much the passion of affection transcended the obligation of duty, since Joyela became his care, and in a manner his onely observance, neither had the neglected Prince any thing to plead for his servants seeming alteration, but the willing change of his own condition, at which apprehension (however) he would often smile to himself. In this posture many furlongs they travelled together, without any considerable adventure, towards the great and ancient Town of Pergame , beyond which lay a pretty Haven, that as yet according to their hopes, was governed by certain officers belonging to the jurisdiction of Argylius , where they doubted not, but by the Pass shewed under his Hand and Seal, that Joyela had wittily contrived her purpose, though belonging to other persons, to finde a ready transportation (without either interruption or much examination) over to the neighbouring Countrey of Greece , where they believed they should be safe, for what other intendments soever: But the way being tedious, and some entertainment necessary to pass the time more insensibly, Joyela began this discourse to the Prince, either believing her own Religion exacted the duty, or willing to try Arethusius opinions in those particulars. Sir said she, as you see what hazzards we are likely to pass, for the safety of your Royal Person, upon which also depends, not onely the good of your friends, but the restoration of these ancient Kingdoms, to their former prosperity and liberty; so of the other side, I cannot but a little fear, left the Gods offended something with our hypocrisie, in that we make the visiting of their Oracles, the colour of our journey, should in some sort or other punish the abuse; wherefore my opinion is, that when we shall be happily freed from all other dangers, and safely arrived in Greece , you propose to your resolutions, a determination of seeing also the City of Delphos , where the best truths certainly are learned, both for Religion and Morality; which in part will help to expiate other sins and offences, contracted either out of frailty or design: Arethusius not so much wondering at the discourses of Joyela , since he had been informed by Meliander , concerning the manner of her breeding from her infancy; but his youthful thoughts, being neither given much to confide in strict principles, nor was his education any way acquainted with the mysteries of the Delphin Religion, wherefore he quickly returned her this answer. O Joyela , said he, how comes it to pass, that you who are Sister to Argylius , whose opinions and actions, are onely governed by the wills and dictates of the rigid Priests of your Nation? should not onely your self be of a contrary faith; as you now seem by your words to intimate, but that you invite me to the entertainment of those superstitions, which you know, neither my Father, or the people of Lydia , have practised for this many years; and if any such resolution should be known to my Subjects, it would be a great means to keep me still out of the possession of my Kingdoms, then all the fortunes and victories of my enemy Hercrombrotus , with the malice of the Senate and its party, who now so violently prosecute both my life and destruction. Truly replyed Joyela , it is apparent to my apprehension, by that little reading I have had in History, that those points of Religion now generally practised in the Countrey of Lydia , were first invented, at leastwise imposed upon the unwilling obedience of the Subjects, onely to keep the Crown sure to the possession of the old Queen that then reigned, who as it was supposed more doubted the right of her Title, then was any way convinced in her opinions, in matters of Religious Duties; and more evident, that in this latter age, both your Father and your self have suffered all your injuries and oppressions, by some of those violent professours, wherein scarce any cruelties, or extortions have been omitted, either to compass fortunes, or revenge spleens; insomuch as I begin to doubt, whether the Gods any longer will protect these Nations from utter ruine, unless a timely repentance prevent future judgements: Besides it is to be observed, that the common people every where, are so given to their own appetites and sensuality, with a certain kinde of general confusion in the practice of their formal Religion, that it is unpossible any observation at all can be long used, when Priests as well as people, are alike wicked and preposterous. I cannot deny replyed Arethusius , but that the times are carried on with a most violent precipitation of pride and covetousness, not onely towards the prosperity of our family, but even against the very Fundamental Principles of all Divinity and Morality, which are the chief ties to piece together Government and Obedience, yet nevertheless, the foolish wickedness of men cannot make void, what is rightly established for the Gods service, and therefore their actions ought not alter our belief: In this, said Joyela consists the mystery of the dispute, between the Temple of Delphos , and those that profess the contrary opinions: For the first pretends to maintain inviolably, the same practice was instituted without any alteration, in the beginning; witness so many Records and Books written in all ages to that purpose, neither to be denied for their antiquity, or to be questioned in their interpretation, whereas of the contrary your people, onely believe and put in practise, either what the late Priest Herenzius (being discontented with his shame and punishment) hath told them, or their own fancies (grounded upon nothing but covetous and wordly principles) dictates to their appetites, whereby those of that Religion, become disobedient to their superiours, and extort from other people what goods they please, to their own use and commodity; not observing the least justice or charity in their proceedings: whereas the chiefest Law the Gods have ordained to be observed is, to do to another in all things, what they could wish should be done to themselves in particular: Besides it is to be considered, as an evident and indoubtable truth since the first appearing of Herenzius , in the Confines of Arabia , the world hath been filled in a manner with nothing but Slaughters, Rebellions, and Impiety, altering their opinions (at leastwise the exercise of their Rites) as often as the Moon doth her Garment, which want of constancy shews, that it is impossible the Gods have ever established a Religion so wavering, being by nature both certain and eternal in their institutions: These arguments of Joyela appeared to the young Prince, of more then ordinary consequence; yet not being willing to give over-much entertainment to their motives, in regard as he believed his concernments, depended something upon people of those principles in Religion, in whose assistance he hoped probably to regain his lost Crowns, which his own establishment in Government, endeavoured for the present, to put off any further disputation of this nature: For as he was unable to answer her reasons, so was he loath altogether to be confounded by her discourses, and therefore desired to convert the communication, into more pleasant and familiar talk; telling her to that purpose, that he feared her Religious Philosophy, had partly made her forget their design, in giving him so often names of respect, whereas now he was onely to be esteemed her most humble and obsequious servant, for the better safety and advantage of them both: But Joyela notwithstanding the Princes craft, was determined not so easily-to quit the Gods interest, as well as his conversion if it were possible; and therefore again added this speech, and some examples to her former discourse: However said she, my Lord, or Thusius , (whether of both you are best pleased to be named by) I finde you partly ashamed, to interchange too many words with a womans arguments, since perhaps you think it no mastery to become victorious against such an enemy, yet you must give me leave before I make an end, to say this to your consideration, That it is improbable the reformation pretended of the Delphin abuses, can be right from those of your Religion, who apparently have put the others out of their ancient possession, when as the world hath ever since grown worse and worse, instead of mending in their practices; whereby it appears, the effects have not followed conducing to the Gods honour, in that neither Temples have been builded, or charity increased; but rather those that were, are utterly destroyed and pulled down, with such a general current used of extortion, malice and injustice, that it is unpossible almost the natural succession of mankinde can subsist, unless there be speedily some alterations in the proceeding: Besides let me tell you said she, that however you may be opinionated, that many people of those opinions in Religion, remain still constant and firm to your party, both in the Kingdom of Lydia and Myssia , yet am I confident, your prosperity shall never arrive to you according to your wishes, unless the Princes of a contrary faith (by an united Forces) endeavour also strongly your satisfaction in the future: So that in the interim, it were not amiss for you to consult with the sacred Oracle of Delphos , what might be the event of your after proceedings, since that Arch-Flamin hath the best opportunity, both to perswade and joyn other States together for your advantage: If this advice said she, be too boldly offered to your consideration, I humbly beg your pardon, as a duty I conceived necessary in some sort, to be proposed to your thoughts; wherefore I may challenge a little forgiveness: but if you shall judge my intentions any way treasonable, I will not refuse what punishment you may prescribe, either in my sex or condition, in expiation of my ignorant offence; who cannot inwardly wish you what inconveniency soever, although I may appear of a contrary opinion to your thoughts in these particulars: however Arethusius wondered how Joyela could come to this knowledge of his affairs, as well in the Kingdom of Lydia , as of her own Countrey of Myssia , for that most certain it was, scarce any of his party, appeared ready willing to assist him, upon his last expedition, yet nevertheless (in his thoughts) he resolved not to visit the Temple of Delphos as she had propounded, although he intended not to make any acquainted with his purposes; onely for the present (being desirous to put off this manner of discourse) he returned her this answer of his acknowledgement and gratitude. O most vertuour and gentle Joyela said he, whose wisdom is equal to thy goodness, and thy goodness not to be parallel'd by any other creature upon the face of the earth, what a supream mercy did the immortal Gods shew in my behalf, when they first made me happy, not onely with the protection, but the affections of the most beautiful and discreet Joyela , I not thinking it was possible, that the barren soil of Myssia , or much less the house or family of Argylius , could have produced a plant of so much worth and excellency. These kinde of discourses, with some other adventures not worth the mentioning, brought them at last to the City of Pergame , where being arrived, and Parismenus having provided necessary accommodation for their stay, until they could enquire out conveniency for their passage into Greece , as they had determined, they were informed that the little Haven Town formerly under the sole jurisdiction of Argylius , was not onely lately possessed by the Lydian Forces, but all his officers that were accustomed to command the place, were newly turned out from that power, by the absolute direction of the Senate sitting at Sardis ; as well to prevent the transportation of suspected persons, as to give the greater authority to the Souldiers proceedings in Hercrombrotus Army, whereby their design, of making use of that pass the Lady Joyela had brought with her became wholly frustrated: O you Gods, with what an inward vexation did the young Prince entertain these apprehended disasters: sometimes he complained that the Heavens were not onely envious to his fortunes and prosperity, but even sought a spightful way to bereave him both of his life and honour; or at the best, to cast him into such a captivity, as was most hateful to mortality; in delivering his person over to the pleasure and triumphs of his insulting enemies, whose cruelty had no bounds as he imagined, no more then their breeding civility, to comply passionately with the unhappy fates of an injur'd Prince: But however these were the thoughts of poor Arethusius , yet Parismenus seemed most sensible of his own love; and to that purpose was grieved to think this interruption, would be a means to hinder the prosecution of his affection; in comparison of which, he neither thought upon future captivity, or present loss of life: Nevertheless Joyela whose passion (as it should seem) were more temperate, if not a womans invention to be preferred before a mans judgement in sudden exegencies, quickly told the Prince, that as there was now no time left to dwell upon tedious consideration, since probably a strict inquiry would be made after the occasions of their abode, so was it as she thought their best conveniency with all possible haste, to quit the Town, and travel farther into the Kingdom of Lydia towards Smyrna ; a City as she conceived, would give them a freer passage to their designs, as well for that it lay also upon the Egean Sea, as that there might be found less suspicion in the mindes of the people, for that none would suppose, he durst venture any more in that Countrey, where he had not onely lost the Battle, but was escaped already with much difficulty, from the violent prosecution of his enemies; which was the less to be doubted (as she said) in regard there was so long a space past, since the defeat received, who being all disguised in Phrygian habits, no officer probably would much examine, either their persons or their intentions: Besides said she, there is no likelier a way to avoid a suspicion, then resolutely to out face the jealousie, or the cause by being nearest, where and from whence it might proceed. No sooner was this design mentioned by the most fair and discreet Joyela , but it was readily entertained by the Princes apprehension, as the likeliest means to get passage into the neighbouring Countrey of Greece: Neither was Parismenus backward in contributing of his best service; for however his body might be something tired (as he thought in the prosecuting of so tedious a journey on foot) yet could his inward hopes be never wearied, concerning his lovely and beauteous Mistress, though his affections were altogether concealed from her knowledge and suspition: When the time came for their departure, not above two dayes from the resolution, they all three began to travel towards Smyrna: 'Tis true, no adventures happened in the voyage, but that often they were interrupted by inquisitive Souldiers, or other magistrates whose desire to be in employment, rather made them officious, then that any cause appeared to their judgements to render them so busie: All which notwithstanding was quickly answered, by their telling them confidently, they were onely people, of the lesser Phrygia , going towards the Island of Chios , where for the present some of their friends remained, and not being able by reason of the strictness of the guard lately set upon all the Sea-Coasts between them and home, were perswaded to go to Smyrna , to try if they could there procure a better freedom: This resolution they took the rather as they said, for that they understood the passage from thence would be much shorter; which handsome tale, gave in some sort a ready discharge both to their persons and desires; insomuch, as fourteen dayes at last brought them safely to the ancient Town and Haven of Smyrna , where being arrived, they took up their lodging in an ordinary house not far from the sea-side, concealing as much as they could both their money and other Jewels, which they had secretly provided and packed up for their expences, both in and after the journey, aforehand forecast, before their departure out of Myssia: But whilst this youthfull company, were enquiring in a manner every hour, after a conveniency for their transportation, their thoughts upon the matter being wholly employed in these passions, since fear and hope are the greatest disturbers of tranquility, Arethusius one night performing some servile office in the kitchin, the better to conceal his person, and fortifie his disguise, they might hear one winding a horn in the street, whereat the Prince presently starting up, and going to the door, he was advertised by the people, that it was onely a Poast, newly arrived from the great City of Sardis , who brought as they believed some intelligence of an extraordinary consequence, since he earned the marks thereof upon his breast, according to the customs of Lydia in that behalf: Thusius seeming something earnest in his countenance, to know what the matter should be, proceeding as it might be thought from a curious desire of novelty, the Master of the Inn at the same time being present, and probably no less willing to be satisfied then himself, told him with a little patience, accompanied by some respite, he would endeavour to know, not onely the cause of his arrival, but the very truth and particular of his business; so that presently making no stay, he went down to the Poast-house, not far removed from his own dwelling, though in another street leading to the water-side: However haste was promised, yet it was far in the night before the Hoast returned, during which time, both Thusius and Joyela (the Ladies name being also changed into Jola ) expected a satisfaction with some impatiency, since they conceived nothing could come extraordinary from the great City of Lydia , but of necessity must belong to their present affairs, as well as to the future succession of the Kingdom. 'Tis true, however the party himself went to bed, as belike having too much played the good fellow amongst his Companions during the enquiry, yet this intelligence the disguized Prince got from his Wife, not onely how the Senate of Lydia had been lately invaded and dissolved by the directions and power of the Souldiers of the Army, but also Hercrombrotus , was newly ordained by the chief Commanders, great Governour and Commander in their places, who now was to be proclaimed to that purpose, as well in the City of Smyrna , as all other parts within the Lydian Territory; which being effected, the Messenger was to pass further into Crete , as also to the directors of the Navy, to try their affections in like manner, to this sudden change and alteration of Government: O you Gods, with what pleasing inward passions, did Arethusius entertain this intelligence, since he hoped the instability of things, would of necessity at last bring him to his Rights and Jurisdiction; for that diseases in a State are never more demonstrated, then by inconstancy and often alterations, which shews that either Magistrates or People, are not sufficiently satisfied with what already they enjoy and the ancient way of ruling, (being not possible as he thought) to be amended by any other invention, he doubted not, but all sorts of conditions after a while (especially when tired with mutability if not faction) would return to their old obedience, without much labour or trouble; but again he began to have some appetites of fear, lest what had been reported were not true; however in that he was quickly quieted, by the generality of the rumour the next morning, when as scarce was there a Boy in the streets, but had their mouthes full of the report; and to adde more to the certainty they generally in the Town began to sing with a world of derision, the ridiculous downfall of the Senate, that had for some time prospered in their insolency and tyranny: Yet for all this content, which Arethusius took in the very contemplation of the accident, and the hopes of a benefit thereby, nevertheless when he considered (and consideration often produceth doubts) that Hercrombrotus , being quietly settled in the Government, would more resemble the ancient Monarchy of the Nation, people might be so well pleased, that they had not totally lost the form, that rather then begin a new war onely upon the rightfulness of the titles, when other essential points answered their expectation, they would be sufficiently satisfied to change their Governour, so they might still keep the Government: But however many of these apprehensions, thwarted the thoughts of young Arethusius in a short space, yet at last his hopes got the victory over his doubts; insomuch as the day being something spent, he carried his joyfull intelligence up to the Chamber of the fair Joyela ; who having been a little distempered by her journey, was then reading in a book, the story of the wars between the Giants and the Gods, with the success of their several fates, intermixt also by some other rebellions of divers natures. After he had shut the door (being most scrupulous, lest any of the house should be privy, either to his passions or interest, which had made him keep the greater distance with his Mistress, (as he called Joyela ) ever since their arrival at Smyrna ) he joyfully told her all the news: As the intelligence did a little amaze the young Lady, having not heard thereof before, yet being by the circumstances sufficiently satisfied of the truth in the general, they resolved both during their necessary stay in Lydia , not to enquire more of any person whatsoever after other particulars, lest it might bring a needless suspition upon their persons; either of having some interest formerly in the quarrel, or being now concerned in the change, notwithstanding they professed themselves to be of another Countrey, being withall resolved to take sea upon the first opportunity, lest any unfortunate stop should come contrary to their expectations, which they supposed might easily happen; and the rather in regard of the late alterations; so that having in this manner determined of their thoughts, Arethusius retired to his own appartment, not far off the place where the horses remained. Not many dayes after this resolution, did they continue in the City of Smyrna , when agreeing with a Ship-man of Chios , to transport them into that Island, where they doubted not within a short time, but to finde out another passage for what place they pleased to be carried unto, though the party himself was onely a Lydian by birth; yet in the evening appointed, for the putting to Sea, the season appearing both fair and calm, they were suddenly stopped by the searchers of the Town; and however they quickly bought off the strictness of their enquiry, by a large proportion of Gold, yet upon Arethusius entering into the Bark, the owner of the Vessel privately whispering Parismenus in the ear, gave him to understand, that he knew the Prince, and could not as he said without the danger and hazzard of his life, but reveal the secret to some Officer or other: It cannot be doubted, but these words put Parismenus into a great deal of confusion and amazement, as suspecting his truth of the shipman, and fearing the event of the accident, when as the Kings honour, if not his life, became thus unexpectedly engaged: Nevertheless the Gods as it should seem, inspiring him with more then an ordinary courage and resolution, at the present he returned this answer to the Boat-man. 'Tis true, said he, as I will not dispute the probability of your suspition, since the interruption of the journey onely, will be a sufficient misfortune to our affairs, so of the other side, give me leave to deliver these thoughts to your consideration: Whether supposing the certainty of what you have said? it be not better for your particular, to pass us thus undiscovered with the gain almost of any preferment you shall desire, in recompence of the service in forreign parts, our qualities not possible to be known to any but your self, since the searchers are already parted from the Bark, or lose absolutely the hopes of such a reward, by performing the most basest Treason, can any way be committed by mankinde, against a Prince who notwithstanding might live to punish you for the perfidiousness: Besides, can you think, after such an act of wickedness committed against innocency, either to be bountifully rewarded by whosoever in these confused changes, since none will so much own the treason as hate the Traytor, or be able again to put to sea, with what commodities soever of a considerable value, without the endangering both of them in your company, and your own person by forreign States; over and above the many private plots and designs, to take away your life by such of the Kings party, as are at present and will be continually living in other Countreys. The fellow after these words of Parismenus , stood for some pretty space in some seeming muse, until at last turning from him with a violence, as if his consideration had brought forth a determinate resolution, though at all he uttered not his minde unto him, he commanded his Marriners presently to hoyse up their sails, which quickly carried the Vessel with a prosperous blast, two or three furlongs from the shore into the sea, where she appeared to be past danger, either of the Town of Smyrna , or the Countrey of Lydia . As this escape well pleased that youthful and innocent Company, the whole passage being related at large by faithful though love-sick Parismenus , so for almost a night and a day they seemed exceedingly to be favoured by Neptunes best indulgency, since the waves rather played gently with the sides of the ship, then either made war against her tacklings, or drove her over hastily from the sight of the Asian Coast: Nevertheless determining to land upon that part which looks to the Countrey of Greece , as being more commodiously furnished with Havens to that purpose, they again anchored in that Road, by reason the night drew on apace, intending in the morning to be surer of their entrance: But whether the Gods of the sea being angry with their chief Master, or that Arethusius fates had a minde yet to lead him into other adventures, as not being fully satisfied with his past troubles, the windes in the middle of the night turned so contrary and boisterous, that the Shipman not having time to weigh up his Anchors, was forced for the security of his Bark, and the safety of the Goods and Passengers to cut all his Cables, letting her take her fortune, notwithstanding the danger of so many small Islands, dispersed every where in those seas: As this unexpected storm put them all into a new combustion, so Joyela who had not been much accustomed to those churlish tossings of the water, began after a while to be extream sick, insomuch as the violence of the windes still increasing, which carried the Vessel they knew not whither, gave Arethusius as well as the rest more then ordinary trouble; until at last the young Lady being in a mannner overcome by her distemper, began to vomit blood in the place of other superfluities, that had for some hours defended her from danger: 'Tis true, the Prince became outrageous at these chances, as well for the hinderance of their designs, as more especially in regard of Joyela's (as he believed) desperate malady, finding no relaxation in the effects of her distempers, though the president was not ordinary, for any person of what constitution soever to suffer in that kind; but it should seem some inward vein in her body was broke by her excessive straining. The perplexities of Parismenus on the other side were not to be expressed, for love now began to be laid open in a full prospect, despair encreasing the flame to a high violence, of tearing his hair, and beating his breast without any compassion: Yet the Gods as it should seem more favourable then they expected, after some hours time it being now perfect day, quieted the windes to the extraordinary content of most of the ship, though Joyela still laboured in her distempers, however something abated from their first fury. In conclusion Phebus beginning now to appear in his wonted glory and splendour, the Pilot quickly found they were within the sight of the Grecian shore: So that the Barks course still lying that way, as if resolute for those Coasts, having also lost all her Anchors, and most of her tackling, the Master determined to put into a Haven, not far from the great and glorious City of Athens , over against which they then were, where he intended to stay, until he had fitted his Vessel for a further Voyage, being now utterly unabled to that purpose. After this resolution was taken, they made what haste they could to the Grecian shore; sometimes by the meer force of rowing with their Oars; other whiles again they labored with broken sails to mend their Vessels speed, lest night once more should prevent their design, and so consequently indanger all their safeties: In this manner, between rowing, working, and steering, they arrived at Pirea the Haven of the great City, toward the shutting in of the evening, where being at last landed, though with some trouble, but more circumstance, the first thing that Arethusius and Parismenus did, was to provide a convenient lodging for the fair though too much distempered Joyela , which being effected, and she laid in her bed, by the help of the woman-servants of the house, the Prince went to the Shipman, to give him a full recompence, not onely for his own transportation, but in regard of his particular fidelity, in having his King at his mercy, as he said, yet notwithstanding had kept him safe from his enemies, when as extraordinary gain might seem to have invited him to such a determination: However the fellow was abundantly satisfied with his reward, and more that it had been his fate in this manner, to preserve both the life and honour of the King of Myssia , yet he humbly intreated the secret might not be revealed, as well in that the discovery would for ever hinder all his employments, upon any coasts belonging to the Lydian Power, as also in regard it would indanger the servants and friends he had, yet remaining within those Territories and Jurisdictions: Arethusius did faithfully promise him the performance of what he so discreetly required, as also resolved himself in like manner to disguise his own person, during the time he should continue in the Countreys of Greece , which as he believed, depended much upon the perfect recovery of the vertuous Joyela: 'Tis true the young Lady, however she wanted neither Courage to support her own malady, or lacked skilful Artists from Athens to cure her distempers, yet finding her sickness made but a small progress towards amendment, in the place where she now remained, was perswaded to retire unto a Cloister of Religious Nuns, belonging to the famous Goddess Minerva , who were accustomed (as 'twas said besides their busie devotions) to take care of diseased persons; especially of those of the better sort of people, which by accident were fallen into any manner of disorders, as a most laudable property appertaining to their order, in regard of the Mistress they served, being not onely Patroness of the City, but the heavenly inspirer of Arts and Skill into most professions. This design being proposed, as a conveniency well suiting with all their occasions, it was soon entertained by the willing consent of the young Lady, which also gave a further liberty to the Prince and Parismenus , to follow what recreations they pleased, towards their divertisements, since as Arethusius was resolved not to part from Greece , until he saw the determination of Joyela's sickness, so could not he or any man else be admitted in the Cloister to make a visit to her. The Prince being thus (as I said) freed in some sort from his attendance, though still tied to a voluntary observance, upon the present indispositions of his dear Joyela , whom as he was perswaded had left both friends and Countrey, onely to wait the conveniencies of his safety, began as well to consider how he should dispose of himself, during the time of her recovery, as in what posture he should put his person for the better disguise, since he was resolved not to be known to any whosoever, that he was the unfortunate King of the Myssians , not onely in regard he wanted in particular both means and attendance, but also for that he had promised the Lydian Shipman, absolutely to conceal his quality, during his abode in the Countrey of Greece: To this purpose in the first place, he determined to please his curiosity in viewing most of the famous Towns in Peloponenses ; as also to that effect, to take upon him the habit of one of the Priests, belonging to some Temple of Hercules , for his better disguise, supposing it was the properest vestment, as well in respect of his youthful determinations, as for that the chiefest Jurisdiction appertaining to the Arch Flamin of Delphos , under whose command such garments did most suit, both with the respect of the people, and his own travels, would give him more convenient entrance into all the places of note within the whole Countrey. It is not to be doubted, but that poor Parismenus , could well have been content of any occasion to have diverted his own journey, whereby to have attended the onely expectation of Joyela's recovery: But duty and honour would not agree to so unnecessary a vanity, wherefore he followed his Royal Master in his expedition, until they arrived at the Town of Corinth ; a Town whose greatness (although the first in Greece ) did not seem any way to their view to exceed its beauty. The streets were large and even, the Temples so fair and magnificently adorned every where with high Cupelo's , that as the Heavens appeared in a manner frighted with their ambition, so did the earth enjoy a commodity by their richness; wherein the people adored the Gods, as if they had been placed upon their Thrones, not by mental speculation onely, as in other Cities: Those gallant fountains, that poured out continually to the Inhabitants whole Rivers of clearest water, were designed in stately and large Market places, as well for the conveniency of the multitudes approach, as that their excellent and admirable structure might be the better viewed, and wondred at by all, though scarce understood by any, but such as exceeded in the art of building: All the Statues were made either of white Marble or golden brass, which being intermixt with Cypress Groves or running Fountains, were elevated upon artificial Mounts for their greater splendour, being paved under foot with Mosaick work, giving such a grace and majesty unto the whole City, that the like could not again be parallel'd according to the apprehension of the ravished Prince. It was not long before he had the opportunity to see the Dukes particular riches, when notwithstanding the cunning of the workmen, seemed to have out-done the natural value of the materials, as well in portraicture as carving, although the like Diamonds were not elsewhere to be found through the world, mixed also with some Pearls and Stones of less worth; when he had in a manner surfeited his eyes with all sorts of earthly varieties could be imagined, belonginging unto greatness, and a noble City, where the Duke himself ruled his people by a most absolute Prerogative, howsoever his ordinary State seemed rather retired and private, then common and splendid, as if by his wealth and abundance, he intended to let his neighbouring Princes onely see what he could do, if he pleased; Arethusius thought upon removing farther into Greece , as well to delight his fancy, with the natural solitudes of the Countrey, inhabited by Rural people, as with stately buildings, and curious Artists: In this posture he travelled, sometimes between Trees, even placed in rows, with so just a Geometrical proportion and distance, as if the Countrey had not been created, but made by mans wit, rather then natures power: Nevertheless again in other parts, the barren hills appeared enviously to obscure the green and pregnant vales, that had put on their best apparel to entertain the suns heat, tending towards production of several varieties in Corn, Vines, or Fruits of the most rarest kindes; whilst in the interim on their laps plaid gently for their better refreshment, most sweet and clear Chrystal streams, that neither staid too long, or fled away over fast, from their delight of so beneficial a conversation: From thence Arethusius passed to the Plains of Arcadia , on the Banks of the beautiful River of Ladon ; there he took a singular content, to behold the pleasant and innocent lives of the Countrey Shepherds, whose ambition onely seemed to be in their Pipes musick, with such an art in composing of homely Verses, however in some sort both natural and witty, which made him a little wonder at their faculty and dispositions, that appeared to make that part of the Territory a kinde of a Rural Academy, capable to give content to the most knowingest amongst people: Also he beheld the groves of wood so conveniently placed for delight, and satisfactions of the outward senses, that he admired not now that the Goddess Diana , had formerly taken therein a principal felicity in her ordinary recreations, as well in washing her self in those clear streams, as in chasing the wild beasts through the woods. Longer he would have staid with those inhabitants, but the thoughts of his returning to his sick Joyela , caused him something to bridle his own passions in that particular, insomuch as within two or three dayes space, leaving those parts intirely, at last he arrived at the more ancient then magnificent Town of Argos , unto which the sea notwithstanding seemed to contribute a willing commodity of transportation, although at no very near distance, since Rivers and cut passages were to help what nature had denied to that purpose. No sooner was the Prince entred the City, but as if a day of Jubile had been proclaimed through the streets (though for what cause he knew not) every place seemed to have put on its best ornaments, many Trumpets loudly sounding at at every corner, with divers Altars seated at the Temple Gates, before which the Priests appeared to offer Incense in such a profuse mannner, as if all the Gods had been there assembled presently to be adored: But that which more encreased his wonder, was after he had taken up his Inn near the chief Market- place, (the night now appearing with her sable livery) he beheld in every window of the Town a light burning, besides divers others fires of joy kindled in the streets; these extraordinary appearances in some sort set the youthful desires of Arethusius on a flame, to be satisfied of the prodigy; so that getting some intimate acquaintance of the Master of the house, being as it should seem both courteous and able in his conversation, he was at last won to make this ample relation by degrees, for his further satisfaction, having to that purpose retired themselves into a low Parlour from the rest of the company. Sir, said he, perceiving as well by your countenance, as your words, that you desire some particular accompt of our present actions, with the seeming Triumphs in the City, since it is my place to give content to all persons whatsoever, but more especially to those of your Robe, though as I suppose a stranger of some other parts of Greece , I shall endeavour therein your convenient satisfaction, however I must require your pardon, if my story prove of a longer extent then may be expected, lest the chief lustre thereof might be spoiled, by reason of deficiency in the relation, the rather for that it concerns the religious magnanimity of a Lady, not again as I believe to be parallel'd by any example; so that no circumstance necessary to her honour, ought to be omitted by any tongue or language: To this purpose you must know briefly, that the name of her that is to be the subject of my discourse, as well as already the admiration of the world, is no other but Philogenia , though not onely Daughter, but sole Heir to Thyargos great King of Scythia now deceased, who in his time made all the mighty Territory of Armenia tremble by his conquering arms, accompanied by the force of his dexterity and courage: 'Tis true, I cannot say the Titles to his own Crowns were of the best making, according to the opinion of most of our learned Priests; but I shall meddle alone with his gallantry, no way disputing his possessions, in that he was natural father of the young Lady, at present entertained within the Walls of this ancient City, not onely by the directions of all the chiefest Princes of Peloponenses , but also by the special command of the great Arch-Flamin of Delphos. Arethusius hearing the Lady Philogenia named by the Master of the house, whom he had formerly known, yet no otherwise then by the meer relations of his dear sister the Princess Cloria , he began a little to startle at the intelligence, as if his concernment (though not his nature) might have some more then ordinary interest in her proceedings; so that he appeared more then usual, to give a willinger ear to the ensuing story. But the director of the Inn, being suddenly called away upon some necessary employment belonging to his place, for the entertainment of other strangers, they were forced for the present to break off their further discourse: Nevertheless the next morning the Prince finding a conveniency, when the same party was by chance walking in his Garden, he again put him in minde of the past nights interruption, until they both seated themselves near a running fountain, which gave occasion for the renewing of his former intended discourse, after this manner. As I told you the last night, said he, that I would not meddle with the disputable Titles of that brave and victorious Prince Thyargus , so shall I onely let you know, he being suddenly deprived of his life after all his conquests, however he had before settled the inheritance of his Crowns upon his fair (though Infant) Daughter Philogenia , yet notwithstanding those Commanders that had accompanied him in the Wars of Armenia , lest the glory of their great Master should die for want of their surviving industry, not onely presently swore obedience and fidelity to his hopefull (though young) Daughter, but resolved without any relaxation in courage, to prosecute still their fortunes against the King of Armenia , determining to stay in that Countrey, where they had got so many advantages; insomuch as not long after, the great Monarch himself in the end of the contention was forced in a manner, even to beg a certain peace at his enemies hands, as not being able without such a friendly agreement, to expulse the Scyhians out of his Countrey and Territories: Philogenia by this means having settled to her right, as well the Conquests of her Father, as her own Crowns and Inheritances, and being at last come in processe of time, to a certain maturity of age fit for rule, having in her minority been educated in Learning and all the liberal Sciences, her Subjects whether put on by their own care and affection towards their Countreys good, or were induced thereunto by the procurements of one Dogalphus , a Prince of the blood and of the same extraction, began daily to make Petitions unto her Majesty to marry, whereby as they said, not onely to settle a posterity according to their hopes, for a future succession of her vaste Kingdoms, but also in the interim to be a companion to her self and Government, whereby her youth might be delighted as her State better secured: The rather did they seem to make these motions unto her, for that her Father in his prescriptions had limited her, to a choice onely in her own Kingdom of Scythia: The young Queen, whose wit and spirit do seem at the least to parallel both her youth and beauty, which made her more in love with generous huntings, accompanied by the sound of warlike Instruments, then with soft and amorous complements, according to the custom of other Ladies of her years, was rather content for the present, to let the propositions of her people sleep in some quiet obscurity, then either to trouble her self with a reply, or give any seeming distaste to her Subjects in that particular; especially when she considered, not onely as she thought, that many of the Commanders of the Army were of that party, but also how peremptory were the directions of her dead Father to that purpose. In prosecution of this resolution (since as it should seem, she had either no inclination to marry at all, or at the most not to be contented with the Spousals of her own Subject) she retired into the Countrey, where for the most part she spent her time in study, unless it were when she used the sport of several sorts of huntings, for her better delight and more recreation, however at other seasons she would behold armed Troops to exercise their vocation; in all which employments there appeared in her thoughts and nature such a masculine spirit, as not onely shewed from what stock she was descended, but even did presage she was not born in the world, but for some magnanimous designs, either towards the Gods worship, or mens perswasion, for that her employments were alwayes directed to noble and extraordinary ends. Again when she found her self any thing weary of these retirements, she would make progresses through her whole Countrey, sometimes viewing the places from whence were digged Gold and other Mettals, belonging to the Revenues of her Crown. Other whiles receiving as she went Petitions from those distressed subjects, that needed more particularly her goodness and justice, in their several causes and injuries: Neither did she ever fail in her journeys to visit Temples with other remarkable Academies of Learning and Piety, whereas she used to dispute in person with the greatest Philosophers she could meet withall; sometimes contending with her own Priests, as concerning the truth and reality of their Doctrine, since as she said, they had left the ancient Worship of the Gods, according to the manner and customs of Delphos . But whilst the young Princess Philogenia , spent her time in the Countrey in this manner, however looking afar off also at her affairs in her Court, and great City of the Kingdom, where those Councellors and Ministers of State she had appointed alwayes remained, both to receive her commands and directions, of a sudden came to Court the young Lord Dogalphus , from the wars and employments of Armenia , where as chief General of the Armies in those parts, he had spent a few years; rather because his place and quality seemed to exact the preferment from the State, then that his experience and dexterity in the Wars, could merit much above any of the ordinary Commanders. No sooner was he arrived in his own Countrey, and the Queen again returned to her Palace in the City, but this young Prince, whether or no put on by his own opinions, or more likely sent for by some of the Nobility to that purpose, for fear lest a stranger might in time come to be their Sovereign, since Philogenia seemed to hold intimate correspondency, with Ambassadours belonging to other Princes, began of a sudden extreamly to court the affections of this young Lady; insomuch as oftentimes she was forced before the face of the multitude, something abruptly to retire from his discourses; in regard as she was unwilling to give him any encouragements, in what she never intended to let him enjoy, so of other side, she resolved not to put any affront publickly upon his person, for that he was so near both to her Father and her self in blood; wherefore hoped rather to weary his expectation insensibly, by not giving countenance and hearing to his expressions, then by a down-right denial, to exasperate his spleen, towards some dangerous factions, to the disturbing of her peaceable Government, and Tranquility of her people; since as she knew he had got some more then ordinary interest amongst the Souldiers, so did she probably believe, he wanted not many friends in her own Court of the same stamp, that might easie enough prejudice her affairs: Besides she considered, that her Father designing her a Husband onely out of her own Countrey of Scythia , could possibly mean no other to meet with her years and quality, then Prince Dogalphus: As these thoughts and considerations, extreamly troubled the minde of Philogenia , who either had other designs in her love, or else meant not to love at all; wherefore one day sending for the Syrian Ambassadour, (a person whose abilities not onely renderd him deservedly worthy of his employment, in regard of his excellent skill in State Affairs, but one also whom she was accustomed to make of her counsel, in very many things belonging to her present Government) and made this Speech unto him. My Lord said, said she, as it is well known my noble and most dear Father, undertook the conquest of the vaste Territory of Armenia , principally by the instigation and procurement of your great and wise Favourite Philostros, with the authority of Orsames , though both buried now to the worlds eye, however their actions still appear in a full prospect to be admired, by all people of the surviving age, so hath my self ever since endeavoured, to keep on foot the same interest and correspondency; notwithstanding I have been earnestly solicited to the contrary, by all the wayes that ever faction or spite could invent, whereby to dissolve that honourable tye, which was first contracted by those two invincible and heroical spirits and Monarchs: To this purpose I shall not need much to dilate upon that limitation, which it pleased my dead Father to put upon my condition, in the choice of my future Husband, being as it is said onely within the Confines of my own Kingdom, since nature cannot possibly admit of any such obligation, when the least quality amongst the poorest and basest of my Subjects, will no doubt pretend to a greater freedom, grounded upon so sacred and binding an election, accompanied by all the reasons that either Gods or men have used in the prescription of their Laws, given here upon earth for mortality to observe: Nevertheless so it is, that whether by the crafty practices of some of the Nobility, who either are not satisfied with my Jurisdiction, or are willing to see the Syrian Power so much flourish within the compass of my Court, have of late put on the inconsiderate multitude, not onely to desire me with some exclamations speedily to marry, whereby as they feign to secure the Kingdom from all treachery, but also to chuse one of my own Subjects, for a companion in my conversation and government: As I shall not be obliged at the present, to dispute any way the worth of his person, since if I marry at all I am resolved, not to be circumscribed but by the Suns circumference, which probably can bring heat and honour to these Northern Climates, so must I desire you, to impart unto me your faithful advice in this particular, not only for the better quieting of my peoples affections but for the greater dignity of that fortunate State which you now serve, in whose power and magnificence, I put my chief trust and confidence; notwithstanding those prescriptions enjoyned me, by these unreasonable Laws of this Nation: For howsoever it may be said, that my father imposed this injunction from my female condition, in regard of the surer establishment of his new conquered Dominions, as perhaps fearing too much the weakness of my sex, to bear the weight of such a heavy burthen, without some more probable and active assistance, yet I suppose, he did not intend his decrees unalterable, when other considerations of more consequence might govern my affections, to a more noble and proper choice, belonging to mine own honour, if not his Empires good and establishment. Crowns are not worth I say enjoying, when to be worn with such base limitation; so that the world must be the Stage, whereon I am resolved to play my part, where greatest Kings may be the onely judges of my actions: With these words she gently wept, yet with such a graceful Majesty did the tears trickle down her fair cheeks, as if she had something more in her heart, that as yet she had not exprest by her discourse, which gave the Ambassadour as much cause of wonder as pitty: nevertheless finding by her silent though stedfast looks, that she expected some reply; after a short space of consideration, he made her this answer. Most great and vertuous Queen said he, as mighty Orontes the Son of that victorious Prince you named Orsames , who gave the first original to your Fathers conquest in Armenia , must needs acknowledge the obligations of your favours, in preferring his friendship before other Kings, so will he never fail to give that assistance to your commands, as Asia shall rather tremble at your prosperity, then any power compel you to what choice soever, without your own liking and election: Yet that I may not proceed lacking an honourable command, or you want those circumstances belonging to your dignity, since a Syrian Husband can onely match you both in dignity and profit, I shall suspend my counsel, as you may your resolution, until my return from Damascus , whither you know I am now going for your service; as well as upon my Masters business: In the interim you cannot miss of excuses, as well to satisfie the greedy multitudes expectation, concerning your future marriage, as the preventing of the Noblemens designs to that purpose, for that the day of your solemn Coronation is near at hand, to which triumphs your people, are rather to be obedient and attentive, then any way before that time to expect determinations, when you are yet scarce arrived to a competency of years, belonging to the Government of your Kingdom; and therefore not fit before a better experience to think of a tye, which never again can be unloosed, but with the dissolution of your self or Husband; which otherwise might turn to the endangering of your peoples liberties, by the general combination of other Princes against your inconsiderate choice, wherein the great Monarch of Syria ought to have the first place for advice. When the Ambassadour had delivered thus much in her hearing, she told him, that as she liked very well his counsel, since forreign States were to participate, not onely in the election of her Husband, but also in those circumstances and decorums appertaining to her speedy inauguration, which ought to be performed, with all ceremonies possibly belonging to the dignity of her royalty; so on the other side was she determined, inviolably to conserve the ancient friendship contracted between the two Crowns: however for her affections, she resolved to dispose of them as she pleased, notwithstanding her Fathers direction seemed as yet, to hold some prerogative over the whole Kingdom of Scythia ; for however as she said, she received from him her Government, by a lawful descent in nature, nevertheless she conceived the right of fancy and liking concerning her marriage, onely-belonged to her self in particular, by a more transcendent obligation: Wherefore as she would have all Kings to judge charitably of her thoughts, yet could she not promise, but that her actions might sometimes be misconstrued, if not wondered at by many, for that she had in her opinion a difficult part to play, between her duty and her honour, however she would to the best of her power endeavour to preserve both. After the Ambassadour was parted from her with this resolution, to take his journey suddenly for the great City of Damascus , whither he intended to carry the news of her stately designed Coronation, Philogenia began a little to ponder upon what he had said unto her, apprehending the Kingdom of Syria , expected some more then ordinary power over both her actions and Government, and more especially in appointing her a Husband of the Syrian interest, though not of the same blood, in which particular her spirits, as well as her fancy, had no minde to be limited, in regards as her nature coveted a freedom in all her actions, so more directly in this high election, where she was not onely by all the rules of reason and justice to please (in an ample manner) her own affections, but also in some measure to give satisfaction to other Princes, who would as she thought either honour or despise her actions, according to the weakness or fortitude she should shew, deeming her thereby either worthy of Government or not; since putting her self unwisely under another jurisdiction, in the infancy of her Reign, would make the world believe, her capacity knew not how to command, though blinde fortune had cast the lot undeservedly upon her condition: What other things might be in her apprehensions I will not say, since as for certain in her childehood, she had the tender of many a young and gallant Prince of several Nations for a Husband; so was her minde alwayes addicted to view the world, with the rarities of other Countreyes besides her own; as it might be thought, being not well satisfied either with that cold climate where she remained, or was able to procure from her Priests a convincing answer to those points, concerning the Worship of the Gods, practised in Scythia , contrary to the customs used in the Temple of Delphos ; but be it what it will, the time drawing on for the ceremonies of her perfect installment in her dignity, put off for the present, her further consideration in these particulars, onely it was observed that after the departure of the Syrian Ambassadour, she began to entertain a more nearer intimacy with an officer of State, that the Egyptian King had also sent to reside in her Court; which in time so augmented in outward shew, that as her opinions seemed to decrease from her wonted confidence of Orontes power, so did she bestow her frequentest conversation, in the company of this new favourite, whom as it was thought not onely advanced his Masters esteem with the young Queen, but fortified her doubts concerning her Countries Religion: In the interim, whilst divers sorts of Triumphs were preparing for the magnificent solemnity of Philogenia's Coronation, there arrived many Ambassadours from several Princes, some to honour the feast with their presence, as others to confirm leagues from her Dominions; and all to congratulate her happiness, as well in the intire obedience of her own Subjects, as in the powerfulness of her interest in Forreign States: To every one of whom, she returned alwayes most becoming and exquisite complements, not alone in her own language, but in those tongues which best suited with their practices, insomuch as within a short time she became the wonder of those that were present, and the talk of such as were absent, when as her discourses and entertainments were not according to the customs of other Ladies of her years and beauty, but for the most part imployed in viewing and correcting the exercises of her armed Souldiers, drawn out often in the Field to give her content and satisfaction: Other whiles again, she spent her time by Councels, in making Leagues and Contracts with all sorts of Nations, that desired either her friendship or assistance; wherein she alwayes strived to procure the best advantage for her own people, however she never broke her word or promise with any Prince, after the agreement was once sealed between them: Notwithstanding that Philogenia in this manner, seemed to grasp in her possession all the felicities of the earth, yet in her countenance there was still observed, a kinde of a sad reservedness, not differing much from melancholly or discontent; shewing that inwardly, either she was not very well pleased with something, or that her minde agitated designs of extraordinary great consequence, her thoughts being in a manner alwayes taken up, and imployed with pensiveness. In the interim, that the Temples were preparing to offer the most magnificent sacrifices could be devised, for the Queens future prosperity, and most of the Merchants building sundry Triumphant Arches, for the passage of those goodly Troops that should accompany her in the stately procession, was to be beheld upon the more solemn day of her Coronation, some dayes before Prince Dogalphus thought it an obligation in a sort belonging to his honour, as well as his profession, to dedicate in his own person a Turnament to the fair Philogenia , whom his inward fancy esteemed not much less then his espoused Wife, for that he found as he thought, her carriage now to be altered towards his particular, though alwayes discreet in the face of the multitude, since she never seemed to decline from that Majesty, that appertained to her dignity and calling; which opinion of his became extreamly fortified, by the general applause of the whole Kingdom, joyned with the direction her Father had left to some of his ancient councellours, to see his Daughter married according to those prescribed rules of Government, belonging to the Scythian Nation; they being no way backward to represent unto her consideration, those memories upon all fitting occasions, as well to keep her from entertaining too near a correspondency with strange Princes, as the better to assure the State, to be ordered by the same Laws and Customs, wherein themselves as they knew would still be kept in authority; especially when as both the King and the Queen were young, and not probably to be diverted from lending a willing ear alwayes to their counsels and directions: When the time of tilting came, unto which meeting, many Princes of forreign parts had been invited; some to be spectators of that gallant exercise, and others if they pleased, to try the force of their lance against the youthful and courageous challenger; Dogalphus himself appeared in the Field most richly apparelled: His Armour was painted over with the resemblances of Snow; whereas his Bases figured the likeness of Icy Rocks of unequal height, whilst his Caparison made a kinde of an artificial Sea, being so neatly contrived in the work, that each seemed to be an ornament to the other, for the better representation of a Countrey, belonging wholly to the Northern Region, where his Lady and Mistress the great Queen of Scythia reigned: In his Shield was painted a young Courtier like himself, all armed but the head, whose intention was exprest by this Motto: No Climate can freeze the effects of violent love: His horse was likewise milk white, whom he mannaged with so good a grace before the Throne of the beautiful Queen, that the people with a loud acclamation of joy, seemed in a kinde to congratulate their future Nuptials, although in the interim Philogenia was noted, onely to cast down her countenance upon the ground, with nothing but a melancholly look, instead of other expressions: Here Clitaphon , for so was the Hoast called, made some apology for the tediousness of his discourse, in relating so many circumstances: He told Arethusius withal, that as he hoped he would excuse him for some impertinences, belonging to a great Ladies adventures, so did he not intend to trouble his ears any more; but as near as he could with the very things, that an Egyptian Priest now in the Town, appertaining to the Queens train, had particularly informed him of: The disguised Prince was so far from being any way wearied with the length of his relation, that as he thanked him for the pains he had taken already in his satisfaction, so could he wish, as he said, the story might never have any end, since both the teller and the tale proved so beyond measure delightful to his apprehension, which again put Clitaphon to the continuation of his History. As soon as Dogalphus , as I said had thus performed his first reverences, before the stately Tribunal of the Queen Philogenia , however with what thoughts it was not well known, he went presently and reposed himself in a most rich Pavilion of yellow Damask, set up at one end of the list, there to attend the approach of any Knight or Champion, who intended to encounter his resolution, or defend his own honour. 'Tis true, the young Prince carried himself with so much bravery and courage all the day, that notwithstanding many opposed him and his company, yet he bore away the chief prize of the Field from the rest, till the dark night (the peremptory decider of such differences) made them retreat again into the Town, to seek more milde conversation amongst the Ladies of the Court, intending next morning to begin a new exercise of honour, towards a farther trial of their vertues; Ph aebus had scarce given a glorious light to the day, but Dogalphus either heated by his love, or warmed in his ambition, issued out into the Lists, shining with Arms and armed in confidence, where no sooner was he arrived, but he was encountered (accompanied by his Troop) with divers persons of several fortunes, some leaving themselves, and others their horses in testimony they were all overcome, either by his prosperity, or the Lances of his followers; insomuch as at last none appeared for a long space, that intended to contend, much less to overcome; which caused the multitude with many exclamations of joy to celebrate his praises, as if the whole tilting had been already finished whilst in the interm Dogalphus himself for his better repose, retired again into his gallant Pavilion; for however none came to encounter this seeming victorious Champion, yet by the Laws of the Turnament, another day was designed to try, or expect the final issue of the sport: So that again Dogalphus appearing in the Field, Philogenia contrary to her former resolutions, sent word to the Judges, that she could not be at conclusion of those Triumphs, wherefore gave them commission, to begin when they pleased in her absence. This message, or rather the alteration of the Queens former determination, made many variable interpretations among the common people: Some thought an indisposition onely of health had caused her to forbear her presence in that general assembly, since she seemed for the two first dayes, to be a most earnest spectator of all the brave actions, that had been there performed, to the honour of her Kingdom of Scythia: Others again imagined, that rather some weighty affairs belonging to her Government, which held her from the present assembly, whereby to give her attendance upon the finishing of those noble exercises, which they knew in the general most delighted her nature; especially it being now near the time of her own Coronation: Neither was there wanting a third sort of conjecturing spirits, who supposed, however Philogenia appeared in outward shew to congratulate the Princes victories, yet in her heart she neither affected his person, or was willing overmuch to advance his esteem in publick, wherefore abstained from coming to the lifts, left she might be obliged with her own hands, to bestow the Crown of Honour appointed for the Conquerour; in regard of which, the peoples affection might come to be more increased towards his particular: But those notwithstanding, that were better acquainted with her vertuous thoughts and heroical determinations, knew that no motions of base envy, could possibly enter into her breast and considerations, and therefore attributed her absence meerly to accident, or necessary imployments: However, much of the Triumphs seemed in this manner to be darkned, by wanting their chief lustre, the Queens presence; yet the Prince continued in his own person, those gallantries before the face of the multitude, as not onely won their commendation in a most violent expression (who for the most part are guided with excess of passions) but also merited much commendation in the very thoughts and opinions of those, that in their judgements could best distinguish without partiality, until about noon (being again reposed in his Tent) he was suddenly saluted by a young Page of extraordinary beauty, who kneeled without many circumstances, and used this language unto him. Sir, said he, my Lord and Master understanding of these generous sports, by a general summons, wherein no stranger of quality (as he hath been informed) shall be excluded from trying the force of his Lance against the fortunes of the Challenger (which in effect renders the design more noble) hath upon that score of confidence, taken a journey out of his own Countrey into this great Kingdom of Scythia , whereby in a youthful way (without any malice) to venter a fall with the glorious Prince Dogalphus in a single encounter, who as he understands hath purchased an immortal fame by his brave and gallant atchievements, in this noble exercise of honour and valour, being assured, as he can lose nothing by any disaster can befal him in such a Combat, so shall he get an incomparable reputation by carrying of himself in any manner equal, to so deserving a courage and dexterity. Dogalphus , however he appeared something confounded at this sudden and unexpected salutation, yet considering the nature of the tilting, and the bravery of the offer, without examining further the dignity of the person (since worth consisted more in action then in Herauldry) not onely freely accepted of the challenge, but caused the Page with an extraordinary respect, to be ushered out of his Pavilion: Although the Prince prepared his thoughts with courage and assurance, to entertain this new and bold stranger with the point of his Lance, yet considering all particulars, he could not in his minde, but much wonder who the party should be, that in the very purclose of his victories, would needs attempt new adventures, either to the hazzarding of his own disgrace, or the obstructing of his prosperity; but the warning did not give him any great space for consideration, in regard within half an hours time at the most, the Champion himself appeared in person at the other end of the lifts, ready armed to make good the entertained quarrel, which seemed notwithstanding to consist more in the vertue of their Lances, then in the malice of their hearts, however it might be supposed, that emulation not to be termed envy, had something enflamed their spleens one against the other, since as they both aimed at victory, so was it likely their pretensions were a little different in nature; the stranger desiring to get what the other had already in possession, as Dogalghus unwilling that any should be so injurious, as to go about to deprive him of what he had most justly merited, by the common opinion of all the spectators. I must a little (said Clytaphon ) dwell upon the description of the accommodation of the new Champion, before I come to the encounter it self, since to the view of the present assembly, his accoutrement seemed almost as strange to their fancies, as the quality and condition of the party did to their knowledges; for he was mounted upon a coal black horse, that pretended in appearance to a settled strength, more governed by age or use, then inclinable to any hot fireriness in shew, as if the destinies had intended a kinde of a fatal difference in the Champions designs, seeing they had made an opposition, both in the colours and deportments of their horses; his Arms notwithstanding the perfect groundwork was perfect steel, of a rusty hue, yet was it all over imbellished with the resemblances of womens hair, when best curled for advantage or ornament of the fairest complexion: His Bases represented female garments, such as the warlike Amazons are described to wear in hunting, whilst the Caparison was onely made into the similitude of a Couch of Crimson Velvet: In his Shield was pictured a Pentheselea with this Motto: As education hath changed my nature, so may vertue again alter my being to a better form: Half a dozen of small Pages carried six staves, which belike he intended to imploy in the encounter. In fine, not to render my story over long, since already I fear me I have too much injured your patience, after that all fitting circumstances were performed according to the prescribed Laws of the Turnament, the Champions being placed at a convenient distance one from another, at last met with so graceful and even an encounter, that scarce could the Judges themselves determine by their opinions, who had the better of the just. In this equality of tilting they continued for four courses, the people all the while wondering who the stranger should be, that in so equal a measure, had been able to match their Prince, whom they esteemed in a manner invincible, in regard of his former dayes fortunes and performances: But however the variable multitude were carried away with several imaginations, wishing alwayes the final victory to Dogalphus ; yet the fifth course plainly decided the controversies, for the stranger Knight, whether by his own skill and dexterity in that kinde of exercise, or being rather at the present (as 'twas thought) favoured by his extreamly complying fates, bore down the horse of Dogalphus to the earth, with some more then ordinary violence, insomuch as he had something to do again for a long space, to recover his footing before the eyes of the people, by which means the Prince himself was put into no small disorder, visible to the apparent discontent of the whole multitude, that doubted not in his person, but the Countrey of Scythia , would have carried away the chief prize of honour, from all the rest of the world besides: Fain would Dogalphus have revenged his honour, by the power of his naked Sword in a single duel, since the youthful deficiency of his horse, as he pretended, had onely given him accidentally the foil: But the laws of the Turnament would in no kinde admit of the trial; wherefore it was ordered by the Judges (who notwithstanding were willing enough to become something partial in the Princes behalf) that the stranger should now discover both his person and quality, since his glory could not be diminished, but rather augmented thereby: which not long after procured another wonder; for however the party a great while disputed strongly against the resolution, yet at last being wholly overcome, as well by the cryes of the people, as the obligations of the tilting, the Knights Helmet being plucked off, there appeared to the view of all the spectators, the lovely countenance of the fair Philogenia , the admirable Queen of the Scythian Nation, her golden hair in a most plentiful and becoming manner, flowing abundantly about her armed shoulders: What amazement, love, and reverend apprehensions, this sight brought to the whole assembly, may rather be imagined then expressed: In the interim nothing but acclamations of joy, were heard through the whole Field, being also suddenly seconded with the sound of Trumpets, and other noises of warlike instruments, tending to the immortal praises of the youthful and gallant Queen. As Philogenia quickly in a short oration gave the multitude a particular account, as well of the action, as of her intentions, with many other circumstances in defence and excuse of her Cousins fortunes, wherein modestly she waved her own glory, though she confest her natural inclinations, to be more given to martial exercises, then to court delights, contrary to her sex and calling: So the company again of the other side, thought the accident pretended to a most lucky Omen, as well concerning their future marriage, as in her gallant government, presaging her disposition, to be like her brave Fathers, who from his conquest had bequeathed so many Crowns to her dispose: Wherefore after all these congratulations, turning her self to the Prince with a smile, that rather expressed love then demanded honour, she let him know, that however fortune had given her something the better of the day, or rather the partiality of the people, to shew that Ladies were to be victorious over men by a kinde of a secret determination of the Fates, yet to demonstrate that it proceeded from a blinde instinct onely, she was more beholding to his horse for it (being altogether an unreasonable creature) then to her own worth or discretion, that might very well have lost her to disgrace and confusion in the enterprize, instead of giving any satisfaction to her own ambition. Although the Queens bravery, and affable disposition, sufficiently delighted the whole company, yet there might be perceived in Dogalphus countenance, a certain shame mixed with anger, however his smiles and respectful language, desired to shew the contrary to the multitude, insomuch as his discretion quickly tempered all his passions: Wherefore telling Philogenia , that as her excellent vertues had but publickly before the face of the people, purchased more visibly that due, which privately in her own Court she had alwayes merited, so might she be assured, that a principal obligation belonged to all her actions, over his thoughts and affections, whether openly performed or in secret intended; onely he desired, if she pleased at any time to seek adventures in forreign parts, that he at least wise might have the honour to carry her Shield after her, as her most humble Esquire and Servant during life: With these words the Queen again smiled, being presently conducted to her Castle, with all the ceremonious triumph could possibly be imagined, belonging to such an exploit: But notwithstanding this brave act of chivalry in the young Queen, might have raised her thoughts to vain glorious comportment, amongst all sorts of people, both without and within her spacious and large Dominions, yet on the contrary was she observed, to be much more retired then before, scarce ever appearing in publick, but upon extraordinary occasions, or when necessary audience was required by Ambassadours from other Princes, or her Subjects of the most eminent quality; when also she put on in her countenance and apparel, a kinde of a sad, though not a discontented gravity: Whether or no this was done as many supposed, to avoid all manner of familiarity with Dogalphus courtships, or out of a desire to be more private in her studies without any interruption, could not be well understood by the common sort of people, saving in her discourses she would very often mention, not onely the fashions and behaviours of other Courts and Countries, but also dispute and question those about her person, by what Titles her Father held as well his proper Territories of the Kingdom of Scythia , as those others which he had so newly conquered before his death; since as she said, it was apparent, that the lawful Heir, had been outed and disinherited by the violence of the people for no other cause, but in regard he would not change the Worship of the Gods from the Delphine Rites. Besides she would divers times aver, that Kings and Princes lost much of their knowledge and lustre, by not conversing indifferently amongst strange Nations, since books and reading did in the general but relate, what a worthy and brave courage should personally put in practice, for the best advantage both of himself and others. In these kindes of entertainments the time was passed away, until the more necessary solemnity of Philogenia's Coronation; called in a manner every expectation, to a most diligent and strict attendance; which was to be performed for the greater state, in the chief City of the Kingdom, where no condition of any sort failed to be missing. The day before the Triumph, all the streets were adorned according to the capacity of each housholder in particular, with their most exactest furniture and best industry. The morning gave the Trumpets of the Court an early warning, to be ready in their new Liveries, for the summoning of all those that were to be actors in the shew, whereby to conduct their young Queen joyfully to take possession of her Throne, with what Majesty was convenient for her Dignity. In this posture they arrived at the Palace Gates, where many guards of Souldiers stood to keep the heady and rude multitude, either from disorders, or approaching with too much insolency her Sacred Royal Presence: At last Philogenia her self issued forth, clad all in white, onely wearing upon her head a Coronet of Gold beset with Pearl, whilst in the interim her fair hair in negligent curles, seemed in a decent manner to cover her shoulders, which were clothed with a watchet Mantle reaching to the ground, clean through lined by the purest Ermine, though powdered here and there with black: She was presently placed in an Ivory Chariot drawn with six horses of the Arabian breed: Before her stood a Christal Table studded all over in every joynt, with most rare and curious workmanship, whereon lay her Regal Crown and Scepter, enriched with Diamonds of inestimable values: Of either side of her moving Throne, went four and twenty Pages habited after the Persian manner, bearing guilded Darts or Poleaxes in their hands: Prince Dogalphus assisted by all the prime Nobility of the Nation, carried the Sword of Honour before the Queen, whilst her Train behinde was born up by many choice Virgins of the City; which company also was followed by the great Ladies on horseback, guarded with divers Troops of the Court Souldiers. To conclude, after that Philogenia with all this gallant Train had been at the Temple, according to the custome, paying her Devotions to the Gods of her Countrey, she received her Crown with Ceremony by the hands of the high Flamin of Scythia , from whence being presently attended to the common Hall of the same Town, in the same manner and order, she left her Palace, wearing the other Diadem upon her head, where having seated her self upon a transparent Throne, newly prepared in the place for that purpose, after the Nobility and Magistrates had performed their due reverence, acknowledging her by oath to their onely lawful Queen and Sovereign; when Dogalphus came also in like manner to perform the last Ceremony belonging to the solemnity, she bid him rise from the ground, until she had by a few words (as she said) delivered her minde to the people: So that pausing for half a quarter of an hours space, sometimes looking stedfastly upon the earth, and then again casting her eyes up towards the Heavens, she at last uttered this language. If Princes be Gods, said she, as you would have them to be in your common flatteries, why are you unwilling to allow them those priviledges that belong to ordinary persons? If they be limited in their power by Kingdoms prescriptions, how is it, that some ascribe Divinity to their calling? Either make them less I say, in your words, or to all opinions, which perhaps may bring the dignity to an even proportion, whereby to Reign by a just and known Right, or be conducted in all their actions, onely to please popular fancy; in which condition I say, it is better to be a Subject then a King, since the one without care possesses what he hath, whereas the other appears no better then a slave Crowned for every ones profit but his own: 'Tis true this day with much Triumph and more Ceremonies you have with one voice proclaimed me to be your Queen, yet lacking the nature of jurisdiction, how can I govern as I ought, since contradictions in command, and distractions in execution, will necessarily hinder the effects, let my endeavours be what they will to that purpose? besides the falsifying of your own oaths newly taken, when as the Scythian Nation challengeth as great a prerogative to their Princes, as any other Countrey in the world, and why I should be less in esteem then my Predecessours, I know not, seeing I finde my heart as big with noble thoughts, as any of my Ancestors, though adorned in their times with never so many gallant victories? If you have held me at the first worthy to be your Ruler, no reason I should be denied now, that which pleaseth my self for your good; but if you intended not me the command, when you solemnly profest it before the face of Heaven; you have dissembled both with the Gods and your Prince, wherefore you deserve not the faith of any other Nation: If this be the condition of my hereditary titles, let it not be thought those surmised laws can circumscribe me either in my glory or greatness: insomuch as say not, that Philogenia was appointed onely to marry in the Countrey of Scythia , when that confinement would take from her what perhaps she most desires, and in the opinion of other States all Regalities, since so she wears not her Crowns by right, but by benevolence, wherefore again may be no Queen, when her Subjects please to dislike her actions: By any of these conditions, as I am determined not to hold a Scepter in mine hand, so would I not have you for your own honours, pretend to such base and unworthy customs, seeing other Kings would be scandalized at the offer: Although it may be said, that my Father imposed the injunction upon the Nation, yet it will be no plea for your fidelities, since however he gave me life to enjoy that dignity wherein I am placed, yet had he no power to alter the foundation of the Government, which the fates have now cast upon me, without any unreasonable limitations, that neither correspond with Nature or Divinity, seeing meanest people of the earth will not be thus confined. I am so far from saying thus much to lessen the opinion of my own Countrey, when as I rather urge it to animate your souls, whereby not to keep your fame bounded, onely by the Scythian Regions, for that heretofore even women have appeared miracles in other parts, as well for valour as fortune; and why onely should Philogenia be hindred, from shewing like spirit in other places beyond her own Dominions, as it were waving that honour to her self both at home and abroad, seeing so many Queens of the Nation have enjoyed the liberty? Let it suffice, free I am, and unbound I intend to remain; yet because my dear and ever glorious Father, as it is thought, hath desired, though not commanded this observation, whose appetites as well as acts, I would have alwayes sacred; I do here in this general assembly, make and constitute my Cousin, Prince Dogalphus , present King of Scythia , expecting he should either govern well or conquer bravely, according to the example of our gallant Ancestors, from whence both he and I had our first original; whilst my ambition shall be content onely, with those Territories purchased with the life and courage of your late King, until my future endeavours shall compass larger Dominions, or dispose of my person to other services, more glorious and worthy, which yet remains undetermined privately in my own breast. With these words, she rose suddenly from her Throne, accompanied by such a frown, as shewed, however duty had caused her to make this election, yet she was not well pleased with her Subjects presumption, that had put her thoughts to such a determination, before her own voluntary pleasure had been attended to the issue. Here again Clitaphon was called away by reason of some necessary business belonging to the house, but promised in the afternoon, both to continue and make an end of his relation, whilst in the interim, disguised Arethusius had leasure enough, as well to contemplate the story, as more particularly to reflect upon what his Sister had told him, belonging to his own person; however his hopes, at leastwise his intentions, became altogether frustrated to that effect, since his own fortunes needed now, rather Kingdoms to assist him, then Crowns to be despised, and cast away out of any gallantry whatsoever: When they had dined amongst other company, Clitaphon to make good his promised relation, finding his young guest with his eyes began to exact the obligation, led him into another convenient place, both of repose, and free from interruption, where beginning where he had ended in the morning, he thus proceeded. Gentle Sir, said he, as the passages I have already related, concerning the actions of this great Lady, merit I must confess, as much wonder as belief, so are you further to know by my discourses, that after Philogenia had quitted the Government of her Kingdoms, in this manner to her Couzen Prince Dogalphus , she thought upon her own speedy retirement into other parts, not being willing as it should seem to remain a Subject where she had been a Queen, it being incompatible with Heroical natures, to be under that Dominion they once commanded, insomuch as within a short time (all things being prepared to the purpose) by a gallant Fleet she was conveyed over the Sea from Scythia , into the further Territories of Armenia , where those Jurisdictions lay, which her Father had conquered from Artaxes: Besides, there was also sent with her an Army of Land Souldiers, in regard that some Towns stood out in Rebellion against the Scythian Crown, which notwithstanding belonged to that agreement, she had made with her Couzen Dogalphus , to be continued still as Revenues, appertaining to her support and maintenance: Many other things also had relation to this accord, which for brevity sake, I will for the present omit, since they do not much either augment the truth of the story, or at all decrease the strangeness of these actions and adventures themselves: Nevertheless, Philogenia after her arrival, remained some time in Armenia , as well to visit some kindred and friends she had in those parts, as to see a better settlement of those Countreys and fortunes, between her Cousin and her particular, which continued her according to her former custom chiefly imployed, either in study or hunting, accompanied in the interim for the most part, by the Egyptian Ambassadour, who was noted of all others to have the greatest influence, both over her Councels and Designs; insomuch as being frequently saluted by divers of the Princes of Asia with Ambassadours; alone a messenger from the State and Kingdom of Syria came to expostulate, not onely with her near and intimate correspondency, belonging to the Egyptians , being esteemed mortal enemies to that State; but most peremptorily required to be made acquainted, particularly with her intentions and designs in the future; unto which she made scarce any other reply, then the world should see them very shortly as well as himself. This gave rather cause of displeasure then satisfaction to the Officer; so that from the Countrey of Syria , not long after came many publick aspersions against her person, that as it is thought hindred her intentions from visiting the great City and Court of Damascus ; wherefore of a sudden altering her course contrary to all mens expectation, she descended into the pleasant Valleys of Daphene , where she continued amongst those delightful Groves, upon the Confines of both Countreys, visiting the Temples of Religious People, and entertaining her time with other privacies, until she was invited into the Countrey of Pamphilia , by the King of Egypts special directions; where notwithstanding she arrived not but in a disguise, as well to put off all occasion of State belonging to the Dignity, as to avoid in some sort the necessary expence of her Reception, not onely in regard her own Revenues were not perfectly settled from the Kingdom of Scythia , but also for that the Principality of Pamphilia , being in war with the Syrians , had neither leasure to perform fitting and convenient Ceremonies, or much treasure to spend in superfluities. There I may say she remained for some moneths undiscovered, at leastwise in a posture not desirous to appear what she was, although often seen by the common people, and visited privately by those of the better; insomuch that many suspected not onely her intentions, but questioned her capacities, as well for that she aimed at nothing but a few small impertinencies, seeing she would scarce admit women to her conversation, in any manner to do her publick service; until at last her Revenues comming in some measure from Scythia , she then began to take state upon her person, according to the Dignity of a Queen, wherein she alwayes carried her self beyond admiration, as well for those excellent discourses she held in all ceremonious audiences, as in the several decorums she used to every Prince and person of quality, according to the nature of their degrees and conversation: But above all she was noted to frequent the Temples (although not then of her profest Religion) with no small reverence; sometimes disputing with the Priests concerning their Rites and Customs, and then gently informing them, she was not very far from their opinions, although the rigid Laws of Scythia (as she said) had entirely banished that exercise from the practice of the vulgar. In this manner she continued, shewing her parts and winning affections, intermixed notwithstanding with a certain kinde of Majestick gravity, losing nothing of her State, however in effect she had given it away to her Couzen, until she was advertised that Dogalphus the new King, had newly with a most potent Army, invaded the Territories of Trapasus , whose Prince rather claimed to be King of Scythia , then that his own Dominions should be molested, as he pretended, by a second wrong. I will not here, said Clytaphon , entertain you with the expostulation of Titles, since Princes for the most part now adayes, make their Swords rather dispute their pretensions, then Lawyers plead their causes; onely so it was, that Dogalphus being called in by the many Rebellions and discontents of the Countrey, taking advantage of another powerful neighbour invading also the same, within a very short space over-ran in a manner the whole, without almost any contradiction: But what may be the issue, time will shew, and people must expect, since as it is given out in another part of Scythia , not under Dogalphus Jurisdiction, a Prince threatens to make a speedy resistance, against all his conquering though injurious victories, purchased as they say, by reason of the infidelity of the Subjects of Trapasus , towards their own lawfull King: Whatsoever may be the pretensions, or the success of Dogalphus in this expedition, Queen Philogenia intending notwithstanding to satisfie her own youthful curiolities, or being put on by some other determinations, onely known then as it was thought to her own private fancies, though now more fully discovered to the world, resolved to make a speedy journey to the Temple of Delphos , in Achaia , either to consult that Oracle, or salute the great Flamin: But in this interim the old Priest dying, her voyage intended became protracted for a time, until there should be a new Governour elected in his place; for that there wanted a conveniency for her purposes, all the Temples and Rarities of the City, being not to be seen or visited by any person of what quality soever: Wherefore by reason of this accident, she was constrained to spend some time longer in the lower parts of Armenia , since the Countrey of Pamphilia , happening to be furiously assaulted by the Syrian Forces, she thought it fit to remove her station under the Egyptian Jurisdiction: In short, Sir, not to trouble you longer with too many superfluities, more then needs for your necessary information, this great and excellent Lady is now come to Argos , with an intention, not onely to repair to the new chosen Arch-Flamin, at the admirable and famous Town of Delphos , but hath declared her self since her coming hither, to be of the same opinion concerning the Worship of the Gods, and to that purpose was some few dayes since, received with wonderful Ceremony and magnificence, under this Jurisdiction and obedience; the relation of which particulars, I suppose will also be worth your knowledge: This being done, I shall take leave to finish my story to your no further trouble, because it was the onely reason of our present Triumphs in this City: The Ceremonies were performed the day before yesterday in our great Temple. The Queen being prepared in the morning for her Religious Reception, she was attended to the place by all the chief Magistrates of the City, where at the outermost gate, she was encountered, by the whole body of their Clergy, clothed in their Robes of Priesthood; who in publick there demanded of her what her intentions were: She presently answered, that as hitherunto during her life, she had not been in the true way of serving the Gods; so was she now come into Greece , with a full and positive intention, not onely to be better instructed in her private Devotions and common Sacrifices, but to put her person and obedience from this time forward, absolutely under the Jurisdiction of the great Flamin of Delphos ; whom as she now believed, had the Supreme Authority over all Temples and Congregations to that purpose: Upon this Reply, instantly they conducted her with certain Hymns, to a Throne inclosed by many Curtains, that in some sort obscured her from the view of the Common People, until at last being called to the high Altar by one of the chief Priests, that was sent by the Arch-Flamin to perform that Office, she kneeling down took an oath containing the several Articles of her Faith, which being ended, with a gesture both Majestick and Religious, she again returned to her seat, between two Princes of the Countrey, (who had also accompanied her in her voyage) there continuing until she saw performed a great Sacrifice, whilst in the interim a white Dove descended from the top of the Temple; which Ceremony was used, to expresse in some sort a supernatural conversion from her former errors and opinions. When all this was finished, no Street and Market place, but was filled with acclamations and Triumphs, according to that posture you found it in yesterday upon your arrival, having so continued ever since the Ceremonies I have related were performed: In conclusion, this morning Philogenia hath taken her further journey towards the stately City of Corinth , in pursuance of that more designed voyage of Delphos ; however in her way, she intends religiously to visit a certain famous Temple belonging to the Goddess Vesta , of all others most honoured in these parts, where also she determines to offer both her rich Crown and Scepter, employed at her late Coronation in the Scythian Kingdom, not being able to make a greater present, then in the absolute negation of what are held most precious by other worldly Monarchs, meerly for the thoughts and considerations of Religious Duties. This, Sir, is the full all (yet nothing but the truth) of what I can say, concerning this great and glorious Queen, who hath left to posterity, by this heroical act of piety, memorable examples to he followed by all future ages and people. With these words as Clytaphon finished his discourse, so did he put on two or three sighs with some appearing vehemency, as if he contemplated through her perfections, the decay of vertue in other persons, who onely for trivial losses, were afraid to demonstrate the same spirits in the Gods behalf. On the other side Arethusius sate for some space of time, as though he had been totally lost in a vaste sea of amazement, considering the particulars which had been related unto him, as well in regard of his own affairs, that seemed in some sort formerly to depend upon the power and pretentions of this great Queen, (since some Treaties of Marriage had passed between their Parents, according to the informations of his most dear Sister the Princess Cloria ) as also for that Philogenia , had not now left her self a capacity (according to his apprehension) any way to good his condition, either in her own power, or in her Countreys assistance; yet at last having belike spent the whole stock of his settled contemplation, he suddenly broke out into these expressions. Is it possible, said he, that all this can be done for Religion, when the world seems to be so stupified in that particular, that scarce can it be believed, there are any Gods in Heaven, or at the most that minde our actions upon earth? When Crowns and Scepters are purchased by nothing but injuries and oppression, never again to be restored to the right owners, but through seas of blood, or mountains of slaughtered people. Not long after these discourses, did they continue any communications, since the approaching night, seemed to invite them both to their most necessary employments, the one to his houshold affairs, the other to bethink himself of viewing the next day the curiosities of the City, and afterward to provide for his sudden departure, for that the remembrance of his sick Joyela , called his thoughts to a new consideration of her state and condition, which out of a noble gratitude in her behalf, he could not chuse but entertain, she having been a principal instrument to free him from the danger and hazzard of his life. As the great City of Argos appeared to Arethusius eyes, rather stately and ancient then effeminate and luxurious, so was it esteemed by all Greece , to be the chief Theatre of Temperance and Morality, for the instruction of people of other Nations: This gave him more then ordinary contentment, in that his own disposition naturally, seemed very much to comply in those particulars; who as I may say, rather was sad in his disposition, then over lightsome in his ordinary conversation; but whether occasioned by his cares and troubles, or proceeding out of the inclinations of his birth and breeding, remained a question in the opinions of those, that best knew him by any familiarity. A few dayes had onely past, when the Prince after he had fully beheld, what he could of rare and excellent in Argos, (with his Squire and Servant Parismenus ), resolved to take his journey again towards Athens , however another way then by which he came, in regard he had a desire, to avoid something the trouble of travel, intending to that purpose to pass a part thereof by sea: But in the interim, before he communicated his thoughts to Parismenus , it came into his minde, very often the strange passages of Philogenia the Scythian Queen, with all her admirable and unexampled adventures, concerning both her voyage and change of her Religion; wherein himself as he conceived had some part to play for his future advantage, as well for that which his Sister had told him, of the former motions of marriage between them by their Parents, as that he had also understood by Clytaphon , how she profest her actions to be intended towards the relief of distressed Princes: These reflections made him think it something necessary, however he intended not to visit the City of Delphos in his own person, not knowing how such a Pilgrimage contrary to the Lydian Faith, might be resented by divers of his followers and friends in other Countreys, when they should come to hear of an attempt to that effect, yet he thought it more then convenient, to employ Parismenus in the service, as well to finde out the principal intentions of her journey, as upon occasion to endear his concernments in the general, with that gallant Lady, since it was impossible as he believed, but that she must needs come to the understanding of his misfortunes, by divers relations from other people besides; he began also to consider, that some clearer light might be given, to those small Oracles he had already received, belonging to his own fate in Myssia , before that more powerful and famous God remaining at Delphos , which none was so fit to enquire after as a person of the same Religion, such as Parismenus was by his profest and open Declaration; insomuch as he determined without any obstacle, that not onely Parismenus should instantly take his journey by Land after the Queen, but for his better disguise and reception, he would change habits with him, being a a Robe appertaining to one of the Priests of the Temple of Hercules , that himself had made use of in his voyage of curiosity: Whilst in the mean time, according as he had formerly resolved, he intended alone to prosecute his own passage by sea to the City of Athens , where he had left distempered Joyela in a Cloyster of Nuns belonging to Minerva's Order; as within a day or two; Arethusius propounded his resolutions to the apprehension of his faithful servant Parismenus ; so was it not much longer before he undertook (being provided with some necessaries for that purpose) the execution of his commands; desiring also to be an eye-witness of the stately reception of the young Queen of Scythia , with her submissions to the mighty and most sacred Arch-Flamin of Delphos ; which sight could not again be parallel'd in the whole world, as he thought. When Prince Arethusius had in this manner dispatched away his servant Parismenus , again to meet him after some weeks respite at Athens , he lost no time to take order about the conveniencies of his own departure, according as he had formerly determined: To this purpose he hired a Ship belonging to the Town of Corinth , then riding in the Haven neerest to Argos , loaden with certain Goods, which were to be transported to other parts of Greece: Within a very few dayes, that this opportunity was found, the Prince mounted the Vessel, when a very prosperous winde seemed to carry her on in her intended voyage; but scarce was she come to the half way of her journey, having by reason of the fairness of the season, put her self to a competent distance from Land, in regard those Waters were much troubled with many scattering and dangerous Islands, of the sudden they might perceive a gallant Fleet sailing directly towards them from the North, as if they had passed the Hellespont, for the commodities of Traffick in some part of the Asian Continent: However this did not at all seem to fright their confident expectation, yet for that the windes appeared now to be something contrary to their purposes, so that in a manner they could make use of nothing but their Oars, they presently laid aside for that cause their industry and labour, intending to let the ships pass away before they would again fall to their work, whilst in the interim they all came upon the hatches to behold the sight. It was not much above an hours time, before the whole Fleet consisting of twenty Vessels arrived so near them, that they might easily perceive they were not onely belonging to the Jurisdiction of the Island of Cyprus , but more particularly appertained to the Town of Salamine, that belike were newly returned from their Trade of fishing in the black Sea, from whence yearly they were accustomed about this season, to repair homewards again with the profit and commodities they had procured in those parts: 'Tis true, when the Master of the Corinthian Vessel, became advertised of these particulars, he was was in some little confusion in his own thoughts, knowing there was no very good correspondency between his quarters of Greece , and the Island of Cyprus: However a long space was not given him for these considerations before a message was sent from the Fleet, to let him understand they were all to come aboard their Admiral Vessel, and in the interim to hale their Bark to the side of their ships, since they very well perceiv'd, as they said, they were of the Countrey of Peloponenses , which was a place that had heretofore prejudiced their Native Island of Cyprus , and more particularly the Haven Town of Salamine: though this peremptory command, seemed not at all to please any of the Passengers, much less the Master of the Boat, who had a good quantity of Merchandizes delivered to his Charge, to be transported from the parts about Argos to the City of Athens , yet were they forced speedily to yield to the injunction, for fear of a worse inconveniency by exasperating their spleen; wherefore without any delayes they performed what was required at their hands, since the power of any resistance was absolutely taken from all their hope, as to be able to escape in what sort soever from their pursuit, they having Vessels as they knew in their Fleet, purposely fitted for the fortune or opportunities of every manner of chase upon their enemies: When the Passengers arrived at the Ships, and the Admiral had caused the small Bark to be seized, they were presently examined one by one, of what Nation or Countrey they belonged unto: As soon as they came to Prince Arethusius , he told them, that as he had no affinity or relation to any Territory appertaining to the Grecian Government; so was it his own fortune onely by accident to be taken in the Vessel, amongst other persons going to Athens: He further let them know, thinking it would be his best defence and protection, that he was of Myssia by birth, and in his affections wholy addicted to the interest of King Euarchus , and his posterity: But contrary to his expectation, when he had named Euarchus ; the Captain as if he had been converted to a new spleen against his person for that very word, in naming the King, in some choller let him know, that he was resolved to put him on the Land, upon the Carian shore (in his further passage towards Cyprus ) there to be punished by that State, according to those late agreements had been made between the Lydians , and the City of Salamine: As Prince Arethusius could not but much wonder at this strange language of the Admiral, when at his last parting from the Island of Cyprus , there appeared no such correspondency of the Nations, but of the contrary rather an open war in the view of the world, so did he not hear until the present of the new accord, that had been published in the behalf of both the States, which had succeeded since his own departure from Paphos . 'Tis true, this intelligence did extreamly amaze the thoughts of the young Prince, but his courage and understanding, assisting where neither his fortune or his power could prevail, at last with much earnestness and solicitation he obtained of the Captain, to be carried a Prisoner into the Countrey of Cyprus , rather then to be landed in any of the Dominions belonging to the Lydian Commonwealth: However he effected thus much of his desire, by his behaviour and importunities, yet being after a while put under the hatches amongst the rest of the prisoners that were taken, something opprest by his own melancholly apprehensions, in a silent manner uttered, or more properly thought these complaints to himself. Is it possible Arethusius , thought he, that thy spiteful fates will never be weary of tormenting thy particular, with diversity of all manner of disasters? Was it not enough to have lost a father in the unhappy contentions of Lydia , at whose fall the very Heavens seemed to be at a stand, and the Sun to lose his light, but his surviving Children, should be turned into the world, as prodigies to be wondred at by all forts of people, for their new misfortunes? Can the unrelenting destinies be yet perswaded to no pitty or consideration, since the once most glorious Hiacinthia is onely constrained without fruit, to become a suppliant to other Princes, whilst in the interim, both treasons and disasters, conspire violently together to make thy self the prime object of all the disgraces, that mortality can undergo upon earth? Not onely being overcome by thy greatest enemies, but forced for safety to seek shelters in strange Countreys, where scarce remains the least shew either of relief or entertainment, when as disguises have rather protected thy person from total ruine, then procured courtesies of an ordinary nature amongst other States? O the accursed Son I may say, thou art of great Euarchus , into how many shapes have a few moneths turned thy condition, alone to maintain a loathed life, that better had been lost in that fatal and ominous Battle, where thou wert a miserable spectator, of so many of thy friends sacrificed for the interest onely of thy hopes and prosperity, whilst thy self became a fugitive to conserve that, which no other then a simple Virgin hath protected in obscurity? What now may the vertuous Joyela think of thy fidelity, when after so much travel, and hazzard undertaken for thy preservation, she is abandoned in unknown Countreys, there, as she will think, to be left forsaken by thy ingratitude or negligence? Can Parismenus thoughts be less scandalized at my intentions, when returning again from Delphos to Athens , he shall not onely finde me missing contrary to his expectation, but no intelligence to be had there, or in any other part of Greece , further of my purposes. These and the like mutinies in his minde, did the Prince silently utter to himself, whilst in the interim, after a long and rough voyage at Sea, the whole Fleet at last put in at the Haven of Salamine , belonging to the Island of Cyprus . In that place, although Prince Arethusius was not detained a Prisoner in so strict a manner, as the rest of the persons taken in the Ship, being of the Countrey of Greece , in regard he had profest himself upon examination, to be a Lydian by birth, he procured some conveniency to discourse with the people of the Town, who told him that Narcissus their great General, and Duke of Cyprus , was lately dead at Paphos in the same Island. This seemed again to seize his youthful bosome with new discontent, insomuch as tearing his hair, and beating his breast, he thought his own condition to be the most unfortunate, that could any way be found on earth; adding to his imagination, the other several passages of his life formerly complained of, as conceiving he had now scarce a friend in Asia , that either considered his wrongs, or would venture a considerable loss for his advantage: With these troublesome thoughts for many dayes together (however he discovered his minde particularly to no man) he would walk alone in the most obscurest places of the Haven, without speaking to any, as if the causes of his grief had enjoyned him a penance of perpetuall silence, until at last either being utterly tired with the hard effects of his seeming resolutions, or rather something enlightened out of that horrid Chaos of despair and confusion, he bethought himself of being yet better satisfied, both of the death of his Brother, and the condition of his Sister; to which purpose after a while, he singled out a certain Priest of the Town, who gave him this short account of the passages of Cyprus , since the death of King Euarchus , although he was not at all any way suspitious, that the Relations he made, were to any follower of his surviving Sonne. Although, said he, this Island in the general, seemed very much to resent at the first the King of Lydia's death, especially for that he was destroyed by his own people in so strange a manner, since the Subjects had taken upon them in a legal way to judge their Prince, whereby all Magistracy appeared to be in danger, of the like insolent example; yet this great Town of Salamine , alwayes most given to popularity, and therefore lesse affected to any peculiar Dignity, by the procurement of one Zutphynon , kept still a strict correspondency with the then Senate of Lydia , sitting at Sardis , which our late Duke Narcissus in the interim perceiving, conceiving belike that his Jurisdiction also might come in time to be questioned by the same rules of supposed and pretended Authority, began on a sudden, not onely to take upon him more power then formerly, but again very narrowly endeavoured to look into the actions of his enemies and opposers; but Zutphynon as he found of all others, shewing himself most forward to raise factions, he commanded to be imprisoned, untill a fit opportunity could be had, as well to punish him for his contempts, as to examine him concerning his Treasons: However our Prince had ground enough for these proceedings, and wanted not in his own person a sufficient power to make them good, yet many of this City which payes more of contribution to the State, then almost all the rest of the Countrey of Cyprus , began openly to exclaim against the Duke, as one (as they said) who had a design to overthrow the priviledges of the Nation, and bring an hereditary Monarchy upon the people, onely to continue in his own house and family, without either a general consent, or any particular election; and the better to fortifie their intentions, not onely sent again into Lydia , to renew their ancient amity belonging to Trade, and other compliances, but in a manner declared, that the people of Lydia had done well, so providently to call their King to an account for his actions and intentions, before he had altogether overwhelmed them and their liberties, by the pretensions of his vaste and unknown Prerogatives: Nevertheless for all these inward mutinies, no visible inflammations, appeared amongst the vulgar, but of the contrary, they seemed rather to take part with their Prince, as well in the revenge that was intended against the Lydian Nation, for the death of King Euarchus , as in regard of his own Jurisdiction and Command, which occasioned many differences and contentions at sea between the two Countreys of Lydia and Cyprus , most bloody and effectuall to the outward view of the world; insomuch as it was believed, no possibility remained of any reconciliation, to be had more between the people, since both seemed willful, obstinate, and exasperated; however this Town, with others of the same Faction (being opposite to the Prince in their hearts) laboured a peace underhand as much as they could; neither seldom betraying the secrets of our designs to the enemy for that effect. This I must needs say, not onely hindred our expected victories, but oftentimes procured us infinite losses, to the dishonour of the whole Nation in the general, chusing rather to hazzard the ruine of their Countrey, then they would put up their malice conceived against Narcissus and his House, notwithstanding in former ages, his Family and Predecessors had been the onely means, whereby we had gained so much from the King of Egypt: But whether or no, whilst our whole Countrey seemed to be involved in these disputes, the Gods being angry with our ingratitude, and therefore intended to bring a generall confusion upon the Island of Cyprus , or whether Zutphynon , with those of his particular faction, had contrived some underhand practice, whereby to be the sooner rid of the Jurisdiction of the Prince? of a sudden our young Duke Narcissus in the very flower of his age and greatness, was taken out of the world by no violent appearing Feaver in the beginning, though at last it encreased to huge flames of distemper; which in truth hath been the occasion ever since of divers passions in several sorts of people; however he left an Infant son after him, bearing his own Name; for as some seemed not onely exceedingly to grieve his loss, but strived with all their power presently to confer his Dignity and Royalties upon his succeeding Heir, notwithstanding he was not yet capable of Government in his minority, so others were more then industrious, to have assembled together the chief State of the Nation, whereby as they said, to order affairs in this unexpected change; neither wanted there a third sort amongst the Souldiers, who put them in minde of their former priviledges, which now being neglected, as they intimated would scarce ever be regained to their use and benefit. During these appearing Controversies, the fair Princess Cloria (whose tears and passions could not be almost parallel'd by any example in precedent times, though her new born Son gave some relaxation to her excessive grief continued her sadness in a quiet demeanour, without reproving the one, or taking part with the other, as well for that the Funeral Triumphs of her dearly beloved Lord, were not yet solemnized, according to the Customs of the Countrey, as that she was perswaded the great assembly of the Island meeting, without any difficulty at all, would be sure to put her childe into the same places of command, which his father enjoyed, to be executed in his particular, onely by such persons she should nominate and appoint in the future: Insomuch, as within a moneths time, all materials necessary being before prepared, the body of the dead Duke, with every circumstance belonging to greatness and Majesty, was brought out of his own Palace at Paphos , by most of the Nobility of Cyprus , to be committed to the Funeral Piles in the sight of all the people; in which procession no eyes were seen, but did pay a liberal tribute to his worth and remembrance, as well considering the brave actions he had performed, as their own loss which they had received, until it being at last staid as I may say, upon a Mountain of Wood and Spices, in a moment the artificial flames catching hold of that sweet though combustible matter, all that was mortal in an instant seemed to be consumed with fire, whilst of a sudden from the perfumed smoak, an artificial Eagle was seen by the multitude, to direct her flight towards the Heavens, bearing in her Tallons a lovely Cupid with gilded wings: 'Tis true, as many of his courageous Horses, were there according to the custom sacrificed to the honour of the Prince, so not a few of his servants and friends, paid their last love and duty to his remembrance, by their own voluntary deaths in the same place, to the amazement of the numerous people, that were here assembled to behold the final Ceremonies belonging to his Burial: Also within a very short time, another Monument was raised to his glory, composed of Grannet stones, fetcht from the neighbouring Countrey of Egypt , which to the beholders spoke this Epitaph in Capitall Letters of Gold.  Though Cyprus fates do look with dire aspects, In loss of such a Prince, yet fame erects A Monument so great and wondrous high, It toucheth Jove , and claims eternity: 'Tis so the Gods have made the purchase even, They would have him that he should sit in heaven. But if the peoples Rule be at a stand, Chuse but his infant son, he will command By some blest power; his Fathers soul Can help his years in Justice to controul, And conquer too; that so the world may see Fair Cloria's Blood must not resisted be. Notwithstanding these glorious Triumphs I must tell you, and many plentifull promises from all sorts of conditions in the Island of Cyprus , yet when this long expected assembly were met together in the City of Paphos , instead of presently creating the young Prince, their general Commander over the headless Souldiers, they began not onely to dispute his fathers actions and authority, but took upon them a Prerogative over his estate and person: In the one alledging, that Duke Narcissus had no lawful Jurisdiction, but what proceeded from the grants of the people; and in the other, they seemed to have a care of his minority, and to that purpose intended to dispose of his youth, according to their pleasures. You need not doubt, but that these appearing insolencies, did more then afflict the already too much grieved Princess Cloria , who had not onely undergone an unrepairable loss, by the late death of her gallant husband, but was now likely to be deprived anew of her chief comfort young Narcissus ; and the rather were her troubles encreased, in regard her Lords mother (who was yet living) being a woman of more envy and passion, then of birth and quality, to equal her pretences, laboured with the Senate, as well to raise factions against the Princess Cloria's desires, as to have the sole Jurisdiction over the yong Duke: 'Tis true, these differences after a while seemed to be laid asleep, for that it now became a main question in this general, if not ungrateful assembly, whether or no they would have any more Princes of the family to succeed in after ages? since they had happily as they said, freed themselves from a dangerous bondage, as the people in their own Rights, ought to claim a freedom of all elections of this nature, for that their purses maintained both the glory and the safety of the Island: Some moneths past in these contentions, when as the forementioned Zutphynon , being not onely a principal instrument in the Councel, but an underhand enemy to the house of Narcissus , endeavoured by all means possible, to make a reconciliation between our Countrey, and the Government of Lydia , which as he supposed, would both strengthen his particular pretension, and weaken very probably his adversaries power; insomuch as by that stratagem (continuing still the Island of Cyprus in a common Government) himself stood alwayes to be the chief person to sit at the stern: However the multitude who favoured exceedingly the titles of the young Duke (considering the benefits they had for many years received, both by the industry and valour of his noble ancestors) with some fury oftentimes seemed to contend, as well against the Councel as the intention, yet being out- craftied by those of Zutphynons faction and interest, were at last either perswaded or compelled to yield to the advice; so that presently Ambassadours were dispatched into Lydia to that effect: I cannot say, notwithstanding these messengers imployed, that instantly any agreement was made between the two Nations; for ours not willing to trust the power, and less the proceedings of the great Senate sitting at Sardis , in regard of their inconstant cruelty and friendship used to all sorts of people whatsoever, were desirous to finde out some way for their best security and advantage, before they should conclude of any accord certain and lasting; but whilst the Treaty continued, (every one expecting either a final end, or a farther breach, between the Countrey of Lydia , and the Island of Cyprus ) Hercrombrotus the fortunate General of the Lydian Forces and that ample Territory, was elected the chief Governour of all those Countries, after having by the power and interest of the Army, dissolved that long and tedious Assembly, which in all the time of their sitting, as 'twas said, had scarce procured the good word of any man (according as I have been informed by some of of our Countreymen, who had remained at Sardis for many years together) and much less had they performed what acts soever, either of goodness or indifferency to the people, notwithstanding they had undone all their Kings party after his destruction. To be short, within a very small space of this new establishment, Articles of Peace were also concluded by our Ambassadours, with certain Commissioners appointed by Hercrombrotus ; however as I may say to the extream disadvantage of Prince Arethusius , the eldest Son to your late King; which make many not onely to wonder in these parts, but a few to be very sad and discontented at the agreement, since by those contracts we of the Island of Cyprus , are strictly obliged to have no correspondency with his affairs, much less to give any entertainment to his person in our Countrey; all which I might suppose you have heard of before, if you had not told me at the beginning of my discourse, that notwithstanding you are a Lydian by birth, yet you have been imployed in forreign parts for something a long season, and so consequently could not come conveniently to intelligences from your own native Countrey, which hath made my relations longer then they should have been, as mixing them more particularly with your affairs. When the Priest had made an end of his discourse, all the answer that Arethusius gave him, was onely in two or three deep sighs, accompanied with some few tears gently dropping down from his Princely eyes, until at last better remembring himself (as being the best subject he could now treat upon) he suddenly asked him what was become of the Princess Cloria in these transactions? since it was not to be doubted, as he said, but that she was a well-willer both to her Fathers Family, and her Brothers Succession: Truly replyed the Priest, as that great and good Lady, bore all these transcendent crosses and oppositions, with no small courage and fortitude, yet it cannot be denyed, but her passions, with the occasions of them, principally coming from those she had most honoured with her person and conversation, have for the present put upon her condition such an apparent sadness, as makes many believe she will hardly undergo the effects without some desperate change, either in her health or senses; and the rather for that her old Governess Roxana is lately dead, who was accustomed, ever to be a most intimate councellour of her youth; however the birth of her late Son gives her a great relaxation in her many distempers, and would do much more, if the unkinde and ungrateful people of Cyprus , were inclinable to remember those extraordinary benefits they have from time to time received, both of his Father, and his Ancestors. In conclusion, the Princess her self, with her Childe, for the instant, remains at a Castle of her own, not far from the City of Paphos , expecting still what may be the further determination of the general Assembly, as well concerning their particular establishment, as the Government of the whole Countrey, upon which also many other eyes are attentively fixed; but more especially those of our profession, (who for the most part are addicted to the prosperity of the Royal and Illustrious House of Narcissus , since by that means onely the Island (as we believe) will be kept either from popular factions, or particular usurpations; besides the former order of Priesthood may be preserved from contempt, if not destruction, occasioned by reason of the many new opinions, and forreign interests, daily arising amongst our very Rulers themselves, in the mannaging of State Affairs; although I cannot deny, but this Town where I now remain, of all others is most subject, both to oppose the Princes proceedings, and make a rupture in the established Government belonging to their former Dukes, as knowing best their great strength, and riches, which makes them presume of carrying a sway over the rest of the Cities and Provinces in Cyprus ; to which purpose, they entertain the stricter correspondency with the Territories of Lydia , that have lately not onely taken away the jurisdiction, but destroyed their King. This communication and discourse being ended, they soon parted one from another. Arethusius whose thoughts could not be but very solicitously entertained, concerning these passages, resolved without any delay (if he by what means soever, was able to free himself of his present engagement) to seek out the Princess Cloria his Sister, in her obscurity and retirement. To this effect, as at Sea coming from Argos , he had been taken a prisoner amongst the rest, by the people of Salamine , where he now remained; so within a while, in regard he was esteemed to be a Lydian Subject, and the composition and agreement lately made between the two Countries, he became quickly discharged from his confinement; insomuch as again disguising his person in the habit of a Priest belonging to his own Nation, he took his journey towards the Territory of Paphos , where the Castle stood, in which lived both the Princess and her Son: 'Tis true, the place however guarded by some Souldiers, yet the privateness of the dwelling, seemed to put on a certain kinde of melancholly aspect, by reason of the death of its former Lord the Duke of Cyprus: Many dayes it was before Prince Arethusius could come to the sight of his sorrowful Sister; yet at last meeting with the Page (who had been the instrument of her escape out of Lydia ) he told him, that he was a Chaplain of her Brothers, who could certifie her both of his welfare and abode, however the late agreement made between the people of Cyprus and the Lydian State, had hindred him in person to enter into the Island, for fear of being delivered up according to those contracts into his enemies power and possession. There needed no other motives to carry the youth with haste into the Princess Chamber, who commanded him not long after to conduct Arethusius thither in his disguise; since Cloria by any means could hear tiding of his safety and escape, since the loss of that unfortunate Battle in the Countrey of Lydia , fought between himself and Hercrombrotus , now chief Lord and Governour established in those Territories. Upon his entring into the Princess presence, he found her seated in a most mourning posture, the room having scarce light for the persons that necessarily attended her service, to perform their several offices with any manner of conveniency; onely her self was retired into a small nook thereof, with a kinde of an obscure Lamp, that did but afford her the benefit continually, to behold a Picture drawn to the life of her dear, and dead Husband Narcissus , which procured from her fair eyes such plentiful showers of tears, as sufficiently demonstrated the inward sorrow and passions of her heart; which her attendants notwithstanding endeavoured, as often as they could to remove from her sight, on purpose to divert if possible, the object of her grief; however many times of the day, she would call for the same Portraicture again, as if the view of her affliction, had been the likeliest means to cure her distempers; nothing shewing more the frailty of mortality, then to hope to procure the best remedy of evils, by entertaining the chiefest subject of our smart, in a continual remembrance; as if the feeling of our grief, were a means to take away the pain, onely because we too much loved, what we can never more enjoy; for however we may have no confidence at all in miracles, yet the strength of our desires, makes us still hope in something, that possibly in our nature or our reason we cannot believe; whereas resolved patience is alone the cure, and that of all other things we are furthest off from putting in practice to our perpetual torment; so it fared with this sweet Princess, who having lost her chiefest comfort, endeavoured to get it again by alwayes remembring what she had unfortunately been deprived of: In conclusion, when Arethusius approached the sight of his thus afflicted and dear Sister, she presently fixed her eyes upon him (though in such a manner) as if her thoughts expected no more consolation in earthly satisfaction; notwithstanding she could not but express in her countenance, some joy to behold any person that came with assurance of her Brothers safety, and in that sort after a while saluted him: But Arethusius beginning but to speak, as if some kinde of a heavenly influence had flowed from his words, whereby the better to instruct her knowledge, she suddenly cryed out, and are you indeed then, the much loved and the long desired Arethusius? O Gods said she, I thank you for your mercies, which in part may take off from my despairs, the heavy weight that hath lain upon my imagination, since Narcissus death: The Prince perceiving that his Sister knew him, notwithstanding his intended cunning disguise, went presently and kist her with a thousand affections; but as he was using other congratulations towards her satisfaction, he might still behold a sad showre of tears, that proceeded by violence from the beauty of her eyes, that gently running down her lovely cheeks, made many fair paths, whereon blessed souls might have walked to the Celestial Court of Jove , until at last (although not wearied with grieving, yet ceasing for a time to grieve the better) complying with his entertainment, she invited him into another room more commodious; however in the way they both agreed, not to make his person yet publickly known: The communication that past between them that night, was of each of their adventures since their last parting; and the conclusion consequently, that Cloria would receive her Brother into her Castle, onely as a Priest of Lydia , formerly belonging to the Court of Arethusius ; who having lost his Lord and Master he knew not where, was constrained to seek this relief for his subsistance; which the better to cover from others knowledge, that evening they devised some new alteration of his person, with other pretty inventions fit for the purpose, in regard the Island of Cyprus had lately made that dishonourable accord with the State of Lydia , to give no reception to any of the Royal Family into their Countrey, without some general licence granted them to that effect: Although Prince Arethusius lived in this manner for some time with security enough, under the protection of the Castle of his sweet Sister, who in the interim brought her a world of consolation, by his frequent and discreet counsels and conversation, yet being perswaded, that it would not be alwayes for his honour, thus to continue without entering into action, he resolved as soon as he could to leave Cyprus ; the rather, for that he understood the new King of Scythia , performed admirable conquest in the Territories of Trapasus , by the reason of their willing revolt, from the jurisdiction of their former Prince; however the Town it self seemed to retain still an inclination of obedience, which in a kinde drew the Scythians to the intentions of a formal Siege: From this Princes assiance, I say, Arethusius hoped to procure some relief, concerning his present necessities, either by solicitation or interest, since it was well known Philogenia their late Queen, had oftentimes declared affections in his behalf: But notwithstanding these might be his inward imaginations, yet he resolved not yet, to make known his determinations to his most dear Sister, who however she was become something better tempered in her grief, by reason of his presence, nevertheless he found she was not absolutely cured of her disease; for that not seldom in melancholly fits, she would retire for many hours together, into some private and obscure Cabinet, there to converse alone; onely in the language of sighs and tears, with the dead Picture of her for ever lost Narcissus , until at last there hapned an occasion contrary to his expectation, which was this: Upon the sudden and prosperous conquest of Dagalphus King of Scythia , the people of the Island of Cyprus , conceived not onely a jealousie, that he would utterly deprive them of their trading upon the Pontick Seas, but was also sent by the inhabitants of the City of Trapasus , to lend them a willing assistance for the maintenance of their Town, against all hostility should be used, which as they said, was but a necessary providence to be thought upon by both Nations, since their intercourse with one another, might probably come to be hindred by the prosperous progresses, the Scythians had already made in those parts, and other Dominions belonging to the Armenian Crown: As this intelligence administred new discourses, throughout the whole Island of Cyprus , so did Arethusius make it, not onely some advantage towards his own departure, doubting a few hopes were remaining for him in the Island of Cyprus , now Narcissus was dead, and the Subjects having made so strict an accord with the State of Lydia , but also became an occasion, for him to perswade his Sister Cloria in like manner to leave the Countrey: 'Tis true, upon the first overture of the business, this seemed to be a desperate advice, but considering her young son in her absence, would receive a careful protection under the power and jurisdiction of his Grandmother, and that her own personal presence, rather procured faction and jealousie, then any assistance whatsoever, she resolved to accompany her Brother in his travels and other fortunes, whereby to obtain some powerful relief, from the King of Scythia , again to establish young Narcissus in his Fathers honours or command, against he should arrive to those years, that might render him capable of the Dignity by practice, as well as by name, which hitherunto her enemies in the Island of Cyprus had hindered him from. Notwithstanding in the general, both Cloria and Arethusius , had determined between themselves some particulars, yet they kept it private from others knowledge, especially that to leave Cyprus with all expedition; neither had they fully digested the manner how, since as they wanted convenient supplies for the journey, so would it breed (as they thought) some jealousie amongst the Countrey people, in regard of those differences that were likely to arise from the Scythians , concerning their late conquests about the City of Trapasus , in which place the inhabitants of the Island, had long enjoyed a plentiful and beneficial trade, which now they were likely to be debarred of, by reason Dogalphus the King exacted new customs from all persons traffiquing into those parts. Nevertheless within a while they solved these doubts in this manner; for the first they resolved to engage their Jewels, to some rich Merchants of the Countrey, whereby to furnish themselves with necessary supplies for the intended voyage; and for the other, they intended to pretend, that the Princess Cloria , by the occasion of her excessive grief, had contracted many desperate imperfections and distempers in her health, which could not any way be so conveniently cured, as by the means of travel and diversions, with the help of those pure waters, which flowed from a clear fountain in the pleasant Valleys of Daphane , between the Territories of Syria and Armenia , consecrated as was said to the God Pan , for their excellency and operation. As these motives appeared sufficient satisfactions, to the willing apprehensions of Arethusius and his Sister, so did not Cloria's desires in this particular, want probable entertainments in the thoughts of the Majestrates of Cyprus ; but more especially were they welcomed in the minde of the Grandmother of young Narcissus , who imagined by this voluntary absence, not onely to allay all factions in the Island, concerning the education and Government of the Infant Duke, but also within a short space after the departure of her Daughter-in-law, to be able her self alone, to bear what jurisdiction she pleased over the whole Countrey, since she believed it was onely the Lydian interest, that hindred the Narcissan Family from making a prosperous progress in those designs, that tended again to the establishment of the young Duke in his predecessours ancient dignity and command amongst the people; insomuch as within a few moneths, Cloria and Arethusius having fitted all their conveniency for the journey, the Princess was conducted with Ceremony enough (accompanied by all her train) towards the Sea side, where waited already a couple of gallant Ships, for her transportation, into the neighbouring shores of the lesser Asia , intending afterwards to pass by Land to the Groves and delicious places of Daphene , near unto which Territory, were the famed Wells in certain craggy Mountains, belonging to a Forrest called Ardanus , where inhabited many wilde and Savage Beasts of divers sorts and kindes. When they were upon the Waves, the God Neptune seemed pleased to have the dominion over their journey; for as the windes continued prosperous for their purpose, so scarce did a billow move below to give them any manner of incommodity or disturbance, until they arrived upon the shores of Pamphylia , where the Egyptians had made great preparation to give the Princess Cloria entertainment; and the rather, for that lately there had happened a quarrel between those Countries and the Lydian interest, however young Arethusius went yet disguised under the nature, and quality of his Sisters servant: 'Tis true, notwithstanding the Magistrates of those Towns, as they passed, attended with Ceremony to conduct them in their journey; yet Cloria her self, was more reserved in her carriage to the inhabitants, then otherwise she would have been, (though she never failed of her civilities) lest the Kingdom of Syria should in any sort thereby, become over jealous of her affections, demonstrated towards their enemies, which was the reason as it was thought, why she made no more stay under the Egyptian Dominions, then was meerly necessary, either for her repose or provision; however for the more commodity of the Fleet, they were compelled to land in those Territories: This was the misfortune of Arethusius , and his Sisters condition, that as neutralities could bring them no considerable assistance, so more then ordinary applications, afforded too many causes of suspicion from other Princes; especially in those unreconcilable differences between Orontes and his esteemed adversaries of Egypt . But the pleasant Vallies and Woods of Daphene , were held most indifferent for their abode, as well to avoid future jealousies concerning other States, as to procure present conveniency for the subsistence of themselves; not onely in regard the Territory belonged to the jurisdiction of an Arch-Flamin of Armenia , but that the place was near a Principality, which appertained to Philogenia Queen of Scythia , and therefore proper upon all occasions, either for meetings or other addresses. To describe those Groves and Fountains in each particular, were a labour difficult for any pen; onely it must suffice, that the Goddess Diana might there have taken up her delightful habitation, either for her sports or retirement, as Vesta had furnished it with many stately Temples, and Cloysters for her own service; besides those waters formerly mentioned were at no great distance: Thither at last the noble couple came, attended with such a train, as rather complyed with their conveniency, then pretended to any ostentation, for that they desired the world should onely take notice of their necessities, and no wayes become admirers of their State and Dignity, since envy was not to be procured upon any condition: Before their arrival Prince Arethusius did not reveal himself, and then also by little and little he withdrew the mask from before his person, as if chance had brought him to his Sisters company by accidental adventures, and no designs hitherunto had continued him for any time in the Island of Cyprus ; yet had they not long remained in this solitude, expecting a return from some messengers, they had sent to Dogalphus the new King of Scythia , who was busily imployed about the confirmation of his late conquests, before they were suddenly saluted by the personal presence of Creses , as it should seem dispatched many moneths since by the Queen Hyacinthia from Damascus , as well to congratulate the election of the great Flamin of Delphos , being an essential point as she thought belonging to her Religion, as more particularly to enquire of the Oracle concerning the fortunes and safety of her Son Arethusius , for that she had heard nothing of him or his affairs, since the defeat of his Army by Hercrombrotus in the Kingdom of Lydia , and now was returning again from Delphos by Land into Syria , through the Countries of the lesser Asia: Prince Arethusius being extream passionate to understand from Creses , the present passages of that famous City, the rather in respect of the account he expected concerning Parismenus and Joyela , the next morning, when his Sister Cloria was retired amongst the Vestal Virgins, to perform some usual devotions, and sacrifices belonging to her dead Lord Narcissus , he walked with Creses by a fair River side, that beautified exceedingly those delicious Plains and Vallies, where at last coming to a Grove of Trees, that nature seemed to have framed for a principal place of delight to entertain mortality, having seated himself for the purpose in a certain leavy shade, which covered them entirely from Phoebus oppression, Creses began in order to recount the progresses he had made in this manner. Sir, said he, as the Queen your Mother being out of all patience, that she could hear nothing of your abode, after that unfortunate defeat was given to your Forces by Hercrombrotus the Lydian General, in the end resolved, to send me from Damascus by Sea into Greece , as well to salute the great Flamin there newly elected, as to enquire more particularly of that Oracle, not onely what was become of your person, but how the Gods would dispose of your fortunes: 'Tis true upon my arrival I found the time taken up wholly in the reception and entertainment of the young Queen of Scythia , which because it was more rare and magnificent then ordinary, I shall make you a kinde of exact relation thereof, before I proceed to other particulars: Upon her entering the City of Delphos , the chief Flamins and best Magistrates of the Town were commanded to conduct her to the great Temple; (a Fabrick of so rare a structure, that it appears to be a work of such wonder, both for its beauty and extent, that the world cannot again parallel the same) which they performed with so exact a Decorum, that the order of the shew pleased the spectators more then the State: When she arrived at the gate of the Temple, being descended from her horse, the onely posture she was advised to use, making her first entrance for her better applications both to the people and company, she might behold the great Flamin himself sitting on a Throne, however it pretended not so much to Majesty and Glory, as to Reverence and Devotion; wherefore approaching to his presence with an humility answerable to his venerable aspect, she kist the ground twice or thrice, before she could either reach his person or his speech, until at last coming so near, that conveniently she might perform her adorations, she humbly prostrating her self in his sight delivered this language; As the Gods, said she, have recalled me from my errours, to be sanctified by your fatherly benedictions, so do I vow for ever to be obedient to your commands, according to that power and with those rules given you from Olimpus : At the words he presently imbraced her in his armes, and gently lifting her from off the earth whereon she kneeled, thus spake unto her; Daughter said he, as the great God Apollo hath been pleased to place me in this dignity for his service, so would I have you to know, that nothing of my protection shall be wanting, either for your future happiness, or present honour, since your piety hath forsaken Crowns and Scepters, whereby the better to purchase eternity: These Ceremonies being finished, the Arch-Flamin went instantly and offered an Hecatomb to all the Gods, both for her safety and prosperity, whilst in the interim the admiring people sent up to heaven with loud acclamations, as well their joy, as their supplications. In this manner for that time ended the religious triumphs, accompanied with sound of Trumpets and other pastimes belonging to the multitude: After all the performance of these more solemn Ceremonies, there was provided for her entertainment, and other divertisements, such as were most correspondent to her youth, dignity, and education. To this purpose sometimes she was presented with several shews of sundry natures, wherein were set forth, not onely the manner and worth of her conversion, as if she had been thereunto inspired, meerly by the Gods power, and the influence of the heavens; other whiles again she was observed to retire her self for two or three dayes together, onely to converse with her own private devotions; then was she visited by all the Ladies and great personages of the City, with whom she communicated with that freedom, though reservedly in what belonged to her dignity, that easily it might be perceived, however she knew her own quality, when she had a minde any way to value it, notwithstanding she was willing out of her natural goodness alwayes to be courteous and loving. Last of all, after she had viewed all the Temples and antiquities of the Town, she appeared publickly in many Schools amongst the Philosophers, to hear and understand their disputations, with whom also oftentimes, would she argue of things Moral and Divine. These Sir, I may say, were the chief imployments of Philogenia at my being at Delphos , whilst in the interim it was my fortune to meet with Parismenus , the young messenger, which you had sent from Argos , to acquaint you with the passages of the Queens reception. O Gods, with what a transcendent joy, did my heart entertain the news of your safety and escape, imagining then you would be quickly possessour of all your Kingdoms and Royalty, since the destinies had been already so favourable to your particular, concerning your preservation in the Battle, esteeming my own travels nothing now, being I had by accident met with so fortunate and blessed a knowledge: 'Tis true, I asked Parismenus many impertinent questions, proceeding rather from the abundance of my joy, then out of any need at all I had of further satisfaction; however we concluded hoth notwithstanding, to be very punctual in searching the Oracle, in those things, that belonged to your future prosperity, as also what might be the fates of your Royal Sister, with the rest of the Family: nevertheless some weeks passed before we could meet with the opportunity, not onely in regard the time generally was spent in many other Ceremonies, appertaining to the entertainment of the Queen of Scythia ; in that the Priests belonging to the Temple were not at leasure, but also for that the great concourse of people to obtain the new Jubile, obstructed in a manner all private and particular designs to that purpose; however at last by the help of a few special friends, and a competent summe or Gold we offered upon the Altars, we procured means to receive these Predictions from the sacred Oracle.  Though Myssian falshood shall their King destroy, And all the Land soon after made a prey; Yet Fates decree, there must again arise Another Vertue of a greater prize: The Syrian Wife in time hath born a Son, Whose Victories through every place shall run, Till he have conquered new unto his Crown The Asian Government, and got renown: But for a while he must be forc't to lie, Expecting help, descending from the Skie. And when those mighty Kings in peace agree, Cyprus may hope another Lord to see, Which shall again his Fathers Honour raise, By his sole Monarchy for after dayes. These Sir, I say, were the Prophecies, as near as I can remember, which the God of Delphos pronounced with an audible voice, although accompanied by a certain kinde of murmuring winde, according to the custom of the place, proceeding from the hollowness of the ground, in that vaste Cave upon the Mountain, where the Image of Apollo stands supported by a great pedestate of Corinthian Brass: In the first of the prediction (as I conceive) you may look upon your own happy fate, as in the latter part, no doubt what concerns the prosperity of your dear Sister, and her little Son, however according to my interpretation, much consists in composing those mighty differences between Orontes and the Egyptian King, that seem at present to make all the world at a gaze; to which purpose notwithstanding the great Flamin , (as I was informed when I was in Greece ) intends to send two principal messengers from his own Court, with full authority to propose to each Prince particular terms of agreement; for not onely both their quiets and advantage, but for the better settling of unity and peace within all the Territories of the lesser Asia: When we had performed these offices, and received other intelligences most proper as we thought for your service, I more particularly addressed my self to Queen Philogenia , as well to desire her in her private conferences with the Arch-Flamin , to remonstrance unto him, the injuries you had received by your own people, in being kept so wrongfully out of your hereditary Dominions, as that she would be a means to procure your affairs, some assistance from her fortunate and prevailing Kinsman the new King of Scythia . To which she quickly returned me this answer: That as she did much condole your losses, and would endeavour you all the satisfaction she could procure, either from her Kinsman or other Princes, so was she in her heart so much in love with your excellent vertues, that she not onely desired extreamly to be acquainted with your person; but kept alwayes in a Cabinet a certain Picture of yours, which an Ambassadour of her Countrey some years ago, had brought her out of Lydia , when he was imployed in those parts to the King your Father, remaining then in the very height of all his prosperities: These incouragements I must confess, made me hasten my journey towards the City of Athens , where I was told by Parismenus you would be undoubtedly arrived, before we could possibly repair to the place: But contrary to our expectations, when we thought to have enjoyed the happiness of your presence in that goodly and famous Town, we could not hear the least news of your abode; insomuch as presently with sadness enough, we dispatched a messenger to the City of Argos , whereby to be better informed, as well of your safety as determinations. But in the interim, whilst we were attending the return of the person we had sent about this enquiry, there fell out another accident, which I shall relate unto your Highness. One day as we were making our melancholly perambulations about the City, by reason of your absence, there came of a sudden to Parismenus , a certain woman clothed in a Vestal habit who accompanied by some circumstances told him, that after a tedious and troublesome sickness, the Lady Joyela (the same person that had secured your passage out of the Countrey of Myssia ) was now dead to the world, wherein she conceived the immortal Gods had done her a special favour, since she seemed to expire most happily under the protection of the great Goddess Minerva: So that if we pleased the next morning, we might repair to the Cloyster, whereby to be some assistants to her intended Funerals: With these words she quickly took her leave, as if she had had other business that required her haste; It is not to be imagined, with what a trembling confusion poor Parismenus entertained this unexpected intelligence, for that since his coming to Athens , he was advertised (however he could not be admitted to her sight) that in a manner she had been perfectly recovered of her former distempers, who belike was (though then I knew it not) most deeply engaged to her person by his affections, which made me at the present I must confess, as well to pitty his condition, as to wonder at his passions; but however, after a while with some labour and perswasions of mine own, having again recovered part of his wonted temper, we resolved both on the morrow, to be, not onely spectators, but agitators in those holy Ceremonies, that were to be used in her behalf; my self in regard of my obliged charity to all persons of that nature and profession, and Parismenus , out of the secret love which he had so long a time concealed in his heart, towards the perfections of that young and most vertuous Lady. Notwithstanding Parismenus laboured that night extreamly under his passions, yet in the morning something early, according to our determination, we went together to the Temple of Minerva , (seated for the more state, if not better commodity) upon the very top of a hill, which so over-looks the Town, that it takes also a most perfect view of the sea, though at a far greater distance: The place it self was encompassed round about (onely leaving a delightful entrance) with thick and shady Trees, composed artificially into many Groves, which pretended to recollection of spirit, as most proper for the devout intentions of those inhabitants, who had dedicated their lives wholly to the Gods service. For the structure in the general, it was for the most part built of white Theban Marble, so neatly framed with imagery, that scarce was there a Deity in Olympus , that was not there very lively represented to the sight and apprehension. A gallant Portico gave the first access to the Temple, supported with sundry stately Pillars of Corinthian work, all which together intirely covered the rest of the building, belonging to the private lodgings of the Religious Women: Upon our nearer approach, we found the gates wide open, not onely for us, but all others that had a minde to be partakers of those supposed last Ceremonies, belonging to a stranger Lady, which was imagined would be entertained with the more curiosity. We had not long employed our time in beholding the Altars and other rich furnitures of the Temple, but the Religious Women themselves issued out two by two from behinde the great Sanctuary, where the common sacrifices were usually performed, modestly marching, as I may say, in a solemn and orderly procession, carrying each one a silver Censer in their hands, whilst many of them offered perfumes all the way as they went, singing Hymns to their great Goddess and Patron Minerva . The becomming Garments of these Religious Virgins were white Linnen, which they wore, covered with Veils of black Cypress ; insomuch, as both their habits and their countenances represented to the spectators, not onely Devotion, but Majesty. After this holy procession followed one cloathed after the modern fashions, her face being entirely obscured from the view of the people, by a certain Scarf neatly tied about her neck in a pretty knot; her hair was combed to the full length, which being drest with flowers and rows of small Pearl, reached down her back almost to the ground, here and there united together by Ribbands of divers colours. When they had fully performed those convenient Ceremonies belonging to the season, they all made a stand, and with it presently casting themselves into a ring, the young Damsel was suddenly placed in the midst of all the company, where putting her body into a modest posture upon her knees, she made towards the high Altar with her looks, some silent prayers to the Goddess Minerva their chief Patroness: This also being finished, the old Governess, after having delivered a few words before the company for her future instruction, with a pair of shears, which she had there ready prepared for that purpose, cut off the fair Tresses of her hair, to the apparent resentment of most of the standers by, who esteemed those treasures of more value to be preserved for natures ornament; when each Nunn, as it were, carried by a hasty violence, made speed to despoil her of her apparel, as if they envied her former living so long a time in beauty, to the worlds glory, until at last being thus totally dismantled of all her chief riches, and cloathed in other Robes, she cast her self again upon the earth, whilst a large mourning Coverture was flung over her person, that pretended to bury her from the thoughts and desires of what concernment soever, that spoke any thing to her apprehension, but penance and retirement. These doleful Circumstances made the spectators shed many tears, feeling not belike within their breast those flames, which are accustomed to kindle new devotions in such Religious People; however Parismenus , who expected more lamentable triumphs, stood still fixed without much alteration; when the supposed buried Virgin of a sudden, rising from that seeming bed of death, with her face now wholly discovered, wherein appeared a countenance wholly divided between the beauty of Venus , and the chastity of Diana , in a demure and graceful march went towards the lower end of the Temple, where my self and Parismenus were placed, which being perceived by him, (coming so near, that easily she might be known by him, to his no small amazement) he was advertised, the Lady was no other then his living Joyela , now having taken upon her the absolute profession of that holy Order, wherein many other noble and young Maids remained, who had during their lives consecrated their chastity to the intire service of the great Goddess Minerva ; but yet to make the representation a little more certain, whilst Parismenus in a trembling posture, beheld as he thought, this strange vision, she saluted him with this language, breaking from the Ruby of her Lips, the people in the interim earnestly attending the issue. Sir, said she, being obliged by the strictness of my vow, and commanded by my superiours, to give satisfaction to all that have formerly been acquainted with my conversation, (Prince Arethusius not now present in this City to honour our Ceremonies, whose person I have desired to serve, since he first set footing in the unfaithful and unfortunate Countrey of Myssia ) I have made choice of your self upon your next conveniency, to carry with you to his knowledge the relation of this my sudden conversion, as well by reason he seems to be of a contrary belief, as that in our travels to this place he had some taste of my carriage and fidelity; which if you please (besides what you have seen with your own eyes) you may recount after this manner: As the Gods decrees are not to be understood, much less, said she, can they be contradicted by any power, so must I desire, that neither himself or any other, so much to injure my election, as to repine at this my unexpected change from the world to heaven, especially since these inclinations have lasted in my breast, almost ever since my very infancy; but whether growing up with education, or proceeding from some supernatural inspiration, I shall not need at present any way to go about to determine; onely let it suffice, that the holy and venerable Governess of these Cloisters, dedicated to the great Goddess Minerva , expounding to me during my sickness, a certain Prophesie, which I brought with me out of Myssia , accompanied by the example of so many vertuous lives I saw led in this Sanctuary, have so far perswaded my reason, and prevailed against my passions, that as you see, I am wholly converted from any more worldly resolutions other then those, that may meerly and solely consist with the orders and decorum of this sacred Temple, where a Virgin I intend to remain all the dayes of my life, in such exercises and contemplations, as shall be best pleasing to the immortal Gods; however more particular to our great and glorious Patroness, the holy and powerful Goddess Minerva , whose protection we esteem to be the safety and guard of this ancient and learned Town of Athens . When she had delivered thus much, she parted from Parismenus , with a countenance, that seemed equally mixed between compassion and resolution; however she smiled with so sweet a grace, as if her confidence in the Gods service concerning the choice she had made, was sufficient to render her happy against all obstacles, not onely for the present, but during the remainder of her years she was to spend in this world. Then instantly mingling her self again with her company, she left him without any opportunity for Reply; and in that manner after the procession was finished, entred the Cloysters with the rest of her Religious Sisters: Parismenus , when he had stood, as it were, wholly confounded in his imaginations with the apprehension of this strange conversion, at last looking upon me, though with a kinde of a forced smile, he broke out suddenly into these expressions. Well, most sweet and gallant Joyela , said he, although I have not been at all deceived in thy vertues, yet I must confess my self to have been much mistaken in thy determinations; nevertheless, the world shall see, that however I was not worthy of thy love, yet that love was worthy to make me a Convert to the best affections can be produced from the Heavens: After this, without speaking one word more, he accompanied me to our lodging in a silent way and most melancholly posture, where also I could not perswade him long to remain, in regard his inward grief seemed passionately to require a more solitary habitation. To be short, Sir, within a day or two, I again encountred him in the City, clothed in the habit of one of Apollo's Priests, which profession, as he said, he had newly undertaken, as well to ease the disturbances of his own minde, as partly the better in the future to secure his state and condition, that every hour else might be subject to many variable and dangerous disturbances; so that earnestly wishing me not onely to signifie all these passages to your Highness, but humbly to assure you withall, that he entertained no other thoughts in his breast, then what should ever demonstrate an entire Loyalty and affection to your service. O Hercules , cried out Arethusius , what prodigies of resolution are these? that she who was my onely guide and conductor in my greatest dangers and necessities, should now lose her self with those accidents in a Religion, which scarce any of her kindred or Counttey, would fancy and acknowledge to the world, besides a person, (whose youth and courage meriting the highest advancement in earthly honours) should thus cast off his preferment, when his years and vertues invited him to action? But as the Gods irrevocable Decrees are inscrutable to all humane judgements, so since there is no fetching back this worthy couple, (as I conceive by your relation) let me know further what new Omens in your journey, have succeeded to these you have already told: Which being said, Creses began again in this manner. Sir, said he, not to trouble you with too many impertinencies, or to render those I have already related over burthensome to your sacred ears, when I found my self thus destituted of my companion, and the messenger we sent to Argos , being returned without the intelligence of the place of your abode, onely he said you parted from thence in a Grecian ship; I resolved with what possible conveniency I could to quit the Countrey and Territories of Greece , since I doubt not, but that although (as I heard) you had imbarked your self in a Vessel of that Nation, yet some accident might have altered your former determinations, which had transported your person, to other parts, either in the lesser Asia , or other where for your better advantage: With these resolutions after I had something altered and changed my habit and countenance, not to be known and discovered in those places where I intended to pass, I quickly hired for my sea travel a small Bark belonging to the Island of Chios , from whence, as I had more minde to a journey by Land then by Water, so was I perswaded in mine own fancy to take the Kingdom of Lydia in my way towards Syria , where I know the Queen your Mother attended my return with some impatiency: Not many dayes from my arrival and landing in Chios , I imbarked in another ship that brought me to Smyrna , where I remained until I could furnish my self with horses, and some commodities for my further voyage: There I must tell your Highness during my stay, I was informed of these particulars: Notwithstanding Hercrombrotus the Lydian General had seized upon all the Dominions and Jurisdiction formerly belonging, not onely to your Fathers Right, but actually under his Royal Command, yet thereby he had contracted so much envy to his person, that many factions began daily to rise against his Government, (however the horrid actions of the late Assembly and Senate of Sardis remained yet fresh in the memory and thoughts of most people) wherefore he was constrained for his greater safety with better obedience to his authority, not onely to constitute a new guard to secure his quiet, but had also appointed certain Commanders in every Province, to look strictly to the demeanours of all sorts of conditions, where amongst the rest, those of the Nobility and Gentry (who were in any kinde suspected to favour the Kingly Interest) had their liberties restrained, if not their goods in part taken from them, as was pretended onely to keep their mindes and abilities less subject, to contrive those plots that might occasion new disturbances in the Lydian Commonwealth, to the endangering of the whole Government: But as I shall not need to dilate much upon this subject, since it hath been ever held a principal Maxime of policy, that what hath received its beginning from violence and oppression, must be secured and continued by the like means, to keep those under who have most reason to complain, lest desperation make them attempt, when any opportunity is offered; so must I of the other side make you acquainted, not onely with a late peace made between the Syrians and the Lydian Dominions, but of an entire breach contracted against the King of Egypt , to the wonder of most Nations, for that the Egyptians were noted by all Asia to be the first people, that acknowledged and corresponded with the alteration of the Jurisdiction, from your noble house and family to the Senates power, having had ever since their Ambassadours in Lydia , to confirm more strongly an unity between both Governments, as an essential and necessary decorum, (as they believe to maintain in a better posture their affairs concerning the great contentions, that daily arise by reason of the wars that Orontes makes against all the Egyptian Countreys and Territories, as well in Asia , as in Africa ) wherefore as I have something briefly made known unto you, this breach that hath so lately happened, so will I if you please (in as short a manner as I can) declare not onely the causes of it according to my judgement and apprehension, but the very transactions that have passed since upon the occasion. 'Tis most certain, Sir, that for some years past, both the Kingdoms of Syria and Egypt , have attempted for each of their advantages, to unite with any powerfull State they could, whereby to become the stronger fortified in their own affairs, one against the other: To which purpose, as the Syrians found the Egyptians had endeavoured by their first address to the Lydian Senate, to gain a possession in the hearts and opinion of the people, the better to continue a flourishing Trade between them, (if not an absolute defensive and offensive League) so did the Court and Councell at Damascus not long after send a witty and able Ambassadour, as well to cross all the designs of the enemy, as to remonstrance to their considerations, how much more beneficial their correspondency, would be to the Commonwealth of Lydia , then that of their adversary, since the Egyptian neighbourhood was neither to be feared or loved, in regard of the distance of the one, and the former enmity of the other; whereas the State and Kingdom of Syria , had scarce ever warred in latter times with the Lydian Nation; or was so contrary and averse to the people in their ordinary practice, concerning the Worship of the Gods, seeing they allowed the exercise of their own Religion in all their Dominions, when as in Egypt and other Territories belonging to that King, the same indulgency was denied to all manner of conditions: Besides, the Island of Cyprus , having lately not onely ended all their contentions at sea with the Lydian Subjects, but also contracted with them such a new amity and friendship that rendred most Countreys afraid of their joynt greatness upon the Mediterranean waters, it was thought more then convenient for the Ambassador to press what agreement he could with Hercrombrotus , whereby to keep them at distance, that they might not strike in as a third interest between those two Commonwealths, which as they thought would absolutely destroy all their designs, concerning those Conquests they intended against the King of Egypts Dominions, as well in Africa as Asia: Long I must say, nevertheless these endeavours continued before they arrived at any maturity; for that Hercrombrotus esteemed it a better piece of policy to keep both these weighty Nations in a hopeful suspence, concerning the obtaining of the Lydian friendship, (since he supposed they never would accord between themselves, whilst they remained any way capable of resistance) then to render the one or the other absolutely desperate, by his taking part with the contrary Faction, until at last the Kingdom of Syria prevailing exceedingly against the Egyptian State in many advantages, which they daily obtained in the Countreys of Pamphilia , and other places; and withal Lydia it self not being able to supply the greedy appetites of the Souldiers, in regard our Nation wanted the Golden Mines of other Princes, which could not be so well supplied, as from some Territories under the Dominions of the King of Egypt , the whole body of his Commanders, with the rest of the Councel, that then governed the affairs in the great City of Sardis , not onely shuffled up a speedy peace, (both of the defensive and offensive nature) with the cunning Ambassadour of the Syrian Kingdom, but presently dispatched a Fleet of Lydian ships (by his perswasion) through the Channel of the Mid-land Sea, toward the fortunate Islands, abounding in all manner of riches belonging to that great Monarch, whereby to possess themselves if it be possible of those places so much famed over all the world, not onely for Mines, but other rareties and excellencies of the world: but however the success thereof be not yet known to what a perfection it will arrive unto, by reason of the difficultness of the journey, and the many chances and hazzards that belong to such a voyage, neverthelesse this attempt hath absolutely destroyed all hope of any future agreement, between the King of Egypt , and the Lydian people; which perhaps in time with the powerfull assistance of the immortall Gods, may produce sudden effects for your advantage; in regaining those Crowns that so rightfully belong to your Family and Inheritance. Stay here a little Creses , said the Prince, since you seem to prognosticate by your discourse, as if the amendment of my fortunes, depended much upon these late transactions in the Kingdom of Lydia , whereas I conceive by the new peace you have mentioned, my hopes concerning any assistance from the State of Syria , appears altogether void and frustrate to that effect; and for the Egyptian power, as I apprehend it, exceedingly lessened and diminished in these latter times, by reason of their multiplicity of wars and contentions, so hath it ever since been esteemed at too great a distance to work any considerable matter, belonging either to the good or hurt of the Lydian Nation; wherefore consequently cannot possibly afford me or my friends much benefit. 'Tis true, replied Creses , some outward appearances are in these objections; but when it may be considered withall, that the Syrian endeavour was onely colourably to work the Lydians from the Egyptian Interest, whilst themselves become thereby more easily masters of their own designs, and that by this unrepairable breach, the King of Egypt is likely to be made your entire friend (at leastwise against your mortal enemies, that else of the contrary might have united with that power to your disadvantage, notwithstanding what agreement soever, could have been made between the two Crowns of Syria and Egypt ) I suppose your Highness may be wholly converted in your opinions, so far as to think that this accord was but onely a State-policy contrived as well for your benefit, as the Syrian ends; since you cannot doubt, but as Orontes affections by reason of your blood, must needs continue real towards your particular, so it is a great deal more advantageable for any Monarch, to see another righted against the Rebellions of his own people, then to have his Subjects prevail in any contention powerfully against his hereditary Titles and Prerogative, since many examples of that nature, might shake the foundation of any Government in time; besides, the Syrian Kingdom, wanting neither greatness or ambition, cannot chuse but be as sensible of such dangerous Presidents, as any other Dominion within the worlds circumference. Here their discourse became suddenly interrupted, by the unexpected appearance of the Princess Cloria , who belike having finished her ordinary Sacrifices and Devotions, was willing a little to ease the grief of her minde, by some contented Recreations, within the limits of those Woods, and so by accident had found out her Brother, and Creses , as they were discoursing together of the Lydian passages. 'Tis true, Prince Arethusius upon the arrival of his sister, quickly rose from his shady seat, with something a smiling countenance, whereby to give her the more chearful entertainment, since he knew her continual sorrow required rather occasions of pacification to sweeten her settled apprehensions, then new disturbances, whereby again to make her minde disquieted: Wherefore, however he intended not to conceal from her knowledge, any of his own affairs or intention, yet he was resolved to relate them unto her, in the best sense he could devise for her better satisfaction: To which purpose after he had merrily told her, that notwithstanding she had in her own particular, been serving the Gods formally in the Temple, yet he assured her, that both himself and Creses in the interim, were also religiously not onely disposed, but employed; since they had been reading and understanding the Predictions of the great God Apollo of Delphos , which concerned as well the future fate of Cyprus as Lydia. Cloria having now put her chief comfort in the fortunes of her little Son young Narcissus , in that his gallant Father could not again be recalled by any of her sorrowful endeavours, with a kinde of an earnest, though sad countenance, desired her Brother if he pleased to make her acquainted with those Prophesies, which as she said, she hoped at leastwise would instruct her actions, how to prosecute her course hereafter, either for her sons benefit, or the Gods service, and in the interim to bear her crosses with convenient patience, according to the will and pleasure of the immortal Gods: With these words, she distilled also from her fair eyes a few tears, yet in such a manner, as if she retained in her minde some inward intention, not to publish to the world more then she must needs, the occasions of her excessive grief. Prince Arethusius endeavouring all he could, from time to time to take away his sisters discontents, from the strength of her imagination, was glad that at present she had of her own accord, proposed some divertisement to her thoughts: Wherefore after he had made a short repetition of all those passages, both of Joyela and the Scythian Queen, according as they had been related unto him by Creses ; for her further satisfaction he also wished him, to deliver into her hands the written Prophesies, which he had brought out of Greece from the Oracle of Apollo . The sweet though sad Princess, went over the papers often with her beautifull eyes, sometimes also would she gently move her lips, with a kinde of a stedfast earnestness, when she came to those lines, that concerned the Island of Cyprus , and her sons future fortunes: In all which postures, however her Brother attentively observed her motions, yet he was resolved not to interrupt her employment, expecting at the latter end, to have sufficient discourses with her upon the subject, not onely in what belonged to her own and her sons particular, but also in those things that appertained to his affairs: When Cloria had made an end of reading those Prophetical Verses, with a certain lovely smile made up between her sadness, and the excellency of her countenance, she desired Creses , to explain to her better understanding, as well the validity, as the meaning of these written Predictions; since, as she said, their authority, as well as their interpretation, might require some more then ordinary confirmation, to give her variable thoughts satisfaction in both the particulars. Most excellent Lady, said Creses , as the Gods cannot be false in uttering any thing of future events to the world for humane information, so have I truly delivered into your Brothers possession, as I received them from those very Priests, that then attended the Temple of Delphos , onely for those purposes; insomuch, as if they should any way fail of their duty, by performing untruly their Offices in that nature, towards the expecting people, that make their journeys into Greece to be confirmed in their doubts and Devotions, they might fear to be punished, either by divine or secular chastisements; which labour and trust being enjoyned me by the Queen your most noble and vertuous Mother, I have made bold first to open the secret to you, and your Brother; as not fearing but that the consequence exceedingly concerns, both the King of Lydia , and the Island of Cyprus : Well Creses , replied the Princess, though I shall be entirely unwilling to suspect the integrity of you, or those Priests you have mentioned, since I must neither deem you a falsity, or them sacrilegious persons, yet may I doubt very much, whether they proceed absolutely from the Gods power or revelations, for that oftentimes many delusions and misinterpretations follow the best actions and enquiries of this nature, to the dissatisfaction of those, which are over curious and superstitious in these particulars. Truly Madam, replied Creses , all that I can say to confirm your belief touching these Predictions is, that as the first part of the Prophesie related, having already happened right concerning the unhappy disasters of your most glorious father, in his being unworthily betrayed by the Myssian Nation, so probably it may be supposed, that the rest which is behinde of better fates to your self and Brother, wherein I presume all the Royal Family will be included, must also by the same Rules of Conjecture and Reason, follow both in order and certainty: Farther they would have disputed about this intricate business (however Cloria , as well as her Brother, had already received in their apprehensions some satisfaction) but that the time afforded them no conveniency, since Phebus began to be over violent in prosecuting his journey towards the middle period, (though the shady Groves of the place contributed to their persons a certain gentle and convenient defence) and the hour called them away, according to their wonted custom, both to dinner and repose; insomuch as presently without any more argument, they walked softly towards the Lodge, not at any great distance from the side of that most beautiful and goodly River: However it was concluded in their retirement, that as Creses had made them acquainted with the particulars of his employment into Greece , so in regard he had been commanded to that journey meerly by the Queens direction, who could not therefore but earnestly wait his return for her better satisfaction, he should with all expedition hasten his further voyage into Syria , to the City of Damascus , where Hiacinthia kept her Court; as well to give her an accompt of his service and Embassie, as more unexpectedly to let her know the joyful news both of her Childrens safety, and their abode. After that Creses was parted from the pleasant Valley of Daphene , however had not made many dayes journey towards the great Kingdom of Syria , when an unnatural Treason was discovered in those obscure though delightful Groves, closely harboured against Arethusius's person and family, which accidentally became revealed after this manner. There was a young man called Dolan , newly entertained to wait upon the King in his chamber, who belike having contracted some despair in his minde, concerning his Masters fortunes, or perhaps over ambitious to be maintained in his pride and luxuries at any rate, from the then as he conceived rich and powerful State of Lydia , kept in a continual correspondency with the Commanders of that State, and the rest of the Councel, insomuch as no secrets he could learn, either of the Princes intentions, or his sister Cloria's affections, but presently he conveighed the knowledge thereof to the wealthy City of Sardis: It fortuned also that one Diophates , being employed by Arethusius into the Countrey and Territories of Lydia , during his abode within those solitary Woods, as well to inform himself of all the passages belonging to the new Government of Hercrombrotus , as also to nourish such discontents as he should finde stirring, by reason of the many factions then reigning in the Kingdom, as had been signified by Creses , which Dolan not onely discovered to the State of Lydia , but also gave a speedy information of the Messenger sent with the particulars of his commission; so that by this means Diophates being at last taken in his close walks, was instantly brought before the Councel, then sitting at Sardis , to be examined, where however with a great deal of confidence and courage he denied his charge and accusations, because he would not afford any causes of suspition concerning his Masters other designs, (which he hoped notwithstanding his own surprize, might prosper towards his benefit and advantage) yet being at length convinced by such pregnant testimonies, as could no further be denied or withstood, in regard he perceived the information had come from some Treason in the Princes own Family, he was forced to yield himself and cause to the pleasure of his exasperated enemies, who instantly with some few circumstances commanded him to execution; yet not being conducted with so strict and watchful a guard to his death, he found out an opportunity by letter, not onely to signifie all these passages to Arethusius , and his Sister, but also to advertise them, that the young man Dolan , as he remembred, was concealed in the Princes Chamber, upon their finall conference to this purpose, when himself was to take his journey into the Lydian Territories; wherefore supposed none probably could be the Traytour of his Masters secrets, but that very person mentioned and seen, since those privacies were discovered, which no person else could possibly do. Scarce can it be expressed with what an exasperated rage, Prince Arethusius entertained the first intelligence of this unhappy news, wherein he understood he had not onely lost the life of a most faithful and courageous Officer, meerly in executing of his commands, but had within the limits of his own Family also a Trayterous Servant, who had from time to time discovered his greatest secrets to his Enemies. O you Gods, said he, What can become of our future fortunes, when my chiefest friends are destroyed by the practices of those nearest about my person? O humane ingratitude, and falshood, said he, to what a pitch of wickedness are you now arrived unto amongst the Lydian people? When as neither the consideration of the Gods Worship, nor any mortal obligation, are of any force to hinder miserable man, from perpetrating such disloyalties, as are not in what kinde soever to be exampled in former ages: But whilst Arethusius was in this manner bemoaning his own misfortunes in the general, and as generally complaining against those few servants of the Lydian Nation, which he had entertained more for necessity then ostentation, since his comming into the Countrey of Daphene ; in that he could not promise to his uncertain condition those supplies, that would contribute much to their advantage, his sister the Princess Cloria standing by, during the time her brother uttered many of his passionate discourses, after a while told told him, with a certain kinde of countenance, that seemed to put on both fear and seriousness, that as the expression of his own private passions, did but serve to vent his own spleen without fruit, so was it more necessary to send presently and apprehend the Traytour, whose sudden escape else might, as she said, not onely prevent his personal punishment, to the encouragement of other people, joyned perhaps woth him in the same league of combination, but also would hinder the knowledge of many secrets not yet divulged, or made apparent by any confession, This counsel was no sooner given by the discreet Princess, but instantly a small guard was employed to secure Dolan , who belike had so encreased his confidence by his wickedness, that they found him quietly sleeping, with almost an unparallel'd rest under those shades, where the King his Master was accustomed most to content himself with sports and delights, as if he rather built his thoughts upon some power extraordinary, that could keep him from all punishment, notwithstanding any discovery of his treasons, then doubted, that either the Gods or men would detect or chastise him for his enormous crimes: After that Dolan was in this manner contrary to his expectation apprehended, he was quickly brought before certain Commissioners to be examined, where having a long space justified his innocency, with many perjuries, and other asseverations of a strange nature, notwithstanding invincible arguments were alledged, both for his conviction and condemnation, at last there were produced some papers under his own hand-writing concerning his practices, which had been found upon search in his private Cabinet. As these pregnant and more then palpable proofs might have been sufficient, not onely to give judgement, but to convert the prisoner to the consideration of some goodness and repentance; so was it thought of the other side convenient, according to the Laws and Customs of other Nations, to have Dolan put to the torture, as well to render him absolutely convicted by his own Confession, as by that means more directly to extort from him divers practices of the same nature perhaps yet concealed, that might threaten a further destruction to the affairs of both the Princes: But Dolan however his obstinacy had appeared sufficiently, as well in his actions as in his denial, yet when he saw before his eyes ready prepared thos torments ordained for his punishment, his apprehension then began to fail towards his advantage, insomuch as presently he confessed himself, not onely guilty of those crimes of disloyalty and treason that had been laid to his charge, but also declared particularly how he had been bribed by a certain continued pension, from some Ministers of State in the Kingdom of Lydia , to reveal all the secrets he could possibly come to know belonging to the Prince his Master: This being enough for his condemnation, Arethusius sent presently to a neighbouring Duke his friend, to desire the execution of the Traytor, might be performed within his Territories, since the Law of Nations (he being not in possession of any of his own Dominions) gave him no sufficient authority to put into practice Justices of this nature, though against his own proper servants and followers. As this request was soon entertained in the breast of that Noble Prince, so was Dolan instantly, with a competent guard of Souldiers conducted to a certain Plain, where being bound to a stake, he was shot to death by many Darts and Arrows, where afterwards his Members hung upon a Gibbet prepared for that purpose, to be a spectacle to all passengers, until the fowls of the air, had intombed his whole carcase within their hungry and devouring intrails. But notwithstanding, Prince Arethusius had thus happily freed himself from the future danger of this pernicious enemy (that neither could be won to a competent fidelity in his Masters behalf, by those benefits he had received from his bounty, or had the least consideration or fear of the Gods judgements in his own particular) yet being alone one day with his Sister Cloria in her Chamber, he began to renew his former complaints of his disasters and misfortunes after this manner: Is it possible most dear Cloria , said he, that my spiteful and cruel fates, should thus still persecute me in all Countries and Regions without any relaxation? cannot the calms and private retirements of the Daphenine Groves, afford so much secure content to the thoughts of a banished Prince, as to suffer him to rest free from the dangers and treasons of his own private Family and Servants? Who should be esteemed willing companions to him in all his unfortunate injuries, with other losses both of Countrey and Friends? what seas, dangers, and battles have I passed, said he, to finde out again (O sweet Sister) your so much wished for and desired conversation, thinking to enjoy it in some measure, whilst in the interim each of us should be hazzarded by the machinations and treasons of our own people, that we supposed had rather fled to us for protection and subsistence, then for any deceits or pernicious ends whatsoever? O Lydia Lydia , said he, the Nation of the Lydians , once the very flower of glory and gallantry, is now not onely become base and most unworthy in her productions, but the sole centre of all falsehood, corruption, and atheism, betraying their Princes for a little gain, and gaining ignominy for their reward: These I may say, lost my Noble Father to enjoy their own luxuries, and afterwards sold his Crown and Prosperity, to conserve the purchase, that at last notwithstanding made them slaves to their enemies, and now also they would betray me to the same dishonour. The Lydian Court I must confess, said he, first nourished these Vipers, that lived to nothing but their own pride, and conversed no where but by deceit: who cheated the King in his affairs, and would undermine me in my purposes. Much more of these passionate expressions, Prince Arethusius uttered in the presence of his dear Sister, and would farther have proceeded in discourses of this nature, but that Cloria her self told him, it was to no purpose thus to beat the air with remembrances of past accidents; but rather to consider of wayes how to prevent future mischiefs, since by experience they found the Lydian Nation inconstant and false to their designs, and their corruptions and luxuries not to be prevented either by Gratitude or Religion: Here Arethusius could not chuse but smile a little, to see how his Sister gravely urged a necessity of temper in his actions and expressions, and yet in all the long journey they had made together, his chief endeavours had been to perswade some relaxations concerning her own violent passions, for the loss of her dear Husband Narcissus , though no more to be remedied them were those past accidents, that had rendred (as he thought) both the Kingdom of Lydia and himself miserable: however they resolved, not onely more narrowly hereafter to look to the particular actions of their own Family, but also in time to be rid of most of the Lydian and Myssian people about their persons; yet in the interim that their solicitations were continually busied with an intention to put these designs in execution, Meliander the Myssian Commander (who had been taken prisoner in the last Battle by Hercrombrotus Forces) suddenly arrived at their small Court; where having saluted Arethusius and his fair Sister, he was induced to make a relation of his own adventures, since the time of that unfortunate accident, which he performed in this sort, both of them being present. Most vertuous Princes, and the more vertuous and great, said he, that no mishaps seem powerfully to work against the invincibleness of your courages and goodness, (humane oppositions being onely motives to dishearten those of the inferiour rank and quality, and not such as participate with the Gods in a kinde of elevation of the minde, proceeding from the clearness of your extraction and education) as it was my misfortune, to be made subject to your enemies for a while, and so by consequence kept a prisoner in the strong Castle of Sardis , amongst others of the same State, at last it was my luck (I will not call it a happiness) in this manner to be delivered: Being thus as I said captivated, and knowing by such a posture I could neither prove serviceable to your affairs, or pleasing to my own thoughts, after some consideration I resolved, to break through my present confinement, or else to hazzard that loathed life, which I esteemed not at all worthy, but to be imployed in a more active freedom for my Countries benefit: Amongst many projects that my working fancy brought forth, in the end I found a means to let my self down into the Castle ditch, by a continued tie of such materials, as were in my Chamber, having the opportunity (in regard the closeness of my imprisonment, scarce admitted any person in three dayes time to visit the place where I was, onely such provision as was allowed for my simple and slender diet, became conveyed to my possession by a cord from a lower room, through a little hole opened at that instant underneath) by putting back a great and strong bar of iron for the purpose: 'Tis true it might be thought some omission in my Keepers concerning my security, that any means for my escape was suffered from above; but the stupendious height of the Tower where I remained, and the supposed want of all conveniency for such an exploit, I presume gave them a sufficient confidence: For in truth, if I had not in my descent met with an unexpected support that hindered me from falling, I had in the midst of the way undoubtedly ventured upon such a leap, as must of necessity have more then hazzarded my life: but being there by accident placed, I had both the fortune and the opportunity, in winding a little about the Tower to finde out a concealed passage, that conveyed me by Moon shine over the tops of certain other buildings, until by degrees I entirely got to the bottom of the ditch, where notwithstanding I continued in some perplexity all the next night following, how to get safe out of the furthermost gate, alwayes kept as I knew securely guarded by several Officers and Souldiers, that used to be most inquisitive after any passengers of what nature soever they were: When I was in this obscure trench, I made my perambulation about it for some hours, as not knowing else what to do with my self, until at last viewing and observing every private nook of the wall, by chance it was my fortune to finde certain Arms, which either a Souldier had lost or hid in that place: As my apprehension upon the first sight of them, imagined that one use or other might be made thereof, I took them up presently in my hand, and after a while considering that such a disguise would be most proper to convey me out of the Fort undiscovered, I instantly turning the wrong side of my habit outward, adorned my person with those Trophies, intending upon the next opportunity to put in practice some further project for my security, which continued my expectation until the following night, might be a coverture to my design, though I knew not well to what effect my desire would tend, since scarce appearances of safety and escape were visible to my judgement and reason: But as if the Gods had a minde to flatter me in these hopes, when I least looked for any relief (for that having no provision I could not long stay in those quarters) of a sudden there appeared at some distance from me (it being now dark night) a certain kinde of dim light still approaching nearer and nearer to me: the desperateness of my condition rendred me more confident, and that confidence (when I perceived it was a company of fresh Souldiers that were appointed at one of the gates to relieve the watch) presently made me without any fear to strike into the Troop, and in that manner boldly marched with the rest to their appointed station; where being arrived, and neither noted nor observed by any, it was no difficult matter from thence to take my flight to what other part of the Town I pleased, which secured me for a few dayes after in the great City of Sardis , amongst multitudes of people; however I heard in the interim much enquiry was made in divers places about my escape, insomuch as I had no desire long to remain in that dangerous region, when as in a manner my own shadow sometimes was terrible to my frighted imagination; so that to be short in my relation to your Highnesses, as soon as I found the first conveniency for my departure without suspicion, I took my journey towards mine own Countrey of Myssia , where I hoped, although I could not prevail powerfully against those Forces, which the General had left there to subdue the people, yet at leastwise I should probably obscure my own person under the shelter of some of my friends and kindred, until I could better provide for my safety and transportation to some other Kingdom or Principality in the lesser Asia ; for I knew it was impossible to undertake any voyage by Sea, without eminent hazzard of being discovered, in that all the Ports were most strictly guarded through the whole Territories belonging to the Lydian Government: Upon my arrival in Myssia I must tell you, that I found the people more inclinable to rise then I expected, and most of all in those parts belonging to Argylius jurisdiction, by reason of the discontents which his eldest Son had contracted, against the too much prosperity of the Lydian Nation within his Fathers Dominions; though I must confess, the old fox himself kept still such a decorum between his necessary obedience to the present power, and his inward sorrow to see both his fortunes, and his party so much deceived, as notwithstanding he was known oftentimes to complain of his unhappiness, and much more of his disloyalty, in deserting at the first the King your Fathers service, whereby onely to maintain his own covetousness and ambition, yet durst he never seem outwardly, either to repine at Hercrombrotus conquests, or so much as once disobey any of his Officers orders; however oftentimes they were exacted of him and his people, with many jears and large affronts, which no courage else in the world could have suffered, without some apparent revenge shewed upon himself or his enemies: But what the Fathers poorness of spirit seemed to fear and decline, the Sons youth and exasperation appeared to entertain; insomuch as presently raising some Forces within those hilly Territories, and conceiving me by reason of that experience, I had gained in the Wars abroad in forreign parts, to be most fit to command the Troops, with the consent of all the rest of the same interest, I was created forthwith Commander of the Army. 'Tis true, the Gods seemed for some time to play with our appearing prosperity, not onely by gaining many victories in several places of the Countrey, but also in bringing to our aid most of all the common people, who in general are carried on to be active and assisting, rather by the successes they apprehend, then by either the probability or the justness of that cause they are desired to maintain: In this manner I must say, we continued for some moneths confidently resisting, if not fighting with success against our enemies; however still for the better safety of our new raised Souldiers (not being so well practised in Warlike Discipline) we were content for the most part, to make use of Bogs and Mountains for our defence and retirements, until they became wearied both in their pursuit and expectation, and so returned again into their own quarters: But whether Hercrombrotus (who possesses now the chief place in authority, by that Councel that is established for his assistance concerning the Lydian Government) finding these slow transactions of his Souldiers did serve for no other effects, but to consume his treasure and waste his Army, not onely presently sent more Forces into Myssia , but dealt underhand with cowardly or covetous Argylius , to take off his Son from prosecuting his former purposes, by proposing to his consideration many profitable and advantageable conditions, both for himself and his posterity; withal intimating, that as these continued contentions would at last totally destroy and desolate the whole Countrey, so was it unpossible without money and other assistance, for the Kingdom of Myssia alwayes to defend its particular against the growing supplies, that would be dispatched daily from the care and industry of the Lydian Governours; insomuch as it was better for him to yield in time, when mercy and honourable terms might be procured, then to hazzard by protraction, the absolute ruine of his friends and whole Family for ever: Certain it was, that the young man long contended with his Fathers intimations, knowing him to be in his thoughts a person, that onely looked at his particular preservation and commodity, above either the Gods service or his Countries good: Besides the Priests who were made believe, they should still continue their jurisdiction over the peoples actions, were also induced to a complyance to that purpose, in whose rhetorick and perswasions Argylius alwayes relyed, as upon some holy and infallible Oracle: So that after a kinde of long contestation in this nature, the Son of Argylius being either inconstant in his disposition, or over-powered by continual solicitations, was at last won to a Treaty with the Lydian Forces, which I perceiving, and withal understanding that many other great Lords of our party, intended to follow the same rule and example, for their better quiet and more probable assurance, as they supposed, I resolved presently either to quit the Countrey to the enemy, or give some end to our proceeding by a desperate and final charge: Nevertheless finding that the Souldiers under my command, upon the very report of this intended agreement, that flew with too speedy wings over all those Territories, that seemed to yield a certain kinde of obedience to our intimations before, began already in their hearts to decline all further contentions, as it were carried on with hopes of a more commodious settlement; and at that very instant hearing also, that the new King of Scythia , with whom I had formerly both acquaintance and favour, was lately come with a great power into some part of the Armenian jurisdiction, I considered it to be my best way, rather then expose the poor people under my Government, to an assured slaughter, without much probability of prevailing to any purpose, as peaceably as I could to leave the Countrey to the enemies dispose, until I could again by some forreign Forces procured from that Prince, an increase as well of my Army as an interest for the Myssians advantage. In conclusion, having taken these resolutions, as I soon quitted the bounds of my native Countrey, not a little I must confess encouraged by these hopes, so travelling through Pontus and other Principalities of the lesser Armenia , towards the higher part of the greater, where the King of Scythia then remained, in the way hearing of your abode in the delightful Vallies of Daphene , I could not but think it my duty first, not onely to repair hither, to know your pleasure, but to make these sad relations of my adventures. No sooner had Meliander made an end of this discourse, but Prince Arethusius by his looks, seemed as if again he intended to return to his old way of complaining against his fates: yet presently casting his eyes upon his Sister, as if that lovely countenance had been a charming spell to overthrow all disasters, that could in any kinde touch his fortunes or humane condition, he saluted her with a smile, which not long after was followed with these expressions. When the Gods, said he, have sufficiently taken their pleasure, in tormenting my particular, by a continuation of disgraces and infidelities, proceeding from other people, I hope they may have at the last some compassion of Euarchus's Family, whose vertues I am confident merited their best consideration: In the interim I shall endeavour, as well to please them with my actions as to satisfie the world, both in my courage and industry, until I either compass my rights by victories over my enemies, or sacrifice my life to the last period that honour can claim of a Prince: Then turning again to Meliander , he used to him this language. Well Meliander , said he, I see now all is entirely in the possession of fortunate Hercrombrotus , as well in Myssia , as in the Kingdom of Lydia , the unlucky and disloyal Senate being, as I hear, absolutely dissolved by the prevailing power of the Souldiers in the Army, in whose place, as it should seem, they intend their gallant General shall succeed to be King in my stead, of all those large Dominions which Euarchus Heir and Hyacinthia's Son by hir birth, should have enjoyed. Truly Sir, replyed Meliander , as yet the destinies appear to favour his cause: but as he hath by a most remarkable act of requital put down that power, which first took upon it so strange an authority over their King and Nobility, against the fundamental constitutions of the Nation, so is it more for your advantage, that one govern by the favour of the Sword, (he being in appearance the more noble enemy) then that the multitude should have still reigned, who never yet knew what belonged to justice or pitty, as all their actions can testifie, from the very beginning to the last end of their Government: Besides this manner of rule carries yet with it the face of the old Monarchy, whereas the Senates usurpation was nothing else, but a most cruel Monster of many heads, that distasted all the world, onely to continue their own pride and covetousness, in the highest measure could be thought upon by mortal people. Many such discourses as these past between Arethusius, Cloria , and Meliander , until at last they concluded, that according to Melianders first resolution of visiting Dogalphus the new King of Scythia , he should shortly take his journey to that purpose; however further to be accompanied with these instructions, that as Prince Arethusius by misfortunes, had been forcibly driven out of his own Countreys and Dominions, by the power and malice of his unreconcilable enemies and subjects; so was he confident to be relieved, not onely by the victories, but the goodness of such a King, that Asia already began to look upon with some eyes of admiration. After the departure of Meliander , both Arethusius and his Sister, thought it something convenient for their better recreation, to visit many Towns standing upon the Borders of the great River Euphrates , in which passage their Barges being drawn up the stream by the force of horses, they had the conveniency, not onely to see the Countrey with the best advantage, but also in their way to receive such entertainments from other Princes, that made them confident, when the first occasion presented it self, they should each of them be assisted in a high measure, in all their affairs and contentions, against those that opposed their fortunes and prosperities. But whilst they were thus welcomed by all sorts of conditions, with a certain kinde of unparallel'd magnificency and respect; some honouring their persons in regard of their birth and qualities; others again seemed more to look upon their vertues and beauty, joyned with such an innocent and flourishing youth, as appeared not to have as yet sufficient time to contemplate the malice of the world, and therefore the rather to be pittied for their oppressions and misfortunes, news was brought them by an express messenger from their Court, remaining behinde in the Daphenine Groves, that young Ascanius Brother to them both, was newly arrived from the great City of Damascus in Syria , being sent equally from Orontes and Andromida , to give them a salutation in that private place of retirement, which they had made choice of for their own present satisfaction. As Cloria and Arethusius were extreamly joyful by this unexpected occasion, to have the sweet conversation of their most dear Brother Prince Ascanius ; so on the otherside, could they not chuse but exceedingly to wonder, that the State and Councel of Syria , should now think it fit to use any complements towards their particular, when as it was apparent, that at the present, Mazarius was violently contracting a friendship with Hercrombrotus in Lydia: But however these transactions might sufficiently have busied their thoughts for a long season, yet the haste they made to give their young Brother the meeting, would not suffer them much to dwell upon the consideration: Insomuch as instantly commanding their Barges to be prepared, they again made haste down the River of Euphrates , towards the Valley of Daphene , where he was advised to stay until their return. The affectionate congratulations that past between this noble company at their first meeting, may very well be imagined by the nearness of their blood and interest, after so long a time of separation: wherein however their hearts spoke more then their lips, and their eyes then their tongues, since the greatest passions are best entertained in contemplation, when as words for the most part confuse the object to a less degree of perfection; nevertheless I must say, when they had as it were plentifully surfeited upon their content, retiring for more convenient repose into the Princess Cloria's Chamber, curiosity also coming in play to be satisfied, especially when valuable consequences depended thereupon, Arethusius desired his Brother to let him know, how it came to pass, that when the Councel of Syria by the directions of Mazarius , as it was generally reported, had made such an accord with Hercrombrotus , that all the Royal Family of Euarchus were to be banished from the Court of Damascus , of a sudden both himself and his Sister, should be saluted with new favours from Orontes and his Mother? especially when they esteemed their condition to be absolutely forsaken by that agreement, according to Rules of State-Policy, that they could not as yet very well comprehend: unto which Ascanius quickly replied in this manner. Brother said he, as it is most certain, that the spitefulness of our destinies, contrived such an accord to your disadvantage, and Syria's dishonour, since no time will be lasting enough, to blot out the memory of the Record, so was there more then common Ceremonies used to make me, not onely acquainted with the reality of the thing, but to perswade me to a willing compliance in my own particular; insomuch as divers instruments belonging to the great Favourite Mazarius , used many endeavours to intangle my youth, in a kinde of insensibility of what was purposed against the good of our whole Family, who were as they knew now chiefly to subsist by the countenance and respects of other Princes; and Orontes being the most eminent in the Asian world, what State of a lesser quality would venture themselves any more to engage in our quarrel? so far as to oppose the proceedings of fortunate Hercrombrotus , that had not onely from a private person seized upon all the Territories belonging to the Lydian Government, but also won the Syrian King, to become his intimate friend, in despite of that interest and blood, which appertained to Hyacinthia , Sister to his deceased Father: But as my heart was full of just indignations at these proceedings, so was I not much unwilling to depart from such a Court, that neither knew, as I then believed, how to value honour and vertue, or could be grateful for any acts I had performed in the Wars against those opposite to Orontes's greatness and prosperity. I cannot deny, but that I called divers times in my slumbers, upon Condorosus for his assistance and revenge, both in regard of his and my enemies; however I resolved notwithstanding with a quiet seeming pacification to take my leave, as well of the Queen, as the King, and in that posture ordained a feast to be made to Turinus the Syrians principal Commander, in whose friendship I did entirely confide, since under no banner else would I have so often fought for Orontes interest. 'Tis true, we spent most part of the night in those jovialities, that were accustomed more properly to belong unto the season, wherein I neither complained against the unkinde usage of the Court, or appeared to repine at all, at the manner of my departure, although I was resolved in my minde upon my quitting of the Kingdom of Syria , to enter presently into the service of the Egyptian Wars in the Countrey of Pamphylia , as well to give my self another imployment, according to the inclinations of my nature and disposition, as to be the more conveniently revenged concerning the proceedings of Mazarius : whom I supposed had been the onely contriver of my banishment, to compass a few, though dishonourable ends with Hercrombrotus , and the Lydian State; but Turinus , being as it should seem, inflamed with my abuse, or rather I may say, provoked to a resentment of the ingratitude used towards my particular, the next morning very early, and without my knowledge, or privity, entering the Kings Chamber, began to expostulate with him in this language. Sir, said he, if the deserts of my self and your brave Kinsman young Ascanius (these being his very words, as I have been informed) Son to Euarchus , once great Commander of all the Lydian Territory, and Queen Hyacinthia your own Aunt, now remaining within your Court, and Dominions, cannot prevail so far with your consideration, as to reflect upon those valiant actions he hath performed lately, for the maintenance of your Glory and Crown; yet I think it my duty, being the chief Commander of your Arms, to let you know, that I do not onely apprehend the dishonour to your person and dignity, by giving way to this unparallel'd act of injustice, against a Prince, whose worth, as well as his blood, may challenge more then an ordinary interest, within your vaste Dominions, but also fear a general revolt of your Souldiers from your service will succeed, by reason of these proceedings, since thereby, it may very well be considered, how that we fight not now, nnder your Majesties authority, for glory, and regard, but to sacrifice our lives at any rate, to compass some poor designs that best stand with the appetites of such, as neither know your honour, or others vertues: So that if you please still to continue the design of banishing Ascanius from your presence, and protection, let me in like manner follow the same fate; for that as I have been often assisted by his valour in many Battles, so can I never forget my own gratitude, and your safety, in which minde also are (as I believe) most of your other Commanders: As these were the words, that Turinus , was pleased to speak to Orontes in my behalf, so did he gather by the Kings countenance, an extraordinary inward trouble in his thoughts, in regard of what he had so boldly, and resolutely spoken; however for the instant he might perceive, that either his youth, or want of experience in matters of State, was most unwilling to determine any thing without further conference to be had with Mazarius his principal Favourite, or Andromida the Queen his Mother; yet for a reply, he told him, within a day or two he would so far consider of his advice, that some satisfaction should be given to the Souldiers in that particular. In conclusion, not to detain you over long with stories of my self, by the time appointed for answer, not onely this determination concerning my banishment was recalled, but I became also violently solicited, to make a speedy journey into these Daphenian Vallies, where the whole Court understood upon the arrival of Creses , that both you, and my Sister, for the present remained, whereby to desire each of you, to repair to the great City of Damascus , promising you should receive such entertainments, as were most agreeing with your dignities, and Orontes affections; neither was Mazarius in his own particular, backward, to bestow upon me also many exquisite complements, with these excuses and protestations, that however some Rules of State, had caused the King to give way to his Councels perswasion, yet were the thoughts of all the Syrian Nation, addicted extreamly to the service of Euarchus Family, which would be expressed, as he said, in the first occasion offered to that purpose, the Wars of Egypt having an end. I being won in some sort, I must say with these intimations, and withal commanded by the importunities of Andromida the Queen, I could do no less, then make you acquainted with the Kings desires; whose intention is prepared for your affectionate and honourable reception, within all his Territories and Dominions, notwithstanding any mistakes heretofore concerning those opinions: which is all I have to say, belonging to my own Embassie. O heavens cried out Arethusius , when Ascanius had made an end of this relation, to what a miserable condition is become the ancient, and famous Kingdom of Syria , when for the consideration of some few advantages against the Egyptian Empire, she dares neither protect vertues in others, or kindred belonging to her self, before the face of him, that cannot claim justly to be a King or a friend: No, no, Mazarius , triumph still securely in thy conquest over that unworthy people, since Arethusius presence shall give thee no jealousie at all, whilst time and fortune shall become more apparently his favourers: O most dear and honest Uncle Orestes , said he, as I cannot now but reflect upon those speeches, which last parted us at thy own Castle, so will I ever commend that constancy shewed, which hitherunto hath severed thee both from the Courts inticements, and the Favourites deceits. But however Prince Arethusius , could not be won by any perswasion or importunity, to return again to the glorious and flourishing Court of Syria , rather intending to take some imployment under the King of Egypt , in his Countreys and Dominions of Pamphylia , since that Monarch was lately become a most irreconcilable enemy to the proceedings of Hercrombrotus , as well for the friendship he had made with Mazarius , the King of Syria's Councellour; as more especially, in that he had attempted to surprize by the Lydian Fleet, his rich and fortunate Islands in the main Ocean, yet was it thought most convenient, that the fair Princess Cloria , with her Brother Ascanius , should yield to the desires of Orontes and his Mother, in regard the prosperity of her young Son Narcissus in the Island of Cyprus , seemed to depend much upon the countenance and favour of that great and powerful State, as also in respect, that some of those Territories left him by his dead, though gallant Father, were situated within the heart and bowels of the Kingdom of Syria: Besides they very well knew, there was no way so probable to compose the factions against her and her childe in her own Countrey, as to contract some particular seeming friendship with Mazarius , the fortunate and mighty Favourite of the time, since he could if he pleased, both destroy the trading of Salamine , by denying the people a commerce with those Subjects of Tyrus and Sidon , as also extreamly advantage the cause, in lending a considerable aid to her occasions, when any open War should break out between the Princes party, and the inhabitants of Cyprus , about the rights and priviledges belonging to the young Duke. The Princess Cloria notwithstanding these reasons, was extream sorry to leave her Brother Arethusius in his solitary perambulations, whose discreet Councels, had hitherunto taken off much of that grief, which appertained to the cruel loss she had received, by the death of her dear Lord Narcissus in the Island of Cyprus : Besides, she knew as his fortune, and designs were very uncertain, so was his nature and disposition something melancholly, especially when perturbated by several occasions, and not possibly to be strengthened sufficiently by the watchful industry and fidelity of friends. These considerations I say, before her journey, oftentimes caused her to shed many tears in her retirements, with a reflection also upon her own condition, now a Widow and subject to the several events of the world, that for the most part were governed more by malice and opinion, then by justice and goodness: 'Tis true, she resolved to apply her thoughts and actions to the compassing a settlement, and some future prosperity for her Son; but what would be the factions rising against her in Cyprus , or the assistances she might have in Syria , she could not tell, since private ends, as she believed, carried onely the state of things in all Countries. Another reflection she had also in her minde, that Mazarius the powerful and great Favourite of Orontes , used extraordinary expressions concerning her invitation to the City of Damascus , because his ambition might covet a marriage between her self and some of his numerous family; for that his practice in other cases of the like nature, gave her suspicion more then probable grounds, to be cautious and circumspect in her proceedings, between her honour and her necessities; in that as she could not possible be without his assistance, so again was she resolved to continue still a Princess: From these thoughts she flew again to the consideration of her Brothers affairs, imagining which way by her intended journey, she could either good his case or his person; however his own discontented courage scorned to make any means to the Favourites power, scarce to accept of offered courtesies, until he were publickly righted in his own opinion, concerning that agreement which had been made with Hercrombrotus to his disadvantage: But all these particulars, were left in her resolutions to the longed for conversation, she hoped to have shortly with her most dear and loving Mother Queen Hyacinthia , unto whom many years absence had made her an unwilling stranger, though now joyfully to be renewed by this occasion; to which purpose the sweet Cloria every day sacrificed her many supplications unto the immortal Gods, until all necessaries being prepared for the journey, and a kinde of a sad parting had between her self and Prince Arethusius , both she and Ascanius one early, however a fair morning, set forward in their several Chariots, attended by some Troops of Horse, towards the Borders of the Syrian Monarchy. The honours that were done to the Princess Cloria , in her passage through every Town, would take up too much time to relate, since the King Orontes had commanded all his officers to omit no ceremony, that either might dignifie her reception or content her thoughts; sometimes appearing before her with Military Triumphs; and otherwhiles again saluting her by eloquent Orations, which as well set forth the former friendships and correspondencies, between the Syrian State; and the people of Cyprus , as the greatness and glory of the majestick Court kept at Damascus , until by slow travel and small journeys, she at last arrived within the walls of that splendid City, that appeared to her view, rather a world for multitudes, and a heaven for beauty, then a habitation for mortal creatures; where being met by a new guard, she was conducted to Andromida's own Palace: No sooner was she descended from her Chariot, but she became advertised, that Hyacinthia the Queen her Mother, expected her in a lower room belonging to the Kings Lodgings: O you Gods, with what timerous and dutiful blushes, did the sweet Princess perform the first Decorums of her obedience, and natural affections to her most dear Mother, which many years by the misfortune of her several adventures, had separated from her presence, all the while kneeling with multiplicity of becoming tears, distilling from her fair eyes? Of the other side the Queen, as if altogether transported between her joy and her nature, had not one word to say for her welcome, onely laying both her hands upon her two shoulders, she seemed in that posture so entirely to embrace her with her arms of affection, as if she never more intended to have her seen by any other body, whilst in the interim, her countenance spoke as it were a mixture of grief and compassion; considering as well the uncertain condition of her Son Arethusius , as the lamentable death of her dear Husband Euarchus , that now began again as freshly to bleed in her wakened apprehension, as when she first received the news of that fatal and tormenting blow: But the company present, expecting rather demonstrations of welcome and Jubilees, then remembrances of those Tragedies and misfortunes, which could not be redressed by the expression of any passion, how natural and violent soever, quickly desired the Queen, to have some compassion towards her Daughters travels, who in all probability, had wearied both her thoughts and her body, in making so long a journey, to have the happiness of her blessing and conversation; conceiving it, as they said, much more convenient, to bring her into the Bed-chamber, for her better ease and repose, then to entertain her in that manner, with nothing but the worst effects of sadness and melancholly, which in a young Ladies breast, might procure too great a habit of such ills, contrary to the intentions of the glorious Court of Syria , that was prepared by the Kings command, with all divertisements to render her Daughter best pleased, and satisfied in every particular thing, that the great and famous Nation of Syria could afford: However, the Queen presently recollected her self upon these intimations, yet there being such settled troubles in her imagination, by reason of the unsettledness of her Childrens fortunes, as it were before her face appearing banished from their Royalties and Habitations, though Cloria in person was now again once more in her wished possession, that she could not chuse, notwithstanding she conducted her into her innermost lodgings, for their more privacy of communication, but shed abundance of tears all the way she went. Scarce had Hyacinthia entertained her Daughter any time, but Messengers were sent from Orontes to congratulate her safe arrival at Damascus: Queen Andromida also dispatched Officers with such salutations, as were usual between great Princesses of quality, neither was the mighty Favourite Mazarius backward, to afford her his complementing respects; whether being induced thereunto by the courtesie and affability of his own nature and breeding, or rather moved by other designs hidden for his own advantage, did prove some question to the then best understandings in State Affairs, since it was generally believed, he was no intimate friend to Hyacinthia , or any of the Royal Family of Euarchus ; as either holding them over burthensome for his other affairs, or the Kingdom of Syria , being not sufficiently capable to afford them assistance, according to their desires, and feared importunities, whose thoughts appeared altogether busied, in the contentions between the Egyptians , and his young Master the King of Syria , which unity he was supposed to hinder, in regard that upon a general peace, both Conderosus and the other discontented Princes would be included, though enemies not to be reconciled to his greatness and particular interest, for that many of them being as he knew, incompatible with his Government and favour, not onely in respect he was a stranger born, but had got such a prevailing mastery over Orontes affections, by his own industry, and Andromida's solicitation, that scarce could any person else be admitted to any Councel. But some time after all these ceremonious visits were past, Hyacinthia used these words to the Princess Cloria . Daughter, said she, by these Complements you may see the effects, of youth and beauty, joyned perhaps with some other politick respects, which as yet we do not very well understand, since of a sudden we are come from the low and contemptible condition of banished persons, to be entertained in the degree of people of quality; at leastwise in some more them ordinary estimation: As I must confess, I am not throughly acquainted with the several windings and turnings of the Syrian Court, notwithstanding my birth and continuance in the place, yet nevertheless, I hope we shall still have a principal respect towards the preservation of the surviving Family of great and good Euarchus , whose injuries were rather the dishonour of other Princes, then any diminution of his glory in future ages; for as fortunes onely ought not to be esteemed vertues, so are heroical sufferings the highest marks of magnanimity and courage, with which his noble soul was plentifully furnished. To this the sweet Cloria made no other Reply, but by certain enflamed blushes, mixed with some tears that expressed notwithstanding an inward passion, at the remembrance of her Fathers disasters; which however she had formerly most abundantly bewailed: From these discourses the Queen entred into many particulars, concerning her young Son Narcissus , and her own adventures, both before and since she left the Island of Cyprus: In all these communications Cloria gave such answers, as neither shewed her partiality in those things that belonged to her private affairs, or wanted most solid reasons to fortifie her opinion of what appertained to the publick actions of others: Insomuch as Hyacinthia believed that her Daughter since her marriage, had not less encreased her knowledge and understanding in the Transactions of the times, then augmented the beauty and graces of her countenance, by a certain kinde of representing Majesty in her behaviour, and language, differing from her childehood, and fewness of years, when she was first taken away by the Pyrats at the City of Salamine . The next day being so belike designed by the Court, both Hyacinthia and her Daughter were conducted to a place without the walls of Damascus , where Orontes , and his mother were accustomed to make oftentimes their perambulations, as well for their more delightful Recreation, as to shew their glory and splendour to the admiring people, who to that purpose gazed afar off, as if Jupiter , and the other Gods, had determined there to make a round for the satisfaction of the inferiour world: Upon the first meeting Hyacinthia and the Princess Cloria descended from the Chariots, which being perceived by the Syrian King, both he and Andromida made haste to embrace the new stranger; the Ceremonies of either side were performed with so much seeming affection, as if onely this interview had broke all accords lately made with Hercrombrotus the Lydian Governour, though sealed with never so much assurance by the Syrian State; neither was Mazarius himself in person, wanting to compleat the Triumphs, in which posture with a most magnificent Train of Courtiers, the young King accompanied his fair Couzen, and her Mother, to a gallant Palace near his own, designed for their abode, and entertainment, whilst the Princesse Cloria should make the City of Damascus her abode, where they both remained, until a most exquisite Mask was prepared at Court, as well for Orontes exercise, as the Ladies delight; which for the excellency of the invention, and the richness of the habits, deserves this particular description. The first Representation was onely a large Curtain at the further end of a great Room, which being suddenly withdrawn, there appeared a most beautiful Temple, in a delicious Island; dedicated to God Apollo , as was demonstrated by many outward Inscriptions upon the Portico . It was not long before there issued out of the adjoyning Groves to that Sanctuary several Priests, where they seemed to have their Habitations; who at last made such an Assembly, that they prepared not onely for an orderly procession, in which posture they entred upon the stage, with musick, and performed the first Anti-Mask, but also went afterwards, and sacrificed to their Patron, upon a little Mount beyond the Temple, whereon stood an Altar of white Marble fixed to that purpose, out of which proceeded divers Currents of water, dispersed here and there into the neighbouring Sea. Scarce were their Devotions finished, when the Clouds over the Temple breaking in an instant, there appeared a clear and bright Heaven, where God Apollo himself sate in Majesty, upon his golden Chariot, drawn with flame-coloured Horses, wearing upon his Brows certain refulgent Rayes; which being extreamly illustrated by the cunning application of lighted Torches, (though not perceived visibly by the industry of any of the spectators) not onely magnified the skill and excellent invention of the Artist, but gave a singular delight and satisfaction to all the Company. Whilst every ones expectation was busied, what would be the further period of these Rarities, the sky again became obscured by divers black and compacted clouds, that with a certain kinde of melancholly Aspects, seemed to shade over the whole Island, so continuing until two or three Cracks of Thunder appeared forcibly to open once more the Element, out of which might be seen presently the God in a new habit, to descend crowned onely with a Poetical Laurel, and singing this Ditty to the excellent Musick of his silver Harp.  As that black flood, that spread the Grecian fields, Had left a slimy mud that Monsters yields, To Tempe Plain, I after came, To view the greenness of that pleasant place. Where Typhon in a dark some Cave below, As I past by in haste with bended bowe, Flew from his den, The bane of men, Deeming me sprung from humane race. But having straight with Darts the Dragon slain, I to the Christal streams of Peneus ran, To wash the blood, That stain'd the wood, Of those immortall shining arms. When suddenly fair Daphne from a Grove, With nimble feet to avoid my love, Took soon her flight, To shun my sight, That sought to win her by my Charms. Yet here alas methinks by much I see, A fairer Daphne in this place to be; For she most certainly is such an one, As Gods from heaven to earth must alwayes come, Clora's my Saint, my Love, my Queen shall be; Poor Daphne's nothing now but my lov'd Tree. No sooner had Apollo made an end of his Song, and was descending lower towards the stage in his Chariot, when there appeared in another part of the Heavens, sitting upon a bright Oriental Cloud, the God Mercury , who in this manner spoke to Apollo .  Apollo hark, great Jove doth call The Gods from earth t'assemble all, To keep Orsames blessed Feast, And young Orontes is his Guest; Which after Triumphs must be seen, At his own Court before his Queen. This being said, again mounting the sky, he obscured himself amongst the Clouds, whilst Apollo followed pronouncing this new Ditty.  Hark Mortals then I cannot stay, Great Jove commands, I must away; Yet heaven I leave on earth below, And rather would to Cloria bow: Though fates have thus on me decree'd, Il'e put me on a mourning weed, Till I again do here return; My love's on fire, my heart doth burn. Hark Mortals then I cannot stay, Great Jove commands, I must away. When Apollo again had entred the sky, of a sudden the whole Heavens in a higher Sphere began to move, and then the clouds severing at an instant, there appeared all the Gods, sitting upon their majestick Thrones, shining in mighty splendour, being carried about gently in a circular motion, until Jupiter taking his own Diadem, placed it upon the head of deceased Orsames , whilst his young Son Orontes kneeling near his Father, seemed to cast incense and perfume before the other Gods: These Ceremonies being ended, and another time the Heavens closed with the alteration of a new Scene, Orontes accompanied by a Troop of beautiful youths, was perceived from a delightful Mountain to descend towards the stage, where he performed the chief Mask-dance, with such a graceful activity, that made the whole Court equally to rejoyce and admire, which afterward was turned to the entertainment of the Ladies, according to their several degrees and qualities, wherein notwithstanding the Princess Cloria , had the prime place, as best deserving both for honour and beauty, yet would she not dance at all. As these magnificent Triumphs were designed to give the fair Cloria the more delightful welcome, being figured in love passages for her greater satisfaction; so contrary to her desire, wanton Cupid in the interim forgot not to play several parts, as he thought, to the advantage of his Mothers Dominion; insomuch as one Manchinus Nepew to the mighty Favourite Mazarius , being a youthful Masker in the Kings Troop, noting her beauty with all her excellent graces, became of a sudden extreamly taken, if not inflamed with her love: 'Tis true, the dignity of her quality, and the richness of her possessions, in others eyes seemed to be some obstacle to his pretentions; but on the other side, those flames kindled by a prosperous ambition, looked upon nothing but his own violent passions, joyned with the present commanding power of the Syrian Territories, when Orontes thoughts and actions appeared onely governed by the never contradicted councels of the wise and politick Mazarius , which made the youth (having by nature, a competency both of courage and proportion) when he was upon a time retired into his Chamber for his more privacy, to utter these expostulations to himself. Is it now Manchinus , said he, that the world must take notice of thy combats with a womans perfections? when Asia as yet was never able to contend against thy Uncles forces: Hath not hitherunto thy fortunate Family still prevailed, over all those Rebellions raised by powerful Condorosus and his whole Faction, Orestes himself being included in the number? As also hath constrained even the greatest Princes to match with thy sisters, whereby to procure their Dominions either safety, or more prosperity, and dost thou fear to attempt a Ladies liking, as it were driven out of her Countrey, because she had not countenance enough from the assistances of the Syrian Monarchy? What if her birth and blood claim never so near an interest in Orontes honour and dignity, hath not the power of Mazarius a higher influence in matter of State-proceedings, when all the affairs both of war and peace, seem to be directed and steered by his onely command and prescription? As Orontes cannot govern without thy Uncles advice, so must the King render him powerfullest, whereby the better to advise for his advantage, which will not be effected without adding such an eminency to our Family, as may make it not onely equal to others of the Nobility, but in some sort incorporate it with his own, whereby the machinations of proud Condorosus , may not too much presume upon that kindred and descent, that until now hath given him a title to the Crown, which continues his ambition at so great a rate, that all Syria can scarce bear the burthen of his distempers upon every occasion. Of the Princess CLORIA. fair Widow; nevertheless a certain kinde of dazling respect due to the majesty of her beauty, did alwayes deterre him from that resolution, as if some commanding deity shined in her eyes, the which for the most part sequestered him from his usual company: however sometimes being obscured by the night season, his hopes were raised to a further attempt; notwithstanding the light appearing again, contrary to the best effect of valour, that should inflame by varieties, made him quickly lay down (though not his love) yet the most probable means to obtain it; like to some bashful and cowardly Oratour, that had well studied his lesson in his Chamber, though when he was to pronounce it before a grave and learned auditory, was forced to desist from his purpose, not having confidence enough to utter any language at all. These contrary passions I must say, so over mastered the nature of the young man, that as his cheeks waxed pale with overmuch care; so were his words distracted to every bodies sence, as if he attended some inward object, belonging onely to his own heart: But nimble-sighted Mazarius instructed either by his ambition, or carried on by his interest, began to perceive from what fountain head, his Nephew had suckt in the chief poison of his disquiet; and to that purpose not doubting of his power, resolved to give him remedy, if before for his own advantage he had not projected the design, (since Statesmen are more taken with the aims of gain and honour, then provoked with love to their nearest kindred) so that he sent him away to the Wars of Pamphylia , as well for diversion as conveniency; and afterward one day calling Creses into his Bed- Chamber, he used this language unto him, with something a chearful countenance, himself being as he told him, speedily to follow the Camp: Creses , said he, to let you know how I have been your friend, since your banishment out of the Island of Cyprus , were not onely an impertinency in my own private judgement, but perhaps might render you doubtful of my opinion concerning your gratitudes, if not to your apprehension intimate; I go about to compel a nature that is both noble and honest, to those compliances that puts on a face of too much slavish subjection, when as the freedom of the soul is the thing most to be desired by all generous spirits; in which posture I must first lay before your consideration, the unfortunate condition of Euarchus house; then more nearly make you acquainted with what I earnestly seek, not altogether to satisfie my own appetite, but to good that family: Certain it is, that without the violent assistance of the Syrian Monarchy (as you cannot but conceive) neither Arethusius can be restored to the Lydian Crown, or his Sister return to her Countrey; the one being contented against by the opposition of all his own people, as the other debarred by domestick factions, from having interest in her natural childe, which is more desperate in effect in regard other States rather bend their thoughts towards their own affairs, then have a will to oppose oppression for Honours sake; as holding it a necessary Maxime of Policy, not to provoke enemies, whereby accident molestation may happen to their proper good: you know Creses , that Cyprus and Lydia are powerful at Sea, having made a combination together, to the apparent terrour of most Nations; so that as I said at first, those breaches that belong to these unfortunate Princess, are no way to be repaired, but by the power that my industry hath gained upon the King of Syria's affection; which your own thoughts will inform you, ought not to be imployed (or rather may I say hazzarded) in violent and doubtful events, without some probable ties of amity, that may give assurance I shall be repaid, with the constant continuance of love and affection, as well to my kindred as my self; since it is a derogation to wife Statesmen, to be circumvented in their designs, by giving too much truth to the variation of others natures. Here the Favourite stopt; whilst in the interim Creses (with a countenance that seemed as well mixed with sorrow for Euarchus Family, as troubled in consideration what Mazarius would desire) cast down his eyes upon the ground until the Favourite again began in this manner: Creses , said he, as many suitors in my outward rooms; cannot dispense with any long conferences of particular persons; so on the other side you cannot but remember, whose greatness hath chased proud and ambitious Condorosus out of the Syrian Dominions, the same power being now ready to follow him into the very heart of our enemies Countrey: This I say, and more must restore Arethusius again to the Lydian Crown, if Manchinus marry the Princess Cloria , whose youth, courage, and fortune can onely merit such a choice: In this service (believe it if you please) you are now invited to be instrumental, as well for your own benefit, as the preservation of that Family, who by such a contracted friendship, may hope once more to over-live all their misfortunes. After these words delivered, he parted from him with such a familiar and confident smile, as if he thought his own interest alone, could not onely render the intimation honourable, but command the success, without interruption. Creses having received this information from Mazarius the powerful Favourite, or rather might it be esteemed a peremptory injunction, though of a most distasteful nature, since as yet he was not able to lay down those appetites of his (more properly to be termed adorations) towards the Princess Cloria's beauty, retired presently out of the chamber, with such a violent haste, that sufficiently demonstrated the distemper of his minde; for however his own condition gave him no hopes of attempting so supream a happiness, yet could he not but be envious enough, that any other person of what fortune soever, should pretend to the chief object of his thoughts, with any probability of fruition, (humane nature being defective in that superlative goodness, as not easily to communicate to others those benefits it self cannot obtain) when his many steps and unruly passions, had carried him distractedly into an obscure Grove, not far from the Court, he imployed his imaginations in these several considerations: First he thought if he did now decline the service of the mighty Favourite, in this one particular, having in a manner formerly idolized his person (whose rage would swell equal as he thought to his power) he should not onely put himself from being esteemed amongst the many of his friends, but become the most palpable subject of his wrath; for his truth proving once suspected, his condition at the best could not be but contemned, and at the worst absolutely destroyed; however what most reflected upon his thoughts, were the ticklish conditions of Hyacinthia the Queen, that now again beginning to mount into some station of favour in the Syrian Court, by this omission would undoubtedly be thrown back to her former centre of disesteem; besides the destruction of all the hopes and designs of her Son Arethusius: Neither wanted the Princess Cloria's affairs a large part in his fear, whose well-doing and prosperity in the Island of Cyprus , depended much if not wholly upon the great Favourites grace and compliance, that necessarily could not be but obstructed, when (his Nephew being affronted in his intended Addresses) there would be kindled new fires of hatred and revenge. As these were the realities that exceedingly troubled Creses minde, so was his fancy if not tormented, yet something transported with other Chimera's, as that his own love and affection rather ought to be entertained then any others pretension, not reflecting at all upon the constant resolutions of the fair Widow, whose soul lay yet buried in the ashes of her dead Lord, unpossible to be revived by other objects, though promising never so much benefit to her present condition: But alas, love and fear are passions of too transcendent natures, to be altogether tempered by the meer force of reason; and this made him doubt what to do in his heavy imployment: Of one side considering if be moved not the suit, Euarchus's whole Family would be ruined; and on the other, if he propounded the match, considerations of benefit might take it received, though he wanted not some flatteries to accompany his thoughts; how that as Mazarius extraction was of too mean a blood to be coupled with such excellencies of nature and descent, so the wheel of fortune might again turn to his disadvantage, Orontes now approaching to riper years: Nevertheless one day in some fort to perform his trust, finding Queen Hyacinthia retired into a shady walk, either for the performance of her devotion, or the nourishing of her contemplations (though all company for that time was forbidden entrance, conceiving the authority of his commission to be powerful enough to bear out any petty Court regularity) of a sudden appeared before her sight, intending first to feel the mothers pulse, before what motion soever to this purpose should reach the daughters ears, and by that scantling be better able to carry himself in the rest of the imployment, wherein he was resolved, to mannage his affairs with some faith, but more love: Honour as well as Passion having a principal interest both in his nature and actions. Much discourse had not been between them before he saluted the Queen with this language according to his conceived injunction: Madam, said he, motions are but rendred effectual by their entertainment, and at the worst serve for admonitions, how dishonourable soever they be esteemed; whether of both mine at the present shall be interpreted, your own knowing judgement must be the arbitratour; for as by any means I am not willing to be taxed of fraud, so of the other side, presume I not to be a councellour, when as the determination ought rather to be governed by some heavenly influence, then fortified by a humane and weak capacity: 'Tis true, the great Favourite of Syria that seems to grasp the very face of all the world, hath designed me instrumental in that, wherein others might have been more willingly imployed; a hazzard too dangerous for any of our Nation to have refused, when as so mighty an interest lieth at the stake, of no less a value then the Lydian Crown; however the loyalty that shall still govern all my thoughts towards your Royal Family, will ever keep me from doing but what your commands must entirely direct. To intimate disparities by way of information, were in some sort a seeming presumption to teach you determinations, when as lights and colours can better be distinguished open by fair and clear eyes, then through deceitful opticks and artificial glasses; as I cannot deny my own sin in undertaking any thing at all without your privity, yet must expect a pardon, when the whole was unavoidable, in that you could not know but by my Commission, and in not knowing, some surprize might have been to your disadvantage; wherefore at the worst you have now leasure, either to deny with better consideration, or to grant to more efficacy. In fine Madam, the short I have more to say is, that Manchinus would marry the most sacred Princess Cloria your fair and vertuous Daughter: To such a height is ambition flown in this unworthy age, that scarce can the Gods maintain their own Dignities in purity, without the prophanation of the inferiour world, which period must and shall end my Commission. The Queen (whether over-much surprized by such an unexpected discourse, or something doubting the never before suspected integrity of Creses intentions) gave him no answer at all, but with her eyes stedfastly fixed upon the earth, remained for a pretty space in a deep muse; until at last casting up her looks towards the Heavens, she cried out aloud, you immortal Gods defend at leastwise, the Rights of Sovereign Princes from shame and ignominy, though you have destroyed their power and Jurisdiction in Euarchus Family; with these words in hasty steps he departed from those solitary walks: It was not many dayes after this Overture ( Mazarius being already gone to the Army) that Hyacinthia one afternoon accompanied by her Daughter, and attended by many of her servants, with a kinde of seeming passion, uttered this language in all their hearings. Is it possible, said she, that nothing can content the Favourites ambition, ( Condorosus being driven both from his Countrey and possessions) but those presumptions, that must either mix his blood with the Syrian Royalty, or destroy for ever our hopeful pretentions to the Lydian Crowns? Was it not sufficient for his pernicious policy to have outed our probabilities by that base accord he hath made with Hercrombrotus , (wherein in effect we remain banished persons) but must impose upon us new dishonours by such an intended conjunction, that after ages will tearm ominous to all honest glories? Where are the high extractions of that eminent Politician, that after so many affronts, should make us willing to entertain an alliance, whereby to confirm all our unparallel'd disgraces? Perhaps he thinks the infamy may be coloured over with some false shews of Complements; when as realities are as little to be expected from him, as the disadvantages to us hitherunto, could have been believed by persons of common sense and understanding: No, no, the Titular Deities of Euarchus Monarchy can never protect the justness of our Titles, yielding upon what hopes soever to such low and poor propositions; how must I value the courage of Arethusius , who could not be won by dissembling protestations, to entertain correspondency, contrary to the dignity of his Birth, with a man, that makes his words to comply onely with his ends, and his ends nothing but Panders for his profit: No Cloria , 'tis you onely that are designed the footstool for the proud Favourites ambition, to mount up to Olympus , whilst in the mean time he treads down the honour of Princes, whereby to render his ascent the easier; however not by orderly and fair courses of vertue, but by contrary effects of craft and deceit, as if the world were to be changed by his power, from the nature and intention of its first creation. Alas! alas! beardless Manchinus , and more naked of all Royalty, must succeed to that gallant bravery of immortal Narcissus , whose high extraction and ample worth, eternity can onely Crown with a Diadem befitting such a fame. Whilst the Queen was delivering these appearing extravagancies, (in some sort so to be interpreted, being uttered in too great an assembly, since her present condition rather required dissimulation then provocation) the sweet Princess sate by her Mother, like some curious statue wanting any appearing motion, but what her plentifull tears by degrees demonstrated to the company, which sufficiently shewed forth her inward forcible apprehensions, though her own modest duty durst not at the instant venture upon a reply; but within a while she retired into her own proper appartament, having there a great deal better leasure, and much more time, not onely to imagine but to consider, both what she was already in the honour of her person, and what others would have her to be for their own advantage: Whilst Cloria was thus, for some days shut up in her voluntary solitude, though under pretences of indisposition rather then discontent, some of the Queens own Court, fearing too much the Favourites spleen, if he should finde himself crost in this intended match; doubting more particularly, those Pensions of Syria , that belonged to their Mistress, might suddenly be restrained to all their losses, not onely by discourses amongst themselves entertained Mazarius offers; but one of the chiefest about Hyacinthia's person, (when she was private in her lodgings) expostulated with her these considerations. Madam, said he, as Reasons ought to be given in doubtful opinions, by any condition whatsoever, when safety and benefits are required, so of the other side, you must afford me that liberty (having alwayes run along with your fortunes and concernments) to demand some satisfaction of your particular, why you seem so violent against the Favourites propositions; especially coming accompanied with more then his ordinary desire, when as scarce dwells there a Prince in Asia's continent how powerful soever in riches, or strongly settled in Jurisdictions, but rather covets then refuses his alliance; knowing the greatness of his command, and the sharpness of his spleen; to which purpose I beseech you consider, the desperate condition of all your Family, not onely your self depending wholly for necessary subsistance upon the Syrian benevolence, which he rules at his pleasure, but your very Son and Daughter that claim inheritance in a just Right, are forced at present to quit their own Countreys, no way again to be rectified but by his Interest. Is it his birth that renders you averse to his aims? If so, its a scruple, that rather belongs to the glorious Nation from whence you are descended, that should principally provide for the dishonour, since no time can blot out the remembrance of your extraction, then to your self, in yielding to such Nuptials, when as not onely your pressing occasions needs the strongest assistance, but the approbation comes from the greatest authority now in the world: But if it be your revenge to the Favourites former proceedings, in not gooding Euarchus cause to the uttermost of his power, as you may be very well deceived in your apprehensions, (State Affairs being to be ordered by policy and temper) so of the other side, you must not seek a requital, that at the last will leave you absolutely overcome, and he never the worse, either in fortune or command; smoothered injuries not seldom gain strength, to become powerful, when as flames of discontent breaking forth, for the most part do but consume and destroy with greater violence: Experience may very well teach you, no blood or pretence can long contend against his power in this Region, if at all in any Territory of Asia: When Princes of other Countreys bestow their Children upon his Family, and those of the highest rank in this Kingdom must not live securely here, because they will not readily obey his desires: However methinks I hear whispered in my ears, that this superlative favour cannot last long, the Queen growing old, and the King coming to riper years; the one leaving her employment, as the other changing his minion. To which I must reply, neither of which can bring you advantage; for though Andromida should lose her interest with her son, yet could not Orontes withdraw his favour from Mazarius person, in regard all necessary affairs, are inclosed in the vaste compass of his secret knowledge, if not executed onely by the constant endeavours of his meerly obliged creatures; for however the King should alter the appetites of his youth, by the contracting of other affections, yet the fabrick of the affairs of Syria must fall to the ground, if that great Ingeneer should not lend his helping hand to the violence of the motion: Besides I must say, new Ministers of State probably would cast off old objects; and consequently your concernments could not be but neglected; especially when expence and trouble must infallibly accompany the enterprize; being at the best hazzardable, and at the worst not profitable for the Nation: Wherefore, dear Madam, banish from your thoughts these unhappy passions, that lay you open to a further revenge, then you can possibly resist with any safety; when of the contrary, by a wise compliance in the Favourites purpose, you may fortunately break the knot of the alliance with Hercrombrotus , that in a manner now deters all other Princes, from giving your wrongs, either assistance or countenance. Although these and such like discourses seemed in some sort to work upon the Queens constancy, looking on one side upon her own wants, and on the other side beholding her Childrens distractions, yet noble minded Cloria (doubting a little her Mothers fortitude, her thoughts being made up between a resolved sadness for her Husbands loss, and solicitous care for the honour of her Fathers Family) in no kinde could bring her heart to allow of the propositions; though again the condition of her young Son, made her oftentimes with a certain kinde of pale doubt, tremble at the very apprehension of her fate; this caused her not seldom to shed multitudes of tears, as tributes not onely to her sorrow but to her consideration, until as it should seem overmuch prest by the feared authority of a Mothers priviledge to a final resolution, at leastwise so interpreted by her wavering fancy, she determined secretly to leave Syria: However not to seem over precipitate in her opinions, she designed to make Creses acquainted with her purpose, by whose faithful counsel as she believed, she might tread forth paths of some security, in the dark Labyrinth of her fortunes; wherefore one day early in the morning, meeting him by accident in certain Walks belonging to the Court, where she was accustomed often to make her own recreations, after a very short salute, she began in this manner to utter her minde, (passion having then the greatest predominancy in appearance in her resolution) but scarce had she delivered three words, as it were a little cowardly falling from her first determination, she stopt again with some pawses, which were quickly followed by many tears, and those at last opening the passages of her courage, she more boldly delivered her thoughts unto him. Creses , said she, the confidence I have ever had in your integrity, makes me now demand counsel of your wisdom, in that which I could wish might never be remembred; since as it must needs be an infamy to the glory of the Royal Family, so cannot the issue be esteemed otherwise then desperate, when weak honour is to contend against powerful violence: You see how strongly I am prest to this second match, not onely by the great Favourites ambition, that appears in a manner to stear the worlds fate, but also by a Mother pressing necessities, that cries out for my compliance: If I yield to the desire, I must quit that faith which with many protestations I intended to carry along with me to my grave; and if I do not condescend to a new love, I am told young Arethusius pretensions must perish by reason of my obstinacy, since Mazarius is as unremoveable in his aims, as uncontroulable in his power; so that a furious revenge must be expected, instead of the least pacification for our remedy; followed no doubt as they pretend, by an entire obstruction of the Queens Pensions, if not a quick banishment of her Person out of all the Kings Dominions, according to those accords lately made with Hercrombrotus fortunes; besides as not the least terrour to my thoughts, you know my little Son, doth not onely depend upon this State for his future jurisdiction over the Island of Cyprus , but a great part of his hereditary Territories, lies within the heart of the Syrian Kingdom: These perplexities dear Creses do accompany Narcissus's unhappy Widow, who notwithstanding is resolved, to pay the last tribute of her life to his love and memory, rather then ever joyn again with what greatness soever, notwithstanding any advantages can be offered to my present condition: wherefore all I have to say more is, that if I remain still in this Court without satisfying the Favourites desire, I must not onely subject my self to all the affronts can possibly be invented to my disgrace and vexation; but returning again to my own Countrey, my Mother-in- law will prosecute my interest with a new power and spleen; nothing having hitherunto kept her thoughts in any decorum of temper, but the meer opinion of my near descent from the Syrian blood; to all these difficulties as a councellour I require your advice, and as a friend, expect it should be faithful, which obligation I promise shall never be forgotten, if Cloria , if she mount again into any degree of consideration, whereby to pleasure those that have been serviceable to her particular: With these words the sweet Princess distilled a plentiful showre of her own tears, as if the Gods intended a new refreshment of those walks, by so delicate and heavenly a moisture, proceeding from the hard occasion of such conceived injuries: But Creses seemingly struck also with an unexpressible sorrow, for a long time rested silent with water in his eyes; though on the other side he was taken with some gladness, that in no kinde she intended to entertain the motion; however he was forced to return her this onely answer, because he would say something, fearing belike too much the consequence of the point he was to discourse upon, without a more longer premeditation: Most excellent Princess, said he, as the difficulties you have mentioned, seem to be of a nature beyond the reach of my capacity to resolve, when not onely Crowns, but your own sacred Person (to be valued more then they) are in question; so the services that I have vowed to your self and Royal Family are sufficient testimonies, that I shall ever esteem my self, but a base and contemptible sacrifice, to be offered upon the altar of your pleasure, when you shall command any thing to be obeyed: Notwithanding in these exigencies your noble and wise Mother (according to my apprehension) were the fittest Oracle to be consulted, before you determine any course or resolution, as a period to the action: Cloria however she could not much finde fault, with the discreet and reserved precaution, of the most faithful and ever esteemed affectionate Creses , yet by those consequences she might very well perceive his opinion, concerning the dangerous condition of her affairs; so that when she had walked some few turns more in the Garden (in the interim not entertaining him with discourses) she made some haste towards her own lodgings, where after a while, being retired into the most solitary part of her chamber, having first commanded all her servants to several imployments, her melancholly apprehension, framed these fancies in her imagination, which broke out also into passionate expressions. Cloria, Cloria , said she, the most unfortunate creature of all thy generation, since no region can bring settlement to thy thoughts, or pretended friendships true enough to secure thy actions; Mothers being won by ends from their natural indulgencies, and Servants never so much obliged to be trusted in resolutions: You Gods, said she, whither shall innocent intentions flye for succour, or a religious faith purchase establishment: Then taking a small picture she had in her bosome, belonging to her dear Lord, after some tears had paid the first sacrifice to that lively representation, she added these sayings to her former discourse: With what eyes of pitty and compassion can thy noble soul said she, look down from the highest heavens, at thy Cloria's past sorrow, if she should now entertain new Nuptials, with a man that is as far short of thy admirable worth, as his birth is below thy glorious extractions? Shall those blest sympathies (at our first interview) created in our mindes by some powerful influence, onely intended for eternity, be thus violently severed for nothing but to compass some few humane respects? which notwithstanding either envy or jealousie may destroy, though greatness and authority should continue; when promises and conditions would be as little regarded, as consent and compliance in the beginning was easily obtained: No, no, Cloria , as vertue and consideration made thee in the beginning, the beloved Wife of brave and heroical Narcissus , so let the same fortitude and affection, continue thee still victorious against all malicious assaults to the contrary, leaving Syria to its glory, as thy self to adverse fortune; in which adventure thou shalt but accompany thy Brother Arethusius in his fate, whose blood and worth hath not yet gained him a competent respect in the Councels of Damascus , either to render him powerful to contend against his enemy Hercrombrotus , or to free his person from the ignominy of an unkinde banishment, out of that very place, where he deserved to have most interest. Although the Princess Cloria after these passions uttered, determined speedily to put in execution, what her fancy rather contrived, then her judgement premeditated, since a secret flight without her Mothers approbation, would have caused a danger, if not a wonder; yet the sudden arrival of Philogenia the Scythian Queen, at the great City of Damascus , gave necessarily some interruption to her determination; not onely for that it was imagined she was sent from the Arch-Flamin of Delphos , to solicit the general peace, but also in regard all persons of quality were to give her reception: The triumphs belonging to this Lady were performed with extraordinary ceremony, until at last they brought her resolution to give a visit to Hyacinthia the Queen, sweet Cloria being then in her company: When many discourses had past between them of trivial natures, at leastwise so esteemed by those whose thoughts were busied alwayes about other solicitations, at last in a more serious manner, she uttered this language to Philogenia: Madam, said she, as the greatness of your fame, makes all the world cast their eyes upon your person, thinking to finde out miracles instead of ordinary commendations, in those vertues you have purchased both by birth and education; yet nothing in my opinion seems more to contribute to your honour, then the long journey at present you have taken (as it is conceived) to make some union between the two exasperated Princes, whose long contention hath so much disturbed and impoverished all Asia ; in which work I must tell you, you shall not onely render the immortal Gods most eminent service, by stopping the current to so much blood and slaughter, but procure the prayers of many disconsolated Princes, whose oppressions continue in a high measure, by reason of these differences: Philogenia belike not expecting such a publick overture, stood for some time without any Reply, but her wit being esteemed excellent, and her ambition too great to study any thing long for an answer, made haste to return this language. Most mighty Queen, said she, if by the reflection of your beauty and merits, I can gain some esteem among the common people, it is a favour I shall onely covet to enjoy, when as my own endowments both in person and understanding, are so poor and barren, that I must beseech your authority onely, to keep me from reproach and ignominy amongst the better sort, who I fear without such a powerful help, will scarce be perswaded to that indulgent charity in my behalf: But for my employment, although I cannot brag of any large Commission from the holy Flamin of Delphos , as perhaps not judging me capable of such a service, wherein is concerned both the Gods honour, and most Princes safety, yet have I vowed all my endeavours to so blest a purpose, wherein the surviving Family of good and great Euarchus , must have a principal share in my thoughts and industry. As these Complements soon parted the two Queens, Hyacinthia to a larger consideration of her encreasing troubles, and Philogenia to the further prosecution of her journey, so began Cloria anew to reflect upon her own condition, which caused her for some weeks to toss over many uncertainties in her unquiet bosome; and although in the beginning, her passionate apprehensions made her something violent, to quit Syria in a disguized posture, unknown to all her friends; yet upon better recollection, she thought it a safer way, both for her voyage and reputation, to contrive some feigned Letter from her Brother Arethusius , now remaining, as she heard, in the Countrey of Pamphilia , as if his indisposition in health, had conjured her personall presence with all expedition, whereby to render him satisfied in many things belonging to them both: In this adventure she designed Creses for her Companion, though no man living had a harder part to act, between his unwilling trust and her feared jealousie; for if he waved Mazarius Interest, he doubted Arethusius ruine; and if he lost Cloria's favour, all the world besides was nothing to his thoughts; however he determined to deceive neither; for as his admiration of the Princesse perfections, withheld him inwardly from wishing success to his obligation, so was it sufficient in his opinion, that he had once moved the business; therefore from hence forward intended to be onely passive: This resolution in some sort quieted Creses imagination, until a few Ceremonies with a small train had set them both free from the City of Damascus , whilst the rest of Cloria's company were commanded in her absence to other employments; but although the importunity of their journey, had sufficiently diverted many troublesome thoughts, from the now more settled minde of faithful Creses , yet in the way he held it not amiss, to entertain the Princess with this manner of discourse; and the rather for that he was not fully satisfied, that he had formerly contented her expectation, concerning those complaints she had made unto him, belonging to the propounded match of young Manchinus the Favourites Nephew: Madam, said he, as it should seem some blessed fate hath now provided for your Councels, which your most faithful servant durst not well adventure to offer, believing the highest Heavens would alwayes have a special care over your laudable purposes, so much tending to the immortal Gods honour; yet now if mortals may take leave to judge of things meerly divine, in that they concern the safety of your noble Family, the course you have taken for your own advantage, cannot be bettered by any alteration, since as accident, or rather may it be termed necessity, seemeth at present to call you from the Syrian Court, so cannot the great Favourite finde fault with design, but chance, concerning your absence; in which interim you have leasure and commodity sufficient by your dear Brothers advice, to contrive not onely your own safety and your sons welfare, but also his and your Mothers future prosperity, not being subject to be prest beyond conveniency, whereby to fall upon precipitations, nor forced in your person to become distasteful to mighty powers; for liberty (no doubt) is the most essential part of worldly felicity. The Princess a little smiling at Creses complements, (not otherwise to be esteemed as she thought, since in the beginning he appeared so cautious in his advice, when her thoughts were more burthened then at the present) after a short pause made him this reply, savouring something of reproof, though much of confidence. Creses , said she, you do well to varnish over your present trust with quaint language, seeing the time was once, when either your courage or your fidelity gave cause sufficient of suspition, if not of condemnation to jealous natures; yet that you may plainly see I am none of that number, let it suffice you receive pardon concerning your last fears, accompanied also with these reasons; that as gratitude to the Favourites benefits is a vertue you ought alwayes to preserve in your intentions, especially when you might think my words and apprehensions, were more governed by passion then consideration; so have you now an absolute confirmation of my forgiveness by this journey: Creses though he seemed extream joyful to be so probably assured of her opinion, (for that love cannot be satisfied with any doubts) yet nevertheless to render her still more confident of his faith, he cast forth a world of other protestations; but the Princess being rather wearied by his abundant expressions, then that his words could have altered her belief, if her own judgement had not approved the testimony, willed him to leave off those impertinencies, since her declared satisfaction in point of honour, was sufficient to quiet his minde in that particular, although she had not brought him out of Syria in her Company, as the strongest argument of her continued favour: Cloria was desirous to put off this manner of discourse for the present, yet having the main matter of her Brothers Affairs, more sollicitous in her minde, (nature ever pointing at what most it covets either to obtain or prevent) she wisht Creses to inform her, concerning the Favourites chief purposes, according to any knowledge himself hath procured by attendance; however she did not believe, as she said, he was accustomed to acquaint many with his most secret designs. Truly Madam, said he, as you are absolutely in the right, to think that very few are intrusted with the deep mysteries of his bosome, since Statesmen for the most part fear sinister interpretations upon their best intentions, so shall I according to your commands by my own little skill, make you acquainted with something, though perhaps more what I fancy, then what I can read of him by any certain learning; for natures being various, conjectures must be uncertain; but if I may judge, the highest flames in the world of ambition, predominant in his disposition, though scarce to be esteemed a fault, as he believes, by such spirits as are worthy of eminent employments; which I cannot deny but carries him on often, to those actions that appears not authentical enough to common understandings; at leastwise to men esteemed more just then wise, who know the better the strict rules of right, then take the pains to examine the reason of things, that are not to be known but by the inward conscience of the parties transacting; for as what is done however good and not well meant, cannot in any kinde be meritorious, so the contrary perhaps with a perswaded integrity, may sometimes defend people from the guilt of errour, and at the worst makes them less criminal, since ambition is not alwayes a sin, but comming accompanied with too much violence, or some premeditated injury: 'Tis certainly seen, that Mazarius hath continued a war to the excessive prejudice of all Asia , whereby Countreys are impoverished, and Families ruined; besides the hazzard of the Delphin Religion: But whether his motives are chiefly to maintain his Masters Rights, or advance his own glory, the question must rest undetermined; since Titles are often pretended to procure other ends, with onely a better seeming face of Justice to satisfie other appetites not altogether lawful in themselves, though in my opinion, where the dammage doth much exceed the benefit, the extremity cannot well be justified by a religious obligation. 'Tis true, replied Cloria , if it should be lawful for a little gain, to disturb multitudes of people, the cure would be much worse then the disease; especially when innocents of both sides were sure infinitely to suffer, let the right or the occasion be what it will; and consequently of a most dangerous nature to disturb ancient possessions upon light grounds: But I should be glad, said she, to understand more particularly the differences between our great King of Syria , and the mighty Monarch of Egypt , since various conjectures are made concerning each of their proceedings; however in nature there can be but one right; and though ignorance I must confess oftentimes may be a sufficient plea, yet never but where the circumstances are either well considered, or else possible to be understood. Madam, replyed Creses , the best way to understand the pretentions of both these Kings, is to lay down methodically what each Countrey sayes for it self; in the first place the Egyptians affirm, that notwithstanding Orontes might have a good title in the War (which however they will in no case grant) yet in disturbing the general peace of Asia with blood and slaughters, against a States long possession also united with him in one alliance, and the same Religion, is a crime sufficient, to render the Gods displeased with the action; especially when a friendship is required on the other side, by all the demonstrations of love and affection, can be desired by free and absolute Princes; and furthermore to make good the difference in success, as well as in contention, it is alledged, that the great Favourite Mazarius , not seldom makes use of the greatest enemies to the faith and practice of the Arch- Flamin of Delphos , whereby to become more powerful in his designs, in the interim delivering over to their jurisdiction, the best Towns and Territories he conquers in the Countrey of Pamphylia , whereby as the Egyptians say, the true Worship of the Gods is in apparent danger to be lost, and destroyed in that Region, where never before any of that practice had being or subsistance; so that necessarily in time the Subjects of Pamphylia , must either be perverted in their belief, or tormented in their persons, being not able to endure subjection under a Government, that would have alwayes when they pleased, strength enough to compel them to their opinions, though never understanding or will sufficient in themselves to be converted, notwithstanding any perswasion, or reason could be offered to their consideration; in that both the maximes and benefits belonging to misbelievers, will alwayes thrust them on to be as well cruel as obstinate: On the other side, the Syrians maintain, that as the Egyptian Kings have alwayes aimed at the sole Empire of the world, to the endangering, if not subversion of lesser Principalities and Jurisdictions, so do they nourish at present, nothing but rebellions and factions within the very heart of Orontes Kingdom, refusing any accord at all, unless obstinate Condorosus be absolutely restored, to his offices and dignities within the Countrey and Dominions of Syria ; notwithstanding his stubborn and violent contentions against his King, wants both submission and assurance, necessary for so great a trust and confidence, belonging to his future obedience; which as it is thought most startles the Favourites fears, doubting that Princes friends, and knowing his spirit; two essential points to be considered for his own proper safety; for if by admittance without any restriction he should get power, 'tis known he is irreconcilable by the unrelenting condition of his nature being a man so full of honour in his own person, that he cannot possibly forget injuries done to himself by another: These Madam I may say, are either the pretences, or realities of both Nations, whereupon depends the main differences of their contention. The Princess a little smiling at this discourse told him, that she believed he had yet omitted the greatest cause of the continued War, though at the beginning perhaps other reasons made the breach: Creses seeming willing to understand any thing of information that should proceed from such dainty lips, Cloria quickly delivered these particulars, however with a pretty kinde of careless expression, that although it wanted the formalities of Method, yet shewed by the manner of her language, that she very well knew both the consequence of the matter, and an order sufficient for the relation. Creses , said she, as I will not challenge to my self the learning, or knowledge of political rules, which for the most part are framed in the working brains of ambitious Satesmen, though oftentimes set in action more by craft then honesty, yet give me leave to inform you of two other principal matters, that perchance carry as great an influence in the continued differences, as those things you have already named: The one is those promises and tyes of honour, which the Syrian State pretends to have made with the Prince of Carthage , when he possest himself at first of that Territory, belonging to his pretended right, that the former Kings of Egypt many years by strong hand withheld from his jurisdiction, which Orontes would have now comprehended within the Treaty of Peace, or else to be at liberty himself notwithstanding any agreement, to assist that Countrey in matters of War and Contention: The other of a more secret and conjectural nature, since the Councel of Syria will scarce seem to own the intention; and that is, Osiris now King of Egypt , having no children, but one onely Daughter, that in all probability must be his Kingdoms Heir, both the Queen and Mazarius would procure the match for the young King of Syria , which the pride of the Egyptians will not hear of, in regard that if their own Prince should dye without more issue, their Dominion necessarily must come under the Syrian power and subjection; a Government that neither their dispositions, nor their spirits can indure, in respect of those high Antipathies in humours and education between the two Nations. Most excellent Princess, replyed Creses, as I will not brag much of my own intelligence, to have as yet reached this last mystery of State, so cannot my fancy otherwise then meet with the same reason, more especially coming from your admired self; since the ambitions of the great Favourite are known, alwayes to aim at extraordinary periods: so that I must conclude, the intended match is an occasion, likelier to fortifie the pretentions of War, then to procure a lasting friendship; since it cannot be but a very difficult work, to bring the Egyptian thoughts to undergo what subjection soever to the Syrian Nation; being a people of all others most enflamed with appetites of honour, and so consequently will rather chuse to marry the young Lady to one of Artaxis family, then to Orontes , whereby still to retain an unity between the two Countries of Egypt and Armenia , the convenienter to oppose alwayes the growing greatness of the Kingdom of Syria , that lieth between both Dominions; envy being the most predominate humour, that for the most part governs the actions of Princes, in matter of equality of power; neither at all times doth contracted marriages, hinder jealousies procured by reason of National quarrels, and seldom make friendships of a confident nature, when subjection thereby are feared; especially where the reputation of the party that undergoes the hazzard, is sure to be lessened in opinion: But the assurance either given or expected, replyed Cloria , will consist, in that the Syrians must disavow all title to the Crown of Egypt , though accident should cast the succession by inheritance to their right, though not into their power. O Madam said Creses , these conditions will alwayes be disputable, if Princes finde their power at any time sufficient to contend, Swords being likelier to plead the cause then Paper: Besides it is in some sort a maxime belonging to the Law of Nations, that fundamentals of States and Empires cannot be given away, or altered from the usual course of succession, by any present Governours in possession, since the people as well as the Prince, have a right and interest in the change, being not to be transferred in their subjection; for that the promise of obedience upon the first institution of any Commonwealth or Dominion, was upon such condition then agreed upon, therefore not justly alterable but by consent, not onely of the whole body, but of the succeeding heirs of each party: 'Tis true, sometimes Countries gained by conquest, are forced from those priviledges, where oppressions and tyranny prevails; however in such cases also, for the most part, either old contracts are confirmed, or new agreements made, before the Subjects can be brought to any willing and quiet obedience, towards the satisfaction of their new Lord. But what answer said the Princess, can you give to the other obstacle I mentioned concerning the King of Carthage's Title or Interest: Verily Madam, replyed Creses , I conceive it to be almost of as difficult a nature to be composed as the former; since as that Prince would be extreamly unwilling to fall again under his old masters jurisdiction, having already to the uttermost of his power, exasperated his spleen, by many hostile contentions, which probably cannot be forgotten, when the means and the opportunity for a revenge is offered; so of the other side continual jealousies will alwayes stir up the resolution of him in command, either by the envy or flattery of others to quit himself totally of his fears; besides it must be remembred, that dominion is seldome quitted but with destruction, examples being most frequent in all stories to that purpose; so that in my opinion, either Orontes must wave his engagement entirely, or the Carthaginians become absolute Tributary to the King of Egypt , if any agreement at all be made between these mighty Monarchs, whose differences onely seem now to trouble the whole world. Such like discourses as these, seemed to pass away the time for some dayes travel, until at last they arrived upon the Confines of Pamphilia ; however scarce had they entred the Countrey, when Cloria and Creses riding through a Wood, (being onely attended by the Dwarf the Princess constant servant, the rest of the Train having had orders, to take up their lodgings for the night to come, in a fair Town belonging to the Jurisdiction of both Dominions) but they heard a kinde of a soft musick, at no great distance from them; whereupon making a little stand, they perceived it accompanied with a most excellent voice, which quickly invited their curiosity thitherward. As they drew nearer to the place from whence it seemed to proceed, they might behold a natural Grotto, made up without any art at all, by the opposition onely of two little Rocks, that either altogether joyned it at the top, or else because it was so shaded by a dainty flourishing Grove; the separation could not well be distinguished, though the scituation being a little mounted over the other ground, (from which also came a clear current of water) they might not onely discern the spaciousness of the Cave, but in it a Lady sitting near a fountain with her Lute in her hand, waited upon by a Page and two or three other female attendants: No sooner did she see them approaching, but she rose up from her seat, laying her Instrument upon a stone Table not far from her, and presently came out of the Bower with confidence sufficient, either to salute them as they thought, or satisfie her own curiosity. Cloria and Creses stood still, as it were, something surprized with this encounter, judging her beauty to have been perfect, if declining age had not a little obscured the lustre of her countenance, as it were resembling a shade drawn over a flourishing Meadow, which however the comeliness of her presence (seemingly made up between majesty and affability) used her decayes in their apprehensions to the best advantage, rather shewing thereby nature her imperfections, (since she was unable to conserve, what she had framed) then the party her self appeared much displeased, to have lost the greenness of her youth; her habit in some sort answering to their conjectures of her minde, both grave and becoming, neither inclinable to entice Courtship, or altogether to throw it away when it was offered; which opinion made the Princess Cloria (after a while) address her self to a salute with this language in her mouth, leaving the state of her quality also in the design, as she had in her journey already for other Reasons. Lady, said she, as we may hope easily for pardon, (being strangers to the Country) if our accidental arrival in this place, hath brought you any incommodity, (since however perhaps it be not the readiest way for travellers, yet were we invited hither by the deliciousness of the prospect) so for my part, finding the appearing affability of your nature, by your putting your self in this posture at the entrance of your Grotto , I could do no less but render my Respects to your acceptance. Scarce had Cloria uttered these few words, but the Lady confirming her breeding by her courtesie, not onely desired her descent from her horse, but advanced presently to be assistant in the service: The Princess thus encouraged (being willing by this occasion to avoid some part of the heat of the afternoon) quickly dismounted by the help of Creses and her Page, where after a short and civil encounter, the Lady conducted her into the Cave; when they were there seated together, the Princess informed her, that being a near Kinswoman of Arethusius the Lydian King, whom she understood was lately come into the Dominions of Pamphilia , belonging to the great Monarch of Egypt , to whose habitation and abode she with her small company was now travelling; wherefore should esteem it a happiness in her journey, to receive some instructions to that purpose, since she could not be so ignorant, but to be something doubtful concerning the safety of the passage, when the whole Countrey seemed to be troubled with Souldiers quartering, by reasons of those accidents of war still continuing between the exasperated Princes: The Lady whose name was Amarillia , after two or three deep sighs had ushered in the discourse, replied in this manner. Truly Madam, said she, as the generality of the people of this poor and almost ruined Province of Pamphilia , hath cause enough to lament their condition, not onely by reason of the violence, but the endlessness of the quarrel, so cannot I tell with what manner of security, you can possibly attempt a journey at present, to that noble Prince you mention; for that both himself and the Syrian Condorosus , are now, as we are informed, besieged within the Walls of a Haven Town called Deorcas , by the Forces of Orontes and the Lydian General; however if you hold it necessary, to be more instructed in the truth of these Reports, (you may be pleased in the interim (whilst you send to enquire) repose your person in a Castle of mine, not far distant from this place, where, however I cannot promise your entertainment, shall equal your worth, yet your welcome will be according to your occasions; and though I shall enjoy a most supream honour in the service, your self also may perhaps gain some commodity by the station: Cloria startled a little at this advertisement, yet upon consideration she became competently satisfied, to have so convenient a habitation for her retirement, wherefore quickly returned her this answer. Madam, said she, as most commonly noble natures are perceived by bounties freely offered to people in necessity; so on the other side, as I intend to be grateful in my acknowledgement, so will I not do that injury to your courtesie, as any way seem to refuse that offer which appears now to be my best conveniency; onely I must take leave of your civility, to have some little conference with the party that came along with me, as well to contrive that intelligence which I intend to seek, as to give some particular order about those followers of mine, that are already gone to a Town (as I am informed) not very far distant from these Woods; where my self thought to have lodged this night, if I had not been prevented, both by your goodness and information. The Lady would have called Creses into the Cave, leaving the Room to their privacy; but Cloria in no wise would permit, either her trouble in that particular, or her quitting the possession of the Grotto; saying, the pleasant Grove before the entrance of her exquisite retirement, would not afford her onely a sufficient conveniency for her affairs, but a most perfect delight in her communications. A long time the Princess and Creses disputed their own resolutions, in regard that one imagination seemed to thrust out another; as it fareth for the most part in doubtful Affairs, when fear and desire meet in the Centre of equall contention; untill at last they concluded upon this execution: That Creses early in the morning (after he had waited upon the Princess to the Ladies Castle) should take a further journey towards Deorcas , as well to inform himself, concerning the present siege of that Town, as of the well being of the Prince Arethusius ; and so by consequence to learn, not onely where he remained, but also how Cloria with the best conveniency could arrive at the place of his habitation. When the Princess had ended her determinations in these particulars, she returned again to the Cave, where she found Amarillia again at her Lute, which shewed, as practice had made her excellent in the profession, so the natural delight she took in Musick, had rendred her industrious in the pains; however she offered to leave off her employment, upon their second entrance; but Cloria was so far from entertaining the intention, that she not onely with a pretty kinde of violence kept her still in the seat, but by many graceful Complements conjured her, not to deprive her senses of that happiness, since her reason already had been so fully satisfied in her other vertues; which quickly brought forth this Ditty, accompanied by her Instrument.  'Twas not the brightness of his eyes, Howe're appear'd like breaking skies, That could prevail With open sail, To gain the Fort so long besieg'd, Though time and place had oft oblig'd. Much less was it a powerful love, Descending from the Clouds above, Cloath'd like a Dove, And so could move; But rather an ambitious flame, That from a vulgar fancy came: Yet must he needs be thought unjust, Though beauty now begins to rust, To wave a truth Seal'd up in youth; Since his impression onely made Those glories great now turn a shade. For natures law will not allow The constant smoothness of a brow, When as the Spring Doth never bring; So fairly colour'd flowers bear, Which will not fail as frosts appear. But if he will no honour shew, In keeping still the faith that's due; This purchaste ill Must have its fill, And shrowded be from love or hate, Till fates have run their utmost date. When she had made an end of this Song, by a gentle smile and a few tears, she cast her looks upon the Princess Cloria , as if she did not onely accuse her self of some great guilt, but seemed also in a sort to beg her opinion: But the sweet Princess, although she might have sufficient cause given her of suspition, yet being made up more of affability, not to apprehend faults, then curiosity to know them, was so far at present from being inquisitive after her adventures, that she onely with many Complements commended the excellency of her musick, leaving the mystery of her expressions to other interpretations: This with other variety of discourse employed the time, until the coolness of the evening invited them to take a more commodious entertainment at the Castle, according to the nature of the Ladies courtesie: As two rowes of even set Trees beyond those Woods, gave both a convenient and delightful passage to the dwelling, so did the habitation it self when they arrived, represent to the eye, a kinde of an old Castle, turned for the most part to the commodity of a new house, being moated at something a far distance for defence; which made it sufficiently strong against any surprize of straggling Souldiers, easily to be maintained by a large family: At the gate stood a competent number of waiters, expecting their Ladies return, as if time had instructed them concerning their duties, by a long continuance in their offices, in that manner resembling the ancient decorum of attendants; she quickly brought the Princess Cloria into a large Dining Room, furnished in a mixt way, between old and modern; where after they were refreshed a little by the orderly serving up of a small banquet; she also conducted her into her Bed-Chamber, being attended by two or three women to do her necessary service, in regard that Cloria's own train (by reason of their absence) wanted the conveniency; there she presently left her to her repose and retirement, where in that posture she remained, until by the Lady again she was invited to supper, that appeared to be served up with greater state and plenty, then riches or curiosity; since delicacies belong more to Courts and Cities, then to Charity and Hospitality; however the whole appeared so well ordered, that the Cooks had art enough to render the dishes good and wholesome, though neither exquisite nor affected; rather pretending to suffice nature then to compel it, (according to the hereditary custome of that family) more proper for heroical thoughts and noble actions: Nevertheless the Wine appeared to the taste both excellent and spiritful, being a creature moderately used, of most capacity to raise the fancy and assist expression: yet they did not remain long at supper, for Amarillia causing her Lute to be brought, conducted the Princess Cloria into the Park; where for the most part every night she took her musical recreation: Thus being engaged by this imployment, another part of the Wood entertained Creses and the Steward of the house, who walking together by a Brook side, Creses desiring to be satisfied concerning the condition of his Lady: The Gentleman after he had led him to a little seat, for both their better commodities, began a discourse in this manner. My Ladies, name said he, is Amarillia , something unfortunate I cannot deny in her beauty, although Daughter and Heir to a great Lord of the Countrey of Pamphylia , since her riches might have matcht her to the best marriage of these parts, if ambition had not too much prevailed upon her youth and disposition; but that meeting with a preposterous courtship, from one of a much higher degree, whose present pleasure belike was his principal end, hath cast her back into an intricate Labyrinth, mixed with a little disgrace, but more discontent: I do not doubt but you have heard of a certain Prince named Astratius , whose oppressions at the first by Philostros the Syrian Favourite, put him upon such uncertain and desperate enterprizes, that at last living in a manner wholly by his wits, or at leastwise so making his pretensions, when perhaps it was the appetites of his nature, he began to profess, couzening of others, as himself had been cheated, both out of his honour and estate, to be a tollerable decorum, though his practices were yet known to very few, much less suspected by young and innocent Amarillia . In this posture and with such thoughts (having been before called into this Countrey with a flying Army, toward the assistance of the King of Egypt ) he came to the Town where my Lady lived, and by that consequence, she became quickly the object of all his courtships, since her beauty best took his fancy, if his quality did not her respects; and to that purpose most violently solicited her to marriage which she entertained: 'Tis true, fame in some sort made him the Husband of another Wife, which notwithstanding he denyed with so many protestations, accompanied also by many probable reasons, that youth enflamed by ambition, either could not, or was not willing to be perswaded, that any thing but truth and sweetness of disposition, could be contained in a body, made up with so many perfections of nature and education. Though these Nuptials were privately consumated between themselves, yet afterwards seeming authority published the act, wherefore so lived together in the open face of the world, with all the splendour could be imagined: But the former pretended Wife of Astratius , coming after a while to the intelligence, (perhaps more displeased with the election, then enamoured of his person, since nothing is apter to enrage a womans spleen, then to have the competition of her worth, publickly decided to her disadvantage) with all violence could be exprest made a journey into the Kingdom of Syria ; where, however she had instructed her thoughts with sufficient matter for complaints, as being right heir of her Husbands Principality, and married in her youth before an open assembly, yet the Syrians State more joyfully received the occasion, not onely for that they might with better colour continue the possession of Astratius Lands, which they had purchased by the power and policy of dead Philostros , but also in regard of this new interest, they might have the likelier means to disturb him from the assistance of the Egyptians , in whose Countrey he then remained with competent Forces; so that presently dispatching a principal messenger to the Arch-Flamin of Delphos , they required justice from his authority, being a scandal as they pretended, that might prove of a most dangerous consequence, to the rights and title of all Asia , if persons of such quality should be permitted, thus to break the bands of their first Nuptials, and contract others onely to satisfie their own fancies; besides the contempt of his power (as they said) and the Temples sacred Laws prophaned, would be an occasion to fill the world with nothing but slaughters and contentions, when by this example the rights and successions concerning most governments and inheritances might come to be disputed: 'Tis true, the danger with the solicitation of the Syrian Ambassadour, quickly enflamed the thoughts of that jealous Court, with divers distrustful apprehensions: First, in regard Astratius act seemed to thwart the settled custome of the Temple, established for so long a time, under the unquestionable jurisdiction of the great City of Delphos: Next in that the precedent appeared to strike at the unsettlement of many other Princes in their Dominions, being subject to be overthrown in their prosperity, if other Nuptials should privately be contracted at the pleasure of every inconstant lover, that could not want pretences to change the object of their affections, when either profit or lust moved the question; so that instantly issuing out a rigid injunction concerning my Ladies marriage, both Astratius and Amarillia were commanded to be separate one from the other, until the full judgement of the cause, should be given solemnly, in that most high and sacred Court. But however this command appeared too peremptory to be disobeyed by what persons of quality soever, in regard a seeming curse depended upon the obstinacy; yet their loves being so intimately united between themselves, and as they thought confirmed by the general approbation of all the people, they notwithstanding forbore not their private meetings; which although perhaps it more engaged their affections, yet certainly it estranged them farther from the Gods favour, since obedience ought to be esteemed a higher act of piety, then the richest sacrifice could be offered, and a discreet temper more worth then the best of passions. These things I must confess I should not relate, but that they are already sufficiently known to the world; some years after these enterchanges of love passages, Astratius of a sudden, whether being over-tired with his pleasures, believing my Lady decayed in her beauty, or rather like a cunning politician, preferring his ends before his affection, notwithstanding he still made use of Amarillia's estate to supply his occasions, by degrees waved her company, until at last he gave her not the least visit, although they both continued in one Town; pretending nevertheless by his open professions, that his heart was wholly hers, however for the advantage of each, he was content in some sort to shew the contrary. Thus dissembling Astratius carried the out-side of his countenance, before the face of the multitude; however his covetous disposition in the interim, made him receive the whole benefit of my Ladies fortunes, not leaving her so much as a competency to maintain her own port; insomuch as she was constrained to retire within the same City to a most obscure habitation: You may be sure, that notwithstanding she was a little content, to be flattered by his reasons, yet was not any thing pleased at the occasion, having nothing else in a manner to build upon, then the bare promises depending on his inconstant resolutions; besides that all her estate was in his possession, which (as I told you) he mannaged sparing enough towards her particular; done so on purpose with an intention (as is now very well known) to render her the willinger to quit her claim to his person; whilst the great Ladies began already, not onely to question her place, but to despise her condition; envy for the most part inflaming at the glorious rayes of honour, seeking opportunity to depress whom it can by a seeming tyranny in the actors; which my poor Lady for a long time was forced to undergoe, with an unspeakable patience; her thoughts still depending upon hopes, that either her vertues or her cause, would at last procure her a great deal of pitty, if not a right consideration; at leastwise some relaxation of her intollerable miseries; nevertheless discontent continued her I may say in this posture, until Condorosus being engaged against his own King Orontes , called Astratius to his assistance, having bought him thereunto, both by money and perswasions. What the Transactions were in those parts, I suppose you may better know them then my self, since your young King Arethusius (as I have been informed) in those services was employed, although not personally to fight in Orontes quarrel, (as being esteemed something below his dignity) nevertheless to make some beneficial agreement with Astratius for the Syrian Interest, insomuch as presently he was obliged to leave the Countrey; however ungrateful Mazarius hath since so ill requited the favours of your young Prince, as himself is now forced to quit that Kingdom, the better to give way to those conditions of peace, which are made with Hercrombrotus the Lydian General; though Astratius be also extreamly exasperated, for being the principal occasion, why he left Syria , with his whole Army, remaining then in a posture, capable to have restored him again to his own possessions. As I would not have you to wonder, from what intelligence I come to have these informations, in regard the frequent exclamations of Condorosus (now remaining as you have heard in these parts) are sufficient to paint out the actions of Mazarius in the worst colours, so will I no further trouble your thoughts with impertinences, but concerning those passages that do belong to the body of the story I am to relate; and therefore shall be silent in the conditions, which were agreed upon between Orontes and Astratius , when the Rebellion was most hot in the Kingdom of Syria , procured by Condorosus opposition, though pretended chiefly to be, in regard of the unlimited Jurisdiction was cast upon the great Favourite, whereby the Princes of the blood were intollerably injured and supprest, both in their fortunes and power, to the apparent dishonour of all Syria , and scandal of other Nations; however no sooner was Astratius again returned into these Countreys of Pamphilia , but the marriage between him and Amarillia was dissolved, by a publick decree from the City of Delphos , issuing out (as 'twas thought) the easier, by reason of the then late agreement made in Syria ; for that Astratius being in the Town of Damascus he frequently visited his former wife, who for the present there remained. As you may very well imagine, this fatal judgement almost rent assunder the tender (and I hope innocent) heart of my Lady and Mistress, whose courage at the first hearing of the news, was not able to contend against her passions, (women being violent in all their actions) yet it was not long before the Gods, also shewed evident marks against Astratius disloyalties: For quarrels beginning to arise between him and Condorosus , not onely for precedency in dignity, but suspitions of friendship; this State doubting his correspondency with the Syrian Kingdom, in regard of the late accord he had made suddenly to acquit those wars, of a sudden caused him to be imprisoned, to the no small amazement of the whole Countrey; besides at the same time they also seized upon both his money and his Jewels, to the King of Egypts use: This unexpected Transaction is at present Amarillia's greatest happiness, since as all disgraces are encreased, by a necessity of dependency upon those who have occasioned them; so on the other side, it must needs be the best consolation to a suffering person, to be at last let loose from those obligations, which certainly renders a generous spirit, either something pleased, or altogether satisfied. 'Tis true, those passages have produced these effects in the general, that although the Favourite Mazarius hath often invaded the poor Countrey of Pamphilia , with most powerful Armies, yet the valorous spleen of Condorosus , hath given him many desperate defeats, not onely to the discontent, but the disgrace of the Syrian Nation: insomuch as they have been forced since to call in the Lydians to their assistance, both by sea and land, which is the occasion that Deorcas is now besieged with their joynt powers; the success at present being expected by all sorts of people, as a consequence whereupon depends, either the good or ill of this Principality. But again to return to my story of Astratius , there being not much behind towards the finishing thereof: After the imprisonment of his person (as I said) many Declarations were put forth, complaining of his fraud and want of fidelity to the King of Egypts service, notwithstanding his respectful usage and large pay; and for a further testimony of all his pretended impieties, a Command was sent not long after, to bring him well guarded to the Court at Memphis , there to answer those accusations that should be brought against him, according to the nature of his crimes; where for the present (as we hear) he remains, without much prosecution; the reason is (as it is thought) because of some overtures have been made by the great Arch-Flamin of Delphus , in reference to the general peace between the two Nations; upon which also depends the restoration and satisfaction of every other lesser Prince of Asia, Astratius being eminent of that number, whose oppression, as it is supposed, was one of the principal causes of the war at the first, in regard of his Countrey that was so violently taken away from his possession, by the power and practices of Philostros , for no other reason (as he alledgeth) but his being over faithfull to the Egyptian Family: Many believe also, that some reason of his restraint, was procured by the envy of Court Officers in these parts, who were often out-witted by his industry in money accounts and other designs, which their gravities were unwilling to suffer, without a requital answerable to his transgressions, their own ambitions being to have that Court to be held wise and circumspect, above other people in all their actions: Of the other side, for that his old Wife is lately dead at Damascus , my Lady Amarillia intends once again to renew her suit, concerning her contracted marriage; not onely to himself from whom she may doubt performance, in regard of the inconstancy of his nature, and subtilty of his practices, especially when she knows her beauty doth not now flourish, as it did in the spring of her years; but to the holy Flamin himself accompanied with the intercession of many other Princes, of whom she may expect some right and justice; and the rather, for that she hath yet children living by that Conjunction, whose innocency can neither be taxed, or their person despised, by what competent judgement soever; though in the interim is resolved as you see (according to the plenty of her patrimony) to maintain a noble decorum of hospitality, towards the entertainment of all manner of strangers, that by vertue may challenge a respect, or may advantage her pretentions; of which number I suppose your Lady to be eminent, having so near a relation to that gallant (though injured) Prince Arethusius , whose valour is not better understood in the world, then his company is acceptable to the poor subjects of the Countrey of Pamphilia . Truly, replied Creses , (taking no notice notwithstanding of this overture of Cloria's quality) as it appears to me by your relation, the greatest part of your difficulties are past, since the heavens have removed the obstacle most obstructive, by the death of Astratius former wife; so cannot now any thing hinder (acording to my apprehension) the Lady Amarillia , from compassing the height of her wished felicities: O Sir, said the steward, in that you are mistaken; for besides the inconstant fancies of Astratius , which I have already mentioned to be of no small concernment to our affairs, especially in one who onely governs his actions by his appetites, there is something else may prove more powerful, then all the tyes either sacred or moral, can be imagined to hinder our suit, which is, that the Syrian Nation being already in possession of his whole Countrey, will be loath a Subjects heir, belonging to the Dominion of Egypt , should so much as be in competition for that Government, lying so near the borders of the Syrian Monarchy, without themselves have at leastwise a particular interest in the present owner. But notwithstanding these reason may carry with them some kinde of despairs in my Ladies thoughts, (however womens desires for the most part are too violent, to be thwarted by ordinary objections; yet other hopes there are, in regard of the late and unexpected death of Artaxes great King of Armenia , whose natural Subject my Lord Astratius was; so that by reason of the vacancy of that Empire, all the Princes in a manner of Asia are summoned to make a new election, whereby the better to resist the strong power of the Persian Monarchy, whose spleen and ambition to have dominion in that Countrey of Armenia , hath not onely been formerly feared, but is now much doubted, considering the War he hath at the present made with other bordering States, begun by him both upon unjust and light occasions; wherefore in this expected assembly, there will not onely be means for all distressed persons of quality, to be heard and righted in their reasonable complaints, of which number my Lady Amarillia must needs be esteemed worthy of a favourable audience, but also Astratius himself will be released out of prison, whereby to be assistant in that High Court of Honour and Dignity; before which Tribunal it may be supposed, he will not wave those contracts, that have passed between him and my innocent Lady, since such testimonies of his falshood must appear, that of necessity shall brand him with marks of eternal shame and infamy: With these words the Steward rose from his seat, telling Creses , that as he had troubled him with a story belonging to his Ladies saddest posture, so now if he pleased, they would go to finde her out, whereby they might behold her in a more delightful temper, since her Lute and she (being esteemed relatives) could not but joyn, in making up some harmony to their contents, which exercise entertained them until their return to the Castle. However Creses remained no longer in that commodious habitation then the night following, for the next morning (receiving Cloria's commands) he took his leave, thrust on by his own violent desires, to enquire out the fortunes of Prince Arethusius , besieged (as 'twas reported) within the strong walls of Deorcas ; though first he repaired to the Town, where the evening before, the Princess train were designed to lodge, whereby to dispatch some of her people to her further service, she having already made known her own person to the Lady, in whose noble extraction and gentle disposition Cloria began to put an absolute confidence, both for her entertainment and security: But scarce had Creses travelled three dayes journey, in prosecution of his designs, but arriving at a little Village about noon, he encountered with a brave Troop of Horse, newly come as it was said by the inhabitants, from near about Deorcas , where, as it should seem they had been for some time quartered, to wait and attend upon the adventures and actions of the Siege; Creses was more then glad at this encounter, hoping to hear some news belonging to Prince Arethusius fortunes; wherefore that night singling out one of the Officers, after having informed him who he was, as also of his near relations to the young King of Myssia , desired him if his leasure would permit, or the trouble might not appear too great a favour upon so small acquaintance, to be instructed in what appertained to all the Wars that year that had hapned in the Countrey of Pamphylia ; whereupon the well bred Souldier not making any scruple, with much courtesie and little ceremony began in this manner. Sir, said he, in respect to your person, as being one of that quality about your Prince, that may merit the knowledge of our greatest affairs, in having dependency not onely upon his actions, but also an interest in his friends, whom it doth not a little concern, I shall at this time dispence a little with the rules of my own command, whereby the better to give you particular satisfaction; the rather since we know our general Lord the King of Egypt , tenders in some sort your Masters Right, as his own Countreys good: Be pleased to know therefore, that no sooner was Mazarius the beginning of this Summer, with the whole Syrian Army, fallen into the very heart of our distressed Dominions, but the Lydian General Hercrombrotus (according to some accord made between them) appointed also his Admiral at Sea, with a competent number of Ships, to lie before the Haven Town of Deorcas , whilst in the mean time the Favourite made his circular Trenches about the whole City, unless it were where the water gave them a necessary impediment; insomuch as a very few dayes had entirely shut up the place, from all possibility of relief, notwithstanding some brave sallies had been performed from within, whereby to hinder their approaches, which not onely brought between the Souldiers many encounters of divers natures, but several slaughters were made of the best men of valour of either side. These transactions I say, imployed both Armies for some weeks; Prince Arethusius and Condorosus doing wonders in the interim within the Town, as we of the other side (with our flying Troops) endeavoured to give the Syrian guards in their Trenches, what impediment we could; but that which proved most remarkable was, the burning of a certain work of timber, that the Lydian Forces had erected, whereby in the Haven, the better to secure their Fleet, from the violence of storms and tempests, having on the banks placed a mount, from whence they were accustomed to discharge against the Town, many great stones, by the help of a certain great Engine, industriously made for that purpose; in which action your brave King Arethusius would needs be imployed, getting in the service a small wound in his thigh: 'Tis true it might be thought some derogation from his dignity, to be thus active in a common Siege; but such were the inflammations of his courage against the Lydian people, hired by the Syrian Favourite in this contention, that no perswasions could work upon his nature, or rather hinder his spleen, since he would needs engage himself in these hazzards, onely fit for the industry of persons of meaner quality; or at the best, of not so much concernment. Thus did we hold our enemies play, as they gave us imployment, whilst King Orontes in the interim remained for his better safety, in a strong Town upon the borders of his own Countrey; whither as we have been since informed, came an Ambassador from Hercrombrotus , not onely to congratulate his enterprises and successes, within the hereditary Territories of Pamphylia , belonging to the great Monarch of Egypt , but also to strengthen friendships and demand conditions, in regard of these new attempts upon the City of Deorcas , as 'twas pretended, carried on the better, by reason of the Lydian Forces; also it was desired, to have the Haven delivered into their possession, when it should be taken, with all the particular Dominions thereunto belonging; not onely the likelier to fortifie the security agreed upon, but to increase the commodity of both Nations, since the people of Lydia were more addicted to trading, then the Subjects of Syria: However some complements were used by Orontes , to content the peremptory messenger, yet many arguments were discoursed to hinder the intention; for that the honour of the Kingdom of Syria , came publickly in question, before such Commissioners as were appointed to treat of that weighty business; but Mazarius (whose secret transactions, and private concernments, were scarce known to any, but to his own thoughts) not onely presently put off all disputes belonging to that demand, but promised after the Town was rendred, to send a particular messenger of quality to the great City of Sardis , whereby Hercrombrotus and his Councel, might receive full satisfaction; in the interim pretending, 'twas no policy of State, to disturb businesses in their prosecution, by unnecessary contentions, when the least interruption, might perhaps deprive both parties of the power, seeing the Souldiers within those fortifications, appeared to be most obstinate in their defence. As the Ambassadour was forced to be content with these reasons, so did not the Court seem to contradict Mazarius will, knowing his decrees, were judgements resembling the Persian Laws, not to be opposed by inferiour interests; scarce at any time by the Kings own youthful appetites, when most enflamed, either by instigation or ambition; so that things rested in this posture, until suspicion arising in the Town, concerning their unhappy fates, if being subdued they should come under the Lydian Government; more hateful to the thoughts of Arethusius then destructive to the Religion of the place, resolved presently with one accord, to a general salley upon the enemy, lying more securely as they hoped, within the coverture of their proper works, in regard that not long before they had made some kinde of semblance of parley with the Syrian General, about their rendring upon honourable conditions, though King Arethusius and Prince Condorosus seemed to be most involved in the interest; however differing much in their injuries, for as the first was kept from the possessions of his lawful Kingdoms, by the violent oppressions of his natural Subjects, who should have afforded him, either more justice or less disobedience; so the other was denyed entrance into his proper Countrey onely by his exasperated enemies, in regard of his own pretended rebellions; being notwithstanding alike concerned in the taking of the Town, that of necessity as they knew, would confirm both their persons to a most horrid captivity, not to be indured, either by their qualities or their courages; wherefore determined with desperate spirits, though small hopes, rather then be taken, to make their way through the very heart of the Syrian Army; so that presently giving intelligence to our Forces, (that lay at some distance) of their intended design, in the dead of the night putting it in execution with secresie, their fortunes prevailing against their doubts, as their resolution conquered the danger, they both after much slaughter, arrived safe in our Camp, from their prosecutours power. 'Tis true, the Town was gallantly defended after this escape for some season, but the Governour making a desperate salley, finding no other way probably for its continuance, became himself so dangerously wounded in the service, that within a very few dayes he ended his life; insomuch as the inhabitants were forced by reason of this accident, not onely to admit of a farther treaty, but to yield upon certain conditions; which was to render the Fort up into the hands of the Syrian Commander: Nevertheless this success occasioned another dispute of a contrary nature; for the Lydian Admiral pretending a bargain made with Mazarius , to enjoy the first-fruits of that years conquest, claimed a ratification of the agreement, by being instantly put into possession of this very place, which notwithstanding was much controverted in the Councels, both of the Court and Camp, until the Favourite (pretending to send his Nephew Manchinus , into the Countrey of Lydia , to compose all businesses with Hercrombrotus ) for the present seemed to quiet every difference. To make a particular relation of those imployments, that visibly appeared to most but meer complements, would be perhaps as tedious for you to hear, as difficult for me to relate, since Mazarius hath been still accustomed, to shadow over his intended designs, with false covertures of contrary resemblances; onely this was certain upon his coming back, the effect demonstrated the combination; but whether honourable or no, I shall leave you to judge; for no sooner was this trusty messenger returned from Sardis to the Syrian Court, but the King himself gave instant order, to have the Town forthwith delivered over to the Lydian power, where now it remains, to the absolute discontent of the whole Countrey, if not also to the amazed scandal of other Nations, when they shall be fully advertised of these proceedings; besides the Gods appear something to be anger'd at the action, in that Orontes presently fell sick of a most pestilent Feaver, not being yet known whether he will recover, or end his dayes in so sad a period, which at this time shall also finish my discourse; hoping that better fortunes may hereafter attend our desires, not onely for the future prosperity of the Egyptian Monarchy, but towards the honour and glory of the Delphine Religion. Although Creses with many Complements, appeared to condole the unhappy fate of Deorcas , to be delivered into the absolute Jurisdiction of Hercrombrotus , besides the impoverishing of the fertile Countrey of Pamphilia , having scarce any other Haven Town under that Dominion, either for access or transportation, yet could he not inwardly, but be excessive glad, of the courageous escape of Prince Arethusius , his most honoured and excellent Master; so that after they had spent some other few discourses upon the continued subject, Creses further desired the Officer, that since he had been pleased to give him these informations, not onely concerning the safety of his Prince, but a full advertisement of all that had passed in that Campaniet, he would also encrease his obligation more in directing him a way, how he might securely get to the Kings presence, having affairs, as he said, nearly belonging to his person, which he was speedily to impart, since he knew the common road to be dangerous enough, in regard of straggling Souldiers with other impediments of the same nature: The Commander presently made this reply, that as it was unpossible for him to pass to the place of his residence, without a very strong Convoy; so if his occasions would permit him but to stay for a week or two, himself with his whole Troop were to return again into those parts; insomuch as with the venture of his life, he would become his faithful security; and in the mean time if he pleased, he should command an equal share in his own quarters, if the commodity were in any kinde worth the acceptance: As Creses entertained this courtesie with a civil gratitude, answerable to his breeding, and the humanity of his disposition, so with some impatience did he attend the limited time for the Captains remove. At the day appointed ( Creses in the interim furnishing himself with Horse and Armour) became also a Trooper of that Company, however for his more delightful conversation he chose the same Commander, for his onely associate in the night season, and in that manner marched together towards the place of their Rendezvouz, with no small satisfaction; but scarce were they arrived within a dayes journey of their designed station, but they were suddenly encountred by a party of the enemy, as well Lydians as Syrians , that seemed to exceed them in number, if not in warlike provision: Though this accident a little perplexed their thoughts, in regard they expected no interruption, yet did it no way lessen their courages, being alwayes enflamed (as it should seem) to fight when the occasion should be offered. Wherefore after the Captain had by a short speech animated his Souldiers, to contend with valour, for the good of their Countrey, and the honour of their Religion, since most of their oppressours appeared to be of a contrary faith, they fell on with fury enough, until many brave men of each side, were forced unwillingly to measure their lengths upon the bare ground, bespotted with their own blood, as a faithfull sacrifice offered to their cause and party: This rough contention I may say, lasted for almost a quarter of an hour, with such seeming equality in dispute, that hardly could it be imagined on which side the victory would incline: But Creses according to his wonted practice, heated by action, and as it were burning with spight, performed things more of wonder then of ordinary fortitude, until having received many desperate wounds in his body, he was constrained to quit his horse, whilst in the interim he was surrounded by some of his own company for his better security, though himself also with his shield defended his person the best he could, notwithstanding the contrary party encreased by a new supply, comming undiscovered from a shady wood, upon a brow of a hill not far distant, which for a while something daunted their hopes to prevail, however no way lessened their wills to overcome; since they were resolved, if they could not conquer in probability, to sell their lives at the highest rate honour should require; and although the disadvantage rendred them desperate in effect, yet reason made them circumspect in performance, at leastwise for their Countreys benefit, if not towards their own preservation: But the Gods as it should seem, either pittying their persons, or favouring their innocency, by chance in a Town not far off there lodged another Troop belonging to the Pamphilian Dominion, who having some intelligence of this engagement, by certain Boors labouring in the fields, they quickly upon notice given, made haste to their rescue: The conflict then began a new in a vigour, though with more equality by number, which produced many other considerable slaughters, until the Clowns also of the place, taking up Arms towards their assistance, so over-powered the rest of the Syrian party, that in a short time they were forced to take their flight, whilst Creses and the Captain (being both wounded) were presently conducted, to the next convenient habitation for their cure and recovery. 'Tis true, the Egyptian Officer kept not long his bed by reason of his wounds received, but Creses whose hurts were of a more dangerous nature, not onely a good while underwent that inconveniency, but at last fell into a most violent Feaver, that in a manner put every body out of all thoughts of his preservation; so that the Priest of the place (a man excellent both for his learning and life) conceiving it in some sort his duty, notwithstanding he appeared to be of a contrary Religion, to contribute his best help in Creses necessity; so that one day coming into his chamber, and finding the room emptied by chance from all other company, seriously entred upon this discourse with him. Sir, said he, I make no doubt, but that you now finde that all temporary pleasures are vanities in nature, since you must suddenly leave their enjoyments, without any fruit of what is past; however it may be some question, what you believe concerning things to come: To this purpose, I pray you consider in the first place this great and stupendious universe, where the whole appears so strange to the apprehension, that the least particle cannot be perceived by what knowledge soever, how it encreaseth or diminisheth, yet judge we must that something was the authour of the work, in that not any thing comes without a maker, since by all Philosophy corruptions alone produce, and productions onely corrupt; by the same power, as one womb bringeth forth several natures, distinct in form, colour, and taste, though with a kinde of an orderly motion; this plainly shews a divine providence, which providence cannot but direct an use, and this use as it ought to be good in the intention, so must this good tend onely to eternity, since all defections are meerly unperfect, and so consequently not good; wherefore this being granted, we must look for the object of this Creation and eternal intention: Surely this object can be no other then mans everlasting subsistance, he being the noblest of creatures, having onely understanding and reason to distinguish granted him, whereby he is rendred capable to know good and evil; and the good necessarily depends upon obedience, towards that excellency that gave first that benefit and prerogative, and so consequently to be informed of his pleasure. To this purpose, for the more easie knowing of his will, he hath prescribed our practice an intelligible law, communicated to our apprehensions by clear and undoubted revelations, ascertain'd by faithful Traditions, from time to time as occasion was offered; however if any objections should be raised, how a certainty might be understood amongst so many diversities of opinions, I shall onely answer by this argument or instruction; either ancient Records must shew the practice, or present miracles perswade the belief; and these being found plain and convincing, it were not onely an impiety, but a madness, to contradict the effects: Wherefore if there be any other place besides the Temple of Delphos , that can claim these properties, let it be shewed for confutation, which no doubt the enemies thereof would have done before this, if they could have procured the means, when as so many Rebels to that sacred Tribunal, have been often challenged to that purpose; so that there being one and but one to be observed, as the commanded law of the eternal Maker prescribed to the world, why should any person be of another belief, then what those Records since the very beginning have from age to age taught and shewed? Wherefore your Lydian Religion, appearing to be contrary to these principles, you have more then cause to fear, the near approach of the eternal determination of this divine power, if you regulate not now your thoughts before your death to the conformity that is necessary for your future security; for that the Gods are no way to be pleased, either by diversity of opinions, or obstinacy in disobedience, especially when they have given Infallible Rules for our instruction: This being delivered, the Priest rested silent, as if he expected some answer from his desired penitent, or by the observation of his countenance, a little to conjecture of his inward thoughts, towards the alteration of his minde. But Creses being at present fitter for apprehension then expression, made him no reply at all; so that at the same instant coming company into the chamber, they were constrained to break off the farther intention of other discourse; onely Creses desired the Priest to visit him again two or three dayes hence: However that night Creses began more seriously to consider, those reasons the Religious Person had uttered for his satisfaction, though more especially this one argument of his delivered; that no other place besides the Temple of Delphos , could produce Records infallible certain concerning the Fundamental Laws given first, for all mankinde to reverence and obey, upon which depended every thing (as he supposed) necessary to be observed, towards the eternal end mentioned: With these imaginations, he fell by degrees into a kinde of a quiet slumber, wherein he continued so long a time, until his fancy at last figured to his thoughts the appearance before his eyes, of Apollo and the Goddess Vesta , shining with excessive rayes of Glory; withall telling him, that unless he suddenly changed his erroneous belief, by embracing the right Worship of the Heavens, according to the Temple of Delphos practice, shewed plainly by the Priest, those eternal torments prepared for the breakers of the omnipotent Law, would undoubtedly fall to his share for his contempt: As this vision quickly wakened him with no small terrour to his conscience, so upon the next visit of the Father, he resolved to be converted to his opinions; however again when he appeared for that purpose, Creses thoughts anew began to wayer, as too much fearing belike what inconveniency his alteration in religion, might bring to the affairs of absent Arethusius , whose concernment his heart tendred abundantly. The grave Father finding the principal cause of his backwardness, to be in regard of Arethusius concernments, after a while furnished him with this modern story, as a greater incouragement to his resolutions, by the hopeful success of those professing the belief of Delphos . You cannot, said he, but have been already informed of the memorable Wars, hapning not many years ago between Thyargos the brave King of Scythia , and Artaxes the good King of Armenia , as 'twas known, chiefly procured by reason of contentions, arising from differences in points of Religion; since many Princes of the Armenian Subjects, took part with the Scythian interest, as doubting the extraordinary piety of Artaxes , would compel them to part with such Lands their Ancestors had usurped from the Temples Rites. This invasion you must believe, brought the King of Armenia into so low a condition, that oftentimes (with some tears in his eyes) he offered to lay down his own dignity, doubting as he said, the Gods did not favour his personal proceedings, by reason of the increase of his enemies Forces, fortified with the endeavours of multitudes of his rebellious Subjects, that feared much to continue under his Religious jurisdiction: However the Councel of the Court (joyning with some Ambassadours of Forreign Princes then present) not onely encouraged Artaxes still to wear the Diadem (as they said) so lawfully cast upon him by a just right of election, but ordered the whole Army instantly to give Thyargos Battle, leaving the trial and issue, to the onely dispose and regulation of the immortal Gods, for whose cause they seemed to contend. 'Tis true, that however King Thyargos upon the first charge was slaughtered by an unknown accident, yet those Commanders of his party, continued still the contention with so much fury, that scarce could the dark night distinguish the Victory of the Armenian side: Nevertheless this indifferency in the Battle procured Artaxes some countenance; however the Scythian Souldiers settled more firmly their quarters in the Countrey, as it should seem both Armies having neither power nor will, more to contend for that years service. Although this took away the determinable hazzard to either party, yet the boors every where were constrained to feel the oppression, since no place for a long time but walled Towns, could defend any mans goods or person. In this posture I may say Armenia remained some years space, Artaxes rather gaining ground then losing advantage, in that many Princes of the Countrey returned to his assistance; notwithstanding the great Philostros all he could assisted the Scythian party, until at last perhaps the Gods pittying the miseries, if not favouring the posterity of the people, procured a sudden peace to be agreed between the Syrians, Armenians , and Scythians , contrary to the thoughts of most, since the continued War had rendred the practice hereditary in opinion. As this joyful intelligence presaged happiness to all sorts of conditions, so were the Articles of friendship quickly signed, by those interessed in the composition of this seeming eternal quarrel, wherein the Syrians were to have a good proportion of Armenia for their quiet, as the Scythians most huge summes of monies to forego their interest; besides those Princes and Subjects which profest the Herezian Religion, were to pass free and undisturbed in their profession: But as soon as the Arch-Flamin of Delphos , and our great Monarch of Egypt , heard of this intention; they both endeavoured with excessive violence to hinder the conclusion: The first pretending an injury done to his prerogative, to have Divine matters handled and determined without his knowledge, being as 'twas said, prejudicial to the Temples priviledges: The other more furious in point of interest, as much fearing the Syrian advantage in these Countreys, presently married the young Daughter of Artaxes , whereby to keep him (if possible) from going forwards with his former bargain; which (resolution notwithstanding the agreement made) protracted a long time the publication of Articles; until at last the Syrians and Scythians , again beginning to fall upon Armenia in a most hostile manner (the Souldiers every where sufficiently glad of the occasion, since their Officers were not satisfied with their rewards, no more then their Prince with the intention) Artaxes was forced to give way to the final conclusion, against the earnest opposition of his two mighty friends, whose concernments his heart rather favoured, then his power could assist; in regard the people on every side cryed out most violently for peace. As this ratification within some few moneths, disposed things towards the freeing the Countrey, not onely from all Garrisons but marching Troopers; so did the Commanders of the Scythian Army, return with more glory then content, to the Court of their young Queen Philogenia , whose practice in the Wars by plundering, gave them as they thought a better subsistance, then could the Northern Clymate at their own homes. Here the Priest of a sudden broke off his discourse, perceiving Creses a little tired by reason of his distempers; however calling some of his assistants into the chamber (though he presently took his leave) yet promised him upon the next visit, to give him a further account, concerning those passages he was to relate: Within a day or two the religious man (finding a new opportunity, Creses also appearing more chearful then formerly, both in his words and countenance, though still lying in his bed) he entred again in this manner upon his old relation. As I told you the other day, said he, the Commanders of the Army, being again returned into their own Countrey of Scythia , finding perhaps that their rewards answered not their expectation, or their imployments suited with their dispositions, seeing the too much decorum of the Court, and the youthful majesty of the Queen that tended rather to respectful distances, then to Souldiers preferments, began earnestly to solicit their Sovereign to marry; as they alledged, thereby to settle a convenient posterity for the Kingdoms safety, with more lustre to the Military profession; from whence they said, both her Father and her self had received their greatest honour: Besides for a testimony of their intended limitation, concerning her choice, they prescribed her a Prince of her own kindred named Dogalphus , who for some years past in Armenia had been their highest General: But the young Queen Philogenia , (whether or no in her thoughts she disdained the person of her own Subject, or whether her resolutions, had in some sort miraculously been enflamed by divine inspirations) of a sudden not onely quitted her Kingdom to her Cousins possession, but speedily made a journey to the City of Delphos , where leaving the errours of the Heresian opinions, which until then she had openly professed, absolutely became a subject of the Arch-Flamins directions; as I may say, changing all her temporal enjoyments, to purchase onely a possibility of that happy eternity, which my desires have (with a great deal more reason) endeavoured to perswade you unto at the present; since as her condition certainly then was glorious, so yours appears something desperate at this instant. At these words Creses began to shed many tears; but whether at the consideration of his own condition, or apprehension of Philogenia's vertues, must rest a question: for that the Priest going on still with his story, by degrees he returned to his wonted temper. The Souldiers, said he, having gained their young Commander, to become their Crowned King, not onely triumphed exceedingly in the purchase, but quickly put his thoughts on fire to actions of War; which being presently resolved upon in his Councel, passion prevailing, and justice not regarded; the next question was, who should be the object of that troublesome design? since the late agreement with the King of Armenia would not dilectly permit so great a falshood to be executed, tending to the dishonour of all other Princes; however oblickly they threatned also his estate in intention: so that first making a strict combination with Hercrombretus your Lydian General (whose interest most prospered in unnatural combustions) and also flattering Mazarius the Syrian Favourite into the party, by reason of his suspicion concerning the Egyptian family, of a sudden invaded the Territories of Trapasus , whose King notwithstanding, might have challenged a better right to the Scythian Territory, involving him in this manner with a double injury; and the rather for at that very time, he was dangerously imployed in many perplexed contentions with another Northern Prince, equal to Dogalphus both in power and spight. This unexpected surprize, quickly rendred the whole Countrey a most miserable object of misfortune, since the King in a short space, was not onely constrained to forsake his own Dominions, but Towns were ransacked, and people destroyed, as if the total ruine of the world had been intended; and so continued until both the King of Armenia , and the other mentioned Scythian Prince, either pittying those calamities, or fearing the approaching danger, joyned in combination both together to resist the furiousness of that torrent, pretending that such proceedings at last might also work them out of their own Jurisdiction: This conjuncture after some moneths engagement of either side, gave the King of Trapasus a new footing in his almost lost Countrey, insomuch as Dogalphus calling in a young warlike Prince also to his assistance, being of the same belief as himself concerning the Worship of the Gods, against the Rites and Ceremonies of the Temple of Delphos , began again in that manner to encrease his Forces, towards more hazzardable adventures then formerly: However Dogalphus after many various conflicts and desperate battles, being over-powered as it should seem by his double opposers, returned with his Army into another Dominion composed most of Islands, that borders if not commands the Uxime Sea; intending in that enterprize wholly to be possessed of many commodious Havens, whereby to become rich and mighty in Navigation, since his Land designs prospered not according to his desires and expectation: Nevertheless he met in like manner there with such a resistance, (although it is alledged he broke some accord with that King) that retained him in those Wars, until his own sudden death put a period both to his passions and his Conquests: Here the Priest again thought it time to leave Creses , to another convenient rest, promising notwithstanding the next day to make a full end of his intended relation; and so by consequence to come to those periods, whereby the better to facilitate his conversion, in that he judged rather worldly interest hindred his resolutions, then that his understanding wanted convincing arguments, to perswade his belief: Wherefore not willing in the extremity of his sickness, either to over-charge his memory, or tire his spirits, which was the occasion that so often he abruptly broke off his discourse, and quitted his company. The day after the Priest again fell upon the continuation of his discourse in this manner: As I told you yesterday, said he, these mentioned Princes formerly a long time remained embroiled in their contentions; sometimes one flying off, and another comming on, insomuch as in the judgements of most people it was a hard matter to conjecture, either what they meant, or how they would proceed: But in the interim whilst this war was acting, it hath pleased the Gods, by something an unexpected (if not a sudden) death to take Artaxes great King of Armenia out of this troublesome world, though perhaps intending him a benefit to ease his cares, since his approved piety in all opinions, deserved the Heavens best mercy, leaving the Catastrophe of all settlements to younger thoughts; which by fate hath happened to his morning son, not then eighteen years of age, governed by his many friends and best Councellours: For presently this young Prince putting in for the Empire by their advice, various enemies endeavoured to oppose the design; some saying he was too young for his office; others not indifferent enough for their peace; that dignity having remained already too long entailed in one house; neither wanted there some of the Heresian belief, who aimed at other persons more favourable, to those of their Religion and Worship; which not onely put off his present election, but gave a full opportunity, for both the Syrians and the Egyptians , to come in for their particular interest: As these suspitions and pretentions, were sufficient causes for obstacles and protractions, so was his non age a plain hinderance in matter of Law, according to the first Armenian Constitution: Notwithstanding the Arch- Flamin of Delphos had sent a dispensation for their proceedings to his election, fearing in the vacancy of the Government, the great Emperour of Persia might prejudice very much the affairs of those Territories, being known alwayes to have been a dangerous enemy to the glory and security of Armenia: To this purpose also the friends of Artaxes offered to have discreet persons nominated, that should alwayes be near his actions, whereby to regulate his youth upon all convenient occasions, that no injury should come; either to his Government or particular: But as the continued spleen of the two mighty Kings, was for the most part a Rub to all other affairs, so in this it became more predominant, insomuch as the election was absolutely determined not to be proceeded upon, until a riper age of the Prince gave them both warrant and conveniency, for their new King to be chosen, according to the ancient decorum of the State belonging to such sacred and extraordinary Ceremonies. Also it was pretended in that space of time all persons of quality had liberty to work out their own advantages and Rights, either by private interest, or publick expostulations, since Armenia (with the neighbouring Princes and their Dominions) seemed to become one elevated Theatre of the world, filled with nothing but confusion and complaints, as if the Gods had determined to set up a Tribunall, whereby to judge man, in point of enmity, concerning onely temporary possessions of the earth: 'Tis true, that in the interim of this prefixed time, many Ambassadours of all Nations (although they feasted one another with much Ceremony) did not forbear to offer up in writing, not onely their demands but exasperations, which a Court ordained for that purpose was appointed to receive, though not to determine; since such Jurisdiction alone was reserved for the Judgement of seven Royal Magistrates of Armenia , unto whom also belonged the choice of the great and supream Prince of that Empire. But when the day came for this famous and great election, ( Artaxes being now of full age) first Orontes by his Ministers of State exhibited to the Assembly, the consideration of his Rights by a composition, some time ago made with all the Princes of Armenia , not onely to have in quiet possession the Territories granted him in that Kingdom, when he withdrew his whole Army out of their Dominions, but also that no succour should be sent to the King of Egypt , whereby to strengthen him in the Wars against the Syrians proceedings; however of the other side the King of Egypt pretended that such restrictions were neither honourable nor just, whereby to tye up the will and power of a free Monarch, since the Laws of Nations onely were sufficient, to regulate and ascertain any composition made with predecessors of Dominions and Governments; besides the judgement of the Princes of Armenia , as they conceived, could and ought best to determine such differences in a great and general Councel assembled for that purpose; especially when all parties concerned were in those particulars become the meer Subjects of the Empire, and therefore not to be tried or justified by any other Tribunals; wherefore prayed notwithstanding what opposition soever, the election should speedily go on without interruption, according to the Laws and nature of the first institution, being the chief Bulwark against the Persian Invasion, that at present seemed to threaten all their disquiets. Neither wanted there some Princes and free Towns that required a more particular confirmation and security concerning the priviledges, belonging to those of the Heresian Religion, since lately as they alledged, they had received prejudice, both in their persons and fortunes, contrary to justice and former Charters; with a thousand other various complaints of sundry natures, too tedious at present to be related; amongst which number also was prosecuted violently; the releasement from prison of Prince Astratius , a person who in the beginning suffered, by the oppression of great Philostros , Favourite to King Orsames ; and now remains confined in Egypt for many pretended crimes, by him committed in this particular Countrey of Pamphilia , who being esteemed a certain Member of the Empire of Armenia , his Cause ought, as his friends desired, to be in dispute at that high and famous Assembly. Thus I must tell you stood businesses a long time in a most confused disturbance; some while one party prevailing in the opinions of the people, and at other seasons the contrary faction got the better by most voyces, as either they could procure favour or interest; until at last the great assembly finding these protractions, did but multiply differences and prejudice the whole frame of the Government, resolved not onely to put off all inferiour suits to more time and other judges, but also to fall presently upon the election of the future Emperour; fearing else the delay might give encouragement to the mighty King of Persia , as well to invade the Territories, as to over-press more powerfully another worthy Commonwealth, with which he had for many years contended in War, by a most exasperated violence. To this purpose an expedient was thought upon to content probably all persons, and that was before the Crowning of Artaxes Emperour, to make him subscribe a writing, not to assist any Prince being no Subject born of his own Dominions, without the general consent of all his Kingdom; as also to confirm and ratifie those compositions, that had been made with his Father, whereby the peace and welfare of Armenia had been formerly procured. 'Tis true, though this agreement contented most, yet the Syrian Ambassadours refused to be present at the Ceremony; however the stately triumphs went on in a most glorious manner; for young Artaxes being placed in a golden Chariot, was drawn through the acclamations of the multitude to the principal Temple of the City, where having first offered a noble sacrifice to the Gods, and distributed large benevolences to the common sort of Subjects, at last before the high Altar he received (by the hands of the chief Flamin ) the Royal and ancient Diadem of Armenia ; in the interim nothing sounding but sweet harmonies and warlike instruments, to shew there was intended by this happy inauguration, to unite all differences both of Peace and War; since for the present almost all transactions seemed to be at a stand, which had a reference also to that desired agreement, between Orontes and the King of Egypt: so that after Artaxes had the homage of all the Princes and Nobility of the Countrey, every one performing his hereditary office, according to his place and command; and many dayes ceremonies and entertainments were finished, Artaxes with his proper train onely, returned to his own Court; nevertheless he received in the way, such affections and honours as every Town and Province, had prepared towards his reception. Artaxes being in this manner arrived at his own Court, he became quickly saluted by many Ambassadours, almost from every Prince and Commonwealth in Asia: Some to congratulate his happy succession to the Royal Crown of Armenia , notwithstanding all the oppositions to the contrary; others more particular treated onely of their friendships and affairs, concerning the differences yet remaining; amongst the rest, a trusty messenger from Osiris King of Egypt came to desire a speedy aid, to be imployed in the Countreys of Pamphylia , (as it was pretended) for that Hercrombrotus having made a league with the Syrian Forces, had not onely invaded the Territories, but was really possessed of a strong Fort belonging to Deorcas , by the willing consent of Mazarius , in regard of which the true Worship of the Gods, was in great danger to be lost, since the Lydians were known to be exasperated enemies to such rites. As this proposition of Egypt , became a difficult question in the Councel to be determined, in regard of that conditional Article of Artaxes , being he was no way to disturb the Empires peace, by giving any assistance to Forreign States, without the full consent of all the Princes of Armenia , so after many disputations between those persons intrusted for his affairs, at last it was resolved, that however Artaxes should not countenance the King of Egypt in his War against Orontes ; yet he might lawfully send Souldiers to defend Pamphylia against Hercrombrotus , provided that dominion were given by Osiris , to some third person of no Egyptian descent; besides the messenger offered at the present, his master should really perform this intimation, if in the interim the general Peace were not concluded, answerable to the desires of the great Arch-Flamin , with all the other Asian Princes. With this determination every man seemed so well satisfied, that as one of Artaxes family was nominated, to be supreme Lord and Governour of those parts, so did the Ambassadour himself within a few dayes take his leave: The time afterward was spent, in nothing but feasts, sports, and turnaments, compliable with the youthful disposition of the new Emperour. But now, Sir, the better to conclude my discourse for your advantage, as most Princes of the Delphine belief, have resolved to assist Arethusius your Lord and Master, in his just rights against Hercrombrotus , if once this great attonement were made between Osiris and Orontes , which otherwise procures them so many imployments, both at home and abroad, that it is yet unpossible to spare any considerable Forces for the purpose; so have I lately received intelligence from a very good hand, that the King of Syria being newly recovered from a most dangerous and malignant Feaver, that for some time put his whole Court from any hope of his subsistance, either out of his own inclination, or by the perswasion of those Flamins about his person, hath made an entire vow to the immortal Gods, that he would industriously imploy all his thoughts and endeavours, to set an end to those Wars and Contentions between himself and his near Kinsman the King of Egypt , which for so many years have disturbed the whole frame of Government in this part of the world, where nothing hath been seen but blood, slaughters, and devastation, to the dishonour of the Heavens and the destruction of mankinde; so that your judgement may easily conjecture, what disadvantage you can possible undergo, by changing your Religion at the present, when as it is most improbable, your young King can ever come again to the quiet possession of his Countrey, but by the power and force of those Princes, which are wholly given to observe the rules and customs of the Temple of Delphos . The Priest with these words rested silent, in the interim giving Creses thoughts some respite to consider, as hoping his discourse would produce good effects, towards his absolute and speedy conversion; however he made him no reply at all, onely many tears in his eyes might easily be perceived, that shewed some difficulties remained yet in his breast undiscovered, being engendred perhaps between fear, hope, and doubt: Nevertheless after a while, he told him, that as for the present, he found his spirits something tired, so could he wish again to have his company the next day, when perchance he might be found more settled in his determination; which at the instant the weakness of his constitution or his distempers, could not by any means permit. 'Tis true, the discreet civilities of the Priest (thought this answer was sufficient, to make him quit the room for the present) resolved notwithstanding to perform his desires, thinking any pains he should take, would largely be requited with the purchase of the whole, if by any means he could procure the reducing of so excellent a soul to the Gods service. When the Priest was parted the chamber, Creses entred quickly upon these considerations; that if he should now change his Religion to another form, the world would not onely look upon his actions with wonder and amazement, but he should endanger the favour, that formerly he had with his Prince; since those about his person, could not but detract from all his services and endeavours, as if his designs were as well altered, as his opinions changed; envy biting more securely, when causes are given for suspicions; besides his fancy played very much upon this doubt, that as Arethusius never seemed outwardly to relish Parismenus affections, after publickly he quitted the Lydian interest, to worship the Temple of Delphos ; so could he not but apprehend his nature to be fearful enough, in giving countenance to any of his followers, that in matters of ceremony did not comply with the minde of those Priests belonging to the Flamins of Lydia ; as if both his cause and the success depended upon the punctual observation of such Rites; when rather it was the ends of those, who could not gain dignity sufficient to comply with their ambitions, but by the perswading King Arethusius , that his prosperity depended upon his parties affection, who were tied onely to their old Religion, which his Father had maintained with his Royal Blood. These I say were the Chymera's that reigned in Creses brains during his sickness; but that which most troubled his apprehension was, to think when he should again return to the sweet Princess Cloria , where he had left her in Amarillia's Castle, what a strange metamorphosis he should produce to her consideration; appearing as he imagined, a creature either fit to be contemned, or altogether hated, since she still observed the Lydian Ceremonies: but fearing more his own danger, then desiring any continued honour, since both doubt and desperation, are accustomed to qualifie the flames of all ambition, he resolved according to the Priests instruction, to be converted to his principles; for that as his private reason could not contradict his arguments, so was his own condition in no case to refuse the offer; especially bringing with the entertainment, as he thought security, however not appetite: And concerning Arethusius and Cloria , he determined notwithstanding the opposition of any passion, to honour still their memories, if his alteration could not serve their persons. The night after these inward disputations, or rather might they be esteemed confusions, his many dreams and slumbers were accompanied with such consolations, that they appeared to resemble raptures and extasies; which the more confirmed his resolution, and brought also into his minde, a desire if he recovered his health, (not caring now for Mazarius frowns, or envying Manchinus fruition) to perform speedily a Pilgrimage to the holy City of Delphos , there to offer up a vow upon the sacred Altar of the Gods, never again to return to the Herefian Religion, either in opinion or practice. In this posture for some weeks he continued, by degrees mending in his health, as if the religious application to his soul, had had a kinde of miraculous influence upon his body; now seemingly discontent in nothing, but that his lingring disease, gave not his thoughts and desires, dispatch enough towards his intended Pilgrimage, (new conversions for the most part, being violent in the beginning, whereby to prove those mysteries, that had been the cause of their change) until one morning very early, his ears were saluted by a kinde of a confused cry in the Town, however not well to be distinguished, whether of Souldiers or other people; which made Creses fear some beating up of Quarters by the enemy, not being ignorant of many Garrisons lying promiscuously all about the whole Countrey; wherefore presently calling to him the Boy, that continually since his comming thither, had waited upon his person in his Chamber, he willed him quickly to enquire in the next street, what the noise and combustion should be: About half an hour after the youth returned again, with the old Priest in his company, who quickly informed Creses , that the Tumult proceeded from a surprize of Amarillia's Castle, newly taken by the Lydian Forces, having carried both the Lady and the Princess Cloria , prisoners into the Town of Deorcas ; and however they had been followed and pursued by certain Troops of the Souldiers of Pamphilia , yet had they escaped all their endeavours, notwithstanding the encounter on both sides had been bloody and desperate; onely the Commander in chief of that stratagem was brought wounded to the Town with some Souldiers of the party: This intelligence, put Creses again into new extasies, since as it should seem his late Devotions, had not so perfectly settled his passions towards the Gods Worship, that the former inflamation of his love to the Royal Family, could be so easily cast off and forgotten; for presently in a kinde of a fury raising himself in his bed, he began not onely to complain of his own misfortunes, that had been the occasion partly to bring the Princess from the Syrian Court, where she remained in a respectful security, under the protection of her dear Mother, but found fault also extreamly with the Heavens injustice, to suffer so supream a wickedness to be performed, without either assistance or revenge: With these sayings in a certain indiscreet desperation, offered to lay violent hands upon his own person, tearing off the cloaths that bound up his almost cured wounds; but the old Priest suddenly coming to the rescue, finding him in those extravagancies, told him, that as these attempts were the ready way, to bring down the Gods curses upon all his actions, and future endeavours, instead of gaining benefit by his conversion and resolutions, so were they no other in humane policy, but meer effects of folly and madness; when as by a moderate temper, in bearing wisely what could not be helped, he might come to know that, which in time probably would procure some remedy; especially seeing the Captain of the design was a Lydian Subject, and now under the Egyptian power, who for the saving of his life, in all likelihood would discover many mysteries of the enemies, whereby not-onely the Princess Cloria might be recovered, but the Town of Deorcas surprized, to a far greater advantage, then if this accident had never happened: Although grief and apprehension is not totally to be qualified by the best Rhetorick, yet Creses being a person of much moderation in his nature, by degrees reflecting upon the circumstances of the business, (as that passion could not now prevent, but consideration might remedy) after a while began to entertain the wise perswasions of the Religions; insomuch as he determined, to seek some opportunity of Conference with the Lydian Commander: Wherefore presently sending to the Governour of the Town, he desired the favour from his Authority, that notwithstanding there might be some intentions to put the Captain to death, for the bold attempt upon the Pamphilian quarters, yet in regard he was a Lydian Officer, who had been the occasion of the Princess restraint, for fear of more prejudice to her person, he would suspend all prosecution of that kinde, until himself had examined the party, whereby also some good perhaps, as he said, might arise to the Egyptian Government; in that probably Deorcas surrender back again, depended much upon such a Treaty. As the chief Officer made no difficulty to grant Creses request, notwithstanding he still put on a face of threatning in outward shew, so within two or three dayes, the Commander having received some refreshments, by the care of the Physicians and Chyrurgeons in the Town, Creses went in person to visit him, pretending for Countrey sake, he was willing to do him any service, either towards saving of his life, or procuring of his liberty. The Captain (whose name was Locrinus ) made him this Reply: Truly Sir, said he, as I value not my life, if it be onely to be obtained by any base or unworthy submission, so of the other side, if you shall think my actions past deserve any excuse, or my intentions to come may merit belief, I will not refuse your favour; and the rather, for that I understand, you have no ordinary relation to King Arethusius concernments; whose Titles and Interest, perhaps belong as rightfully to me as to you: After they were both sate down together, Creses being as willing to hear what he could say, as the other to discourse the story, he began in this manner. To this purpose be pleased to know, said he, that Myssia gave me birth, as Monterosus that gallant Commander, afforded me entertainment at first in his designs; I comming newly from the Wars of Syria , there involved an Officer in the Kings own Guard, out of which I put my self to serve under that brave Generall, being then in the very heat of his contention, with his exasperated enemy Argylius , whose ambition made him disloyal, and his disloyalty tendred him cruel; and that cruelty alwayes accompanied by fear, never left that fatal prosecution, until he had made Monterosus blood the desired Trophey of his unnatural conquest; since in the execution he quitted both honour and humanity, to purchase as he thought security, if not glory; security from his opposers weakness, and glory by his parties prosperity; the one trembling at the memory of his power, and the other flattering the excellency of his fortune; all which particulars for brevity I omit; as well not to renew my own grief in the discovery, as to trouble your patience in the hearing: However I must tell you, the remembrance of his unnatural death crying daily in my ears, made me resolve to finde wayes not onely to plague Argylius Family, but to destroy my own Countrey; the one as I thought depending upon the other; for that as he seemed to protect it, so the people maintained him, as well in what concerned the destruction of the Kings Rights, as in those subjections that belonged to their own freedom: so that putting my self in those Troops under Hercrombrotus Commands, in that manner I marched into our Countrey; where in short it was my fortune, to do such service, both in the discovery of the enemies designs, and the suppression of their Forces, that in a little time I became a most favoured friend of Hercrombrotus: Insomuch as he after a while, not onely trusted me with his private secrets, but gave me his near Kinswoman in Marriage; by which means I grew both powerful and prosperous; in regard Argylius Family was over-born, and the Kings driven out of Myssia: But in the interim that the souldiers were pillaging the Towns, and the Officers securing the Nobility, Hercrombrotus himself fell dangerous sick; not probably to escape in the opinion of many, and not desired he should live by the wishes of any; since as his victories (as they thought) presaged ill omens to their new Commonwealth, so his actions procured envy from those that had a desire to become greatest themselves: Wherefore the Senate taking advantage as well of the time as of the occasion, and not doubting but the effect had preceded the report, without giving any particular notice, either to himself or his Councel, ordained four Officers, to take care both of the Countrey and the Army: When Hercrombrotus (now again recovering his health) perceived their intentions, having cause more then enough to blame their ingratitudes, (if not to finde fault with their fears) one day calling me privately into his Bed Chamber, having first shut the doors with his own hands, when we were both seated together in a Couch, he used this language unto me. Locrinus , said he, my good Friend and Kinsman, if all the services I have done for the unworthy Senate, were but calculated by an indifferent computation; I might be thought a Captain deserving the worlds command, much more not to be directed by such people, who can neither value merits in others, nor become meritorious themselves whilst they sit still in sloath and luxury, to perform acts of cruelty and injustice; fearing in the interim, all good and valiant men, because they cannot confide in their own vertues, so far as to dispute (much less to bestow) rewards upon them: Cannot the conquering of all Lydia (with this mountainous Countrey of Myssia , that no enemy durst ever yet attempt for fear of being either betrayed or starved) serve for a sufficient testimony both of my fidelity and courage, towards that Assembly, that now onely rules, by the lustre that my industry and pains brought them in their necessity? Must my capacity and imployment be circumvented, if not taken away by those men, who are scarce Souldiers in their thoughts, much less Commanders in profession, whilst I poorly go back to my own home, without glory or satisfaction? Are those many Battles, which with active Troops I have won, through dark clouds of blood and sweat, be less then a perpetual honour to that cause, we have so industriously maintained, against all opposers that furiously contended with the sharpness of our weapons? O you Gods, said he, methinks now I doubt the justness of your proceedings, in taking away the life of great Euarchus , by such a Tribunal, that would also bereave me of that fame, by which I first gave them authority, to act so no exampled a Tragedy, beyond either precedent or story: This being considered, what other satisfaction can we offer the just heavens, but to restore again the Son to that Dignity, which with so much violence, we took from the unfortunate Father? though here some Divine inspiration (said he) seems earnely to check the precipitation of my resolution, lest the base faction of Argylius mixed with covetousness and oppression, should gain the mastery over both parties, who was the chief original of all those miseries which the people of each Countrey complain of: Wherefore Locrinus , I say, imploy all your endeavours to those principles, that may destroy Argylius pride, who would be chief in perswading Arethusius to a compliance, whilst our Souldiers contend with the Senates establishment, who seek onely to perpetuate their own command. When he had delivered thus much, he smilingly looked me in the face, as if he expected from me, not onely an approbation but some wonder; until at last finding I said nothing unto him by way of a reply, he imbraced me in his arms, and told me, that although I served him in the Wars, out of my desire to have the faction of Argylius punished in regard of the spleenitive cruelty he had used towards the person of Monterosus , yet he knew I kept still in my breast certain affections for Arethusius interest; protesting withal that other people were the occasion of his Fathers death, although he were made the chief object of hatred in that particular: Although I very much suspected the nature of his dissembling, yet being most willing to have the Senate opposed, who had laid a strong foundation of Government in their Assembly, determined to comply with him both in words and actions; and to that purpose assured him of my best affections to serve his designs, not onely in regard of my marriage, but of his benefits: Thus we parted to the seeming satisfaction of us both (he supposing I might be instrumental to his purposes in the Kingdom of Myssia , and I believing he would destroy the Senates glory, each of which might produce some good periods according to my own wishes; however I must confess, I knew not well what I could expect, Prince Arethusius being already fled probably from all his hopes; nevertheless with these thoughts I retired presently to my own lodgings. When I was alone in my chamber, I began to consider what might be the chief mysteries of his discourses, knowing he never spoke without an end; and for the most part never did what he said; wherefore he being close in his designs, though now appearing extreamly open in his language, I concluded these must be his purposes, to suppress the Senate, and make himself absolute, which could not well be effected, without giving some hopes to the Royal Party; so that continuing still my spleen to the Argylian Family, as a motive I resolved to run along with him in his courses; the rather for that being already engaged both by alliance and imployment, I could not well fall back without losing his favour, and that consequently would hazzard (if not destroy) the poor estate I had purchased in the Kingdom of Myssia , since the Souldiers under his command, were become the absolute masters of all the Countrey: Besides I did not know, but that he might retain some intentions in his minde, to rectifie at last the injuries of Arethusius , upon hopes that in setting him again in his Throne, he should not onely gain himself immortal glory, by performing an act of such an heroical nature, but procure to his friends and posterity a world of security; since by holding illegal titles by force and oppression, he and they would be alwayes subject to change and faction, when as otherwise quietly they might receive both honours and rewards; whilst my thoughts were daily dwelling on these considerations, he not onely sent me a Commission, to be a principal Officer in the Territories of Myssia (containing a proviso to look strictly to the actions of Argylius ) but not long after himself invaded the jurisdiction of the great Senate. As these unexpected transactions, took up all mens apprehension, every one thinking, but few speaking their mindes, knowing very well, that Hercrombrotus was no pardoner of injuries, scarce of suspicions; so was this new change readily obeyed, almost by all sorts of conditions (the Lydian Subjects being as variable in their fidelity, as inconstant in their actions) so that every vocation fell to their own concernments, as if no accident or government, could much prejudice their good, or bring them any great ill; however 'twas onely their little foresight that made them not weigh the consequence of so huge an alteration, wherein probably within a little time they were to be slaves or nothing; since the waving of Fundamentals, are like the shaking of Arches, one stone being removed out of its place, the whole building is endangered. It was not long after Hercrombrotus had acted this part of aspiring ambition, before he discovered eminent marks, both of his tyranny, and his hate towards Arethusius interest, though he guilded still his actions over with nothing but profession of piety and humility: First he made continual orations to the common people of Religion and the true Worship of the Gods, with his eyes cast up to the heavens, as if his heart were alwayes there fixed, whilst he used such familiarities with the ordinary Souldiers, as if he esteemed himself but one of them in quality, notwithstanding the great dignity of Chief Majestrate was cast upon him by providence without his own seeking: Nevertheless under hand he caused intimations to be spread abroad, that it was impossible the Nation could be governed otherwise then by such a single person, whose worth had merited the succession to be cast upon his posterity, for redeeming (by his prosperous valour) the Subjects liberties; withal openly at the same time, prosecuting all those most violently, that he knew any way to have been of Euarchus party; not onely with imprisonments and other punishments, but also by oppression and extortion, though he laid still the fault upon his Officers of State; who appeared (as he said) to be jealous of the Countreys prosperity, fearing perhaps else, combustion and troubles might arise to his present usurpation: These testimonies were sufficient to demonstrate, that he as well aimed at a perpetuity in command, as that he had an absolute intention in his minde, to suppress any growing interest, that Prince Arethusius might possibly procure, whereby again to renew his almost lost title: This being contrary to the profession he had made to me often in private, of his own desires and intentions, I must confess did not a little startle my imagination, when the report came to my ears in the Kingdom of Myssia ; however (as it should seem) the better to fortifie the smooth course of his designs, towards the progress of his affairs, he caused presently a new Senate to be assembled, whereby to compose differences, or take away grievances; though in the ieterim, when they were met together, his Agents by discourses endeavoured to settle the succession of the Crown upon his Heirs, if not by name of the King, because the Army so much hated that Title, yet by a new denomination, that in effect challenged the same honour and power; which being upon the matter compassed, (since the appointment of his successour, was referred to his election and dispose) this Senate was also dissolved, to the general distaste of the people; whose tongues notwithstanding, would not let them utter any thing towards opposition; into so base a stupidity had the many changes of Government wrought both in their mindes and actions, that they were willing to submit to any Rule, rather then hazzard in the least kinde their fortunes, or disturb their quiet; slavish subjection ever following Sensuality in practice, and Atheism in opinion; such people not having souls endued with so much generosity, as to reflect upon any condition, that bears the name of eternity, either in memory or fruition. Creses doubting that Locrinus intended but to trifle, whereby to procure favour for the present in his necessities, since as yet he had made few discoveries, but what himself already knew, since he expected onely those relations, that concern Prince Arethusius Affairs, offered in something a discontented manner to take his leave; but Locrinus quickly finding his thoughts by his countenance, taking him in the interim by the hand, told him, that although hitherto he had made use of many circumstances, for the better method and the righter understanding of his story, yet from thenceforth he should finde things of more consequence; besides some accidents revealed, that he verily believed his imaginations did not reach unto; wherefore desired both his patience and his stay, for yet a little longer: The greedy expectation of Creses , to hear what was the fate of the Princess Cloria and Amarillia in their surprize, made him soon give way to his request; insomuch as Locrinus again prosecuted his relation in this sort. Hercrombrotus , said he, being after this manner, either by his own craft, or the Senates folly, established in that new Throne of Glory, whilst many Ceremonies were invented for the better setting forth of the Dignity, I was with all haste sent for out of the Countrey of Myssia ; where I then remained as Governour of Argylius Province: No sooner was I come to the presence of Hercrombrotus , but according to his usual fashion of dissimulation, he received me with a most chearful countenance, (seldom putting on other to his greatest enemies) and withal discoursed with such loving and familiar language, as if that night I should have been his Bed- fellow, pretended onely out of affectionate confidence; which I must confess tickled my fancy, however it settled not my thoughts, since I knew not how to interpret all these alterations; especially in what concerned my Lord Arethusius affairs, appearing with a face so much now contrary to his own former professions: But the next day notwithstanding taking me alone into the Garden, after many Complements and more smiles had entertained my expectation, he began this discourse: Honest and trusty Locrinus , said he, you see now the pleasure of the immortal Gods, so often divulged by their most sacred and infallible Oracles, in my being thus placed upon the Lydian Throne; and with such a strange providence, that makes not onely the better sort consent to my fate, but keeps the people attentive in their obedience, seeing both Sea and Land thus to concurre in the choice: Nevertheless probable means must not be neglected, to keep all in peace and quietness, since the Heavens commonly work according to humane capacities, not alwayes shewing miracles in mans concernments; though in this last Scean, there appears an operation beyond all understanding, that awes the obstinate, and fortifies the good: To which purpose, for your better regulation, dear Locrinus , said he, you must know, that as I have sent messengers already, to the Religious Arch-Flamin of Delphos , although of a contrary Worship to my Principles, whereby to be the more strengthened in my election, so have I also made an inviolable league with the Syrian Monarchy against the Egyptian greatness, whose wealth must supply our occasions, if our intended Invasions can prevail against the fortunate Islands, notwithstanding Osiris the King of Egypt hath at present an Ambassadour remaining in this rich City of Sardis . These acts as I tell you, must make you messenger to the great Favourite of Syria , to preserve from perishing these designs, before their effect procure happy periods to your self, knowing you to be a person not more trusty in your employments, then wise in your Councels, accompanied also with such excellent parts, for wit, language, and conduct, that none can be able to treat with the circumspect and politick Mazarius , but able and worthy Locrinus ; who equals him in the Syrian Tongue, and perhaps goes beyond him in other stratagems of State: In short, your conditions shall be these, with treasure, not onely to be Commander in the field of six thousand Souldiers, to be sent to Orontes aid, but to continue Ambassadour for Lydia's Interest within the glorious City of Damascus ; corresponding in the interim, with the mighty Favourites secrets, since we both have sworn a perpetual league and friendship, concerning each others greatness and prosperity; the one against the House and Family of Osiris , and the other in opposition to Arethusius pretentions. Though this strange discourse wrought all the faculties of my soul into an amazement; in the first place not having sufficient consideration, for so intricate and unexpected designs; and in the other, fearing I might be suspected touching my fidelity; yet I fell upon this resolution at the present to beg some time of respite for recollection, since those noble employments appeared too weighty and eminent (as I said) for my capacity, as well as my condition was too low to bear the burthen; however I protested still, a sincerity in my services and affections, as well towards himself, as in behalf of that Commonwealth wherein I lived. When I was alone within my own retirements, I reflected most upon these particulars: If I commanded those Forces into the Principality of Pamphilia , I could not avoid to declare my actions, against the Interest and Concernments of King Arethusius , whose assistance now depended chiefly upon the countenance of these Countreys, being banished out of Syria , and excluded Lydia ; but for my employment with the great Favourite Mazarius , I supposed some benefits might arise, as well to help our Prince as good my self; since the knowledge of Court secrets, would open passages probably, either for his advantage or my own continuance; besides Hercrombrotus failing in his Government, the Commonwealth being subject to such diversities of changes, the employment would afford me alwayes a security in retreat, by making my peace, if the Royal Family at any time should prevail, (since Orontes of necessity must be a party) or continue my credit still with Mazarius , whereby I might have competent subsistance; so that after a while I resolved to take upon me the charge, both as General and Ambassadour; the rather, because I not onely understood perfectly the Syrian language, but had spent most part of my youth in Orsames Court: 'Tis true upon my arrival in the beginning at Damascus , the just spleen of Hyacinthia the Queen, extreamly enflamed at my entertainment; but perswasions or flattery after a while, tempered and qualified all her passion; either believing that my reception proceeded colourably from matters of State-policy, or the entire interest of Mazarius with the King, would always beat down her endeavors to the contrary; however I must say the common people (who understood little but their own sense) being enraged rather against the Favourites power, then knowing any thing of Mazarius designs, making his seeming Injustice a Theam, whereby they might take occasion to exclaim, would scarce suffer me to pass the streets, without offering violence to my person; so that I was forced, not onely to procure an Order to be passed, whereby the better to keep me in security, but to beg also an allowed guard of souldiers, for my surer defence and safety. Here Locrinus used some Complements again to excuse the tediousness of his relation, telling Creses he was now upon his last Scean, wherefore a little patience more would attend the finishing of his story, that might give him most content: Creses being willing to understand all he could say, hoping in the end something might be discovered towards the good of Arethusius , or the releasement of his sister Cloria , gave a patient ear to his further discourse, whereupon Locrinus proceeded in this manner. However I continued, said he, for a few moneths in Damascus , partly trembling, and partly triumphing, until my fears called me into these Countreys of Pamphilia , with many Troops of Souldiers, whereby the better to observe the enemies motion. To make relation of the several accidents, that happened in those wars, were too tedious at present for me to relate, onely let it suffice, that the brave Haven of Deorcas , was by our Forces besieged and taken, to the extream discontent of the Egyptian Councel; since it was the safest and most commodious port in those parts, belonging to their King; and a great deal more vexatious it proved to their thoughts, when they knew it was to be put under the Dominion of the Lydian Forces, from whence not long before both Arethusius our Myssian King, and Condorosus the Syrian Prince had escaped by their admirable valour and industry: 'Tis true, some contention there was about the possession; for that the place not onely seemed to guard all the seas between Syria and Lydia , but in former times had vexed the trading Citizens of Sardis , and other Towns appertaining to that Government, during the Reign of the old Queen before Euarchus Father; neither did it spare alwayes the very Subjects of Orontes Grandfather; the inhabitants being people, more given to bring in prizes to their Majestrates, then to conserve Traffick to their Merchants; robbery in that kinde being held, to be the sweetest purchase, when as neither the danger of punishment, or the obligation of account belonged to the profession. In fine I must say, that whilst we thundred out nothing but threatnings against the almost subdued Egyptians , the poor people on every side flying to the best fortified places for refuge, as well for their persons as their estates, news came from the Confines of Lydia of Hercrombrotus sudden death, either violent, as 'twas reported, by his own procurement, or accidental with the strong agitation of his vital spirits, being over-prest by some cares and many contradictions; and wanting confidence sufficient by nature to prevent his fear, in horrid extasies he expired: but time notwithstanding afforded him leasure enough to constitute his eldest Son successour in his dignity, according to the late decrees made by the complying Senate; which must occasion another short story concerning the particulars, if you think the relation worth the hearing: Be pleased to know therefore to this purpose, that he had a Daughter, whose disposition had gained her some respect, of those that her Father most injured, not onely in regard she was thought not to consent to his proceedings, but for that often in publick she condoled them in their miseries, though never durst much in shew oppose his designs; which was the cause that frequently she kept company with the Royal Party, and not seldom also with those of the Delphine Religion: The first made her acquainted with those transactions, whereby Euarchus and his Son were outed from their possessions; and the others shewed her her Religion was not to be defended (as they thought) by ordinary arguments of Reason and Justice: Besides she was informed, that Lydia was once under the jurisdiction of the Arch-Flamin of Delphos , in matters belonging to the Worship of Gods, being dispossest by usurpation and faction, from those rights belonging to his continued authority; when as the sacrifices now in practice in Lydia could claim no further an original, then the memory of some at present living. These inflamations as it should seem so wrought upon her imagination, that falling sick of a Feaver, she found her self within a few weeks, so tormented with sundry frights and settled cogitations, that neither Physick or perswasion could work her any ease; still complaining of something inwardly in her minde, which did not onely hinder her quiet, but put her often into fits of desperation, not to be remedied, as she said darkly, but by the resolutions of her own Father, however to him she was afraid to discover the occasion: The company about her, finding her in these extravagancies, resolved at last to let their Lord Hercrombrotus understand the condition of his Daughter, whom they knew he affected most entirely; so that one day being brought into her Chamber, seating himself upon her bed side, after the people were all put out of the room, she uttered this language in his presence. My Lord, said she, although nature hath placed us here for a time, yet eternity after a while must have us in the other world: 'Tis true, from you I must confess, I have enjoyed life, honour, and riches; however to the Gods I must render an account for them, since the condition I am now in, can no way flatter my hopes with continuance; however not many weeks since, a flourishing prosperity (by reason of your greatness) seemed to crown my youth and beauty; though almost worn out to the last period, if not at present accompanied with some despairs, in that I have not imployed these fortunes to the best advantage: To this purpose, give me leave to reflect upon your actions, for that mine in part must necessarily be derived from those originals, as well by accident as nature, having been produced by the one, as sustained by the other: Nevertheless I humbly acknowledge your extraordinary love in my particular beyond my merit, and much above your other Children, which the more brings into my minde, these considerations and objects of care and doubt; care for your person, and doubt of my own condition; since I can be no more cured of my distempers then you be rectified in your thoughts, unless you shall be pleased to grant me two requests: Hercrombrotus being something amazed and much confounded by a most passionate sorrow, as far as his nature would give him permission, not onely hearkened to his Daughters discourse, but presently promised to fulfil her desire, inwhat should be within the compass of his power to obtain, or belonging to the Lydian jurisdiction to command: Alas then, replyed Clelia , (for so she was called) reflect seriously upon your former quality, from whence you are mounted to this height of dignity; and whether or no you ought not speedily to make satisfaction for the ambition, to that young Prince, now banished by force from his possession, being a Dominion purchased with so much injustice and oppression, that the Gods cannot forget (I fear me) ever the injury, by remarkable testimonies of their wrath, sent down upon the whole family, of which number I now remain a most miserable spectacle; wherefore by all the ties of love, nature, and charity, I beseech you to suffer me in this deplorable state of weakness, confusion, and perplexity, to entertain a correspondency with those persons of the Delphine Worship, notwithstanding your general injunction to the contrary; the rather may I expect this indulgent grant, according to the last passions of your dying, and (if this be denyed) most unfortunate Daughter, because your self as yet, is not settled upon any particular Religion. Hercrombrotus after he had understood this strange, and unexpected discourse of Clelia , (his body swelling with rage, and his eyes sparkling fire, against those propositions, which he conceived so much thwarted his appetite and ends) presently by a most violent motion, was carried out of the Chamber, not giving her any manner of answer at all; thinking belike, his Daughters degenerating from his principles, upon considerations either of mortality or eternity, deserved rather contempt and confusion, then entertainment in his intentions; so much had the worlds pride, and his own ambition, preoccupated his nature in the general, and infatuated his private cogitations within himself; loving her onely but as she appeared to be his ornament, and affecting what was ill of his own, because he was the parent of it; whilst he esteemed the Gods power or goodness no other then fictions to please sense, or invented toyes to affright fools, that kept brave spirits from honour and glory in the world, by burying people in sloath and idleness, under pretence of sanctity and religion. But however Hercrombrotus could not value the tears and sorrows of his most beloved Daughter, in comparison of that extorted glory, which he had an intention, not onely (against heaven and earth) to carry along with him to his grave, but to perpetuate in his blood and posterity; yet poor afflicted Clelia from day to day, felt sadder effects of her distempers, wishing the Gods had either made her less by fate, or rendred her greatness happier in condition, when as the meanest person had a liberty now denyed her, which she fully enjoyed when she was an ordinary maid; neither dreaming of wealth, or hoping for honour; until at last having wasted away all her substance of flesh and blood, by the strong continued agitation of her tired spirits, ( Hercrombrotus not looking upon her, because she was more vertuous then he wished her to be) breathed out her soul to the Gods justice or examination. Notwithstanding Hercrombrotus at the first appeared; not so sensible of his loss, as was imagined, covering it with his craft, or not resenting it in his nature, (since it is the property of ambition, not to be over kinde to any, avoiding the effects of melting compassion, because no obstacles must hinder the end to greatness and power) yet within a night or two, being frighted in his dreams, and tormented in his sleep, started out of his bed, calling for his Sword to maintain his own Dominion (as he said) against his great enemy Prince Arethusius: In fine, Sir, said Locrinus , not to detain you any longer with these circumstances, after he had been often called upon by the Ghost of his deceased Daughter, whereby to render an account concerning her demands, was suddenly in his own Chamber, taken with a most horrid extasie; where voiding of blood, and vomiting of corruption, he at last expired, in the very height of all his glory and prosperity. Thus ended, as I may say, this person, ordained by the heavens to punish the pride and luxury of the Lydian Nation; a man who won Battles without wounds, and by that means rose from a mean condition, to the greatest dignity either fate or fortune could arrive unto in his Countrey; lived above controul, and dyed without pitty; haced by most, and loved by none; almost as much feared in his dissimulation as in his cruelty; since to propagate alwayes his designs, he made his Religion the Commonplace to both, when there was occasion: Though this might be his character in part, yet wise men deemed, that his extraordinary success, proceeded rather from a predominant determination of the Gods, then by his own able conduct, for some end, touching their own Worships, not yet discovered throughly to mortal people; for that things were so ordered and governed in his usurpation, as if chance rather then foresight, thrust on the design, and not contrived it, as one would say, the night undoing what the day for the most part proposed, until some pressing necessity, formed the resolution; not seldom desperate in the execution, or failing in the end: 'Tis true, as I said, his Son for a little space succeeded him in the Throne, with compliance enough, as if people feared the Fathers spirit to rise amongst them again, or believed he was not yet dead; because his image still appeared, as well in name as in effigies: But the Souldiers who scarce knew any obedience (much less complements) heated by liberty and pinched by want; after a while, finding he intended more order in Government, then agreed either with their appetites or commodity, because they would rule and not be ruled, upon an instant displaced him from his seat, setting up a Senate, which they hoped better to command, for that without such a creation, they had not been at all. In this posture as I am informed, the State of Lydia yet stands, subject to change, and not capable to act, wanting friends and having no money; whereupon Leagues abroad must be overthrown and not likely to be renewed; since the government of the whole being altered, Treaties by a multitude will finde opposition, and so consequently protraction, which probably must obstruct obedience as well as success, to the hazzarding of all at last by confusion. Now, said he, if you please, I shall come to my last period, concerning the Princess Cloria's surprize: To this purpose I say, finding that I could build no certain hopes upon the Government of Lydia , being in this posture, and perceiving an inclination of peace between the two Crowns of Egypt and Syria , wherein I suppose Mazarius will be an eminent instrument, I thought it no other then a laudible piece of policy, to become Master in possession of that vertuous Lady the Princess Cloria , according to a plot contrived between me and young Manchinus ; however in our retreat, being followed by a squadron of horse belonging to the enemy, I was forced with my Troop to interpose, whilst Manchinus , with the Princess and the Lady Amarillia marched away; by which action I became my self a prisoner, to be disposed on now as you please. When Locrinus had finished this discourse, it was some question in Creses minde, whether he should presently slaughter him in the place, for that injury he had done to the Princess Cloria , notwithstanding any fair pretentions, concerning the Royall Family, or render himself his friend most entirely, in regard of those secret passages he had revealed, belonging to the Syrian Favourite; so that he continued in a muse for some time, until at last rising up suddenly from his seat, he quitted the Chamber, without making any reply at all, in that manner returning to his own quarters in the Town, where being retired into a certain little Garden, belonging to his Lodgings, he entred more particularly upon these considerations. How that if he did use violence to the person of Locrinus , being now onely a prisoner of war under the Jurisdiction of the Pamphilian Government, it should not onely appear to be an act of extraordinary rashness, but would be interpreted as a direct breach contrary to the Law of Arms, thus in cold blood to assail an enemy; especially having yielded, either upon conditions or at will: Besides what prejudice the party might receive in this nature, probably would redound to the worse usage of Cloria , being now in the power of the Garrison of Deorcas ; when as in complying something, both with the Commander and the accident, she might be the better secured where she was, and he fullier instructed how to carry his affairs in the future, either for her release, or Arethusius benefit: But whilst Creses was resolving of his own intendments, without any absolute determination, there came a discharge for Locrinus , grounded upon a Cessation of Hostility between the two Kings, in further order, to the intended peace, which was at present treated upon, for the good and settlement of the greatest part of Asia: However this peremptory injunction something startled Creses thoughts, thus to be outed in a sort of his hopes, concerning the Captivity of Locrinus , whereby he thought to procure the freedom of Cloria , with other advantages; yet was he again extreamly satisfied to suppose, by the agreement of these formerly exasperated Monarchs, Arethusius concernments would not onely receive life but assistance; without which it was unpossible (as he believed) he could be made able to contend with his powerful enemies; wherefore presently engaging Locrinus with a thousand conjurations, to be serviceable to the Princess and her Brother, parting from him in a friendly manner, he resolved to wait onely upon his own cure, for his future voyage towards Arethusius Court; no obstacle more appearing now but his wounds, since the truce already granted free passage to every person, of each party without molestation. Locrinus by this means being on his journey, towards the strong City of Deorcas , glad of his freedom and confident in his purposes, in the way began to think, that unless he could procure his souldiers pay, from the now sitting Senate at Sardis , they might probably mutiny to his disadvantage; besides he knew not with what face of respect, to appear before the presence of that sweet Princess, whom he had so much injured by his late surprize. These considerations made him resolve, first to prosecute a voyage into the Countrey of Lydia , there not onely to get money for his Garrison, but to enquire further after the Senates settlement, since the Course he was to stear, depended as he thought upon the confusion, or establishment of that State; and so consequently in joyning, or not joyning with Mazarius designs, who seemed at present to have something changed his determinations, seeking to bring on the general peace with some violence; which appeared of no small concernment, to the foundation of Lydia's new Government. These considerations, I say, employed the thoughts of Locrinus for some dayes space, keeping on still notwithstanding, his course towards his first intendments, though with a wavering kinde of uncertainty in his resolutions, whether he should travel towards Deorcas or Lydia , both yet being alike commodious for the Road; until of a sudden he might hear a horn blow, as if some unexpected messenger hasted in the way, belonging either to private business or common intelligence; which made him quickly alight from his horse, in regard the passage seemed over narrow, between two small banks, that made a steep descent, dangerous for any accidental shock or encounter; where about the middle of the hill, he met a Gentleman of the Syrian Nation, appertaining to the Ambassadour yet remaining in Lydia ; who being a person of his former acquaintance, (whilst he lived at Court) he made bold to stop him in his hasty speed: After some short Complements he desired, if his business could any way admit of the protraction, that he would be pleased to give him some accompt of Occurrences belonging to Sardis , from whence he supposed he came, since the late revolution of affairs (as he said) could not but produce strange accidents, if not absolute wonders: Whereupon the party with a kinde of merry countenance presently told him, that as himself had been dispatched from his Lord and Master, with Letters to the Court of Syria , so if he were curious of any information out of that Countrey, from whence he not long ago parted, he would instantly meet him in the Wood at the bottom of the precipice; so that after he had disposed of his horse to his guide, Locrinus glad of this occasion, whereby he might be something instructed in his journey, (delivering also his own steed to one of his servants) made haste to the grove mentioned, to provide a fit station for their communication; where long he had not remained, before the Gentleman accordingly arrived; and presently seating themselves at the foot of a tree, the messenger in the Syrian tongue gave him this account. After, said he, that young Hercrombrotus (as perhaps you may have already heard) had quitted under his hand and seal the Government, which his Father at his death bequeathed unto him, not having a competent courage to contend for that extorted Legacy, which had been usurped in his time by so much blood and cruelty, (as it should seem terrified from his Dominion, like Children in the School deprived of their toyes for fear of beating) the command was soon cast upon the old Senate, that almost in years and number was worn out of date: and certainly had so continued, but that the Souldiers knew very well, there was no other way probable left them, to supply their pressing occasions, but by instituting a seeming Court of supreme Authority, which they supposed would be directed as they pleased, either to be commanded alwayes by their power, or whereby to work money by force, from the suffering and unsatisfied people, as if both Law and Justice went along with the action; when as this Senate is known to be, neither what it was in its first constitution, or what it ought to continue in the opinion of any, having been moulded so often by the Commanders powers, nothing being seemingly left it, as is said, but cruelty and corruption; when as they make the Gods Worship the chief stale of their pretences, and their frequent cabals their onely practice in effect; enriching themselves and impoverishing others, whilst the whole State in the interim suffers by confusion: This I will not affirm to be my own thoughts, but sure I am they be the characters given by most, whose spleen perhaps may over-power their judgements, in regard their loss doth provoke their revenge; but I shall leave these digressions, and follow more particularly my relation. No sooner, as I say, did this assembly meet together, (whether then of a minde to do as they made a shew, or still kept in their bosoms a hidden intention of dissimulation) but they put forth a plausible decree to the people, wherein they professed before the immortal Gods, as by their favour they acknowledged themselves now to have met again, vested with their old authority, so would they imploy their whole endeavours, to possess the suffering Subjects with their ancient Liberties, descended rightly unto them, both by Law and Custom; protesting also violently, not onely against Prince Arethusius Titles to the Crown, but the Nobilities priviledge concerning their Birth-right; thereby as it was thought, the better to involve all conditions in such a confused station, that distinctions might not be perceived, and so by consequence, themselves to govern all without controul: Nevertheless long they had not sate in their formal Majesty, disposing of the Nations freedom as they pleased, condemning this man and approving that, either according to their appetites or their interest, before the chief Commanders saluted them with a paper, wherein was contained divers kindes of prescriptions. As these seeming presumptions from the Army, afforded them cause both of fear and passion, which however they neither durst dispute, nor were willing to perform; so in a middle way for their safety, they thought it the best course they could take, rather to protract businesses with dissembled policy, then to deny benefits that could not well be granted; intending nevertheless cunningly, to be quit as soon as they could of their Military masters, who kept them alwayes in so much awe, that it became a question in the thoughts of many, whether their sleep did them more good, accompanied with these jealousies; or their doubts more hurt, followed by some hopes: But being still persecuted, as I say, by the Officers with terrible threats, they were forced oftentimes, to throw away their own determinations, rather then contend with those violent motions, proceeding from a profession, which however they could not love, yet were they unwilling to displease, since they knew without their assistance, they were not able to reign; for as their help was needful to defend the new purchast jurisdiction, from Arethusius long establisht right; so could not their frequent decrees be put every where in full execution, without arms and force, to fortifie their proceedings; wherefore of necessity, they were to hang together like chained links, the one failing, the other must go to the ground, in that the Army could not be well paid but by their orders, as their orders could not be useful to any purpose, unless they were punctually obeyed: notwithstanding that this wavering posture, kept them in some unity, like masty dogs musled to desend a family from robbery; each looking upon another, either with careful or spightful eyes: nevertheless the Senate quickly began to fall upon a new invention, whereby to secure their own being, if not to curb the Souldiers insolency; and that was, to raise another Militia, composed of such Officers and armed people, as most favoured the Senates proceedings; but the old Souldiers hearing of this determination, became suspicious of their intentions, supposing it was designed onely to strengthen themselves against the Armies power, whensoever they had a minde to deny the arrears of their wages already due, or their further request yet to come; besides the Officers feared, they sought to divide the affections of the Forces, from the obedience of their ancient Commanders, with whom they had (as they said) fought many victorious Battles, to the honour, if not for the liberty of the Lydian people. In prosecution of which controversie, divers Troops were drawn out of either side, according to their several affections; however rather with words then weapons to dispute the business, since they both more doubted Prince Arethusius Titles then their own differences, each being alike engaged in that common danger; which could not be but greatly augmented as they thought, if they became not entirely united in the end; insomuch as at last after many contentions, and a few blows, fearing the consequence, they attoned themselves upon these resolutions: First to suppress totally the party of the King in the City of Sardis , and then more seasonably to shew forth their own conveniencies; whilst their thoughts were imployed in these diligences of execution, suddenly news came of a general rising in the Western parts of the Kingdom, in which as it was reported were engaged, not onely all the common people, but most of the Gentry and Nobility of the Countrey, which was thought augmented their cares, and distracted their Councels, the Army being but small, and their Forces very uncertain; since as many of the Souldiers had been sent into other parts, so were their own actions so displeasing, that all were distasted at their power; crying out, that none but the worst of inhabitants were put in command, and the Gods Worship used onely, but the better to colour every oppression, when either ambition or covetousness came in the way, towards the appetites of unconscionable people of their party, who cared for little but their own profit, and profited in nothing so much as by cruelty: However for all these distractions, they dispatched some Souldiers presently from Sardis , under the command of a certain General, whose conduct and judgement they chiefly affected, though his person was deemed too haughty for any subjection, in regard that former experience in the Wars had made him presume, and presumption did no way quadrate with their intentions; nothing being as they thought more prejudicial to a new Commonwealth then such a master; whereas a common Government they onely desired, because neither their courage nor their breeding, could aim at any thing higher then that sphere; where they were sure alwayes to command, though never willing to obey: but necessity was to be preferred either before passion or particular interest, hoping notwithstanding that if he prevailed, some other policy would work him out of esteem; and if he failed in the service he undertook, they perchance might be secured another way, if both did not fall in the fate, which would dissolve the whole Machine of their expectation: They also sent other Officers into divers parts of the Nations, as well to keep the people in quiet, as to muster up their Forces, depending upon certain Troops, kept alwayes in each Province, to be ready at command for these purposes, expecting according to directions also, Souldiers out of Myssia, Crete , and Pamphylia , whereby to strengthen the Army. In this posture I may say I left Lydia , one party marching against the other, however with more spight then haste, although neither seemed to give any leasure to their designs, and were less inclined to any Treaties of pacification: With these words the Messenger rose suddenly from his seat, pretending as his business called him away with some earnestness, so if his employment (as he said) could have admitted of protraction, he would willingly have disputed with him, another particular towards both their satisfaction: Locrinus presently returned him this answer, that since his occasions might not be hindred by the importunity of any, he would dispence so far with his own affairs at the instant, as to accompany him on his way, unto the next nights habitation; as well the better to instruct his own knowledge, in these accidental passages he had related, as to be an eye-witness of his more convenient accommodations, for that he now journeyed through an enemies Countrey, however the late Cessation of Arms, as he said, between Pamphilia and Syria , gave both sides sufficient security: 'Tis true, notwithstanding the length of the way might have afforded them time and opportunity for a great deal of discourse, yet the speed they made to be in their Inn before night, caused them to defer all communication on the Road; nevertheless being arrived at their lodging, whilst their supper was provided at the fire, resting themselves upon two small Couches in their Chamber, they entred again into many disputes upon the former subject, amongst which the Gentleman demanded of Locrinus , what was the reason he seemed so earnestly to serve an interest, that neither was likely to continue any time, or was just in the present possession? Locrinus was something long before he made any reply, as if inwardly he laboured an answer; yet at last he told him in low expressions, that although he would not at the instant contend with him about the justness of the quarrel, in regard there had been so much already said upon that Theam; nevertheless he desired to know the reasons, why he imagined the Senates Jurisdiction now established could not continue; since the Souldiers seemed so earnestly to maintain their pretended Right, or at least wish their usurped Authority: My opinions, said the Messenger, are these: First, in regard of the general distaste of the whole Nation, whereby the Trade and Commerce of the people in time, must of necessity be obstructed, when they finde the Subjects industry and endeavours, cannot maintain any property at all; since the Armies insolency, and the Senates arbitrary Government, leaves no man a certainty; either in his being or his possession; wherefore men will rather look to conserve what they have already, then strive to procure more by any pains; since their posterity cannot be sure, to enjoy the fruits of their labours; until at last perhaps, thrust on by the desperateness of their condition, may rise in Tumults, to relieve themselves from their intollerable oppressions; especially being provoked thereunto, by the rightfulness of Arethusius Titles, if not by the exasperation of the Priests of the Heresian Worship, who will have opportunity enough in their continual Orations, to inflame the Commonalty with the remembrance of their past felicity, and the sense of their present suffering; wherefore by that means they will either make way for the Kings admittance again to his lawful Government, or bring in the power of forreign Forces, since Princes when they shall be agreed amongst themselves, (now probably enough to be effected, by reason of the intended general peace) cannot both in honour and safety, but look upon Arethusius interest, being the greatest sufferer in the world; and the State of Lydia as it now stands, the highest injurer that ever was known, professing neither Morality nor Religion in what kinde soever, nor keeps faith with any other Dominion; changing in their consultations every day from better to worse, though the best order that seems to be amongst them, consists meerly in his Armies Regulation, which drives onely at perpetuating of their Commanders authority, who are endless in covetousness, and boundless in ambition; besides the common Souldiers being infinitely behinde hand in their pay, they will be rendred desperately inclined for satisfaction; which of necessity must produce strange Catastrophe's, since the Countrey hath no money to discharge their Taxes, and the Militia would govern every mans right. Although many of these things, said Locrinus , may be true in the execution, and so perhaps intended by some for interest; yet certainly most of the Senate aim onely, at the framing of a Commonwealth, according to the decorum of Cyprus , wherein at last the Souldiers must be regulated, having no means to be supplied, but by the orderly appointment of Officers, elected out of the people by the Senates authority, which will keep together the affections of every condition; and this joyned with the strength by sea of the Lydian Navy, neither Prince Arethusius Titles, nor the power of the greatest Kings, will be able to overthrow or shake this foundation. I wonder, said the Gentleman, you should be of this opinion; being a person versed in State affairs, since the oppositions now on foot, are both diverse and numerous; besides the natures of them impossible (without apparent miracles) to be by what perswasions soever reconciled; for as the Heresian Interest can no way be pacified, but by their hopes of entirely governing, so the Subjects not able to bear the weight of their present taxations, must fall to a mutiny, notwithstanding the charge shall be encreased, not onely by the wills and pleasures of their peremptory Governours, but be still continued without end by many accidentall necessities, whereby to maintain and uphold this new fate of Arbitration and Tyranny; when as Arethusius pretentions, taken into consideration and well settled, according to the Laws and ancient Customs of the Nation, by a general pardon to be granted to every sort of condition, would not onely quiet all manner of differences, but procure such friendships from other States and Kingdoms, that Trade should be not onely restored, but Commerce prosecuted to the encouraging of industrious Merchants, and the suppressing of wicked intentions: whereas of the contrary, besides the Gods indignation against these wrongful proceedings, an infinity of charge must still be expected to lie upon the people to maintain the erroneous opinions of some fantastical spirits, which is a great deal more dangerous, by reason of continual factions, being not possible to be prevented in Lydia's Horizon, considering the nature of the Subjects, and their diversity of professions: Nor is it enough to bring the Island of Cyprus for a precedent, which you would make the chief pattern of your Government, in that it consists onely of one sort of Inhabitants, more temperate and passive in disposition, then the Lydians have ever been, and all given to Trading and Commerce; neither could that Commonwealth have prospered at the beginning, but by the strong assistance of other States, extreamly envious to the aspiring greatness of the Egyptian Monarchy, who were content any way to clip the wings of that Prince, though none can have any such emulation, concerning the intentions of the King of Lydia , being in a condition now rather to be pittied and commiserated, in regard of his injuries and oppressions; besides, that the example is to be looked upon, of a destructive concernment to all other Dominions of the world, as well in the fantastical levelling humours of that Religion, most prevalent with the Senate and Souldiery, as in the low extractions and fortunes, of those persons that govern at the present, who are to be supplied by no other means, then by the downfall and ruine of the better sort, that have enjoyed their estates for many years, from their noble and worthy Ancestors, without the contradicting of any fate or accident; upon which bases perhaps your people intended to set up, and create new families of their own, differing in blood, and otherwise in conversation from the Kingdoms principles. However, said Locrinus , hitherunto they have prospered, not onely against the attempts and machinations of their most inveterate enemies, but to the wonder and admiration of all Asia , having still cast down every opposition that stood in their way, towards the purposes they have designed to this effect, beating almost every Prince and Commonwealth into a necessity of their friendship and agreement, which hath been done by their power at Sea, and the courage of their Commanders at Land. To this, replyed the messenger, I can give you no other answer, but as all States and Governments within the lesser Asia , have been for these many years so full of their own troubles (besides particular emulations and suspicions) that they could not think, either of requitals or conquest; so of the other side, what your Army hath done at home against the Kings Forces, besides the suppressing of tumults in Lydia, Myssia , and Crete , certainly hath been acted rather, by predominate fate and providence, conducing to some strange period (ordered by the heavens, for the punishing of wickedness) then by either the wisdom of your Councels, or the valour of the Souldiers; since in the first place it is known, you go not upon approved or probable maximes; as in the other, it is scarce visible, that any of your Officers have been, either wounded or killed in the Wars, when a multitude of the Kings side, have fallen in their attempts, though with all the honour and courage possibly could be expected, by people meriting fame and renown, as well concerning their resolutions in dying bravely, as in their cause for which they suffered; alwayes shewing mercy when it was desired, when you ever cruelty undeserved: Wherefore I must tell you according to my opinion, your allegations are rather marks of the Gods indignation against your proceedings and purposes, then testimonies of their pleasure and satisfaction; which makes me confident, they reserve some hidden revenge in their own bosoms, not yet throughly discovered to the world, since successes are not onely arguments of Right and Justice; however true principles never can be fallacies; which certainly at last will fall heavy upon the instruments of these oppressions, unless we could believe, the heavens have lost their power, or men were become omnipotent; for it is the cause and not the fortune, that crowns any one a Martyr: Nay, is it possible you can think, a Civil War can possibly end in an absolute conquest? when as the contrary party must either be destroyed by cruelty, or suppressed by tyranny; and to slaughter them every one were impossible to think, in regard, (as well) of their number as of their posterity; and to render them all slaves, as is unexampled in story; for that by many occasions, Arms some time or other would be put into their hands towards a revenge; especially there being on foot alwayes a just title to countenance rising, and a forreign assistance to animate their courages, each conducing to a redemption; when it is not to be doubted, but their hearts and opinions will not be altered, no more then their spirits abated; since they cannot but consider, who it is in the interim that would govern as masters, and what right they have to bear rule over them, being men not abler then they in capacity, and worse a great deal in condition: so that I must conclude, these violences cannot hold any time, nor your dominion likely long to continue; wherefore your new Commonwealth must either fall into the Monarchy of some one of your own Commanders, more violent and rigorous then formerly was any, or end in so perplext a confusion, that the whole Nation must be brought to an absolute destruction, if the right interest be not admitted and compounded withal. But as they were further disputing upon this subject, the master of the house came up into their chamber, to call them to supper; which however for the present it diverted them from their intentions of other discourse, although perhaps much more could not have been alledged to that purpose, yet in the way (since they were to pass through a Garden, before they could come into the Parlour) they demanded of the Landlord, what news was now most predominant in the Countrey of Pamphylia , for that as they said, the general cessation of Arms on either side, must of necessity afford a world of content to the common people, who had not possessed so great a happiness this many years: 'Tis true, replyed the Inn-keeper, and for a better confirmation of the intended peace we all long so much after, yesterday there arrived here a Post, who brought orders to the Majestrates of this Town, that with all expedition they should prepare a stately Theatre, whereon the Ceremony belonging to the Agreement might be performed at the publishing of the accord: Besides it is further certified, that there being lately born to Osiris King of Egypt a young Son, whereby his vast Empire may be inherited by a Prince of the same blood; undoubtedly there will follow a match, between Orontes Monarch of Syria , and our Kings onely Daughter, whereby the better to strengthen the alliance, as well as to confirm the friendship, that for so long a season hath been disputed with most exasperate spleen; by which means with their joynt Forces, they may not onely make the world tremble, but afford a great deal of consolation, to many injured and oppressed Princes: By this time they were come to the dining-room, where the company attended; so that no answer could be returned, since presently every one saluting one another according to the Countrey civility, they at last all sate down at the table to supper; which being finished within an hours space, each went to his rest, answerable to the commodity of the place. Locrinus when he was in his Chamber, being not yet absolutely resolved of his course, began to consider, not onely the diversity of passages and changes, lately fallen out in Lydia , but the reasons the Syrian Gentleman he laid before his judgement; as well in regard of the instability of the Government and interest he now served, as the titles of Arethusius , with the probable exasperation of all other Princes, who could not be as he thought, but exceedingly distasted at such examples, wherein the Subjects plaid the masters with their Lords and chief Governour so often, being a pernicious leading case to other people of the same temper and power; though by reason of their own occasions they had yet dissembled the business, yet could never forget the president: In the next place he reflected upon the probability of conquering the Countrey of Lydia by joyned Forces; since as the peace between the two mighty Crowns was near the concluding, so the differences belonging to the Senates jurisdiction increased, as well by open rebellions as private factions; besides that scarce an interest in the whole Nation was satisfied, although the spleen of the contrary party, was as high as ever, the Merchants wanting trade, and the people oppressed, in that the Souldiers hindred the one, and eat up the other, without the least hopes that either taxations should be lessened, or any others assigned to govern their fortunes but the meer creatures of an insulting Army; which notwithstanding were not so many in number, as peremptory in their commands; so that he concluded in his thoughts, that is was impossible however the risings now on foot should fail, but some sudden attempt would succeed the disaster, either to more blood or a sounder destruction, when the King of Egypt was so much exasperated, and the Monarch of Syria so nearly allied; but then again he bethought himself, that the power of the Lydian Navy, which the courage of their brave Commanders, might keep off all invasions, by the same success that had hitherunto ever prospered their actions: and this notwithstanding any opposition could be made against their proceedings; since holding still the accord with the Syrian State, and linking fast to the friendship of the Island of Cyprus , no Forces either by Sea or Land, would much prejudice their being or government, all the factions at home being but weak and not united: yet he could not but doubt of the constancy of Cyprus and Syria to the Senates interest, when the first should think to gain by the overthrow of the Lydians , who took much of their trading from their profit, by reason of their numerous shipping; and for the other, he thought both blood and honour could not but engage that Nation at last in Arethusius quarrel; especially the differences being laid aside between Orontes and Osiris ; which opposition was the onely reason, why any accord at all was made at the first, concerning the Syrian and Lydian people, that now as he supposed might very well be broken, since the Government at Sardis was absolutely changed, and the contract onely made with Hercrombrotus ; States and Kingdoms never wanting pretences, when they finde their Swords sharp enough to contend, for any thing they would have or contradict; besides he could not perswade his apprehensions, but the scores belonging to the Queen Hyacinthia's Dower, with other Damages sustained by the State of Syria , would be strictly required of the new settled Governours, when an opportunity was ripe for any demands, since that Nation seldom used to be behinde hand being affronted, or could the King thereof in honour forget their nearest Kinsman. All these reasons put together, something terrified Locrinus thoughts, from a continuance of his service to the Lydian Government; however a certain kinde of Myssian covetousness kept his desires yet from breaking altogether with the Senate: wherefore as he resolved to alter his course at the present, intended for the Lydian Dominions, until he might get more knowledge concerning the risings now in the Countrey, so was he resolved to take the opportunity of the Gentlemans company to the City of Damascus ; in the interim pretending a kinde of authority yet remaining in him, by reason of his former Commission, as Ambassadour and General of the Army, sent towards the assistance of the King of Syria : In that place he believed, he might play his game to the best advantage; not onely in regard of the distance, but the nearness to Mazarius secrets, with whose weapons he chiefly trusted to defend himself, in all accidents of fortune and power. The next morning Locrinus made the Syrian Gentleman acquainted with his intention; wherefore both taking new post-horses in the Town, they travelled together towards the City of Damascus ; nevertheless being there arrived, they not onely understood the great Favourite, was already gone in haste to the Confines of the Kingdom of Egypt , to meet the Mynion of that Monarch, whereby the better to facilitate the Treaty of Peace, in regard of some differences yet in contestation, but the Court was also removed nearer those parts, with determination to celebrate a marriage between young Orontes , and the onely Daughter of Osiris: This unexpected advertisement put Locrinus into another quandary, as well thus to be deprived of his chief protection, as that he was not throughly provided of Commissions, either as Ambassadour or Commander of the Lydian Forces, by reason of the several changes of Government in Sardis ; so that he could not as he thought, either well fortifie his proceedings at home, or secure them abroad, being fearful of his own safety in that vaste Town, altogether addicted as he knew, to the interest of the Queen Hyacinthia: In these perplexities at last he resolved, to send an Agent privately into the Territories of Lydia , whereby to be fullier informed of the Senates Transactions, and in the interim to keep himself as close as he could possible in the City of Damascus , until he might receive certain intelligence, both concerning the general peace, and also the Lydian Commonwealth. However Locrinus quickly put in execution these purposes of retirement and dispatches, yet he could not lie so secretly in the Town, but that he was at last discovered by the enraged Rabble, who presently in confused tumults went to his house, seated not very far distant from a high mountain: These people though they were not of Hyacinthia's Court, yet shewed themselves of her faction; for another Ambassadour at the same time passing by the place, with more fury then consideration, (their passions not giving them any leasure for distinction) not onely violently interrupted the passage of his Chariot, but seized upon his priviledged person, swearing by all the immortal Gods, they would instantly cast him down the craggy Rocks, as well in revenge of Euarchus death, as of Hyacinthia's injuries; she being a Daughter of the Syrian Monarchy, wherefore was to be righted by any irregular Justice, though controverted by the power of Court policy, that served for nothing else, as they said, but to hide wickedness, and encourage sin: The perplexities that surprized this eminent Minister of State may very well be imagined, being ready in this manner to be sacrificed for faults not committed by him, wherein he wanted words loud enough to make them understand, as themselves ears by reason of the confusion to hear: These are the actions of the inferiour sort of people, when they are inflamed in their fancy, by any kinde of passion, alwayes to do cruelly, and hear no pacification, though oftentimes their own ruine is the price of their heady endeavours, which they onely are perswaded to see at their last end, crying then dejectedly for mercy, when nothing is left them for a cure, but to dye easily by the executioner; but as I say, however reason could not prevail to instruct these intended Murtherers, from their purposes of hatred and revenge, which their precipitate spleen had apprehended more then carefully digested, yet fortune became a friend to the Ambassadour in the prevention; for at the same instant coming by the Chief Magistrate of the City, with a great guard of Horsemen, for his attendants, not onely the mistaken person was quickly relieved in his danger, but also put out of his fear, the multitude quickly dispersing at the sight of such a terrifying Commander, whose office had been often to punish the like disorderly assemblies, with sharp and home punishments; and now in the Kings absence, became more solicitous, if not desperate in his charge. Nevertheless Locrinus , although many had been chastised concerning his particular, thought it his best way, not too much either to provoke the Commonalty, or trust the multitude; since as he supposed scarce any loved his person, and fewer his employment; so was he not very sure, what Maximes or Complements of State, could alwayes keep him safe from accidents of this dangerous nature; especially when Queen Hyacinthia (whose sufferings had contracted from the people a kinde of a reverend pitty) was so near his habitation, though not to act her self in so low a manner; yet from the reflection of her inward hate, might be gathered sparkles to consume, not onely his quiet but his very being; considering the rabble had already attempted his life, without either State Authority or her knowledge; so that resolved suddenly to leave the Town, however other doubts imployed his thoughts for a few dayes, before he could entertain any absolute resolution in his minde. First he was to consider, whether he could make his retirement with most conveniency, either to Deorcas or into Lydia , the one to give him command, as the other would afford him subsistance; nevertheless he durst not venture well upon the Government of that Haven, before he had procur'd money for the Garrison, lest the Souldiers being exasperated by those failings, might deliver up both himself and the Town to Arethusius mercy, who had no great reason to be pacified with his proceedings, not onely in regard of his opposition to all his concernments, but for his late surprize of his dear Sister the Princess Cloria : next concerning his journey to Sardis , where the Senate now sate in nothing but confusions and distempers, wanting means to discharge other obligations, he thought he could neither procure pay, or advance his imployments, without being better informed, how the fates were pleased to dispose of Lydia's jurisdiction; wherefore for his best refuge, he resolved to travel towards the Syrian Court, not doubting though he could not obtain countenance there and esteem, at leastwise he should finde shelter and protection, until he might meet with young Manchinus the Favourites Nephew, with whom he had attempted the dwelling Castle of Amarillia . Locrinus upon this determination (having made his journey) found the King with Andromida his Mother, at a stately Palace belonging to the Crown of Syria ; the materials of the building were all of white Marble, so neatly joyned together with most curious workmanship, that as the whole middle represented a Tomb, or Monument of eternal Fame, erected for some of the first Heroes of the world (being elevated Pyramids-wise to an excessive height) so did the newness of the structure, adorned by many imbellishments shew, it was either more modern, or had come there meerly by exquisite skill: it was circumrounded in its Bases by five out-lets, after the manner of fortified Bulwarks, composed of free-stone, enlarging themselves towards the bottom, until they all met with a seeming standing lake, though the extraordinary clearness of the water was a testimony, it had its original from some excellent Spring: one Draw-bridge onely gave the Castle, as well state as entrance; for that two Giant-like proportions, with chained Lions in their hands, seemed of either side to guard the Gate. 'Tis true, the Kings appartament where he lodged, did by other buildings according to the manner of Damascus appear to besiege that admirable Tower, in the nature of a regular and stately Camp, where one Gallery from another, afforded convenient passages, to spacious Pavillion Chambers, placed frequently in every quarter; amongst which an Oval Room was seen, magnificent above the rest, as it should seem intended to give Orontes entertainment when he pleased; but appointed at other times, for the reception of great Princes and Ambassadours: In the Cupelo was painted (upon a certain Engine made to turn in a circular motion) the Gods sitting in their greatest Majesty, whilst carved Statues round about the walls, represented those Deities historically in some actions or other, which personated them and their proceedings in the world: The Gardens for delight, were on the South-side of the wall, that incompassed the whole Court; however so near the Kings retirements, that when he had a minde either by water, or by land, he could pass to the walks from his own chamber, without being seen by any, whilst their greatness resembled a Forrest furnished with several varieties, as their deliousness a Paradise with multitudes of beauties, wherein Mounts were raised to over-top the Plains, and Groves orderly growing to over-shadow the Grass; Chrystal streams here and there also plaid upon the ground, not onely to conserve the verdure, but to refresh the air, until at last a large River as sole Emperour of all, received the tributes of so many springs into his vast treasury, making the designed superficies of the earth, by his windings, one onely entire Island of Delight: in the middle of which stood a firm Rock, that on the top issued forth so huge a Cascata of water, that it supported a golden Crown of an immeasurable higness in the air to the wonder of the beholders: Locrinus although he had arrived to the journeys end of his first design, yet he found his entertainment was so cold from most of the gallantest Courtiers (who minded rather their own bravery in apparel, whereby the better to honour their Kings marriage, since the Syrian Nobility affected variety of fashions above other people) then the hidden secrets, either of his imployments or his intentions; insomuch as he was not able a long time to procure admittance to Orontes , or scarce countenance from any persons of quality, until at last finding out by his craft, certain Ministers of State belonging to the Favourite (whose interest was not lessened by his absence) he addressed himself to their reception, a favour gained, either by money or violent professions: In this manner desiring them, that as his Embassie merited a competent esteem, being imployed from the great Commonwealth of Lydia , of most concernment to the Kingdom of Syria , so might he obtain an Audience from fortunate Orontes , whereby the same correspondency should be conserved between the two Nations, notwithstanding any peace made with the Egyptian Monarchy: 'Tis true, as I said, importunities or other means, brought him within a day or two to the Kings presence, who received him notwithstanding between jeast and earnest; of one side asking him, whether or no he had a new Commission, since the often changes of the Government in the Lydian Dominions, made it a difficult matter to know, who were the Lords that any Prince was to treat withal; of the other side not being willing to disturb what alliance so ever Mazarius had formerly made, he gave him still licence to remain in his Court. Although Locrinus esteemed this a sufficient favour, to keep him safe without any oppression, yet he blamed extreamly his own want of foresight, that had not used some means or other at Sardis , whereby to renew his authority in effect, as well as by sufferance; since the onely airie name of am Ambassadour, would rather occasion derision then act business. But whilst Locrinus expected his Commission from the great Senate sitting at Sardis , who used a certain kinde of seeming circumspection in every trivial accident, because it tasted more of gravity then precipitation; or at leastwise as they thought, struck the people with an amazed reverence concerning their authority, seeing their actions were not easily to be understood, so coloured them in this manner by circumstances, when perhaps a quick way, would have performed better, and with less trouble, an especial messenger arrived from Mazarius upon the Confines, who brought a particular relation of what had passed between the great Favourite of Egypt and the Syrian Minister. The place of their meeting was (said he) appointed in a small Island of a pregnant nature, though little of circumference, and closed by two artificial Bridges, erected for that purpose: In the midst was built a house of Marble, with a couple of gates for entrance thereunto, mounted by six steps; the whole Fabrick resembling a Star, as an embleme of future lustre to the world, by that happy concord intended: Mazarius advanced to the designed station in his Coach, according to the fashion of the Syrian Nation, accompanied by many of the best Nobility, with some also of the Flamins , whose wisdom and piety most pleased his election, whilst his guard of horse and foot marched in order, before and behinde his Chariot, though Staffiers with embroidered Liveries (carrying Partizans in their hands) went of either side, to be ready assistants towards his service, when there should be occasion, either to execute his commands, or regulate the solemnity; then followed twenty other lesser Cars triumphant, wherein sate all the prime Gentry of his train; the better sort preceding them in more stately carriages: when they came near the Bridge made over the River with three vaste Arches, notice was given to the principle Secretary by a Trumpeter, that the other Favourite was also advanced to the waterside, belonging to Egypts Dominions, riding in his Litter all set with precious Stones, according to his Countrey manner, accompanied also with divers Grandees and other Arch-Priests of the Nation; and being attended in like manner with a guard of Horse and Foot, whilst four and twenty young pages in rich apparel, led so many brave Horses of the Arabian breed: On both borders of the River without the Island, stood two ancient Temples, the one dedicated to the Gods of Egypts Dominion, the other to the Patron of Syria's Monarchy, wherein was performed by each Favourite a most magnificent sacrifice; which being ended they proceeded to their conference, as near as could be directed at the same moment of time, whereby to avoid all jealousies, that might arise concerning each others precedency, whereby the better to conserve the dignity of their great Masters without any dispute or controversie, whilst their followers in curious Barges (a promiscuous way) passed the water, to give their further attendance: The room that was appointed for their meeting was directly Circular, into which opened four doors, according to the heavens division; the top being uncovered in the midst, for the more air and light, since there were no other windows to give it lustre, by reason of the excessive inflamation of the weather in that hot Climate. The Favourites at their first entrance beheld one another with stedfast countenances, yet without speaking one word, as if they contemplated their Masters greatness and power, by the complexion and proportion of their own persons, wherein themselves for so many years seemed to have ruled the whole Universe, and now onely met to give pacification to the world; who like the suns influence heating afar off, gave nourishment to all living things, by some miraculous or hidden mystery: however their habits were different in colour and shape; the one red, the other black, as if by their meanings they intended to shew, the earth hitherunto had been composed of two passions, Blood and Mourning: At last they sate down in their Chairs, calling in their Secretaries, to begin the Conference, though more out of form then substance, in regard that presently after they had performed some circumstances, belonging to the Ceremony of the dispute, they were again commanded out of their presence; where these two mysterious Statesmen continued, for at least three hours space, without the knowledge of any but themselves what they said; however as it was imagined to be very successful, for that most affectionate and seeming intimate Complements, crowned their parting at that time; each presenting to the other, those Lords and Grandees of either Nation, that merited most honour and esteem, with other expressions of love and satisfaction. The second Conference a few dayes after, afforded more matter of Contestation, and a great deal less of Ceremony, in that some heat though much gravity either ushered in or mingled with their discourses, both maintaining too violently the seeming Quarrel almost laid asleep in action, though now prosecuted by them with words, as formerly 'twas by weapons, the business being not so dangerous, however more exasperating: The first beginning of the difference was, from what reasons proceeded the continuation of that war, that now was with so much pains to be, composed, although wisdom should salve the differences by either of their endeavours, in taking away the present difficulties; since both Honour and Justice were both jealous and hard principles to be observed by Princes: Mazarius alledged, the affronts which young Orontes had received from Condorosus actions, countenanced so long a time by his near Kinsman the King of Egypt . This made Aularicus the other Favourite in this nature reply; The like and more was done, said he, by the Assirian Nation, in defending the Prince of Carthage , when he had seized upon his Sovereigns Dominions; besides the open fomenting of Rebellion in Memphis and other Countreys under his Masters Jurisdiction. Mazarius answered, that notwithstanding the King of Syria did make use of those persons with their pretended titles, the better to strengthen himself in those wars, he had designed to recover his own Rights; yet he never entertained in his bosome the Subjects of Osiris , that fell from their allegiance; besides (as he said) the King of Egypt had actually invaded the Territories of Orontes , when the great City of Damascus , contested with open arms against the Princes authority, not suffering him to come within their walls, but by the power and force of an Army. A great deal worse, replyed Aularicus , your master did, when he delivered over the brave Town and Haven of Deorcas , into the hands of his false and malicious enemy Hercrombrotus , who had not onely broke his faith, in falling upon part of the Egyptian Dominions of the fortunate Islands, when an Ambassadour of friendship and commerce remained at Sardis , but profest himself (all he could) a persecutor and hater of the Delphine Religion, which Syria as well as Egypt pretends to worship, whilst in the interim the poor Countrey of Pamphylia undergoes tyranny as well in their estates as in the veneration of the Gods. At these words a kinde of inflammation began to possess the thoughts and spirits of wise Mazarius , until at last after something a long silence, this answer broke from his lips, tempering however his colour a little with patience, as his speech with moderation, as it should seem, being willing to break any way rather then by hasty language or words ill placed; especially knowing Andromida to be most violently bent towards this accommodation. Truly Sir, said he, as the often offers we have made to buy your friendship, by the release of many Towns and Countreys now in our possession, without the full restoration of Condorosus to all his dignities, both against Justice and the Kings Honour; so finding it was your design as well as ours, to procure the Lydian assistance towards our commodity, we thought it not amiss to prevent you in that purpose, and so made our accord before you arrived at that period: however to prevent all mistakes, I must tell you, that notwithstanding by former agreements Hercrombrotus was made master of the Town, yet such were the provisions appointed by the Syrian State, that the Inhabitants of Deorcas should not onely still enjoy their ancient priviledges, but their old Religion against any jurisdiction or change of Government whatsoever. After these words he sate down again in his Chair with a countenance, that rather exprest sorrow then discontent: But this being perceived by a Nobleman of Egypt , who had waited upon Queen Andromida , during her infancy, into the Countrey of Syria , when Orsames and she were first contracted, whereby as it should seem he had inkindled in himself, a kinde of an equal share of love to both Dominions, began with a most grave demeanour to utter this manner of discourse, that tasted not more of affection then wisdom. My Lords (said he) although these aged tears, may not afford you belief of my integrity, or my years old enough any opinion of experience; yet give me leave to tell you both, that this glorious meeting not procuring a Catastrophe, answerable to the worlds expectation; you the great Ministers of State, must undergo the highest infamy, that time ever produced to the world, seeing you are lookt upon as the onely wheels, that turn the Hemesphere of transactions, as well concerning Empires as other private Commonwealths: To doubt of your interest with your Princes, were more then a mad stupidity, when they have heaped upon you so many signal favours, that scarce will they seem to rule in any thing when you are absent; and being present they flying away their own particular appetites, whereby to let it better appear, what violent desire they have you should alwayes command: what obligations you have to the heavens for these happinesses, I must leave you to think rather then my self to deliver, when that people expect from your endeavours, not onely a jubile but a salvation, as the Gods do an advancement of their Worship; which being now cast back again to their first station, must of necessity possess mens mindes, with nothing but thoughts of desperation, whereby Asia will be suddenly turned into another Chaos of confusion; since no changes can ever come again into the same posture, without being better by the attempt, or worse by the effect: Remember Andromida divides an equal share of blood in both Countreys; so that all must be hers that shall be more shed in this quarrel, wherein they that win shall satisfie onely a vain fancy of being conquerours, when in substance they will lose by the victory, if not compelled to make use of every base assistance, whereby to become oftentimes involved in most contemptible conditions, the better to procure strength, to maintain a poor spleen, fit to be expressed by none but unreasonable creatures, whilst other States laugh at the folly, because they keep in the interim their Territories safe by the difference; whereas of the contrary, agreeing in a generous peace, the earth will not onely become tributary to your powers, but the heavens auspicious to your actions; and in particular your selves will be famous to all eternity: I beseech you cast away these impertinent controversies, either of originall injuries, or airie satisfactions; when as wise mens glories are known more by the advantage they shall get, then in the many things they may dispute: If my speech have in any thing displeased your Excellencies, impute it to my age or my fidelity, which ought either to be excused or despised, and so consequently not worth your anger, much less your revenge; if otherwise I shall thank the Gods, for having given me a heart, willing to perswade, or ready to suffer, in a cause of most value now in the world. The Favourites after this resolute oration, as it were in a deep muse, cast down their eyes presently upon the ground, as if they either blamed their own proceedings, or studied for other considerations, which invited or gave way to another Councellour named Leontius of the Syrian Nation, who with a certain kinde of brave garb uttered this language, esteemed not fuller of affection, then reason. If the many journeys I have made into Egypt by Orontes command, to facilitate this great Treaty of Peace; if the violent desires of Andromida , to Crown her young Neece Queen of that huge Empire, which her own wisdom hath governed for so long a season; if those kinde respects and more gracious favours, our young King hath lately demonstrated to his valiant (though stubborn) Cousin Prince Condorosus ; if the deplorable condition of whole Asia , sweating with fears, and stained in blood instead of other moistures, as it were almost consumed by care, and dryed up with famine, incident to War and this miserable contention, wherein people are destroyed, Kings disinherited, and the Gods dishonoured, cannot work the mindes of men into a considerable temper, (when differences might be ended without more slaughter or less malice) yet let it never be reported to after ages, that the onely great Favourites of the mighty Commanders of the World should meet in a triumphant Pageant, to act nothing but their own formal Ceremonies, without finishing their determinations, or giving redress to the afflicted; since it is believed by a happy and propitious accord, the earth may be parted between the two Monarchs, as the red Sea now divides their meers and bounds, whilst the main Ocean in the interim can onely measure out and circumscribe the vast jurisdiction of both their Dominions; which being said, the two eminent Arbitrators of this weighty reconciliation, recommended by their glorious masters, not onely to their judicious care, but faithful integrity, considering the circumstances belonging to the Dignity and Titles of Princes, are for the most part more ticklish to be handled, then the very substance and interest it self that appeared in object, made no reply at all to what had been said, notwithstanding their discourses seemed to have inflamed all the company standing by with diversity of opinions; until at last in a certain kinde of haste, they rose from their seats, and presently retired to their own particular appartaments. Two or three dayes time kept all things in a most deep silence, every body in a manner speaking onely in low whispers, not well knowing what to say, and less how to conjecture, though almost passionately sad for the supposed accident, as if the disaster had prejudicated the downfal of the heavens; the nature of man being apter to be transported with despair falling from hopes, then if by no probabilities it had been encouraged to hope at all, however the person be left still in the same condition as at the first; a fancy belonging to the weakness of judgement, wanting a discreet fortitude, to distinguish proceedings from violent desires; but on a sudden, when all people were preparing for a retiring journey, a new summons came from the Favourites, again to set in order the place for another conference: At this station they both singly appeared, not suffering any to be present in the designed room, where they continued for the space of one hour, until at last they severed again, towards their own accustomed lodgings, none knowing in the interim what their communication had been: but the third day after meeting in a more ceremonious manner, it was given out generally amongst all sorts of company, that the great Ministers of State had not onely agreed upon the marriage to be made, but the particular Articles of Peace to be proclaimed, which inspired new flames of joy, in the breast of every person, being a Subject of either Kingdoms; and so I was dispatched with letters to give that intelligence. As the King with Andromida his Mother, prepared themselves in a most magnificent equipage, to give the designs of great Osiris a speedy meeting; so Locrinus the Lydian Ambassadour, being neither furnished with money for such a stately voyage, nor confident in any opinion his attendance would be acceptable, in regard of the Egyptian spleen towards his masters proceedings, as well as his want of friends in Orontes Court, did not know what determinations to take; for considering if he left the Syrian assistance, and returned again to Damascus , as his person would be unsafe in that City, and his employment out of credit with all the world, so by consequence should he be left in most miserable confusion, when as he was scarce trusted by the Senate, though hated directly by Arethusius: besides he doubted to be forgotten by Mazarius , since Statesmen look onely upon people, as either they are useful, or may be importunate. These perplexities, I say, detained his thoughts for some dayes, as it were in a wilde and intricate Labyrinth, longing extreamly to hear from Sardis , whereby to be better furnished for his place, or his place with more decorum conferred upon his particular; until at last finding his resolutions were not to be protracted, in regard the Court was ready (with extream gallantry and a passionate haste) to be going towards the borders of Egypt , he determined by an invention contrived in his brain to secure himself, and not hazzard his reputation; which was in some disguized habit or other, rather to follow the company, then to desert the Court, whereby as he imagined, he should not onely avoid the burthen of a great expence, but better inform his knowledge of all the passages; wherein as he believed, it would be unpossible for any one to discover his person, when but thus altered, either in face or clothes; especially having first solemnly taken his leave of the King. After Locrinus had fully finished this determination in his minde, he took upon him for execution, the garment of a common souldier, sending his small train in the interim to other parts, for that he pretended he would take new Officers of the Countrey fashion, that might be more serviceable in his designs; when presently (painting his face in several places with black lead, as if in former employments he had received many blows, as well to give a greater opinion of his courage, as the better to transform his condition) he entred himself a Trooper in the Kings guard; a preferment not very difficult to procure, having language and person for the purpose; besides his readiness in Military Discipline, that heretofore he had gained by his frequent practising of that profession: As the Court rested not many dayes in a place, being importuned by the cryes of the people, to visit their grievances, or accept of their affection, so Locrinus wanted not oftentimes trouble enough in his journey; which differed somewhat from the soft accommodation, and quiet sensuality of an Ambassadours life, accustomed for the most part to travel with his head, and suffer his Secretary to watch with his pen, if not seldom to perform both offices, when his master was asleep. But controversies arising between the Flamins of the Kingdom, and those of the Heresian Worship, concerning priviledges obstructed, or immunities extorted, Orontes in some sort was compelled to appoint a day for both parties to be heard, resolving himself in person to be the Royal Arbitrator, as a testimony what justice he intended to distribute amongst his Subjects: And to this purpose staid at a brave Town belonging to his Dominions, near the Confines of the Egyptian Monarchy, as well to be ready upon occasion for the interview of his fair Mistress, as at the time designed to hear that great cause, which belonged to Religious Worship of the Gods after the Heresian manner; for however himself was a zealous observer of the Delphine Ceremonies, yet he thought it both honourable and just, to continue those grants to his Subjects, (however of another belief) which formerly his Ancestors had allowed their predecessors; thinking it a better way to convince their understandings by mildness and perswasion, then by rigour and power; notwithstanding this lenity he was resolved the Heavens should lose nothing, either of of Reality or Form, belonging to the Majesty of their Temples within his Dominions. At length the day came for the hearing of this great difference; the Flamins appearing on the one side, as many of the Heresian Priests on the other; each ready with exasperated spleen, to dispute their own seeming apprehensions, whilst Orontes himself mounted upon a Throne, both awed and invited the assembly to a moderation; until at last a grave person belonging to the Temple of Delphos , with a certain kinde of becoming reverence, towards the King Person, and a religious earnestness concerning his own cause, began in this manner to deliver his thoughts. Most mighty Prince of the Syrian Monarchy, if not chief King of the Delphine Worship, whose piety ought to pattern the world, as your greatness doth command it, not onely as the first Son of the most Sacred Temple, but in regard of the obedience of others to the same principle, which will be your honour, as the Subjects safety; since the duty perswade the Gods, as their influence render prosperous the earth; being created by their omnipotency, and that creation for no other service; neither can they be pleased with divided sacrifices; for as one truth must govern all till every thing perish, so let that truth be protected, lest we perish before the time; at leastwise for the satisfaction of that Goodness divine, that hath granted to humanity such a priviledge, that the heavens tremble to behold: Wherefore I say, be your thoughts regulated to such periods, that eternity after a while may reward your actions, not with fading Diadems of transitory Princes, but with glorious Stars of never dying Fame, accompanied with celestial happiness, never to be taken away by force nor fraud; being absolute in the enjoying, as satisfactory in the possession; when youth will never be lost, and millions of years alwayes renewed, without over society, or too much expectation, alike knowing of what is to come, and not caring for what is past: If these be the glorious attributes, great Sir, of fortunate and blessed souls, esteem them unhappy and miserable that covet other preferments; and by that consequence judge of these men of the Heresian practice, who prophane our Temple, contemn our Sacrifice, and deride our Ceremonies, violently attempting to teach a new Worship of their own, because they would wade through seas of blood and cruelty, whereby to have their humours satisfied to your dishonour, not contenting themselves with those graces, formerly extorted from your Ancestors, by proud and rebellious Armies, by which they tore down Oratories, and slaughtered your people; but now in the very height of your majestick prosperity, would confine your Government to fantastick Laws; as if they not onely contemned your authority, but hated the dominion; whilst in the interim they seek by a levelling envy, to make your Crown below their feet, and the Gods Worship no higher then their obstinacy. The King finding that this exasperate language, however accompanied with much truth, must not onely continue the contention for many weeks in some heat and discord, (which he was unwilling to suffer, in regard of his approaching marriage) but also for that it would give a great deal of discontent, to his trusty general Turinus , who was himself a professour of the Heresian Worship, resolved presently to dismiss their present attendants; saying, as his State occasions called him to other considerations, for his own honour and the benefit of his Subjects, so would he have the cause again debated, when he came to Damascus , where he should have more leasure and better conveniency: Nevertheless he assured the Flamins , that as the advancement of the Gods service, should be his principal endeavours, they might rest satisfied to enjoy, whatsoever belonged to the Rites, and Priviledges of the Sacred Temples: Although these promises in part quieted the Delphine Priests, though not satisfied their mindes; yet those of the Heresian opinion being confident, the King was more then ordinary addicted to favour and countenance their party, (erroneous passion alwayes inclining to fancy, rather necessity then goodness causeth the compliance) of a sudden made certain invective writings to be dispersed, not onely against the chief Flamins , but the very essential points of their Religion: 'Tis true, these bold proceedings, so much enflamed the whole Town, that the Commonalty presently rose in vindication of the affront; vowing they would tear those persons asunder, that had perswaded their young Prince, to countenance that pernicious faith, that formerly had, with so much blood, rebellion, and cruelty, won it self admittance within the Syrian Monarchy, not onely to the grievance and dishonour of Orontes ancestors, but to the prejudice of the Temple of Delphos , wherein the whole body of the people were more then concerned, both in interest and duty: With these clamours, I say, they came to the Court, being scarce to be pacified, either by the Guards perswasion, or the Souldiers violence, until the King was counselled by a present decree, not onely to banish all the Heresian Priests out of the City, but also to give order those slanderous writings should be publickly burnt, as a testimony of zeal to his Religion, and affection to the Flamins of the Kingdom. Locrinus (whose conscience being much governed by his profit, according to the natural inclination of his Countrey-men) was not willing to seem peevish in his outward thoughts, when he might with more pleasing advantage, comply with the rest of his fellow Souldiers; wherefore went along with his companions in the same Troop, to be a curious spectator of that ceremonious justice, though perhaps in the height of his Embassie, he would have disputed the manner, which now he durst not any way own but in such a disguise, as he was confident would obscure him from any bodies knowledge, other then to whom his tongue would reveal the secret: nevertheless there it was his fortune amongst the crowd, to encounter the Heresian Syrian his friend, whom he had obliged before his departure from Damascus , to make a journey on his behalf into the Countrey of Lydia , as well to enquire out those designs in agitation, belonging to the Nation, as to inform himself concerning the change of Sardis Government: 'Tis true, he did not more wonder to see him in that place, then was troubled himself to be discovered; since his own countenance heretofore was accustomed to give lustre, not onely to him in particular, but all those of the Heresian Religion in the great City of Damascus: Nevertheless the violence of self-commodity, prevailing more in his nature (besides much of curiosity) then the passion of vain-glory, he resolved as he appeared, to make his Agent acquainted with his metamorphosis; so that presently taking leave of his fellow companions, he retired him a certain space from the multitude, where he accosted him with a plain discovery who he was; and afterward leading him to a pretty green bank, something without the walls of the Town, being there seated together, he required also of him the particulars of his adventures: The man whose name was Garderius , when he had a little smilingly dwelt upon the consideration, and the prospect of Locrinus disguize, in a more serious manner then upon the first object, delivered this relation of his imployment, according to the several journeys he had made towards his service; the party wanting neither language to express his thoughts, or wit to understand business. Parting, said he, with you at Damascus , I soon arrived at the Haven of Tyrus , for my transportation by water into Lydia ; where finding a small Bark fitted for Cyprus (conceiving in that Island I should meet with a better conveniency) I took the opportunity of a passage; which landed me in four and twenty hours at Salamine ; where in the interim I onely learned this news, that as a strong Fleet had been sent by the State of Lydia into the Euxine Sea, either to compel peace or assist Dogalphus ; so the Commonwealth of Cyprus had designed another from their Territories, as well to aid the contrary Prince, if there followed no agreement, as to conserve their own interest of trading, wholly obstructed as they pretended, by the causes of the King of Scythia's usurpation: wherefore presently leaving those Countreys full of their own desires and expectation, I made haste to accomplish your commands; and by consequence was not long before I attained (in a Cyprian Ship) the borders of the Lydian Dominion; when putting upon Land at the great and flourishing City of Smyrna , I staid for two or three dayes in that place, as well to furnish my self with horses and other necessaries, as to be something informed concerning the estate of that Town, with other passages belonging to the present Government: but when I came to Sardis , it was not long before it was my chance to light upon an understanding person, who acquainted me with these particulars, belonging to the present affairs of the Countrey, which I think not amiss to deliver in an ample manner, seeing you were pleased to imploy me thither chiefly for that purpose. As you have heard, said he, already in a general way, of the late rising by the inhabitants in the North West of Lydia , bordering something near upon the Egean Sea, so may you know the causes of it to be not onely in regard of the often changes in Government, according to the Armies fancy, but the extraordinary tyrannies and oppressions in every part practised by that face of authority, that now governs more by their wills and prerogative, then either by law or reason; wherein they abuse Religion with formal hypocrisie, and sell Justice for their own benefit; whilst a few persons have usurped to themselves the supream power, and the meanest of the Subjects be wholly employed, because they act but according to such prescriptions, knowing nothing but what the Senate dictates, and doing all what it shall propose: This preposterous subjection it is feared, the peoples industry must maintain, whereby the Souldiers alwayes intend to command; whilst trading decayes, and beggery is perpetuated, without hope of being better, and not possible to be endured long: These are the allegations, I say, if not the realities of Lydia's sufferings, which fate certainly it deserveth, since they could not be content with the best constitution in the world when they had it, but want only must desire to change for the worst confusion, onely because envy and pride would not let them see; likely now to be slaves or nothing for that inconstancy: So that now I shall proceed to the relation of more particulars, belonging principally to matter of fact; as most demonstrative, for that the variousness of peoples fancies, either in calamities or luxury, can neither be well known to others, or rightly understood by themselves, wavering continuall in both conditions: But to the purpose. This rising party, as I say, was headed by two principal persons of those Countreys, named Tellanor and Tymon ; whose fortunes were so eminent, that probably covetousness could not be the motive, since well they might lose but could not gain by the action; and if any hidden ambition possessed their thoughts, it was supposed to be, that they intended to prevent Arethusius pretences, from being assisted from forreign Forces, upon the concluding of the peace between Egypt and Syria ; as well in regard strangers, as they thought, should not have any share in the glory of his restitution, (when as his own Subjects were willing to perform the office) as that the Heresian Religion might not be dishonoured by those of the Delphine Worship, which their hearts could not be brought, either to obey or receive; therefore in this attempt neither invited or gave countenance to that profession; but on the contrary with open proclamations, disavowed both their Rites and their persons; however it was believed also, that the King should have been but conditional, if admitted at all to his Throne, in that they declared their taking up Arms was onely for a free Senate, without mentioning a single Governour to be allowed in the Lydian Territories: But whatsoever their intentions might be in the end, it was certain they seized upon many Towns, as also formed their Army into sundry companies and divisions, supposing the Majestrates of Sardis would not be backward to provide Troops, if not to encounter, at leastwise to stop the danger, to their own desired Government; which the Senate endeavoured to perpetuate, although oftentimes they had put on countenances to the contrary; as well to satisfie the peoples hopes, as not to let their ambitions be too much perceived, whereby to prevent other conjunctions from being made the sooner to their destruction; since as resolutions in rule and command best please other States, that for most part profit by changes, so every Prince or Monarch could not be well satisfied, in the King of Lydia's expulsion by his own Subjects, being a principal precedent of a desperate consequence, as might be supposed to their own continuance, and much more to their absolute Jurisdiction: Nevertheless, however it was thought and promised no doubt in Tillanor and Timon's first combination, that the whole Kingdom by this example would have taken arms, out of hate to the Senates proceedings; yet whether over-awed by the Souldiers successes, or willing to let others labour in the Vineyard, whilst themselves rested quiet in their several stations, (however they intended to eat of the Grapes) very few or none appeared in bodies, throughout the whole Nation to take their parts; into so absolute a stupidity or want of courage, are the people of Lydia now wrought, by reason of their frequent sensualities, that they are content to buy their own slavery at any rate, rather then once hazzard their persons, towards the purchase of what freedom soever; hoping still after they know not what, and never acting at all, whereby to purchase any thing; whilst their cares they bury in gurmandizing, and study to forget every remedy for the future; because they will not take the pains to be overmuch troubled with unpleasant apprehensions, or lose so long a time from the enjoyment of their own appetites. In this posture, as I have been informed, remained the Nation, when a Captain called Abactanus , was sent from the usurping Senate, with competent Forces, either to suppress the Rebellion, or venture their Army; since no middle way of Pacification was to be desired, for that attonements were inconsistant as they thought with their purposes; knowing if they did not govern all, they should command nothing; in regard that as the Court would be encreased in number, whereby they should be alwayes out-voted, so the greatest persons of the Kingdom being brought into the House, their disabilities would be the sooner perceived; neither the interest of the Souldiers (whose intentions were alwayes to be well paid, or never disbanded) could not endure to hear of any authority, that durst either dispute their actions, or contradict their power; which they were sure the present Senate would never do, because their own Jurisdiction was onely rendred legal, by the countenance the Army had ever put upon their essence: For the Commander himself, it was not well understood, whether his spleen or his ambition was the greater; since as his Injunctions were ever for the most part sowre and unrelenting, so had he once before been the chief instrument to disposses the present Senators of their places, who had still continued the chief Majestracy in one single person, if Hercrombrotus had not endeavoured to have kept it alwayes in his own blood, whereby he became defrauded as he thought of his hopes to succeed; cause enough of suspition to the now Rulers, but that the necessity of the times would not give them leave, either to be peremptory, or dispute their Authorities, when he denied to march but upon his own conditions, being presumptuously confident, none was abler or more courageous then himself, and that knowledge gave him both opinion and boldness proper to such an exploit, that required as well haste as resolution; since any protraction could not but lose the Senates credit, and so consequently the Armies benefit, either of getting or governing, when seemingly they should be opposed by tumultuous risings; whether of the common people, or more considerable persons. Whilst these preparations were making ready for his march, the chief Magistrates of the City of Sardis (according to their claimed priviledges) assembled together their general Council, whereby to advise, as 'twas said, whether they should take part with the rising people, (who pretended they onely took up Arms for a new and free Senate) or still continue their obedience to the present Authority, though moulded as was pretended by the Armies violence; wherein the Subjects Liberties were altogether infringed, as their estates captivated, without any hope of remedy, or likelihood of restoration, but by such endeavours as were now practised: It was not long before the Senate had intelligence of these intentions; so that finding the cure was to be both sudden and sharp, in regard of the leading and dangerous examples to other places, presently sent Troops of Souldiers to surround the great Hall where they were sitting, not onely by their loud out-cryes to disturb their Conferences, but as they issued out of the Room to seize their persons: This being done, they brought them before Commissioners appointed for that purpose, which for the present, I may say, something quieted their intentions; however as it is thought nothing at all settled their minds; but rather like a flame allayed by the casting on of water, after breaketh out with more fury: Nevertheless this gave a better opportunity for Abactanus , to take his journey towards the rising people, who notwithstanding removed not far from their first station, finding neither the City nor the Countrey, to answer their expectation: 'Tis true a few dayes march in regard of the general haste, brought both Armies to a near distance, when of a sudden he was saluted with a Letter, that spake this language by way of expostulation, desiring with all it might be communicated or recommended to the Assembly.  If you think it strange to see us thus engaged in desperation, you may interpret it the onely effects of Loyalty to our Countrey, when both our fortunes and our lives, are put at the stake for that redemption, without hope of advancement by the bargain: If you judge us in the wrong, for taking up Arms in our hands, because we seem to strive against publick Authority, blame first your own proceedings in that particular, who invaded the like formerly, to comply with Hercrombrotus ambition; therefore our undertakings are to be excused, if yours be not to be condemned, since as we desire, without oppression, but to have the Senate restored; so your Dominion being tyrannical ought not to be continued, if the Subject may know, what Law he is to obey before he be condemned, for what was not yet made a crime to his undertakings: Blood we seek not, but our Liberty, freed absolutely from any usurpation: if we be supprest in these endeavours, let the Gods determine and punish the guilt, whilst we remain faithful, though injured Patriots in our profession. Tellanor and Timon .  The onely return to this Letter was, an offer of pardon for their lives, conditionally they yielded their Persons without their Estates; else to expect the fortune of a Battle, as the best reward they would give for their presumption: all which I received from the publick intelligence. But in the interim, whilst these things were acting in the Countrey, it was my chance being one day at the Syrian Ambassadours (who still kept his residence within the great City of Sardis , and many of his people professing the Heresian Religion) to be informed, not onely of your surprizing the Princess Cloria , at the Castle of Amarillia within the Territories of Pamphylia , but also of her release again before she arrived at Deorcas , performed by some Troops under the command of her Brother Arethusius (at leastwise Subjects belonging to the Kingdom of Lydia ) by which encounter (as I was more secretly told) young Manchinus the Nephew of our great Favourite Mazarius was certainly slain, whilst his Uncle was imployed in the Treaty of Peace, which for the present, had so enraged our Minister of State, that presently he desired audience of the Senate, offering more freely to comply in their occasions: however this is a particular, not yet openly published abroad, but rather whispered in corners of intelligence; since Nations do not use to make known to other Dominions, their own ill accidents; yet I thought it best (for your interest) to lay hold of the occasion, and by that new tendered friendship, to procure you the easier supplies of money, if not a larger Commission, whereby to keep the same correspondency (as formerly) within the Territories of the Syrian Monarchy; as well to give a countenance to those of the Heresian Religion, as also if it be possible, to hinder the unity now intended, between our King Orontes and Osiris the two mighty Princes of the world; which else probably must destroy all pretences, concerning the Worship of our Gods, with the priviledges of their Temples; and the rather for that you see, how violently the Flamins are bent, as well to our ruine as suppression. Here Garderius rested silent a while; but Locrinus suddenly striking his hand upon his breast, cryed out in this expression: O heavens (said he) what further fate belongs to those injured Princes, Arethusius and Cloria , that in so many dangers, and variety of fortunes, have been preserved, by the Gods omnipotency and goodness? after he continued a long time, as it were in a deep contemplation, until Garderius desired him to hear out, the short conclusion of his relation. The Armies (said he) as I told you before, being drawn together at a very near distance, could not be separate again without fighting; wherefore the rising people being sufficiently discouraged; not onely in regard of the peremptory answer sent them by the Senates General, but also finding there was neither pacification, or mercy to be expected from his proceedings, in a certain kinde of weak and confused manner, attempted the enemies Battalion with their Vanguard. In this conflict was instantly slaughtered the Captain, with a few others of his resolution; whilst the rest viewing the small Tragedy, without almost any ressiance at all, distractedly fled several wayes; as I may say, ending in this manner, a business, either ill grounded at the first, or weakly maintained in the conclusion: so that after I had understood all this at Sardis , and been an eye-witness of the taking prisoner of Tellanor , though Timon the other General was not yet heard of; I parted with as much haste as possible I could, contented enough for that I had effected your affairs, with a success according to my own wishes: In this posture I arrived after a small journey at the great City of Damascus , in hope there to have encountered you personally; but finding my expectation deceived, and understanding our King had appointed an assembly of his Subjects of our Religion in this City, whereby to defend their cause against the Flamins, I thought it my duty in some sort to be present at the meeting; whereby to give the best assistance I could to those people, either by counsel or interest, until I should understand the certain place of your abode. Although they continued together for some pretty space after this discourse, viewing of letters, and resolving of many several matters; yet Locrinus not to be too long absent from his companions, in regard of some duties, that were ordinarily to be performed by those Souldiers of the Kings company, at last took his leave of Garderius , after he had thanked him with many Syrian complements, not onely for the extraordinary pains he had taken in his concernments, but also in those present relations he had made towards his further satisfaction; promising him the next day again to meet in the same place, whereby the better to determine of the course they were to prosecute, since it was not probable that the Court would long remain in that City; but either remove nearer the borders of the Egyptian Monarchy, or return back again to the Town of Damascus . That night following Locrinus entred into consideration of his own affairs, being not much sorry upon better thoughts, that he Princess Cloria was freed from her restraint, since he had as he imagined, performed a service sufficient to the great Favourite Mazarius , whereby to continue him still in his affection, notwithstanding his Nephew Manchinus had been unfortunately destroyed in the attempt, occasioned by his own over-violent passion, wherefore doubted not of his welcome to the Court, when he should again return to his former imployment; which now he was in a better capacity to perform then heretofore, in regard both of his new Commission, and the supply of money from Sardis , procured by the painful endeavours of his trusty friend Garderius ; wherein the Heresian Religion also, as he believed, might receive countenance and strength, as well in the Kingdom of Syria , as in the Commonwealth of Lydia: He supposed withal, that the death of Manchinus , as it had already in part enflamed the Ambassadour at Sardis , to a new correspondency and communication with the Senate of Lydia , warranted thereunto by Mazarius principles; so did he hope, his own negotiations by reason of that particular, would finde better entertainment with the chief Councel, and every Minister of State within Orontes Dominions: so that he concluded absolutely to leave his present disguize, and assume to himself again his old shape, being fuller provided for all expences, any way conducing to that purpose; yet at the instant it became no small question in his thoughts, not onely how so suddenly he could free his person, from the obligation he had taken upon him as a Souldier, which he doubted would be strictly observed by his Captain, but also in what kinde he could without some circumstances, present himself to the King, having but very lately taken his leave, pretending many occasions for his absence: 'Tis true, this so much perplexed his minde at that time, that he left off any more contemplations thereof, until the next opportunity, that he should encounter again with his companion, at the place appointed without the walls of the Town; where both meeting accordingly, after he had acquainted Garderius with his difficulties, he was quickly instructed by his apprehension in this manner: That upon the Kings parting from the City, either to make some other perambulations about the Countrey, or to return to his own Royal station, within brave and flourishing Damascus , he might easily feign himself sick of some desperate disease, which hindred him for the present to march with the rest of the guard; whereby a discharge might be procured thereupon for his absence, or at leastwise a long suspension from his service, until he should be better recovered of his health; when being by this means freed from his present obligation, and staying some time amongst those of the Heresian Religion for his better accommodation, he might take upon him his wonted posture as Ambassadour; and in an equipage answerable to his place and employment, beginning his journey immediately towards the Confines of both Kingdoms, where the two Favourites were treating in matters of peace between all the Princes of the lesser Asia , in which number, as Garderius said, the considerable Commonwealth of Lydia ought to be included, as well for Civil Jurisdiction, being now in amity with the Syrian Monarchy, as concerning their formal Worship of the Gods, when so many of Orontes Subjects professed no other Ceremony and belief. It was not long after this discourse, before Locrinus put in execution what himself and friend had designed, intending thereby to make the Heresian Religion, the seeming period of his intentions, accompanied by the interest of his present masters, the great and fortunate Senate of Lydia , that in their own thoughts began again to over-awe the world: But Locrinus being a Myssian by birth, and so consequently not onely cunning in his intentions, but passionate in his concernments, resolved notwithstanding, to play his own game, most advantageable for his particular profit, either with Mazarius the Syrian Favourite, or any other that could best assist his purposes; believing withall, the formal Worship of the Gods, consisted in opinion, rather then in essence, when the Heavens appointed people, as he thought, to follow their occasions, without troubling themselves with conscionable and unnecessary scruples, that served for nothing but to hinder actions, and stop resolution. But being in the way towards the designs he intended, as he travelled, having leasure enough for contemplation, if not opportunity for other divertisements of the minde, he entred oftentimes upon these considerations of Lydia's Government, admiring with what a strange and precipitate fate, the Senate for some years past had prosecuted their successes against all manner of persons that they contended withall, though there was in themselves, neither principles by education, or experience by continuance, whereby to have contracted a sufficient knowledge or understanding fit for Dominion; yet had notwithstanding still the fortune to prevail, not onely by their Arms, but in their Negotiations, with the wisest and most powerfullest Councels, without money, friends, or the peoples affection: Besides being confused and uncertain in their determinations; and nevertheless with a small Army, to have captivated three mighty Kingdoms against a Prince, whose Title hath not been controverted by any thought or pen in the world, no more then is his worth and courage suspected by the sharpest scrutiny: All this to be effected not so much by the spightful endeavours of his worst enemies, as by the compliance of those of his nearest blood, who in all other actions but his assistance, make glory their onely maxime; as one would say, hazzarding Crowns and Empires, rather then any of their least Allye should perish, if not be frustrate in their expectations; whilst of the contrary in Arethusius behalf, neither Contracts of marriage are observed, or competent subsistance procured, in lieu of those vaste Territories extorted, with an unexampled insolence from his possession, against all foundation of honour; to an example as dangerous for their Government, as lamentable in his particular. After these considerations, he cryed, You Gods, when I think of these circumstances, I cannot but condemn, either your Justice or your Power, and yet reflecting upon the impossibility of chance, to be the contriver of those actions, I must admire your omnipotency; however as yet I am wholly confounded in the thoughts, both of the period and the intention, since as I confess they pass my understanding, so in the consequence they seem preposterous; and stranger it is to be imagined, that the Syrian Monarchy should be so preposterous in its victories, and so renowned for their actions, in being punctual in the restoration of Prince Cassianus , to all the lost Territories of his Father, without which they refused peace with the great King of Armenia , though nothing of kindred or interest belonged to the favour, and totally abandon the Rights of young Arethusius , descended from the same stock of Orontes Ancestors; especially thereunto being obliged, both by conditions and honour; when they promised to see Queen Hyacinthia his Mother established in all those Dignities and Titles, formerly appertaining to Euarchus predecessors: No certainly this cannot be, without mens infatuation, and the worlds utter dissolution; wherefore some mysterious designs onely lockt up in the wise Favourites bosome, must be the conclusion of these now seeming prodigies; since Lydia's stupid sensuality hath merited the Heavens worst punishment, though for the present people appear blinded with such a security, as foreshews rather a patience in the Gods sufferance, then a pardon for mens offences. Although Locrinus , as I say, often expostulated in his thoughts these unseasonable passages, calling sometimes in question the very nature of the great Deity it self, whose attributes should be alwayes just and powerful, yet at last by degrees he was content (wearied with overmuch speculation) to let fall his own considerations; in the interim resolving notwithstanding any alteration, or danger of future condemnation, to follow on his begun determinations, both of advancement and profit; present enjoyments as it should seem of sensual things, being next his frailty, either shadowed by clouds of interposition, or seeming too far off from his possession; so that he fully determined to speed his intention towards the Favourites abode, where he resolved (making use of his Commissions) either to procure the knowledge of more interest, or prosecute what was already commanded him from Sardis: Accompanied with these cogitations, I say, he travelled some dayes journey, without any adventure at all considerable, to that place where the Worlds controversies (if not confusions) seemed to be in arbitration, as it were, hanging yet upon so unsettled a balance, that peoples mindes were still tottering, between fear and hope, notwithstanding the relation of the issue, that had been made at Orontes Court, until one afternoon alighting by the side of a Wood, being invited thereunto either by some desire of ease, after his hard riding, or covetous of a natural refreshment; since a green walk covered with many Trees, appeared as a fair protector against the present heat of the season: but not long he contemplated that pleasure, e're at the further end he might perceive a Lady sitting, encompassed about with a convenient Train, which shewed as she was of some quality, so probably remained there upon the same occasion; wherefore Locrinus marching in a kinde of a slow pace to the place where she was, as if accident and not design put on the boldness, he addressed himself to her presence, with an intention to be further acquainted, either by her necessities or civilities: nevertheless approaching at a distance, that could discern countenance, he perceived her to be the fair Amarillia , whose Castle he had formerly surprized: As this unexpected encounter made him a little retire, not willing to be known by the person whom he had so lately injured, yet upon better resolution, considering the posture he was then in, could not probably be any motive towards his discovery; especially for that the attempted force had been in the night season, he began to take to himself more courage concerning his first resolution, having belike a higher passion then before to be satisfied, since he doubted not, but to be made certain of the Princess Cloria's escape, as well as with the fate or misfortune of Manchinus ; so that with a Syrian confidence, which he had procured by his long continuance at that Court, he saluted her with a low obeysance, and then accosted her in this manner. Lady, said he, if my intrusion be distasteful to your privacy, I willingly submit my self to a penance answerable to my fault; though accident of travel I hope may something warrant my excuse, the rather in these Countreys, where the rigidness of jealousie never had any countenance; but of the contrary, all honest and civil conversation between what sexes soever, commonly is entertained, not onely with a competent, but with a gracious acceptance; provided they be both discreet and seasonable: however Amarillia a little blushed at this sudden surprize to be so saluted by a stranger she knew not, yet having a becoming behaviour ingrafted in her, by the force and decorum of continual education, accompanied by the addition of her own ready wit, was not long before she returned him this answer. Sir, said she, (in the interim rising to him with a civil respect) although I cannot challenge to my self the honour of being of these Countreys, where it is well known dwelleth so many examples of Bravery and Courtship, that are not accustomed to be spotted, either with jealousie or suspicion; yet those parts that have given me both birth and education, (I thank the Gods) have imprinted such maximes in my thoughts, that I cannot doubt an ill I do not see; for that my charity alwayes commands the best opinion, though heretofore I have suffered (perhaps) too much for that innocency: But to give you at present a testimony, that my intentions go along with my words (if your occasion or your haste will give you leave) I shall desire you to take a share in this unhandsome seat, until the time of the day will afford you a new conveniency for travel, as my self also who am journeying towards the borders of Egypt to the general Treaty, where my business lies, both in my thoughts and endeavours. As Locrinus was something taken with this free, however modest reply, so was he no way backward to enter into possession of the favour, not doubting ere long to know more particulars; whilst in the mean time all the company dispersed to several divertisements, as if they had been instructed in their Ladies principles; but when they were gone, Locrinus began another discourse in this manner. Madam, said he, if civilities may not be destroyed by too many exactions, as you have already been pleased to open your design in the general, concerning the period of your journey, to which place my self in like manner by good fortune am travelling; so hope I to do you service in the way, if my company shall not be unpleasing to your acceptance; wherefore to make my intentions more effectual, I pray you let me know something better, the condition of your affairs at the present, since I must profess my own curiosity, to be excessive passionate to that purpose, seeing your person, and conjecturing your vertues, that consequently cannot but prenosticate to my apprehension a weightiness of the cause you go about to effect, in that station of controversie; for that it is conceived, businesses of no other nature are treated of in that place, unless it be some private Articles between the two Kings, reserved peculiarly for both the Favourites to determine. Amarillia with another modest blush, quickly returned him this answer; as it were, shewing by that change of countenance, that although she had no guilt of any great measure, yet doubting the apprehensions of a stranger, upon that ticklish subject she was to treat upon, she could not chuse but be a little moved, before she began her story; which notwithstanding being over, she said in this manner: The confidence I have of your patience, and the unseasonableness of the time of the day for travel, might embolden me to make a large relation of my fortunes, if any thing could be told (in my particular) tending to your satisfaction; yet because many other things of publick concernment, will be mingled necessarily with my discourse, and you seeming to oblige me to the office, I shall rather comply with the hazzard of not edifying your minde, then any way appear obstinate concerning the request: wherefore, such as it is, Sir, take it, as onely belonging to your commands. After that Locrinus had thanked her with some complements for her intended favour, she entered into her task in this sort; first beautifying her countenance with a pretty smile. The Countrey of Pamphylia , said she, knows my Birth, Breeding, and Estate, though my own faults my misfortunes, if my too much credulity cannot in some sort plead an excuse, joyned with youth, and a womans ambition, incident to our selves; but more particularly now to the matter, since over many circumstances do but seem tedious to the healer, especially being up way concerned in the fate: It was my chance to be courted by a Prince named Astratius , whose beauty and other endowments of nature, might have challenged the best respects from any Lady, that marriage could have pretended unto, if his truth had been answerable to his protestations; which failing in the sequel, it slubbered all the rest of his perfections, either of sovereignty or descent, riches appeacing the meanest of his attributes; for that oppression had already injur'd his right of Dominion: 'Tis true, it was my unhappiness, too soon to be overcome by his perswasions, being not cautious enough to seek after other testimonies, (or rather fearing to be deprived either by accidents or his own inconstancy) before I became his Wife by most solemn and publick Nuptials; which continued us in some prosperity for a year or two, until it came to my ears by common fame, that he was already married to another woman; whose quality, as it appear'd, could not possibly dispence, either with the injury or the disgrace; wherefore a divorce was soon procured from the great Flamin of Delphos , that continued us asunder, though living still in one Town, until he was carried prisoner into Egypt ; in the interim my self retiring to a Castle of my own, whilst his pretended Wife and my Rival, departed this life at the famous City of Damascus ; which again I must confess something revived my hopes: But during the time I waited in that privacy, the best occasion again to renew my old pretentions, (the obstacle now as I conceived being removed) I was in my own house surprized by a party of horse, composed of Syrian and Lydian Forces; however the design as we conjectured afterward, was chiefly intended to become Masters of the Princess Cloria , who then remained securely, as we thought, in my poor habitation: Nevertheless we had not made many dayes march in that captived posture, but were again released by the valiant endeavours of some Troops, under the jurisdiction of Arethusius , young King of Myssia , though then commanded by his Excellent Brother the Lord Ascanius , that quickly put our conductors into such a confusion, wherein most part of them, either lost their lives or their liberties by the service; by which means the Princess her self, was freed from her former restraint, unto the company and conversation of her eldest Brother; for whose sake she hade made a journey, out of the Kingdom of Syria into the Countrey of Pamphylia , with other Territories belonging to the King of Egypts Government, since the alliance made between Hercrombrotus and the Syrian State, had banished him personally from Orontes Court: After this for my own particular, I retired again to my accustomed home, where I continued until I was made acquainted (if not perswaded) a new King of Armenia being chosen, my best way would be to make my Address, to the Councel he had lately established near the great River of Euphrates , to hear the complaints of all wronged persons of quality; wherefore conceiving my Lords imprisonment (he being a Prince belonging to that Kingdom) and my own injurious and unfortunate marriage, to be causes of extraordinary consequence, and no way to be relieved but by eminent and supream authority, I soon took a journey into those parts, (enflamed with some hopes) that if I could procure my Husband (for I must ever call him so, since heaven was witness to the contract) a release, from his present and sharp imprisonment, under the jurisdiction of the mighty Monarch of Egypt , gratitude or religion, would make him mindful of his former protestations, when he called the Gods as testimonies of his love and perpetual fidelity, never to be broken (as he said) on his part for the worlds Empire. With these words poor Amarillia began to shed a few tears, whilst Locrinus had leasure to contemplate his own actions, though not discovered as yet according to her relation; but long she gave him not leave to consider upon that subject, since quickly she returned again to her story in this manner. The several adventures of that journey (said she) I shall not need to particularize, onely in some weeks time I arrived at the place designed, where I found the Councel so imbroiled in publick affairs, appertaining to the Kingdom of Armenia , that no private complaint (as I was told) could possibly be heard, which had much discouraged my enterprize, if patience, either by custom or nature, had not proved my greatest vertue: The businesses that most took up the cares of those eminent Lords were, about the conservation and prosperity of the Countrey belonging to their own King, being ready to be troubled, if not invaded by many enemies; which was the onely cause, why the releasement of Astratius from his Egyptian imprisonment, could not so soon be thought upon; much less any hearing given to my conscionable complaints, though they continued me in that posture, daily attending longer then I expected, until at last something wearied with over soliciting, being not formerly accustomed to those practices, and not knowing when or how, I might have a full end of my Petitions, I was perswaded to depart the Town, having first procured a letter from that Princely Assembly, in favour of Astratius person, directed to Osiris great King of Affrica , that he would be pleased, either out of compassion to his prisoner, who was by birth of their society, or in respect of the friendship and service, formerly shewed by the Armenian State, to the House and Family of mighty Osiris , to release him speedily from his bonds, putting in security to be alwayes true to his principles: This I must tell you, is the onely occasion of my present journey, towards the place where the two Favourites are, treating of a general peace, the substance as I conceive being a subject proper for their justice or their mercy; and the more probable as I believe to be obtained, in regard as I understand, both the Kings themselves are at a very near distance, to the borders of each Dominions. With these words lovely Amarillia finished her discourse, accompanied by a few passionate tears, trickling down her fair, though something decayed cheeks, which however, did no way either disbecome her person, or much discompose her behaviour. Scarce had Amarillia arrived to the end of her complains, attended by some other circumstances, when her ancient Steward coming again to the place where they rested, gave her notice of the time of the day, being commodious now (as he said) for a new journey, since the Sun had abated much of his former heat, which afforded no conveniency at all for Locrinus to make any reply, much less to ask her any other questions concerning Manchinus death; so that presently taking horse, they put themselves onely in a posture for travel: Nevertheless taking leave by the scantling of her first civilities, he intended to wait upon her, as far as her permissions would give him occasion or encouragement; not doubting by those opportunities, to be better acquainted, both with her own particular, and the passages of the Princess Cloria's escape, though he intended to be very cautious, in discovering any thing, either of his person (having relation to that action) or his further designs (concerning King Arethusius affairs) though he could not well cover his quality, in being an Ambassadour, imployed by the State of Lydia ; however for matters of trade and commerce, onely between both Nations. With these fancies and resolutions, he communed with Amarillia on the way; sometimes of one thing, and sometimes of another, mingling his discourses with raileries for the purpose, to render his company and conversation more pleasing, if not delightful to her apprehension, wherein he found her replies alwayes sharp and witty, which at last began exceedingly to work upon his nature and affections; differing little from wilde motions and appetites of love (kindled oftentimes in a Myssian breast to considerable flames, when other covetous designs do not allay the fire) encouraged also in his thoughts to some attempts; for that it was not long since he had buried the former Wife, that Hercrombrotus had bestowed upon his condition, to make him the surer to his own principles; by which means as he believed, he was absolutely free to what courtships or engagements soever, could be proposed to his liking. It was something late notwithstanding before they arrived at their lodging, the way proving more tedious then was expected; so that Amarillia being a little tired with her long journey, or rather perhaps not willing at the first sight, to have overmuch seeming familiarity with strangers, assoon as she alighted from her horse (having saluted all the company) presently retired into her designed Chamber, pretending the hard voyage she had made that afternoon, gave her no appetite to her supper, but rather as she said, more properly to see if her bed could refresh her spirits, whereby to render her the more capable of enduring the next dayes travel: This also gave occasion to Locrinus to do the like, not thinking it convenient for one in his imployment, to mingle his conversation with the attendance of any other person, since the Lady her self was absent; either out of state or modesty, calling in the interim for some slight accommodation, to be made ready for his own particular, with which he went to his intended rest also. But being on his Couch for repose, whether the little God Cupid began to play something too violently in his imagination, or his own weariness took from him (though it afforded him the appetite) the effects of sleep, he could not by any means close his eyes, in the interim tossing over many fancies and chymera's in his troubled brain; amongst which number at last, he more settledly fell upon these considerations, or rather may I call them desires, since his will certainly consented to what was figured in his more confused thoughts; first the advantages he might procure to himself, if he could but win Amarillia to a liking of his person, for that he esteemed her other pretentions onely toyes, that delighted her sense, but destroyed her reason; in that as Astratius could not be accounted her lawful husband, being otherwise obliged when that contract was made, so was it no way probable to any thought he could now entertain her as a new Mistress, having lost much of that beauty by years, that in her youth enflamed his love to those unwarrantable tryals, that brought Amarillia all her crosses, if not unhappy fortunes, so much at present complained of by her particular; besides men without predominate compulsions, seldom or never espouses those parties of whom they have gathered already the chief flowers of their beauty; when as they cannot but fear they may prove too kinde to others, and themselves not possibly to expect any more at the present, then what they have heretofore enjoyed; since Nuptials onely depend upon gain or opinion, if once the sacred laws of marriage are broken, seeing doubtfull it will be whose issue shall inherit: Next for Amarillia's estate as he thought it would be inconsiderable to Astratius quality; which circumstances made him believe, that she could not prevail in her suit, whereby to make good her contract; much less to perswade her Lord (as she called him) to comply anew with her desires, although she should procure him a release by those Letters, she had brought with her from the great Assembly, of all the chief Princes of Armenia . By these consequences he nourished many fantastical thoughts, tending either to the satisfaction of his senses, or the advancement of his condition; and to that purpose resolved to make use of his possession gained in the Haven of Deorcas , to be delivered to the Egyptians upon a considerable composition of money, thereby to win the favour of Osiris towards his desired marriage, if he could but procure the liking of Amarillia to his person; to which purpose he intended to sollicite her in the journey: Such are the extravagant fancies of humane nature, when carried on by violent passions of covetousness or ambition, seeing in all reason he might very well doubt of any success; for that as it was probable the high birth of Amarillia could not be brought to so low a choice, so would not the enflamed spirit of King Osiris (having made a lasting peace with Orontes ) descend to a Treaty for what was against his honour to compass, otherwise then by conquest and compulsion; but more stupid to think his own natural Subject (who had all her subsistance in his Territories) would marry with a dependant upon another State that had most affronted both his glory and his greatness, in the very interim whilst an Ambassadour of Correspondency was remaining yet at the City of Sardis. Locrinus with the pleasingness of these imaginations at last fell asleep, and so continued until the morning sun gave him and the rest warning to provide for another journey; but whilst he was preparing with his followers for his best accommodation, he was advertised by a messenger from Amarillia , that as her own present indisposition of body would not suffer her for two or three dayes to part from the Inn, in regard she intended by the advice of some Physicians in the Town, to take convenient remedies before she began any other voyages, so might he be pleased to think of his own departure without her company; whose society already she held her self obliged to repay, by what civilities in honour, she was able to perform towards his particular. As Locrinus was a little startled at this unexpected resolution, wherein his hopes in a manner became blasted, so could he not but suspect exceedingly, that the Lady had gotten some private intelligence of his quality; either from the babling discourse of his own servants in the house, or by the remembrance of his countenance when he surprized her Castle; which had wrought in her disposition, as he might believe, a certain kinde of revenge instead of application; however he resolved with a Myssian confidence, (that seldom is wanting in people of that Nation) to try if he could yet work upon her pretended constancy, so far as, either to change her minde, or discover her intelligence; since he was confident enough it was design and not sickness, that had made her now put off her journey: 'Tis true upon his admittance into her Chamber, she used him with a civil though reserved respect, nevertheless so much altered (according to the precipitation of his own fancy) from her freedom the day before, that he quickly took his leave of the room, with a certain kinde of cloud in his countenance, not differing much from the appetites (if not intentions) of revenge; belike supposing by his cunning or his power, he could either cross or hinder her business, in regard of his conceived interest, in the great Favourite of Syria's opinion, especially concerning the Territories and Countrey of the now imprisoned Austratius , being within the compass of his Jurisdiction; and the rather, for that he had alwayes shewed himself an enemy to the unity between Hercrombrotus and Mazarius , in the defence of the Pamphilian Dominion: With these thoughts, I say, he mounted his horse, leaving Amarillia , either to dissemble her present indisposition, or to wait a better occasion for her travel; in this manner directing his journey according as he first intended, towards the Court of glorious Orontes , where he arrived without any considerable adventures, being joyful in his Commissions, and confident of his Authority, although something vexed inwardly, for the conceived, or misconceived affront he had sustained. But when he entred the Town where the Court remained, he found it flaming all over with fires of joy, whilst there was not an Altar but smoaked with incense, the Priests in the interim doing their offices in their best attire, before the Statues of some Gods or other, adorned with flowers and divers rich Jewels: These Ceremonies gave Locrinus thoughts some occasion of wonder, however it was not long before he was advertised, that the day being the time of the Kings birth, the people with the inhabitants of the City had ordained those feasts, in token of their Loyalty to their Prince; which not onely fully satisfied his curiosity, but retired his weariness for the present, not thinking the season would be proper for any addresses; since businesses were not to be mingled with divertisements, though his passion to put in execution his new authority, provoked his fancy to some visits that night, at leastwise to those he conceived to be of his own faction: Nevertheless upon better consideration he put off his desires, until the next morning should give him a more fit commodity, when going to the lodging of one of the Kings Councellours, as he found him something cold in his entertainment, so did he tell him, it was to little purpose yet to expect audience, since Orontes was not onely violently in the thoughts of his daily exercises, (which he intended to continue for some weeks space) but also in regard that all his great Officers would be busied about the Articles of Peace, that they could not give themselves any leasure, to think of meaner concernments: Although Locrinus departed with this unexpected answer, carrying in his countenance a certain kinde of frowning cloud, as if he meant to fright the Councellors with threats to a readier compliance, such as formerly he had found, yet hoping e're long, to obtain better correspondency, notwithstanding the troublesomeness of affairs, went instantly into his own appartament; as it were fancying accident and not design was the obstacle: But when he was there retired, and obscured by the night season, he mustered up in his imagination several passages of his Embassie; until at last he thought it was a wrong piece of policy of the State of Lydia , to have made such a peace with the Syrian Kingdom, whereby an utter breach was procured to Egypts Monarchy, since by that means Mazarius was likely to obtain what conditions he pleased within Osiris Dominions; and so by reason of that accord, become more potent to work Lydia's overthrow; each Nation having pretensions sufficient, either for an Invasion or a Conquest, both complying with the Senate but for their own ends and private interest; differing not onely in Religion, and outward Ceremonies appertaining to the Gods Worship, but thwarting one another in all Maximes belonging to the foundation of Government; especially Egypt being injured by the Lydian Commonwealth, and Syria out of honour obliged to demand Queen Hyacinthia's restitution; whereas if Hercrombrotus had kept those two Princes still in an equal ballance of contention, Lydia in all probability would have been the chief umpire between their concernments; besides the commodity of trading from each jurisdictions, being also accompanied with many other advantages, which the desired friendship both sides would have procured: of the contrary by taking part with either interest, the other is forced to a peace, and so by consequence become united together, to the prejudice (if not revenge) of unfortunate Lydia , that none can ever pitty, or any will assist, considering those affronts that have been offered to all; besides what titles are yet on foot, concerning Arethusius pretentions. However Locrinus , according to those instructions he had received lately from Sardis , was diligent enough to solicite his affairs, principally to have some honourable audience, whereby the world might not take too much notice, of his declining credit with the Syrian State, belike conceiving, that generally people are taken, rather with glorious semblances, then with real actions, since the one appears to outward sense, and the other is clouded for the most part to common apprehensions; yet could he not possible procure the least reception, although covered sometimes either with complements or deceits; for young Orontes being inflamed by his courage, had appointed a general muster of all the gallant Lords of his Court, (being about his own years, in a certain kinde of warlike preparation, to attempt the taking of a Fort, raised artificially with five Bastions for the Kings exercise; at which sport the Queen with most of the Ladies were summoned to be present, whereby to give greater vigour, and better life to their endeavours. In order to this noble exercise, presently the Flags were set up, and the Trumpets sounded to the assault; each party performing such actions before his Mistriss, as most suited with youth and dexterity; nevertheless sometimes winning and sometimes losing, as occasion served, or fortune prevailed; until at last the King himself, being bravely plumed for the more Majesty of his person, marched hastily with his own band of Souldiers, to attempt what the other had failed to perform, although not for want of valour but miss of success; since there lacked neither resolution or wanted activity in their attempts, being alwayes gallantly repulsed by contrary endeavours, who besides their courages had the rampers for their defence; so that representing the worlds unresistible Monarch, himself came up to the trench with such violence, that instantly the fortification (casting down their Ensigns) yielded without any conditions, where he was presently received as chief Lord and Conquerour: When this was fully performed (leading the chief Officers in triumph) he gave order to have the Castle set on fire, after he had presented his Victories to Andromida , by whose gentleness they all soon obtained pardon. The finishing of this dayes sports gave Locrinus (at which he had been a concealed spectator) some hope of a speedy admittance into his presence; nevertheless he was answered as before, that the King could not yet be at leasure, who intended first as they said, to offer a solemn sacrifice to the Gods, which within a weeks space being prepared, he performed after this manner. The chief Temples of the City to this purpose were commanded to be adorned with their best furniture, where the Statue of some God or other was set upon every Altar, before which Incense was continually burning, accompanied with such Musick, as was most proper for the service; afterward the Priests were assembled in the Fane of Janus , from whence they conduct the King to the great sacrifice: This being finished, not onely in a magificent but a religious procession, Orontes with his Mother were the first with lighted Tapers, that gave fire to the offerings, whilst in the interim dainty boyes with excellent voices seemed like Cupids to carry up their prayers to Olympus , mixed with fervent desires between love and peace; in that manner beseeching the Gods to render their endeavour propitious to the world, that had been for so many years disquieted with blood and slaughter; after which Andromida and Orontes with their eyes cast down upon the earth, modestly returned to to their seats, and there rested, untill a grave Flamin mounted on a Throne, (wearing a silver Mytre upon his head) made this Oration. Me thinks, said he, I see the Heavens smile at these blessed Sacrifices, but more confident I am the Gods triumph when Princes do accord; Crowns and Diadems should aspire to end in peace, and rest in security, as nature and charity ought to be linked together for preservation, and not towards destruction, since all defections are either ominous or dishonourable; but to you most glorious King let me say, Tropheys of Victory hang upon your youthful brow; having more conquest by your sword, then years in your person, yet greater will be your fame by this intended Jubile, then if the whole earth had stooped to your subjection; for thereby you have conquered both your appetite and your fortune: 'Tis true, that Justice and Mercy are two properties of such sublime authority, that if it were possible they should out-live eternity it self, in that they are of a participating quality to be distributed, whereas the others in essence cannot be communicated to any: O let the Temple of Janus be ever closed within the bounds of the Syrian Monarch, being drest over continually with Olive branches, that other Countreys (gathering sprigs from those productions) may learn to flourish with the like wisdom, striving for nothing but the right Worship of the Gods, and in that Worship be onely prosperous, until the greatest heaven consumates all to a perpetual period of happiness, never to be ended by time or chance; and in the interim, may your own approaching Nuptials be propitious in the success, as sacred in the conjunction, and blessed at the conclusion; whereby you may leave a Race after you to govern powerfully, though more by Religion then will; so commanding the Laws, as none of them be obstructed, but when justifiable pitty is in question to be distributed. Next to you most mighty Queen of this happy Empire, whose unparallel'd prudence, hath not onely protected your Sons Dominions, from all the machinations, that either ambition or malice could enterprize, with such a duty belonging to the heavens, that compelled even the Gods to be your faithful friends, but also now have joyned together both your blood and interst, (appearing formerly at some enmity) whereby to render the power of each unconquerable; by which means you also have procured a happiness, that nature with her rigid'st production cannot but admire, since the influence may be esteemed beyond her capacity to conceive, much less to imitate; in that all those National Antipathies heretofore thwarting one another, appear now buried or taken away in your conjunction; for that Towns and Countreys of either side are contented, to be under whose Government you shall please to appoint; believing some Deity will be their protector, although Asia and Affrica be under several constellations: Wherefore great Madam, go on confidently in this mighty and stupendious work, that nothing can exceed in glory, but the last fruition of a starry Crown, which is to be obtained by such acts onely; whilst the fresh flowers of you blood and piety, may here from one generation to another orderly succeed, until you all together meet in Olympus , to people more abundantly that delicious mansion; where you may govern without pains, and have without trouble, leaving behinde you nothing but famous examples: To this effect, may all the Altars of the Syrian Empire, perpetually smoke with the purest incense can be found, as the Temples be ever filled with suppliants pious and devout, to offer sacrifices without intermission, towards the accomplishment of those felicities, we not onely hope for, but expect. Although these complementing ceremonies, ended in some sort Orontes devotion at the instant, because the time of the day gave not more conveniency for the Gods Service, yet could not Locrinus (notwithstanding) finde any leasure, whereby to have his desired audience; for that the King resolved upon new entertainments, which put the Ambassadour into such fumes, that he determined to leave the Court shortly: besides Andromida had appointed with her choice Ladies, to behold the equipage of a gallant person called Gratanus , who was ordered to go into Egypts Territories with Letters to salute the Kings new Mistress: Insomuch as Locrinus (as I said) having not patience sufficient for a Statesmans profession, though perhaps too much sufferance for a Souldiers courage, of a sudden departed towards that place upon the Confines; hoping there to become more effectual, at leastwise less disrespected, whilst in the interim the designed Duke of Tyrus , appeared thus prepared for his voyage, before a great assembly of people near the Kings Palace, as if provided by nature for such a parrado. The first Troop that entered the Field, consisted of a hundred young Gentlemen well mounted, and so apparelled, that however they might be known to belong to one service, yet the rare invention and colour of their habits, shewed diversity of fancies had conquered in the intention, though all seeming notwithstanding to agree in diversity; either by figures or application; for as some appeared to exceed in richness, the others made it up in beauty; as if they had consulted one with another to be different, and yet to be all of the same minde as to excellency: Each had two Staffiers that carried their Lances, clothed for distinction in the Liveries of their masters; which was to be known onely by the necessary bearing of their Arms, according to the antiquity, and precedency of their houses, that also ordered them in their marches, until they came before the Kings Throne; when separating themselves upon a sudden (having performed a short obeysance) they reduced the whole in two ranks, to give convenienter place for other companies. The next that appeared in the shew were four and twenty Pages riding two by two, clad all in yellow cloth of gold, their habits being made after the fashion of short Trunk-hose, paned on the out-side with green Sattin, as also cut into the resemblance of Lawrel Branches, which covering a little the ground of the materials, might be compared to a shining tree, obscured by nature with verdant leaves; or rather boughs growing out of a transparent body; when their upper parts also being drest in the same manner (however more regularly) gave both beauty and gallantry to their youth; they wore helmets upon their heads enamelled, being cut out into the form of fiery Dragons, scaled over with a bright mixture of the same, gave their flaxen hair beauty, playing most becomingly over their fair faces, as either action or the winde afforded the occasion: The onely weapons they carried were silver Bowes in their hands, with embroidered Quivers at their backs, tied about their shoulders by watchet ribbons: Between each rank was led, one of the Dukes horses of the Scythian breed, every one differing in colour though not in shape. After these Gratanus himself appeared, more marshal in his countenance then courtly in his behaviour, although at present elected for the last execution; his habit was rather rich then gawdy, being more resplendent in Jewels, then brave in materials; knowing that true greatness consists, chiefly in what others cannot compass easily; however he wore a curious mantle, with a comely though careless garb tied in a knot upon his left shoulder; which shewed, he rather disvalued effeminate softness, then that he knew not how to use it. As he was accompanied by many of the Nobility, who were to go with him the same journey; so about his own person particularly were thirty Staffiers, clad all in yellow damask, fitted so close to their bodies, that little question could be made of their shape, though much of their complexion, since silken Ivy artificially wrought, seemed to embrace them in the manner of wilde hunters, carrying each one a guiled Javelin in his hand: This conceit of their Lord was more wondred at by all, then rightly understood by any, though the prospect appeared both quaint and pleasing; which with three rich Chariots, drawn by six horses a piece, finished the shew, though not the ceremony; for the Duke alighting from his horse, presently went to kiss the Kings hands. Assoon as Gratanus approached the foot of Orontes Throne, (putting himself upon his knee) in a gallant, though short speech, thanked him for his favours, for having chosen him amongst so many of his great Subjects, to be the first instrument of those Nuptials, that would not onely revive the buried world from the embers of its destruction, like the young Phoenix from the Suns influence, but also people it again probably by such vertues, that the Gods should be served, with more magnificent Rites, to the perpetual conjunction of two Crowns, that would divide the earth between them in power. But as he was further proceeding though more like a Souldier then an Oratour, conceiving the one to be his profession, and the other but his recreation, Queen Andromida with a graceful smile told him, that as she knew the King expected no complements from his integrity, being confident both of his heart and duty, so would she onely lay this injunction upon his employment, to promise her Neece in her name, that as the Kingdom of Syria was to be her dower, the Flamins prayers should be her felicity, and the peoples affections her interest: When these passages were finished, Orontes appearing pleased as well with his equipage as his person, caused his principal Secretary in his own presence, to deliver him his Letters of trust and direction, accompanied also with such a chain of pearl, to be presented to his Royal Mistress, as might have served to redeem the world from captivity: Gratanus after this, having with some circumstances taken his leave of the whole Court, being on his way, nevertheless began to consider, that it was necessary for him to have his last instructions, from the pleasures of the great Favourite, whose wisedom he knew governed the Sphere of all Syria's Transactions; not onely because he was exceedingly obliged to his affections, but lest any omission of his should destroy, though not the essence, yet the honour of his employment; since Mazarius had been the eminent Machyne, to move the mighty affairs in hand, and could not want ambition enough in his nature, to have it so thought by the world; (Ministers of State, for the most part, doing nothing but either for gain or reputation) wherefore determined to send the number of his Train before him by easie journeys, to work their own commodities, resolved himself with a few attendants onely, by a more quick passage, to seek out and salute the Favourite in his station, who was then in communication with the other Minion, as he thought, or retired for his better recreation to some other place of refreshment. At his arrival there he found Mazarius busied in hearing the complaints of Amarillia , concerning her contract and marriage with Prince Astratius , whose liberty she had newly procured, by those Letters she had brought out of Armenia , from that noble Assembly; however her Lord and pretended Husband, neither expressed any gratitude to her endeavour, nor was willing to afford her much satisfaction; so that the poor Lady upon these occasions, was fallen extream sick; grief and perturbation having in a manner totally expressed her weak spirits, which nevertheless stirred up little pitty, and less affection in that uncertain Politician, who made his own appetites the period of his intentions; that shews when man falls into sin by frailty, he seldom recovers his former vertue again, but by open repentance; which being neglected, a thousand desperations follow the fate, notwithstanding any motive or perswasion: But Mazarius (who now was resolved to render his name glorious, by superlative actions of Honour and Justice) made a decree, that if Astratius would not conform himself to Rules of Piety and Religion, he should not be restored to his ancient possessions: This being determined, without alteration the Duke of Tyrus had the more conveniency, to be admitted to many private Conferences with this excellent Statesman, whose fame began now to triumph, not onely through all the Territories of the lesser Asia , but also over most part of the known world; a messenger being dispatched to the great Flamin of Delphos , to make him acquainted with these particulars, as well to receive from his Sanctity a Benediction, answerable to the proceedings, as to give him the prime honour both of the Marriage and the Peace; since as it was believed, those continual Sacrifices he had made to that purpose, had drawn from the Heavens a propitious aspect upon the earth, towards finishing the exasperated differences, that had been between the two Kingdoms for so long a time: But Gratanus one day being with the Favourite in his Chamber, thinking to take the last farewell for his intended journey, towards the Regal City of Thebes in Egypt , where the King then remained, Mazarius after he had commanded some of his Pages that attended him to withdraw, being seated both together upon his bed, he entertained him with this serious discourse. My Lord, said he, as I have ever esteemed you, not onely a lover of my person, but a follower of my principles, which have still been as you know, to advance the honour and prosperity of the Syrian Monarchy, though oftentimes misinterpreted by the ambition of those, that really hated my proceedings, more in regard of their own ends, then that they could much finde fault with those actions, and less suspect my integrity; so of the other side, you being both wise and noble, (having had a sufficient testimony of your fidelity to the Kings safety, when you carried him naked out of his Cradle, to secure him from the wilde rage of the inhabitants in Damascus ) I could not think any was so fit to be employed as your self in that affair, wherein consists, as I may, as well the good of the Nation, as the glory of Orontes family; since by this happy conjunction now ready to be celebrated by your presence, not onely peace will be distributed every where to the longing people, but the Gods Worship shall be advanced, in all the Temples belonging to the Delphine Jurisction; that before this agreement for so many years, have been disturbed by the violence of the Heresian opinion; not so much occasioned I may say by the wars, that have been continued between Egypt and Syria , as by reason of those conceived Antipathies in nature of the two Countreys, which neither leagues nor marriages could piece in any kinde formerly: 'Tis true, as envy must ever be the companion of command, and little less of any vertue, that carries but the shew of greatness, though incumbred with never so much toil and pains, so have the Queen and my self been still slandered with malicious tongues, as if we being strangers by birth, had no other intentions, but to sacrifice the glory of our Kingdom, to the onely ends of our appetites if not ambition; as well to the ruine of the Nobility in the particular, as the beggary of the Commonalty in the general; when the Heavens can bear witness of the integrity of our thoughts, and the earth shortly I hope will enjoy the effects of what our intentions alwayes endeavoured to bring forth. This being said, I shall let you know, what other designs rest in obscurity, however agreed on between the Egyptian Favourite and my self, in our private conference, since your part must be at Thebes , to urge the performance of these Transactions, on the behalf of that State and Government, as giving honourable assurance, nothing shall be omitted by King Orontes , conformable to such accord made upon the Treaty. I cannot deny, said he, but hitherunto we have nourished a war with the Egyptian Nation, as well to pull from those people some of their ambition, as to keep the better our own Subjects in quiet; since as the first without such a bridle put into their mouthes, would never have given over the appetites of conquering; so the others if they should not have been employed in Martial desires, would have formed continual Rebellions; either out of the levity of their natures, or the vain glory of their dispositions; being never to be made constant, but in the variety of objects, presented alwayes to their imaginations; witness Condorosus spirit, who at first set spaces to the difference by his own personal command, and now makes the motives of his disobedience, to be for no other respect, but to procure a loving peace between the two Kingdoms; wherefore if these remedies had not been used, either Syria must have sustained the hazzard of forreign invasions, or been eaten up by the misfortunes of civil factions; both being now prevented with our industry; of one side, by making timely preparation to resist or attempt any enemy, as of the other, in giving employment to those high courages, which could not have contented themselves, but in action of war by a continued service of contention: Besides it may be supposed, all will be the willinger to entertain, not onely the motions but the effects of peace, having with so much difficulty experimented the contrary; and think consequently, both Court and home felicities to be of such a value, that rather then venture their loss again by suggesting of new differences, they may rest satisfied with any moderate subjection, when their persons shall be esteemed, and their honors out of danger to be lost; loving their King, because he preserveth every mans right, and defending his Majesty, for that their own good depends upon his dignity; whereas nothing but blood, slaughters, and devastations followed the disobedience, which heretofore their unadvised ambitions had procured, as well in Syria as in other places: The same fate of happiness this may bring also to the Egyptian Nation, if they will not be their own enemies; since as their wealth is exhausted by their private and violent ambition, so in having onely by the accord, the Prince of Carthage , and the Senate of Lydia to contend against they are at liberty, who by Land and Sea intended the ruine of Osiris family; some of them being of a Religion so contrary to his principles, that the glorious Temple of Delphos , could scarce have stood firm from their malice and covetousness, if this peace had not been procured from the Syrian people. Besides Gratanus , said he, my designs have ever been, to unite small Princes in their ancient rights, witness my proceedings in Cassianus behalf, who by the miscarriage of his unfortunate Father, had lost both his honours and his interest in the Armenian Empire, though I could not compass such purposes, without bringing into those Countreys forreign Forces, whereby to establish a better security to the professours of the Delphine Worship, against the practice of the Heresian opinion; forcing an agreement with the Egyptian Territories, which be now obtained, it will be in our powers to prescribe laws to the world, either concerning government of Countrey, or sacrifices to the Gods; for notwithstanding it be alledged, as an infamous crime against my integrity, that I not onely made a combination with Hercrombrotus the Lydian General, to destroy the Egyptian prosperity, but also that very Worship which he so zealously professed, by giving Towns and Countreys into the possession and dominion of that Nation; yet in this manner I must discover the secret of my intentions to your understanding: In the first allegation, I had no other way to procure a peace from Osiris obstinacy, that else had continued our differences without end, since the Egyptians themselves laboured the same agreement with the Lydians interest, by no small industry before our endeavours; which obtained, would absolutely have destroyed our capacity, to have compassed this blessed and happy unity of both Countreys, that joyns now seemingly as well our mindes as our power, to work what effect we please, towards the accomplishment of those heroick designs, of propagating the Gods Worship every where, as well as to distribute justice in Asia and Affrica to other Princes. And for the second give me leave to say, that however I was constrained in our necessities to buy the Lydian assistance, with the delivery of Deorcas into their power; yet still were there such conditions reserved to the inhabitants, as give them an absolute protection against all oppressions, either Religious or Civil; knowing besides very well, that the Syrian State, being once at friendship with the Egyptian Kingdom, it would be an easie matter upon every occasion to wrest those Territories out of their possession, without danger to any, or much expence to our selves; whilst in the interim the Lydian Senate, are more then weary of the trouble that belongs to that Government; which they suppose they cannot long keep, either in regard of our Forces, or their own factions. But my Lord, said Gratanus , if your favours may not be interpreted as ill bestowed upon my particular, when I shall move the objections of any, (since implicitely I should be governed by the excellency of your wisdom, in regard that although others might erre, yet you cannot mistake) what testimonies are there to convert the multitude, concerning Prince Arethusius affairs? seeing he appears banished, and his Mother unrelieved, notwithstanding both their blood and interest, so nearly belongs to the Syrian Nation; especially when your chief designs be, as you say, to settle the rights of the inferiour Dominions, being I must confess the greatest glory to Orontes Crown; besides the obligations due to the heavens in that behalf; for where there is any omission of justice, by the general rules of all Religion, no perfect Worship of the Gods can be expected; considering also the dishonour to Kingly Dignity, that a Prince of the same degree, as well in right as in dignity, should be outed by the insolent rebellions of his own Subjects, from his ancient and successive Territories, without so much as one Monarch to take his part, notwithstanding the ties of nature in that particular, with the danger of the like example unto themselves to future posterity; but much more ominous it will appear, when those friendships shall be considered, which have been contracted with his greatest enemies, who brought his Father in scorn upon a Scaffold to suffer death, although former conditions had been made with the Syrian State, concerning Hyacinthia's Dower, if not her Childrens Inheritance; all, as I may say, honoured with the blood of most of the Potentates in Asia , not wanting also a near kindred with the most beauteous Lady of the Egyptian stock, ordained now by the providence of the immortal Gods, not onely to be our present Queen and Mistriss, but sent by the Heavens, as a glorious and happy pawn, to keep the world perpetually in such a peace, that never eye after ought to shed a tear, which I hope will continue, until eternity dissipate all things, by a more sublime period. Mazarius after he had studied a while upon this reply, looking the Duke in the face, with a certain familiar smile, as if something remained yet in his own bosom (not determined before) at last told him, that seeing it was his will to be his punctual confessor, rather as he supposed out of curiosity then need, when marriage affairs were not so proper, to be mingled with thoughts of revenge, would let him know more. Gratanus my friend, said he, secrets of State to the common people, resemble speculative Divinity, onely known to the learned studiant, and not to be debated without an interpreter, lest outward sense, turn all rather to Atheisme then sollid Doctrine; because what they understand not fully they think impossible to be, for that they cannot conceive the manner how; and so by consequence, either think it fiction or imposture; as it fared in the first ages with matters of Astronomy, that taught the regulation of the heavens by diligent observation; which coming to pass accordingly, those Authours were esteemed Gods; when as if anything thereof had failed, the very same men would have been thought deceivers, imputing the certainty onely to success, though contingent causes oftentimes alter, both the object and the effect, notwithstanding the rule be never so well grounded; which perhaps may be the fate also of my transactions: But the better to clear my intentions to your understanding, who can judge and will not be partial, since all must have that priviledge by reason of ignorance or malice, know from me these particulars, as well by occasion of your present imployment, fit in some sort to be communicated to the Egyptian Councel, as by those intimacies between us two, that may pretend to what trust soever can be conveyed to humane breasts. You are not ignorant, said he, how that the Daughter which the Kings Uncle had by his latter Wife, after the death of Alciana , being the sole heir of a mighty Estate, is a Lady, whose birth, beauty, and breeding, may challenge the best match, that the world can afford, either for title or command; which being joyned with the imperiousness of her spirit, hath oftentimes put the whole Court into dilemma's, as well how to marry her, as with what to satisfie her; since as of one side, we fear the factions her discontents may raise; so of the other side we know, no other proposal can be made to her high aspiring thoughts, then some Sovereign Prince of an eminent condition, which being scarce to be found, agreeing with her in years and temper, and with us in interest and commodity, we cast about in our resolutions, to fix her upon Arethusius the young Lydian King, whose Dignity may honour her, as her Estate benefit him; besides other concurrences of blood and affection, to render them both happy and contented, being a better pretence for our Nation, to make War with that powerful and injurious Commonwealth: 'Tis true, some propositions have been already made to this purpose; however rather by oblique intimations, then direct overtures: but whether the young mans thoughts, be not yet prepared for Nuptial obligations in nature, his minde being wholly imployed with revengeful desires; or that indiscreet Favourites about his person, will not suffer him to make any choice at all, for fear of destroying their own power, he seems to give little countenance to our inclinations, although his mother hath more plainly proposed it to his consideration, as a matter she wisheth, as well for his good, as her own satisfaction; knowing the consequence of such a conjunction to be, to both their commodities; which notwithstanding by the perswasions of others, hath wrought contrary effects, either in his disposition, or his pretentions; insomuch as it hath made some separation, between his duty and her person; he living in Pamphylia , as she remains in Syria , perhaps imagining to gain the possession of his own Countrey, onely by the assistance of the Egyptian power, joyned with the hearts and endeavours of his own people; although they have often deceived his expectation, being as it were totally cowed, by the prevailing fortune of the other party: This frowardness to our concernments, Gratanus , I cannot deny, but hath given some stop if not to our intentions, yet to the eagerness of our prosecutions on his behalf; for when he shall want a compliance in this particular, being surrounded with so many necessities, having scarce any subsistance but what comes from the Queens allowance, what would his proceedings be, when once settled anew in his Fathers Dominions, without our assistance? but either an open War arising from the motion of his conceived injuries, or at the best a disaffectionate peace, ready upon all surmized occasions, to break forth into a violent fury inflamed thereunto by the first instigations of any of his peevish Councellors, either not bribed by your money, or flattered by our State: Wherefore dear friend I say, it is no more then needful, to have some extraordinary tye, upon the actions and endeavours of that young Prince (either by Syria's Nuptials, or assured friendships) before Orontes honour be engaged, in a desperate, if not unprofitable contention; especially with a Nation, that now brings us commodity by commerce and riches in trading, thereby to purchase to our selves nothing but trouble in the enterprize, and from him distasteful ingratitude at the end; either by reason of his own inconstancy, or his Minions spleen, when he hath gained by our power that jurisdiction, which scarce will be acknowledged by any of his followers, until it be further demonstrated to their understandings, that notwithstanding all the Lydian promises and attempts, those Crowns will not be gained into his possessions, without the aid and assistance of forreign Forces; for his own people will not hold their condition certain, upon what terms they shall be Subjects if he prevail, or willing to venture for his right by reason of their own sensualities; witness the late rising in his behalf, when they had so fair an occasion to shew their courages, and yet so apparantly they failed in their endeavours, that they neither assembled as they should, or fought as they might. The next exceptions we have to Arethusius -proceedings is, his extream seeming averseness to the Delphine Religion, either engrafted in his nature by his former education, or being perswaded by those about his person; that as the change of the Lydian Rites in his practice, would not onely be a dishonour to his Fathers memory, but also lose many of his party at Sardis , who are most earnest in that profession; so that if he should still continue these resolutions, being put into his Kingdom by our assistance; instead of advancing the Gods service by our endeavours, (which is concluded in the Treaty between Egypt and Syria ) we should be the occasion, to bring again into Lydia that formal face of Worship, now altogether confused, if not totally destroyed by the late differences, that would of necessity establish their errours, and so by consequence give them continuance, whereas now they have almost no being at all; from whence also must arise something, whereby to nourish the Heresian opinions in our Dominions, either to less fidelity or more vigour; the one dangerous to our Government, as the other displeasing to Delphos Jurisdiction; and both contrary, if not destructive, to the Gods Worship, which have been the principal considerations belonging to the Peace and Marriage: To this purpose you know Gratanus , said he, our chief designs are, to reduce all the Princes of Asia to a certain kinde of conformity with us, either in Religion or manners, whereby as our interest may not be prejudiced, so conversation might be improved, by one onely method of civility and goodness, unto which also the Egyptian King seemeth to condescend; and shall we permit in the interim, young Arethusius being of this blood, and sustained by our bounty, to follow extravagantly, rather the fancies of others, then our sollid Councels? However perhaps flattering opinions heretofore, made him presume either upon his own interest in Lydia it self, or assisted by the Pamphylian power, to follow his former principles now destroyed; the one by this Treaty, the other in finding his own Subjects have no hearts; so that he must resolve at last, either to marry when we shall propose, or change that form of Worship in the Lydian Temples; at leastwise by permission to those in that Nation, who be of the Delphine belief, or be held a while from the possession of that Kingdom, which belongs to his right, though not yet to his fortune; wherefore unless he be pleased, either to alter his councel, or change his temper, neither Egypt nor Syria will be willing to contribute treasure, or employ men again with a more lasting magnificency, onely to settle and establish the Heresian Worship; which in a few years hath produced such sad effects, as to deprive his Father of his life, and himself of his Inheritance; whilst still he is perswaded to court those opinions, as if some heavenly influencies would depend upon their actions; however the worst of misfortunes, have been hither unto their fates, in every place, or in all Countreys, where they pretended to have their best Interest. But my Lord, said he to let you yet see a little further into my actions, though most of them have been hither unto obscured from the vulgar knowledge, (Transactions of State Policy until the issue resemble Prophetical predictions, enlightened alwayes at the end, and never before known) may afford matter for discourse, though conjectural and uncertain. 'Tis true, we have here an Ambassadour from the Commonwealth of Lydia , and another of ours remains in the City of Sardis : For the first I must tell you, I play with his employment, according to my own affairs, either to act or know, by which square I not onely deal with that confused Government, but put forward my interest by the complyance of other Princes, who fear their Sea power, and hate all such intentions; since Navigation cannot be free to their own lesser Traffick, if they be angred, like a nest of wasps, not caring who they wound by venting their spleen, though leaving their stings behinde them, they become themselves at last destroyed, making enemies, and losing friends in abundance, by which means I am become master of my own conditions with the Egyptian Family; for having contrived that difference by a seeming unity with them, Osiris Councellors could not be revenged of either, without a conclusion of this general peace; since against both they could not possibly contend; and more honourable of the two 'twas to piece with our State, (whose Government is the same, and the friendship more secure) then with a Jurisdiction, that hath in it neither faith in promises, nor certainty of continuance: but concerning our Minister of State with the Senate of Lydia , his designed instructions are, to hold up onely a flattering correspondency with that people, as well for the profit of Commerce between both Nations, as to keep their patience better in order; besides he gives us a continual information of all they do, whereby upon occasion hereafter, not onely their power is known, but their capacities are understood; whereby the League may be broke, if Arethusius prove conformable to our purposes, (which we can conveniently admit) by reason of those conditions made at Queen Hyacinthia's Marriage, or keep still the present Treaty on foot, as long as it appears beneficial to the Syrian Nation: In the interim we become more instructed in their mysteries of State Government, with the dispositions of their Inhabitants; as also take cognizance of their defects, for want of experience how to rule; being men not versed in deep points of policy, though their consciences are sufficiently fitted, for any impression gain or ambition can suggest, thus having both wayes an end, tending to the Gods Worship, as Syria's felicity: For the Lydian Ambassadour that lives either in the Kings Court, or in our company, be assured, his Interest goes no further then I prescribe, or his reputation more then we allow; governed perhaps also with a greater moderation then is expected, since as already he hath received some affronts by the Egyptian Favourite, so hath he had not yet any countenance from Orontes reception; my self making use of his employment, whereby to win him to our party, and by such a consequence perhaps the brave Haven of Deorcas may be restored, or still kept for a seeming correspondency, until we are better provided to an open defiance in the demands we intend to make concerning Hyacinthia's Joynture, though we are at present something interrupted, by those extraordinary preparations are in making for the Kings Marriage: besides in the interim I have gained thus much from his intelligence, concerning the affairs and changes of his own Countrey; The Senate and Army seem now to be at some difference one with the other, each striving who shall govern Lydia's Liberties; and this no way to be united in all probability, but either by Arethusius attempts, or our conjunction; wherefore it must be our master-piece, to blinde their eyes with a seeming intention of friendship, until their own impatiency makes them give the first occasion to such a breach, as cannot again be reconciled, whilst we suffer the Ministers of Egypt to play with the advantage by demanding restitutions in all those dammages they have received by any Lydian violence, during the difference between us and their Dominions, wherein they have been either actors or sufferers; which I may say puts on such a face of justice, that the world must approve of, as we cannot but permit; in the interim we intend to send for Prince Arethusius out of the Pamphilian Territories, to be a joyful assistant in those glorious Nuptials, shortly to be Celebrated with so much magnificency. These I may say, Gratanus , are the chief designs between the two Crowns, wherein both you and my self (by the goodness of the heavens) have been principal instruments; though a late accident in part might have destroyed my determinations; which also I shall not conceal from your knowledge, since the effects of friendship ought not to be darkened, much less obscured by the shadow of any disaster, knowing Gratanus is so noble, that he will conceal what Mazarius would not have divulged. You know, said he, there lived in the Court of Syria a young Gentleman called Manchinus , who if he had not been my Nephew, perhaps might have been commended by me, both in person and education, since most people did believe the same; but whether out of flattery to my authority, or for considerations of his true desert, I leave you to judge; onely I was carried on in nature with that partiality, that I intended to make him my heir, being by the vow I have made uncapable of other Children: But the young man whether inflamed by the opinion of my power, or intemperately perswaded in his private hopes, when the Princess Cloria came to Damascus , fell in love extreamly, either with her goodness, or her beauty; since greatness seldom moves in Cupids Theatre: These fires I may say in him were so little to be moderated, that I was induced to make the motion to some of Hyacinthia's friends, sending Manchinus in the interim to the wars of Pamphylia , knowing that action disperseth oftentimes settled imaginations; however, without much falshood, I must not deny my own ambition in this particular; since by such a wife to my Nephew, I was sure to procure wealth and honour to my house; wealth in regard of those possessions, that belong anciently to the Narcissian Family; and honour, for that the highest blood of Asia , is mixed abundantly in her veins; though the rare beauty of her person, with the excellency of her other perfections, I suppose most transported the young mans desire, as rendred his end fatal, however more memorable; so that contriving underhand a plot with the Lydian Ambassadour, who then remained in the City of Deorcas , the Princess Cloria was suddenly surprised; in which enterprize Manchinus also disguised was an actor. But before the Troops had conveighed the Princess half way towards her journeys end, Ascanius with some Companies borrowed front under his Brothers Jurisdiction, (whether by accident or advertisement) met suddenly with those injurious Forces, and after a long conflict (putting most of them to the sword) they rescued the Lady from that unjust imprisonment, in which misfortune my Nephew fell with the rest, as a just judgement given against his proceedings. Here Mazarius ended his discourse, with some apparent tears in his eyes; which shewed that Statesmen can be compassionate sometimes, though ambition for the most part is their predominant humour. The Duke having heard out this relation, after a while to give circumstance rather then consideration to his answer, since he was held excellent both in language and replyes, made him this return. My Lord, said he, as the issue in all things crowns the intention, (at leastwise to the belief of people, who judge but by the effects in most actions) so cannot it now be otherwise thought by the world, but that you have transcended in your designs, as if your proceedings had been carried on by some heavenly influence, in regard such a period is produced thereby, as not onely joyns Kingdoms, but unites affections in so propitious a manner, that the earth begins already to fructifie with a new prosperity, whilst the inhabitants every where may enjoy the benefice; amongst whom I finde my person most obliged, being chosen as Minister to perform that office, the greatest Prince of the Universe might have gloried to have undertaken with no small transportation. These complements quickly parted the two friends, the one to the accomplishment of his State Affairs, and the other to a preparation for his journey: but scarce had many hours passed in these considerations, before a messenger arrived suddenly from Court, commanding the Birth-day of the new Queen to be observed, which all in general (conceiving it to be a pleasing earnest of their future hopes) in this manner executed. The Town was adorned all over with intermixt Roses and Lillies, made into Garlands and other pretty composures, which hung upon Pyramides and Collumes, covered with imperial Crowns: The chief Temple was furnished with white and yellow Damask, whilst the Pillars were embraced with interwoven Ivy, neatly plated into figures together, bearing the name of the two young (though Majestick) Lovers, as emblems demonstrating their future affection, whereby the earth might become fruitful to people, as prosperous to themselves; the one in peace as the other in glory: Upon the High Altar was placed the Goddess Vesta, with Hymen standing by her side, to whom was afforded a bountiful Sacrifice by Mazarius , until he was advertized, that the same ceremony was performed, by the Egyptian Favourites on the other side of the water; after which, by reason of the heat of the season, they both met under Canvas Coverings in a solemn procession, proclaiming their joy and gladness for the perpetual amity, that had been so happily begun between the two discontented Nations. When these ceremonies were finished, the whole day following was spent, in nothing but feasting and congratulations; all the Conduits in the interim running with the purest Wine, to glad the hearts of the tumultuous Commonalty, who by sense onely apprehended the consequence of that great and beneficial Jubile. As these high expressions, demonstrated auspicious Omens to the great Countreys of Syria and Egypt , so the Duke of Tyre with some of his gallant Train, quickly parted from that Theatre of Bliss, that seemed to give both wings and fire to his imployment; directing his hasty march towards the City of Thebes , the place where Osiris then kept his Royal Court, which in a very few dayes travel brought him to the rest of his company; and so consequently within a very few dayes more arrived at the place; whereupon notice being given, the King commanded presently the masters of the Ceremonies, not onely to provide for his reception in a most magnificent manner, but to give him meeting with the choicest horses Affrica could afford; on which were mounted the best of his Nobility, who in the middle of the day brought him into the City, through such a concourse of people, that appeared to have emptied the earth of inhabitants, whereby to be spectators of that glorious entertainment; which at the last descended Gratanus at the Palace Gate, for that his Masters passion to be possessed of his fair Mistriss, would give him no respite for consideration, what he was to say, or how to be provided, against the curious observations of that politick Nation, that for many years formerly had been in a desperate contention with the Syrian splendour; however ambition for the most part procures envy, as dominion doth jealousie. But scarce had the great Ambassadour time given him, to bestow fitting complements upon his noble conductors, before they all received summons to appear in the presence of that Majesty, which onely equalled his own Prince in power, who staid for his coming in a Hall (resembling Heaven for light, and a Paradice for beauty, placed upon a Throne, elevated six steps above the floor, and guarded on either side with carved Lions: At the first entry Gratanus made a little stand, either to behold or admire that mighty personage, whose contention with his great Master, had almost driven the whole world into despair; no way to be repaired but by this desired union with that State, that religously had put on a constant purpose, rather to submit then dispute, when love was the subject, and a Lady the object of his imployment, not to be conquered but by soft and gentle motions; so that waving other circumstances then a most low obeysance, according to the custome of his Countrey, with a kinde of a brave comportment, uttered this language. To call you onely a Prince, were to derogate too much from your greatness; and to stile you more then a man, were to intrench upon the purity of our Religion; wherefore most mighty Monarch of the Suns influence, that hath no course but about your Territories, measuring equally, not onely nights and dayes, but sea and land, that yields fruits to your people, as well as treasure to your self, whilst your power commands every habitation between the two Tropicks: In this posture and no other, I am injoyned by my own resplendent Lord, governing in like manner under the temperate Zones, whose wisdom exceeds his years, as his victories make him famous; not oney to offer you peace in friendship, but beg your Daughter in marriage; a Lady as he verily believes, the Goddess Nature hath wrought her utmost skill; since in her making the highest heavens powred down such a blessing, that her soul was already prepared for Olympus mansion, before the destinies had considered how long she should live; her mixture being so admirable, that a question will be in after ages, whether her Birth did more illustrate her Dignity, or her sanctity her Religion; for as the one may be said to have no beginning, in the antiquity of her family; so the other can reach to no end by reason of eternity; both being shut up in such a youthful perfection, that the very Deities themselves can scarce put on equal forms, whereby to become more ravishing objects: If you accept the one, and grant the other, my message is performed; but if you refuse either, I may believe the world will fall with the disaster; since as these hopes seemingly unite again the distractions of this huge Universe, so the contrary effects must needs once more turn it into another Chaos; in regard young Orontes , whose spirits now onely breathe by these assurances, must of necessity contract such desperations, that will afresh inflame Asia with new prodigies. To set forth the commodities to each Empire by this consummation, were to teach knowledge to the gravest Councels; since both Favourites have thought it necessary to be effected, confirmed also by the approbation of most Oracles, who foretold the happiness would follow by such a conjunction, when every Government should be divided between two Princes, not to be concluded, whether their fortune or their piety had been more efficatious, towards the glory of their prosperity, though appearing something shaded in the vigour of their own contentions, driven on by such a fate, as if the Gods had dreaded a War against themselves by any agreement; so that these jealousies of the heavens being now laid asleep by a stronger influence, there rests no more then your approbation, to render both feared, and men happy; since Syria's King hath no other ambition, but to become your Son-in-law, however slave to his own Mistriss; offering for a Dower, what his youth can compass, or his dominion may command; besides the affections of his dear Mother, derived as another excellent plant from that majestick soil, where nothing grows, but miracles of nature, or inspirations of sanctity: wherefore let the obstacles be ever curst, that shall hinder this Jubile, when Monarchs shall agree, not onely to give life to the almost destroyed earth, but consent to have another Cynthia , transported from the Affrican Clymate, whereby to heat Asia with new fires, that by consequence will ingender such productions, as mortals shall be changed into Deities, and habitations into Elizians, to continue by their power, until eternity gives the last period to time it self; when contributing sacrifices cannot be wanting in Delphos to that purpose, since the Holy Arch-Flamin never ceaseth, to offer Hecatombs of richest price, expecting every hour to hear the news confirmed by a joyful Embassie. Although Osiris could not be but something transported with his own praises, proceeding from a tongue, not onely carrying upon it both Eloquence and Honour, but deputed for that effect, by the Rival under the heavens, that could give any stop, either to his greatness or command, within the large Territories of the Suns Dominions; yet putting on his accustomed Egyptian gravity, being in the presence of his own Subjects, that diligently observed every particular comportment of their Prince, onely gave him thanks formally; promising to offer the matter to his Daughter, knowing her modesty and retirements, were not to be invaded by any violence, though he could not deny, but the propositions brought with them, as well safety to the world, as benefit to her self; withal desiring him in the interim, to rest satisfied in such entertainments, as his City of Thebes was able to afford, according to his directions or his peoples ability: These expressions carried away Gratanus to another appartament of the Palace, where he was given to understand the Queen remained, to allow him a favourable and noble reception, comming into that Kingdom, with Olive branches of Peace, and flourishing Laurels of Marriage, that prenosticated such prosperity to the inferiour Regions, almost overcome with despairing ruines, for want of those blessed overtures, that seemed now to clear the darkned sky from all malignant vapours, that had for so many years opprest (or rather suffocated) totally its happiness. Gratanus found the Queen seated under a most rich Cloth of State, embroidered all over with Oriental Pearle, onely in the midst was neatly wrought a black-spread Eagle, the proper Arms of her Extraction; this also was so interwoven with Bugle and Rubies; that it was a question, whether the magnificency or the skill surpassed; she wore a Royal Crown shining with unvaluable Diamonds, which either graced or complyed extreamly with her youth and beauty: There seemed to be no Attendants, much less Companions in her Throne of retirement; onely two small Infants sent a late, as happy Omens to the Egyptian Empire, the King her Husband not having any Sons before, rested under her proper Canopy: 'Tis true, at some distance behinde her Chair, were placed a couple of ancient Matrons, apparalled like Sybels , and were covered on their heads with white Mytres, bespotted all over by several Characters, teaching thereby (silently) the secrets of their Countreys Religion, from whence a long Linnen Vail reached to the ground, which closed and opened before, as either inspirations or appetites gave them the occasion: But the Queen, whether transported by the apprehension of so pleasing a Messenger, or something willing to comply with the fashions of her own Nation of Armenia , not onely in a pleasant demeanour entertained the gallant Ambassadour, but freely communed with him, concerning the Rareties of the Syrian Kingdom, which gave them both employments sufficient, until decorums of State called him away to his own retirement, in a most magnificent Palace provided for his reception; whither presently came all the great Officers of the Court; some with Complements, others with Affection, and every one with Ceremony, to welcome him into Egypt , till at last the day being far spent, they left him to his more quiet repose. However Gratanus was denied (by the rigid rules of that Nation) any audience of the Princess Hesperiana , before the Nuptial Rites should be performed in Hymens Temple, yet in regard of the desired complyance of Osiris Family, he was conducted the next day into a small though glorious Chappel of the Kings house, where he found the Lady placed in a Gallery, separated from the outward room by something obscure windows, which let his looks know thus much of her person, that upon her head was placed a Coronet of Gold, from whence proceeded many shining rayes of the same mettal, wrought with Diamonds and other precious stones, whilst her habit was all white; onely a sky-coloured Mantle lined with powdered Ermines, and spotted on the outside with interwoven Suns, covered her seeming comely shoulders: 'Tis true, during the continuance of the solemn Sacrifice, she was not perceived to move at all in any kinde, unless it were sometimes in a most grave and modest posture, to cast up her bright eyes towards the Heavens, as if she consulted alone with the Gods during her own private Devotions; nevertheless those being absolutely finished, she rose from her seat to retire with a certain gracious smile, (either natural to her countenance, or commanded by her will) accompanied by a comely bend of her body, whereby the better to salute the Ambassadour: In the afternoon the Duke was invited, to be spectator of those Countrey exercises, in which most appeared as the people thought, the generous courages of their youth and Nobility: The place appointed for the encounter, was in the great Market place of the City, as it were besieged round about with Belconies, in the manner of an ample Theatre; being so furnished with Ladies and other Gallants of the Court, that it might very well become a question in reason, whether prospect of the two would have the more attractive influence, upon the desires and apprehensions of the Syrian strangers; since as the combat of the Bull (being so called) must of necessity prove rarest to their expectations, yet certainly that variety of beauties would be most agreeable to their senses. When they were all placed in their seats, four youths appeared in the list prepared for the Combat, most neatly cloathed in light Taffety, carrying small and long Spears in their hands; so that presently being let loose the enraged Beast, they as soon addressed themselves to the charge; whilst two of the company pricked him behinde to render him more furious, which not onely made him roar, and foam at the mouth enragedly, but gave him such appetites of revenge, that with a most violent motion he prosecuted the rest, who with courage and nimble dexterity, both avoided the danger, and wounded him with their weapons, insomuch as he was glad to return upon his first assaulters, provoked by his malice, or deceived in the exchange, seeing of them he found no better entertainment; for as he came running towards one, he taking advantage of his horns, (being near the ground) leapt over his neck, and in the interim stroke him with his Javelin upon the Throat, with so great a fortune, that streams of black blood quickly followed the wound, as fore- tokens of an expected victory; which kept not the company in any long suspence, since the Bull presently declining, both in his courage and his strength, at last before all the assembly (yielding to his fate) determined his life, as a just Sacrifice offered to the young mans honour, having contributed so largely to it; who with a certain modest countenance, adorned by graceful behaviours, received in the presence of the people, the Garland ordained for the Conquest, and in that manner so Crowned, was conducted through the City, until dark night forbad their further Triumphs. These delightful entertainments might have employed the thoughts of Gratanus for a longer time, if his Commission had not limited his return; the youthful passions of Orontes admitting no delay, when Love was the Commander, and a beauteous Lady the Object, accompanied also with such vertues, that provoked a speedy satisfaction: However notwithstanding these considerations, the Duke was invited again to a new curiosity; and the rather to be dispenced withall, because as yet Osiris was not ready for an answer: The rarety to be seen, was a Palace of the Kings some distance from the great Town of Thebes , almost equalling it in bigness, and much surpassing it in richness; being built upon the ruines of the ancient Labyrinth, that formerly contained under- ground sixteen stately Courts, wrought with such exquisite skill, that the doors opening and shutting with iron, made a noise like Thunder upon their several motions: As the windings of that intricate maze, of old was the worlds wonder, so this modern building at present, became Egypts fame; especially when the keyes belonging to every Chamber, out-weighed above one thousand pounds: To describe all the particulars of this stately Fabrick, were to enter into discourses of extraordinary protractions, since as the whole was composed of multitudes distinguished; so every division appeared a kinde of miracle, either of art or nature; onely let it suffice, there was one stone preserved under the high Altar, that seemed of more value, then all the rest of that vaste expence; though the extraordinary pious intention of him who raised this stupendious work, ought to be held of greater price, being performed by the Grandfather of the now King upon this occasion: He was on a time in the wars, and not able to become conquerour of a strong place, that seemed most to oppose his victories, (whereby his honour as well as his designs appeared to suffer) unless he would resolve with his battering engines, to beat down a holy Temple belonging to the Gods service; nevertheless in the expiation of that apprehended fault, he made a present vow to the Heavens, to build such an edifice in his own Countrey, as should equal, if not exceed all the known structures of the world, wherein also might be continually observed the Delphine Rites, by the best sort of Religious persons, could be assembled for that purpose, from all parts of the Egyptian Dominions. After the seeing of all things necessary either within or about this magnificent Palace, the Duke accompanied by the Officers of the Court, (who were not sparing by the Kings commands, carefully to observe all his contents) returned again to his first station. But in the interim, whilst the Ambassadour was imployed in these and other divertisements, Osiris according to his promise made, was not backward to acquaint his Daughter Hesperiana with the King of Syria's desires; wherefore visiting her in her Chamber one day, after some circumstances, he spoke to her in this manner. Hesperiana , said he, after the death of your vertuous Mother, Sister to Orsames , who left behinde her onely your Brother and your self, a youth the heavens also in a short time took to their care, by which means you became for some years the heir apparent of my Crowns: This I must tell you is the chief occasion, of the continuance of the Wars between us; in regard the Syrian ambition hath been ever to have you bestowed in marriage upon their young King, whereby to become interessed (as they believe) in the Egyptian Dominions, by a juster title then meerly conquest: But my Councel on the other side, to prevent the mischief of transporting the Government by such a conjunction, into the hands and power of another Nation, that probably would not keep their residency in this Countrey, never let me rest quiet without importunities, until I was perswaded to have another Wife from the Kingdom of Armenia ; in which first began, if not our greatness, at leastwise the prerogative of Blood, we claim before other people of the world; upon which I may say, hath fallen also the apparent blessing of the immortal Gods, in granting me by the Lady your Mother-in-law, two hopeful Sons, whereby the pretensions of succession, that hitherunto hath caused so much contention, will be quieted: Nevertheless the Mother of Orontes still continuing the same desires, of matching with our Family, notwithstanding the price of your Dower be abated, hath sent this magnificent Ambassadour, not onely to procure my consent, but obtain your love, whereby Asia may he at peace, as well as Syria satisfied: to these demands there remains nothing now but your approbation, since the great Ministers of both States deputed for that purpose, have joyntly concluded to this effect. The Princess Hesperiana being thus surprized by her Fathers discourse, it was a question whether the bashful modesty of her nature, or some hidden resolutions in devotion, most reflected upon her apprehensions, since for a pretty space she stood still without any answer at all; until at last as it were overcome by her obliged duty, when a few tears had something qualified the burning tincture of her present blushes, her ruby lips in this manner gently made a passage for these words. Sir, said she, I hope I shall not much transgress in duty, if freely I lay before your thoughts these considerations; and rather may I expect a gracious interpretation of what I shall utter, in regard I am resolved notwithstanding, to govern my actions by your will; although I desire my obedience may rather be regulated by a Parents Authority, then a Sovereigns Jurisdiction; since for the most part it relates more to indulgency then ends, when as the other oftentimes proceeds, either from councel or conveniency, onely belonging to State Affairs, without those absolute determinations of Religion, which the Gods have just cause to expect from Princes here on earth, however flourishing with never so great a prosperity: In this posture be pleased to remember, with what a magnanimous constancy, your great Grandfather ever opposed the dangerous beginnings of the Heresian opinions, in the large Kingdoms of Armenia and other places, though contradicted with so many difficulties, that had not his courage and wisdom conquered both their power and subtilties, those people of the Delphine Worship had been over-run, with nothing but destroying errours; who nevertheless after all his victories, buried the rest of his happy dayes in a simple Cloyster, to the observation onely of piety and contemplation; which descended his Dominions to another mighty example of zeal and devotion, that put to death his own Son, because he was esteemed tainted with some opinions, by means whereof your Father not onely came to the Crown, but proved another wonder of Religion, until your self succeeded him in the like vertues, towards the sacred Temple of Delphos ; from whence hath proceeded such blessings to your Subjects, after a long expectation, that the Gods have not onely bestowed upon you heirs to your Crown, but peace afforded from your opposers; in regard of all which, I am imboldned by your religious indulgency, to acquaint you with this bashful secret, wherein perhaps I have something offended your goodness, because I joyned not first your approbation with my resolution; since precipitation in childrens actions, are not altogether to be excused, though accompanied with never so strong religious intentions, because a certain natural obligation belongs alwayes, both to their profession and Parents interests: 'Tis true, as I ever desired my marriage, when I stood in most probability of being heir to the Egyptian Crown, should conduce to the propagation of the Gods Worship, according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the great Temple of Delphos , in regard of the multitudes of enemies that seemed daily to make war against its sacred customs; so when I saw the heavens after a long desire, had provided sufficiently for that succession, in the happy and fortunate birth of my two Brothers, having no more need of my assistance in that laudible and pious work; I made a vow to great Isis the Goddess of our Countrey, to serve her as a chaste Priestess during my life, which promise can onely be dissolved, by the Dispensation of the powerful Arch-Flamin of the Holy City, otherwise I must not become Wife to the mighty King of Syria , notwithstanding any agreement hath been made to that purpose. With these words she rested silent, distilling another gentle showre of tears from her lovely eyes. The King seeming now something amazed at these unexpected expressions of his Daughter, especially for that she had made a vow to the Goddess Isis without his privity, stood still for a long space, not making any answer at all, until at last as it were confirmed in her intentional duty to himself, and believing the motive proceeded from high inflamations of zeal, towards the Temple of Delphos (an opinion that ever honoured the Egyptian Family) after he had kissed her once or twice with a fatherly affection, delivered his thoughts in this manner. Most dear Hesperiana , said he, and the dearer for the intention of Religion, as I never doubted of thy piety since reason opperated first in thy fair soul, so I command thee to be assured, being thou hast submitted thy obedience to my pleasure as the worlds conveniency, that a messenger shall be dispatched presently to the great Arch-Flamin , whereby to procure the Dispensation needful for such a service, and no Article made between the Egyptian and Syrian Monarchs in the interim, which shall not tend absolutely to the Worship of the immortal Gods. With these words suddenly he left the room, with such a joyful aspect in his countenance, as shewed he was very well satisfied with all his Daughters resolutions. But however the King parted from his Daughter Hesperiana with pacification enough, in regard both of her religion and obedience; yet after a while being retired in his more private Cabinet, as well to consider as to resolve, in a matter, wherein appeared some difficulties, he began to be troubled with these doubtful apprehensions: First he thought that Gratanus the Syrian Ambassadour, might suspect some want of integrity in the Egyptian proceedings, after the final conclusion of the two Ministers of State, to be sent away onely with hopes of a Dispensation, without effecting absolutely what he came about, contrary to the violent appetites of young Orontes, (the nature of youth being apt to be enflamed, having but the Idea's of their wishes represented to their imaginations) the next thing that troubled him was, how he should salute the Court it self of Delphos , whereby easily to obtain the required request, concerning the separation of Hesperiana from her vow, belonging to the great and sacred Goddess Isis , being the chief Deity of the Egyptian Family; especially when as not onely Orontes might finde out other matches, within the vast circumference of the earth, without trespassing at all upon any manner of sacriledge; but himself having children sufficient by the Gods favour, to inherit his own vast Dominions, without seeking by a Fathers authority, to interrupt (if not destroy) the excellent piety of a Daughter, for no other end, but to compass a few commodities belonging to his temporary Kingdoms; besides he apprehended, that the peace made, might be but dissembled in the present, and prove altogether ominous in the conclusion, if his Sons should chance by accident to fail; by which means Hesperiana's posterity would transferre the Egyptian inheritance to a Syrian family, either to be governed, or contended against with as much hatred, as the late Wars produced between both Nations, almost to the destruction of the whole world, notwithstanding Andromida her self was a Childe of the same House, and yet appeared no mean actor in the contention, (Crowns and Diadems never worn safely, onely by tyes of affinity and alliance, when Swords and Titles have either opportunity or right) wherefore he could not but in some melancholly manner reflect upon these particulars, although his great Favourite at the borders had concluded this Article of Marriage, whereby, as he believed, the better to fortifie each Countrey. But however the King at the present, appeared something confused with these thwarting cogitations (his honour being engaged of the one side, as the hazzard of his Dominions on the other) yet he resolved so far to satisfie Gratanus the gallant Ambassadour, as to assure him, he would within a very few moneths in person, conduct his Daughter Hesperiana to the Confines of Syria , there to entertain the affections of young Orontes , in prosecution of that Treaty which had been so happily begun by the two Ministers of State: This determination in some sort quieted his thoughts; in the interim not doubting but the great Arch-Flamin of Delphos would either grant the dispensation, (being a lover of peace) or else afford reasons for the denial sufficient to content both Kingdoms, whereby a continuance in union might still remain between the Nations, notwithstanding any obstacle proceeding imaginarily from sacred respects. In this manner Osiris endeavoured, to please, if not confirm, the Duke of Tyre in his glorious employment, accompanied also with those splendid divertisements that most honoured his person; which necessarily protracted Gratanus return, since the Syrian civilities were esteemed punctual in all kinde of Ceremonies; whilst unlookt for, of a sudden, Creses appeared in the Court of Egypt , sent by his Master Prince Arethusius out of the Countrey of Pamphilia , not onely to thank the great Monarch, for those favours he had already received within his Territories, but desired his further assistance against his own unnatural Subjects, whom he found after the death of Hercrombrotus rather inclined to undergo their former slaveries, then entertain Treaties of peace for his Titles, notwithstanding their obstinacy threatned an absolute destruction to the Lydian Nation: Gratanus understanding of Creses arrival, and having been well acquainted with him in the Wars of Syria , one morning coming to his Chamber, he fell into communication with his privacy, concerning both his journey and his employment; which Creses effectually related in this manner, after some other discourses had past between them of divers natures, though chiefly belonging to the Lydian Affairs. You cannot but know, said he, that after the death of Hercrombrotus , that great Traytor, Tyrant, and Dissembler, notwithstanding he had placed his Son in the Throne of Lydia , in hopes enough he should reign, with the same constancy and oppression as himself; for that most people, either terrified with the Fathers actions, or overcome by their own sensualities, had put on resolutions in their minde to be quiet, rather then hazzard all for the right of any succession, was nevertheless soon displaced from that extorted honour, by the pride and ambition of his own Army; because he would not readily yield, to make his next Commander General of those Forces, that were not onely designed to guard his person from all violence, but to keep the Kingdom in a most exact obedience, which quickly set up consequently the old Senate, to be serviceable to the Souldiers profit; since some face of Government was to be used, though the essence had been lost long ago, in the slaughter of the King; however this change as it should seem pleased not long, insomuch as amongst many other confusions, the Camp again began to quarrel with that piece of a Senate; not because they were unlawful in their usurpation, but in regard they were not sufficiently obedient to Military Precepts, though totally exercised in Arbitrary Power; which after a while turned them out of their houses of State, to converse singly with other people of the meanest quality, though formerly they made use of their tumults to suppress others, whose Lands they had purchased by their unjust Decrees, the better to involve the whole Nation in a levelling quality, that no distinction might be perceived, either in person or in estate, that themselves onely might govern all with more ease: This as I said being done, the Officers of the Guard took upon them the absolute managing of every Affair both Military and Civil; which continued in this manner for a few weeks, until the Countrey of Myssia , of a sudden produced another Commander called Hermelaus , whose honesty we hope is more, and his experience cannot be less, then any other Captain belonging to that Train, that opposed the King either in his will or countenance: This person I must say being now upon the stage for action, began first to complain in writing, that the Senate was invaded by the Interest of a few Officers of the Army, whose ambitions made them insolent, as the Estates they had gotten fearful, lest the Government should be ruled by the Command of any other Supream Authority, then what the Souldiers might absolutely direct: Besides he pretends, that the diversity of opinions in matters appertaining to the Gods, hath almost taken away the face of all Morality, within the Dominions of the Lydian Commonwealth: After these intimations, he sent presently a Letter to the great City of Sardis , perswading them to joyn with him in those endeavours, that might again bring the stream a right way, by assembling a new the old Senate, to conserve their own priviledges, being in danger to be overthrown by these present Rulers, whose Murthers, Perjuries, and Rapines, had rendred them audacious in wickedness: Hermelaus , I say, in this posture of expectation, not onely addressed some Letters to the King, then remaining in the Countrey of Pamphilia , but not long after marched at the head of the whole Army, into the very heart of the Lydian Dominions, having left Myssia in the hands of those Governours, that he supposed would be most true to his intentions: But before he had sent some Troops to oppose Abactanus , he was advertised, that the Senate once more had reassumed their Authority, and were sitting then in the City of Sardis with some Majesty; however these often changes in Government so much terrified the apprehension of the wiser sort of people, knowing the right of the Crown onely belonged to Prince Arethusius , withall remembring what a flourishing prosperity they enjoyed, in the Reign of his Father, did nothing but salute Hermelaus through the Countreys, as he went, with diversity of Addresses, intimating they desired again a new King, and their old Laws; without which they were assured, that neither the Gods could be served, or their own Priviledges secured. In this posture I may say things at the present remain, none being able to judge what this hopeful General means, or how the fates have determined of Lydia's Liberties; since as the Souldiers are violent to oppose the Government by any single Authority, having gained mens Lands rather by oppression then right, (wherefore doubt much their own Titles, upon such an admittance) so of the other side, the whole Nation having experienced, that without a King it is impossible to subsist, not onely by reason of perpetual payments, but want of forreign Correspondency, are grown almost desperate in their resolutions. 'Tis true, if Arethusius my Master comes to his Crown by any composition, without doubt he will be curbed in his Authority; wherefore I am now come to this Court, with intention to solicite great Osiris for a competent assistance, since our banishment out of the Territories of Syria , gives us from thence neither conveniency nor possibility, though against all the rules both of friendship and hospitality; the more deplorably to be considered, when our actions formerly have been so serviceable, to the glory and security of Orontes Crown: With these words he rested silent, as if his grief did shut up the rest of his discourse. Gratanus being sufficiently instructed in the mysteries of his relation, by those Conferences he had had with Mazarius the wise Favourite, began of a sudden to smile in his face; as if either he apprehended not the consequence of what had been related, or intended by such testimonies of mirth, to perswade. Creses out of his own melancholly apprehensions; but finding his countenance was not to be instructed to a better appearance, without more realities understood, taking him by the hand, desired his better opinion of the Syrian Nations; especially since for his own particular, he had exprest alwayes love and diligence, in Prince Arethusius concernments, when either his Titles came in question, or his person was to be honoured: Nevertheless, as he said, that he might rest better satisfied both with Mazarius , and the Kings Councellours at Damascus , he would deliver the reasons of some jealousies, To this purpose, said he, you must be advertized, that there are but two principles, upon which foundation Statesmen chiefly relye, to make lasting contracts or friendships with other Governments; and that is the ties either of Religion or Alliance: For the first you know, that your Prince is so far from giving any countenance to the Delphine Worship, that besides his entertaining of the contrary profession in other Countreys, he cannot as yet be brought to promise, when he is settled in his Dominions, those Subjects of our Religion, shall be freed from their intollerable persecution, by way of Law, according to the justice of the Kingdom; imagining perhaps by such indulgent concessions, he might lose some of his party in Lydia ; which I must tell you plainly, disheartens all our Nation from his needful assistance; whereas those now at Sardis that keep him injuriously out of his right, do offer most willingly to condescend to any such Article, provided the Syrian Court will not meddle with his Titles: And concerning the second, whereas a match hath been proposed of Orestes Blood, and consequently belonging to Orontes care, which onely in probability might continue a certainty in his friendship, either his youth seems to be transported with other affections, or his nature cannot be brought to love our alliance, though the commodity be never so apparent to his hopes; wherefore it is to be doubted, when he should have obtained his ends by our assistance, he might prove the fatallest enemy to our concernments; as well in what belongs to the true Worship of the Gods, as in trading with other general correspondencies belonging to the profit of both Countreys; which you know, is wisely to be prevented if it be possible. When Gratanus had made an end of saying thus much, he rested from any more discourse, with an intention to invite Creses to some reply; which after a little space, brought forth this answer; however as if he seemed unwilling, to dispute any thing of his masters intentions; especially with one, whom he was confident, entertained a sufficent affection in his minde, not onely to Prince Arethusius , but to all his party in the general. My Lord, said he, as there may be some scruples, in the wise providence of Statesmen concerning these suspicions; especially when Kingdoms and Empires are hazzarded in the defection; so of the other side give me leave to tell you, that neither of these doubts ought to be laid to Arethusius charge, he being a Prince as full of honour in his thoughts as vallerous in his actions, though circumspect enough in his considerations, when the world appears so little assistant to his affairs; for example, what a strange accord was made with Hercrombrotus to his disadvantage? seeing neither the mixture of Blood, or the affront done to Majesty, could hinder that agreement, which onely procured a small conveniency to the Syrian Kingdom; however purchased by a horrid, if not ominous president, never to be forgotten: And to let you see how much my Master suffers by these misprisions, consider, that as the worlds Government, consists most in those of the Delphine Religion, so must I ask you what testimonies you have, of his averseness to people of your belief? when not onely many about his person, have both countenance and favour in his presence, but himself ever resided in such Countreys, that belong exactly to that profession, as having a strong confidence of their compliance, when either the Gods shall prove propitious to his purposes, or the Syrian Empire may be converted to his particular; however in the interim he must be forced to use some policy, not altogether to lose that party, he hath had in his own Kingdom, whereby with more facility, to be able to compass that right, the fates have hitherunto denied him with over-much cruelty and injustice; neither can it be thought, in a soul possest with so excellent a bravery, one corner thereof can harbour such an ingratitude, as to make him forget the faithful services, he received from the Delphine people in his greatest extremities; not any man of the number being ever known to betray his trust, or spare his life, when there was the least occasion, either to contend or dye for the Kings Royalty; which fidelity hath been since punished by his enemies, with all the marks could be devised, both of disgrace and devastation, to terrifie their thoughts to another temper, or revenge that Loyalty themselves cannot help: And for this refusing to marry a Syrian Wife, the heavens must be blamed and not himself, either for his courage or misfortunes, since his minde as yet must not stoop to those gentle dalliances, which necessarily belong to all Nuptial ties, before he hath endeavoured those conquests of his own, that will make him a King, according to the prerogative of his Birth, Blood, or Honour, to dispute his injuries, and by that means purchase fame instead of posterity; these being his heroical intentions in probability; and I wish the whole world were possest with the same opinion, whereby Arethusius concernments might never dye in the memories of men, either to be revenged or relieved, in that which onely belongs to the necessary example of other Princes, not more worthy, though far happier then himself. Gratanus by his countenance seemed something bitten at this reply, which made him continue silent for a pretty spare, until at last he broke out into these words. 'Tis true, said he, these are glorious and plausible pretences; however the great and wife Favourite Mazarius , cannot so easily digest the slaughter of his young Nephew Manchinus , onely for offering a noble love to the fair Widow your King Sister, which perhaps would have brought, not onely conveniency to her self, but assiance to her Brother; since Statesmen, do not use to bestow favours (being the chiefest productions of their interest, purchased by their pains and industry) without some testimonies, they shall be either requited or served, with constancy and affection upon all occasions. Creses could not chuse but smile to hear this related, seeing he had the power to contradict the information, which he did suddenly after this manner. My Lord, said he, if loves be to be prosecuted with rapes, I know not what morality is left in the world, much less any Religion at all to be found; however give me leave to satisfie you thus far in this particular, although I will not trouble you with the whole story, as to tell you the person you mention is not yet dead; for the Princess Cloria no less charitable then fair, when Manchinus had been extreamly wounded in that unlawful conflict, was presently recommended to her care for his recovery; in which she used such diligence (he in the interim desiring to be concealed from the knowledge of his friends) that within two moneths time he recovered his present health, and intends to present himself to his Uncle, upon the consummation of the marriage between your King and Osiris Daughter; with the true confession of his fault, procured by his unruly passions. O heavens, said Gratanus , what lucky Omens are these to precede that glorious meeting, shortly to be between the two Kings? whereby the whole earth is to be divided, either by their conquering Swords, or to their propitious Aspects; in which assembly, I swear by the immortal Gods, not onely to be serviceable to the fair and incomparable Princess, in what belongs to the right of her young Son, but also concerning those Crowns, that have been so injuriously withheld from the possession, of that gallant King of the Lydian and Myssian Territories. With these words presently he rose from his seat, taking, with a few complements, his farewel of Creses , leaving him in the interim not a little satisfied by his expressions. But Creses nevertheless, being extreamly solicitous in his minde, in those affairs that appertained to his Masters concernments, endeavoured to fortifie his right all he could; wherefore he used his best power, after Gratanus was parted from the City of Thebes , to have some private conference with the King; as well for that he knew there were many Courtiers, not so much affected to his party, as the better in particular to possess Osiris with the right understanding of the cause; and more especially in regard of those thwarting opinions in Religion, that belonged to both Nations, not any way to be reconciled, but by some seeming compliance; since the Egyptians were esteemed most zealous above other Countreys, in the manner of their Worship of the Gods; and for that reason most interessed, in the affections and proceedings of the great Arch-Flamin of Delphus: This some dayes attendance at last procured, in his Bed-chamber; where after he had kissed the Kings hands with all the Ceremonies, appertaining to the Dignity of his person, and the customs of that Nation, he humbly saluted him also with this speech in the Egyptian Language, which Creses had perfectly learned in his infancy, by reason of his education in some of those Countreys: Most mighty Monarch, said he, of the African Empire, whose Dominions be onely bounded with the Suns Circumference, though the Altars of the Gods are ever smoaking with most purest Incense, when other places never flame but in contrary fires, (that rather consume then heat Devotion) since bloud, slaughters, and devastation, are the usual periods of such contestation, seeing opinions rather govern the actions of men, then pacifying obedience rules the will of others; which Religion I may say makes you beloved entirely of that sacred Throne, from whence there ought to be no appeal, but to the highest Heavens, where perpetuity reigns, and omnipotency commands: be pleased therefore to accept a supplication from a Prince, whose youth is adorned with vertues, and his vertues ruled by innocency; yet his injuries cry to the Gods for revenge, as well as his rights to Monarchs for assistance; which same I hope already, hath transported to your sacred ears, though conveniency until now had not the opportunity to redress: But now the blessed peace being obtained to the benefit of the world, every part ought to participate of the good, not onely in your bounty, but from your justice; especially when honour will crown the action, and eternity the piety: If notwithstanding my words are too poor, to obtain the favour, nevertheless let Arethusius Cause be powerful towards your acceptance; so shall your goodness be carried up to Heaven, between the wings of Wisdom and Greatness; since in the one you prevent damage to your own Kingdoms, as in the other shew what you may be able to do when you please. The King however he might be something enflamed by these intimations, as well out of his spleen conceived to the Lydian Nation, in regard, of their attempt upon the Fortunate Island, as his loss of the strong Town of Deorcas ; yet the concernments belonging to a young Prince, outed of his Dominions by the violence of his own Subjects, for no cause but apparent Rebellion, being a people himself hated above measure, took most his apprehension; however for the present, onely putting on an Egyptian gravity, he gave Creses no other answer, but that his chief Officer Alauricus (whom had already concluded the general Peace) understood best the Affairs of all Princes, and should in such convenient time as was fitting, not onely treat with him in particular, but endeavour to render his master satisfied in the general, that could well stand with the safety of his own Empire, with the due Worship of the immortal Gods, which of all things else he desired should be first preferred, as well in other Kingdoms of the world, as in those Territories belonging to his own Government: With these words, and a certain kinde of a nod of his head, according to the Countrey fashion, being the greatest favour he used to any, dismissed Creses from his presence. It was not many dayes before Alauricus the Kings great Favourite (having belike received intimations more particular from his Master) sent for Creses into his house, where after he had welcomed him by something more then ordinary respects, leading him to an inward room, he used this language unto him. Sir, said he, as formerly you and I have discoursed upon this subject, so the King hath enjoyned me now, to let you know his minde more particularly, concerning those affections he bears to your Lord; wherein he shall be ready to shew both his will and his power, provided they be accompanied with the safety of his own honour, upon which depends the greatness and majesty of a Prince; wherefore that I may not deceive my own trust, and yet pleasure you, give me leave to tell you, that upon two basis must be built the foundation of your desires, if you mean to be assisted by our Forces; the one to consider the Hostages you shall offer for Egypts caution, whereby to secure us, that no peace shall be made with the Lydian Commonwealth, without the knowledge and satisfaction of my great Master; since, as you know, both Treasure and Souldiers will abundantly be employed in the service, before that Crown again can be recovered, from those who not onely took away the life of the Father by a most fatal destruction, but probably will maintain the same injustice against the Son, by their strongest resistance; especially having no hopes either in his mercy, or their own repentance; for we cannot but apprehend, what troubles and hazzards appertain to the total subduing of a Nation; witness the fruitful Island of Cyprus , once belonging to our great Lord of Africa, and yet notwithstanding all his power, could never to this day come again to the possession, until at last being over-prest by the Syrian war, he was forced to yield to some conveniencies instead of conquests. The other thing I am to let you know is, our intire resolution to serve the immortal Gods that cannot be effected, unless your King put off his belief of the Lydian Religion, which his Father rather with obstinacy then constancy maintained: With these words he closed up his discourse, by a kinde of a serious frown, that shewed his thoughts meant really what his tongue delivered, whilst in the interim Creses (although he knew himself secretly to be of the Delphine Religion) cast down his looks upon the ground, as not determining well what to answer, considering how difficult a matter it would be, for him to perswade his Master Arethusius to these particulars, without discovering too much his own hidden affections, and believing the Egyptians upon no other determinations, would proceed to any considerable assistance; but at last the Favourite with a more chearful brow, dressing his countenance also in a smile, told him, that by his posture he found his doubtfulness, in the uncertainty of his meaning, notwithstanding there was no disease in nature, but some remedy might be applied, if the Physician and the Simple could correspond. To this purpose, said he, you must give for the Egyptian security, the personall presence of your young Lord Ascanius, Brother to the Crowned King of Myssia ; whereby to remain alwayes at our Court as a pledge; that no underhand-agreement shall be made with the great Senate of Lydia , against our profit, or without Osiris satisfaction, though not there to be kept as a confined Prisoner, but accompanied with this honour, that the chief Admiralty of the Kingdom shall be conferred upon him, not onely in Command but in Benefice, until Arethusius by our assistance, shall either obtain his own Crowns, or hazzard those Forces employed in that service: The second and last Article of necessity will depend upon the resolutions of the holy and mighty Arch-Flamin of Delphos ; not onely because it concerns the Worship of the immortall Gods, whose sacred honour must chiefly be respected by the Egyptian people, but also in regard his power can best perswade (if not command) other Princes, to joyn in some league needful, towards his advantages, either in contributing treasure, or denying his enemies trade: So that I shall conclude with this advice, whereas a Messenger is presently to be dispatched from this City, to the great Lord of the Delphine Worship, with Letters of Congratulation concerning the happy Peace; you may in that company make a journey to Delphos , the better to assure that holy Father, of the right temper of your Prince, since his education from his infancy hath been in contrary principles; without whose approbation I know my master cannot be brought to assist, being wholly addicted to observe his desires in all matters of Religion, as believing else the Heavens will not so well bless his actions. Although Greses had some reason to be troubled at these intimations; as well in regard of his want of Commission to proceed in matters of this difficulty, as for that the pressingness of his Masters Affairs, required more then ordinary industry, having small hopes left him from the powerful Nation of the Syrians ; not onely in respect of the approaching glory of the Marriage, but in that there remained still that Contract, which had been made with deceased Hercrombrotus , in a manner again renewed by the Ambassadour continuing at Sardis , yet with something a chearful countenance, he seemed to entertain the motion, however desired time until the next morning, to put his own confused thoughts into a righter posture, both for the Egyptian honour, and for his Masters safety: These words quickly with a few Complements parted them for the present. Creses when he came to his Chamber, considered these particulars; he thought if he went not along with the Messenger to Delphos , the opportunity might be absolutely lost, being certain, Osiris would do nothing in points belonging to Religion, but by the Arch-Flamins grave direction; wherefore resolved to take the journey without any further authority, then by his ordinary Letters of Credence; chusing rather in that service to hazzard his own particular fortune, then shew any want of painful fidelity in Arethusius concernments, when conveniency could not possibly comply with both occasions: and for what appertained to Prince Ascanius person, he would recommend it to the confideration of the King himself, remaining for the present in the Territories of Pamphylia , who might best determine the difficulty; seeing it was neither pressing in regard of time, or necessary, for that probably another hostage would be admitted in his place: With these determinations in some sort he satified his own minde, until the next morning that he acquainted the chief Favourite with his purposes. It was not long after these resolutions, before Creses landed upon the Grecian shore, without any considerable adventure, but what a rough Sea and some persecution by Pyrates brought his particular, and so consequently not many dayes journey after, settled him in that great and famous City of Delphos , where the Holy Tribunal of the world was placed, to hear and determine causes belonging to Princes; from whence there appeared to be no appeal, but to the Gods themselves in their highest Majesty. Creses having a little refreshed his body by rest, and afforded his thoughts instruction by consideration, the first thing he did was to visit the sacred Temples, in order to that vow he had made upon his late conversion, which yet he kept very secret, almost from the knowledge of any, since his Masters affairs held such a room within all his intentions, that scarce would he own that mystery to himself, though other Princes of the same belief were to be actors in the business; such a coward is depraved nature to heroical enterprizes, that contend against sensualities, notwithstanding he had resolved to put on a stronger confidence then other converts, though he feared more the prejudice to his office, then the danger of his person; since every one knew he valued not his life, when the least apprehension of honour was in his minde: But coming at last to Phane belonging to Hercules , he met there with his friend Parismenus , whom formerly he had left at Athens , now a Flamin easily to be distinguished, by the manner of sacrifice he performed; so that concealing himself behinde a Pillar for the present, when all the Ceremonies appertaining to that dayes service were finished, he stept out to salute him with these words: I hope now the Gods will be propitious to my purposes, since I not onely finde my beloved Parismenus in this place, but encounter him with the same resolution in my self. Parismenus after this advertisement, was not long before he took Creses in his armes, shedding tears of joy as well as wonder, instead of any other expressions; until finding the people about them stood something amazedly gazing at those manner of salutations, without other complements, told him, he should be his guest at his house that night, where the conveniency might afford them commodity enough, as well to treat of old matters of their own as to be better satisfied in Arethusius condition: Parismenus habitation was placed near another Temple of Hercules , of which he seemed to be chief Governour, in regard many Priests of Religious Orders, appeared diligently to attend his entrance; but he past by them all without much observance, until he conducted his friend into his Gardens, that truly were beautiful and delightful, if not large and stately; where being seated in a certain Arbour, he received from Creses a particular account of his imployment, whilst in the interim their dinner was preparing, which being also finished, they both repaired to a Gallery well furnished with curiosities, where placing themselves both upon a Couch, Parismenus was induced to make a discourse of his own adventures, since their last parting at the City of Athens . After the religious profession of Joyela within Minerva's Cloysters, said he, at which you were present and my self lost, I resolved to visit this famous City of Delphos , as well to be satisfied in the rarities thereof, as the better to shake off my own grief, for that change of habit had not altered my minde, though the function I had taken upon me, ought to have hindred me from cogitations of that nature; where being arrived, I began to make devotion my practice, though sense oftentimes strongly opposed, until at last as it were wearied with enjoying nothing but idle fancies, or inspired from above by more real thoughts, I wholly forgot all remembrance of the beautiful Nunne, whose intentions in youth had discarded the worlds glory: In this posture, I must say, I entred my self into a certain apprenticeship of imployment, either by sacrificing daily to the Gods, or repairing often to the Flamins Palace; where one time above the rest, observing the discourse of Philogenia , late Queen of the Scythian Kingdom, I became not onely more taken with her behaviour, but finding she resolved speedily of a journey to the Syrian Court, either to accomplish some affairs of her own, or vigorously by her industry to prosecute the general Peace, determined if I could to go along in her company; as well to prosecute Arethusius concernments, according to former injunctions I had to that purpose, or else to satisfie my own curiosity by other travels; since man is scarce ever weary of novelties: But to be short, she hearing on the way, that Mazarius was not at Damascus , but retired to certain Waters for the better recovery of his health, she dispatched me presently to the place of his abode, to present him with a ceremonious complement, knowing that no action could move within that Horizon without his favour: There I remained untill she returned again from the Court, to a Castle belonging to the King, which which was prepared by his command for her reception: Nevertheless at my coming back I found all the Queens house in an uproar, by reason of a sudden execution she caused to be done upon one of her servants, although to this hour the cause be not known: This accident I must tell you made me another time a messenger to the great Favourite, as well to certifie him of the truth of Philogenia's proceedings, as to demand his powerful protection, as I said, that concerned the Honour and Royalty of an absolute Queen; for that in some sort she had broke the Law and Rule of Nations, in not conforming her passions to the legal decorum of the Countrey; which so happily succeeded, that within a few dayes space, I not onely brought her a full discharge for her supposed contempt, but Mazarius himself not long after, followed with a respectful visit, to give a greater testimony to the Kingdom of Syria , what estimation was to be had of Philogenia's person in all the Territories belonging to Orontes Government: In this manner, I may say, I came first into the knowledge of that great Minister of State, and so by degrees into his intimate and special favour; until at last he not onely conferred upon me this Dignity I now enjoy, but imployed me soon after in the command of those Priests of the Syrian Nation, which you saw at our entrance into the house, by means whereof, I have totally left the service of the young Queen; though she hearing of the sudden death of Dogalphus the Scythian King, is come since to this City of Delphos ; but with less credit then formerly, occasioned, either by reason of the sudden slaughter was committed upon her servant, or being overpowered by the Egyptian factions, they seem to contradict her in all her designs; not onely in her former esteem with the Holy Flamin , but also in every action she can pretend unto: And this is almost all I can relate at the present of our affairs, but what expectation the general peace may bring to our hopes; onely one mystery more I shall acquaint you withal, belonging to our master the great King of Lydia , whose interest I must ever endeavour to advance, with the hazzard of my life, notwithstanding the habit you see me wear, might seem to challenge some protection from temporal imbroilments, if not his disaffection to our Religion, no way encouraging my hopes to appear before him, whereby to become any thing near his heart, when so many are about his Royal person, contrary to our faith in the Worship of the Gods; and perhaps too much spight me already for the very act of my conversion; nevertheless thus much I shall say for your information: You know, said he, that a long prosecution hath been to make a match between the Prince we speak of, and the fair Daughter of Orestes by his second Wife, whose fortune either exceeded her beauty, or her beauty graced her fortune, and therefore could expect no less then such a Husband, whereby in every kinde to suit her condition with endowments: But he, whether more in love with his resolution to conquer again the Lydian Kingdom to his subjecton, or by nature not being given as yet to those dalliances of repose, scarce at any time lent an ear to the propositions, which perhaps hath been no small occasion to keep him out of the Syrian Dominions; since exasperations in matters of female Courtship, upon suspected refusals, for the most part prove either prodigious or irreconcileable: However Orestes is since dead, and so by consequence his posterity is not to be much feared, when as he hath left behinde him none but Daughters, which by the Laws of Syria cannot inherit; where by Androminda fortifying the Title with two Sons, gives a most certain quiet to the peoples thoughts. But Mazarius the mighty Favourite, whether grown more confident by these accidents, or being higher inflamed by his success in the late conclusion of Peace, between the sometimes exasperate Monarchs, hath anew set his thoughts on fire, by more sublime ambitions, when he dares propound a Neece of his own, in competition with the rich Daughter of Orestes Family: In short, I am designed a speedy Messenger into the Countrey of Pamphilia , to propound the Match to be effected, where Arethusius with his fair Sister the Princess Cloria now remains, expecting those opportunities, that may again return them both to their own Dominions, which Mazarius vowes shall be performed with all expedition, provided these Overtures and his private affections may be entertained with love and confidence. O Heavens, cryed out Creses , what surfeits of ambition are contained in the intrails of the world, when mixtures of Sovereigns and Subjects, be so boldly demanded, if not more confidently expected; but 'tis no matter Parismenus , said he, if she be handsome and good; for Crowns can maintain dignity, and the Favourite give riches; onely it is my part, to follow those designs I came hither to agitate, which already I have related unto you, hoping by your means, to obtain an audience from the great Flamine : Nevertheless, replied Parismenus , I fear the successful progress of your affairs, in regard of the contrariety of Religion, since this holy Tribunal, doth not use to be interested, but where the Gods Worship may be advanced; so that I pray let me know more particularly, what the propositions are you intend to offer this State, that I may consider of the surest way to serve your occasions: Truly, said Creses , we desite, either some Treasures from this bountiful and rich Magazine of wealth, or such an indulgent aspect from this Temple, that may unite generally, other States and Kingdoms in the recovery of the Lydian Crowns; since true piety cannot be without justice; and just it is, that young Arethusius should again be settled in his Throne, torn from his possession in his Fathers blood, and kept at the present violently by the basest of his people in that Region; where nothing governs but Tyranny, covetousness keeping the key of all proceedings: 'Tis true, answered Parismenus , these are crimes of the highest nature, though misfortunes the Heavens have been content to own. But Creses , said he, if the Subjects of the Delphine opinion, have received more protection under this now confused Government, then when King Euarchus peaceably ruled, notwithstanding his tyes to Hyacinthia the Queen, how can you possibly expect a favourable hearing from this Court, busied as you know with designs, that may propagate the true Worship of the Gods, and the tranquility of such, who are humble suitors to their divine mysteries. This necessary and faithful information of Parismenus , being entertained by wise and discreet Creses , gave him occasion to make this discourse. Dear friend, said he, I cannot deny, but the Lydian Laws decreed against the innocent professors of the Delphine Rites, were both cruel and bloody, not onely belonging to the Priest but the people of the Nation; since as the first were to suffer death comming into the Kingdom, so the others living there, were necessarily compelled to quit their belief, or sacrifice all they had to the worst of covetousness; being onely framed then the better to secure the Crown upon the old Queen of Lydia's head; for that her Title came to be questioned, by the authority of this sacred Temple of Delphos ; nevertheless it is well known, when Euarchus by a just Succession came to the Government, although the force of the Decrees lasted still, yet the rigour of the punishments were much abated, until the great Senate over-powering of his Prerogative, all those particular Laws were put in execution, with all violence; since their judgements were not prosecuted by ordinary and legal courses, but according to the interested, or ignorant fancies, of such as were employed, rather arbitrarily then knowingly; when as the execution ever exceeded the sentence, contrary to the general maxime of charity, that mercy of the two extreams, should alwayes out-weigh Justice: But said Parismenus , I have heard of the contrary, that there is a certain kinde of people now of greatest power in the Government, who disallow any manner of violence, used for any Religion or Opinion, and so consequently, would not prejudice those of our Faith. Truly Sir, replied Creses , that's a meer fallacy not understood by many, to get the better being, and countenance for the inferiour sort of Subjects, who for the most part are confused in their professions, as disorderly in their obedience; their pride scarce suffering them to live under any Dominion; so that because they cannot attain to the highest preferments, they would square all things to their own level; but if by chance they come to command in any Jurisdiction, (which some of them do in these unworthy and distracted times) none rules more domineeringly, or exacts more covetously; setting then aside all indifferencies in matters of Religion and Opinion, if the least advantage appear to themselves by the bargain: So that I shall desire you not to deceive your self, in believing these people act or promise any moderation, but when either nothing is to be had, or all is taken away already; witness their late proceedings in the Island of Crete , where after the slaughter of most of the Priests, they have transported all the inhabitants of the Delphine Religion into other quarters, (without any manner of crime committed) whilst their Lands and Estates are disposed to common Souldiers, or people of their own Interest and Faction; whereby many noble Families are utterly undone, that formerly were accustomed to relieve the poor, and countenance the rich: Therefore judge you Parismenus , I say, if it be not more profitable for the holy Flamin of Delphos to favour and protect a lawful King, (whose gallantry cannot be equalled in his years, or his vertue in other persons) in those just Rights that belong to his successions; though his professions seemingly (for his greater safety) may a little thwart the present strictness of this mighty Tribunal, (since his marriage or obligation in time probably, must needs bring ease, and procure emunities to those of the Delphine opinion) then to trust the fantastical uncertainties of such people, who (besides the cruelty they have already shewed upon all occasions) have neither limitation of their covetousnes, not bonds in their Government; changing when they please, and never to the better. Over and above I must tell you, that as no promises nor contracts have been lately observed, within the Lydian Dominion, either with Prince or Subject; so of the other side, I desire you not onely to consider, but to know with assuredness, that both my self and many more of the nobler sort, have lately altered their Worship of the Gods, and yet retain no contemptible esteem, in the bosome and opinion of Prince Arethusius : No Parismenus , said he, Royalty is the best Subject to the holy Temple of Delphos , seeing Monarchy hath the nearest resemblance of the Heavenly Government, when order and ordination in a single power rules, onely by subordinate Instruments, directing their end to one honourable period; whereas Anarchy produceth nothing but confusion in obedience, and Atheism in belief; seeing pride amongst the common people, is ever accompanied with ignorance, and seldom without cruelty; besides a fatal kinde of inconstancy in their natures, that can never hold long under any decorum, although it be altogether of their own chusing; and so consequently in matters of Religion of all others most dangerous: Parismenus in the latter part of his discourse beheld him stedfastly in the face; but when he had done embracing him in his arms, he uttered these words: And is it possible, said he, that Creses is become of the Delphine opinion, when formerly both his dainty wit and his passionate interest, made him alwayes so strong a contender against all those principles? Now I see, though ever believed, the omnipotent goodness of the immortal Gods, who work their effects hiddenly contrary to expectation, that men may the more be confirmed, not onely in their power, but of their intentions: This being delivered, he presently conducted Creses into his private Cabinet, where he shewed him many rare Meddals, that his curiosity had collected during his abode in the City of Delphos ; where looking upon one above the rest most remarkable for antiquity, they found the impression of Saturn , whilst in the Island of Crete he taught Husbandry, to the ignorant and admiring people; which gave occasion to Creses to question the vanity of opinions, in that a man known to be mortal, accompanied with many other imperfections in nature, should not onely be esteemed a God, but in a manner the very Father of them all: unto which Parismenus quickly returned him this answer. 'Tis true, said he, not onely Saturn and Jupiter , but other inferiour persons, were at the first by the rude multitude deemed Deities, from the Benefices the world had received in their inventions, which succession confirmed by the power and authority of those of their Race, that came after, whereby the better to be obeyed, and keep up their own veneration amongst their Subjects; however as worthy Heroes have their reward by the great Maker of Heaven and Earth, so the names of several Gods being onely Attributes belonging to his Divinity, we worship and adore them by those denominations; since there can be but one onely omnipotent Commander, and Ruler of all things: for as the success of War is ascribed to Mars , Chastity to Diana , and the Muses to Apollo ; so these vertues commendable, proceeding from the operation and pleasure of this infinite essence, that cannot be seen or known but in his Attributes, the names of Gods are applied to them, that people may be the more addicted to their prosecution; when also some eminent men and women in these properties, have been upon the earth, and so generally came to be Gods, in regard of the excellency both of their actings and their persons: However, as I say, no divine Worship and Sacrifice, can belong but to one onely Deity; at leastwise so relatively to be understood and intended: Besides you see the Stars bear these names, for no other reason, but that some principal denomination should be given to their influence, as well to make their course better observed, as to render the Science of Astronomy lasting; though I must confess the multitude sometimes thought they conversed upon earth in familiarity and bodily shape, which took more their fancy, however destroyed their faith, an errour onely to be corrected by instruction: But I pray, said Creses , what are the opinions here in Delphos , of such, who by their deserving employments, have attained to the heavenly reward? because they pretend in Lydia , that you not onely pray but sacrifice to those lesser Deities, as to the great God of all Creations and Power. My good friend, answered Parismenus , we do but make our supplications to those happy creatures, that they may be Intercessours in our behalf, to that omnipotent eternity, who made both them and us; supposing they are absolutely in his favours, which we living upon earth cannot presume to think, carrying about us so many defects of flesh and blood; but for sacrificing to their particular, though often we call Altars by their names, for the better distinctions; yet are our Offerings alwayes directed onely to God himself, since no Creature how worthy soever, can participate of his Divine Right, being an essential due belonging to him alone. Well, well, Parismenus , said Creses , let us leave off now any more disputations of Divinity, and fall a little to consideration of Morality; to which purpose I must conjure your friendship, as soon as you can by your interest, to procure me a hearing from the great Flamin , whereby those requests I have to offer in Prince Arethusius behalf, may be entertained with efficacy, and consequently he put in some capacity of acting, according to the justness of his Cause, and the nobleness of his nature; until when, I must tell you, the world suffers in dishonour, as other Potentates, as I believe, in Conscience; since not onely in the general, Religion is in danger by the omission, but all Kingdoms in hazzard of adulteration, considering the force and violence of a Phanatick spirit, which reigns in the thoughts and desires of the common people. Not many dayes after this communication, Parismenus one morning being the Holy Festival of Apollo , conducted Creses to a Temple belonging to the Palace of the great Flamin : The structure it self was of an oval form, adorned on the outside, by many statues cut in white Marble, with a Portico at the entrance, raised upon Pillars of Corinthian Work: at the several doors appeared people, standing to expect the coming forth of the chief Bishop, whereby to receive his blessing as he should issue out, according to the custom of the time, to make an orderly procession, with all the great Priests of the City: but Parismenus being sufficiently acquainted with the Captain of the Guard, procured presently admittance, both for himself and Creses , into the very body of the Temple, where at some distance they might behold, the grave Father sitting upon his Throne, and wearing a golden Mytre on his venerable head, crowned already with silver hairs, that added much reverence (in the beholders opinion) to the sanctity of his looks. The further end of the Chappel near the high Altar, was painted all over with divers figures, representing the Gods fitting in Judgement, upon the crimes of men of this world, every ones faults appearing to the imagination, by the countenances shewed in the workmanship, most lively represented in the contrivance either less or more, according to the censure given against them; again, others were seen to express joy in their looks, as if favourable dooms were pronounced, concerning their particulars: besides several sorts of tortures were there beheld, so daintily shadowed to terror and amazement, that scarce could the innocent viewers be freed from fear, although they knew their persons no way liable to the prejudice, both by reason of distance in place, as knowledge of impossibility; however nature could not chuse but a little tremble (overcome as it were by the force of apprehensions) onely in seeing those similitudes but well painted, which by better recollection they were sure never to undergo. Of either side the Holy Flamin were ordered other Princes in seats, appertaining to the Temple of the Oracle, wearing red garments with silver Mytres, though each distinguished in his habit and office; who after they had performed a small sacrifice, went all with Incense in their hands, to conduct the Arch-Flamin to a more majestick tribunal; where presently putting on a tripple Crown, he was carried in a Litter, to the great Temple of God Apollo , whilst the religious people on either hand received his benediction: The statue dedicated to that Deity was composed all of Ivory, so neatly wrought together by little parcels, that in effect it appeared to be one onely piece, notwithstanding it was of a prodigious greatness, placed upon a huge pedestal of Brass, under which is the entrance into that horrid Cave, from whence proceeds the admirable and dreadful predictions, that all the earth not onely fears, but obeyes; at whose feet a small Altar being erected, the Holy Father there performed a gentle, though ceremonious offering, in thanks for the great and general peace, concluded between the two mighty Monarchs of the world; and then returned to his Palace again, whilst the Priests and people sung hymnes of praise and joy all the way as he went. These Triumphs being ended with artificial fire-works at night, wherein were expressed more then ordinary skill; on the day after was proclaimed, not onely a general pardon to every sort of condition, but a gracious audience to all manner of Majestrates, with the feasting and entertainment of several Ambassadours, which gave an unexpected opportunity to Creses , to present his requests to the great Flamin , who was seated in his private Chamber, upon a commodious Chair, under a rich Canopy of State, covered at the bottom by a Velvet Carpet, interseamed with Pearle and Gold: At his entrance he presently fell on his knees, performing such usual Adorations, as were accustomed to that Holy Presence; but being further encouraged to a prosecution of his intentions, by a gentle, though grave smile, Creses with a most earnest tongue, uttered this language in the hearing of other persons belonging to the Temple of Delphos . Most sacred dispencer, said he, of the Delphine Laws, and onely interpreter of the Gods mysteries; whose judgements even shut and open the Cristaline Gates of Olympus , and give pardons frequently to the erring world, as condemnation to the obstinate unrepentant sinner; the blessed breath by your power with hopes of eternal fruitions, as wickedness cannot much prevail because you are alwayes good: Ignorances by your revelations become corrected, and your self by sanctity of life still preserved: The Oracles by your authority ever speak, and your definitions render them infallibly understood: Your judgement stills all controversies in pure obedience, which makes the property more acceptable then the best Hecatombs offered in Temples: Princes in your jurisdiction become glorious and happy, when Tyrants at your frowns are amazed into despair. I must say notwithstanding, most Holy Father, that these miraculous influences at the present are obscured, for that a person whose youth never contemplated ill thoughts, his vertues be debarred of all right, can receive no assistance: O let not a Jubile be granted here to men, as long as Arethusius stands unrelieved by other Princes, whose duty it is to revenge his quarrel; may all marriages be forbid, until the gallant King of Lydia be again established in his Throne; since the example of that prodigie, almost strikes at omnipotency it self: What means Affrica and Asia to enterchange Nuptials with such solemnities, when their honour bleeds in Arethusius injuries? when as the seeming apprehension of so fatal a disaster, should make them fear plagues upon both their prosperities: But to you great Protector of Divine Principles, I come with most confidence to be understood; because as your thoughts are alwayes imployed towards heroical acts, so is your power able to perswade (if not controul) Monarchs themselves, though your mildness be still shewed in their accommodations: Treasure we desire out of your Holy Coffers, and Ambassadours we seek from this famous City, whereby young, brave, and vertuous Arethusius , may recover to his possession, those Royal Crowns, which your enemies as well as his, have withheld so long a time by usurp't authority; since the countenance that hath been given to Lydia's rebellion by forreign States, not onely struck great Euarchus his fatal blow, but renders his Son a wanderer through the earth, accompanied by his own vertues, whilst other baser souls feed upon their wilde luxuries; he scorning supplies to any other purpose, then to revenge his brave Fathers blood, if not settle those Countreys belonging to his particular, in some lasting posterity, adorned with those ancient flowers of Piety and Religion, which once they enjoyed above other places: wherefore if your Majestick Holiness will contribute to these endeavours, as sanctity now governs your Temples, glory will shine upon your Throne, when an injured Princes obligations shall establish your goodness to all eternity; attributes deserving such a ruler, who moderates his actions with wisdom, and inflames the effects by zeal, charity being the motive, and bounty the instrument. When Creses had made an end of this short oration, the Flamin beheld him with another smiling countenance, gravity dressing it self in a most becoming posture; however for the present he onely let him know, that as considerations of distressed suppliants were subjects proper for Delphos tribunal, so were the sufferings and qualities of his Master augmentations to his thoughts, for the speedier and more effectual proceedings; nevertheless other great Flamins of the City were to be judges of Princes affairs, whose Councels were alwayes directed by religious intentions, though disputed in common assemblies; wherefore wisht him to rest satisfied with some patience, until the other important affairs of the World were better settled, since most Dominions of Asia and Affrica , were to be contributers in Arethusius necessities: However this answer (more cool then Creses expected) gave not his opinion so clear a life, as his hopes and fancies sometimes promised, yet knowing it was the custom of that Holy Court, to demur a while upon all motions presented, was content at the instant, to flatter up his imaginations with pleasing conjectures, instead of being over-pressing in his solicitations; especially when he knew it was favour, and not contention, that could bring prosperity and success to his own Embassie; so resolved to sit still, although he intended daily to make his supplications to those Officers, which he was informed remained at the sterne of transactions, in that great and magnificent Theatre, where business like deluges flowed with violence, gathering at last into a sea of intelligence, though the orders that were observed by that religious State, gave in a manner a miraculous cure, before any ill or inconveniencies could be perceived. Creses in this manner, as I say, determining a while to be passive, until the cloud of business were a little dispersed, became perswaded by Parismenus , to give in the interim Philogenia the Queen of Scythia a visit; not onely as a civility belonging to his place and employment, but as an essential benefit that might happen to Arethusius affairs; not onely in regard of her many professions in his behalf, but also for that King Dogalphus being lately dead, who received his Crown and Government from her donation, she probably again might return to her old Jurisdiction; since as she formerly quittd her Titles but to satisfie her peoples desires, so now that obstacle appearing removed, factions might arise, and obedience become destroyed, whereby again to make her Queen of Scythia as well in Government as Name; by which means Arethusius also would be strengthened in his prosecutions, as well by debarring the Lydians from that assistance they expect, as to make that Nation become his friends; it being very well known, this Heroical Lady, would never contract a disadvantage to his particular, having suffered so much injury by his Fathers disobedient Countreymen, who have with-held him from his Right so long a time by an unexampled cruelty; wherein, I may say, all the Princes of the world suffer in dishonour: He added further, that as Hercrombrotus had formerly engaged the people of the Scythians to his party, by reason of Dogalphus Conquest, and his own fortune, so the Senate of Lydia intends to confirm the same friendship, if the Factions already arising within that Kingdom, do not hinder their design by bringing Queen Philogenia again into Command amongst the people; not improbable to be effected, for that both the King of Armenia and many other Princes, are now in actual Arms, to revenge the destruction made in the Territories of Trapasus , with an unjust and treacherous Invasion, complained on by all sorts of conditions in that Countrey: These reasons I may say of Parismenus , besides his own civilities, invited Creses , to bestow a visit upon the gallant Lady; however her late retirements scarce gave him the conveniency, in regard of some controversies hapning between her self and the great Arch-Flamine , whose office 'twas to be regular and punctual in all his actions, though her person was no way distasteful to his thoughts, since he remembred she had left her glorious Crown, to become his most humble penitent, in her willing obedience to the famous and sacred Temple of Delphos . To this purpose Creses , within two or three dayes being introduced to a private Audience, found the Queen sitting in a Chair, before a Table covered with black, as also the Room seemed to wear the same Livery, by reason of the late death of her near Kinsman the King of Scythia ; whose fortunes were now ended in the last period, the Gods had ordained for Mortality, though to what Judgement-seat he was brought, may be some question, since the best of humane kinde cannot be without hazzard; and ambition for the most part accompanies conquest; Titles being tryed oftner by the sharpness of the Sword, then the scale and ballance of Justice; where indulgency rather enflameth the fancy, then consideration examineth the Conscience; and so consequently actions become desperate: Nevertheless Philogenia mourned his quality, though perhaps not his fate; seeing his wars deprived her of those pensions, she had so richly bought with loss of Crowns, now again likely to be redeemed with more right, and less danger; for that Armenia began to be a weary of that Northern Government, which they knew could gain much, and unpossible to lose any thing. 'Tis true, the glorious Queen was exercising her studies, upon the naked body of a Sphear, with a pair of Compasses in her hands, as if she meant to measure the earths distances, either thereby to value heaven the better, or to compute her own losses by the Circumference; but as Creses entred the Chamber, she left all to comply courteously with his addresses; whereupon presently rose from her place, whilst he humbly made his approaches to kiss the bottom of her Robe; which having done, he saluted her with this language. Madam, said he, the obligation of Prince Arethusius to your dignity and vertues, hath commanded my attendance at present upon your Royal Person; not onely to thank you for your favours past, that have out-done his merits by your large recommendations, but reflecting upon the duty of my office, most humbly desire a continuance of your glorious actions, since nothing can be more obvious to the world, then for one Monarch to assist another, either in distresses or friendship; for whilst that appears, people look at Majesty shining with Rayes of Power, not to be attempted by any but heaven or fate, until the earths dissolution: The Queen all this while, beheld his countenance with a most constant look, as if she meant to read his ability in his demeanour, until at last she returned him this answer. If gallant though suffering Arethusius were a stranger to the world, something might be said for other Princes neglects; but since his greatest bravery consists in his misfortunes, like excellent Diamonds that have been tryed by the Anvil, that sparkle with more lustre, it were a shame in me not to be pardoned by the Gods, to suffer his worth to sleep in oblivion; when Crowns and Kingdoms I could part withall, to purchase a poorer honour, then what that young Hero hath already gained to his particular; wherefore be assured, that what Philogenia can do in his behalf, must ambitiously be sought by the Scythian Queen, as well for her own sake, as his private benefit; since as all Justice is a duty to every one, so shall his esteem be more then an obligation; especially in her thoughts, who wishes again to govern but for his advantage: With these words she smilingly took him by the hand, as if by that familiarity she intended to confirm his opinion. Creses with these expressions, was not onely content in his minde, but ravisht in his thoughts, coming from a Queen, whose Gallantry was a sufficient testimony to his belief; for although her power was to be encreased by fortune, yet her promise would be constant like the stars: So that not having words to express his thanks, he took her white hand, adoring the object first with his eyes, and then gently putting it to his lips, did as it were contemplate the subject in a few tears of joy, in regard the world had not lost all its honour and goodness: But long it was not before Philogenia brought out from her Cabinet, a Letter which she said was lately received from the chief Majestrates of the Kingdom of Scythia , when reading the Contents, it spake these particulars.  Madam, as we cannot enough bewail the untimely death of your near Kinsman our Royal King, though more for his valour in the wars, then the benefit he brought to the Nation by his undertakings; since truly our purses have paid the expence, in contracting enmities with other people, instead of that rich Trading our Countrey stood in need of; so of the other side, the confusion we now suffer by reason of his sons age, and the souldiers violence, the people are struck with a kinde of despair, in all their hearts, and cannot be remedied, unless you shall be pleased, either to take upon you again the Government, or contribute some endeavours with other Princes, whereby we may become secure and peaceable; wealth being wanting, and ambition too prevalent; besides the destruction of men and provision, by reason of the late slaughters, that have been made every where, not onely in this particular Dominion, but round about all the borders of this frozen Clymate; so that our enemies are exasperated, our Allyes wearied, and the people terrified, no way to be rectified as we conceive, but either by the Gods mercy, or your goodness; when as Lydia is not onely now upon new Principles, whose friendship hitherunto we enjoyed, but Syria breaking off their old protection, in regard of their late contract, or intended Marriage, which shuts up all in their present Triumphs, rather then considers our necessities: Wherefore most excellent Queen, who left Crowns to enjoy honour, afford pitty to gain heaven; and in those thoughts, remember your own birth, and forget our ingratitudes, whereupon Monuments will be raised to your name, and we subsist by your favour, to live or dye according to your pleasure.  When she had read these lines, she smiled again, as if she obraided her Subjects want of wisdom, as well as their lack of Loyalty; concluding with these expressions, that if ever her fortunes answered her intentions, she would serve Prince Arethusius by all her power; promising not onely to take but snatch every occasion, that might render his Cause justifiable, in the hearts and opinions of greatest Potentates in the world; by daily solicitation of the holy Flamin in his particular, though for the instant she found her Interest not much favoured by the Court; however hoped e're long to obtain the Flamins pardon, if not by her humility prayers, yet at leastwise in the general Jubile, which after some other complements, parted Creses from her presence. But Parismenus , whose diligence to instruct and accompany Creses in his affairs, had a little protracted his haste towards the injunctions of the great Favourite Mazarius , began now again to think of his journey into the Countrey of Pamphylia , where he was informed his Master Prince Arethusius remained, free from hazzard, though not from care; for however the nobleness of the Egyptian natures proved his defence and subsistance, yet could not his courage be satisfied with any thing but revenge; wherefore he resolved upon the next conveniency, to begin his unwilling voyage: To this purpose hearing a Ship was ready at the City of Athens , after he had received the commands of Queen Philogenia , he quickly imbarqued with a prosperous winde, which continued him sufficiently contented for three or four dayes space, until at last a storm arising near the Island of Crete , the Marriners were forced to put into a harbour belonging to the Lydian Government: Parismenus being there with something a tedious expectation, without finding any commodity for a new transportation, he resolved in the end by a disguise, to pass through the Countreys by Land, unto the place of his intended design; not fearing to be suspected by reason of the change of his habit, that was more rustick then ordinary to avoid discovery; since he knew it was esteemed (by the Laws of Lydia ) the highest capital offence, for a Priest of the Delphine Religion, to be taken in those Territories under the Senates jurisdiction: Nevertheless, whether he was over confident in his conversation, or the company being too curious after his quality, in regard of the suspicion of the times, one night resting in his bed at the City of Smyrna , he was seized by two Majestrates or Officers of the Town; insomuch as after a short examination by their officiousness (their wits perhaps not able further to prevail) he was conveyed by a strong Troop of Horse, up to the great Metropolitan of Sardis ; where again being interrogated with a more exact scrutiny, not onely his person but his function were discovered, to the full view of most, which soon made him a prisoner in the fortified Castle. Parismenus , as I said, being thus inclosed contrary to his expectation, became extreamly tormented in his thoughts, for that he was debarred from acting in his Masters quarrels; as also troubled with fear of his own condemnation, knowing both the Decrees and those Judges were exasperated against his Religion; the likelier to be augmented, in regard Prince Arethusius began again to stir in the Countrey of Pamphylia: But whilst he had opportunity onely to work with diversities of his own fancies, since the guard that had the charge of his particular, were watchful enough towards the execution of their office, Hermelaus the Myssian General came to the City of Sardis , having in part moulded his Army to his own content, though not to their liking, who rather desired liberty then reformation; for as the one added a restraint to their intended insolency, so the other forced a kinde of obedience to a single jurisdiction: but as I say, when he arrived he presently went to the Senate, to pay in a certain kinde of duty to their seeming authority, though his heart entirely ran along with the peoples Liberties; since long it was not before he placed again in the Councel, those Senators that the Armis violence had formerly seized upon, not onely to the destruction of the King, but to the enslaving of the Nation: This being done to the joy of the Town of Sardis , whose wealth consisted in trade, as trade was maintained by order, the Senate instantly framed these constitutions, to more peace and better Government; that a new Assembly should presently be summoned, as well to dissolve that, which had been so fatally destructive to good Euarchus life, as to give another a better Legality and Authority, either by the complying with Arethusius Titles, or acknowledging of the Noblemens Priviledges; who onely sate to perpetuate their own glories, and gloried in nothing more then in witless tyranny: However Hermelaus , whose experience in command, had made him doubtful of the Souldiers actions, knowing they wanted no instigation both of pride and perswasion, by those old Officers that were disbanded, because they would not yield willing obedience to his honest principles, caused to be proclaimed a new Declaration, wherein he willed all them to depart the City, that did not engage to be as well temperate as quiet, until the other Assembly should take the Government of the whole Nation, in whose judgements onely rested the future settlement, either of King or Commonwealth: This being not performed by the late General Abactanus , imployed against Tellanor and Timon , whose stomach could not brook any other chief Captain but himself, he was instantly sent to a strong Fort to be safely kept; at leastwise that he might do no more hurt, since it was well known he intended to do no good, accompanied also with some inferiour Commanders, who had raised their fortunes better by the Lands of Euarchus the King, then by their own valour in the Field. These proceedings, I may say, not onely released many of Arethusius friends out of prison, that envy had detained, rather then their crimes, but also gave appetites to Parismenus , to think of some freedom to himself, either by escape or supplication; to which purpose hearing the Syrian Ambassadour, remained yet within the Territories of Lydia , according to his Commission, resolved to demand his assistance, or come to his communication, wherein he expected a double benefice to his particular, by his authority or advertisement; supposing, that as he was an intrusted messenger, imployed by the policy of the great and mighty Favourite Mazarius , to whom also his own affairs belonged; so of the other side, could he be no enemy to Monarchy in the general, upon which he conceived his present confinement chiefly appertained. Whilst many fancies in the interim did perturbate the thoughts of some, and gave encouragement to others of another faction, Abactanus broke suddenly from his imprisonment, to the satisfaction of that party, that most appeared averse to the Royal Interest; wherefore presently the Councel that was established by the Authority of the late dissolved Senate, not onely caused search to be made, within all the suspicious places about the great City of Sardis , but issued forth several proclamations, to command diligence, and promise reward, to any person that could give intelligence, either of his being or his reception; besides the General Hermelaus sent divers of his own Troops into that Fort, that had been too negligent to suffer so eminent an escape to be made from their jurisdiction, to the endangering of new troubles in the whole Nation; in the interim the Army being willing to subscribe a particular content in his proceedings, which was to rest satisfied with the next congregated Senate; and so consequently to determine, what Government was to be established over the whole Dominion: This I may say gave further hopes to Parismenus designs, since as of one side it afforded him freer communication with the Souldiers, being partly of Prince Arethusius faction; so of the other side, was he permitted to discourse at his pleasure, with whom should be admitted into the body of the fortified Castle; until it at last procured him, to visit the Syrian Minister of State, who yet kept a near correspondency with the Lydian Affairs, either for old interest or more discovery; which was the occasion, that one day the Ambassadour and he being both seated together in a pleasant Banquetting-house, belonging to that witty persons dwelling, after many passages and reparties, he fell upon a general relation of the Treaty and conclusion of Peace, between the two mighty Monarchs of the world; also how in particular, it might concern the interest, and quiet of other lesser Princes: Although Parismenus had not at all made him acquainted with his imployment, being intended onely for the Countrey of Pamphylia , however interrupted by his own unexpected surprizal, by a party of the Lydian Fleet, when he was sailing near the shore of the Island of Grete . The agreement, said the Ambassadour, concluded between the two Kings, Orontes and Osiris , by the wise deportment of their chief Ministers of State, doth not onely give ease and felicity to their own Subjects, but security to the greatest part of the known world; since as of one side, Trapasus and the Scythians are again united in their wonted friendship, so of the other side Astratius and Condorosus are restored to their liberty; the one to his Countreys enjoyment, and the other to his Princes favour; (each pleased in his quiet and fortune) when after so long a time of trouble and hazzard, they are put in possession of a secure station, alwayes to be improved by an honest industry, if their own ambitions in the future, do not hinder the intention, either in themselves or others; onely the injured Lady Amarillia , as some expiation of her too much guilt, hath in a tedious sickness paid nature her due; however her Children are now brought into Syria , there to be nourished with all honour that our gallant Countrey can afford, to render them capable of any preferment, the Gods or fate will cast upon them; who perhaps may inherit their Fathers Dominions, although his too much inconstancy of disposition, gives more cause of fear then hopes to any pretention. The Prince of Arabia hath also, not onely received a bountiful satisfaction, in all his Territories from the King of Egypt , but made a beneficial league with every neighbouring State, whereby he is become both rich and powerful; which being adorned by a flourishing youth, he is afforded a full conveniency, to marry where he pleaseth for his greater advantage; since scarce a Lady of Asia remains, but will covet the alliance, rather with passion then temper: Last of all concerning the Princess Cloria's affairs, whose differences in the Land of Cyprus with her Mother-in-law, made her travel in her thoughts, with a kinde of a tormenting vexation, since the death of her brave Lord and Husband; our great Favourite Mazarius finding by her unexampled humanity, his Nephew Manchinus was preserved from destrnction (a story too long now to be related in particular) hath not onely caused our King Orontes , to take upon him the Patronage of all her Estate, but hath restored her Son to the honour of his Fathers Government, by compelling the people to chuse him Prince of the Countrey of Cyprus ; where she at the present remains, accompanied with all the felicity in outward shew the earth can afford: These effects, I may say, the happy union I have mentioned hath procured, to all persons concerned in the differences of former times. When the Ambassadour had delivered thus much, Parismenus in a kinde of a melancholly look, cast down his eyes upon the ground, as being discontented seemingly, that no mention was made in this grand Jubile, of the concernments of his Master Arethusius , since his Title and Rights appeared of more consequence to the world, then all the other settlements of the Asian Dominions; which at last with a sigh or two brought forth this reply. 'Tis true, said he, these glorious endeavours of the mighty Favourite Mazarius , have in all probability won him a fame beyond mens expectation, in regard it was thought to be his inward determinations, never to conclude a general peace, (Statesmen seldom executing that which they pretend in outward shew) yet methinks his endeavours had been more nobly crowned, if the King of Lydia's affairs also had been settled, either by composition or conquest; at leastwise carried with them the promises and determinations of the two great Monarchs to be his assistance in so just and good a cause. Unto which the Ambassadour presently made this answer: My friend, my friend, said he, there are more mysteries depend upon that business, then either is known to the world, or is fit as yet to be revealed to many; onely rest you satisfied for some time, and mark what issue will be produced. Although this sudden caution of the Ambassadour, turned them quickly into another subject of discourse; nevertheless Parismenus going homeward towards the Fort (for notwithstanding he had procured a certain kinde of liberty to his person, by reason of the favourable change of things, yet was he still restrained by the obligation of his word) began seriously to reflect upon the substance of his own imployment, wherein he computed the Favourites ambition, to have his Neece to bear the name of a Queen; together with the necessities of Prince Arethusius affairs, not to be remedied as he thought, but by the power and interest of Mazarius that governed the whole. These cogitations cast him into a little despair, considering, that without the proposition of the match, the business could not be effected; and himself being in prison could not have the conveniency to perform it, which was not to be rectified by any industry: With these troubles he continued many dayes accompanied (since he neither durst speak the secret was recommended to his charge, whereby to convey the execution to another, or found his own ability in any capacity to perform that trust, which of necessity was to be performed) until again one afternoon, the Ambassadour sent for him to his house. Long it was not after his arrival, before the crafty Minister of State, conducting him into a private with drawing room, began this discourse to his hearing. Not many weeks since, said he, I let you know my minde, concerning the effects of the general peace, now concluded between the two mighty Monarchs of the World, Orontes King of Syria , and Osiris Prince of Egypt , wherein other Commonwealths have also their share of commodity, if not of glory; however your young King of Lydia appears not yet to be remembred; but at present a latter scene being discovered, I shall inform you of some more particulars, belonging to his interest and profit, which before neither your office or my imployment, would suffer me to reveal: The two Kings meeting, as I say, upon the Frontiers of both Countreys, to consummate the much desired marriage, between the Lady Hesperiana and our youthful Sovereign, there arrived of a sudden at the Court Prince Arethusius , complaining that so many Triumphs were to be performed, without his restitution to his Crowns; reflecting withal, that the dishonour, though not the loss, rested meerly upon their persons, whose promises have been, not onely to see justice established in every place by their power, but himself righted, if not revenged against his Fathers enemies. As these inflamations a little discomposed the intended ceremonies, so was there presently a choice Councel assembled of both Nations, to consider of those differences, that appeared to thwart both the Monarchs former protestations: 'Tis true, that shame, compassion, and religion, seemed to contend with policy, quiet, and security in many disputes, wherein Arethusius himself became a most powerful advocate; though his Blood and Worth spoke more for his Cause, then either his own tongue or his friends solicitation; scorning to be suppliant for a possession to be procur'd him, of what other Princes should have freely offered; since it was but a benefice to their peculiar honour, which they could not but ambitiously desire, however too much sensuality for the present, had quenched the flames of so worthy a passion; but at last the fair and lovely Hesperiana , the chief object of the general peace, having left her vow of Religion, to comply in the greater service of the Gods, with a certain kinde of burning blush in her fair cheeks, and a few Christal tears in her beauteous eyes, entred the room where the whole company remained; when presently casting her self in a modest posture upon the ground, she uttered this language. The Heavens, said she, can bear me witness, I had not left the service of Holy Isis , but to redeem the almost ruined world, Religion being the motive, and Justice the obligation; wherefore if my expectation shall be deceived, although my quality may bear the title of great Queen of Syria , yet my inward thoughts must still be accompanied with nothing but discontents; since I shall esteem my marriage rather a sacriledge in opinion, then a happiness of reality; when besides the resolution I have made to the Gods to advance their honour: The Arch-Flamin of Delphos shall be deceived, in having granted any Dispensation, in that an assured hope to convert Nations, and settle Rights, were alwayes used as the pretentions: If Kings ought to be the distributers on earth of these blessings, let it be their endeavours to assist Arethusius , and give encouragement to instruct his people; in which prosecution, as Hesperiana shall ever glory, so without that attempt your own dignities must suffer. With these words her lovely cheeks being dyed again in Crimson blushes, as if her gentle temper, had been too much overcome by a religious passion, she finished her discourse in this manner; but had not time enough to receive an answer, before Queen Andromida her self entred the place, putting on a more majestick discontent. Can it be thought, said she, that the youthful and brave Prince Arethusius , (whose vertues have conquered his misfortunes, more abundantly by the heavens influence, then the tyranny and usurpation of his enemies, have overcome the hearts and properties of his unnatural people, by placing Hercrombrotus in his Throne) should stand so long a space demanding assistance of the two mighty Monarchs of the world, without any fruit or redress? Is it possible the Syrian and Egyptian blood should be so much adulterated, as not to inflame with indignation, rather then moderately apprehend his received injuries? especially when the miracles in his own person hath been performed, and the condition of those adversaries might tell you, that onely blinde fate made them opposers of so much worth and goodness? No, 'tis your Royalty and not his Interest, that suffers by the omission; since fame already hath sounded so loud a trumpet in his commendation, by the acquisitions of his noble soul, that all the blame henceforward must rest upon your not performance, as an ignominy to our dignities for ever: But to you, O you Gods, we may ask pardon for all those disgraces, though I must attribute my own former neglects to those Councels, which made me believe the Lydian factions, without trouble, would either end the differences or prepare a conquest; by this means I strived alwayes, to quiet the thoughts and importunities of Hyacinthia , whose indulgency to my particular, made her rest contented, until by this happy conjunction of the general Peace, my own obligations again have called me out to these expressions before two powerful Kings, whose interest I hope will satisfie me or themselves. This being delivered by the exasperate Queen, for the seeming delay was used towards Arethusius satisfaction, put on, either by her own noble compassion, or fortified with those promises she had formerly made to Hyacinthia , gave occasion to her Nephew Osiris to assure her, that if the people of Lydia's Dominions, did not suddenly give way in all obedience to his just rights, he would assist him, not onely with power but expedition, hoping the Syrian State would do the like; wherefore presently a determination was taken, to send proposals to the Senate of the Kingdom, then sitting in the great City of Sardis , which quickly removed again Prince Arethusius, towards the Countrey of Pamphylia , being a place thought more proper for any communication. No sooner was Prince Arethusius arrived within the Territories of the fruitful Countrey of Pamphylia , but the Nobility were assembled by the Egyptian Governour to give him entertainment; with the Palace of his great Lord and Master, prepared for the better accommodation of his now Royal Court, since his followers appeared more numerous then formerly; when as people of all parts being taken with hopes, as well as thoughts of his prosperity, began to think the two Kings had absolutely consented to his establishment, which caused daily arguments of several natures; some said it would be derogative from his honour, to admit of any expostulations with his Subjects, whose duty 'twas rather to obey his rights, then to condition for their own safeties, seeing their disaffections onely had caused his displeasure: Others again of the contrary alledged, that oblivions quieted mindes, and expressed magnanimity; the one procuring security to a Prince in his Dominion, the other contracted a veneration in peoples thoughts, to his person, which coupled love and obedience together; whereas any seeming intentions of revenge, would be thought, but some species of tyranny, that might be cunningly covered over, either with language or application, until the fittest opportunity for execution, when as time had now almost worn out the remembrance of offences, most of the chief actors being dead; so that it would not be safe to revive the horrour of them by new repetitions, but rather bury their blackness in silence, under the pretence of mercy and settlement, seeing the Nation was not in a condition, neither to undergo a Civil War nor to make any satisfaction. After these intimations quickly followed the Nuptials of the fair Princess Hesperiana , with our most glorious King Orontes , in which ceremony the tears of her Father were mixed abundantly with the preparation, since he knew shortly his Daughter was to be carried, both from his sight and Government: 'Tis true that many circumstances were used before this unwilling separation, but to avoid all tediousness of relations, I shall onely let you know (according as my self have been informed) a true description of those magnificent entertainments that the Royal pair received in the great City of Damascus upon their first entrance; for that no age was ever esteemed to have performed such wonders, accompanied with all the riches and splendour could be imagined, wherein beauty seemed to contend with bravery, which should more adorn the inferiour world, by an Esclat not again to be imitated but in the highest heavens. Some time before the appointed season, I say, Orontes with his admirable Bride, after their arrival in the Syrian Dominion, retired to a Castle a few furlongs from the great Town of Damascus , where they remained, until notice was given to all sorts of conditions in the Kingdom, that the preparation needful for this brave solemnity, was ready towards the execution; so that at the day appointed, (the streets being hung with exquisite tapestry, and the windows furnished by excellent beauties, since none other in houses, were suffered to prophane the shew, although the common people in heaps below called to the Gods for the prosperity of their King) the Heraulds first marshalled the Gentlemen in ranks, whose number exceeded the stones upon the ground, as their lustre did the stars in the firmament, all simpathyzing in one minde of concurrency; however their inventions of apparel, out-went nature her self in varieties: The horses they rode upon, seemed to be chosen one by one from the best races of the earth, differing exactly both in shape and colour, as if their ambition had taught them to be known for distinction, and there met onely to try the mastery in their Countreys fertility, as well, in what belonged to their courages as their handsomness; nevertheless the many spots curiously dapling their fair bodies rather appeared the art and care of choicest painters, then any way the work of chance or confusion, whilst in the interim, their manes on either side their necks, tied up in several knots by silver'd Ribbands, perfumed the very pavement where the Queen Hesperiana was to pass; as it were performing a kinde of rude homage to her Royalty; if not more commodiously to gather up the dainty flowers, that had been strewed all the way by the young Virgins of the Countrey, mixing those comely decorums, now and then with graceful corvets, as their skilful riders gave them the occasion, themselves being adorned with large Plumes, that played in the winde, not onely as it might be thought designed on purpose to refresh the air, but to delight the spectators; since the Suns brightness did more illustrate their youthful bravery, without much prejudice to their gallant comportments, the dust having been allay'd in the morning, by a gentle and propitious showre of rain; as if the couds had wholly conspired in the intention: These companies were divided into six Troops, if not rather Regiments, each being commanded by a Prince of the blood, whose Arms declared his descent and greatness, as the imbroideries of his liveries his riches and invention; wherein all seemed to out-doe one another in intention, though none but went beyond every imitation; as though the worlds wealth had been gathered together in one place, to be onely spent for Syria's honour, having beggered in the mean time other Nations in their productions, whereby the better to comply with the present Triumphs. The first Captain that appeared to march was clothed in red, bearing in his hand a naked Sword ready drawn for slaughter, though his apparel and caparison were wrought all over with gold and precious stones, by which was figured the representation both of War and Destruction, however gloriously set forth to shew, that command in either imployment, pretended to a certain kinde of terrifying respect, whereby obedience might be more prompt and efficatious, whilst the trappings of his horse were formed into many Companies of ordinary foot Souldiers, graced by several Ensigns and Drums though in Kettle models, not well to be distinguished, but by those who approached at the nearest distance; after which train followed a great Chariot, filled with nothing but variety of Trophies, being drawn by three mighty Tygers, as it should seem onely tamed for that purpose, the whole entangling the beholders imaginations with divers fancies, concerning the fate of former contentions, now ended as they hoped in the best of peace and felicity, when a joyful marriage appeared, to be the happy period of each Nation. The second Commander had his habit all over, embroidered with Pearle upon the purest black Velvet, pretending to a kinde of mourning posture for what was past, though again became enlightned by that rich innocency figured in his apparel, as it were between hope and certainty, in regard of the present conjunction of the Noble pair, who seemed now to have joyned the worlds division, by a more then humane influence; nevertheless something lamenting notwithstanding past accidents by a little shadow of darkness to complain of the misfortune: Neither did the curious dressing of his Steed disown the intention, who being the colour of night, was covered with the resemblance of a plumed Swan, cut out in white Sattin, and heightned in needful places with purest silver Purle, plated in every interruption by most excellent workmanship: over his head was carried a large Ombrella, to defend that beauty from the Suns violence, himself being guarded by multitudes of Foot-men and Pages, richly clothed in his own colours, though the neatness of the fashion most of all pleased the eye: When all the company was past, two Elephants haled a stately Throne; upon which was placed a goodly Hearse with Curtains; wherein seemed to be buried for ever all occasions of future difference, so exprest by sundry Garlands and Motto's contrived to that purpose. The third Conductor was accommodated in yellow Sattin, wrought exquisitely all over with gold, here and there intermixt with stones resembling the same lustre, cut out into the form of shining stars; so skilfully placed in the workmanship, as if those lights appeared through refulgent clouds; which not onely gave a gallant grace to the person of the Prince, but strock the spectators into a certain kinde of amazed respect, concerning his inward worth, although his quality might have sufficiently satisfied their thoughts; he appearing in that posture some God drest in humane shape, whereby to deceive mortality upon earth; and the rather did it strive with the apprehensions of the multitude, for that he wore on his head a burnish'd Helmet, from whence proceeded little rayes of Gold set with divers sparkling Diamonds, which by the Suns reflection more confounded the beholders expectation, if not eyes, towards an awful reverence: As the numerousness of his foot followers, were all clade in the same livery and colours, so was his baggage brought up behinde in a most glorious Chariot, crowned with Emperial Garlands, being drawn by a couple of huge Lions fitted with golden traces, and wearing rich collars of the same matter about their necks, whilst their long curled manes, as well terrified as delighted the people, on either side the street gazing at the wonder; the invention, as I may say, pretending to glory and jurisdiction. The fourth Regiment was a light Blue, resembling the heavens in lustre and splendour, the youthful Captain being adorned in rich Arms inlaid with Pearle and Gold, enamel'd between by most curious workmanship, with flowers and other pretty creatures belonging to nature, that seemed by their lively expression, to walk and creep according as his person had occasion to move, by the necessary agitation of his brave and courageous horse, covered with a caparison imbroidered with small stars of Diamonds, shining between oriental clouds, figured so artificially, that the design appeared to be some celestial firmament, created on purpose for the honour of the day: The Chariots that brought up the rear, was composed all over with imbost carved materials, here and there set with compartiments containing Flower-de-luces, the proper Armories of the Kingdom of Syria , yet encompassed round about with Garlands of red and white Roses, whilst at the back was placed the Goddess Pallas in a fringed Mantle, covering a little her gilded Armour, and tied upon the left shoulder by an artificial knot, making in letters the names of the Royal and Beautiful couple. This glorious Engine of Triumph was drawn by six white horses gallantly plumed, with other most magnificent ornaments, both in riches and curiosity, in that manner passing by, to make way for other inventions belonging to the shew. The next appearance to the view, was a green Livery, interchanged here and there with the best Cloath of Tissue, the Commander himself carrying a small Spear in his hand, tufted on the top with Silk and Gold; and was also Crowned with a wreath of choicest flowers, under which his Amber hair in curious curles seemed to be most advantageously moved by the winde; that as his beauty appeared to exceed all others, so the rude multitude took him to be a second Cupid , which they could not chuse but express in loud acclamations, almost to the disorder of the procession: His Caparison and Trappings were wrought into the fashion of a natural Pyesage, insomuch as a little Countrey was in some sort figured to move into the air, as his Horse in gentle corvets was directed to perform his own duty, that often was exercised as he passed by to the content of the beholders: His Chariot for the most part was enamel'd, according to the decorum of his colours, designed to represent youth and marriage joyned together, in the happiest posture the world could afford; whilst at the back was elevated upon a Throne, the Statue of Venus and her Son; the one naked with golden wings, and she clothed in a Nymph-like attire; which was drawn through the streets by two great Dolphins, made artificially with a sea under them rolling, by the onely art of people concealed from mens sight. The sixth and last Troop represented innocent Virginity all in white cloth of silver, heightned over the ground with the richest purle, and so ordered into diversity of works of several natures, easily to be perceived by those, that approached at any thing a near distance: The Lords Habit and Caparison were for the most part of the same Livery, save the latter that was cut out into the form of a pure Phenix, covering the Crupper with her Tail, as the wings did the Sides, gently in that manner playing with the weather, as the Horse stirred too and fro, or advanced forward in action: His Chariot that came behinde all his attendants, was leasurely drawn by four white Oxen of an unmeasureable greatness, pickt out on purpose (as it should seem) for such a shew, though guided in their course, by a fair youth not exceeding in age fourteen, with a silver Whip in the one hand, as the Reins in the other, fastened to the Beasts guilded Horns, wearing upon his head a Garland of white Roses and Lillies; whilst on the back-side was to be seen a transparant Altar smoaking with purest Incense, continually supplied as there was occasion, by the endeavours of a young Priest ready there waiting for the purpose; about whose person, were many Boyes and Virgins, who seemed most seriously to attend the service; and to that effect, in sundry Hymns often praised the vertues and excellency of their new Lady and Queen Hesperiana , which ended also the design of the Souldiers Triumph. Whilst the people on all sides were wondering at these Rareties, the great Officers of the Kingdom appeared in their ancient Ornaments of Honour, differing onely from their ordinary manner of habits belonging to other Ceremonies, in the rich magnificency of their Jewels; some riding upon Elephants, others upon Dromidaries, besides a third sort managing brave Persian and Arabian Horses, with their Ensigns of command carried before them, by Pages and other inferiour Ministers of State; their Staffiers and multitude of attendants on foot, clade with as much expence as could be procured, or art could devise, exceeding in number, and not to be equalled in beauty, gave alwayes a careful attendance to observe punctually their Lords command, whereby no part of the Ceremony might be omitted, tending to the honour and dignity of their Kings: After these the chief Chancellour or Steward of the Empire, was born aloft in a moving Throne, covered all over with cloth of Gold, and sitting in a Chair of State behinde a large Table, whereon were placed the Seals and other instruments belonging more properly to his place, who appeared to be as great in his Masters favour, as in his necessary command; being carried on in this glorious Engine, with so much cunning and skill, by the contrivers of the excellent work, that nothing seemed to draw the Chariot in the streets, though some wheels underneath forced by scrues made the whole proceed: If I should here, said he, number his attendants with their bravery, I might not onely enter my self into a new labyrinth of discourse, but make you overmuch surfeit, by the tediousness of the relation; especially not having a tongue polisht enough to fall upon every particular, worthy the description of so great an excess in bravery: Onely I shall say he had four great Maces born before him, as the chief marks of his authority, with a guard of an hundred Souldiers after his Throne clade in most rich Liveries of Crimson Velvet. When he was past, there appeared fifty Pages on horseback, so neatly accoutred in every degree, that it was a question whether their bravery, or their handsomeness did most delight the eyes of the spectators; since as the one gave them an amazed reverence, so the other afforded a melting affection, the whole being composed equally, between Beauty and Gallantry; as also their flaxen hair playing with the winde under bright Helmets, as if Cupid and Mars had joyned together in a youthful design, to take the world with delight and admiration: These marching two by two, the mighty Favourite Mazarius after them, was carried in a Litter of fine Chrystal, studded with Gold, being born as it were in the air with flying Griffins, artificially so contrived by Grecian Artists, chosen out of the Countrey onely for that purpose; to which design the wealth and power of Asia seemed to contribute, since the late general Peace rendred the earth pleased with his actions, and so consequently was attended in love, by three hundred Staffiers, holding in their hands Partizans of Ebony, tipt with Gold, and partly Enamelled: After this followed an hundred Pages all to be seen in rich cloth of silver, daintily wrought over with the same Mettle, being the Queens proper Livery, who wore Garlands of flowers upon their heads, curiously interwoven with silk and other materials, which could best imitate nature, though by a more exact decorum, since the malignity of time could not alter their seeming flourishing condition to any prejudice, either by act or shew: No sooner were these past the view, but a mighty green Island with Trees, unto which were tyed twelve white Unicorns, whose gilded Horns seemed wreathed with the best Laurel, drew after them a clear Chrystal Rock, cut in several steps by degrees, whereon many young Virgins, bearing in their hands branches of Palms, as the truest emblems of pacification, whilst Boyes of the purest beauty both for complexion and making, bestriding the Beasts, became in all appearance, as well their directors as their ornament; whilst at the top in a golden Neeche, was placed the most excellent Hesperiana , cloathed in a vesture of admirable work, so rarely contrived without any perceiveable seam, that she seemed some heavenly Goddess, enlightned onely by refulgent Rayes, carrying fairly on her brows, a small Coronet of best Diamonds, from whence descended in curious Curles the rich Tresses of her Hair, whose value, as it is thought, hath now redeemed the world from its future oppression; love being the means, and that wonder the object: 'Tis true a watchet Mantle covered with Stars, as a necessary punctilio of Royalty, something obscured that glorious Lustre, by hanging over her comely shoulders, yet the long Train she wore being born up by many excellent beauties, did not onely conveniently ease her of the burthen, but added some grace to her own Majesty; so that after another hundred of Pages clade in the same manner (whilst the Syrian and Egyptian Nobility on both sides guarded the Throne) had brought up the Rear of this fair company, the great Ladies of the Kingdom according to their degrees, in other Chariots followed in order as the Heralds had directed, whose numbers might be here again in some sort specified, if either there needed an amplification of the Ceremonies by discourse, or that the descriptions of so many natures would not prove over burthensome; since the conclusion must rather be without end, then perfectly related by a better tongue then I can challenge to my self; however you may know further, that the Souldiers of the Kings Troops being most richly clade both in Arms and Habits, shut up the last march in these companies, which continued not onely all the night, but the next day following: But to be more short, when the young Queen came to the first gate of the City, she found a brave triumphant Arch prepared by the Governour for her entrance: The Fabrick was all of Theban Marble, supported by Dorick Pillars, over whose Cornish was a very large Compartiment, wherein were contained the Armories of Egypt and Syria , over the which was lively represented the statue of Fame sounding a Trumpet, who seemed at present to be crowning by sundry Cupids in Clouds, whilst under his feet in a Scroll was written this expression.  Beauty overcoming War, it self becomes most famous. Hesperiana soon passing under the building, was suddenly overtaken by a gentle showre of seed Pearle, which lightly falling upon her Robes, from thence tumbling to the ground, covered the small Island of her support all over in the nature of hail, though not to the loss, but the benefit of the common people: This manner of magnificence the gallant Commander bestowed upon her first entertainment. In the Market-place of the Town was another Trophey of honour raised to her reception: the materials were of Porphire, with sundry coloured stones of considerable value, framed into double Ionian collumes, and architrave Freeze and Conish, wreathed and adorned by Laurel Branches: On the higher part was a huge Globe, setting forth the large extent of the Syrian Empire, being encompassed about with a plentiful Cornu-copia, of the best productions nature could afford, whilst either side shewed the statues of Ceres and Bacchus , imprecating Jove for the continuance of his heavenly favours: The top of the building was wrought in the manner of a large Cupelo, covered with shining Copper in half circular Tiles, each corner bearing a fair Pyramid crowned with bowls of Gold, reaching almost to the extremity of the whole, however the middle served as convenient Bases or Pedestal, for a great Image of Peace, cast in Brass, to the wonder and amazement of the present company: This Triumphant monument, had three passages imbowed with curious workmanship, wherein were represented the several accidents of the War lately pacified, all tending to the glory of the Syrian Nation, until at last a certain Shrine opening with most admirable art, a rocky Land-skip of the Indies appeared, that contained a world of brave Treasure, figured as the Dower of the Princess Hesperiana , sent from her Father the great Monarch of Egypt , but yet not in price like her admired person; when by an inscription these words were signified by Capital Letters, over the head of the highest Arch.  Her Vertue is our best Riches, As her Beauty King Orontes Pride. No sooner was the Queen past through the greatest Gate of Honour, belonging to that gallant edifice, but at the foot of her Throne, was presented by kneeling Citizens in silver Baskets, divers rare Jewels of all values and lustre, could be got either for price or favour, over the whole Continent of Asia ; which she accepting with a beauteous smile, wherein both love and majesty seemed a little to contend for mastery, the whole Triumph again proceeded towards the period of their desires at the Temple, where the King was attending upon a Throne to meet his Queen in full consummation of his long intended joy. Not long after their departure, the third and last Arch appeared, raised at the excessive expence of all the Lawyers of the Kingdom, it being built onely with one passage two stories high, though flat on the top, covered with excellent Rail and Ballaster cast in Corinthian Brass, and brought from Greece to this purpose: The Faccato was composed of double collumes having Neeches between, wherein were placed brave Statues of white Marble, representing the former Heroes of the world, that first taught learning to the rude multitude, giving them rules to obey civilly: Upon the very top was seated on a huge pedestal, the Image of Epyre crowned, holding in one hand a naked Sword, and in the other a Book open, whilst Justice was standing by her side, bearing a pair of Ballance, with Death and Execution turning their backs, under whose feet was written this signification in Capital Letters of Gold.  Conquest bringing Peace may procure Mercy; Yet must not destroy Justice when there is occasion. As the Queen passed through this portal in her Crital seat, the roof suddenly was seen to open of it self, from whence was perceived to issue in certain oriental Clouds, divers beautiful Ganimeds holding amongst them a small Emperial Crown, which being gently placed upon her head, they returned singing with delicate voices, to the airs of concealed instruments, for that purpose hid within the body of that excellent building. But now approaching the Instant for the meeting of the two Royal Lovers, after the precedent company of this glorious procession ( Condorosus being chief in quality) had done their wonted homage to the King, seated upon a Throne of Ivory, and guarded on either side with golden Lions, not far distant from the Gate of the great Temple, Orontes afar off beholding the object of his delight, of a sudden descended from his Chair, to give his heart more satisfaction; whereupon she noting the ready posture of her youthful Lord, as quickly prepared her thoughts (by the service of those Nymphs in her Train) to meet with his wishes, and so consequently arising from her Chair, was conducted by her Ladies to the foot of that Rock supported by the green Island, where the Kings hasty love soon met her in the way with something a violent passion: When he had sealed the best part of his intentions by many kisses upon her fair lips (remaining so as it were in an extasie for something a long space) he gently taking her by the hand, led her towards the stately Fane of Venus , where the consummation of his joy as well as her hopes were to be performed; until at last being met by the high Bishop of the place, wearing his golden Mytre on his head, they were both presently conducted to the great Altar of Hymen , where they continued praying until the accomplishment of all needful ceremonies belonging to their perpetual conjunction could be performed: from whence all being finished, they went with joy enough to the Kings own Palace; however in the way they were a little interrupted by the sudden appearance of a hundred Camels richly adorned both with Silk and Gold, that had been sent by the mighty King of Egypt , after his Daughter with her proper Dower, being promised in marriage upon the conclusion of that happy unity: Thus, I may say, ended this most glorious and magnificent Triumph, being the worlds wonder, and Syria's splendour; wherein if my weak tongue hath been too penurious in the relation, I must not onely beg your pardon, but ask my Countrey forgiveness; however my discourse may serve I hope for your divertisement, and with these words presently rose from his seat, whereby to give Parismenus a liberty of departure. Parismenus being in this manner discharged from the Ambassadours company, going homeward toward his own lodging, began to consider more deeply, as well what had been delivered by the wise Minister of State, concerning the greatness and magnificence of the Syrian Empire, as of the condition and the uncertainty of Prince Arethusius affairs, notwithstanding Hermelaus proceedings had given more then thoughts of his speedy establishment: yet as of one side he found the people of Lydia weary of so many changes; so of the other, he doubted very much Mazarius , if he did not prevail in the intended match for his Neece, that he would obstruct all he could Arethusius reception to the Crown; which easily he might do, by joyning his power with Abactanus interest, who now was escaped from prison, with the rest of the discontented party, that perhaps out-numbred the Souldiers belonging to the Generals command; which put Parismenus into many thoughts, and withal to consider, whether he should presently take a journey towards the Countreys and Dominions of Pamphylia , or rest satisfied until the meeting of the next Senate, who were to determine, as 'twas said, not onely the Title of the succession to the Government, but all other differences appertaining to the late troubles: But whilst for many dayes he remained wavering and inconstant in his determinations (some time believing without the Syrian Favourites friendship, Arethusius could not be King; and other whiles hoping, his own Subjects in despight of all opposition, would willingly return to their old obedience) news came to the City of Sardis , that Abactanus was again taken, being made a prisoner, to the more joy then wonder of the common people, who for the most part love punishment and hate pacification, in persons of eminent qualities; however this intelligence quickly converted the minde of troubled Parismenus to something a better temper, and by consequence made him rest satisfied, until the time of the assembling the new Councel, before he moved in any desires of mighty Mazarius , upon whose actions the eyes of the whole Nation in a manner were fixed, as if directed by some powerful Oracle to decide, not onely the controversies of War and peace, but the happiness of a convenient (if not a rightful) succession in Government, since people scarce believed the old constitution could ever be renewed, after so long a time of interruption; especially when so many interests were to be satisfied, that feared as well to be divested of those riches they had got from other mens Estates, as to become severely chastized for those horrid murthers they had committed, without fear or resentment, seeing the most part of the Army were still wavering in their obedience to Hermelaus their new General; besides, the insolent and lasting command they desired to hold over all sorts of conditions, which they had not yet lost, if their Officers had not been too ambitiously covetous, or themselves confounded by perswasion, in regard it was esteemed the rashest act of Treason could be imagined, but to name Arethusius King in any Assembly, notwithstanding the Tyrant Hercrombrotus , had usurped the Authority though not the Title, with all the cruelty and dissimulation could be acted upon the earth, to the disadvantage and oppression of the whole Nation; yet nevertheless became flattered if not envited to the Government, by those who either thought to gain by his power, or were terrified in his Jurisdiction, not minding the Gods Worship, or reflecting upon their own baseness. Not many weeks of expectation, as I say, brought together this great Senate, in that very place where King Euarchus fate had been determined, by the wicked practices of perjured Hercrombrotus ; who was a person that most delighted in blood, if not smiled alwayes in revenge, not content a glory so eminent should shine in Lydia's Horizon, when his own want of birth and vertue, could pretend to nothing but wicked envy, and a strict compact with hell, whereby the better to compass his presumptuous ambition, by an example never before practised by horrid Treason: But the Senate being met, they presently fell upon expostulations, whether the old Government should stand for ever, or Kingly Jurisdiction should again be reassumed; many believing the people would never be perswaded, to admit of Arethusius Establishment, without some conditions made first for their advantage; especially when so many opinions were on foot, concerning the true Worship of the Gods, and the Souldiers had the power of the whole Kingdom in their hands, who could not be disbanded until their full wages were duly satisfied, being a work as they thought, most stupendious to be performed, out of the impoverished Nations necessities: Others again were of a minde, that the suns brightness appearing in the Kings countenance, accompanied by Right and Honour, would quickly disperse all the clouds of disaffection and rebellion; especially when aided by the violent love and fidelity of the brave Subjects of his own party and Interest: But whilst almost nights and days were spent in these several disputes, despairing vapours often obscuring their greatest hopes towards any settlement, since men were doubtful in their fears, and constant in their gains, of a sudden they were saluted from Prince Arethusius with this Declaration; That in regard the people might be confident of their own affection, and secured in his forgiveness, he promised all manner of persons within his Dominions, not only a free and general pardon from their crimes, but a future place in his opinion, if their actions should any way correspond with his intentions, onely as he said, those Villains who had appeared instrumental in his Fathers Murther, were to expect dire punishment, as well from himself as from the Gods. As these Majestick Letters were received with satisfaction enough from most of the Assembly, so many over guilty of their own proceedings; or at leastwise knowing their inward hearts, were not right to his particular, notwithstanding the graces he offered to all men, having perhaps perchance purchased Lands and Honours which they were unwilling to leave, began sundry violent contentions, against the determinations of receiving a King, without some conditions that might restrain his power, if the people hereafter should be in any kinde vexed by his Government; however they did acknowledge that the proposition was altogether against the rules and nature of Lydia's constitution: 'Tis true, this debate took up much time in dispute, until at last, either wearied out with the uncertainty of their many violent contentions, or rather fearing the late unity of Forreign Monarchs in the general peace, would quickly by their assistance compel a more slavish obedience, then was any way desired by their own gentle and most merciful Prince, whose goodness almost out-went the vertues of the whole earth, at last concluded in a seeming joy, to proclaim him King with all expedition, to the infinite joy of all the common people: No sooner were these Ceremonies performed, with most stately and accustomed magnificency, but some of the chief Nobility were appointed to attend his Majesty in the Island of Cyprus , whither he was newly removed out of the Territories of Pamphilia , whereby with more conveniency to have the conversation of his sweet Sister the Princess Cloria , whose entire love and constant affection, had been a long time his principal delight, if not abundant satisfaction, when despairing thoughts most afflicted his followers, although his own noble courage and supernatural activity, rendred him still confident in his fate, as well as the world in his worth: These Messengers being landed at Salamine , the Countrey quickly provided them transportation to the great City of Paphos , where they found their young King (when admitted to his presence) clothed in black garments, having in a manner used no other since his Fathers death, as well to let people know that pious duty which belonged to his condition, as to remember his particular Subjects of the justice, that appertained to the Gods satisfaction: A long while he beheld them with an eye of severest Majesty, until at last by little and little he cleared his frowning brow, and in the end spoke to the company after this manner. I am glad, said he, to see this change, yet I could have wisht there had been never any alteration; not onely for my loss, but your reputations; since other Nations then had been more terrified, and you better secured; for that opinion of fidelity and courage conserves friends, and deterrs enemies in those attempts, that covetousness and ambition often procures to a Countreys hazzard: But I know it is the Heavens property to forgive, however alwayes with these restrictions of future amendments, and constant perseverance, both which I shall not doubt, being your countenances pretend to the one, as your words have declared the other: 'Tis true, I might speak more like a King amongst you, both in blood and slaughters, when my Sword was ready unsheathed (by the provocation of other Princes) to have taken a revenge answerable to the faults of the multitude; but before the execution could be prosecuted, some propitious God seemed to hold my hand, as pleading mercy for the peoples benefit, being an Attribute most noble of all Olimpus power; and we resembling such Deities, cannot a little but wave the decorums of the severest justice, rather then condemn the innocent within the crowd of those horrid Traytors, who have perpetrated such wickedness, as almost obscures the sun from shining in Lydia's Horizon; and can never expect a day of light, until the soul of great and vertuous Euarchus be pacified, by sacrifices of punishments, or expiations, in some sort answerable to his goodness; and others crimes; however be you rather the instruments of these condemnations, then my Royalty the appearing actor in the deserved Tragedy, whereby the better to allay every malignant tongue, as the more to gain your selves honour; since the Nations repentance will be seen by those laws you shall make to this purpose, as monuments to posterity of your intended obedience, which must needs quiet my thoughts, and take off Lydia's scandall that for many years hath buried all its glory: With these words he presently quit the room, onely with some few tears in his eyes, as a greater testimony of his inward sorrow, considering the sad remembrance of his Fathers death. Many dayes after this had not passed in goodly triumphs for the Kings entertainment, before there came news from the City of Salamine , concerning the arrival of a gallant Fleet, whereby with more state to transport his youthful person, into the Kingdom of Lydia his own proper Dominions; for that the peoples rage and excessive joy, could not be satisfied any longer time without his wished presence, putting on a general face of obedience both to his right and his commands; as if hitherunto they had lived without a soul, and breathed in an ayre suffocated with pestilent vapours, which had destroyed productions in every kinde, either in profit or subsistance; therefore sent him their cryes with their Ships, to fetch him towards their relief; promising for ever, not onely their best affections, but their ready services, in punishing those horrid Traytors, who had as well obstructed their Liberties, as hindred his Rights, by an ominous resistance, proceeding from the infernal Furies; however permitted by the heavens justice for those many crimes committed throughout the whole Nation: 'Tis true, Arethusius gentle disposition, being as apt to forgive as inclinable to be satisfied, with these outward expressions of love and duty; especially when he considered his Countreys fate, if a perfect agreement were not presently made, since other Princes of Asia stood ready prepared, to revenge their own injuries, as well as assist his titles, became altogether perswaded by these demonstrations; rather casting himself into the armes of his Countreys love, then to dispute former differences towards their hurt; until some of his wisest Councellours fearing his precipitation, desired his goodness, that although he intended to shew nothing but mercy to his people, yet providence required some expostulation with the now sitting Senate, as well to be provided of money for his necessary expences, since his train wanted those commodities, as to be secured from his Fathers fatal and deadly enemies; since he could not be but suspicious of the intentions of many, who yet seemed not to delight in the resolutions of his Subjects, to have a new crowned King amongst them: The Princess Cloria sitting by her youthful Brother (being as it were no more then a passive companion of these disputes) of a sudden became inflamed, with the apprehension of his future danger, however rather arising from the many words were uttered, then the reasons could be given for their fears, Lydia now appearing totally converted to a new obedience; wherefore told them presently, with some tears in her beautiful eyes, that although she doubted not but Arethusius Majestick presence, would terrifie his enemies, as well as confirm his friends to an entire duty; yet was she ready her self to engage her whole Dower within the fruitful Island of Cyprus , whereby the better to contribute to the expence; withall durst undertake, to procure an Army if need were to guard his person, as well within as without his Kingdom, towards his safety in that honourable journey, that pretended more to the Subjects Liberty, then to the Kings Glory: Prince Arethusius being transported with his Sisters expressions, after he had by two or three loving kisses imprinted his thanks upon her fair lips, assured them all there present, that as he was resolved to entertain his peoples affections with any hazzard, since he hoped the immortal Gods would be his strong defence, as well for Lydia's Interest as his own Titles; so was he well perswaded, that both the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation, stood ready prepared with their lives to oppose any rebellion, or desperation whatsoever in his behalf; who desired not to reign at all, but onely in their loves and assistance: Besides, as he said, he not alone expected, but trusted to the fidelity of the General Hermelaus , whose constant courage had first rouled the great stone, that had broke down the huge Mountain of Tyranny and Usurpation, towards the advancement of his interest; wherefore could not be himself any impediment to his future prosperity, lest he might fall under the worlds censure, either by sloth or neglect: But scarce had the King delivered these words, ere Prince Ascanius entred the room, bearing in his hand a paper, signed by all the rich Merchants of the wealthy City of Sardis , whereby they humbly presented his Royal Brother with a thousand Talents of Gold, as a just ransom, belonging to those faults they had committed, for so many years together, in refusing or not accepting his Government, when wicked Hercrombrotus kept them in slavery, which they desired now to redeem by his goodness: Arethusius standing a pretty space in a certain kinde of muse, at last with a smiling countenance, snatching the writing out of Ascanius possession, uttered this language, though he fixed his looks in the interim towards the heavens: You Gods, you Gods, said he, how just and unalterable are all your decrees, if frail man had but the patience to wait your pleasures, attending the end of your infinite mercies; nevertheless Princes must be like them in those properties, forgiving rather in love, then alwayes to punish with severity; especially when hopes are remaining of entire amendment, which I shall never doubt, as long as Arethusius means to be temperate in governing the Nation; witness these protestations my dear Sister Cloria , with the rest of this faithful company. These publick Declarations of the Kings noble resolutions, not onely settled the mindes of the imployed Lords, sent by the Senate of Lydia to know what their submission would produce, but gave full intimation to the whole Island of Cyprus , that shortly they should be deprived of the best glory of the world, although their own covetous mis-interpretations, had formerly banished his Royal Person, out of their wealthy and populous Dominions, for no other reason, but to free themselves, from the fears and oppressions of Hercrombrotus Forces; valuing Commodity before Honour, and Riches beyond Justice; which quickly wrought these effects upon Cloria's nature and affection: That since she had been hitherunto a willing partner in all her Brothers injuries, she could do no less then accompany him in his future satisfactions: To which purpose, within a few dayes, she assembled together the principal Majestrates of the several Provinces; where being met together in a great Hall, with a kinde of a sweet modesty accompanied by a clear expression, she delivered her thoughts to them in this manner: My Lords, said she, if the adverse fortunes of King Arethusius , had still frowned upon his condition, perhaps Cloria's presence had been longer troublesome to your Nation; since I know not how to judge of your affections, when necessity rather then love hath been our entertainments, ever since the death of brave Narcissus, whose worth was your glory, as his Fathers valour the whole Countreys benefit: but seeing the Gods have once again favoured our prosperities, the native place of our being must first share of our Triumphs; from thence I came a Kings Daughter to your shores, and here have brought an heir for your Government; although contested by unequal births, who should have dominion over his person, however the right of nature gave my self the chief prerogative, both in his years and blood; which certainly would have broke a Mothers heart, if my patience and courage had not gone beyond your unkindnesses; but in regard the earth puts on a general face of forgiveness, charity and honour invites me to joyn in the Jubile; and that you may see I intend not to wave your friendship and correspondency, though your respects have scarce deserved the favour, as I shall endeavour to reconcile my Brother with your Island, so will I leave my young Son to your protection, until his riper age make him capable of his Fathers imployment; hoping such a vertue can never be forgot in your memory, lest the heavens punish your ingratitude, as the world will hate your pride; both joyning together to render you the example of a miserable people, by taking that jurisdiction from your power, you have continued by the wisdom and magnanimity of your former Dukes; whose gallantry raised your condition from being, as you know, poor Fishermen to become great Merchants, not using to fight but under their countenance; and fighting had been destroyed, if their policy had not circumvented your enemies: which being said, she again rested silent, casting her lovely looks upon the ground, as if she were inwardly sorry for having delivered so much of her thoughts in publick: But the hearers, whether convinced in their own guilt, or overcome by Cloria's kindness, with many tears in their eyes not onely expressed their abundant grief, but with loud acclamations devulged, they would have no other Prince but young Narcissus , who truly inherited his Fathers Right, as his Mothers Blood, both agreeing in his towardly age, to make him the Captain of their Forces, as the defender of the peoples Liberties; undertaking withal to see him educated, according to his own dignity, and his friends content; whereby they hoped to render him a person, worthy of the worlds admiration, as fit for the heavens fruition; beseeching such a perpetual correspondency with the Lydian Nation, that might make the King confident of their service, in his Countreys benefit, since trade was their vocation, and pains their onely riches, which hitherunto had stiled them fortunate, as past ages knew their victories: This being said, they parted from the room, with such a humility, as belonged to that presence they were before. 'Tis true, though the Princess Cloria rested satisfied with these expressions, nevertheless King Arethusius was unwilling to make any longer stay in their Countrey, since he found his own Subjects were violent in their expectation, as his private thoughts not passive enough for the least obstruction; wherefore caused present Proclamation to be made amongst his own followers concerning the time of his departure, from the fair City of Paphos , towards the much greater Town of Salamine , where his gallant Fleet yet remained, to carry him with a prosperous winde to the Lydian Coasts, upon whose shores he was informed, his honest General Hermelaus , attended with the whole Army to wait his pleasure; so that all Cyprus addicted themselves to Triumphs, as he passed by the several Territories belonging to the Countrey, whilst Altars smoaked in every place with the best perfumes, to demonstrate his welcome as their own affections; the Boors being drest in antick habits, with rural delights to entertain his view, whilst comely Virgins strewed all the paths with Flowers, as himself and Sister past through the Towns, whilst stately Caval-cades, accompanied by the chiefest Majestrates, met him many furlongs from their dwellings, to shew a loving duty to his person, as at night invited all his attendants to their repose, where feasts of excessive cost were ready drest for their accommodation; the Military Discipline being in the streets under curious Banners, both to guard and satisfie his content, when the keys of every gate in the interim were delivered into the possession of his own Officers, that dispersed their command among the Souldiers, as if their natural allegiance belonged onely to King Arethusius , as an appearing conquerour of all mens affections: and the rather might it be so interpreted, seeing the Nobility in costly Troops prest on every side to do him Homage, as if some new Prince had been created by the Gods, in a miraculous manner to bear rule over the people, for a more perfect happiness then as yet they enjoyed in former times, though alwayes governed by the wisdom and courage of the Narcissian Family; neither were the Priests and Lawyers wanting every where in their Orations, to congratulate the Kings happy return, and with these several expressions brought him to the famous Haven of Salamine . But Arethusius however he was sufficiently pleased at their gallant demonstrations of joy, wherefore seemed courteously to comply with their intentions, yet in his countenance might be perceived, a certain kinde of disdainful aspect, both in regard of his own former usage, as for their want of care in his Sisters particular; notwithstanding he determined totally to dissemble his passions, either until he was better settled in his Kingdom, or they had procured from him a milder opinion: Upon his arrival in the Town, he went to the great Mole in the Sea, from thence to behold the triumphs of his well ordered Fleet, that was sent to transport his person into the Kingdom of Lydia ; so that after he was placed on a Throne with his fair Sister on his right hand, twelve goodly Ships were perceived gently sailing by in yellow and red liveries, with all their Streamers and Banners displayed in so becoming a posture, as if the water and they together had strived, which should best grace one another; since the calmness of one side of the weather, and the propitiousness of the windes of the other, seemed to concurr in a design of highest perfection; neither long was it before they were followed by as many brave Gallies, each having its Captain upon the uppermost Deck, so gorgeously apparelled in every particular, as they all seemed either the Sons of Neptune , or some other Sea-God most ruling amongst the Waves; whilst in the midst one taller then the rest (as if guarded by their intention) was to be seen, so extraordinary for beauty, and over rich in workmanship, that it appeared onely fit to transport the sole Monarch of the Ocean, to take possession of all the admirable rarities within the Indian World: however when they came over against the Kings seat, as if some supernatural obedience was to be done to that Majesty, they every one together let down their top Flag, and presently after sent from their inclosed bosomes, most rare and delicate musick, accompanied at every period with the sound of such Trumpets, as no where else but in Lydia were to be found: These being past and proceeding in their course, by the strength of Oars in the hands of lustiest Gally-slaves, all clade in red and yellow Sattin; the last Squadron instantly brought up the rear, wherein the Admiral himself commanded, with a Plume of Feathers hanging at his back, as also bearing a Truncheon (the proper Ensign of his Office) upon his thigh; when coming near the Prince, presently command was given to slacken all the Sails, which being performed with haste and dexterity, boards were laid to convey the General to Land, until arriving at a small distance from the King, they fell instantly on their knees, humbly begging his mercy, and promising their own fidelity; since as they said, both heaven and earth had deceived them in their expectation. Prince Arethusius being a little surprized at this kinde of submission, stood some time in a muse, fixing his looks stedfastly upon his person, without returning any answer at all; as if he intended by his judgement to distinguish, between his inward fidelity and outward profession, until at last as it were absolutely convinced in his thoughts, he bid him rise from the ground, with this assurance, that he had not onely obtained a pardon, but should enjoy a grace, as well to shew a Kings magnificence, as become an example to other people; and withal in that very place, bestowed upon him his own most noble order of Knighthood, which he wisht him to wear, as a testimony of his Princes goodness, and the Subjects liberty, not drawing his Sword in time to come but in those quarrels. These actions being performed, with many other ceremonies belonging to the season; the King having constituted his Brother Ascanius Great Admiral of the Lydian Dominions, being accompanied by his fair Sister, took the Seas one morning when Aurora had drest the Heavens all over with blushing red, perhaps at the apprehension of so brave a Majesty, that was not to be entertained but by a bashfull countenance, lest presumption might appear to faulter in respect, and so encourage too careless a boldness amongst the common people, who were to adore in reverences, rather then welcome their Prince by ordinary acclamations; in which posture the whole Fleet sailed by the Asian shores, the Trees in the interim seeming to do homage to his right, by a certain kinde of natural inclination to the earth, procured either by the windes violence, or the waters vapours, ordered perhaps by some God for his Triumphs; which Triumphs continued in full prosperity, until his wisht for Countreys Cities shewed their heads, having their gilded tops above the Horizon of Lydia , however here and there intermixt with white Cliffs that formerly had given the Countrey another denomination, that at last brought them to Anchor before a Haven in the Province of Caria , though being almost night the King commanded not to land, until the chearful day might give better testimonies of his Reception, to that Continent where Rebellion had outed him of his Right: when the next day that Phoebus with his golden rayes (proud of such a guest) more early then ordinary, appeared in the East, gloriously to give him entertainment, the Pylots desired to know his pleasure: But scarce had Arethusius given order for his own landing, but he was advertized that Hermelaus the General, with the whole Army, was attending upon the Banks to wait his commands: which being known, he in person advanced towards the Sea with such a haste, as sufficiently demonstrated his affection to Royal Vertue; where the King received him in his armes with many imbracements; calling him not onely Friend to his Countrey, but Father to his particular concernments; whilst Hermelaus on his knee seemed to shed many tears of joy, at the onely apprehension of this happy reception by all his peoples affections: however the King being yet something passionate to know more of his own affairs, notwithstanding the publick applause of the Souldiers every where, confirmed sufficiently either his belief or his hopes, went again into his private Cabbin, leading the General by the hand, as a further testimony to the multitude, not onely of his person but his obligation; where he continued with him in secret conversation, until the Tyde was ready for his departure: the Tyde I call it (although the Mediteranian waters in those Coasts do neither ebb nor flow) because sometimes agitated by the windes at certain seasons, they seem to do so to the apprehension of people, which of a sudden made the King break off his discourse, giving other commands for his present transportation to Land; which being instantly effected by the violent industry of the Marriners, and those Slaves in the Galleys (some carrying planks, others almost filling up the Harbour with their naked bodies, the better to facilitate a passage for all his company:) As soon as he came to the shore, with a smiling look, he cast up his eyes to the Heavens, using these words also in expression. You Gods (said he) how great are your mercies, for not onely defending innocency by your goodness, but rendring Crowns in your justice to the true owners of them; when he that was forced to flie from his enemies in this very place, for the safety of his own person and life, should first be received here as glorious Monarch of the Lydian Empire; when as the Army conspiring in the same thought of joy, gave such a shout, as if the skies should have rent asunder with the noise, whereby to have made a breach for the Gods to behold the solemnity; and afterwards all drew out their Swords with one accord as a testimony to the world, they ever intended to maintain his Right, notwithstanding any Rebellion or Tyranny might again threaten their destructions, as in the times of wicked and perjur'd Hercrombrotus: Presently after this the King Horse being brought, whose colour was black, though graced with many stars of white over his body, mounting upon him with a dexterity, answerable to his youth and courage, the Princess Cloria being also placed in her Chariot: And thus in a certain kinde of confused order (by reason of the multitudes of his attendants) they all marched to the next Town prepared for his lodging, where notwithstanding he entred by Torch light; (for the day was not long enough to finish those congratulations) they presented every where to his acceptance delightful objects, although intermixt in many places, by most horrid spectacles of Traytors Heads and Limbs hung upon Trees, as the willing sacrifices of his people to his Right; which however oftentimes procured some few tears, proceeding from the compassionateness of his noble soul, that seemed to delight more in humane mercies then in justest punishments. But whilst the King rested some space in the first City, waiting the conveniency of preparation for his entry into the great Town of Sardis , in the interim entertaining such Ambassadours as were sent him from all other Princes, both to acknowledge and congratulate his Royalty, which the perverseness of his fortunes, would not formerly suffer them to perform; either wanting heroicalness enough in their natures for such decorums, or perhaps so designed by the heavens for the farther demonstration of his courage, or the better lustre to his future glory, of a sudden there appeared before his eyes Creses , that presented him, on his knee, with Letters from Queen Hyacinthia: 'Tis true, having understood of his joyful admission to the Crown, he had left Delphos with the news, and afterward visiting his vertuous Mother at Damascus , by her powerful directions was imployed presently by her in that service. The Kings passions (though surprized a little in the beginning) demanding no questions at all, till violently breaking up the seals, he found the Writing spoke this language.  If the Majesty of a King can comply with the Affections of a Mother, I shall have no cause to fear these Lines, will prove any interruption to your Glory; however by them I must let you know, that as Orontes and Andromida , seem to triumph abundantly in your Victories; so can this Messenger assure you, of those happy Omens, the Gods have provided towards your Government, if you contribute freely to their purposes, by admitting the Rites the World every where practiseth; however these Oracles are seldom divulged, but by those Authorities proceeding from the Powers, that have now placed you in your Royal Throne, and afforded you a miraculous Conquest over all your Enemies; Wherefore be mindful of the Heavens Blessings, as Hyacinthia shall be still of your Prosperity.  Arethusius after he had read this Letter (giving him also his hand to kiss) demanded presently how his Mother did? and whether or no she had as yet in any measure, digested the sad occasions of her former grief? Truly Sir, replyed Creses , as the highest passions for the most part are allayed, either by time or perswasion, so may she have in some sort mittigated the rigour of her discontents; however she appears still in all companies, a perfect Image of sorrow: The King upon this with some tears dropping from his eyes, after he had conferred the Honour of his principal Order on Creses , as a greater testimony of his welcome, retired instantly into his Chamber; where being alone in some obscurity, he reflected upon these considerations: First he considered the excessive loss the Queen had received, by the untimely and violent death of his Father, whose love to her was almost beyond nature; whereby with him not onely all her comfort and honour was lost in the world, but being banished from her Countrey which the fates had given her in marriage, all the means of subsistance that conditions had contracted towards her Dower, though meriting the fortunes of a Kings Daughter, had for many years together been obstructed: so that with these thoughts he resolved to invite her into Lydia , to take such share of his happiness, as a Sons duty was able to bestow; wherefore suddenly calling for Parismenus , that was come also from Sardis to wait upon his prosperity, he communicated to him his intentions, who in obedience to those commands, the next morning parted from the Court, to begin a new journey towards the Kingdome of Syria . When the King had rested sufficiently in those Territories of Caria , the preparations for his glorious entry being now ready, a command was given by his Officers to have all his Train put into their best postures, against the appointed time of parting, the Army having marched the day before; wherefore being attended with many brave Ambassadours of several Nations (amongst which number was his Cousin Thyasmus , newly sent from the potent King of Armenia , whose strange adventures since his departure out of the Dominions of Lydia , are notwithstanding too long to intermix with these solemnities) set forward towards this more joyful then triumphant journey; for that the interiour hearts of his people spoke rather his content, then the glittering gallantry of those that met him in the Shew; although whole Countreys from every part of his jurisdiction, not onely came bravely mounted, but esteemed it a sin not pardonable by the Gods, if they had not been personally present at his arrival; since such as staid behinde, if unavoidable necessity had not pleaded their excuse, must like Traytors have been torn in pieces by the multitude at their return. In this posture I may say, the King made his glorious progress, towards the great Seat of his large Empire, that became less splendid it self, in being so emptied of that numerous company of Nobility, that followed his Train; onely Souldiers guarded the streets, as Ladies filled the windows; which however were so richly hung with the best stuff could be procured, as if all the Deities of Heaven had been there to be received, for the Earths honour and the Gods satisfaction: but when he came within some few Furlongs of the City, the chief Magistrate accompanied by five hundred of the wealthiest Towns-men met him, clothed all in brave Grecial Coats; as also wearing about their necks Silken Halters, in token both of their guilt and repentance; which the King perceiving, smilingly told his followers, That as he could not but blame these people for their folly, so must he needs pitty their want of understanding, seeing his Fathers mildness might have been their protection; however he meant now his own Grace should be their fortune. Proceeding on forward, at last he might behold a huge pyle of Wood, raised in the nature of a Pyramid; where on the top was to be seen, a man tyed naked, with many strong Iron Chains; notwithstanding others were also in lower degrees bound, although in the same posture of appearing punishment: he seeming curious enough to know the reason of this horrid spectacle, he was quickly informed, that as the first was the grand Traytor Abactanus , whom most opposed his Right and Reception; so was it the intention of the Justice of his Kingdom, to burn also the other people in his presence for the like wickedness, as the best testimony of their own Loyalty they could use, whereby to revenge his Fathers death. Although Arethusius had pitty sufficient in his disposition, to have saved a whole world of offenders; yet considering their crimes, he past by without speaking a word, onely casting down his eyes with a modest look, as if he delighted not so much in any Legal Cruelty, though necessity and example required oftentimes the effects: Notwithstanding he was no sooner out of sight of that spectacle, but the whole Pyle was set on fire by the common people, who appeared to triumph, if not to glory in the execution: This quickly brought the King to the outwardmost Gate of the City, where he found this written in Letters of Gold for his entertainment.  Dark Rebellion's gone: your splended Right Hath chas'd those Clouds; and given us a light: Your Sword may conquer Foes; but we are wone To dye, if not to wait upon your Throne. The Fates have trifled all this time; they knew No mortal spight could long contest your due: It 'twas their craft to let your Subjects see, All were but Slaves, and you have set them free. Thus blest the Gods and you such mercies have, To give relief before our sins durst crave: Jove hath determin'd so; the Pawn is given, He must have you, and you are now our Heaven. When some discourses had past upon these Writings, the whole company proceeded to the chief Palace, where being arrived, a Crown of Starres was seen in a Circular Figure, to hang in the Ayre over the Building; not onely to the view, but the amazement of the people in that manner, prenosticating most happy Omens to his future Government; whilst the whole Senate in the interim were there attending, to deliver over their Authorities to the Kings pleasure. This now shall finish our Romance, that perhaps hath too long a season troubled the Readers patience; but as Fancies are creation of our own, and therefore for the most part please with some excess; so of the other side, I neither invite or compell any to the exercise. 'Tis true, I might here enlarge my Relations, by setting down the manner of
