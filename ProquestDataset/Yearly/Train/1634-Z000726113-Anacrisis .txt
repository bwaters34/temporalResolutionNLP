 Many would bound the boundless Liberty of a Poet, binding him only to the Birth of his own Brains, affirming that there can be no Perfection but in a Fiction, not considering that the Ancients, upon whose Example they ground their Opinion, did give Faith unto those Fables, whereby they would abuse our Credulity, not only as to true History, but as to true Divinity, since containing the Greatness of their Gods and Grounds of their Religion, which they in their own Kind did strive superstitiously to extol; so that hereby they would either make our Religion or our Affection thereunto Inferior unto theirs, and imaginary Matters to be more celebrated than true Deeds, whose envied Price, affectionately looked upon, must beget a generous Emulation in any Virtuous Reader's Mind. The Treasures of Poesie cannot be better bestowed than upon the apparelling of Truth, and Truth cannot be better apparelled to please young Lovers, than with the Excellencies of Poesy. I would allow that an Epick Poem should consist altogether of a Fiction, that the Poet soaring above the Course of Nature, making the Beauty of Virtue to invite, and the Horrour of Vice to affright the Beholders, may liberally furnish his imaginary Man with all the Qualities requisite for the accomplishing of a perfect Creature, having Power to dispose of all Things at his own Pleasure. But it is more agreeable with the Gravity of a Tragedy, that it be grounded upon a true History, where the Greatness of a known Person, urging Regard, doth work the more powerfully upon the Affections. As for the Satyrist and Epigrammatist, they may mix both the Two, who shadowing Truth with Fables, and discovering true Persons with feigned Names, may, by alluding to Antiquity, tax the modern Times. I have heard some with a pretended Theological Austerity condemn the Reading of Fictions, as only breathing a contagious Dissoluteness to impoison the Spirits, where such Works must be acknowledged as the chief Springs of Learning, both for Profit and Pleasure, showing Things as they should be, where Histories represent them as they are, many times making Vice to prosper and Virtue to prove miserable: I like not the Alexander of Curtius so well as the Cyrus of Xenophon , who made it first appear unto the World, with what Grace and Spirit a Poem might be delivered in Prose. The Ã† thiopian History of Heliodorus , though far inferiour to that for the Weight and State of the Matter, as fitted to instruct Greatness; yet above it for the Delicacy of the Invention and Variety of Accidents, strange, yet possible, leading the curious Reader by a baited Appetite, with a methodical Intricateness, through a Labyrinth of Labours, entertaining his Expectation, till he come unto the End, which he must seek, that he may understand the Beginning: A Work whereof the Author, though he had Loss thereby, (being a Bishop) needed not to be ashamed, his chief Person doing nothing that was not worthy to be imitated. But I confess, that the Arcadia of S.P. Sidney (either being considered in the whole, or in several Lineaments) is the most excellent Work that, in my Judgment, hath been written in any Language that I understand, affording many exquisite Types of Perfection for both the Sexes; leaving the Gifts of Nature, whose Value doth depend upon the Beholders, wanting no Virtue whereof a Humane Mind could be capable. As for Men, Magnanimity, Carriage, Courtesy, Valour, Judgment, Discretion; and in Women, Modesty, Shamefastness, Constancy Continency, still accompanied with a tender Sense of Honour. And his chief Persons being Eminent for some singular Virtue, and yet all Virtues being united in every one of them, Men equally excelling both for Martial Exercise and for Coutly Recreations, showing the Author (as he was indeed) alike well versed both in Learning and Arms: It was a great Loss to Posterity, that his untimely Death did prevent the Accomplishing of that excellent Work. Long since, being young, I adventured a Piece with him, beginning at the very half Sentence, where he left with the Combat betwixt Zelmane and Anaxius , and continuing till the Ladies were returned to their Father, intending further, if I had not been otherways diverted, meerly out of my Love to the Author's Memory, which I celebrated under the Name of Philsides ; intending to have altered all that followed after my Addition, having conformed my self only to that which went before; and though being there but an Imitator, I could not really give the Principal it self, but only as it were the Pourtrait, and that done by too gross a Pencil, Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum . It were enough to be excellent by being Second to Sidney , since who ever could be that, behoved to be before others. This kind of Invention in Prose, hath been attempted by sundry in the Vulgar Languages, as (leaving, as not worthy to be named here, those ridiculous Works composed of Impossibilities, and considering the best,) Sanazaruis's Arcadia in Italian, Diana de Montemajor in Spanish, Astrea in French ; whose Authors being all of excellent Wits, in a Bucolick Strain disguising such Passions of Love, as they suffered or devised under the Persons of Shepherds, were bound by the Decorum of that which they profess'd, to keep so low a Course, that though their Spirits could have reach'd to more generous Conceptions; yet they could not have delivered them in Pastorals, which are only capable of Affections fit for their Quality; where S. P. Sidney , as in an Epick Poem did express such things, as both in War and in Peace were sit to be practised by Princes. The most lofty of the other is the Marquis d' Urfee in his
