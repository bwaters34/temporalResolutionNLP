 to offer vp my poore mite, to the honour of the late Nuptials; betwixt the two most Noble personages, whose honored names renown the front of my Poeme) singled out (as in some parts harmelesly, and gracefully applicable to the occasion) The Nuptials of Perseus and Andromeda , an innocent and spotlesse virgine, rescu'd from the polluted throate of a monster; which I in this place applied to the sauage multitude; peruerting her most lawfully- sought propagation, both of blood and blessing, to their owne most lawlesse and lasciuious intentions: from which in all right she was legally and formally deliuered. Nor did I euer imagine till now so farre-fetcht a thought in malice (such was my simplicitie) That the fiction being as ancient as the first world, was originally intended to the dishonor of any person now liuing: but presum'd, that the application being free I might pro meo iure dispose it (innocenly) to mine owne object: if at least, in mine owne wrighting, I might be reasonablie  & conscionablie master of mine owne meaning. And to this sense, I confinde the allegory throughout my Poeme; as euery word thereof, (concerning that point) doth cleerely and necessarilie demonstrate: without the least intendment (I vow to God) against any noble personages free state, or honor. Nor make I any noble (whose meere shadowes heerin, the vulgar perhaps may imitatate) any thought the more mixt with the grosse substance of the vulgar: but present the vulgare onely in their vnseuerd herde; as euer in antient tradition of all autenticall Aucthours they haue beene resembled: To whom they were neuer  2 beholding for any fairer Titles; then the base, ignoble, barbarous, giddie multitude; The Monster with many heads (which the Emperor, in his displeasure, wisht to haue sprving all from one necke; that all at one blow, he might haue vntrunkt them) cui lumen ademptum ; without an Eye; or, at most, seeing all by one sight (like the Lami ae , who had but one eie to serue all their directions, which, as anie one of them went abroad, she put on, and put off when she came home) giuing vp their vnderstandings to their affections, and  3 taking vp their affections on other mens credits, neuer examining the causes of their Loues or hates, but (like curres) alwaies barking at all they know not: whose most honored deseruings (were they knowen to them as to others of neerer and truer obseruation) might impresse in them as much reuerence as their ignorance doth rudenesse: Euermore baying lowdest at the most eminent Reputations, & with who as in the kingdom of Frogges) the most lowd Crier, is the loftiest Ruler: No reason nor aucthority able to stoope them; though neuer so iudicially & religiously vrdging them: whose impartiall and cleere truth, not their owne bold blindnesse can denie; vnlesse they will dare to mutter with the Oratour touching the Delphicke Oracles, and say our Oracles of Truth , did likewise ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  encline to  4 Philip: putting no difference betwixt Illusion and Truth the consciences of learned religious men, and the cunnings of prophane. And then how may my poore endeauours, in dutie to Truth , and my most deare Conscience (for Reputation, since it stands, for the most part, on beasts feete, and Deserts hand is nothing to warrant it, let it goe with the beastly) reforme or escape their vnrelenting detractions? The Loues of the right vertuous and truly noble, I haue euer as much esteemed, as despised the rest: finding euer of the first sort, in all degrees, as worthy as any of my rancke, till (hauing enough to doe, in mine owne necessary ends, hating to insinuate and labour their confirmation, and encrease of opinion, further then their owne free iudgements would excite and direct them) still met with vndermining laborers for themselues, who (esteeming all worth their own, which they detract from others) deminisht me much in some changeable estimations ( Amicuse nim Animal facile mutabil ae ) whose supplies yet farre better haue still brought me vnsought: and till this most vnequall impression opprest me, I stood firme vp with many, now onely, with God and my selfe. For the violent hoobub, setting my song to their owne tunes, haue made it yeeld so harsh and distastefull a sound to my best friends, that my Integritie, euen they hold, affected with the shrill eccho thereof, by reflexion receiuing it from the mouthes of others. And thus (to omit, as strooke dumbe with the disdaine of it, their most vnmanly lie both of my baffling and wounding, saying, Take this for your Andromeda , not being so much as toucht, I witnesse God, nor one sillable suffering) I will descend to a conclusion with this; that in all this my seede time, sowing others honours, Inuidus super seminauit Zizania &c. Whiles I slept in mine innocencie, the enuious man hath beene heere, who like a venomous spider, drawing this subtle thred out of himselfe, cunningly spred it into the eares of the manie (who as they see all with one eye, so heare all with one eare, and that alwaies the left) where multiplying and getting strength it was spred into an Artificiall webbe, to entangle my poore poeticall flie; being otherwise (God knowes) far enough from all venome, saue what hath beene forc'st into her, by her poisonous enemy to sting her to death. But the allusion (you will say) may be extended so farre; but qui nimium emulget elicet sanguinem ; a malicious reader by straining the Allegorie past his intentionall limits, may make it giue blood, where it yeeldes naturally milke, and ouercurious wits may discouer a sting in a flie: but as a guiltlesse prisoner at the barre sayd to a Lawyer thundring against his life, Num quia tu disertus es, ego peribo ? because malice is witty, must Innocence be condemned? Or if some other, not sufficiently examining what I haue written, shall by mistaking the title, suppose it carrie such an vnderstanding; doth any Law therfore cast that meaning vpon me? Or doth any rule of reason make it good, that let the writer meane what he list, his writing notwithstanding must be construed in mentem Legentis ? to the intendment of the Reader? If then, for the mistaking of an enuious or vnskilfull Reader, who commonly being pr aeiudicia pro iudicijs , I shall be exposed to the hate of the better sort, or taken forciblie into any powerfull displeasure, I shall esteeme it an acte as cruell and tyranous, as that of the Emperour, who put a Consul to death for the errour of a publique Crier; misnaming him Emperour in stead of Consul. For my selfe I may iustly say thus much, that if my whole life were layd on the racke, it could neuer accuse me for a Satyrist or Libeller , to play with worthie mens reputations; or if my vaine were so addicted, yet could I so farre be giuen ouer, as without cause or end, to aduenture on personages of renownd nobilitie? hauing infallible reason to assure my selfe, that euen those most honoured personages, to whose graces I chiefly intended these labors, might they but in the lest degree haue suspected any such allusion by me purposed, as is now most iniuriously surmised against me, they would haue abhorred me and banisht me their sight. To conclude Hic Rhodus, hic saltus ; as I said of my life, so of my lines; heere is the Poeme; let euerie sillable of it be tortured by any how partiall and preiudicate soeuer (for as the case hath beene carried: I can now looke for no difference) and if the least particle thereof, can be brought, necessarilie or iustly to confesse, any harmefull intention of mine to the height imagined, hauing already past the test of some of the most Iudiciall and Noble of this Kingdome: if Malice will still make vnanswerably mine, what her selfe hath meerelyinuented, and say with Phisitians, that the fault of the first concoction cannot be corrected in the second, (my meat supposed Harpylike rauisht at first, into her vicious stomacke) Aud that as Herodotus is vniustly said to praise onlie the Athenians , that all Grecians else he might the more freelie depraue, so Malice will as licentiouslie affirme, that my Poeme hath something honourablie applicable, that the rest might the more safely discouer my malignance: And lastelie, If my Iudges (being preiudicd with my accusation, haue no eare left to heare my defence) will therefore powerfullie continue their hostilitie both against my life  & reputation, then Collu securi , I must endure at how inhumane hands soeuer (at least) my poore credits amputation: humblie retiring my selfe within the Castle of my Innocence,  & there in patience possessing my Soule, quietlie abide their vttermost outrage: defending my selfe, as I maie, from the better sort, by a cleere conscience, from the baser, by an eternall contempt.

My faire condition mones them: Even right thus Far'd the Phisition , Aristoxenus With still poore Socrates; who terming rude, Lustfull, vnlearnd, and with no wit indude The most wise Man, did adde yet, he is iust. And with that praise, would give his dispraise trust. For as a man, whom Arte hath flattery taught, And is at all parts, master of his Craft; With long and varied praises, doth sometimes Mixe by the way, some sleight and peruiall crimes As sawce; to give his flatteries taste and scope, So, that Malignitie, may giue her hope Of faults beleeu'd effect, she likewise laies In her strowd passage, some light flowers of praise. But tis not me ahlas, they thus pursue With such vnprofiting, Cunning, nor embrue Their bitter spent mouthes, with such bloud-mixt fome, In chace of any action that can come From my poore forme, but from the foot they tread Those passages, that thence affect the head. And why? who knowes? not that next spirit that is Organe to all their knowing faculties, 5 Or else, I know I oft haue read of one So sharpe-eyd, he could see through Oke and Stone, 6 Another that high set in Sicilie 7 As farre as , Carthage numbred with his eye, The Nauie vnder saile. which was dissite A night and daies saile; with windes most fore-right; And others, that such curious chariots made As with a flies wing, they hid all in shade, And in a Sesamine (small Indian graine) Engrau'd a page of Homers verses plaine. These farre-seene meruailes, I could neuer see Being made of downe right, flat simplicitie, How neere our curious Craftsmen come to these They must demonstrate, ere they winne the wise: But who are those you reckon Homicides In your rackt Poeme? I sweare, that diuides Your wondering Reader, far from your applause. Iioie in that, for weighing with this cause Their other Reason, men may cleerely see, How sharpe and pregnant their constructions be. I prove by Argument, that he that loues Is deade, and onely in his louer moues.
