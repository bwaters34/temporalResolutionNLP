 not presume so to do: I have endeavoured to avoid all occasion of Offence to all sorts of People; not reflecting on any mans Person, whether High or Low, &c. And therefore I hope none will be offended with me, though all kind of Sins are justly exposed, and Sinners reprehended; though (may be) some will quarrel with my very Title , and object, How can Sin be said to Travel to and fro? &c. To which I Answer, Notwithstanding Sin be a Domestick Enemy, yet as Satan is said to go to and fro in the Earth,  1 &c. to tempt, intice , and draw men into Sin, being a cunning Observer of every mans Temper, Calling and Inclinations ; so Sin , upon this account, we presume may be presented as a Traveller also.  2 See Caryl . I shall say no more, but leave it to the Blessing of God, whose Glory I hope, I seek, and desire to promote in all things. Reader , Tho 'tis true, there are Books (thou maist say) enough already; yet bear with me this once: which is all I crave, save an Interest in thy Prayers, at the Throne of Grace; VVho am thy Souls Friend, B. K. April 28. 1684. OR, THE TRAVELS OF Ungodliness  Shewing the Pedigree, Rise, Antiquity, and Original of SIN .  depravation of a Being than a Being at all: yet it would be well for Thousands, yea Millions of Thousands, if there were no Being for Sin in their Hearts, nor in the World. What sin is the Holy Apostle shews, viz. The Transgression of the Law ,  &c. doing what God forbids, or not doing what God requires; or doing of it in other manner than he in his Holy Word directs, is alike evil. And in these three Things doth Sin consist: These are the principle Parts of that Ugly Body, or Hateful Monster, who is the Subject of this ensuing History: And we hope none will be offended with us; beccuse in this Allegorical Discourse Sin is represented as a Person; sith the Apostle himself gives it the Name of Body; and also attributes the Members of a Body to it: Who shall deliver me from the Body of Sin and Death &c?  3 And in another place he positively calls Fornication, Uncleanness, inordinate Affections ,  4 evil Concupiscence, and Covetousness ,  &c. Members of this Body: Besides, what is that Old-man which he speaks of elsewhere, and exhorts the Godly to put off, but Sin ,  5 or the evil habits there of, which are corrupt, according to the deceitful Lusts : This Design is honest. And if I know my own heart; I aim at the Honour of God; and to make all men who shall read these Lines ashamed of Sin ; he being in this small Tract sat out to the Life in his, own natural, vile, ugly, and deformed Image. And that we may the better perform this great and profitable Work; it will be needful first of all, to discover the Pedigree, Rise, Antiquity, and Original of this abominable and black Tyrant . First, Negatively ; 'tis evident Sin is not of nor from God: He that is Holiness and Goodness itself, cannot be the Author directly nor indirectly of Sin or Ungodliness : A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit ;  6 from whom so ever therefore Sin derived his first Being, or had his Original; It is impossible he should be from the Glorious Creator of Heaven and Earth; for what soever God Created was Good: Every thing that had its Being from him hath some Good Originally in it; but Sin hath, nor never had, no good in it, but is altogether evil; the Evil of Evils, and therefore not from God. Yet we must grant that Sin is of great Antiquity, and hath been a long time in the World; yea, some there be who think he had his Conception or Original before Man was Created, because some of the Angels (as they conceive) were overcome, and fell by him before that time; but how, when,    [   Sin , of great Antiquity.  ] and by what means Sin entred into them, who were such Holy and Glorious Creatures consider'd in their first Estate, is as I judge beyond what any Mortal is able to demonstrate, therefore we shall state his Original where the Apostle doth:  7 By one man sin entred into the World , that is to say, Sin was Conceived, and had his Birth or Entrance into this World by means of our first Parents; but if it be ask'd by whom he was begotten, I answer by one Apollyon King of the Bottomless Pit, called the Old Serpent, the Devil and Satan; it was by his subtilty they were beguil'd, who whilst they stood in the State of Innocency, were as a most chaste, beautiful and undefiled Virgin, whom because he could not force, he cunningly enticed to his foul and unclean Embraces: yea, and upon their first yielding to this Cursed Serpent , was begotten this vile and evil Monster ,  8 Sin : Hence the Devil is said to be a Lyar and the Father of it ; ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   Sin , the Off-spring of Satan .  ] and upon this Account, Sin may be fitly called the Spawn of the Devil ; 'tis Originally his Off-spring, a Brat of his Begetting; and also bears a lively Image and Representation of him. Obj. But this you will say was the Original or first Sin. Ans. 'Tis true, and must also be granted, That that Original Sin , was the Original of all Sin ; for from that first Sin , by the help of the Devil, and man's evil heart doth all manner of Sin proceed. Original Sin hath been prodigious fruitful; for it would make a man admire to consider, what a multitude of filthy Brats or spurious Off-spring have proceeded from that first-Born of the Devil; yet all are but as it were Members or Parts of; and tend to make up the said Body and evil Monster: and this truly, of the Production of Sin , was Apollyon's Master-piece; for by the help and means thereof, he hop'd and resolv'd to erect his Kingdom, or raise his black and Hellish Monarchy: for since he could not be a Ruler (nor in a higher state than a Servant) in the Upper World; (no nor remain an Angel any longer there) he was resolved to be a King and Ruler in these lower Regions; and to set up a mighty Kingdom in this World in despight of God himself; whom he sought thereby to be revenged upon, for that great affront and indignity cast upon him; (as 'tis thought) he conceived, who being Created, in a higher and more glorious State than Man, should be commanded to be a Servant or Ministring Spirit to Man; and he was doubtless, moved also, with malice and rage against the Creature Man? whom he saw God had lately formed and placed in Paradise, and made Lord and Chief Ruler of the whole Universe; and to the end that he might, I say, effect or bring this his Grand Plot or Enterprise; about which was to eclips God's Glory, and utterly ruine Mankind: He saw there was no other way to accomplish it, but by the production of this cruel and merciless Tyrant, Sin ; and having craftily obtained his devilish Design, so far that the Hellish Monster was Conceived and brought forth: Immediately as soon as ever he entred into the World, even before he was one hour old; he began to act his Diabolical, Cursed and Damnable Pranks; so that by his first Essay or Entrance on his fearful Work or Enterprise; he gave sufficient proof to all that should ever live on Earth, of his Strenth and Cruelty; and what all Mortals must expect from him: 'Tis strange to consider, that a Brat just born; and as one would think wholly unexperienc'd, should be cloathed with so much power, and be fill'd with so great malice; for just as Apollyon Midwiv'd him into the World, he let flye his Sting; and thereby at once gave a Mortal Wound to the whole Lump of Mankind; not only all that then lived, but also all such who should in After- times live upon the Earth. The Nature of that woeful Blow; It may not be amiss if I further open and explain, before I proceed, since we all, to this day, feel it, and groan under the sad misery and dismal effects thereof: But ere I do this; let it be observ'd, that this Hellish Tyrant , at once in a great measure, did effect what Apollyon craftily,    [   The Nature of Original Sin .  ] in both respects, had purposed before to bring about; For, hereby he caused Man to cast off his ever Blessed and Glorious Sovereign, from whom he had his Breath and Being; nay not only so, but he begat a strangeness; nay, more than that, a cursed and irreconcilable enmity in the heart of Man to the ever Blessed and Holy God; which is a most dismal thing to consider of: neither could any other Enemy ever have done this evil and cursed Deed, but this Bloody Monster, Sin , only. Nay, and as he made Man to become God's Enemy; so he also caused God to become an Enemy to Man; (there being nothing so hateful and contrary to his Pure and Holy Nature, than Sin ) in so much, that now that Blessed Union that was between God, the Holy Creator, and Man his once happy Creature is broke. So that from hence you may see; This Tyrant flew, as soon as ever he was born, into the very Face of God himself: This was his great Cry then, and is still to this day, God shall not Reign, but I will Reign; and Apollyon King of Darkness; he shall Reign and Rule in the hearts of all men on Earth: Nay, and he became so great a Hater, and Enemy to God; that by that one act, he most wickedly defac'd God's Glorious Image; which was graciously stamped upon the Heavenly Soul of the Creature Man: Nay, and more than this; he by his Craft and malicious Enchantment, and that horrid Venome, which was in that poysonous Sting (with which he wounded the poor Creature) basely corrupted those great Nobles; who, as I may say, were the Attendants, Bosom-friends, and continual Companions of this High-born Soul; whose Names were (if I mistake not) these following, viz. [   All the Faculties of the Soul depraved by Sin .  ] 1\. Judgment , alias Understanding , a very Grave and Wise Counsellor; but now become blind, filled with Incredulity and Enmity . 2\. Will , a free and Loyal Friend to the King of Heaven and Earth; and one alwayes ready to stir up this precious Soul to that which was for her good, and her Sovereigns Interest; until he was by this Devilish Tyrant , depraved and wretchedly corrupted; being wholly brought over to promote the Interest of Apollyon : Neither, is there in any a greater perversness to the will of God, being filled with Pride; he ever seeks to exalt himself, and all who adhere to him above God, his Holy Word and Glorious Sovereignty. 3\. Memory , who before continually put the Soul in mind of all things God had commanded her to do; and whatsoever he had prohibited or enjoyned her not to do: but now so corrupted by this Enemy, and made so vile; that what she should remember she forgets, and what she should forget that she remembers. 4\. Affections ; and indeed there were none more basely changed, and drawn away, from God than these, before Sin prevailed, or entred into the World: They were like a most Chaste and Undefiled Virgin; but now so Corrupted and Carnal, that they are more disordered than any of the rest: Before they were alwayes set upon God, and took up delight and complacency in him, he being their only Object : But now the World , the Flesh ,; nay, this Hell- bred Tyrant, Sin , is sweeter, more precious and lovely to them than He. 5\. Conscience ; One who kept the Records ; and was alwayes faithful to the Soul before this unhapyy Day, or the hour of the Production of this Enemy of God: He made all the House to rejoyce, and break forth into singing, by the nature of his sweet Testimony, or Witness he always gave in, for and in behalf, of the Soul; but now so vile and depraved; that when he should reprove and charge the Soul with its evils he is asleep; sometimes he condemns for want of good Eye-sight when he should justifie; and at another time justifies when he should reprove and condemn. He is so far drawn aside to the Hellish Party , or Interest of the Black Prince ; that when some Men persecute, nay put the Saints of God to Death,  9 he tells them they do God service: These are some of those things that this vile Enemy did in part effect by than one Blow he struck our first Parents; nay, and more than this also; for He brought in, or did beget another most cruel Tyrant , who hath Reigned ever since with great Force and Rigour, subduing all under his Feet; his Name is Death : This, King of Terrour had never been, had not this Monster and Destroyer of Mortals given his Being to him; in a word, you may perceive, he became an immediate Plague to the Soul of Man; a Depriver of every Faculty, and a Destroyer of the Body: For it was he also who let in Sickness, and all manner of Diseases, which the Bodies of all Humane Creatures are subject to. Lastly, Hell , or the Lake of Fire , comes to be prepared by his means: 'Tis he I mean who brings in Eternal Death . There had been no Hell had it not been for Sin .  Sin's worse than Hell ; It dug that horrid Pit: 'Tis Sin that casts poor Sinners into it. No Lake of Fire , no Tophet had there been For Souls of Men; no Death but through Sin .  Shewing how Apollyon , Prince of Darkness, having a design to send Tyrant Sin , as his Grand Agent, to Travel into all Quarters of the Earth; he ( First ,) Gave him his Commission: Secondly , Warning of his Enemies. Thirdly , Directions how to overcome, and destroy them.  Hell-bred Tyrant, Sin , having briefly been opened to you; Apollyon having now nourished, and brought him up fit fot his Turn, Work and Service; and finding he had already so wonderfully succeeded in his first and main Enterprize, he loved him dearly, fed him at his Table, lay him in his Bosom, and taught him all, or great part, of his Hellish Policy; by which he saw he would be a true and faithful Friend to him, and a a rare Foot-stool or Stirrup for him, to mount or raise him up to his long'd-for Sovereignty: and finding him, by this time, grown to some considerable Maturity, resolved to send him abroad, to Travel into all Quarters of the Earth, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) We intend no more by saying Sin is sent to Travel, but these Temptations of Sathan to stir up all People to sin ; for in this sense the Devil is said to go to and fro on the Earth as a Watchful Traveller: For Sin otherwise, 'tis granted, is a Domestick Enemy.   ] to manage the Affairs of his Infernal Kingdom, greaten his Power, and actually subdue all Enemies under his Feet, in all Nations, Countries and Kingdoms of the World. But before the Tyrant enter'd upon this woful Journey, we will suppose the Black Prince gave him his Commission, and Instructions, how to proceed in all his Atchievements; to whom he addressed himself after this manner: My most dear and beloved Child, the true Image of thy Father, and choice Darling of Hell, and the only Hope of this Infernal Lake, whom my Lord Lucifer, Beelzebub , and other Inferiour Princes, as Belial, Sathan ,  &c. do adore: Hearken to thy Father, who begat thee, and gave thy Being to thee: Thou art my Creature: What are I, though the Powers of Heaven hate thee? I will, in spite of all thy Mortal Enemies, make thee Great, and raise thy Honours, and Crown thee as King and Chief Ruler throughout the whole Universe: And all who will not obey thee, and yield Subiection to thee, I will raise all manner of Mischief upon them, make them miserable, yea, and tread them under thy Feet. Thou seest how successful already thou hast been, and what a mighty Conqueror thou art become in thy very non-Age. Thou hast, at one Blow, defeated all the Hopes of this New-born Mortal, and crushed him to pieces in the very Bud. He that was, the other Day, the Darling of Heaven, who swam in Pleasures, and was mounted so high in Sovereignty, Glory and inconceivable Grandeur; shining as a Star of the first Magnitude; possessing perfect Union and Communion with his Creator: Is now by Thee, by the Power of thy Hand, and Success of thy Arms, made miserable; and become so hateful to him whose Delight he was, that he hath cast him off, and turn'd him out of Paradise . Ah! How I laugh to see it? How is he become the Reproach and Scorn of all the Princes, and mighty Host of this unconquer'd Lake? What care I, though there is much bitter Enmity put between Me, and the Woman's Seed? Do I fear what Hurt any one, that shall proceed from her Loyns, can do to me? If thou in thy non-Age hast done such mighty things, and overcome this excellent Creature, when all his Internal Powers were utterly averse to us, and no ways inclined to favour our Interest; What can any of her Off-spring do to our hurt, much less break my Head, or destroy thy Sovereignty, since now we have got so strong a Party to our side, in their own House? Thou hast been so happy in this late mighty Victory, that the Powers of that Noble Soul, possessed by this Creature, is at once brought over to us. I have a purpose ( my dearest Darling ) to send thee to Travel to and fro in the Earth, until thou hast gone through the whole Universe: And, to my Joy, I find all People are prepared by thee, and made willing to receive thee; for all their Faculties seem inclined to entertain thee: so that I have no cause to doubt of an happy Progress. I am sure thou wilt find a ready Welcom in all Places, not only amongst the Poor, and baser sort; but amongst the Mighty and Noble Ones of the Earth. And now therefore know,    [   Apollyon gives Peccatum , or Sin , his Commission.  ] that I am thy Prince, and only Sovereign; and I do here give thee a Commission, a Pasport ready drawn, and signed for thee by all the high and mighty Lords of these dark and vast Regions; with certain Instructions how to carry thy self in all thy Travels, I have also prepared for thee two great Wings, that sometimes (as need shall require) thou may'st flye to and fro, and be as swift as Thought. The vast Deep shall be no Let to thee: Thou shalt pass from Port to Port, from Place to Place, from one Land and Kingdom to another, without Ship or Gally, and shalt never need to stay for Wind nor Tide. I will also teach thee to transform thy self into any Form or Shape, at my Pleasure. And to hide thy Sting, and ugly Visage, I have provided thee a Cloak, which thou shalt have power and skill to alter, or change the Fashion of, as will best suit thy Occasion at any time. Be thou sometimes a Dog , to fawn; a Dragon , to devour; a Dove , to seem innocent; be a Serpent or Fox , for Subtilty; a Lyon , for Strength: and in all thy Travels, observe the Constitutions, and natural Inclinations of all People. Build rather thy Nest amongst Willows that bend every way, than on Tops of Oaks , whose Heads are hard to be broken. Fly, with the Swallow , close to the Earth, when Storms are at hand; but keep company with Birds of greater Talons, when the Weather is clear; and never leaves them, till they look like Ravens . Creep into every Bosom. Fear not to approach the Courts of Emperours, Kings, Princes , and Noble Ones of the Earth: For I will cause thee to find Favour amongst all Ranks, Degrees and Conditions of Men. I will teach thee to get in at their Eyes, Ears, Mouth; nay, a thousand ways thou shalt have to invade them, and to spread the Wings of thy Infection over them. Make every Head thy Pillow to lean upon; and use it like a Mill, to grind Mischief. When thou meetest a Dutch-man , teach him to Drink; when with a French-man , teach him to Stab; when a Spaniard , how to Betray; present an Italian with a fair Damsel, and teach him to Poyson: when thou meetest a Scot , teach him False-heartedness; when with an Irish-man , teach him to Forswear himself; when an English-man , to do all this. Pursue great Men hard; they are my very good Benefactors; and their Example hath commonly a great influence upon those of a lower Rank. Hunt Taverns; there thou shalt find brave Youths easily overcome. Erect store of Play-houses ; for they tend greatly to the enlarging of my Principalities; there I keep my Market, and vend my Ware more abundantly, or offer my rotten Goods to sale, burnished up bravely to the eye, enough to bewitch all who lack Understanding, to dote upon them. Be sure to beset (on every) side the Younger sort; for if thou canst get possession of their Hearts timely, thou wilt find it easie to keep them safe, enough, and make them thy constant Slaves and Vassals to the end. And when thou meetest with them afterwards; shew them the Glory of this World ; allure them with thy Pleasures ; and hold forth thy Golden Apples to them: But if, that sorry Fellow, Conscience , at any time, gets power to frighten them, promise them Late Repentance, and assure them of Long Life; and thereby thou wilt soon overcome them. When thou meetest with the Rich , tempt them to trust in it; set their Hearts upon it; and to make their Bags of Gold , and Silver , their God; and to grine the Face of the Poor ; and force them to sell their Commodities cheaper than they can afford them; and not give them a Penny to relieve their Necessities: For thereby thou wilt subdue them both at once: for the One I am sure of; and the Other will be so hunted with one of thy Off-spring, called Carping-Care , that if Light-fingers ,  10 doth not overcome and tempt him to steal, the other will break his Heart, and force him to take the Name of God in vain; and not think of any thing else, than what will tend to the strengthening of thy hands, and conduce to my Interest in him, When thou comest to meet with such who are naturally inclin'd to Ambition, or have an eager desire and thirst after Honour, suit thy Bait accordingly; teach them how to contemn their God , their Conscience , their good Name , the Law and Religion too; that so they may the better mount the Hill of Ambition and Earthly Grandure . When thou dost approach to a melancholly Person entice him to be alone, and not to open his mind to any Body as he tenders his Life; also perswade him no Body, in the World, can tell what his Distemper is; and to make him believe he is damned: Nay, tell him there is no way but to Hell he must go; and then we shall between us, perhaps, entice him to hang, drown, or poyson himself, or cut his own Throat; and so we shall destroy many of these silly Souls; and that way enlarge our Kingdom. When thou meetest with an old Man, make him conceited, vain-glorious, fretful and very peevish; fill his Noddle with Tales, and old Stories; and to put them off the better, tempt him to add to them. When thou comest to married People, make one jealous of the other: If a Man have a beautiful Woman to his Wife, trouble his thoughts without just cause; because she is fair make him conclude she is false; and every one that looks on her, perswade him, loves her: If she speaketh him fair let him believe she feigneth; if she behave her self dutiful, make him think she then doth counterfeit: When she goes abroad, fill his Head with fear and make his Heart pant: If she be neatly dressed, perswade him 'tis to allure and please others; If she be homely dressed, 'tis because she knows he will keep House that Day. If by any means we can but kindle this spark in either of them, to be jealous- headed; we shall do our business effectually: But however, since the Man is so foolish to fear without cause, entice the Woman, if possible, to be revenged on him. Be sure do what you can to make discord between every Couple; when one is hot let not the other be cold; suffer not one to throw Water upon the Fire which the other kindles; for by this means we shall set the House on Fire, and then warm our selves with the heat thereof: Teach them to live either below what they have, or else above what they have; and if they have Children, I will give thee Instructions about them hereafter when thou enters the Country of Non-Age : If they go behind hand, thou must stir up the Husband to lay all the Cause thereof on his Wife; and let the Wife charge the Husband wholly with it; do what thou canst, be sure, in the Morning and Evening, to prevent Prayer; for that I fear more than all the Pope's Holy Water . We must make the Fountain muddy, and then the Spring cannot be clear: Discords and Confusion, in a Family, does as much strengthen my Kingdom as any thing in the World. You cannot think, how I am pleased, how greatly it delights me to see Men and Women live at strife and variance. When thou meetest with a single, or unmarried, Person, perplex his mind continually about a Wife, and render his Life not worth regard without one: If thou canst tempt him to Uncleanness, do; I will stand his Friend in the Matter: but if he will marry, let him more mind the Portion than the Person; let his Inquiry be what Money she hath, not what Grace hath she as you love me. We must also find out such a one for him as may be a Plague to him, as Job's Wife was to him: Never let him mind the temper of the Woman; nor whether she will, or no, be a suitable Help-meet, so that she doth but please his Eye, and bring store of Gold aud Silver into his Coffer. When thou dost assault a cholerick, or passionate Man, raise his Anger to Madness; if thou canst, cause his mind to swell high and so full, that there may be no room left for any good word or motion: Make him, in his Fits, like a Spyder-poysonn'd Toad ; so that Reason, Modesty, Peace and Humanity may flye from him, as People do from a House that is all on Fire; let it be contumely, without any distinction, or respect, had to Friend or Foe, Aliant or Familiar; let him also add violence of hands, savage or monstrous behaviour, like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest; whose Waters cast up Myre and Dirt, fuming and foming like a muddy Channel, a distorted Countenance, sparkling Eyes, foul Language, hasty Hands; and let him not come to himself, nor speak a word to his nearest Friends for two or three dayes; nay stir him up in this mad Fit to run away, though there was no Cause for the Fude; and if thou canst, perswade him to throw the House out at the Window ; tare his Wives Linnen and fine Clothes to pieces, or break her Earthen Ware; or if thou couldst prevail (for that's our time) to perswade him to knock one, or more, of his Children on the Head, and then get away and hang himself; for so thou wilt do thy busines throughly, and make all we Devils brave sport: But know we are curious Observers of the Tempers and various Passions of Men; in some anger hath a quick and sudden motion, but presently ceases: This they call Choller ; and they think it is an Influence of some angry Planet ; let the Fools have their fancy; but I must tell thee, 'tis a Child of thy Begetting; but these are like Fire in Stubble , soon kindled and soon goes out ; or like Gunpowder , which no sooner thou puts Fire to it, but flies in the Faces of their dearest Friend : These they say are the best natur'd Men; but they may thank us for that excuse. But there are another sort, whom thou canst not so suddenly move; but when Passion is raised, it takes deeper hold in their Memory; and as this Fire is not so easily kindled, so neither is it easily put out: If thou dost but do thy Best, 'twill prove like Fire in Iron, which hardly taketh and long abideth. A Third sort there be, in whom thou may'st kindle this fiery Passion suddenly, and retain it perpetually; not desisting without Revenge. These are like Fire, which ceaseth not without the Ruine and Waste of that Matter whereon it hath caught. Mind thy Instructions; for by this Engine thou may'st destroy Thousands. There is yet another kind of People, which thou must attack; whom I perfectly hate, and hold for my Mortal Enemies; and they are call'd Saints forsooth: about whom we have held divers Grand Councils in Hell , how to destroy. These are They, who call themselves the Woman's Seed . Most Noble Prince , If thou canst beguile, deceive and subdue this sort, the Day is our own. Thou must do it, or it can never be done; for we can do nothing without thee. Therefore, I conjure thee, in the Name of my Lord Lucifer, Beelzebub , and in the Name of all the Mighty Thrones, Dominions, Principalities and Powers of this Burning Lake , to use thy utmost Skill and Policy: For what thou dost upon These, thou must do by Craft, and after a more wary and clandestine manner: For they have studied our Politicks , and are not ignorant of our Devices .  11 Yet, let me tell thee, There are some who bear that Name, and are acounted of their Company; who are our good Friends , and indeed as serviceable to our Interest , as most in the World. But as touching Advice , and Counsel , how thou shouldst prey upon those my grand Enemies; I shall forbear at present, it being a Secret that ought not to be revealed: I shall give thee therefore Instructions hereafter, when thou meetest with them in the Town of Religion , how to betray, and overcome them. Moreover, there are divers other Ranks, Qualities and Conditions of People, with whom thou wilt meet in thy Travels , which I have not yet mentioned; viz. Noble-men, Counsellors, Lawyers, Doctors ,  &c. and all sorts of Mechanicks: But when thou enters into the Town of Commerce , thou shalt have Advice and Directions how to handle them. And now, because I am sensible of the great Weight and Importance of this grand Enterprize; and how by thy Travels I am like to lose or win all; I am resolved to accompany thee continnally, to the End of the World. I will go with thee, and be as a Servant to thee. And I must tell thee also, I have got the Skill to transform my self into any Shape: If need be, I can be an Angel of Light ,  12 and become Devilish Godly: We must both sometimes be very Religious; for else, how should we set up our Spiritual Kingdom; for such a one I have, and shall have, as well as a Fleshly: and the Advantage thereby to us is, and will be, very great; otherwise we should never have spent so much Time, and held so many Grand Cabals in Hell, about contriving, ushering in, and establishing this our Ecclesiastical State in the World. Lastly, That we may not lose time, I shall only admonish thee of divers grand Enemies, which thou must be aware of, and throughly revenged upon; or all our Design will prove, in a great measure, fruitless: I shall therefore, ere thou begin thy Travels , give thee their Names. [   Who are Sin's Enemies.  ] The First is a Paper-Enemy , a contemptible Foe to look upon; and yet I dread him more, than all the Powers of Heaven and Earth: May it please your Greatness, 'tis a Book; not a Play- Book; no, no, that is an Engine of my own forging: nor a Conjuring Book; for that same thing hath often made me brave Sport: nor is it a Song-Book; no, nor a Book of Philosophy , nor Physick:   [   The Holy Scriptures a great Enemy to Sin .  ] But 'tis the Bible . I could wish all the Plagues of Hell to light upon it, if that would do: But I see all in vain; for 'tis under the perpetual Care of Him , who Reigns Above, and cast me down into these lower Regions . We must do, therefore, what we can, to keep all Men ignorant of it; and not suffer them to have it in their Mother Tongue : Or, if we cannot do that, then take off their Hearts from it so, that they may not read, meditate upon it, nor remember what is contained in it: For 'tis like a cruel Sword with two Edges; which if they have got Skill to use it, it will destroy thee utterly: Yet do not fear; for I can teach thee to use it so, as to turn the Edge of it against themselves, and wound them with their own Weapon. Besides, I will shew thee how to magnifie some other Books, and unwritten Verities, mere Inventions of our own devising, above it; and raise up others, to cast it away as a dead Letter; and also to wrest it, and to make a Nose of Wax of it; and cause Thousands to believe, that it doth not belong to Lay-People, to read it; and forewarn them not to study it, on their Peril. [   Theology hated by Apollyon .  ] The Second Enemy I must advice thee of, is one Theology ; a Holder-forth, a Preacher forsooth; that gives himself up wholly to study,  13 how to bring both Thee and I to shame; nay, and to destroy thee utterly. This Fellow prys into all our Secrets: But I will teach thee, how, one way or another, to be revenged upon him. [   The Holy Spirit Sin's dreadful Enemy.  ] The Third Adversary is a Spirit , some call him the Holy Spirit . I must confess, he is a powerful Enemy; and I cannot deny, but he hath been sometimes too hard for all the Mighty Powers of this Burning Lake. Whensoever therefore he breaks in upon thee, with his Sword drawn in his Hand, he will slay thee at once: nay, such cruel Hatred he hath to thee, that no other Death will satisfie him, but to crucifie thee; which grieves my very Heart to think upon. Therefore, beware of him, and keep the Door shut (where thou hast Possession) against him. Moreover, I shall teach thee many other ways, to quench his Heat, and hinder his prevailing Power upon Men's Hearts;  14 yea, tire his Patience; and grieve him so,  15 that he shall strive against thee, nor appear for their Help any longer. The Fourth is a rare and beautiful Damsel; her Name is Grace ;    [ Grace a great Enemy to Sin .  ] and she hath also several Sisters; as Faith, Hope, Charity ,  &c. It grieves me to think, thou should'st at any time be worsted, and utterly vanquished by any of the Feminine Gender: But thou wilt sustain great Loss, I perceive, by her Means; for she has a cruel Train of powerful Enemies, to torment us continually, attending of her: Yet I shall teach thee, how to marr her Beauty, and spoyl her Growth. The Fifth Enemy is called Knowledge of God ;    [   Knowledge of God , a great Enemy to Sin .  ] but I think, there is no great fear of him: for the greatest Part of the World, I doubt not, but we shall keep in Ignorance , in Heathenish and Popish Darkness: But if he gets in, he will do us great hurt, by discovering all our Intreagues. The Sixth is one Morality:   [   Morality an Enemy to Sin .  ] I hate him as a Man hates a Toad . Yet, as we will order Matters, he shall do us a great Kindness; for he is not very well known; and so we will cause divers silly Creatures to trust in him, for Life and Salvation . That way we shall bring some solid Blades to Hell , with some Hopes of Heaven in their Noddles. The Seventh is a scurvy, obstinate Fellow, called Enlightned Conscience ; that never will be bribed: nor doth he fear Frowns, nor regard Flatteries. I doubt he will prove a Plague to thee in all thy Travels ; but I will shew thee hereafter how to deal with him. The Eighth , is a strong Engine of War ;    [   Prayer a great Enemy to Sin .  ] an Enemy , that has made the very Foundations of Hell it self to shake: I think they call him Prayer ; but he can do little hurt without Faith ; and I will teach thee many rare devices to make him ineffectual; there are some Prayers thou needest not fear, viz. such that some use with Beads, &c. Prayer alwaies prevails accotding to the Nature, Holiness, Truth, Sincerity, Fervency, Skill and Care of the Person who uses him. The Ninth is, Repentance ,    [   Repentance, an Enemy to Sin .  ] a most powerful Adversary indeed, but fear him not if he comes not in timely, or approaches alone without his dreadful Retenue , whom I tremble at the thoughts of; which are these following, viz. Godly Sorrow, Holy Revenge, Vehement Desire, Spiritual Indignation, Filial Fear, Heavenly Care, Self- clearing, Fiery Zeal ,  &c. The Tenth Enemy is, Consideration ;    [   Consideration Sins Enemy. ] who is truly the Ringleader to all the Mischiefs, Troubles, Wars and Disquietments raised up in my Kingdom ; and were it not for him I would not fear any Adversary on Earth; therefore thou must prevent his coming to the assistance of the Partyes thou dost encounter with, which thou mayst do by filling their Minds with the Cares of this Life; also render him odious; dangerous Fellow; having made many a brisk Youngster a meer Mome ; causing them to hang down their Heads like Bull-rushes ; to fold their Arms, and to spend their Dayes in Tears and sighing ,; and that he hath caused many to go besides themselves, or to run distracted. Moreover, thou mayst drive him away, by sending the Party to some Play or Tavern or such like diversion. The Eleventh are, Truth and Justice ,    [   Truth and Justice Enemies to Sin .  ] both implacable Enemies to our Empire; but I am resolved to do what I can to make them wander like Vagabonds in the open Air; for Truth shall find no Lodging, unless it be with a Mute ; and Justice , thou shalt throw her down in the Streets; and Equity shall not enter. We will so handle her, that few or none shall know her when they see her; they shall indeed have her bare Name, but not her Nature; for I have ready at hand in every Kingdom, a Multitude of such brave Catchpoles , that I hope they effectually do her her Business: Let her flye to Heaven; what hath she to do on Earth? and as for her who bears that Name, we will turn her Sword against our Enemies (and as much as in us lies) to spare our Friends. The Twelfth Enemy is, one whom they call True Godliness ;    [   True Godliness a great Enemy to Sin .  ] who hath been travelling up and down, a long time, to undermine my Kingdom: He is made up, they say, with a right Faith and holy Life ; but I am glad he meets with no better Entertainment. Now, my grand Design by granting thee this Commission, is to spoil his Enterprize; and finally, to vanquish him out of these lower Regions. Now therefore ponder well what hath been said; and bestir your self; flye to and fro, East, West, North and South ; besite all Mortals; my Instructions will serve for every Age; and will suit with all Climates and Countries throughout the whole Universe; but chiefly I aim at the Latter Times. Be gone, my Darling , and raise my Honour; and let my Renown break forth in all Quarters. Cloath my ambitious Children with Ornaments of Gold, and crown them with Glory and Honour; fill the Voluptuous with Pleasure, and all the Delights of this World. Let the Envious and Cholerick, have all the sweet Revenge their precious Hearts can desire; glut them with Rapine, Massacre, and Murther. Set one man against another; Husband against the Wife, the Wife against the Husband; Parents against the Children, and Children against their Parents; and teach Masters to be Cruel to their Servants, and Servants to Rob and Steal from their Masters; promoting Lying, Swearing, Whoring, Blasphemy, Atheism, Flattery, Drunkenness, Cruelty, Pride, Hard-heartedness , and all manner of Debauchery . Raise up Wars and Commotions in every Kingdom; let all before thee be put to Fire and Sword. Introduce Superstition, Heresie, false Doctrine, and gross Idolatry. Visit all in thy Journey; the Young, the Old, the High, the Low, the Rich, the Poor, the King on the Throne, the Beggar on the Dung-hil. Let Truth, Righteousness, Justice and Equity, Conscience, Charity, Fidelity, Simplicity and Modesty, be banished all the Regions of the Earth. Thou art my great Agent, and hast thy Patent of Assignment and Grant, from me the great Prince of Darkness, whom thou must daily Honour; and under whose Standard, continually advance thy Colours, and spread the Flag of my Authority; by which, not only the Lodges and outward Gates of all Courts and Cities of the World, but also the inward and inmost Chambers and Closets therein, will soon fly open and give way to this strong Commission: Thou hast the World, the Flesh, and me the Devil; nay, all Devils and Infernal Spirits, for thee to side with thee and take thy part. All Men are ready to receive thee; no Tradesman nor others, can well live without thee; but be sure remember, thou never be satisfied to take up thy Quarters in their Barns nor Stables, nor in their outward Courts nor Castle-Yards, but command the best Room they have, viz. their hearts; and be sure where thou comest to sway the Scepter, and make them all subject to thee; and become thy Servants and Vassals for ever. Let me see thee bring Millions of Millions, into these dark Regions, to dwell with us in Everlasting Burnings.  Shewing how the haughty Prince and bloody Tyrant Sin, the grand Agent of Apollyon, began his Travels: Also what a strange Retenue doth accompany him; and his great Success in the beginning of his actual Enterprize.  resolved (you may conclude) for his Journey; but pray note one thing by the way, touching his Instructions, viz. They were not (you must know) all given at first, as soon as Man was fallen, and he entered into the World; for though we thought meet to put them together, yet they are rather suited (as you may perceive) for aftertimes. But before we come to speak of his present Travels , it is necessary to give you a Description of his Person, and Retinue: together, with a brief History of his first setting out, and abominable Transactions in ancient Times. First , As to his Person, he is the strangest Monster that ever you heard or read of; for he consists of a compleat Composition of all manner of Sins and Ungodliness ; and though he be but one entire Body, yet he hath a multitude of Members, and lives separately in every one of them; so that each Member may properly be said to be him, as if he was solely or entirely there. 'Tis not proper to say he is a Sinner , for he is got into a higher Orb than that Phraise can reach; for he is Sin ; not filhty, but Filthiness in the Abstract; not proud, but Pride; not covetous, but Covetousness; not a Liar, but Lying; not an Adulterer, but Adultery; not an Idolater, but Idolatry; and not a Heretick, but Heresie, & c. Secondly , He being in the Holy Scripture, compared to a mighty King, though a cruel Tyrant, whose Power and Authority is very great; it will do well to shew you what a Retinue he alwayes hath to accompany him in his Progress , alone. The 1. is, Apollyon , King of the Bottomless-Pit . The 2. Intollerable-Guilt . The 3. Abominable-Pollution . 4. Horrible-Shame and Ignominy . 5. Deceitful-Heart . 6. A Defiled-Conscience . 7. Famine 8\. The Sword . 9. The Pestilence . 10. Death , who is alwayes just at his Heels; and Hell , with the dreadful Wrath and Curse of an angry God, pursues him (and all that entertains him) very close, from whom there is no escaping. Moreover, The rich Presents    [   His Rich Presents.  ] the Tyrant Traveller carries along with him, which he offers to allure, entice, or ensnare, his Prey; are chiefly these, sinful Pleasures, Riches, Honours, and Length of Dayes. But stop my Muse; Apollyon is near, and seems to be in a great rage that his Agent is not gone. Apollyon . Haste thou mighty Champion; prepare for thy Journey. Subdue the World actually under thy Feet; fear no Enemy that seeks to undermine or counterwork thee. I like not delayes; lose no time; put the Mandates of thy Sovereign into present execution, before I raise all the power of this unconquered Lake to fall upon my Enemies; and consume all Mortals at once: for I swear by Lucifer, Beelzebub , and all other mighty Devils, I'll immediately shake the Foundations of the Earth, and anticipate there in thy business, and do my work my self; so that the Glory shall never redown to thee. At this immediately, with a great clap of Thunder, he disappeared. Upon which the cruel and monstrous Tyrant set forth,    [   Sin begins his Travels .  ] Apollyon following him close at his heels, to see him do his Business effectually, and to assist him in every Enterprize; and so it fell out, just as he began his Journey,  16 Cain and Abel were offering Sacrifices; and having intelligence of both their Dispositions, he made up to Cain's door, and there lay couching down, like a hurtful Beast, ready to devour; and secretly whispered into his Ear, to spare the best of his Substance to enrich himself; and also intimated to him, that all the he offered to the Lord was lost, and would never be rewarded; and Faith not being in Cain's House, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   Heart.  ] he hearkened to this cursed stranger, and did accordingly; yet he brought his Offering, least he should displease his Father Adam , who, it is thought, at that time, was High Priest, which Office, afterwards, fell to the First-born in the Family. But when Cain saw his Offering was not excepted,    [   'Tis likely Cain saw, saith Ainsworth , by some visible sign, that God had accepted Abel's Offering, and not his.  ] and his Brothers was, this Enemy being near, knocked at his door. Cain , Who is there? Sin , Have you, Sir, any room for a Traveller. Cain . What are you? Sin . A Friend, one that loves you dearly, and am troubled to see how you are abused, and basely dealt with, by your younger Brother. Can you bear the thoughts that he should be in the favour of his Maker, and be the only Darling of his Father, and you slighted and contemned in this sort. Cain , By this, I cannot bnt think thou art indeed a Friend, and dost bear good will to me; pray come in: And he presently lodg'd him in the best Room he had: neither do I read of any opposition made agaiust him, by any in the House. He had no sooner receiv'd him, but immediately (by secret Instigations and Instructions from Apollyon , who was glad to see him entertain'd) he applyed himself to him after this manner: Sin , Let this Villain Abel , be the Object of thy hatred: never speak friendly to him more in love; but let thy Wrath out against him to the uttermost: shall he be accepted; what's he; art not thou better than him? he will ere long (though thy younger Brother) be come thy Lord and Master, and Ruler over thee; and thou shalt be made a meer Underlin. Cain , I am truly of your mind; my Father and Mothers Heart, I find already is taken from me, and set upon this cunning Subplanter. I hate him as I hate a Toad; neither can I endure to see him: Thus Cain was fill'd with Wrath, and his Countenance fell; i.e.   [   The Hebrew Word signifieth, to burn or be inflamed, either with Anger or Grief.  ] he shewed himself full of Rage and Discontent. Sin , Most Noble Cain , Heir of the World; I have a Business of great Importance to impart to thee. Cain , Sir, what is it? Sin , I am a Servant to a mighty Prince, whose Power and Kingdom, 'tis like, thou hast not heard of it: and he hath a dear and cordial love for thee; and hath sent me to thee, with certain Instructions, to put thee in a way to be rid of this your Canting Brother; and I will assure you, 'tis high time, for he is now at Prayer, and begins to grow more and more in favour, & c. Cain , I am glad to hear this News; but which way can the thing be done? Sin , Sir, you will never be at Peace, nor have any ground to conclude your Father will make you his Heir; or indeed ever regard you; until he be rid out of the World: But if this be once done, all is your own. Cain . But how shall I do to get rid of him? Sin . Why, since there is none you can employ secretly, to do it; do you kill him; and then declare he murder'd himself, being evercome with Melancholly, or blown up with Pride and Self-conceit upon his late ambitious thoughts, in aspiring after Rule and Government. Il'l warrant you Sir, this will hide the Fact and you shall never be discover'd. Presently, upon this motion, Conscience stept in; and spoke after this manner: Conscience . Sir, do not this evil Deed; he is your only Brother; and his Blood will cry for Vengeance. Sin . What dost do my Cain ; why dost thou make a pause? Cain . I am hinder'd by a timorous Fellow in my House, whom I know not: some Body I think hath sent him hither, on purpose to be a Plague to me. Sin . regard him not; I will undertake to stifle him; and spoil his telling Tales. Go call thy Brother forth; and walk together in the Fields. Be sure carry it lovingly to him, lest he mistrust thee: and I warrant you he will talk with you about Religion, and condemn your way of Worship: and though he be your younger Brother, yet will undertake to teach thee: and if thou wilt be a Fool, and suffer it, do. Cain . I will try that, so far I am resolv'd to take thy Counsel. And immediately, away he went and call'd his Brother forth; and they walked together in the Field. Cain . Brother, what a vast Fabrick is here? This World, in which, we are placed, is full of great Wonders and excellent Rarities; and all after our Father Adam is dead will be ours; all the Riches, I mean, and Glory thereof: and my Heart, Brother, is wonderfully pleas'd with the thoughts of it: I desire no greater Glory, nor Happiness; though I have heard my Father talk of a Future State beyond the Grave, that exceeds all things here below. Abel . Brother, this World, and all the Wonders we do behold, doth shew forth the Glory and handy Works of Jehovah our Blessed God and Creator;  17 whose we are; 18 and whom we should serve: for he is a jealous God ; and executes Righteousness and Justice in the Earth: and is a Rewarder of all those who diligently seek him . Cain . You are a Fool; I do not believe there is any Reward for Justice and Righteousness, nor Vengeance for Ungodliness . Abel . Brother, it grieves me to hear you speak after this manner; for I have had evidence of his Mercy, and favourable Acceptance, already. I am afraid, truly, you are misled by some Enemy: The way you go in Brother is not good; Think upon the World to come. Cain. Wisdom is only with you: I see how you are swoln up with Pride; and what you aim at: leave off your talking of a World to come, for I believe none. Abel . Brother, you shew a very wicked, naughty, and unbelieving Heart; I am ashamed to hear your Discourse. Some Things of this Nature, 'tis rationally suppos'd they might discourse of: And Cain being, afresh, mov'd to Wrath thereby, took the Devils Counsel, and rose up and murthered him. See Reverend Mr. Ainsworth upon this Matter: ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) [   Cain spake unto Abel his Brother; but what they said, is not set down. The Hebrew Text hath here a Pause extraordinary; implying ( saith he ) further Matter. The Greek Version addeth, Let us go out into the Fields: And Thargum Jerusalemy addeth the same, and much more: viz. How Cain , when they were in the Field, should say, There was no Judgment, nor Judge, nor Other World to come, nor Reward of Justice, nor Vengeance for Wickedness, &c. All which Abel gain-say'd; and then his Brother slew him. It seemeth ( saith he ) to imply a Dissimulation of Cain's Hatred, in that friendly Converse with his Brother, till he found Opportunity to Kill him, &c. Ains. Ant. on Gen. 4, 5, 6, 7. pag. 22.  ] Thus this Tyrant aud Monster prevail'd; and, in a second Attempt, overcame the Fourth Part of the World. But see how Sin , and the Devil , deceiv'd Cain: The Murther was soon discovered; for lo, on a sudden, a mighty Cry was heard; Vengeance! Vengeance! God , who is the Searcher out of Blood, cryes, Where is Abel thy Brother? Nothing can be hid from his Eye. Murther shall not go unpunished: The Voice of thy Brother's Blood cryes to Me from the Ground . Guilt follows his Sin with the dreadful Wrath of God: And now thou art cursed from the Face of the Earth ,  &c. Behold the venomous Nature of this Tyrant ! Seven Abominations he let into Cain's Heart at once: 1. To Sacrifice without Faith ; 2. And yet to be displeased, that God respected him not. 3. Not to hearken to God's Admonition. 4. To speak dissemblingly, when Mischief was in his Heart . 5. To kill his own and only Brother , and that for Righteousness sake; and thereby to destroy, as much as lay in him, all the Righteous Ones that might have proceeded from his Loyns . 6. To deny the Fact , by saying, He knew not where he was . 7. And, after all, asketh not for Mercy ; but rather despaireth under the Sense of the Punishment , than convinc'd of the hainous Nature of his Sin : And so fell under the Condemnation of the Devil . But to still, or rather stifle, his Conscience , (if there was any left in him) Sin , and the Devil , enticed him away from the Presence of God , and (as Ainsworth hath it) from God's Word, and Publick Worship; to dwell in the Land of Nod : and to divert his Thoughts, by marrying of a Wife, and building of a City; which might also be for his better Security from his Fears, & c. But, after this, Sin proceeds further on his Progress: and, as he subdued all Cain's Seed in general; so, more especially, he overcame Lamech; First ,  19 By violating the Law of Marriage: Secondly , In committing of Murther: and, Thirdly , In glorying in it; I have killed a Man ,  &c. If he that killeth Cain, shall be punished seven-fold; then he that killeth Me, seventy seven fold . "It seemeth (saith an Eminent Writer ) to be an insolent Contempt of God's Judgment, and abusing of his Patience towards Cain ,  &c." Time would fail me, to shew distinctly, how Sin , by his Subtilty, generally prevailed in those Dayes; by his alluring the Hearts of Men and Women with Musical Intruments , and other Pleasures , and Sensual Delights and Profits of this World . Yet God , to contrary-work Sin , and Apollyon , Prince of Darkness , and to preserve a Godly Seed , that He might have a Church in all Ages, and fulfil his Promise to Adam , gave Eve another Son, instead of Abel , whom Cain slew; whom she called Seth: "Who was Born (saith Ainsworth ) not till One Hundred and Thirty Years after the Creation ." This Seth begat Enos ;  20 so he is called in Greek ; in Hebrew, Ænosh: that is, by Interpretation, Sorrowful, Grievous, Sick, Miserable: So named, 'tis thought, from the Consideration of the sorrowful State of those Dayes. For, it seems, that this Monster of Polution , and Destroyer of Souls , prevailed wonderfully, as worthy Annotationers make appear; by prophane calling on the Almighty ; calling Idols by the Name of the Lord , or making Images and Representations of Him. So high had Sin rais'd Apollyon's Throne , in those Times, that scarce One in a Thousand ('tis thought) but were subdued under his Feet, and became meer Vassals , and Slaves , to him. Yet Godliness , soon after, had One most Choice and Renowned Champion ; who bravely overcame this Hellish Tyrant ,  21 and his great Master Apollyon ;    [   Enoch .   ] and walked with God Three Hundred Years. But the Lord , seeing how Sin , and Ungodliness , every where abounded, tyrannizing and raging up and down, with amazing Impudence; 22 took this Holy Soul from these Lower Regions , to dwell with Him Above . But Sin , as on Eagle's Wings , pursu'd his Progress ; and, like a devouring and unsatify'd Monster , resolv'd to destroy the whole World again at once, or provoke the dreadful God of Heaven to do it; which, in a short space after, he almost effected, by corrupting the Earth ? that is, the Inhabitants of the Earth ; nay, and the Earth it self, (saith Ainsworth ) by the abominable Pollution of that Generation , was defiled: Which agrees with another Text. Sin is of an Infectious and Poysonous Nature , fitly compared to the Plague of the Leprosie ;  23 the Earth was defiled under the Inhabitants thereof. And this Corruption is especially applyed to Idolatry , and depraving of God's true Worship; as appears by other Scriptures : ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 24 Which was the grand Design Apollyon labour'd to effect by this his Hell- bred-Agent . Nay, and the Disease was Epidemical: 25 All Flesh was defiled thereby, and their Way corrupted;  26 that is, their Faith and Religion , and their Manners, Works , and Course of Life also, & c. Every Imagination , and Thought of their Hearts , were only Evil; and that, continually, all were in love with, receiv'd and harbour'd this cursed Monster: Every Door was open, and all Hearts prepar'd to embrace him, and bid him welcome: Every Faculty of their Souls were totally depraved, taken Captive, and overcome by him: So that, none but Sin , and the Devil , was regarded and subjected to by them of that Generation: God , and Godliness , were had in great Contempt. The whole World seem'd to be but a Mass of Filth , and detestable Corruption . The Sons of God, i. e. Men of the Church , or Children of Seth , were, by the Power of this Enemy , brought to mix or mingle themselves by unlawful Marriages, &c. with the Daughters of Men, viz. the Off-spring of Cain , the Cursed Seed . Nothing but Violence, Oppression, Injurious and Cruel Dealing , overspread the whole World . No Fear of God , nor Regard of Men. Rapine, Spoyl , and Murther aboundeth in all Places; and yet they seem'd to live free from Fear, and in the greatest Security imaginable; buying and Selling, Building and Planting, Marrying, and being given in Marriage. But now, see what followeth: The Vengeance of God pursues the Traveller: Heaven could not bear longer with such a Prodigious Traytor and Rebel . And therefore, that God might make an end of him, and shew his Wrath upon those who had cast him off; from whom they had their Breath and Being. Behold! what a mighty Flood of Water approaches? Now, nothing but Death! Their Joy is turn'd to Sorrow , and their Mirth into Mourning . Now, the Heavens weep,  27 and their Eyes pour forth Showers too. But their Cryes and Tears will not attone for their Sins ; for the Flood came, and took them all away.  Adieu, false World; see, see thy fearful Fate! Alas, thou wouldst not see it, till too late! What hast thou got (come speak) by letting in, And enteriaining of this Monster Sin? See, how thy Enemy, and Hellish Foe, Doth laugh at this thy Fatal Overthrow? Vengeance pursues, and will oretake all those, Who God despise, and with the Devil close. But Sin was not, at this Time, a perfect Conqueror ; all were not subdued, and brought uuder his Feet: For Noah had, before this Time, entertain'd True Godliness ; and thereby was deliver'd from Sin , and so from the Flood too.  28 Thee (saith the Lord) only have I found Righteous before Me, in this Generation: Come Thou, and thy House, into the Ark . And by this means was Ham spared, who was of the Seed of the Serpent . And hereby Apollyon had the better Opportunity to save the Cursed Traveller , who brought that fearful Overthrow upon the Old World , the Effect of God's Wrath; but the Cause was not utterly removed: The Sinner was drown'd; but not Sin: but contrarywise, he got fresh Strength and Power, and pursu'd his Progress with as great Rage as ever; and, like another great and overflowing Deluge , threatned Spiritually to drown and destroy the World again in such sort, as if that Flood was but a Type, or Figure, of This.  Two Floods I read of; One was caus'd by Sin ; That was External; the Other flows within. Noah escap't the First;   [   Noah himself was almost drowned by that Spiritual Flood, who escaped the Other.  ] such Favour found; But afterwards, by This, was almost drown'd. The former Flood of Water did extend But some few Dayes: When will the Other end? They both destroy'd: But Sin is far the worst; And 'tis more general too, than was the First. Waters shall drown no more; a Sign God hath gin: When shall we see a Rain-Bow after Sin ?  29  The File which this Traytor gave Noah , seem'd to be more, than some of his former Victories: He overcame him craftily by Wine; but Faith help'd him up again, and vanguish'd the Champion . After this, as the World multiply'd, and encreas'd in number;  30 so did Sin grow in Strength and Policy: And, first, he put the Children of Men to build great Babel ; which was a crafty Device of Apollyon: But God defeated that Councel , and confounded their Language: And then were they forc'd into all the Quarters. But this Traveller pursu'd them all, where-ever they went; and made them generally subject to his Authority, and become Servants to Lucifer, &c. for he drew them to Idolatry , and defil'd them with all manner of gross Pollution and Sensuality: Insomuch, that four great Cities,  31 viz. Sodom, Gomorrah, Adma and Zoboam , were totally laid waste by him, and became an Eternal Monument of God's fearful Wrath: For as this Horrid Monster filled their Hearts, and set them on fire with Unnatural Lusts ; (viz. Whoredom, Incest ,  32 Sodomy , and Buggery it self;  33 the Men leaving the Natural Use of the Woman, burn'd in Lust one towards another, even Men with Men, working that which is unseemly and abominable ) so God destroy'd them with Fire and Brimstone from Heaven ; which made them, at last, when it was too late, cry out:  Curs'd be the Day, that we let in This cruel Eenemy: O it is he, this Monster Sin , That makes us thus to fry! These Flames are sad, which on us cease; But we, too late, do cry: For we shall bear worse Pains than these, To all Eternity. Yet, God raised up a few in every Age, to witness against this Tyrant , and undermine his Kingdom, as Abraham and Lot ; but Lot in one Encounter was worsted; a brave Champion in his Day for True Godliness : afterwards Isaac ; and then Jacob ,  34 who was a Prince with God, and wonderfully overcome him: But that which proved effectual for the weakning of his Power; was the Covenant concerning the Womans Seed; which was afresh renew'd to these Patriarchs. After this God raised up Joseph , and his Brethern: This Joseph proved a mighty Man of Valour; in so much that he may be called the Male of Tyrant Sin , for notwithstanding, all the Wichcraft Power and Policy of Apollyon , and all the whole Infernal Lake: This Heavenly Warrier could not be made to yield: He neither regarded Frowns nor Flatteries; and the main ground of his constant resistance was; because he saw what a hateful Monster , and Enemy, Sin was in Gods sight: How shall I do this thing and sin against God ;  35 that was the Weapon by which he overcome; yet nevertheless, his Brethren, tho' they took up Arms against the Monster Sin were sorely worsted by him, and particularly, being moved with Envy; sold poor Joseph into Egypt,  36 but God was with him : and he came off, at last, a glorious Conqueror; though the Tyrant , by Policy, once put him to flyght when he lived in Pomp, and Glory, in Pharaoh's Court; he learned to swear by the Life of Pharaoh ; but at last, by means of Conscience ; an noble Offier for the Prince Light ,  37 Josephs Brethren did recover; the fall which Sin gave them; for he made them cry out, we were verily guilty concerning our Brother ,  &c. From these Mens Loyns, afterwards, a great Army arose, or sprung up; who did wonderful Exploits against this malicious Traveller and Champion of Hell ; they having at first, upon the Death of Joseph and his Brethren, a brave and victorious Captain to command them, called Moses ;  38 yet these possessed but a small Spot of Ground, in comparison of the whole Universe: and as touching the other, the greatest part of the World, Sin wholly ruled and tyranniz'd over them; and they became meer Slaves, and Drudges to the Black Prince ; so that of them we shall take but little more notice, but speak somewhat of Moses , that Man of God,  39 the Prince and chief Leader of Israel . This Man, at first was under dangerous Circumstances; being brought up amongst the Friends and Servants of Apollyon : who to entice him to his Party,  40 offer'd him all the Pleasures and Honours of Pharaoh's 41 Court: and 'tis thought if he had disserted his Prince , and took up Arms for the Enemy, he might after Pharaoh's Death been Crowned King of Egypt : But he having a mighty Shield in his hand; and being also otherwise compleatly armed, put the Enemy to flight;  42 and chose rather to suffer affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleasures that this cunning Deceiver offerd'd him for a season . But upon this a, sore and grievous, War fell out between the two Seeds; for Pharaoh by no means would tollerate or give liberty to True Godliness to live amonst them. Such was their love, and affection, to Sin and Satan the Prince of Darkness in those dayes: but for this their Wrath and Enmity he, with the Egyptians , paid dear: for Sin , with implacable malice, so hardened his heart, that notwithstanding ten terrible Plagues, he would not suffer them to go and worship the Lord their God :  43 Therefore Jehovah , at last,  44 destroyed them all in the Red Sea , But strange, indeed, was the Wrath and Malice of the Black Prince towards the Lovers of True Godliness before that final Overthrow: for one Hellish Contrivance they had, after another, to destroy them: one while to cut off all the Men-Children; but that not succeeding according to their expectation; then they made a Decree; that all the Males, as soon as they were born, should be thrown into a River: and at last they oppressed them sorely, by laying heavy Burdens upon them: yet all proved to their great detriment; for they increased the more thereby. But after the Overthrow of that Enemy, Sin stirred up all his powers to corrupt the Holy Seed;  45 and prevailed also exceedingly; insomuch, that many of them turn'd Idolaters, and forsook the True God . Now, some time before that Jehovah to convince them of their miserable Condition they were in, by entertaining this Enemy, he gave forth, or made, a holy and severe Law in a burning and fiery Mountain; the Tenure of which laid every Soul under a dreadful Curse that did entertain, 46 or at least countenance, Sin : or any way break a jot, or tittle of that just Law: and by reason of the depravity of their Hearts,  47 and weakness of their Hands through the Flesh, that Law greatly strengthened Sin's hands; and laid them and the whole World under Guilt and the heavy Wrath of an angry God; and many of them were cut off by the hand of Justice. (for Temporal Death, as well as Eternal, was denounced as the punishment of every Transgression and Disobedience thereof) Yet God , that Tyrant Sin might not thereby triumph and vaunt himself above measure graciously added another Law; that by the Types, Shadows and Sacrifices of it, they might by the help of Faith , see a Remedy; which was by the Death of the Messiah , that was promised long before; and should be revealed in the Latter Times. And now from that Time, until the Coming of Christ, 'tis needless for me to speak further of The Progress of Sin, or the Travels of Ungodliness ; The fearful exploits he did to the seven Nations, of the Land of Canaan ; whom he utterly destroy'd and gave up to God; Sins revenging hand; and also how by his subtilty he overcame the Children of Israel in the Wilderness; and when they came into the Land of Promise ; of which you read at large in the Sacred History ; and time would fail me to run through. Moreover, most fearful Slaughter and Desolation he made, and brought upon all the Heathenish Nations of the World: for nothing but Treasons, Wars, Murders , and merciless Devastations were made by him; laying all Kingdoms of the Earth aweltering in their Blood; and to groan under his heavy Yoak and Tyranny : In a word, many Millions of Souls fell by his hands; and divers grievous Plagues and Judgments for his sake were inflicted upon poor Mortals , almost every where. Some who were his Enemies, and Lovers of Godliness , he stirr'd up his Emissaries to starve to Death ; to burn burn alive; saw asunder , and throw'd into Lions Dens to be torn to pieces ;  48 and others to be stoned: So that all that opposed him, or would not give him Entertainment, were forc'd to wander about in Sheeps-skins and Goatsskins, being destitute, afflicted and tormented : and that which was most lamentable; was to find many thousands of them who professed, themselves, to be God's People (nay, and Leaders amonst them) so grievously deceived by him; that they became his meer Vassals ; and acted much of the sad Tragedy upon the Holy Seed ; insomuch much that one ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ Ahab.  ] who was a Prince in Israel sold himself to him to work Wickedness . Neither did those who were his professed Friends, and Servants, speed much better in this World, through his Treachery: For he to advance Apollyon to the top of his Glory, and Sovereignty, caused many of his Admirers to sacrifice their poor Children to Molech ;    [   This Molech was an Idol, made in the shape of a Man.  ] which was to throw them into a fierce Fire and burn them to Death: They burnt their Sons and Daughters , saith Sacred Writ , and sacrific'd them unto Devils, and shed Innocent Blood, & c. and  49 others he stirr'd up with Wrath and Malice to fight against,  50 and destroy, one another; that so every part of God's Law might be violated and trodden under his Feet: and Jehovah , to revenge himself upon them, for the Love and Kindness they shewed to this Murderer , brought the Sword, Famine and Pestilence , and other amazing Judgments , upon them: So that, by this Tyrant's means, were many made Fatherless and others Widows: Nay, no Misery , that Man's Heart can imagine, or Mortal Creatures be capable to suffer, or undergo; but he, with Vengeance, brought upon Adam's Seed , throughout the whole Universe: Nay, and he so blinded their Eyes, that, in some Nations, he caused many People to worship the Sun, Moon and Stars ; and, at last, the Devil himself; whom they called an Evil God , because he tormented them: and they durst do no less than adore him, for fear he, otherwise, would destroy them. Thus did this Monster roar and range about, and tyrannize after a most lamentable manner; neither was there any able to resist or hinder him, as (finally) to stop and overcome him, but the Man Christ by which means he did, in his Travels , even almost what he pleased, destroying Body and Soul too; and none could get out of his Hands, but they who look't unto Jesus ; who was promised, and long look'd and waited for. So that, these things consider'd, the Coming of the Messiah must needs be acknowledged an inconceivable Blessing to Mankind; who were thus spoiled, mangled, torn in pieces, and fearfully tormented by this cruel Tyrant: And indeed, great was the Expectation, and Breathings, that were amongst those, who were sensible of that dismal State the World , and their own Souls , were in. But hold! I must stop again; for I hear the Saviour and Glorious Messiah , and Prince of Righteousness , is come! Blessed News, indeed! Sing, O Heaven; and rejoyce, O Earth!  51 Glory to God in the Highest, and on Earth good News to Men! Well! But what Provision is made to entertain Him? Do they not look out some Stately Palace for Him? And do not Thousands, and Ten Thousands, swarm about Him, to Congratulate his Arrival, with all Expressions of Joy imaginable: For, O the Worth of his Person, the Greatness of his Glory, and the Nature of that Work He is come to do! Never before appeared such a Saviour and Deliverer! Now the Destroyer of Tyrant Sin , with the Devil , and all the Powers of Hell , is come! He is come! Ay, but where doth He lodge the first Night? Is the best Chamber shewed Him, and a Down-Bed ready made and prepared for Him? No, no; Sin , his Enemy, has got the Palace, the chief Room; he hath got the whole Rule and Sway in the Inn ; I mean, the Heart: and the Heavenly Prince is forced to go into the Stable , and take up his Lodging in the Manger . Oh! do not they deserve to be deceiv'd and ruin'd for ever, who hug, delight in, and kindly entertain, their Enemy; he that seeks to destroy and murther them; who, whil'st he smiles in their Faces, secretly designs to cut their Throats: And slight, after this sort, their only Friend ; nay, their Right and Lawful Prince and Sovereign ; whom all their Fathers, Holy Men , and Blessed Prophets Prophesied of; rejoycing to think of this Day? And shall He be turn'd into the Stable? What He, who hath Millions of Holy Angels to attend Him; whom the Glorious Seraphims , and Cherubims , do adore and fall down before? Is this his Welcom, his Entertainment, which poor Mankind do alot Him; who was the Joy, and the Delight, of his Heart ; and for whose sake, He is come to revenge Himself, and utterly overcome this Murtherous Tyrant, Sin , and spoyl Apollyon's Kingdom , or destroy the Works of the Devil?  Ah me, what shall I say! Can be exprest The Grief that seizes on my panting Breast? My Heart into a trembling Fit doth fall,   [   See a Book of this Author's called the Glorious Lover , pag. 19, 20.  ] To see how He contemned is of all. These Savage Mortals did this Prince reject, And treat him with Affronts and Disrespect. When He for them had taken all this Pain, They neither would Him know, nor entertain. The very Inn , where first he went to lie, For to vouchsafe Him Lodging did deny. No Room, alas! had they; but if 'twere so, He would be there, to th' Stable He must go. The silly Ass, and labouring Ox, must be Companions, now, to Sacred Royalty: Expos'd by greater Bruits, He must, Alas! Take up with the poor Ox, and painful Ass; Who their great Maker, and Preserver, was. Let Heaven astonish'd, Earth amazed be, At this ungrateful Inhumanity! Now, the Cause of this great Affront and Contempt cast upon this mighty Saviour , was occasion'd by Apollyon's Craftiness, or Devilish Policy ; for he had drest up this Tyrant Monster, Sin , in such Bravery, or external Gallantry, that he appear'd most Lovely and Pleasant in the Eyes of the Generality of the People of that Age, as well as of those who live in these present Times. Insomuch, that they were resolved to entertain him, and let him have the whole Possession of their Hearts, to Rule and Tyrannize over them. Apollyon , notwithstanding, beholding this Prince , great Dread seized upon him; fearing whether he should be able to hold his former Conquest much longer, or no: But as his Fear, so his Wrath encreas'd; and therefore, sought all means, by his Merciless Agent, Sin , to destroy Him: And to the end he might do it, he stir'd up Herod to Massacre all the Male Children of Two Years old and under, in the Town of Bethlem ; that so, that way, he might take away the Life of Jesus ; and preserve this his Beloved Traveller from a final Overthrow. But that Attempt being, by Jehovah , wonderfully frustrated, by calling the Prince into Egypt , he contriv'd another way; and that was, to see if he could destroy Him, by the Craft and Power of his own Arms; and so make Him bend, or yield, to his Hellish Authority .  But the horrid Massacre he brought to pass; And none more bloody, sure, there never was. If Circumstances were but weighed well; Both what they were, and for whose sake they fell. On those poor Babes , they no Compassion have; But hurle them from the Cradle to the Grave. The weeping Mothers rais'd a swelling Flood Of their own Tears, mixt with their Childrens Blood. In every Street was heard most dismal Cryes, Bewailing those unhappy Obsequies; As had been Prophesied long before, By Rachel's Moans, refusing to give o're. She sighs and weeps, and has no Comfort got; Because her pretty Babes , Alas, are not. Great was the Slaughter; yet his Hopes are crost: The Precious Prey this raging Blood-hound lost. For th' Prince had notice of this Cursed Thing, And fled to Egypt , from this wrathful King; And there remain'd, not being th' least afraid, Until King Herod was by Death betray'd: And when he heard what had that Wretch befel, He hasted back to th' Land of Israel : But News being brought of Archelaus Reign, He thought it needful to remove again. Apollyon , next adventur'd to proclaim open War against the Mighty Prince ; and was resolved (as I said) to engage him in a single Duel, in his own Person, Hand to Hand; for, he saw, the Hellish Traveller, Sin , could do no good upon Him, he having no Domestick Friend to assist him after the usual way of his Enterprize, no Lust being in Jesus's Heart ; by the Help of which he always overcame, in Times past, since the Fall: Yet, like a base Cowardly Villain , he waited to surprize the Prince on very advantagious Circumstances; viz. To assault Him when he thought He was become weak through long Fasting . Now, when he drew near, and beheld Him, he insulted over Him, vaunting and domineering after his Devilish , Blasphemous manner; not being able to endure the Sight of such a Rival , as he perceived Jesus was: And therefore, being ready to burst with Rage , and cursed Malice ; he brake forth, we will suppose, to this Effect:  Shall I, great I, thus lose my Lovely Prey, And see my Hopes all blasted in one Day; Which I have carry'd on in every Age, With deepest Policy, and fiercest Rage? My utmost Stratagems I first will try, And rather on the very Spot will dye. Thus Hellishly resolv'd, he doth prepare Straight to commence the bold and impious War. And now the sharp Encounter does begin; A Fight so fierce no Eye had ever seen; Nor shall hereafter e're behold agen. But, first, be pleas'd to take a Prospect here, Of the Two Combatants, as they appear: The First , a Person of Celestial Race; Lovely his Shape, ineffable his Face. The Other was a King of Courage bold; But very grim and ghastly to behold. Great was his Power, yet his Garb did show Plain Symptoms of a former Overthrow. But now, recruited with a numerous Train, Arm'd with Despair, he tempts his Fate again. Under his Banner the black Regiments fight, And all the wicked Troops, which hate the Light. His Voluntiers are spread from North to South; And flaming Sulphur belched from his Mouth. But let us behold the success of this Battel, on which all the Hopes of Mankind doth depend; should the Tyrant Prince prevail, the World is lost: Apollyon , be sure, will do his best; for he sees, if he be worsted his Kingdom will likewise fall  The King of Darkness the first Onset gave; Thinking his Foe to startle or outbrave. If thou be the Son of God, said he ,  52 command these Stones to be made Bread . He would have him doubt or question whether he was the Son of God: and then to satisfie his hunger, to work a Miracle at his Command, as if he did not know how to get Bread without taking it from Satan's hand; or must in an indirect way obtain it.  But the Blessed Lord did use his Sword so well,    [   Apollyon overcome in his first Assault.  ] That down the others Weapon straight way fell: It made him reel, and forc'd him back to stand; And beat his Dart at once out of his hand. It is written, Man shall not live by Bread alone; but by every Word that proceeds out of the Mouth of God: implying,  53 the Promise of God is enough to sustain a Soul in every condition, nay, in the greatest strait; and also shews, that God's Word, that Sword of the Spirit, is the best Weapon to refel Satans Temptations.  At which the disappointed wrathful King Doth gnash his threatning Teeth, and shews his Sting; Is mad, and foams; and fain the Fiend would bite. He swells like to a Toad, enough to fright A mortal Man on him to cast a look;   [   Apollyon strikes another Blow. ] And presently another Blow he struck. But first he caught, and carry'd Him on high; And in his Face again he thus did flye: If thou be the Son of God, cast thy self down? for it is written, He shall give his Angels charge concerning thee ;  54 and in their hands they shall lift thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy Foot against a Stone . The Devil will try if one Temptation will not do, whether another may not: and now he fights him with his own Weapon, viz. the Sword of the Spirit. The Devil can make use of Scripture when he can use it to wound his Enemy; but he acts like a Sophister, viz. leaves out that part of the Text ( To keep thee in all thy wayes ) which shews we must not tempt God,  55 to save our selves by any indirect wayes, especially such that are of the Devils choosing. 'Tis written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.  Apollyon now look'd pale, and trembled too, To see himself sustain another Blow. But presently, like to a Lion bold, Upon his Spear he furiously takes hold; And doth the third time the blest Lord engage With greater Violence and fiercer Rage: As when loud Thunder roars and rends the Sky, Or murdering Canons let their Bullets flye: So did he cause as 'twere the Earth to quake, When he at him, did now, the last time make; Because that now to's last shift he was driven; Almost of all his Magazine bereaven: But one poor Weapon more he had to try, If worsted there he was resolv'd to fly.  56  Again the Devil taketh him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and shewed him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them; and said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Behold the Impudence and Pride of Apollyon ; alas! how fain would he be a perfect Conqueror: He had by his Hellish Agent Sin , prevailed with Mortals so far, as to Deify him, and worship him, as a God: For we read, how the Gentiles sacrific'd to Devils ,  &c. as do many of the poor Heathens at this very Day: but this is not enough; this will not satisfie his ambitious Appetite: He would have the Son of God to worship him; the Glory of the World , that is the Bait; ay, but this will not do Satan: Do'st think this way to overcome the Son of God, because hereby thou canst overcome Man?  A cunning Stratagem he did devise, Thinking thereby our Saviour to surprise; The Glory of the World , the only Snare By which poor Mortals often ruin'd are. But can Apollyon think, by Craft or Power, Christ to orecome? can he a God devour? Shall fading Glories of vile Earth entice, Or be a Snare to him, when Paradise Could not upon him any Influence have, To turn his love from those he came to save? How soon deep Policy is overthrown; And crafty Fraud to foolish Madness come? Art thou Apollyon such a wretched Sot? Hast thou no other Bait nor Weapon got? Is this thy Wit? and canst thou do no more, Than give him that which was his own before? How prodigal thou seem'st? wilt thou bestow At once on him all Kingdoms here below? What then will all thy flattered Subjects do? If thus at once thou givest all away; What wilt thou do thy self another Day? Jesus saith nnto him, 57 Get thee behind me Satan ,  &c.  A hideous Clap of Thunder then was heard;    [   Apollyon vanquished and forc'd to flye.  ] And strait the cursed Spirit disappear'd. But after this Apollyon being greatly enraged, was resolved to be revenged upon our Blessed Lord, by threatning to assault him another time, when he hop'd to succeed better, and bring him under his Foot: and therefore at present he addressed himself to the Traveller.  'Tis thee Peccatum he would fain bring down; But fear him not, the Bayes shall be thy own; With which thou Crown'd shall be, and set on high; And sway the Scepter still both far and nigh: Yea, and o'er all shall have pre-eminence, When this our dreadful Foe is gone from hence. And after this, the glorious Prince was most basely and evilly entreated by Apollyon's Emissaries ; for this crafty Enemy blinded the Eyes of the poor Jews, in such sort, that they would not know him, nor believe he was the Messiah and mighty Saviour promised to their Fathers; and hereby the Tyrant got such hold of them, as to stir them up to load him with all manner of Infamy; calling him a Wine-bibber , a gluttonous Person ,  &c. a Friend to Publicans and Sinners ; nay, caused some of them to cry out he had a Devil (or a Familiar ) and is mad ; nay, and that He cast out Devils by Belsebub the Prince of Devils : and all this Apollyon did, and much more, to make him odious in the Eyes of the People, that so none might flye to him for Help and Salvation from this bloody and devouring Monster, Sin : And at last, the whole Infernal Lake consulted together, by the Aid of this damn'd Tyrant , to stir up the High Priest and Chief Rulers ; having fill'd their Hearts with Envy and cursed Hatred to accuse him with Blasphemy, Sedition and Treason ; that so he might as a notorious Criminal or Malefactor be put to Death; which thing indeed he came on purpose to do viz. to dye; tho' it was hid from them; for had Apollyon known, that the Death of Christ was the only way to destroy the power of Sin, Death , and the Grave ; and utterly spoil and bring down his own Kingdom; he doubtless would never have promoted that Work. But so it was, the Creature Man being, by the power and subtilty of Sin , brought under the breach of God's holy Law; which denounceth Death upon every Transgressor thereof; by which means the whole World became guilty before God of the highest Treason,  58 & c. owing more than ten thousand Talents to Dvine Justice, and had nothing to pay: now the Lord Jesus, out of Infinite Love, offered himself as the Creatures Surety, to undertake, and answer all the just demands of the Law; and make a compleat compensation to Justice for all the Wrong Man had done, by yielding to this Hellish Tyrant , to the manifest violation of the Law, & c. And since, without shedding of Blood, there could be no remission of the horrible Crimes they stood charged with; he laid down his own Life, that so by Death he might make an end of Sin , as to his condemning Quality; and destroy him who had the power of Death, which is the Devil; and deliver them, who though the fear of Death were all their Life-time subjest to Bondage .  59  That Work must needs be carried on indeed, When Heaven and Hell about it are agreed: Tho' different ends in those great Agents are; Yet in the thing they both agreed were; That Christ should be of his dear Life depriv'd, Tho' Hell alone the guilty Act contriv'd. Yet God indeed from all Eternity, Knowing what Rage and curs'd Malignity, Would be in their base hearts; resolved then He would permit and suffer those vile Men To bring his purpose and Decree to pass; Which for our Good and his own Glory was. But to proceed; how wonderfully was the grand Enemy by this mischievous Design baffled, and overcome; for that very way that Sin and the Devil thought utterly to destroy the hopes and help of poor Mortals, God took to save and deliver them; for loe after three dayes, the glorious Prince arose again from the Dead, to the great terrour and consternation of all the Powers of Darkness ; which was long before prophesied of: Seventy Weeks are determined upon thy People, and upon thy Holy City, to finish Transgression; and to make an end of Sin; and to make reconciliation for Iniquity; and to bring in Everlasting Righteousness ,  &c. Obj. But some may say ,   [   Christ destroy'd the power of Sin by his Death and Resurrection.  ] Did Jesus Christ by his Death, &c. make an end of Sin , and utterly spoil his Travels for the future. Answer , 'Tis one thing to destroy the power of Sin , and another to take away his Being; Christ having Fulfilled the Law, which was the strength of Sin , may be said to make an end of Sin to all who flye to him by a true and lively Faith; but, alas, Sin still mightily prevailed; and by his means a very few persons obtained deliverance from him: for he caused the Jews to require a Sign; and the Learned Greeks to seek after Wisdom; for Natural and Moral Phylosophy, about that Time, seemed to be the great Idol of the World, it being in the top of its Glory: and by these means the Gospel became a stumbling-Block to the one,  & Foolishness to the other: and such who did receive the Truth, by the rage and subtilty of Apollyon were exposed to sore and grievous Persecutions: For now nothing but Blood and Slaughters, this Monstrous Tyrant raised upon all those who listed themselves under Christ's Banner; so that in the space of Three Hundred Years, Millions of Christians were tortured, and barbarously murder'd; and all by the means and Instigations of this Bloody Monster, Sin . Nay, And should we proceed to shew, before and after these Times, the many Wayes and cunning Stratagems they then used to continue, enlarge and establish Apollyon's Hellish Kingdom, it would fill great Volumes. First , They endeavour'd to blacken the Followers of Godlieness with all manner of horrid Crimes imaginable; to the end, that all ignorant People might not be won, or brought over to close with them; but contrariwise loath and hate them, and be moved without remorse or pity; to reproach, persecute, and inflict, all manner of Cruelties upon their poor, frail and innocent Bodies; for they put the Christians, as some observe, into Bears skins ; and then set on the Dogs to worry them. Secondly , He caused many, who seem'd Lovers of the Gospel, and Professors of it, to cast it off, and embrace the Vanities of the World; nay, to worship Idols, and Sacrifice to them. Thirdly , He raised up Multitudes to foment most abominable Errors and Heresies in the Church; by which means the Truth suffer'd greatly; and the Tyrant got much ground, and strengthened his Kingdom; which is signified, in part, by that great Flood the Dragon cast out of his Mouth to drown the Woman and her Seed who kept the Commandments of God,  60 and had the Testimony of Jesus Christ. But this was not all; for Apollyon had a greater Design in this Age of the World on foot, that so thereby he might raise the Renown, Honour and Greatness of this Monster of Pollution, which was twofold: One was to introduce Mahomet ; for it was this Villain that compiled the Turkish Alcaron , by which means Millions of Millions have been deceived to this Day; a strange Hodgpodg, ridiculous and flesh-pleasing Religion, if it may be called a Religion . This began about the Year Six Hundred. Secondly , To usher in, and set up, a more Visible, Spiritual or Ecclesiastical State on Earth, than ever he had before since the Beginning of the World; attended with external Glory , and outward Grandeur ; which, in the Apostle's Dayes, he had laid the Foundation of: but till the Sixth Head , or Imperial Power was remov'd, he could not throughly effect, nor establish; (which fell out between Four Hundred, or Five Hundred, Years after Christ: ) And to the end he might accomplish it, Apollyon saw it would be necessary, to get the Hellish Tyrant a Servant, or subtil Man, to do his Work for him; who, in the Scripture , is called the Man of Sin .    [   Of the Rise of the Man of Sin .  ] And though I represent him here as a Servant , yet the Devil resolv'd to make him a Lord ; yea, a Lord of Lords ; nay, no less than a God ; and to exalt him far above all that are called Gods ; yea, above the God of Gods: and to set him in the Temple, viz. the Church , to shew himself to be God, i.e. to assume that to himself, which only belongs to the ever Blessed God . This is he, who hath been brought in after the Working of Satan, with all Power, Signs, and Lying Wonders ;  61 and with all Deceiveableness of Unrighteousness in them that perish ,  &c. This is he, whom they call Head and Husband of the Church ; the Vicar of Christ over the whole World; God's Vicegerent; Peter's Successor ; the Head and Center of Unity: But, in Scripture , called Anti-Christ ; the Man of Sin , the Son of Perdition ; the Beast that came out of the Earth with Two Horns, like a Lamb, but a Voice like a Dragon ; the False Prophet ; the Idle Shepherd , and Evil Servant: and indeed, the only Universal Head of this False Church , or Ecclesiastical State , that Apollyon hath introduced, or set up, by the means of Tyrant Sin , in the World; to deceive, ruine, and destroy the Souls of Men. Now Peccatum begun to brandish his Victorious Sword , and vaunt himself in his Diabolical Sovereignty . If you are for Religion , or will be Religious , you shall have one that shall suit your Sensual Appetites , and will agree with your Worldly Interest: For when Apollyon saw, that the inward Life, Power and Efficacy of the Christian Religion , was generally gone; and yet the People affected the Name of Christ ; and would not be satisfy'd, without some Way, Modes, or Manner of Worship ; then he began to erect this Form, this Image of Christianity , or set up Counterfeit Godlyness: And since Men did not know what belong'd to the inward Beauty and Glory of Grace , and True Godliness , he was resolved to make it up in an Outward and External Manner; that it might appear amiable to all such, that had no more than Fleshly Eyes to see with. And, now, Tyrant Sin , roared like a mighty, and over-grown, Monster ; and sent out his Bulls , threatning to destroy, and devour all, who would not worship the Beast , and his Image , or receive his Mark in their Fore- heads: nay, in good Earnest, those who would not sacrifice their Reason, Conscience and Religion to the Lust and Ambition of this Tyrant , and adore his Gold-Image , were not to be suffer'd to Buy, Trade, nor Sell, nor indeed to Live: and therefore, he devis'd, by the Help of Apollyon , all sorts of cruel Tortures, and Torments, to be inflicted on all manner of People, both Young and Old, High and Low, Rich and Poor, Bond and Free; who refus'd to worship Gods of Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron ; nay, and a Strange Idol , he had made of a Wafer-Cake . By which means, this Tyrant Murder'd many Thousands, if not Millions of Thousands, of the poor, innocent Saints , and Servants of God , in such sort, that every Street of the Great City Babylon , (which this Monster had built, for Apollyon his Master, to Reign in) became like a meer Shambles , to quarter out the Limbs of Men, Women and Children , Ten, Twenty, Thirty, Forty, an Hundred, nay, Two Hundred Thousand Souls have been Sacrificed at one time; I mean, before they did give over: as witness the Irish Massacre ,  &c. Some he caused to be Burned , some to be Roasted alive , some their Skins flead off , others Hanged by the Hair of their Heads; Poysoning, Starving, Drowning , and any other kind of Death Apollyon could devise; were the poor Saints , and Lovers of True Godliness , put to by this Cursed Traveller , and Tyrannical Monster of Pollution . But, since we have brought him down, very near, to the Dayes wherein we Live; and also, here he is still upon his Progress , wandering up and down in as eager Pursuit of his Hellish Enterprize , as ever: Let us now give over, and treat of his Present Travels in This, and other Nations.  Shewing how Peccatum , alias, Tyrant Sin , came into a Country called Non-Age: And of the strange Projects he play'd there.  Latter Times; 'tis very necessary, to give you some Account of his Present Travels ; and shew what Progress he makes among the People of this Generation: And that we may do it the better, we shall begin with his entring into a great, though weak, Country, called Non-Age ; (he having Intelligence from Apollyon , that a great number of feeble People, of a small Stature, were Two or Three Years ago, by common Fate, though through much Difficulty, come into this Kingdom ; and, for a short time, were to abide in the said Country ; he was resolv'd to visit them:) But the Prince of Darkness , understanding that this Enterprize was of great Importance, and might tend very much, if well managed, to the Increasing, Strengthening and Enlarging of his Kingdom ; or, otherwise, prove to the great Hurt and Detriment thereof; first called a Council in Hell , to advise what was fittest to be done, at this Juncture: And having held their Treacherous Consultations , and come to Agreement; Apollyon , with winged Speed prepares to Peccatum , alias, Sin , to suggest, by secret Injections to him, what was agreed upon; and to instruct him, how to proceed and manage his Affairs in the Country of Non-Age ,  &c. whom he address'd himself to, after this manner: My most Dear, and Mighty, Peccatum , ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ Sin.  ] the great Lord and Conqueror of the World, and Maul of all Mortals ; the Envy of Heaven , and Chief Darling of Hell ; Seeing thou hast been alwayes true to our Interest; and hast rais'd up our Kingdom , above all Kingdoms of the Earth; and made my Glory, Fame , and Grandeur , to spread abroad, far and near. I have some few Instructions , to impart to thee, of great Importance, upon thy Entring into this Country ; to the end thou may'st prepare, or make ready a great People, for my Service, and to fight under my Banner: For those which now I send thee to, thou must Train up from the Cradle , (as my great Servant, and beloved Emperor, Mahomet , doth his Jannizaries ) that they may be well Instructed in our Politicks , and skilful in all Stratagems of War against God, Christ , and True Godliness ; with all this Retinue. This is the Time for thee to work; and the best Age of Mankind, to work upon: 'Tis good to sow our Seed timely; and to take Possession, before we are subplanted by our Enemy: for it is easier to prevent a Disease , than to cure it; or to keep an Adversary out, than when he is in, to get rid of him. And one thing, to my Joy, I will tell thee between thee and I; A long time ago, before any of this Army entred into these Parts, thou, in a good measure, didst their Business for them; for as they come into these Regions , they bring with them Trophies of thy Conquest over them: For thou didst, indeed, originally season,    [   The horrid Nature of Original Sin .  ] and leaven, their Natures for me in such sort, that they all declare, as one Man, whose Side they resolve to take, and under whose Banner they are inclined to fight. Yet, nevertheless, there is much Work for us to do; lest, in their tender Age , by means of that they call Godly Education ,    [   The Devil fears the Godly Education of Children.  ] their Hearts secretly should be drawn away from us, or prepared to receive contrary Seed , (to the overpowering of that Leaven thou hast infused into their Natures) by seasoning their Hearts with Grace , or such Principles , that will prove very destructive to our Interest . Therefore, to prevent all the Danger that may arise, thou must choose Tutors for all this Young and Hopeful Progeny ; or have a great Hand in the Education of them: which if we can work about, we shall do our Business effectually: Neither is there any ground to question the Accomplishment hereof, if thou takest these Directions , and rare Prescriptions , devised and forged for thee. But, considering the divers Ranks, Degrees, Qualities, Descent , or Pedigree of them, thou must find out suitable Tutors accordingly; but all of thine own Off-spring , I beseech thee. First , Therefore, thou must engage Mrs. Ignorance , who has lost her Eyesight, to be Tutor to some of them. Secondly , Mrs. Pride. Thirdly , Mrs. Wanton. Fourthly , Mrs. Stubborn. Fifthly , Mrs. Self-Will. Sixthly , Also One, whose Name is Indulgence , alias, Fond-Love. Seventhly , And Mrs. Misbelief , sometimes called False-Faith. Lastly , Mrs. Hategood ; one of my good Benefactors, who will prove very serviceable in our present Enterprize . Now, no sooner had Peccatum receiv'd his Instructions ; but he hasted away, as on Eagle's Wings,    [   The whole Country of Non-Age invaded by Sin .  ] and suddenly Invaded the whole Country of Non-Age . And to the end he might fully effect this Hellish Intreague , he was resolved to work Matters so about, that a great Part of the Weak and Feeble Inhabitants , might be Tutor'd by Mrs. Ignorance ; to whom Apollyon directed his Speech after this sort: Apoll. My dear Cousin , and very good Friend ; I have a great number of pritty Boys , and Girles , for you to Tutor , and bring up for me, in the Country of Non-Age: Will you undertake the Charge? Ignor. Most Dread and Mighty Apollyon! You know, I never yet declined any Drudgery for you, which lay in my Power: My Lord, I am ready to obey you. Apoll. I assure you, Madam , I kindly accept of all your former and latter Services; and cannot but acknowledge, you have done strange Things for the Advancement of my Kingdom , and greatning of my Power in the World. And now, Noble Peccatum , this Gentlewoman, Madam Ignorance , is your Child , your Natural Off-spring , your own Flesh and Blood ; nay, a Limb or Member of your Body: Therefore, I charge you, to help and assist her in this great Work ; for I should be glad, if she had the Education of all the Children in the whole World; I have such a Veneration for her. Peccatum , upon this, immediately laid about him; and, indeed, wonderfully succeeded in this his first Attempt, by the help of the Prince of Darkness: insomuch,    [   Ignorance the Tutor of many in Non-Age .  ] that abundance of those poor Souls, whereof none were above the Age of Twelve or Fourteen Years, were trained up in Gross Ignorance , and Blindness of Mind ; understanding little or nothing of God, Christ , the Gospel ; no, nor of their own woful State and Condition (which this Bloody Monster , and Hellish Tyrant , both formerly and latterly had brought them into) which he effected many wayes.    [   How Ignorance prevails in Non-Age .  ] First , By keeping their Parents, and such who were to instruct them, under the Power of Sottish Ignorance ; so that, they, who should be as Eyes to the Blind , and Feet to the Lame , had no Eyes to see, nor Feet to go themselves. Secondly , He presented to many Parents, the great Charge of putting their Off-spring to School ; perswading them (they being poor, and low, in the World) they could not be at the cost, though they bestowed a great deal more needlessly upon cloathing and feeding of them; than their Learning would have come to. Now, the reason why the Enemy is so greatly set against Learning , is this, viz. Lest by their attaining to the Knowledge of Letters , they should take to read the Holy Bible , which he dreads exceedingly; because when understood, it vanquisheth (at once) his Darling Ignorance . Thirdly , He endeavours to prevent their learning any Pious and Orthodox Book ; that is wholly taken out of, and grounded upon the Authority of the Holy Scripture . Fourthly , By hindring them, as much as possible, from discoursing, or asking questions about God, Christ , and Religion ,  &c. Also, by causing Parents to be careless about, or rather against, their going to the Church , where the Word of God is truly, and powerfully Preached, and the Sacraments duly and truly Administred. Fifthly , By taking off the Childrens Hearts from any thing that concerns their Souls, or a Future State, by filling their Heads with the Vanities, Toyes, and Trifles, of a Child-hoods State . Sixthly , By presenting to Parents (who understand more than they intend to practice) the Knowledge of God a dangerous thing; and that they, who are most Spiritually Wise, were like to be most Miserable in the World. Seventhly , By perswading some, that the Matters of God , and Religion , only belonged to Ministers, & c. and that others should only mind their Trades, & c. as if the Trade, or Calling, of Godliness , did not belong to all Parents , and Children , to endeavour to learn and understand; it being the main Business, that all Mortals were sent into this World, to practice and follow.    [   Evil Examples a great means to corrupt Children.  ] Eighthly , By presenting the Example of all generally, within Doors and without, abroad and at home, their eyes; and there being little or nothing minded (as the poor Children could see by any, either Parents or Companions ) of a Sublime or Heavenly Nature: But contrariwise, the evil Motions and Lusts of this Tyrant , was wholly followed; who having subdued the Strong, or conquered the Chivalry, (by the powerful hand of his Darling Ignorance ) might, and doth hereby, easily invade and overcome the poor and feeble Infantry; and that, partly, by the means of that evil Example they have continually before their Eyes. Ninthly , By tempting them (and others, much older than they) to conclude, that they shall have Time and Opportunity hereafter, and better Advantages to learn those great things; which, the Enemy tells them, are too high and sublime for their tender Age to pry into, understand, or make Judgment of. And thus the Devilish Tyrant keeps some, nay a great part of the poor Inhabitants of the Country, or Town, of Non-Age , wholly Ignorant of those Things which chiefly concerns them, and in their Child-hood-State ought to look after; lest Satan by fortifying himself, or taking possession so early in their Hearts, makes them afterwards, with much Ease, to become his meer Slaves and Vassals . And sad it is, to see what work Sin makes on little Ones; for when they should be at Prayer, they are at Play; and when a hearing of God's Word, asleep; or else their Minds and Thoughts are exercised about a Thousand Things; not thinking, in the least, that what the Minister saith concerns them; or that they ought to understand, as far as possible, what he speaks. Tenthly , and lastly: Apollyon , and his Off-spring, Tyrant Sin , keeps them in Ignorance; by causing many of them to be Trained up under a Blind, Erroneous and Soul-deceiving Ministry. But, Alas! Sin hath not only this blind Tutor, to instruct the poor beguiled Progeny ; but another, as bad as she (and as you heard of Apollyon's own choosing too) viz. Mrs. Pride ; to whom he also gave Instructions of a pernicious Nature; whereby some Thousands of them are wholly overcome, brought under the Power of this Monster , and undone for ever. This Gentlewoman , it seems, is the Natural Off-spring of Lucifer ; and doth not a little resemble him: And sad it is. That any Little Ones ,    [   How Pride prevails.  ] of humane Race, should be brought up, and tutor'd by her; she being one, that the Lord greatly hateth; and will destroy, at last,  62 all such who give themselves up to learn of her. Now the way that Peccatum takes to effect his Design, by this Hellish Incendiary , is, First , To stir up poor Little Ones , according as he finds their Inclinations, before Ten Years are gone over their Heads, to delight in fine Cloaths, and get into the newest Fashion; though never so Foolish and Antick. And, Secondly , By slie Suggestions to allure their Parents, to please their Children, and feed their Natural (though unlawful and pernicious) Appetites herein: And that they may fully declare they are the real Slaves to Lucifer , and this his Darling , they betimes send their Little Daughters to School, to learn to Dance as Herodias did; and to teach them the rare Art of Naked Breasts and Shoulders, Antick and Fantastick Garbs, Spottings, Patchings and Paintings, Towers, Bulls, Shades, Curlings and Crispings , and other Curiosities of Hell's devising; as to deck their Fingers with Rings , their Ears with Jewels , and their Necks with rich Bracelets or Neck-laces of Gold and Pearl ; whereby they seem rather like little Morrice-Dancers , than the Young Off-spring of Christian People. And thus, being bravely drest up, and the Sparks of Pride kindled in them, they go with stretch'd-out Necks , and haughty Hearts ; that, in a short time, they are too high and proud to know (almost) any Body; and no marvel, when they were never taught to know themselves. And then,   [   How Mrs. Wanton is let in to be a Tutor, in the Country of Non-Age .  ] presently, upon this, in comes Madam Wanton , to teach them other rare Inventions; viz. How to make Set-Faces , to Cringe Alamode de France , the sober Smile, the quaintest Dialect; to humour Discourse well, to get Rowling Eyes , and cast Amorous Glances , to read Love Romances , and frequent Play-houses ; and also, to provide store of rare, though obscene, Draughts or Pictures, decored with all sorts of Allurements for the better Execution of after Actions, and the secret Discharge of Venus Lascivious Misteries , painted with the true Colours of Ovid's Works ; as the Disguising of Naked Gods , and Venus dallying with Adonis, Tarquin at Strife with Lucretia, Hero sporting with Leander ; and such like wanton Objects; with pretty Conceits to encourage the Unwilling, and warm the cold Humour of their raw Age. And thus Apollyon , through Pride , and Ignorance , prepar'd many of the feeble Folks of the Country of Non-Age , as fit Persons to inhabit in the great City Sensuality ; whether, I hear, Peccatum intends to Travel ; and where he has already erected his Throne , and keeps Court. But to proceed: Mrs. Indulgence , alias, Fond-Love , as it appears, hath her Charge and Instructions from the Prince of Darkness , to Tutor divers of them: And this Tyrant Sin effects it through great Subtilty, by infusing the base Seed into their Parents Hearts : Of which those two Varlets,    [ How Mrs. Indulgence and Fond-love are Gender'd; their Nature and Quality. ] Indulgence and Fond-love were Gender'd; who are both had in high Esteem amongst the Hellish Fiends of the Infernal Lake , for their Work sake, and destructive Nature to these poor Creatures; who are Tutor'd by them. They are of such a meek, loving and forbearing Disposition, forsooth, that those Parents , in whom they bear sway, are taught to Indulge their Children in all manner of Vices, and evil Courses. Such dear and tender Love (or rather Hatred) they have towards their poor Off-spring, that great Faults, and filthy Enormities are wink'd and conniv'd at. O they must not be struck, nor hardly frown'd on, by any means; lest discouraged, and made Moams of: Besides should they whip, or severely chastise them, and they die soon after, how would it wound their Conscience? ('Tis no matter what becomes of their Souls) They are not troubled about such Matters: Their great Care, is to see they are well fed (though it be like Lambs for the Slaughter) and bravely cloathed, and cocker'd up in those wayes they naturally love. And though they should Lie, Curse, Swear, or break the Lord's Day , and play when they should attend upon God's Word, or read the Holy Bible ; it must, with a gentle reproof, or none at all, be pass'd by; remembring, when they were at their Age, they did the like themselves. The fond Father dares not tell the Child's fault to the Mother , if she has any Brains; nor the fond Mother the Father , lest he be angry; and to save his Childs Soul from Hell , tends his Head to the Wall; or rather with Discretion, wisely chastiseth him with a smarting Rod, till the Blood comes. Alas! These seem to me, to be the worst Tutors of all; ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 63 because they lay in Fuel for every hurtful and devouring Fire; or promp on, and nourish every cursed and hateful Vice; and so open'd a Door for whole Legions of Devils to enter together, and make miserable Slaughter of the poor, undone Progeny . These bring the Parents to Shame, the Family to Beggary, the Child to the Gallows, and his Soul to Hell. Have not some, nay many, cryed out at Tyburn against their Parents , for their Indulging them in their Sins, and cockering them up in Evil wayes, to this Effect.  Alas 'tis so; and hither I am come: Here must I dye. Ah! 'tis a shameful Doom! But now, the Cause of this my fatal Woe,   [   Mrs. Indulgence and Fond- love , bring Youth to the Gallows.  ] Saith the poor Wretch, I will declare to you: My Father me indulg'd, my Mother more, When but a Child; this open'd to Sin a Door. When I was pack't to School, Order was sent My Master must forbear all Punishment: This made me Proud, Haughty, and Lazy too; And shunn'd no Evils, nor vile Pranks to do. My Mother she with Money me supply'd; And nothing would with-hold, if once I cry'd. When I to Prentice went, and well deserv'd Severe Correction from those which I serv'd; If I did to my Mother but complain, She with her Coin made all things up again. On the Lord's-day , when I should be at Prayer, I hence took Courage, rambling here and there. Whole Nights in Revelling, I oft have past; Whereby my Master's Goods, & Time, did waste. This to bad Company did me commend; Which quickly brought me to this shameful End. Nay,   [   Lying , the more immediate Off-spring of Indulgence and Fond- love .  ] These two Bloody Monsters, Indulgence and Fond-Love , let in another destructive Tutor ; who taught them to Lie, Dissemble, and Equivocate: So that, in a short Time, there was no believing, hardly, a Word the poor Children spoke. For, having told Two or Three notorious Lies, and escaped with a little Chiding, without Correction; they grew very impudent and vile, not caring what they said, to excuse themselves, when taken in other Faults. And not only Hate-Truth , but Mrs. Stubborn , and Self-Will also, by this very means, came to be their Tutors , also, to help Apollyon (the sooner) to make a perfect Conquest over them; and gave Peccatum full Possession: For hereby, they became very Stubborn and Rebellious; contradicting their Parents ; making Mouths at them; not regarding what they commanded them to do, unless in a good Mood; but would pout and be sullen, or else crossly answer again, and strive to have the last Word. And thus, by the Temptations of Sin , together with the Natural Evil Disposition of their own Hearts, and Assistance of these cursed Tutors , [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Apollyon puts the poor and baser sort of the Inhabitants of Non-age to be Tutor'd by Light-fingers .   ] Apollyon gave them Wings to fly whither soever their unbounded, stubborn, and self- pleasing Wills led them; till they became fit Inhabitants for the City Sensuality . But Apollyon , seeing many of the Young Progeny , in the Country of Non- Age , were of a base, poor, and ignoble Race and Pedigree; their Parents not knowing well how to live themselves, without Pilfering and Stealing; Mrs. Light-Fingers was let in; who became Tutor to this sort, and some others also, who were sent to her from Pride, Wanton, Indulgence , and Fond-Love ; whom she taught the rare Art of Thievery. First , How to rob Orchards; to pull Quills out of the Wings of poor Geese ; to milk Cowes ,  &c. And then, for Poultry ; to rob Hen-roosts; and to do it neatly, that their keckling might not Alarm the rest: And, afterwards, when they become good Proficients in their Alphabet, they learn'd harder Lessons; viz. How to rob their Parents, Masters , and Mistresses ; and, at last, the curious Art of Cheating and Picking of Pockets , yea, and Locks too: And, to the end they might perform this with the more Dexterity, they were quickly brought acquainted with the chief Masters of that Society ; and learn'd the Canting Names , used by the whole Corporation of Thieves and Beggars ; as Mumpers, Milkins, Pads , and Room-Padders, Clapperdogeons, Bulk and File ,  &c. Now these being little of Stature, were useful to the Company; because they could get in at Windows, and at other Places, where the Older Thieves could not enter: and also, because of their tender Age they were not suspected; or, if taken, were liked upon that account, to have more pity shewed them. So that, having great Encouragement, in a little time, they became perfect Masters of their Hellish Craft ;    [   A dangerous thing for Parents to be guilty of Heresie , or to hold corrupt Principles, in respect of their Children.  ] and thereby quite overcome by this Bloody Tyrant Sin . The last Tutor Apollyon chooses for the young Progeny , in the State or Country of Non-Age , is his Beloved (though Erroneous and Blasphemous) Daughter, Mis-belief , alias False-Faith : and indeed they are not a few of them, that are Educated by her: for by reason their Parents were utterly drawn aside from the true Orthodox and Apostolical Faith , or Antient Religion , and led into the By-wayes of Schism, Heresie , and Error , their poor Off-spring were trained up in the same Destructive and pernicious Wayes: So that, they hardly held, or were established, in one Fundamental Principle of the True Religion ; by which means, they became Papists, Atheists, Ranters, Arrians, Socinians, Quakers, Shakers, Muggletonians , and the Lord knows what. Thus, and by divers other Wayes and Subtile Devices, doth Apollyon and Sin invade, with their mighty Force and Militia of Hell , the Poor, Weak and Feeble Inhabitants of the Country of Non-age ; till, at last, they come generally under the Education and Tutoring of Mrs. Hate-Good ; who teaches them all her Hellish Mysteries ; as to contemn all Godly Councel and Instructions ; nay, and to scoff, reproach, and jeer all that are truly Religious ; and not only to deride, and flout at them; but to loll out their Tongues, and point at them; and also to make and sing prophane and filthy Songs of them. But by the Providence of God , Two Gentlewomen of good Parentage, were cast in amongst them; One, called Civility ; and the Other, Modesty ; both of the Town of Morality , who took the Charge and Care of Tutoring some few of them; who brought them up under very good Discipline, according to their Light and Knowledge. But these I hear too, when they came into Youth-shire , were utterly corrupted, spoiled and overcome by the Power and Policy of this Bloody Monster . Yet, as God would have it, there was a few Honourable, and High-born Ladies ; who were sent on purpose, by the Prince of Light , and his Off- spring True Godliness , to Tutor some few of this young Progeny ; or else the Tyrant had made a perfect and compleat Conquest of them All. Their Names were these; viz. Lady Christiana . --- Lady True Zeal .    [   Some good Tutors in the Country of Non-Age . ] Lady Love-Truth . Lady Grace , with her Three Daughters, Faith, Hope , and Charity . Lady Wisdom . Lady God-Fear . Lady Hate-Devil . Lady New-Man . But Peccatum had got Tutors for most of them so soon; and so corrupted them, that they were gone out of the Country or State of Non-Age ; and had took up Arms for Apollyon , before these Good and Virtuous Ladies came: Yet a few were instructed by them, and Train'd up for Jesus , the Prince of Light ; in such sort, that they, in their Tender Age, clearly worsted and vanquished this Hellish Tyrant , and all the Powers of Darkness . It would indeed do ones Heart good to see these Mighty Champions routed, and forc'd to fly, by the hands of such young and feeble Soldiers of Jesus Christ ; but what can't Grace and Christianity do? I think it may not be amiss here, to give you two or three Instances of some few of them: One Mary Warren , Born in May 1651, Aged ten Years, had a blessed Work of Grace began upon her, and gave clear Evidence of a Victory she had got over Sin and Satan . Some ask'd her, whether she was willing to die? [   How wonderfully Grace hath prevailed against Sin in some very Young Children.  ] She reply'd; Ay, very willing, for then I shall sin no more: For I know that Christ's Blood hath made Satisfaction for my Sins, &c. At another time in her Sickness, She said , That Satan stood at her left side, and God was on her right, and opened the Gates of Heaven for her; and Satan (saith she) shall not hurt me, though he sought to Devour me, like a Roaring Lion; whether I live or die, it will be well with me; God is satisfied through his Son Jesus Christ , for he hath wash'd my Sins away with his Blood; or to that effect. At another time she said , Tho' the Lord is pleased to let me lie under many Pains.--- Yet will I wait upon Him; for He is my Stay, and the Hope of my Salvation : My pains are nothing to the pains of Hell, which will never end: And Christ he suffered a great deal more for me, than all this is; He was Bruised, Buffetted, and Spit upon, and they Plated a Crown of Thorns, and put upon his Head, and gave him Vinegar to Drink (But I have several things to take, though I cannot relish them.) They came out against Christ , with Swords and Staves, and he did not open his Mouth against them, but rebuked Peter , for cutting off the High-Priest's Servants Ear, and bid him, Put up his Sword into his Scabbard (and said) Shall I not drink of the Cup, my Father hath prepared for me?  &c. Though my Pains are very great, yet I am full of Joy and Comfort; I was full of Comfort before; but I am fuller of Joy this Hour, than I have been yet: It is better to live Lazarus's Life, and to die Lazarus's Death, than to live Dives's Life; he had his Delicates, and afterwards would have been glad, to have had Lazarus dip his Finger in a little Water, and cool his Tongue. Though the Lord gives Satan Power over my Body, yet he hath promised he shall not hurt my Soul. (The Devils could not go into the Herd of Swine , till Christ had given them leave.) And though he stood at my left Hand, and said, I was in filthy Rags; yet the Lord stands at my right Hand, and saith, 64 I am as a Brand plucked out of the Fire, and he will put on me his Robes of Righteousness . Another Child, about Eleven Years Old, as she was praying to this Effect ; That she might not look for any thing to rest on, or trust upon for Justification , whereby, to stand Righteous before God , but only in Jesus Christ alone, who dyed for her at Jerusalem, and rose again the Third Day for her Justification . Lo!   [   This is Recorded by Mr. Jeffey .  ] How wonderfully the Lord , and his Hand-maid Grace , help'd her; for when Prayer was ended, She told her Father, now I believe in Christ, and am not afraid of Death . Behold Faith in a Babe, makes Apollyon and the Tyrant fly. I have also received an Account of another poor Child, that went a begging from door to door; who lived in the Parish of Newington-Butts : The Boy was a very Monster of Wickedness (saith my Author) for he would call filthy Names, Curse and Swear, & c . Yet a gracious man, out of pity took him as his own, and put him to be Educated by Mrs. Christiana ; and it is wonderful to hear, what power that poor Child got over Sin and his Master Apollyon ; for in a little time she taught him to pray fervently, and to seek after the Knowledge of Jesus Christ : And he proved so good a Proficient, that he, with much abhorrence, cry'd out of himself, not only for his Swearing, Lying , and other evil Vices , he had been guilty of, but also was in great horror for the Sin of his Nature, and Vileness of his Heart, and Original Corruption. And he did not only pray much himself, with strong Cries and Tears, but begged the Prayers of others for him, whom he knew feared the Lord . And at last (tho' fill'd full of doubts, about his Eternal Estate) he came to take a little hold of that Promise,  65 Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest . But O! How did this poor Boy, admire and bless God, for the least hopes, & c. And at last came to great satisfaction of his Interest in Christ , and Victory over his cursed Enemies, Sin and Satan ; and remained in a holy and pious Frame, being filled with inward Joy, until he died. Moreover, I could give you a certain Account, of two or three more, that were in their Non-Age perfect Conquerors over the Powers of Darkness , and not above three or four years Old; but because some are not easily brought to believe such things, I will say no more. Yet, notwithstanding, some few of this poor Progeny , in the State or Country of Non-Age ; were thus enabled by good Education, and the Grace of God , to vanquish this Bloody Enemy . Yet, Oh! what fearful Slaughter and Spoil, did he make of the rest, Raging, Raving and Roaring about,  66 like a hungry and greedy Lyon; Rending, and Taring them in pieces, not shewing any pity; nor in the lest regarding their Tender Age. So that in every Town and City, may be seen, the sad Examples, of his Conquest and Merciless Cruelty; by their Ignorance, Pride, Lying, Swearing, Stubbornness, Rebellion , and all other Evil Habits, Sin has infused into poor Children. So that we may say, with sorrowful Hearts, the Country of Non-Age is subdued, and brought under the Power, and Kingdom, of the Prince of Darkness : Most Parents bringing up Children, to enlarge his Territories .  O Vile, and cursed Monster! will't not spare The poor and little Babes, who newly are Arriv'd into these dismal Shades of Night? Must they first be the Prey of Hellish spite? What never satisfied? Is this thy Rage, Destroy whole Millions, in their Tender Age? Look to't you Parents, who these Stories hear; And let your Souls dissolve into a Tear, That bring up Children for the Hellish Fiend; And never seek their Souls for to defend From Sin , which will destroy 'em in the end.  Shewing how Tyrant-Sin , in his Progress , Travell'd into Youth-shire ; and of the fearful Conquest and Slaughter he made there.  cruel and Bloodthirsty-Tyrant , that delights in nothing but Rapine and Murder , he greedily follows his Prey; and therefore with great speed, and no less fury ( Apollyon being enraged at the loss he sustained, in not having made a perfect Conquest in the said Country) but contrariwise basely worsted by a few weak, contemptible Soldiers. He in the next place came into, and invades the whole County of Youth-shire ; where dwells abundance of brave Lads and Lasses ; some of which had cruel Marks on them of his former Conquest, when they remained in the Country of Non Age : but by reason of those Reverend and Grave Matrons , before mentioned, divers of them being in this, as well as in those Regions, he was afraid of being subplanted; and therefore resolv'd not to lose those by negligence, that he had beguil'd and overcome by Craft and Subtilty: nor was he quite without hopes of regaining some of them in Youth-shire , which he lost in the Country aforesaid: and observing many of the Inhabitants together, and perceiving their natural Inclinations;    [ How Sin salutes Youth , and prevails upon them.  ] (by the Instructions received) he salutes them after this manner: Gentlemen , and you young Ladies , are you willing to entertain a Traveller and walk a little way with me? Upon this they all seemed, at first, to make a pause, till one (whose wanton looks betrayed the Inclinations of his Heart) answered, Sir, what are you? Peccatum .    [  Siu. ] Sir, I will assure you, no Enemy to those youthful and vernal Joyes, Delights and Pleasures which your sweet and sprightful Nature is so much set upon; but I am he whom you need, or stand in great want of, in order to the greatning, raising and encreasing of your transcendent Felicity in this World, or making your Lives comfortable to you; for divers of you (I perceive) look sad and dejectedly, as if something troubled your hearts, which I will teach you to cast at your heels. If any of you will be Fools, and spend your dayes in sadness, who can help it? there is no need of it if you will believe me:   [   Thousands believe Sin and the Devil , before they will believe God .  ] and I will assure you Gentlemen, Millions in the World have, and still do, before such who talk of strange Joyes and Delights God knows where; which are only fond Conceits of melancholly Coxcombs; who prate of things they never saw, and flatter themselves with a Crown, forsooth, of inconceivable Glory , that no mortal Creature (by their own Confession) ever enjoyed: Those things are Fancies; besides suit not with your Natures; nor are they now (I mean) presently to be had: if you will embrace me, and make me your Friend and Bosom-companion, there's nothing well which your Hearts can desire but you shall have it: you that are for Riches shall have them;  67 I will teach you rare devices to catch them; though 'tis said, They make themselves Wings and flye away ; yet I can tell you how to clip their Wings, or if they ride, like a St. George on Horseback , their Legs too rather than fail, and bring them with vengeance into your Coffers : So that you that are Gentlemen of mean Fortune, shall have no cause to fear of wanting Money to spend at Taverns , at Games and Whore-houses , for I am no Enemy to such fine Delights they afford those of your Age and Complexion. For you that are for Pleasures shall have your fill; my Revels are open'd, to Chambering, Dancing and Wantonness, Dice, Cards and Chickers ; and all manner of Night-sports , as Kissing, Toying and Courting, Hawking and Hunting , or whatsoever your Flesh best approves of: Gentlemen, you are welcome. You that are for Honour, and would leave your Names famous to Posterity, I will teach you the ready way to attain it: Who was it raised the Renown of Nebuchadnezzar, Herod the Great, the Glorious C aesar , and Mighty Mahomet? did not I? If you be for Temporal Grandieur, 'tis I must mount you; and if for Spiritual Premotion, I can fit you:  68 For who caus'd Diotrephes to love Pre-eminence, and set the Triple Crown on Peter's Successor, but my self? If you are not willing, without advice, to embrace me, go to able Counsel; or would you have Examples, I have both ready. For Counsellors; go to Mr. Carnal Reason, Flesh and Blood ,  &c. whose Judgments are grave and solid, safe and harmless; if it was not so do you think so many Thousands, and them of all sorts, and some of the wisest, would so readily receive it? Ask your five Senses, and they will tell you, ye have enough to advise with: And then, for Example, they are innumerable; but be sure, do not mistake me; I include not Joseph, Moses, Obadiah, David, Daniel, John nor Timothy , whom I hope you will not be such Fools to follow: But not to keep you in the dark; there is all the old World, and the greatest part of this, whom if you imitate, I need proceed no further: If the Example of mighty Emperors, famous Heroes, and many Noble Ones of the Earth, with the greatest part of the Residue of Mankind will not affect you; then let the Pattern of some of your Parents and Progenitors be your Copy; nay, and call to mind your own experience: have you not already had a Taste of my Dainties? do they not please your curious Palates? do I offer things unpleasant enough? all the wayes I'll lead in, are strew'd with Roses , and perfum'd with Myrrh, 69 Frankincense, Alloes and Cinamon , what say you Sirs? Upon this, smiling one upon the other, One quickly broke silence, and spoke to this purpose; Faith Lads , this seems a brave ,    [   Fools make a Mock at Sin .  ] jolly Fellow , he'll make mirth for us, and be a fit Companion for such gallant Youngsters as we: Come let's embrace him, and close with these Suggestions: Let's lay the Reins loose upon the Neck of our Lusts , and make him to choose our wayes for us. But stay, saith another, I fear he will make us meer Spend-thrifts ; for, I assure you, I love not that wanton fellow Prodigallity ; though he be in high esteem, now adayes, and beloved of many Ladies for his good gifts, and followed by many rich Citizens Sons; who have raised his Grandeur by their Fathers mony, so as to purchase a Charriot for him; yet I have heard it is drawn by four base Horses, viz. Rashness, Luxury, Spend-all and Folly ; his Coach-man being the Devil , and one (whom I hate) called Beggary , rides behind; and though his Charriot runs a thundering pace, and he seems secure; yet there's abundance of Folks, as Merchants ,    [   Some Youngsters, who hate Prodigallity are overcome by Covetousness.  ] Mercers, Drapers, Silk-men and Taylors ;  &c. pursues him with cruel long Bills, so that for his fooling he is like to pay dearly. Apollyon perceiving this Youth's Temper, whisper'd in Peccatums Ear, and said; This Fellow will make a good Niggard . And presently he put the Tyrant into another Habit; who at a convenient time met him, to whom he did impart such rare Stratagems, how to grow rich, and keep that which he had already gotten; which so won the young Muckworm's heart, that he joyfully embrac'd him. What the Counsel was, seemed at first a Secret; but by his after-Carriage and Behaviour it was guess'd at; for he became a sneaking, lean, ill-fac'd, lank- belly'd Rascal , grudging himself every good bit he eat, and fed much upon Bread and Cheese, Red Herrings ,  &c. and oftentimes was seen to go to the Pump to drink his Mornings Draught: and in his Trading he pinch'd every Body in his Weights and Measures; and would not lend nor give a Penny scarcely, though it was to keep his own Father out of a Prison; and in process of time he became a great Usurer; where with his Bags of Gold and Silver we will leave him, and return to the other Company; who seeing which way their Fellow was gone fell all alaughing, and with cursed Oaths, and taunting Expressions, reproached him because he was not for Rioting and Drunkenness, Chambering and Wantonness ; and yet poor Soul as much in the Tyrant's Chains as they: But hark! how they Sing and Carouse it; crying out to this deluding Traytor , we are your servants, Sir; hey Boyes, One and All, One and All ; let us cast away Sorrow , from us, and take our swing of Pleasures ;  70 and to Morrow shall be as this Day, and much more abundant . Stay, said one amongst them, I am taken with a strange trembling; I doubt 'tis an Enemy that thus doth court us; and that the whole Country is invaded; for some Body whispers strange things in my Ears, sad Wars, doubtless, in me are approaching; for I was Educated bp a most Noble, Virtuous and High-born Lady, in the Country of Non-Age , called Civility ; who instructed me to fight against, Vice, Rioting and Wantonness ; and told me of the danger that was like to befall me as I past through this place; I must leave you, though it grieves me; my Conscience , 'tis that gripes me: Hark! (said Love-lust ,    [   How Convictions of Sin are stifled in young Men.  ] one of the jovial Company) what Fool have we here? Conscience! a fanatical Fancie? Why are you troubled? Because said he, I fear this Traveller will debauch us; for I hear his Name is Sin , the bloody Tyrant , who destroyed almost all the Country from whence we came. Apollyon seeing this, whispered one in the Ear, whose Name was Shameless , and said, Discourse with him: I will help thee to Arguments, lest you lose him. Shameless . His Name is Sin , you say; is it an Evil to be merry; to drink a Glass or two of Wine with good Fellows; and court a fair Lady? Does not these things belong to our Age? And is it not the Alamode in all Countries amongst the greatest Gallants ? But if you leave our Company, we will load you with Reproach and Infamy ; that shall be harder for you to bear, than the Name of young Huff , or Spendthrift ; with that a wanton Lass , amongst them, started up, and shamefully abused him, calling him Clown , Goodman Shame-face , and Timorous ,  &c. and another took him about the Neck and kissed him; and with an impudent Face, said unto him, come my Boy, stollen Waters is sweet, 71 and Bread eaten in secret is pleasant ,  &c. I have my deck't Bed for thee with coverings of Tapestry , with Carved Works and fine Linnen of Egypt ; and have perfumed it too with Myrrh, Alloes and Cinamon : Come, go along with me; and let us take our Fills of Love until Morning,  &c. The poor Soul being not able,  72 longer, to resist such powerful Temptations, nor endure their base Reproaches; was overcome by Sin , and straitway followed her; As an Ox goes to the Slaughter, or as a Fool to the Correction of the Stocks, till a Dart struck through his Liver; as a Bird hasteth to the Snare, and knows not it is for his Life . The jolly Company perceiving they had gained the Field, fell into a laughter; Triumphing in such sort, with fearful Damnings and Carrousings , as if the Day was their own; and in a little time they should subdue all under Apollyon's Scepter; so that for a pretty while nothing was heard but Oaths and Blasphemy ; nor dost any gainsay them for fear of being knock'd down or stabb'd; and upon this Peccatum being flush'd with Victory, ravaged all the County of Youth-shire ,    [   Dangerous to reprove some Ungodly Men . ] Town and Family, Male and Female: and those he could not overcome by Pleasure he overcame by Profit; and those that fell not by the Lust of the Flesh fell by the Pride of Life; so that it would even melt a Heart of Stone to see what dissolution was made in every Corner; Lust prevailing and enlarging her Territories; Youth being so generally blinded by the deceit of this Enemy and Impostor, who vauntingly display'd the Flag and Banner of Levity, Luxury and Loosness throughout the whole World; dayly sending Millions out of this and other places to inhabit the great Country of Sensuality : Here you might see the Table of the Drunkard sit now, but will scarce stand without holding anon; do but view with what delight and greediness of Appetite he infuseth and exfuseth, pours out and pours in, empties and fills to the surfeiting of his Body, beggary of his Purse, blotting his Name, and damning his Soul; but since he is casting up his Accounts under the Table, let us be gone lest our Stomacks turn within us; but lo, at the very door of our Exit , see what a sight is here! the Monster hath brought in as Trophies of another Conquest, a Troop of incestuous and libidinous Persons; who consume the Day in contriving of their Lusts, and the Night in performance of the same; who have their Plots and Ambushes, their Circumventious and Deceits to entangle and draw in the Foot of the Innocent; the Possession of their Neighbour, of their Friend, the unpossessed Affinity and Consanguinity,    [   The abominable and beastly Nature of Lusts . ] the Rules of Reason, and the Laws of Nature and Nations, being wholly set aside obliterated and unregarded by them in the, pursuit of their Bestial, Exorbitant and Unbounded Desire. Thus by all manner of Debauchery is the Country of Youth-shire spoiled by this cursed Traveller ; and many Thousands of hopeful young Men, and nice Virgins, made his profess'd Vassals, by being prostrated as a Prey to Lust and Rapine : Alas! how grievous is it to see such Stars of this lower Globe ; and those the most spangled, bright and fulgent above many, as Roses amongst Lillies , or the Quintescence of Beauty obscured, shadowed, eclipsed and utterly stained and darkned, being led to Dishonour , ransacked of the richest Dowrie of Nature, or robbed of that invaluable Jewel (I mean) their Chastitie ; even as a Bee of her Sting , left to bewail their Misery, and to curse those Tongues who drew them in, or beguiled them with their Golden Words, which guilded over those bitter Pills they have swallowed; and must vomit up again by Repentance, or perish for ever. Apollyon , and his Agent, beholding the Victory they had made in Youth- shire ; being fill'd with Triumph, though not having made a perfect Conquest, fell a singing, to allure and secretly o'ercome the rest.  Come, come, brave Gallants , here's a Song that will Ravish each Sense ; your Souls with Laughter fill. Look round about, and try what you can see; All is your own, if you'l bow down to me. Is he not worthy all your love to have, That offers all things, to you, you can or crave? Come then along with me; I'll have you know, The Paths are pleasant in which I do go: No Cross, no Crook, no foul nor dirty waves. You need to fear; why do you make delayes? But lovely Vallyes , Hill'd on every side; Where Meadows ly adorn'd with Nature-Pride ; As Primrose, Cowslip and the Violet ; Nay, Flowers of all sorts most rarely set: Where Birds of every sort do sweetly sing, And warble forth their Notes as in the Spring . Come whiff the Dainties of these fragrant Fields ; And see the Nest the Nightingale builds. If thou but once dost hear this Melody , And give thy Heart to me and Grace defie, Thou wilt commend my Paths and also say For Joy and Pleasures none like this rare way: Deep in the Dark , yet much frequented Place I have wander'd up and down for a long space. And in my Travels have found out the thing Which to most Mortals sweet Content doth bring. So that no Pleasure can allure thy Mind; But here they are for quantity and kind. If Drunkenness's the Thing thou takes delight, Come to my Taverns , drink both Day and Night: Here's one brave Boy , who's Peerless for Renown ; Who drank some scores of mighty Drunkards down. Here's He that lived many a long Year, And hardly tasted Food , but drank strong Beer . Doth Pride allure thee now for to excell; Shake hands with Lucifer , he'll like it well. Every Month thou must thy Fashion change, And for the newest up and down must range. Adorn thy self with all the strange Disguise The proudest can invent under the Skies: And if for Antickness thou dost exceed, Thou'lt be my best and dearest Child indeed. Lay on more cost upon thy self in wast, Than Princes wore not many Ages past: And when you have learn'd perfect this rare Art , Mind well the next which to you I impart: Feed high, be gluttenous ; and every Day Get the best Jellies \---'tis the only way To make Provision for another Play. Lascivious Wantons in whole Swarms you see, Cleave to my Sides like to a Prodigie . Your Venus-sports are lovely in mine Eye, And so indeed is all Debauchery . I do allow each one to get a Bride ; If they'l but get their Concubines beside. For Cards and Dice , and for your Wenches call, For I know how my Lads to please you all. To get the Art of Swearing , pray devize More new Coin'd Oaths ; these are the Youths I prize This is the way; tis here my Journy lies. The Song being ended, Peccatum thought now he should soon get his Regiments full, and so perfect what was wanting in these Parts; in order to a total Conquest: and indeed many Voluntiers dayly Listed themselves to fight under the Prince of Darkness : Some being allur'd by one Bait, and some by another.    [   By reason as God would have it, the Gospel had been preached in the Hearts of some of them  ] But on a sudden, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) the Leaders observ'd one throwing down his Arms, and running away, which caus'd great Combustion: One cry'd knock him down, others stab him; and indeed he was on a sudden, sadly wounded in his Name, being rendred as the vilest Wretch on Earth; but at last one of the jovial Boyes, called Impudence , being stirr'd up by Peccatum , spoke to him to this Effect; Impudence . Friend,    [   One Youth throws down his Arms, and deserts his Company.  ] What is the Cause you desert us, and have thrown down your Arms? Convert . (For that, it seems, was his Name) I am convinced, that the Wayes you go in are evil, and very dangerous; and that this Traveller , whom you have entertain'd, is the King's Enemy ; nay, a most Bloody and Cruel Traytor: And therefore, I am resolv'd to be gone; and obtain a Pardon , if possible, for what is past. Impudence . Sirrah, who is your Tutor? Convert . A very Vertuous Lady, whose Name is Christiana . Impudence . What Lessons hath she learned you? Conv. Very good ones,    [   The choice Lessons Christianity teaches. ] viz. To find more sweetness in leaving of Sin , than ever I found in the committing of it. To leave and loath every Sin , because 'tis so hateful to God, and contrary to his Nature, and Holy Law . To live a Holy Life , and do much good; and to make but little noise of it. To prefer the Duty I owe, above the danger I fear. How to Sacrifice a stout and stubborn Will, for God's Honour , than to do rather vil a Pleasure . To bring up the bottom of my Life, to the top of my Light, and that I should not Sin against my Light, lest I Sin away my Light. To chuse rather to be saved in a rough Sea, than to be drown'd in a calm River. To bear the Cross for Christ , in Suffering, lest I lose the Crown of Christ , by Sinning. Likewise, to chuse rather to be afflicted with Lazarus on Earth, than to be tormented with Dives in Hell. And to leave that Company here, that would bring my Soul to Destruction hereafter. Also to chuse the worst of Sorrow, before the least Sin ; because there is more Evil in that, than there is in the greatest Affliction. To mourn most for those Sins before God , that appear least before Men; for the outward Acts are more Scandalous, yet inward Lusts are more dangerons. Hereby she taught me, to be better inwardly in Substance, than outwardly in Appearance; for those who deceive others, with the false Shews of Holiness, deceive themselves with the false Hopes of Happiness. To desire Grace not only to be saved,   [   See Mr. Seeker's None-such Professor.  ] but also to be Sanctified; and to endeavour to have Sin Crucified, as well as Pardoned; and to be made holy on Earth, as well as happy in Heaven. To undertake all Christian Dutys ; yet wholly to rely upon God's Mercys: or to be much for doing; and yet seek to be saved only, in a way of Believing. To speak well of what God is, and to think well of what God does; and never to complain of the Badness of the Times and Seasons, if I can but get God to be my Portion. To be more in love with the God of the Altar, than with the Gold of che Altar; or to covet as much the God of Mercies, as the Mercies of God . To look more at home than abroad; how 'tis with me, than how 'tis with others; and that the readiest way to know whether or no I am in Christ ; is to know whether Christ is in me; because the Fruit is more visible than the Root. To set out for God in my Beginning, and to hold out with God unto my Ending; and that the best way to have the whole Harvest of our Lives Sanctified by Him, is to have the First of our Lives dedicated to him; who prizes more the Blossoms of Youth , than the Sheddings of Old-Age . To value the Joyes of Heaven, above the Vanities of the Earth. She taught me also to remember,   [   God observes all the Wayes of Men. ] that whatsoever I do on Earth, 'tis eyed by the God of Heaven; and that after all my present Receivings, there will come a time of future Reckonings. Besides that, there is no obtaining what is promised, without doing what is commanded; and that Inward Purity , is the ready way to Eternal Plenty . Moreover, that all the Time that God allows us on Earth, is little enough to do that Work God allots us: And that 'tis my chiefest Business, to make sure of Future Blessedness . Lastly , That I should sow such Seed whilst I live, as I would be glad to eat the Fruit of when I die. Impud. Upon this Impudence swore Damn him , he would tread him, and his Tutor , both under his Feet, if he would not return back. But Apollyon , seeing that Force would do no good, rais'd up another,    [ Satan can't force Men to Sin.  ] whose Name was Self-Conceit , to dispute and reason out the Case with him. Self-Conceit . Brother, What is the Cause you are so strangely alter'd of late, and have forsaken our Company? Convert . Because I see the Way is dangerous, in which you go; you are all blinded, in taking this Traveller, Peccatum , for a Friend: for he secretly designs (I hear) to murder you all. Do you not read in the Bible , what Work Sin has made in the World? Self-Conceit . You mistake your self, and think that is Sin , which is not: Don't think the Golden Cup of Profit, Pleasures , and Honours , are such frightful things? Convert .    [   Sin is sweet in committing; but the end will be bitter. ] Friend, You see the Bait , but not the Hook ; the Golden Cup , but not the Poyson in it: You taste the Sweet of Sin , now, but see not the Bitter Wrath and Misery that follows it. You are like our First Parents , that this Enemy cheated; who took an Apple , in exchange for a Paradise . For my part, I will not any longer play like a silly Fish , with this Angler's Bait . What is the Pleasure of Sin , here, when weighed against the Pain for it hereafter? The Sweet will soon be gone; but the Bitter will last forever. This Enemy is a Deceiver ; whilst he kisses the Lips , he betrays the Soul into the Hands of the Devil . Self-Conceit . Say what you will;    [   How Men hide their Sins.  ] that which you call Pride , is but Neatness . Would you not have Young People to be clean and comely? And that which you call Covetousness , is but Good Husbandry ; and Drunkenness , but Good Fellowship: And what is Wantonness , but a Trick of Youth? Convert . You deserve to be cheated, that seek to put a Vizard, your selves, upon the Thief , that he might not be known, nor taken. Sin is never the whit the less odious, vile, and abominable, because thus bravely drest up in fine and clean Linnen, and curiously Painted. You do but strive to guild over the Poysonous Pills , or put on the Sheep's Cloathing upon the Wolfe's Back. Friend , The foulest Hand may have on it the fairest Glove ; and the richest Robes are, sometimes, put upon the filthiest Bodies . Self-Conceit . Well, Friend , I see you can talk: But, since you are frightned from that Excess that we run to, pray abide with us; and take, now and then, a little Liberty, a Sip or two with us; and don't leave us quite: A little Sin you may commit, without any Danger to your Soul . Convert . The least Sin is a Breach of that Law , that layes You and I, and all the World,  73 under the Wrath and Curse of God . What did Adam's Apple cost him? And what befel him, that gathered Sticks on the Sabbath-day? 74 and Ananias , for telling of a Lie? The least Sin can't be attoned for, without Christ's precious Blood . The smallest Sin is against an Infinite God ; and therefore, deserves an Infinite Punishment . Nay, and let me tell you, Little Sins make way for Greater; neither is there any Sin properly little , in its own Nature: Besides, the smallest Sin , will damn the Soul . And since I have forsaken, by the Grace of God , my great Sins ; I will never lose the Love of God for a Trifle; if it be a little thing, it is the easier left. If I should yield to him, that sets you upon me to do this, or that thing, because 'tis but a small matter; I should, in so doing, shew the greatest Unkindness to Christ imaginable; viz. in wounding and piercing his Heart , and grieving his Spirit , on such slight Occasions. Besides,  75 A little Leven leveneth the whole Lump . And if this Serpent can get in his Tayl , he'll soon get in his Whole Body. God's People have suffer'd great Torments , before they would commit the least Sin . And therefore, tempt me not; for I cannot stand under the Guilt of the least Iniquity. Presumption . Come, Brother, God is made up with Mercy ; though I do think, we may exceed, yet there is no reason for you to be in this Heat: For God is a Gracious and Merciful God ; and ready to pardon us, at any time, when we confess our Sins to Him. You see, God let's us alone in our wayes: He is not so severe, as you suppose. Convert . Sir, God is as Just, as He is Gracious; witness his Casting down the Angels that sinned ; and in turning our First Parents out of Paradise ; and in drowning the Old World . Also, He hath declared, positively, He will not Clear the Guilty ,  76 and impenitent Person , And let me tell you, Mercy and Patience abused, will, at last, turn to Fury . When Mercy is despised, Justice takes the Throne. If God be Gracious, and full of Goodness, shall I sin against Him? Shall I sin because Grace hath abounded? No.  77 I must say with Joseph ,  78 How can I do this thing, and sin against God? Vain-Hope . Friend, Repentance will cure all at last; and that is no hard Work: And therefore, you need not keep such ado, and thus villifie this Jolly Company . Is it such a hard thing to return and confess our Faults, in entertaining him? Alas! 'Tis but to beg Pardon, and cry, Lord have Mercy upon me: And God will quit the Score, and forgive us, no doubt on't. Convert .  79 Is it an easie thing for the Blackamore to change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots , or for Thee to Raise the Dead? You talk vainly, and understand not what Repentance is. What is more difficult, Alas,    [   Repentance, a hard and difficult Work.  ] than Repentance? For, let me tell you, It is a Change, and Converting Act: We must leave Sin ; yea, every Sin ; nay, hate and loath it.    [   What Repentance is.  ] This Tyrant , which you plead for, must be trod down under your Feet, and look't upon (as indeed he is) the most vile and abominable Villain under the Heavens: And is it an easie thing (think you) to have those evil Habits, he has infused into you, changed; so as to love that, which now you hate; and hate that, which now you love. Nay,   [   Repentance not to be deferred.  ] and it must now be set about: Now God calls us to Repent; 'tis not for us to say to Morrow . Are we certain, God will give us Grace hereafter, to leave that Sin , which we now resolve to live in? Remember, how many have cry'd out under the Power and Guilt of Sin ; and yet could find no room for Repentance . That Devil that tells you, 'Tis an easie thing to Repent to Day, will to Morrow assure you, there is no Repentance for you; but you must be Damned, without Remedy. Presumption . But still, for all this, you may venture a little way with us: though you will not go into her Bed. You may sit with us Drunkards , and take a Sip or two, though you will not be Drunk. You may handle the Golden Wedge , though you do not steal it. You may wear Antick Garbs , and not be Proud of them. Come Boy, prithee gang along.--- Convert .  80 Stay, Sir, I am forbid to come near the very Door of the Harlot's House; and to Abstain from all Appearance of Evil .  81 I am taught to Pray, Lead us not into Temptation: And shall I thrust my self into it? Besides, I remember, how many have smarted by this means. Alas my Heart is deceitful; and I dare not trust it upon the Devil's Ground. David said, He had not sate with vain Persons; 82 neither would he go with Dissemblers . And God has given me such Light , and Grace , that your Company is hateful to me. Then another spake, whose Name was Ignorance . Ignor. Sir, God loves us, and hath as great Respect for us, as any in the World though we take the Liberty of Youth: for we have many good things in Possession, above what those have who follow your ways: And if it was a dangerous thing to be led by this Traveller , sure so many Thousands would never be so Blind as to follow him; and some too of Great Name, Wisdom and Learning . Convert . Do you think,    [   Outward Blessings no Sign of God's Favor. ] that God loves the Great Turk , because He hath given him such vast Dominions , and lets him have all manner of outward Glory and Pleasure . Those of Old, who burn'd Incense to the Queen of Heaven , said,  83 Then they had store of all good things, and saw no Evil. Dives had a great Portion of Worldly Blessings: But was that a Sign God loved him? And Lazarus was seemingly Miserable; and was that a Sign God hated him? Think of these things. Do you not see, that Men let their Oxen feed in Fat Pastures? But 'tis to fit them for the Day of Slaughter. God's Wayes are not understood by your shallow Head: He punishes his own Children , Crosses , and Afflictions , here, on their outward Man; and plagues the Ungodly with Spiritual Judgments ; as Hardness of Heart, Unbelief, Blindness of Mind , and with a seared Conscience: And, which is the worst of these, 'Tis better to suffer here, than suffer in Hell . And then to what you said last; Do you not read, The Way is broad ,  84 and the Gate wide, that leads to Destruction, and many (that is, Multitudes) go in thereat . Vain-Hope . Well, for all this, you are but a Fool, to trouble your Head about such Matters so soon; it may be Time enough hereafter, when we are Old, and have sucked in the sweet Profits, Pleasures and Honours of this World . Convert .  85 Sir, Doth not God command us, now in the Days of our Youth, to remember Him: and promise also,  86 that They who seek Him early, shall find Him . 'Tis, Friend , the greatest Madness and Folly in the World, to put off God , and the great Things of Eternity , with May-be's . We are call'd Now ; and shall we say, To Morrow? This is God's Time: And shall it not be Ours? Shall Tyrant Sin have our Best;    [   God will not accept the Dregs of our Dayes.  ] and God put off with the Dregs of our Days? Can we think, He will accept of such hereafter, when they are Old; who resolve to serve the Devil , while they are Young? Is it not, Now , the Time to Sow? What, will you perswade me to defer it to that Time, when we should Reap? Will Tradesmen, or others, neglect their Markets , and Fairs ; and say, They may provide themselves with such and such Commodities , at any time; and yet can't tell, whether or no they may ever have the like Advantages, and Opportunities, to store themselves with such things they need? Sir , How many Thousands hath this Murderer deceiv'd by the spacious Pretence and Promises of Long Life ,    [   Hopes of long Life destroys many.  ] and Late Repentance? Nay, How many Thousands hath he thrown into Hell , who now lie burning in Unquenchable Fire , by this Device? If I neglect this Time, I know not whether I may ever have another. Shall I be led away by a cursed Traytor , and flie in my Sovereign's Face ; with hopes he'll Pardon me hereafter, when he hath made me no such Promise; but, contrariwise, declares positively, If I do so, I shall die,  87 and perish eternally? Fearful . You'll lose, I will assure you, your Friend's Favour, as well as Ours , who have been your sweet Companions . Convert . It's better to please God ,    [   The Love and Favour of God , better than all the World.  ] than Man. If I lose my Earthly Friends , I shall have Heavenly Ones. God is the best Friend, Sir . Is it not better to have the Love of the Prince , than the Love of his Page? Friend , I had rather, a Thousand times, lose your Favour, than the Favour of God and Christ . The Company seeing they could not prevail with him to return, abused him fearfully; calling him at their Pleasure. But one of the Youths , observing that the Convert had clearly worsted them, was mightily wrought upon; and he was resolved to leave them too: Which made Apollyon grind his Teeth , and foam dreadfully. But 'twas all in vain: For God open'd his Eyes , and Mouth , to speak to this purpose: Illuminatus .    [   Another Youth Wrought upon.  ] Good Brother, How did you come to get Power over this cursed Peccatum , and the Prince of Darkness? I am perswaded, you are that Young Man , that I have read of in a little Book, call'd, War with the Devil . Convert . Thou say'st right; I am the very same Person. Illumi. Why then, I understand by that, the Course you took; and, by the Help of God , I will go on in the same way. I perceive, Conscience was a great Friend to you. Convert . Yes; when he was rightly inform'd, or had his Eyes enlightned, by God's Word, he proved useful to me: But he could do nothing to purpose, till the Spirit and Grace of God was infused into my Soul .---Then said Illuminatus , (for that was his Name) I have had great Sorrow upon my Heart for my abominable Sins , since I have read concerning your Conversion . But I cannot believe. Conv. You must cry to God as I did for Faith , and ponder well the Promises of God ; for I am perswaded thou wilt meet with a sharp Conflict: And indeed so it fell out. For, Apollyon perceiving his Faith very weak,    [   A fearful Combat between a Young Convert, and Apollyon .  ] set upon him so furiously, that he was almost drove into Despair: And not knowing but it may be of use to some, we will give you an Account of his Combat with Satan . Apoll. You have been a very great Sinner , in entertaining this Traveller, who is a cruel Enemy to God ; and now there is no ground to think God will forgive you, for his Wrath will overtake you suddenly. Illumi. The storm of God's Wrath, Satan , is over in Christ ; he declares,  88 He is Merciful, and will not keep his Anger for ever . Apoll. But alas!  89 you are Ignorant of God and Christ , and he will take Vengeance on all such; doth not the Scripture say so? Illumi. But Satan, God has promised to Lead the Blind ,  &c. And in another place, He calls simple Ones ,  90 and those that have no Understanding . Apoll. But your Heart is hard and obdurate, you know not the Vileness of it, there is not a filthier Creature under the Heavens; and therefore, you are certainly an undone man. Illumi. But God has promised to give me a heart of Flesh, and take away my stony heart; and if I loath my self for my Vileness,  91 he hath promised to wash and cleanse me from all my Sins . Apoll. But you have been as Wicked as you could well be, and therefore are a damned Creature. Illumi. Ay, Satan . I can't deny that; but yet God hath promised Mercy and Pardon, to such who have spoken and done as evil things as they could;  92 and therefore there is hope for me. Apoll. But all this while you do but Complement with me: you do not think indeed, there is Mercy for you in God's Heart. Illumi. I do not Complement, thou liest in that;    [   Satan's subtil Insinuations.  ] though I can't deny but I have through thy Temptations been so foolish to think so indeed. But God sayes, His Thoughts are not my Thoughts, and hath also said, He will abundantly Pardon me ,  93 if I turn from my evil wayes ; therefore 'tis no matter what my Thoughts have been. Apoll. But, for all this, I shall be too hard for thee, and break thy Head e're I have done. Illumi. No, the Promise runs, You shall but bruise my Heel . Apoll. I, but you forgot your abominable Sins ; remember the fearful lewd Life, you have liv'd Illumi. Christ dyed for Sinners, and I fly to him. Apoll. But you have Sinn'd against Light and Knowledg. Illumi. What though I am but a Sinner Satan? notwithstanding, and Christ dyed for Sinners. Apoll. But you can't Believe, you are guilty of that Sin ;  94 and he hath said, Such who Believe not shall be Damned. Illumi. But Satan , if I can't Believe, yet I may Believe; God can give me Faith ,    [   The Death of Christ a Ground of Hope .  ] and though I am now an Unbeliever, and so the worst of Sinners, yet I am but a Sinner, and Christ dyed for Sinners; nay Satan , for the chiefest of Sinners; and therefore, I will not give up my Hope yet. Apoll. Hope! You have no Ground for Hope . Illumi. No, Satan ; that is false, I am sure: Is not Christ's Death a Ground, nay, a good Ground for Hope? Who shall Condemn? 95 It is Christ that Dyed . On his Blood and Merits I will rely. Apoll. What good can his Death do thee? How can He save thee, who could not save Himself? I brought Him to the Grave. Illumi. Thou cursed Blasphemer! He laid down his Life freely, (none took it from Him) to satisfie God's Justice , and Rose again from the Dead the Third Day ; and thereby, tryumph'd over Thee, and all the Powers of Darkness: And is not his Resurrection a good Ground of Hope? Apoll. But I do accuse thee, and will plead against thee; because thou hast been so long my Servant , and an Enemy to Him. Illumi. I matter not that; thou art a vile Deceiver: The other Day thou didst endeavour to perswade me, my Sins were small, and that God would Pardon them at any time: And are they now so great and foul, that Christ's Blood can't wash them away? What care I, though thou do'st plead against me, since Jesus Christ pleads for me? Is not the Intercession of Christ for Transgressors , a good Ground of Hope . Apoll. Thou hast no Grace , or not enough to save thee; and therefore, thy State is very sad. Illumi.   [   The abundance of Grace in Christ , a Ground of Hope .  ] Christ hath Grace enough; and I depend not upon the Grace , that is in me; but on that Grace , which is in Him: He is full of Grace ; and 'tis in Him, that it might be communicated to all such that I am. And is not here a good Ground of Hope? Apoll. Thou wilt fall into Sin again, at some time or another; and I shall devour thee. Illum. God has promised, in his Blessed Covenant ,  96 That Sin shall not have Dominion over us ;  97 and, That He will put his Fear so into our Hearts, that we shall not depart from Him . And is not his Covenant a good Ground for Hope? Nay, and He hath said, That He will bruise thee under my Feet, shortly. Moreover, He has promised, He will uphold me: 98 And Christ hath pray'd, That my Faith fail not ; and, I am sure, He was heard. Besides, He has confirmed all his Promises, by an Oath: And is not here good Ground for me to hope , He that hath begun a Good Work in me , 99 will perform it to the Day of Christ? Apoll. Thou art an Hyppocrite . Illum. 'Tis the Father of Lies , that sayes it. Is there any Sin , that I have not been humbled for, and forsaken? Do I not desire to be Holy , as well as Happy? Satan , I fear, nor hate, nothing more than Hypocrisie ; and therefore, am no Hypocrite: But if I am an Hypocrite , I am but a Sinner ; and Christ dyed for Sinners ; and all Sins against Father, and Son, shall be forgiven to Men . But I am no Hypocrite ; because all the Faculties of my Soul are in Arms against and Sin , and against it universally; against the Least, as well as the Greatest. Apoll. I will cause strange Evils to befal thee. Illumi. 100 All things shall Work together for my Good, if I love God: And though I lose my Life for Christ's sake, I shall find it: When the Storm comes, I will flye to Him. Apoll. Thou canst not go to God as a Saint ; for thou art none. Illum. I will go to Him, then, as a Sinner ; for that I am, thou say'st: and there are as many Promises of Mercy and Pardon made to Sinners , as Sinners ; as are made to Saints , as such. Apoll. Would I could tear thee in pieces, and devour thee at once; thou vile Enemy: Thou hast done, and wilt do, me a great Mischief. All my Plagues light upon thee. Illumi. What, Satan , are you angry? Alas for you! 'Tis not All you would , but All you may , devour: Blessed be God , you cannot prevail against me. By this time he got the Shield of Faith , and so stoutly resisted Apollyon , that he suddenly fled,    [   The Soul's Conquest over Satan .  ] and left the Young Man the Conqueror, and Master of the Field. But this so enraged the Enemy , that he made fearful Work amongst the rest of the poor Inhabitants . Yet there was another Youth , that God graciously was pleased to work upon; who, in a little time, was filled with much Joy. But Apollyon , perceiving he exceeded therein, set upon him, by the Help of his cursed Agent, Peccatum , with so much Fury, that he was puff'd up with Spiritual Pride in such sort, that he was taken with a Phrensie ; and, for some time, quite Distracted: Which made many vain Persons to open their Mouths against the Ways of Godliness . But God , in a short time, was Gracious to him, and brought him into a sweet State of Peace , and Settlement of Mind: And so he continues, to the Praise of Infinite Grace . Also, Another that lived not far off, who had been a grievous Sinner , was, by the Word and Spirit of God ,    [   Another Young Man under great Temptations, get the Victory.  ] brought under a gracious Work ; but, for want of Faith , was, for sometime, under sad Despair: And Satan got such Power over him, that one while he was perswaded he had no Grace ; another while, that he had sinned against the Holy Ghost: And, sometimes, he thought, every thing he did was Sin ? insomuch, that he was afraid to Eat or Drink: Nay, he told one, That when he did endeavour to rely upon the Blood and Merits of Christ , he was perswaded, it was Presumption: And having Received the Lord's Supper , 101 he was tempted to believe, He had eat and drunk his own Damnation ; and was Guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ: Insomuch,    [   Some Souls Satan lifts up with over much Joy, and others he throws down with over much Sorrow. ] that he became very low, and weak, in his Body; and some were ready to fear, he would have been distracted by over-much Sorrow: Nay, and oft-times he was tempted to destroy himself. But God , in a short time, by his Spirit , gave him much sweet Peace , and Joy , in Believing; so that the Tyrant was overcome again: But except these, and a few more, all generally in Touth- shire , were put, as it were, to the Sword. So that all the Country lay a-bleeding, or weltring in their Blood, being fearfully mangled by the Hands of this Merciless Monster , and Cursed Traveller, Sin . So that, come where you would, in City and Country , you could hear of nothing, hardly, but horrid Oaths, Cursing and Swearing, Whoring and Damning , as if Hell had been broke loose: Also, in most Places, and Company, where they came, those who would not run with them to the same Excess of Riot , were their meer Sport and Song; every one striving to out-do his Fellow ; and so be, as it were, the Captain-General under Apollyon, Prince of Darkness: Who was not content to Fight with one Weapon only, by which he flew most, viz. by Fleshly Lusts and Debauchery ; but also introduc'd many abominable Errors , and pernicious Heresies ; which destroy'd divers others, who had escaped the gross Pollutions of the World .  Fond Youths, be wise! How sad it is to see You carry'd thus away by Luxury ; And strive to list your selves, with speed, to fight Under Hell's Power? O 'tis a grievous Sight! Why will you thus subject to Sin's Commands? As if your Lease of Life were in your Hands? What, do you think, Death will not come at all, That you no more regard your fearful Fall? Or do you think, God will defer the Day; That, by your Lust, you thus are led away? You proud, lascivious Lads, that sport and spend; Who know no Measure; that regard no End: For whose Luxurious Dyet and Array, Do sell your Souls, and all you have away: You little think, your Bodies soon shall feed The crawling Worms, which in the Dust do breed. Dart down your Eyes, to pierce but two yards deep, Into the Grave, where you, ere long, must sleep: Behold the Corps, and Skulls, of those young Men, That once walk'd here, and must arise again. Come, cast an Eye, you Lads, and Ladies gay, Upon the loathsome Filth, the Worms and Clay. Your Eyes, that are so curious to behold The Body deck'd in Ornaments of Gold; That, like two Orient Crystals, gave their Light, To look on Vanity both Day and Night: Cast one Look down: O here's for you a Sight! Behold, I pray, your antient teeming Mother; For all the World does not know such another; Whose Royal, Burden'd, Honourable Womb, So many Noble Heroes doth intomb: Where all the Famous Heroes do remain; Who Conquer'd many; but, by Death, were slain. Whose glittering Swords Ambition kept from Rust: Their Glory ended Here; they're turn'd to Dust. O ponder well! Alas, your Time is short; When Death will put a Period to your Sport. But that's not all; I've worser News to tell; Forsake your Sins, or else you'll go to Hell. The Wages of Sin is Eternal Death;  102 Unless you do experience a New-Birth .  Shewing how Tyrant-Sin Travelled into the vast Country , called Sensuality ; wherein is discovered, the Nature, Manners, and strange Customs of the Inhabitants; Together, with the Strength, Government, Trade, and other Rarities, found in a great City, Situated in the same Regions: And of the Prodigious and Shameful Pranks he played there. As also, Shewing the manner how three of the Inhabitants thereof, made their escape out of the said City and Country .  and near quite overcome and laid waste, the Country of Non-Age , and Youth- shire ) thought now he had sufficiently stored the Country of Sensuality with Inhabitants; and therefore was resolved to Travel again into those Parts, and give them a fresh Visit: But before we relate any thing concerning his Projects here, it may not be a miss, to give you a Description of the Country ; with the Nature, Manners , and Customs , of the Inhabitants . First , then, You must know,    [   Sensuality , a mighty large City . ] that this Country is very large (it is indeed, the biggest Continent in the whole World) the Latitude, Longitude, and whole Circumference thereof, is wonderful, and amazing to think upon: For, in this Country , lies the greatest Part of Muscovy, Tartary , with the vast Empire of Mahomet , or Kingdom of Turkey, Prester John's Land , with the biggest part of America ; And the East and West-Indies : Also, in some Parts and Confines thereof, lies the great City Babylon , containing divers mighty Streets; with Spiritual Sodom and Egypt ; where our Lord was Crucified. Moreover, There is also a City, which bears the same Name the Country doth, of which we shall hereafter speak more particularly: it lies just as you enter into the Borders thereof. Now, as touching the Inhabitants, the like you have hardly ever heard of: For this Bloody Tyrant, Sin , it seems, had formerly been amongst them; and by his Devillish Art , and Subtil Witchcraft , had so strangely metamorphosed the People, that they are not at all (in many respects) like    [   Mankind naturaly strangely degenerated.  ] Rational Creatures; for they appear to have no more Reason, than the Beasts that perishes; nay, and are, for certain, so far degenerated from what once they were, for some of them (I find in Holy Writ ) look like Lions , others like Dragons, Dogs, Tygers, Bulls, Wolves, Swine, Serpents, Foxes ,  &c. And many of them like Asses ; and also act the parts of all these sorts of Animals . For,   [   Some Wicked-men in the Scripture, compared to Lyons .  ] First , some of them, Lyon-like , look Fierce, Sower , and of a stern Countenance ; or, as Aristotle saith, have Clouds and Storms hanging about their Eye-brows; nay, and most of the common Epithets (given to Lyons by the Learned, may very well be given also to them, which are these; viz. Wrathful, Fierce, Deadly, Stout, Preying, Ravening, Snatching, Cruel, Bloody, Terrible, Swelling, Stony-hearted, Frowning, Violent ,  &c. Hence David said; His Soul was among Lyons ,  103 even among them that are set on Fire; even the Sons of Men, whose Teeth are as Spears and Arrows: 104 and in another place he prays, That God would rescue his Soul from Destruction, and his darling from the Lyons . Others,  105 the Holy Scriptures calls Dogs; Give not that which is Holy (saith Christ ) to Dogs :  106 And in another place, saith he; It is not meet to take the Children's Bread, and cast it to Dogs .  107 Beware (saith the Apostle) of Dogs ,  108 &c. Without are Dogs, and Sorceres, and Whoremongers ,  &c. Why should God compare any Wicked Men to Dogs ,    [   Why Wicked Men in Scripture are compared to Dogs .  ] but from the consideration of their Natures, and evil Disposition? for as Dogs are a Base, Ignoble, Sordid, Impudent, Filthy, Churlish, Grinning and a Snarling sort of Creatures; so are divers of the People, who inhabit the Country of Sensuality . And as Dogs are made use of by the Hunts-man, to observe and seize his Prey; so hath Apollyon made use, in every Age, of the Church of Ungodly Men , to hunt, prey upon, and seize on God's Davids , who were alwayes pursued like Partridges , upon the Mountains;  109 wandring about in Sheeps-skins and Goats-skins, Desarts, Dens, and Caves of the Earth. Others are likened to Swine ;    [   Some compared to Swine .  ] Neither cast ye your Pearls before Swine : ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 110 For as Swine love to be in the Mud, & c. and are a beastly sort of Creatures ; so do many of these People wallow in the Filth and  111 Mire of all manner of horrid Pollution, Sin , and Beastliness ; being greedy and unsatisfied; never knowing when they have enough; eating the Acorns that lie under the Tree; but never look up to see from whence they come: And, like Swine , they do hardly any Body good, until they die. A Wicked Usurer (saith Bonaventure) is like a Hog; for whilst he liveth, he is good and profitable for nothing; for he will ever be rooting up the Earth, running through and tearing Hedges; regarding no Fence nor Bounds; but when the Hog is dead, then cometh profit to some by him . Moreover, Many of them are like Bulls ;    [   Why others are compared to Bulls .  ] who are the Ring-leaders of the Herd , having a strong and stiff Neck and Head; and are found often pushing with their Horns: So some of these Degenerate Animals are Ring-leaders to all the Herd of Evil Doers ; and being heady and Stiff-necked, they refuse to return to God , and subject to his Laws and Blessed Gospel , in the Power of it: But, contrariwise, push at, and gore, their poor harmless Neighbours ( i.e. ) in unjust manner, by Law-suits, and otherwise injuring them: Which made King David ,  112 of Old, to cry out; Many Bulls have compassed me; strong Bulls of Bashan have beset me round . Also, as Bulls are let alone, and suffer'd to feed and fatten in Pastures that are none of their own, until the Day of Slaughter comes: So God suffers some of these Ungodly Ones to eat and drink as they please; and to go in the Wayes of their own choosing; being given up to their own Hearts, Lust, and to walk in their own Council; until God smites them by the Hand of the King of Terrors . And because they are subject to hurt, and do mischief, to the damage of their Owners, they are often shackled and penn'd up: Even so doth God frequently deal by the Enemies of his Church:  113 The Wrath of Man shall praise thee, and the remainder of Wrath shalt thou restrain . No more of Man's Wrath shall be let out upon God's People, than shall, in the end, turn to God's Glory . Again, Others are not in vain, in the Holy Scripture ,    [   Some like Wolves .  ] compared to Wolves ; whose Epithets , (as Elianus, Pliny and Gesner observes) are these; viz. Sour, Wild, Swift, Degenerate, Gluttonous, Hungry, Famishing, Bloody, Cruel, Insatiable, Treacherous, Martial, Ravenous, Nightly: The Caldeans , who were the Enemies of Israel of Old,  114 were said to be fiercer than the Evening Wolves: And so have the Papists been to the Church of God , for many Hundred Years: And how do many Wolf- like , long for the Night; they are for Night-work ; they Love Darkness, rather than Light, because their Deeds are Evil : Being great Destroyers, in every Nation, of God's Flock, and know not when they have done Mischief enough: And though many False-Teachers appear in Sheeps-cloathing ;  115 yet inwardly they are but Ravening Wolves . Others have the Nature and Property of Foxes ;    [   Others like Foxes .  ] being Crafty, Wary, Deceitful, Stinking, Quick-smelling, Contentious, Rough, Fiery-colour'd, Subtil , for Slaughter ,  &c. Great Destroyers of Vines , and many innocent Creatures; Take us the Foxes ,  116 the little Foxes, that spoil the Vines ,  &c.   [   Some Ungodly People like Goats .  ] And then some others, are by our Saviour , likened to Goats; He will set the Sheep on his right hand, and the Goats on the other ; whose Epithets given by the Learned, are these; viz. Left-handed ,  117 Greedy, Unarm'd (so are Wicked Men , when they engage with the Almighty) Rough, Ragged, Unclean, Strong-smelling, Treacherous, Bristler, Wanderer, Vile, Wanton ,  &c. There is no Creature (saith Genser) that smelleth so strong, as doth the Male-Goat, by reason of the immoderate Lust, which he is exceedingly prone and addicted to, above other Creatures . Even just so do some of the Inhabitants of the Country Sensuality , stinck in the Nostrils of God , and all sober and good Men, by reason of their Beastly , Unsatisfied ,  118 and Unnatural Lusts ,  &c. Now, I think on't, they say there are divers horned Beasts of a strong kind; and some, having them tipp'd with Silver, seem very well contented to wear them. Lastly, Many of them are like Asses ; for as the Wild Ass, used to the Wilderness, snuffeth up the Wind at her pleasure ;  119 being inflamed with Lusts (as Naturalists observe) So do these snuff up, and feed upon their filthy, sensual Delights: But in her Mouth they shall find her ; so at the time of their Calamity , or at Death , you may find these Asses tame enough: You may talk, and pray with them then, and be welcom. They also resemble the Ass in other respects: only in one thing they differ; the Ass knows his Master's Crib ;  120 but these neither know themselves, the Lord , nor where, when, nor how, they should Spiritually feed their Souls: For the truth is, as they are just like Bruit Beasts , in many respects; so divers of them, doubtless, do not think they have any Souls at all to be accountable for, at the Last Day , any more than the Beasts , but that they shall perish as they do. There is one thing more to be noted (which is sad,    [   Sensual and Ungodly Ones, wounded, naked and loathsome in Gods sight.  ] respecting the People of this vast Country ) viz. They are so Cut, Mangled, and Slaughter'd, by Sin , that some have no Eyes to see (he has put them out) nor Ears to hear, what God by his Word or Works declares; nay, all their Spiritual Senses, in many of them, are quite lost; and their very Hearts and Consciences are rotten, and grievously defiled, so that from the Crown of their Heads, to the Soles of their Feet, there is nothing but Wounds and Bruises, and filthy Sores. Moreover, the Tyrant hath stript them of all Soul-Raiment and Ornaments;  121 that in the sight of him who hath Internal Eyes, they appear as Naked as ever a Child did, new born: ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 122 And yet they are so Deluded, that there is not one in Twenty of them ashamed; what Cover any have, is but like unto ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 123 filthy Rags, or a menstruous Cloth, or those Cloths that are taken off of old Ulcers , or filthy Running and stinking Sores ; and yet some of them vaunt themselves in Pride, and spot their Faces, as if they were peerless for Beauty.  O sad it is, that the Soul, once Noble born, Should thus be Naked, Filthy, Blind and torn; They, who in Splendor to seeming shine so bright, Are all Deform'd, and blacker than the Night. Foul Putrefaction doth their Beauty cover; They're full of Ulcers, and defil'd all over: The infection spreads it self in every part, Their Eyes, their Hands, their Head, their Feet, their Heart; Their Arms are filled with unchaste imbraces; Their Glory's gone, who void are of all Graces. Saints Breath is sweeter than Arabian Spices, Whose rare Perfumes makes Houses Paradises . But their's offensive to all, who come near them, Their Tongue's Unclean, they pray, but God won't hear 'em. But possibly, some may inquire, what Food the Country does afford; I cannot, alas, but pity them, upon that very Account; for the Soil is very Barren, the Nature, Ground, or Product of the Country is such, that it yields no Food for their Souls, but Ashes, Husks, Chaff , and Gravel-stones ; only some of the Asses feed on the Wind, and snuff up the East-Wind . Sirs, This is no Romance; if you search Sacred Records , you will find 'tis really so; Pray, doth not the Scripture say, They feed on Ashes  124 ; and on Chaff, and the Wind ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 125 ? Pray, what far Country was it, that the Prodigal Son went into? And what Citizen was that, but Satan , whose Swine he fed with; and fain would have filled his Belly with the Husks  126 they did eat? What are all the Pleasures, Honours , and Riches of the World, but as Chaff and Husks, Ashes and Gravel-stones , compared with the Dainties of our Fathers House? Thus I have given you a brief Account of the Monstrous Dispositions and Customs of the People of this great Infamous Country ; where many live in Honour, and understand not; and therefore, are said to be Like the Beast that perishes : And I am sure you cannot go amongst them, but you will find (if you have not lost your Reason with them) these things so. Alas, how like fat and pamper'd Horses do some of them appear, every one (as the Prophet says) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 127 Neighing after his Neighbours Wife This is the Country , where Sin and Apollyon strive to fit Men and Women to Inhabit, and take up their Dwellings in. But, since I told you of the City Sensuality ,    [   The City Sensuality hath a wide Gate.  ] that lies just as you enter into the Country ; it is needful to speak first of the Gate ; which is so exceeding wide, that Ten Thousand may go in together, with much ease: Yet 'tis divided into five Divisions;    [   The five Senses .  ] and the way to it seems (to Fools ) to be strew'd with Roses : And before the great Gate , is all manner of Fleshly Allurements , to entice Travellers ; for there stands a multitude of Fair Ladies ; some with Spotted Faces, Naked Breasts and Shoulders , and Rowling and Wanton Eyes : So that the Simple cannot but be taken with the Sight. And then to please another of the Five Senses , they are very Gentle, and as willing to come to hand, and be play'd with, as ever was Joseph's Mistress . Also there stands, continually, at the Gate , the Waits of the City ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 128 with all sorts of Rare, and Flesh-ravishing Musick; that makes such a melodious Sound, that the Ear is engaged presently. And then, for the Sense of Smelling ; there are the rare Perfumes of the East, Myrrh, Alloes and Frankincense . For Tasting ; you have a Company of good Fellows , standing with Bottles of the best Spiced Wine, Brandy , and Tankards of Ale and Beer in their Hands; saying, Here Boys, is your rare Bub ; come, let us Drink Carouse it, and be Merry. You may have also, for your Money, the most delicious Food , that the World affords: But you cann't (they say) have a Breakfast of the best Sort, under Ten, or Twenty Pounds: But, according to your Purse or Pocket , and Gluttonous Appetites , you may be accommodated; provided you will eat and drink to Excess: For otherwise, there is no Entrance for you (that would come in) at this Gate (from whence you may gather, the Inhabitants have not lost the Senses of the Body , though they have the Spiritual Senses of the Soul .) But to proceed: The Gate that lets into the City , hath three Steps ascending: The First is,    [   Three steps into the City .  ] the Conception of Lust ; The Second is, the Sweet and Flesh-pleasing Contemplation thereof; The Third is, Free Consent , and yeilding thereto: Which no sooner you get upon, but you are in the City. Also, You must know, the Strength of the Place, is very great: 'tis as strong indeed, as, Sin and Apollyon , the Prince of Darkness , could make: For they first Founded, or Raised, the Fabrick ; and have fortify'd it to the purpose. It hath Three exceeding high,   [   Three Walls about the City Sensuality .  ] and Impregnable Walls round about it. The First is, Blindness of Mind ; The Second is, Presumption ; The Third Unbelief . Then under the Wall , lies a wonderful deep, and dangerous Ditch, or Moat; which if any of the Inhabitants , who by striving to get out of the City, chance to fall into, 'tis a Thousand to One, if they ever get out again, but perish there for ever. This Ditch is called Despair : thought) some Thousands of Skulls of Men and Women, & c. would be found there, who Apollyon had formerly tumbled into it; whom they saw the Wall of Presumption, &c. could not keep in the City any longer. And then, the Watch that keeps the Gate (for 'tis alwaies shut to them that are within) is Peccatum , with divers infernal Spirits ; all well Arm'd: Insomuch, that without infinite power there is no escaping. Now at the farther end of the City is a Gate, also, as wide as the other; and that stands alwayes open: the Porter's Name is Death . Moreover, behind that Gate, is an exceeding deep Lake ; that sends forth nothing but a black sulphurous Smoak of Fire and Brimstone : And all that die in this City, Sensuality , go out at that Gate; and so fall into the Lake , which burns more fierce than Mount Æ tna , or Strombalo . In the Heart of the Town, is a strong and wonderful Castle ; ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   A strong Castle in the City Sensuality . ] where Apollyon keeps his Court, which is called hardness of heart . Now, One great thing Tyrant-Sin is employed about, is to bring all the Inhabitants, one after another, gradually, as they enter the City, into this Castle. He that is Keeper of the Castle, is one Obstinate , a very impudent and grim Fellow. The Walk or Path to the Castle, is pleasant enough; but at the entrance of the Gate,   [   Four gradual Steps into the Castle .  ] is four Steps very fair to set your Feet upon: The First is called Extenuation of Sin ; to make great Sins small, and little Sins to seem none at all. Some say, that this Step is made of two sorts of Materials, viz. not only to lessen or extenuate Sin , but also to make excuses about it, viz. I was drawn in; my Heart is good ,  &c. The third Step is called, Delight in Sin ; and from hence 'tis defended, and pleaded for, by such who get up thus high. The fourth and last Step, is, final Impudence : then you are in the Castle, and are made Free-Citizens , having a Right to all the Priviledges and Immunities, Trade and Traffick thereof. On the East-side of the City, towards a little Town called Religion , is a very little Gate so straight,    [   The narrow Gate of Regeneration  ] that but a very few can get through: 'Tis called Regeneration ; and he that opens it, hardly One in a Thousand, who dwells in the City, does know; whose Name is Repentance : This Gate, as Peccatum , nor the Prince of Darkness never made it; so are they not able (notwithstanding all their strength and power) to keep it always shut: But they so blind the Eyes of the Citizens, 129 that but few can find it. Moreover, You must know, that in this City Tyrant-Sin keeps every Day in the Week (none excepted) a great Market,    [   A Market kept in the City Sensuality .  ] where he exposeth to Sale divers very rich Commodities on easie Terms, 'Tis marvelous indeed, to see how dog-cheap they are sold, considering their great Worth. For, First ,    [   Modesty sold at a cheap rate.  ] Here you may buy Modesty of some, which is a choice thing, for a Kiss, and a Toy or two, if you miss not in presenting them after the new Mode: The same Commodity you may have of others for a rare Antick Fashion, which like Shop-windows makes a Shew of a richer Jewel to be had upon reasonable rates within. Some (saith one) who go with Naked Breasts and Shoulders , may be honest, but very few will believe it: But how downright was Old Father Jerome , in upbraiding the Loose and Wanton Ones , who lived in his Dayes. [ Habet in Castro Amazones, Viros ad Libidinem provocantes, Mamma exerta & Brachio rado ] "Who with their naked Breasts strutting out, and Arms tuck'd up to the Shoulders , did in that posture seem rather to challenge Combats into the Fields of Venus , than make any shew of fighting under the Banner of a Crucified Saviour ." But what do I mention the holy passion of this good Man in this place? What can be expected in such a City, where Sin hath Erected his Throne; having made a perfect Conquest? Thou mayst go on Father Jerome , and rail against bare ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   How many says worthy Down ham , do openly profess their inward Uncleanness , by laying open to the common view their naked Breasts , as tho' it were a Bill affixed to the Door-Posts, to signifie, to the Passers by, that within that Place dwells an unclean Heart ; and that whosoever will, may buy Honesty and Chastity at an easie rate. Whores , says another, use to discover their Filthiness much in their Breasts ; either in the Nakedness of them, or in those Ornaments they hang there. To what purpose are those Garments so pompous; those Stuffs so costly; those Guizes so sought after; those Colours so fantastick, so shameless; those extravagant Patches so abominable, unless it be to cut the Throat of Chastity ? says another.  ] Necks and Breasts (as the Flames that consume Youth, the Incentives of Lust, and never-failing Ensigns of an impudent mind ;) till thou art weary; and by these sort of degenerate Animals be but laughed at for thy pains. Secondly , Say what you will, Chastity is sold at the Market, in this City, very cheap; of some it cannot be had, they say, under 10 or 20 s. nay, and possibly, others may set a far greater Price upon it, who are willing to be Traders too: but I hear there be some poor Whores, those, that offer it for little or nothing; a Bottle or two of good Wine, 'tis said will purchase it. Thirdly , There is to be sold those excellent Pearls of Temperance and Sobriety , for the value of one Quart of good Canary, or rather than fail, for a dozen of Beer, or Ale, or for a Pint of Brandy; and the Person so well contented, that he matters not, though he spue and wallow in his Filth like a drunken Swine to confirm the Bargain. Fourthly , Here is also to be sold a Thing called Truth , or honest Dealing , for the gain of a Penny, if not a Farthing. Such is their love of Money. Fifthly , And a good Conscience , if there is any such Commodity in the whole Town, is to be sold at the very same price. The love of Money is the Root of all Evil . Sixthly, Peace and inward Tranquility of Mind on as easie terms, if it be possible to find it amongst them. Seventhly , Which is more than all the rest, God, Christ , and all the Blessings purchased by (the price of) his most precious Blood , with all the inconceivable priviledges of the Gospel, are not esteemed by most of the Inhabitants, of the City Sensuality , worth one Lust ; and therefore let them but Drink, Damn, Swear , and Whore, &c. And let who will take all such things, with Heaven it self, & c. But to proceed, in this City,   [   A School in the City Sensuality .  ] Sin that Hellish Monster of Pollution , also, keeps a School: (You must needs think the People are Educated with a vengeance, who have such a Tutor;) but pray be pleased to hear what rare Arts they are which he instructs them in. First , He teaches all that are willing to learn of him, that deep Art of Witchcraft , and Conjuration , but that is upon dear terms. Secondly , He teaches the Art of Swearing , with all its Attendance. Thirdly , The Art of Drunkenness and Gluttony; viz. how to drink Wine and strong Liquors abundantly; and to dress Meat on purpose, to provoke and make Provision for the Flesh . Fourthly , The Art of Ambition , or sinful Grandeur . Fifthly , The Art of Covetousness , a great Mystery; for (if well learned) thou mayst be as greedy a Curmudgeon as any lives, and yet go for a liberal Person. Sixthly , But here is taught the curious Art of Bravery, viz. all the newest, nearest and most rarest Fashions, that can be had for Love or Mony; but chiefly those which tend to stir up to Wantonness, Lust , and lascivious Embraces ; some of which you have heard already; but not only for the Body, but for your Houses, and all things else. Seventhly , The delicate Art of Painting ,    [   St. Cyprian saith, The Devil first taught the Art of Painting the Face, &c. and Jerome , as I find him quoted, was of the same mind. What, saith he, makes the white and red Varnish , and Paint for the Face \---whereof one sets a false Die and lying Tincture on the Cheeks and Lips , the other an hypocritical fairness on the Neck and Breasts ; and all this is to enflame young, wanton Affections ; to blow up the sparks of Lust ; and to shew what a Whorish and impudent Heart dwells within those daubed Walls ? How can such an one weep for her Sins , when the Tears would wash away the Colours , and so discover the Cheat?---The Painting the Face (saith he) is the deforming God's Image and Workmanship ; and is most Damnable.  ] or Beautifying the Skin, Face, Hands and Hair, &c. as the colouring the Eye-brows , clapping on a false and lying Blush on the Cheeks ; and to change the very Natural Colour of the Hair ; nay, and to adulterate the True and Naked Complexion of the whole Head and Face . Eighthly , The mysterious Art of Perfuming , not only the Hair , but the Skin, Cloaths, Bedding, Linnen , and Woollen, &c. on purpose to stir up Lust , and so keep up the Trade of the City. Ninthly , The Art of Whoring ; and the Truth is, this being a great part of the City-Trade, Apollyon , it seems, takes great care to instruct these sort of Dealers, that they might be better Proficients, if possible, than many others: Some he directs to stand with shameless and impudent Faces at their Doors, in the Twilight , bravely garnished with Taffatie- Gowns, &c. and tho' it is known what they are, yet they are here but laughed at: The Tradesmen in other Cities, at Night shut up their Shops; but these then open theirs; when other persons Trade is over, the Strumpets Trade begins: She is set on Work, and maintained perhaps, by those that undo the other. Give thanks, O wide mouth'd Hell ; laugh Lucifer at this; and dance for joy, all ye Devils! But this sort, likely, take up their Dwelling in the out-Parts; but there are others who are taught to Trade more secretly; and for fear, lest some People, who like not this Vice, should have them in derision; Apollyon , to prevent their being discovered, teaches them to manage their Works of Darkness subtilly, after this manner: If Gallants haunt the House where she is, then she is taught to say, she is a Captain's Wife, or such like, that is gone into the Wars in another Country; and they come with Letters from her Husband; and if Merchants resorts to her, then to hoise up these Sails; ( i.e. ) she is Wife to a Master of a Ship; and they bring News, that her Husband put in at the Straits , or Venice , or Constantinople , or at Alexandria , or Scanderoon, &c. If Shop- keepers comes to her, why, then she has bought some Goods newly of them, and they come for their Money; but if the Stream runs low, that none but Apron-lads , and Journey men , lanch forth, then she keeps a Politick Sempsters Shop; and she sells or starches their Linnen: And a multitude of such Devices 'tis reported they have. Tenthly , Here is taught also the Art of Cheating, Picking , and Stealing . Eleventhly , The Craft of Lying, Dissembling , and Equivocating . Twelfthly ,    [   Entituled Unreasonableness of Atheism .  ] To omit many more; as the Art of Scoffing, Reproaching and Villifying Virtue ; Here is taught the mysterious Art of Atheism . And if you please to read that most excellent Book writ by Sir Charles Wolsey , well worthy of perusing, you may see what a kind of Catechism the Atheists teach. Thirteenthly , Here is also taught the black and Hellish Art of Incest, Sodomy, Buggery ; and all manner of Beastly and Unnatural Lusts . Fourteenthly , The Art of Sports ; or all manner of unlawful Games . Fifteenthly , The Art of Mirth, Musick , and all kind of Flesh-ravishing Melodies ; with filthy Songs and abominable Romances , are taught here by ingenious Lads of Peccatum's own Tutoring.  That so he might their precious Time abuse, He doth assist and guide the wanton Muse , Which doth each Day bring forth Romances vain, The poysoned Froth of their infected Brain, Which only tend to nourish Rampant Vice ; And to Prophaneness easie Youth entice. But Reader, Notwithstanding we condemn all foolish and antick Fashions,   [ All new Fashions , with Musick, Persuming &c not in themselves unlawful in all Persons.  ] & c. yet we do not suppose that all new Modes, with Musick, Perfumings , and some Arts of preparing delicious Meats , for the pleasing of the sensitive Faculties , are utterly unlawful in themselves; and not to be allowed amongst any sorts or degrees of People; but 'tis the inordinate use thereof, or the ungodly abuse of them; we mean ( i. e. ) when they are used meerly to gratifie the Flesh in a wicked way, or used by those who are low in the World, and in Debt; or when others care not what Cost they are at about them, and yet never regard the Poor and Distressed in the Land, who will not give the tenth part of that which they bestow needlesly for the pampering of the Flesh (or gratifying of the sensual Appetites ) to Cloath the Naked, feed the Hungry, &c. But to proceed; in the next place, having done with the Trade of the City, it may not be amiss to speak a little of the Government thereof. First ,    [   The Government of the City Sensuality .  ] Their Statutes are very easie to the Flesh , being wholly under the Law of Sin, Loosness and Sensuality ; and how should it be otherwise, when this Monster of Pollution, Peccatum , bears the only Rule and Sway; for 'tis he that Reigns in their mortal Bodies, whom they obey in every Motion , and Lust whatsoever The Chief Judg that hears and determines all Cases of Doubt and Controversie, that may arise,   [   The chief Judg in the City Sensuality , &c.  ] is Depraved Judgment ; the inferior Magistrates, are Wilful-Will, Deceitful Memory , and Carnal Affections ; the Recorder is, Mis-led, Blind , and Evil Conscience . [   The Priviledges of the City Sensuality .  ] As touching the Priviledges of the City City Sensuality , they are very many; tho' I shall mention but two or three. First , The Inhabitants have free liberty to Trade in any Merchandize the City affords; and learn all the Arts thereof, if they please. Secondly , To break the Sabbath Day , and play at what Sport or Game they like best; or Carrouse it at Taverns, Ale-houses or Bawdyhouses ,  &c. Thirdly , To violate all the good Laws of God, Nature and Nations . Fourthly , To bring up their Children in the same Craft . Fifthly , To reproach and villifie all that are Godly or civilly honest ,  &c. Lastly , To enter in at the wide Gate (when ever they die) and go into the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone , it being alwayes open for them; but you must know, 'tis he that built this City, and is the chief Governour thereof, who grants all these priviledges; and that is the Devil . Now,   [   The Treasure of the City.  ] as every City hath (likely) a Stock or Treasure belonging to it; so hath this also, viz. First , A Stock of Infamy , that can never be exhausted. Secondly , a Stock of Filth and horrid Pollution . Thirdly , A Stock of Guilt , more than they can stand under. Fourthly ; The Treasure of a Rotten, Diseased and Loathsom Carkass . Fifthly , A Stock of all the Threats, Plagues and fearful Curses and Comminations , that are contained in the Old and New Testament . Lastly, A whole Heap of Wrath treasured up against the Day of Wrath;![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 130 and Revelation of the Righteous Judgments of God,  131 &c. There is yet one thing more, that I shall note, as touching the Inhabitants of this City ( viz. ) They are all Soldiers, being Trained up from their Childhood, in all Arts of War,    [   The Inhabitants of the City Sensuality fight against God. &c.  ] to fight under the Banner of the Prince of Darkness; Peccatum being their Commander in Chief. The Enemies they fight against, Are, 1\. The Great God of Heaven and Earth. 2. Jesus Christ . 3. The Holy Ghost ; whose Motions they are taught continually to resist. 4. Against the Light of Nature .  132 And Lastly , Against all Good Counsel, Reproofs or Exhortations , that any in love to their Souls, do at any time give them. Yet nevertheless,   [   One comes to the City-Gate to read Prayers.  ] a poor Reader adventured to come to the Gate of the City to say Prayers and give them good Instructions; and indeed, as it appeared, a great number of them seemed to attend upon what he said; but some good Fellows (who were Students in the Art of Drunkenness ) observing his Nose, when he had done, enticed him into the City, and got him into a Tavern , and made him beastly drunk , which one of the Sensual Ladies observing, allured him by her bewitching Stratagems to commit Folly with her; and I do not hear he has deserted the City ever since. But at last,   [   Theologue preaches at the Gate.  ] one Theologue , a learned and worthy Bishop, or Divine, was sent by his Blessed Master Jesus Christ to the City-gate to preach the Gospel to them, Who cried without, and uttered his Voice in the Streets ,  133 in the chief Place of Concourse, in the opening of the Gates ,  &c, How long ye simple Ones will ye love Simplicity; and Scorners delight in Scorning, and Fools hate Knowledg? Turn ye at my Reproof ,  &c. Unto you O Men I call ,  &c. Oh! Therefore leave your Folly, and forsake your evil Wayes; for that God whom you every Day provoke, is like to a Consuming Fire, and his Wrath is kindled against you ; therefore, if you do not acquit this Place, and fly to the City of Refuge, even now whilst it is called to Day, he will bring his Plagues and fearful Judgments upon you . But if any one of you bless himself in his 134 Heart, saying, I shall have Peace, though I walk in the Imagination of my own Heart; to add Drunkenness to Thirst: The Lord will not spare him; but then the Anger of Jehovah , and his Jealousie, shall smoke against that Man; and all the Curses that are written in this Book, shall lie upon him: And the Lord will blot out his Name from under Heaven. Oh! you Monsters of Wickedness; will you dare the Almighty? Can you prevail against the Bosses of his Buckler? Are you a Match for Him? Can you stand before his Indignation? I am come to call you out of this Hellish City; i.e. to leave your Sensual and Beastly Lives , and accept of Pardon through Jesus Christ . Oh! Is there none that will lay down their Arms, and close in with the Tenders of Grace: For though you are thus wicked, and have done as many Evil things as you could ;  135 yet there is Mercy for you, if ye Repent, and Believe in Jesus Christ . Oh, look about you, for the Lord's sake! Fire! Fire! Fire! Behold, the City is on fire at one End; and also Besieged by the Wrath of God: You are all undone Men and Women, if you do not speedily fly out, to save your Lives . You must, Sirs , Turn, or Die. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 136 Oh! How doth my Soul tremble, to behold what is coming upon you?  137 For A Fire is kindlrd (saith God) in my Anger; which shall burn unto the lowest Hell; and shall consume the Earth, with her Increase; and set on Fire the Foundations of the Mountains . And much He spake to the same purpose, with great Zeal, Courage, and Compassion; Tears standing in his Eyes, beholding their woeful Condition. But most of them did but laugh at Him;    [   Most of the Inhabitants of the City Sensuality slight God's Ministers.  ] and many abus'd Him with shameful Speeches: Yet some few were so far wrought upon, as to incline to what he said: and Two or Three, more especially, drew near to Him, bewailing their perishing State: But withal told Him, The City was so strong, they knew not which way to escape. This rejoyc'd his Heart. Now, when most of the rest were gone, He told them, There was a Little Gate , call'd Regeneration ; which, if they could but find, they might get out: But they told Him, it was like, that Gate was lock'd. Well (said He) but though it be, yet there is a Key which will open it; and that is , Prayer. Then they all Three went to Prayer ; and with many Tears, and bitter Sobs, cry'd to the Lord : and, at last, they found the Gate: But it was a great while, before they could find the Porter ; who is appointed to turn the Key; whose Name is Repentance : ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   Repentance the Porter that opens the Gate to Regeneration .  ] for Prayer , without his Help, cannot open the Gate of Regeneration: Yet their Eyes being enlightned, by the Spirit of Grace , they got through the First Wall, (but not without much Difficulty) which you heard, is Blindness of Mind: Then they came to the Second Wall, call'd Presumption ; and looking about them, they saw divers other poor People just at their Heels, thinking to get away also: But, when they beheld this Wall, they all stood still; For between these Two Gates, lies a large Green    [   These Green Fields are the Pleasures of the World .  ] Field ; and those People that came up to them, were resolved to abide there; concluding, now, they were got far enough from the City : And therefore, rested wholly upon the Mercy of God ; and so were kept in the City , under some common Illuminations of the Spirit , by the strong Wall of Presumption ;    [   Common Illuminations fail to help a Soul out of the State of Nature.  ] which is the Ruine of many Thousands. For when their Consciences are awakened, and they begin to be sensible, in some measure, of the woful State of Fallen Man ; yet, hearing of the Infinite Grace and Mercy of God in Christ , they go no further, but remain in their Sins ; and never strive after the Gate of Regeneration ; and yet hope to be saved. But those Three poor Souls were under a more special and through Work: For they call'd to mind, how Theologue had open'd to them the Nature of God's Justice , as well as his Mercy ; and that He would, in no wise, clear the Guilty; (and that they must, therefore, utterly forsake Sin ; and be Born again ,  138 or else could not see the Kingdom of God) Therefore, they durst not presume, upon God's Mercy , whil'st they remain'd in their Sins ; nor trust to Latter Repentance , (which seldom proves true.) By which means they got through this Wall likewise. Then they came along, with the Porter , to the Third and Last Wall, call'd Unbelief ; which they no sooner beheld, but their Hearts fail'd them: Wherefore they here stood still, and knew not what to do; fearing Apollyon would come out against them, and swallow them up quick, (for his Eye was fix'd upon them all the while.) And now he bestir'd himself to purpose; and, indeed, threatned them, that if they endeavour'd to go further, he would throw them over that Wall, into the Moat ; out of which few ever escaped with their Lives. Upon this their Hearts began to ake; and (poor Souls!) they trembled grievously: Yet looking back, to their Joy, they saw several Persons were coming up to them; having also got over the Wall of Presumption: But, Alas! their Joy was soon turn'd to Sorrow; for, lo! on a sudden, they perceiv'd Apollyon coming out upon some of those poor Creatures ; and, by the Help of Sin , he threw One or Two of them into the Ditch ,    [   Some Souls Satan throws into the Moat of Despair ; others he forces back into the City Sensuality .  ] or Moat of Despair ; and Others he forc'd to retreat back again. This struck some Terror to them: Yet these Three Worthies , having heard Theologue speak of the Virtue of Christ's Blood , and the Nature of Gospel-Promises , took fresh Courage: So that, after a Month or two, crying to God , the Gate that leads through this Wall , was open. Yet they had not Power to venture through: For One of them, more particularly, calling to mind his notorious, evil and debauch'd Life , he having liv'd a long time in the City Sensuality ; perceiv'd the deep and dangerous Moat , (through the Gate ) which, he concluded, he should fall into, and be undone for ever. For (saith he) we can never escape out of the City, unless we get over the Ditch, as well as through this Wall. But the other Two encourag'd and strengthen'd him as much as they could. But, Alas! all would not do: And, indeed, they, themselves, were full of Fears and Doubtings. But it was not long, before a most sweet and lovely Lady , with her several Daughters , (whom they had met with some time before, and receiv'd Help from) appear'd to them; whose Name was Grace ; who bid them not to fear: For (saith she) here is my Eldest Daughter , Faith;    [   Faith only helps poor Souls over Unbelief and Despair .  ] if you can prevail with her, she will soon (with the Aid of my Daughters , Hope and Charity) help you all through the Gate of Unbelief, and over the Moat of Despair too: and, indeed, none else can do it . Upon this they were wonderfully comforted, and fell a singing of Psalms of Praise to God . But Apollyon , immediately, most furiously assaulted them;    [   Faith puts Satan to Flight.  ] yet Faith by turning her Shield against him, made him quickly flie away, which was no little joy to them to behold; and at last they were resolved to throw themselves upon the Mercy of God , through the Blood of Jesus Christ , and adventure over: And if (saith One to the Other) we perish, we perish; there is nothing but Death, if we go back, or remain here . And thus they encouraged one another, and ventur'd in. And Faith , that most noble Off-spring of God , (with the Help of other Graces ) kept them from sinking: So that (thro' Infinite Goodness) they all Three escap'd. And just as they got over the Moat , they espy'd a clear and lovely Fountain set wide open ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 139 ; and Faith help'd them to wash, and bathe, themselves therein;    [ Christ's Blood is the Fountain wherein Faith washes away all sinful Pollution.  ] for they saw they were exceedingly polluted. After this, they hasted away, as fast as they could go, towards a little Town, call'd Religion , (which lies in the direct Way to New-Jerusalem .) But, Oh! with what Difficulty did they pass along the Country? For Sin pursu'd them close; so that, the first Day they escap'd the Moat , they were forc'd to mount a mighty Hill , call'd Opposition .    [   The Mountain of Opposition .  ] Here they were stop'd not only by Apollyon , and curs'd Peccatum , (by Hellish Temptations ) but the Country People, also, were stirred up by these bloody Enemies , to turn them back, or hinder them in their Flight. Yet they got up the Mountain ; and, the next Day, they fell down into a deep Valley ,    [   The Valley of Self-Denial hard to pass thorow.  ] call'd Self-Denyal: So difficult a Passage it is, that but few are able to pass along: And yet there is no other Way to New-Jerusalem . ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 140 And presently, upon this, they came to a certain Stile , (which, they perceiv'd, would also put them hard to't, to get over) it being call'd the Stile of Carnal Reason . But they,    [   The Stile of Carnal Reason .  ] not consulting with Flesh and Blood , made little of it. But, Alas! They were not gone much further, before they came into an Howling Wilderness ; through which, Theologue had told them, they must pass. And here they seem'd, for a while, to be at a stand; there being so many Turnings , and By-Wayes: And the Enemy , to amuse them, rais'd up several subtil Impostors , to put them out of the Right Path ; One crying, This is the Way ; and Another, That . Besides, they were assur'd, the Wilderness had many deep and dangerous Pits in it; and 'twas also very dark and dolesome: So that, if they had not met, sometime before, with an Able and Sure Guide , doubtless,    [   God's Word is our only Guide thorow the Wilderness of this World.  ] they had perish'd in this Place. But Truth was their only Conductor ; whose Counsel alwayes (as 'tis contain'd in the Holy Bible ) they resolved to take. So that they missed not their Way. But, it seems, Two or Three Dayes after, they met with many Lions , and other Evil Beasts ; yet they pass'd securely along, they having no Power to hurt them; tho' (poor Souls!) they were possess'd with great Fear: But Faith Travelling with them , vanquish'd their Doubts, and desponding Thoughts. But, yet, the Worst was not over: For, lo! on a sudden, they were beset with Thieves ; who threatned to knock them on the Head: but were restrain'd. Yet they Robb'd them of their Cloaths, and part of their Money. But they, calling to mind how wonderfully God had deliver'd them from Sin and Satan , mattered none of all these things: For now, to their inconceivable Joy and Comfort, they came into the Sweet and pleasant Way of the New-Covenant . And, at last, getting up upon the Top of an high Rock , call'd the Rock of Ages ,    [   Believers , when got upon the Rock of Ages, are safe.  ] they were safe enough; where they had a full View (when they look'd downwards) of the miserable Country of Sensuality , from whence they came; and when they look'd upwards, they saw (to the Ravishing of their Hearts) the Glory of that Heavenly Country they were going to; and where they will arrive, in due time. But here, at present, we must leave them; and pursue our History of the Travels of Bloody Peccatum . ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   Sin. ] .  Shewing how Tyrant Sin came, in his Travels , into the great Country of Commerce ; where formerly stood a Famous Town, called Morality : And what fearful Work he made There.  enlarged his Territories , and setled all things in the Great City Sensuality , and left Part of his Retinue and Attendance with many Infernal Spirits , to watch Night and Day, to keep all in Carnal Security there; was resolv'd now (in Company with Apollyon ) to Travel further: And, in a short time, he came into the Country of Commerce ; where stood, in former Times, that Famous and Honest Town ,    [   Sin and Apollyon great Enemies to Morality .  ] call'd Morality: Which, it appears, he hath an Implacable Hatred against: And therefore, took up a Resolution to ruine it, and lay it flat to the Ground; or, otherwise, by secret Policy, undo, or utterly beguile, or deceive, all the Inhabitants . Now, this Town (as I said) hath formerly been in great Esteem, being a Place of good Trade ; and many honest and well-meaning People dwelt in it: But this cursed Traveller , it appears, had been in it of Latter Times, before now; and, by his Subtilty, had made it a poor and despis'd Village , and very thin also of Inhabitants: Yet was not satisfy'd, but designs to try the other Bout; and raze it, if possible, to the very Foundation thereof. But since he is got into the Country , and hath also entred the Town ; let us observe his present Enterprize. First , He meets with one Peason that is very Rich; and him he entices to augment his Store; to grinde the Face of the Poor , by forcing them to sell their Commodities under the Market ; (he understanding their Necessities, his Family wanting Bread to eat, must sell their Goods.) And then he stir'd up Another, not to lend Money to any,    [   Some Pawn-Broakers unconscionable Miscreants.  ] though in never such Distress, without Extortion , or unconscionable Interest: Nay, and will have a Pawn too, or else not a Penny to be had: So that he hath, 'tis said, Twenty or Thirty per Cent , for his Money; and some, much more: And yet was taught, by this subtil Enemy , to boast, that he was the Poor People's best Friend; because none else would let them have any Mony at all, to Trade with; (as if he could not lend them it upon easier Terms.) Morover, Some he enticed to Monopolize , or ingross Commodities so into their own Hands, that none might sell of that sort, to gain any thing by them, but themselves. Divers Others, who, for a while, seem'd sober Persons, aud might have liv'd still in the Town of Morality , in good Credit; he allur'd to Lusts and Wantonness: By which means he sent them to dwell in the City Sensuality . Also, Many that were Poor , he taught them to Break their Word and Promises ; and, at last, their Bonds and Covenants ; nay, and Oaths too: Yea, and never left them, until he, by the Aid of the Devil , had made Thieves of them; and sent them to stand upon the High-Way. Also, Some he caus'd, in several Kingdoms, to deal unrighteously, and subvert Law and Justice , that naturally had better Principles: by which means sad havock was made in the Country of Commerce , and Town of Morality , throughout the World: Which caus'd the Prophet to cry out of Old; For our Transgression's are multiplied before 141 Thee, and our Sins testifie against us: For our Transgressions are with us; and as for our Iniquities, we know them. In transgressing, and lying, 142 against the Lord , and departing away from our God ; speaking Oppression and Revolt; conceiving, and uttering, from the Heart, Words of Falsehood. And Judgment is turned away backward; 143 and Justice standeth afar off: For Truth is fallen in the Streets, and Equity cannot enter. Yea, 144 Truth faileth; and he that departeth from Evil, maketh himself a Prey: And the Lord saw it, and it displeased Him, that there was no Judgment. Many he provoketh to borrow Money ,    [   Unlawful to borrow Money, and live high, when the Person knows not how to pay it again.  ] and live high, when they know, in their Consciences, they are not able to pay it: And after they have run into many Mens Debts, they make a Break of it; when they have not Five Shillings in the Pound , perhaps, to offer their Creditors . But, the Truth is, this was the Thing they design'd at first; which is no better than Robbery . Some Others he causes, when far in Debt, to Confess Judgments ; on purpose to cheat their Neighbors . And, that, which is the worst of all, he hath entic'd many, of latter Times, to shut up their Shops; to make People think they were undone by the Badness of the Times, and Trade: and so were forc'd to call their Creditors together, (poor Men) being willing, forsooth, to pay as far as they have; and that not above Eight or Ten Shillings in the Pound: When in truth, at the same time, they were worth some Hundreds . Alas! The whole Design was but to cheat, that they might enrcih Themselves . But, by this Device of cursed Peccatum ,    [   Some sorts of Bankrupts the worst of Thieves.  ] many honest People have been undone; and by such too, whom they little suspected, would ever have been led by the Devil , to become the worst of Thieves and Robbers: For they out-do those who stand on the High-Way ; for these more secretly, and insensibly, rob and undo the People they trade with. The common Thief Men provide for; being aware of him, they know the better how to secure themselves. Now, these are some of those Projects Sin plays in these Parts; whereby the Country of Commerce is strangely spoiled as if there were hardly an Honest Man in it: For now adays, no Man knows who to trust, deal, nor trade with. But, should I open all the Wayes, Tricks, and Inventions of Sin and Satan , by which the Town of Morality is invaded, and like utterly to be spoil'd; it would fill a great Volume: The Truth is, 'tis sadly batter'd down; and the Streets are thin of People, as in a Plague-Time. Old Father Honesty , and Mrs. Just-Dealing , are both dead: So that, if you ask for either of that Name, no Body knows how to direct you. Commodities are prais'd by the Seller , when he knows they are nought; and disprais'd by Buyer , when he sees they are good. Unlawful Profit is took; and yet cries the Shop-keeper, I cannot afford it cheaper . And another he cries, (nay, and swears too, may be) He will not abate a Farthing: And yet, perhaps, rather than lose his Customer , he takes many Pence , if not Shillings , less: And all the time they perceive not the Traveller , nor Satan neither, standing at their Elbow , prompting them thus to do; and laughing to see what a number of true Slaves and Vassals he has got in this Country: for every one seeks to subplant his Brother. I might further proceed, and shew how Sin corrupts and preys upon most Tradesmen and Others, in City and Country ; and what subtil wayes he hath found out to cover all their Cheats: But that my Bookseller hath limited my number of Sheets: Otherwise, I had furnish'd my self with the Knowledge of such things, that might be very acceptable to many; though, possible, offensive to some, who would not have their Hellish Contrivances , in their Trades, detected. But, however, I shall, at present, forbear. Only, this you must know in the Country of Commerce there are many Ale- houses ,    [   Ale-houses as they are managed by some now adayes; further Satan's Kingdom.  ] &c. yea, and a great Trade it is now adayes; and as well liked by our crafty Traveller , as any Calling in all the Country ; because it greatly tends (as 'tis managed by divers People) to the Support of the Interest of his Master Apollyon . It is an easie and lazy kind of Life; and yet, what Trade more gainful, than that of the Tap? Yet, let none suppose, we conclude 'tis not a lawful Imployment: No, no: Tis not against the Use of it, but the Abuse, of which we speak: 'Tis against such, who open their Doors to this Traveller , and draw in Poor Men to spend that little Money idly, they get by their Labor and Honest Endeavour ; whil'st their miserable Wives and Children want Bread at Home: Who suffer Coblers, Tinkers, Pedlars, Porters, Beggars , and all sorts of Trades and Professions, to sit Tippling all Day and Night; Singing and Dancing, nay, Cursing and Fighting too, or 'tis a wonder, (if they can stand:) And, in the mean time, the cunning Impostor is got to the Bar; being busie in Scoring, when there is no Calling. But this is but in one Room, you must know: For, in another, you may see a Company of Good Fellows at Cards, Dice ,  &c. for the last Half Dozen ; which is presently drawn, and set upon the Table; and they that are full of Coyn , draw; but they who have little, stand by and give Aim. They Shuffle and Cut on One side; the Dice Rattle on the Other. Long have they not play'd, but Oaths fly up and down like Hail-shot ; and if the poor dumb Dice are but a little out of the Square, with a thousand Plagues , perhaps, they are cast out of the Window; and may be, soon upon it, the Cards go after; or else condemn'd (as they deserve) to the Fire: Whil'st some of them fall down drunk under the Table. Sad it is to see, and hear, how Drunkenness , in every Land, aboundeth; few fearing the dreadful God , notwithstanding the amazing Judgments He often sends upon them: And much of this abominable Evil , to the Reproach of any Christian Kingdom , is occasion'd by the Ale-house- Keepers, Vintners and Brandy-sellers ,  &c. for many of these Traders live much upon the Sins of the other Inhabitants ; and 'tis a great shame to the Country of Commerce , to have them so numerous. But if the good Laws of this Land were put in due Execution (by All, as 'tis by Some, upon this Account; particularly, that of the First of King James ) against these Exorbitancies , it would soon make the Monster flie hence. Where it is Enacted, That whereas the antient, true and principal Use of Inns, Ale-houses, and Victualling-houses, was for the Receipt, Relief and Lodging of Wayfaring People ,  &c. and not to harbor Idle Fellows, to consume their Money: That for every Offence committed by any Inn-keeper, Ale- house-keeper, or Victualler, (the Offences are set down) should forfeit Ten Shillings to the Use of the Poor . Yet, nevertheless, nothing like Grace , these, and all other Sinners . But this is not the Way alone, by which this Town Morality is undone: Alas! Sin , and the Devil , have devis'd another, and that as dangerous as the Last, though it takes not so universally; viz. He deludes some of its Inhabitants with a strange Notion, as if it were as safe to dwell Here, as in the City of God ; and that Morality would, of it self, without Faith in Christ ,    [   Many make an Idol of Morality , by trusting to it for Life and Salvation.  ] carry them to Heaven . And thus, with plausible Pretences, he strives to perswade them to cast off the Satisfaction of Jesus , and to trust in their own Righteousness ; rendring Faith in Christ Crucified , little more than a Fancy; and that the main Design of his Coming into the World, was only to be a Pattern of Holiness, Patience and Humility . These to be seem very honest Men, but that Error, Ignorance, Self-Conceit , and Blindness of Mind , hath got such Rule in them: not regarding that Word, 145 Except your Righteousness exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise, enter into the Kingdom of God . For if a Man could be saved by his own Righteousness, Christ died in vain. Others he deludes so far, as to perswade them to exalt a certain Law of this Town, (I mean, the Light within ) above the Heavens ; and to make a Christ of it. And thus many simple-hearted People, who dwell Here, are ruin'd for ever, without the Infinite Mercy of God . As for Others, that dearly love the Town Morality , they come to see, by the Grace of God , that it's built, and stands near to mount Sinai ; from whence they hear such dreadful Thunder, that they have remov'd their Dwelling into the City of God ; where they,    [   Christianity without Morality nothing worth.  ] notwithstanding, keep up all the good Laws and Customs of this Place; knowing Christianity without Morality is worth nothing. Now Peccatum having done his worst in this Place, and almost quite ruin'd the Inhabitants, and left few of the Ancient Houses standing (and them so defac'd too, that now it may rather be call'd Immorality , than by the Name it was formerly known by) Travell'd further.  Shewing how Sin , alias, Ungodliness , came into the Great City Babylon ; and of the Mysterious Exploits and Mischievous Work he made there.  Visit an Ancient City , which above twelve hundred years ago he had Erected, after a new and mysterious Fashion, in the Confines of the vast Countrey ( Sensuality ) and 'tis called Great Babylon . Indeed it was high time for him to haste to this City ,    [   A Pardon for Sin in the City Babylon .  ] it being the only Place of Security for him; for here he may have a Pardon (they say) on easie Terms, for all the Villany that he has done. But before I proceed to speak of the Trade, Customs and Priviledges of this Great City , it may not be amiss to speak a little concerning the Situation of the Place, & c. Know then, That the Palace , or Chief Seat of the King of Babylon , is built upon seven Hills; where also hath been seven sorts of Governments. Also, by another Mark the City is distinguished from all other Cities in the World, viz. 'Tis said to Reign over the Kings of the Earth . 'Tis also called, The Mother-City , or Mother-Church ; for you must know 'tis a Spiritual City . Moreover, 'tis adorned with all manner of outward Pomp and Glory;  146 so that there is not the like Splendid Mystical City in the World; and yet it is the City of Confusion ; (as the Name of it signifies): And also called, A Great City : 1\. Great, in respect of Power;   [   In what sense Babylon is a great City.  ] which is twofold; First , Civil. Secondly , Ecclesiastical. 2\. Great, in respect of its innumerable Inhabitants. 3\. Great, in respect of its Fame, Riches, and the Merchandize thereof. 4\. Great, in Actions, vile Actions; such as Poysoning of Kings , and fomenting Jealousies, raising Wars ,  &c. 'Tis in this City , that the Blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jesus is found, which Tyrant Sin instigated the Inhabitants (both in former and later times) to shed in great  147 abundance; so that in every Street thereof the Blood, hath run down like a great Stream. As to the Foundation of it; It is (as they say) built upon St. Peter , not upon Christ ; and yet St. Paul saith,  148 Another Foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ . But is this City Babylon indeed built upon Peter? Upon his person it cannot; that is ridiculous to suppose: Upon his Doctrine Confession of Christ, and holy Example it is not; then it must be upon his Defection: You know he denied his Master. O! there the Foundation was laid;    [   Upon what foundation the City Babylon is built.  ] for the truth is, Apollyon and Sin raised this strange and mysterious Structure in the Ruines of the Outward Court of the Holy City ; and built it upon Apostacy, Heresie, Blasphemy, Usurpation, Judaism, Paganism, Imperious Decrees, Decretals, Canons, Ceremonies, Traditions, Superstitions and Unwritten Verities , or rather Very Lies . Moreover, the Walls of this City are strong;    [   What the Walls of Great Babylon are.  ] which are these following, viz. 1. Ignorance. 2. Atheism. 3. Sensual Pleasures, Honours, Riches. 4. Pardons, Absolutions, Indulgence, Inquisition. 5. Blood, Massacres, Persecution, Cruelties, Fire and Sword ,  &c. 6. Civil, Ecclesiastical , and Universal Power , or pretended Supremacy over Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles, Churches , and all Nations and People of the Earth. 7. Infallibility . 'Tis needful also for you to know, That Peccatum hath much Work to do in this Place; for as he (by subtil and mysterious Working and Aid he had from Apollyon ) did first erect it; so doth he still uphold, strengthen and repair it: for it hath in these latter times gone somewhat to decay, by means of the great Wars that have been made against it by the Lamb and his Followers . Now, that which Sin by Craft and Subtilty , hath done to raise its Fame, and enlarge its Borders, was,    [   Peccatum works Miracles in the City Babylon .  ] partly the great Miracles (it is said) he wrought in the midst of it to deceive the poor, ignorant and blind Inhabitants, which indeed were the strangest that ever were heard of in the World: But that which spoils all, is the Epithete the Holy Apostle gives them, viz. by calling them Lying Signs and Wonders ; yet since our Traveller is a Worker of Miracles, is it meet he should lose so great a part of his Glory? I shall, to prevent it, give you therefore a hint or two of some of them, which he is now come again to confirm the People in the Faith and stedfact Belief of. One Becanus's Head being off, this Miracle-Worker so assisted St. Itas in Prayer, that She made it come posting through the Air, and stand by the Body; and She soon joyned them fast again, so that the Man, in one hours space, became as lively as ever he had been in all his Life. St. Anthony's Arm, that precious Relick at Geneva , was (by the instigation of Mighty Peccatum ) kiss'd an worshipp'd with great Devotion, whilst the Religion of this City kept its ground there; but when the Gospel came to be preached,    [   Calv. De Reliq. prop. initium.  ] the Relick was produced, and was found to be the Pizzle of a Stag. Possibly you have heard of the Wonders that Relick had done; and of St. Decumanus , who carried his own Head after it was cut off, to a Spring, and there washed off the Blood from it. And another also this monstrous Lyar made to carry his Head when off, under his Arm two or three Miles. 'Tis said he taught St. Runnald , alias Rumwald , assoon as ever he came out of his Mothers Womb, to cry aloud three times, I am a Christian ; then making a plain Confession of his Faith, he desired to be Baptized, chose his Godfathers, and told them what his Name should be, & c. A Countrey- Curate ,  149 saith Erasmus , getting Crabs (being a Fish so call'd) and fastning Candles to their backs, set them a crawling up and down the Church-yard at night, and in the Morning this Deceiver bid the Curate perswade the People that they were poor distressed Souls in Purgatory:  150 you must think (saith my Author) they were such that wanted Masses and Alms; ye know the Proverb, No Peny, no Pater noster ; a fit Miracle to pick the Peoples Pockets. The Wife of one Elypidius , having three Children all dead at once, came to St. Hylarion , to pray him in the Name of Jesus Christ to raise them to Life again: At first he was not willing to come out of his Cell; but she falling down prostrate, or flat to the ground, began to cry, Hylarion, Raise my Children by thy Prayers ; that at last he was constrained to go and see the Children, who were all cold, & c. But he in the presence of a great multitude of People, made his Prayers so devoutly, that immediately they were brought to life, and cast abundance of Water out of their Mouths, and knew their Father and Mother. A Gentlewoman of England , in one of the years of Jubilee , travelled to Rome , to Father Parsons , who was her Confessor; and he administring unto her the Sacrament; which in the form of a little Wafer, he put into her Mouth, and observed she was long a chewing, and could not swallow the same: Whereupon, he ask'd her, Whether she knew what she had received? She answered, Yes, a Wafer . At which, Father Parsons being much offended, thrust his Finger into her Mouth, and thence drew out a piece of red Flesh; which was after nail'd against a Post in a Vesprey or Private Chappel . And though it was done many years ago,    [   A strange Popish Miracle. ] yet doth (saith my Author) That piece of Flesh remain to be seen fresh and red as ever it was. I could cite Multitudes , and some as strange as these, which this subtil Deceiver hath done, to cheat the silly People. Have you not heard of St. Winifred , a Welch Lady , who had vow'd Virginity , and was unhappily woo'd by a King's Son, who was so hot in his Suit, that she was forc'd to make her escape; but he overtook her, and like a Barbarous Clown cut off her Head; and in the Spot where it fell to the ground, there immediately sprang up a Well , which to this day (they say) is famous amongst Welsh Catholicks , for no body knows how many Cures and Miracles; but the head leaves the Body behind it, and trudges on to the Church, and came in amongst the People, where St. Benno was going to say Mass: The Man of God seeing this (tho' 'tis like the People were amazed) seeks the Murtherer, and finds him wiping his bloody Sword upon the Grass, he pronounces his Curse against him; who immediately fell down dead: And St. Benno often kissing the Head, joyn'd it to the Body, and covers it with his Mantle, and away goes to the Altar to say Mass; which done, to the Body he returns, and makes a Sermon, then prays for the Virgin; whereunto all the People said, Amen ; presently the Virgin riseth up as if she had been asleep all this while, wipes her Face from Dust, Blood and Sweat, and goes to Church to return thanks, and lived (if you will believe it) fifteen years after this was done; only in her neck, where her Head had been cut off, there was a Circle, like a white Thred, all her Life-time. What Miracles stranger than these were ever heard of which this Wonder-working Tyrant , and Soul-Murderer, hath done in this City?   [   The strange mysterious Doctrines that Peccatum teaches in the City Babylon .  ] But this is not all his Business in this place; for he is employed by Apollyon to teach and instruct the good People in many Strange and Mysterious Articles of Faith , that so he may appear a compleat Mystery of Iniquity : Some of which here follow; 1\. That the Inhabitants may Swear, Lie, nay, and Forswear themselves (if it be to promote the Good of Holy Church ) and yet be True Men . 2\. They may contrive Rebellions, Murthers and Treasons, and yet be as Innocent as the Child unborn . 3\. They may be filled with, and make a Trade of Excess and Drunkenness , and yet be the Patterns of Sobriety and Temperance . 4\. To commit gross Idolatry , and yet the true Worshippers of God. 5\. to commit Fornication and Adultery , and yet be spotless, and pure in Heart, and good Catholicks . 6\. He teaches the King of Babylon to elevate (himself to the highest Pinacle of Pride) even above Emperors, Kings and Princes; nay above Jesus Christ and God the Father ; and yet to be so humble, meek and lowly-minded, as to be content to be called The Servant of Servants . 7\. To cast the Truth to the ground, deface Gods Law, and burn the Holy Bible, and yet be The True Witnesses to it, and maintainers of it. 8\. To foment Wars and Broils in most Nations, and contrive the Ruine of many Kingdoms by Fire, Sword and cruel Devastations, and yet be as harmless as Doves to all Mankind. 9\. To slaughter, kill, and barbarously murther Men, Women and Children, that dare not be so wicked and blasphemous as themselves, and yet be full of Mercy, tender Pity and Compassion, as an Apostle, Shepherd, Vicar and Successor of the Meek, and Lamb-like Jesus . 10\. For a People to be confederate, and joyn in with, and be guilty of all these unparallell'd Villanies and rapacious Murthers, and yet be The holy Catholick Church of God, the pure and spotless Spouse of Christ, his Harmless Lambs , the only Orthodox Christians , and True Followers of the Primitive Saints . 11\. To say, the Church cannot Err , tho' God and all the World knows there are not such Great Errors in Principles, nor like Enormities, cursed Actions, cruel and immoral Practices in the world. 12\. But the greatest Mystery of all,   [   What words the Priest uses in that they rall Transubstantiation .  ] Peccatum teaches their Priests, by a strange Charm of five Latin words, i. e. Hoc est enim Corpus meum , to transubstantiate a Wafer-Cake into the Real Body and Blood of Jesus Christ; and this Breaden-God the Inhabitants eat, even Flesh, Blood and Bones, and so like strange Cannibals , devour their Maker ; and though it be utterly against Reason, and contradicted by all the five Senses, as well as Scripture, yet it must be acknowledged to be nothing else than what we before asserted; and those who will not believe it so to be, and adore it with the highest degree of Divine Worship, which is proper to God only, must be Anathematized, if not burned at a Stake. Thus, in brief, you may see what strange and mysterious Doctrines this Hellish Monster teaches in this City , that so he may appear to all to be a cunning Artist, and hath got the Knack exactly to make up the Mystery of Iniquity compleat. I had thought to have mentioned some of the Principles , he besides these, teaches in this City ; but they are so well known, I will pass them by. But in the next place, you must know,    [   A Market kept in the City Babylon .  ] That here is also a Market kept every day in the week; where there are many choice Commodities sold: And indeed never did Peccatum come to a better Town; for, out of infinite kindness and love to him, for all the good Services he has done them, they have provided here on easie terms a Pardon for him, that so he may proceed on in his Travels, and fear no Colours. The Merchandize that is to be had in this City, are very rich; as you have them laid down in Holy Scripture viz. The Merchandize of Gold and Silver , 151 Precious Stones, Pearls, Fine Linnen, Purple, Silk, Scarlet, and all Sweet Wood, with all manner of Vessels Ivory, and all manner of Vessels of precious Wood, and of Brass, Iron and Marble, and Cinamon, Odors, Oyntments,, Frankincense, Wine, fine Flower, Wheat, Beasts, Sheep, Horses, Chariots, Slaves, and Souls of Men ,  &c. If you do but observe the last Commodity, you cannot but say they trade in things of great worth; for what is more precious than the Souls of Men ? ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 152 which here are sold at an easie Rate; as will appear by the next sort of Wares exposed to Sale, to bear up the Spirits of our unweary Traveller, viz. Here is to be had that Staple Commodity of the whole City Babylon , viz. Pardons and Indulgences of all sorts and sizes for all and all manner of sins of whatsoever shape, scantling or complexion they be (on easie terms) whether past, present, or to come; also a certain Release for Souls that have long lain in the scorching Flames of Purgatory , till their Skins be shriveled, and as black of Complexion as a Westphalia Gammon. Moreover,   [   If any desire to know the exact Price of Pardons or Dispensations for Murders , of all sorts, Parricides, Perjuries, Adulteries, Incest, Buggery, and all other Sins, let them see a Book lately Written by Anthony Egan, late a Franciscan Fryer in Ireland, but now of the Reformed Religion, Entituled, Certain Decreed Impositions of the Chancery-Court of the Church of Rome; none hardly amounting to more than six or eight pounds, and some under Twenty shillings, and others not above sixpence.  ] at this Fair or Market are rare Shows or Sights to be seen; yea, such Rarities that the world cannot afford the like; viz. Part of the Cross on which our Saviour was crucified; the Tayl of the Ass on which he rode to Jerusalem; great store of the Virgin Maries Milk ; also, the very Thred, Work- Basket, Scissars and Needles which she used in making Christ's Seamless Coat: Moreover, Monks Hoods , and Fryars Cowls , in which, whosoever dies, shall fly bolt upright into Heaven, if you believe what Popish Merry-Andrews tell you: With multitudes of such like Knick-knacks and Curiosities. Whatever your Fancy is, here you may please it, if you have Money. Now these Pardons and Indulgences, have, I hear, so flusht the cruel Monster, that he takes fresh Heart and Courage at every turn to attempt all manner of Villanies whatsoever;    [   Cruel Torments inflicted on Gods People by the Papists .  ] and from hence has devised the most inhumane and exquisite Tortures and Torments for all Hereticks, that ever was heard of in the world; as Flaying alive, roasting alive, hanging persons by the Bowels on a Beam, hanging by the hair of the head, by one Leg, by the Toes, hanging on Tenters, Sawing to death, &c.  If Rome can pardon Sins, as Romans hold; And if those Pardons can be bought and sold, Were it a Sin to adore and worship Gold? If they can purchase Pardons with a Sum, For Sins they may commit in time to come, And for Sins past , who would not hast to Rome ? But Oh the Plaguy thing of being poor! For is it not a lamentable story For want of Gold, to lie for evermore In Hell, or at the least in Purgatory? Out of which Place can never come the Poor ; No nor the Rich without they'l waste their store. Lastly, You must know that Peccatum hath learned the Inhabitants of this Great City , the rare Art and Mystery of Equivocation ; by which he is had in great veneration amongst them. Some of his Skil herein I might shew you (but that it is, needless it being largely done by others.) By this means he wonderfully keeps up their Credit, and maintains the Trade of the City. Also he hath made them meer Monsters like himself, in the Hellish Art of unparallel'd Blasphemy . Besides, he is, you must know, a rare Politician , being the chief Agent , to carry on, and contrive all the dark and bloody Intrigues of State amongst them. But since I hear he is very busie in this place to stir up, and push on another great War against the Holy Seed , and City of God , we will at present say no more of his Wonders and strange Projects here; but follow him in his Travels , touching his carrying on of his next Grand Enterprize . But to revive the Hearts of such who love Zion ; this let me note by the way; ( i.e. ) 'tis not doubted by most of the Faithful ,    [   The Fall of Babylon near.  ] but that the Fall and utter Overthrow of Babylon is at hand; and then shall Zion be delivered: and the same hour there was a great Earthquake ,  153 and the tenth part of the City fell; when she saith in her Heart, I sit a Queen, and shall see no sorrow, nor have loss of Children any more; then in an hour shall her Judgments come upon her .  Shewing how Peccatum , alias Ungodliness , came against the Town of Religion (otherwise called Sion, or the City of God ) with a great Army of a mixt People, and besieged it. Moreover, how he met with True Godliness , and a Noble Citizen of Mount Zion, called Thoughtful; and what Discourse past between them: With the strange, Politick, and bloody Stratagems the Tyrant used to destroy the Holy City: Together with a Compendious Description of the Situation, Foundation, Trade, and Privileges thereof; and by what means it holds out against all the Powers of Darkness.  Matters pretty well in Great Babylon , ranged about, and destroyed wonderfully in every Kingdom and Nation; neither did he spare any, where, either by force or fraud he could prevail; pitying no Sex, nor Degree of People, High nor Low, Noble nor Ignoble, Rich nor Poor, Old nor Young; for such is his Impudence , that he assaults the Prince upon Throne , as well as the Beggar on the Dunghil ; insomuch, that he (as it is said) hath got strange Footing, or Entertainment in the Courts of Emperors ,  &c. and many other mighty Potentates of the Earth, alluring them by his Policy, to take up Arms for him; and having by this means gathered together a vast and prodigious Army, resolved to enter upon his last grand and main Enterprize, which was, to besiege, attack, utterly raze and lay desolate the Holy City ; which, by gracious Providence, hath, in these latter times, been rebuilt, & c. And now you must know, that this Army doth consist of, or is made up with People of divers Nations; as, Turks, Tartars, Mahometans, Babylonians, Atheists , and a Multitude besides, brought out of the great Countrey and City Sensuality , with another sort of dangerous Enemies; of which we shall speak more hereafter. Never was Peccatum and Ungodliness   [   Peccatum mounted. Great Wars against the City of God .  ] raised up to higher Pomp and Grandeur than he seems at this time; for lo, now he is mounted an Horse-back, and Crowned with Bays, as a glorious Conqueror, leading the numerous Hosts, like a victorious General, or Commander in chief, under Apollyon , King of the Bottomless Pit ; having Thousands of Thousands following him, with great Shouts, Musick of all sorts, and loud Acclamations; crying, Great is Diana of the whole World . Now as touching the Martial or Warlike Order they Marched in, against Mount Sion ; take this briefly: Peccatum led the Van (being himself more than an hundred Thousand strong.) Next to him. Marcht Apollyon , Mighty Beelzebub , and Lucifer , heading three great Armies, compos'd of different kinds; yet all cruel Enemies to this City . The first consisted of the Riches of this World ; by which Thousands have fallen. The second, of Honours and Sinful Preferments . The third was filled up with Vain Delights and Pleasures . They are also called by three other Names ,  154 viz. The Lust of the Eyes, the Lust of the Flesh , and the Pride of Life . After these, followed a man (if we may call him so) adorned in Cloth of Gold , with a Triple Crown on his Head, and for a Scepter ,    [   The Pope and Turk , though at War one with the other, yet like Herod and Pilate , both can agree to crucifie Jesns Christ .  ] a Brace of Keys in his Hand; who I take to be the Great King of Babylon ; with a glorious Retinue of Cardinals, Patriarchs, Bishops, Abbots, Friars, Monks, Nuns, Seminaries, Jesuites , and a number more following him; with a great Train of Artillery ; as, Merit of Works, Limbus, Purgatory, Pardons, Indulgences, Vows, Prayers to, and for the Dead, Penance, Holy Water, Pilgrims, Auricular Confession, Extream Unction, Lamps, Candles, Torches , Tapers, Relicks, Oyl, Salt, Spittle, Crucifixes Beads, Holy Garments, Signs, Gestures,, Canons, Customs , and the Lord knows what besides; as, Blood, Slaughter, Massacres, Stake, Fire and Sword . Then came the Grand Seignior , or the proud and blasphemous Emperor of Turke , attended with his chief Mufti , and a multitude of other inferior Priests , with their Alcoran in their hands, and a great Army at their heels, with Swords , and other slaughtering Weapons , swearing by their Beards , what they will do to such that oppose them; being all true Sons and Vassals to Apollyon , and this Dreadful Enemy Peccatum . And then after these, an Army of fair Ladies , drest up in sumptuous Apparel, and in the newest Mode the City Sensuality hath of late found out; as, spotted Faces, naked Breasts and Shoulders . And with them a number of Debauched Lads out of Youth-shire , Armed Cap-a-pe ; being as true as Steel to the Interest of their beloved Leader , and very expert in all stratagems of War against God, Christ , and True Godliness . Moreover, besides these, a bloody and treacherous Brigade, who lie in secret Ambuscado , who are as dangerous as any of the rest, called Inbrd corruption . In the Reer marched two Regiments: The first was made vp of a base sort of Varlets, called Renegadoes, i.e. being such who having deserted the Lord Jesus Christ , and the Holy City , and joyned in with the Enemy, who are become as cruel Adverries as any in the world. The last was a Regiment of strange People, hardly two of them being alike, and their Manners and Customs were as various; They came out of a Town which lies on one side of the City of God , call'd Heresie ; and therefore may fitly be termed Erroneous and Seditious Sectaries ; being rotten at heart, and corrupt in the Fundamentals of the True Christian Religion ; holding almost every abominable Principle that hath been broached by the Devil in any Age of the Church, & c. Thus War being proclaimed, and all the Forces of Hell and Darkness Mustered, a Councel was called, to consult about the best Expedients to carry it on: And there being neither Power nor Policy wanting, what can we think should be the Issue of it, but Ruine and Slaughter to the Holy Seed ? Now the great Design on foot,   [   The Grand Design of Satan, is, to overcome by subtil Temptations.  ] 'tis thought is how to kill the Witnesses : But Apollyon judg'd it fit at this Juncture, to send Peccatum , as a subtil Spy , into the City first, to see if he could by Treachery get the Gates open to his Armies, & c. The Instructions he received, were as follows; Apollyon . Dear Peccatum , Though our Armies are ready, and all things promise fair, yet great part of the Work will lie upon Thee and I; and indeed thou must now therefore bestir thee; for the Inhabitants of this City are many of them expert in War, and are not ignorant our Devices;    [   Diabolical Policy discovered.  ] therefore this must be done: First , Let's chuse Advantageous Seasons to assault them. Secondly , Manage our Arms in such Methods that suit best with our Craft and Policy. Thirdly , Pitch on fit Instruments to carry on our Design . I. As to proper and advantageous Seasons , this is that which gives facility and speedy dispatch to a Business. I have often took men here,  155 because they know not their Time : A small Strength will do at one time, that a far greater cannot at another. 1\. Therefore, When any are newly wrought upon by the Grace of God , or a new Convert is made, then bestir thy self; for indeed the Cry of the New Creature gives whole Legions of us Devils an Alarm: Alas! their Strength then is weak; see if you can lead him into Error , or puff him up with Pride , or drive him into Despair , by laying before him his former evil Life. 2\. When we see any attended with great Afflictions; this is like a blind solitary Lane where we as Thieves may easily beset them; when they are robb'd of all their worldly Comforts, let's tempt them to impatience, and to conclude God hath forsaken them, and then their business is done; when the City wants Provision, or is greatly straitned, then let us sound a Parley. 3\. When they are about some notable Enterprize for God's Glory, then thou must be as an Adder in the path, that biteth the Horse heels ,  156 so that the Rider shall fall backward . Thus I hindred Joshuah , by holding his right hand, which is the working hand: We must prevent that Enterprize by raising up some difficulty or another. 4\. When they are in the presence of some fit Object, to enforce our Temptation, that's our time: Thus I caught Eve , when she was near the Tree, and had the Fruit thereof before her Eyes. 5\. When they are asleep, idle, or off their Watch, thats our time; doubt not but this way we may surprize the City, and their Souls too with much ease; for thus Thou and I overcome David and the Foolish Virgins, &c. 6\. We must beset them after great manifestations of God's Love to them;   [ Some Christians can neither bear Gods Frowns nor Smiles.  ] for they shall neither be able to bear well his Frowns, nor his Smiles, if we can help it; for we may make the one like to warm Gleams, to bring up the Weeds of Corruption, and the other like sharp Frost, to nip and kill the Bud of their Hopes, Grace and great Expectation. 7\. Let us come upon them when they seem secure, flourishing in the midst of Peace, Plenty and Prosperity; for that way we destroyed the Children of Israel , when they came into the Land of Canaan , and Thousands more in every Nation. 8\. 'Tis good to assault them before they have learned the crafty use of their Arms; an unexperienced Soldier is soon brought under. 9\. We must be sure to come upon them in the night of God's Withdrawings: when their General is absent, let us be present; when he hides his Face, we will soon shew our Heads. 10\. Lastly, At their dying hour; for if we cannot do our Work before, let us strive to do it then; for this is the last Cast for the Game: Now or Never. II. We must use our utmost Craft in managing our Assaults.   [   Satan's Policy in managing his Assaults.  ] Therefore, 1\. Let us find out their natural Inclinations and Dispositions, and suit our Baits accordingly: Where the walls of the City are weakest we must raise our Batteries: Thou maist easily get in at one place, when thou canst not at another. I need say no more; observe this well. 2\. As need shall require, hang out false Colours, and pretend to be as much for Real Sanctity , as the best of them; but when all is done, cause them to relie upon it; for this way they'l become over-righteous , and so destroy themselves.  157 3\. We must continually get intelligence of their Affairs, where-e'er they be, or whatsoever they are about: Let our Eyes be upon them at home or abroad; so that nothing may be wanting on our parts, at any occasion to help on their Commission of Evil , nor Omission of Good ; That which seems a Mole-hill in the way of their Duty, let us make a Mountain ; if we can keep them from their Temple , we may soon bring them to our Synagogue . 4\. Let us make our Approaches gradually ; We must not ask too much at first; a few may be let into the City, when a great Army cannot; thou maist perswade them to go with thee a mile or two, tho not to the end of thy Journey; shew them first the Object , and afterwards tempt them to Desire ; thou maist get in thy Foot , where thou canst not get in thy Head . 5\. We must (if possible) Unarm them; however, take away their Sword , though we cannot their Shield ; so that they may not wound our Friends, though we cannot slay them. Our Babylonian-Army are excellent Artists at this sort of fighting; if they can but enter the City, they'l soon rid their hands of this Weapon, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   God's Word.  ] so that they shall never cut their fingers more with it; in the mean time, we must render it insufficient, or blunt the edge as much as may be, and magnifie the Light within , or Unwritten Traditions , above it, that it may do the less Mischief. 6\. Let us sometimes Retreat in Policy, when we are in a fair way to get the Victory.    [   Satan cares not though the Act of Sin be left, if the Habit be retained.  ] We Unclean Spirits sometimes seem to go out of Men , when our Design is to return seven times stronger than before; if thou canst but perswade them to love thee, I am content they should in part leave thee; for I had rather see thee in their Affections, than in their Conversations. 7\. We must never raise our present Siege , till we have starved them: No better way in the world to deal with these Enemies, than to cut off Provisions, and other Recruits from coming to them. 8\. Let us destroy (if possible) their bold Leaders (who so oft sallie out of the City upon us) and either by Force or Flattery bring them to lay down their Arms, and then the rest will be afraid; when the Pillars fall, the House will follow. 9\. 'Tis one great part of thy Work to endeavour to break their Ranks, and put them into Disorder; for then thou wilt with ease conquer. 10\. Also cause some of them to lagg behind, or straggle from their Colours, and not regard the sound of the Trumpet, neither call no Alarm ; for such will quickly become a prey to us. 11\. But above all things (if possible) spoil that Plaguy Engine that malls us so fearfully; I mean Prayer and Fasting ; lets do what we can to make that of little Use, or keep them ignorant of the damnable hurt it hath done us; or blind their Eyes, that they may not know how to mount it upon the Wheels of Faith ; or else quench the Spirit , which should give Fire to it. 12\. Do also what thou canst to force them to Mutiny ; if we can divide them, we shall soon devour them; and indeed we have pretty well herein succeeded already. III,   [   Satan seeks to make use of fit Instruments to entice to Evil. ] We must make use of fit Instruments to carry on our Designs against them. 1\. We must employ Men of Parts and Policy ; who have depth of Reason to argue them out of their Religion. A bad Cause, Peccatum , needs a smooth Orator. Alexander the Coppersmith (of old) did me much good; I matter not what harm a Paul sustaineth. 2\. Let us set on some grave, wise and old Apostates to attaque them; for hardly better Champions, nor truer Drudges have we to do this Service for us in all our Armies. 3\. We must look out some rare Wits , that are well skill'd in the Art of Calumniation , to load them with Reproach and Infamy, to render them odious to the Vulgar , and thereby hinder others from Siding with them; we have whole Regiments of these Boys at hand, 4\. Make use of a Husband, a Wife, a Landlord, or such like Persons, to allure them to our Party; for they (doubtless) will have the greatest influence upon them, & c. The Hellish Lecture being ended, the Tyrant hasted towards the City; but lo, before he came very near, he chanced to hear several People enquire the way to it. one cry'd, Which is the Way ? and another, Which is the Way? O how may I find (said they) the City of God! At last this cursed Traveller perceiving    [   How Sin deludes some poor unwary Enquirers after the Way to Sion  ] his Prey, went to some of them, and told them he could direct them: For (said he) I have often been at this City, and know the way very well . But the base Villain, instead of directing them into the right Way, he set them in a broad Road, which at last brought them into the Great City Babylon; Some others also he sent into By-Paths , that led them into that pernicious and blasphemous Town , called Errour and Heresie ; and there those poor deluded Souls have liv'd ever since, and take that Place to be the Holy City ; but at last up comes one boldly by him, who seemed to have the perfect knowledge of the Way; and the cruel Monster seeing him, endeavoured to turn him back, by laying many sad Discouragements before him: But Apollyon presently whispered the Tyrant in the Ear to let him alone; I know (said he) this Person well enough; he will do our Interest no harm, by entring in ;    [   Satan sends some as Spies into the Holy City .  ] he is a Spy that I have sent to betray the Place, by bringing Intelligence to our Army ,  &c. After him, came another; but Apollyon cry'd, Let him go into the Town; for I perceive he bears the World on his back, and hath also a secret Love and Liking to thee too; 'tis only a troublesome Fellow , ( one Conscience) that hath scar'd him to flee from the Wrath to come, or else the Fool would have a Name ,  &c. 'Tis somewhat of such a nature that causes him to seek a Dwelling here; for his Will and Affections stand true and firm to us; and let me tell thee, he will e'er long haste as fast out of this City as now he seems to hasten into it; and then we shall gain by this means exceedingly . For first ,   [   The great evil and danger of Apostacy laid open.   ] If he deserts Religion , and flies out of the City of God , he will rejoyce all our good Friends; and open their Mouths wide against all the Inhabitants of this Place: For we will make them conclude, and swear too, that all the rest are like him, viz. Carnal and Covetous Persons , and such who love the World above Christ . Secondly , If he returns back into the City Sensuality , he will thereby declare, that the Pleasures, Honours and Riches of this World are better things, and rather to be chosen, than whatsoever he could find in the City of God; or if he go into the City Babylon , it will be of like importance to us, and as much for our advantage every way. Thirdly , By this act of his, we shall stumble divers Souls who have thoughts to go thither, and utterly stifle their convictions in respect of Duty and Obedience to the Laws and Statutes of that Place. Fourthly , It will wound and grieve the Hearts of our Enemies (the Inhabitants I mean of Mount Zion .) Fifthly , It will weaken their Hands too, and so make the Place the more easie to be taken; for there is (I must tell it between thee and I) Multitudes of this sort of Cartel got in among them,   [   Many Hypocrites in Gods Church.   ] that I shall make the City too hot for, e'er I have done. Sixthly , This will cause Religion , also, it self to become very contemptible. Seventhly , Hereby he will (which is more than all) dishonour God; and cause him to cast him off for ever. Eighthly , And so we shall devour him, and all such at our pleasure. Ninthly , And then hereby he will wound his own Soul; and be set in the ready road to sin the unpardonable Sin , which we cannot cause everyone to commit. Tenthly , and lastly , It will also greatly rejoyce all us Devils; for we love to see Mankind guilty of our Sin , which was Apostacy , and so fall under our Condemnation: And indeed, there is nothing like this makes them more conformable to our Image: At the hearing of these things, the treacherous Monster let the Man go quietly in. But behold, on a sudden came another who had an honest heart, whose Name was Neophitus :    [   A young Christian.  ] But O how did he bestir himself to block up his way; so that he was at amaze, and greatly fear'd he should never find the City; but whilst he was looking this way and that way, seeing many cross turnings, he saw two or three Men acoming towards him; and Peccatum , alias Ungodliness , was by him all the while; now as God would have it who should these be, but True Godliness , ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   Ungodliness and True Godliness , meet and confer together.  ] Theologue , with most Noble and Renowned Thoughtful ; who were come, it seems, to direct poor Strangers the ready way to the City: Now Godliness perceiving the poor young Christian amaz'd, asked him what he ailed; Ah Sir, said he, I would fain go to Mount Zion , that Holy City; and here is a Traveller that has so confounded me, that I cannot find the way to it; with that the Heavenly Prince being full of Holy Zeal, cast an angry look upon the Monster , and spoke to this purpose; O full of all Subtilty and all Mischief; thou Child of the Devil; thou Enemy of all Righteousness; wilt thou not cease to pervert the right Ways of God? I have heard of you in my Travels ; and have I now met with you? I shall tell you News will make you tremble before I leave you. Ungodli. Sir, you seem very hot, and have not lost your spirit I perceive, though you have met with no better Entertainment abroad where you have been. Godliness . I thought how you would insult over me; you shew from whence you proceed; Sir, it has been through your deluding and ensnaring Wills that I have been so slighted: You and your Hellish Master have put me into such a Disguise, that most of the Inhabitants of the Earth do not know me;    [ True Godliness abominably abused.  ] besides, you have put out all their Eyes, & fill'd their Hearts with bitter Enmity against me; but do not suppose I am therefore discouraged, or think the worse of my self; for I have met with as good usage as my Master Christ did when he lived here on the Earth. I do not doubt but you have met with Entertainment to your Masters Content. Ungodli. Troth friend, thou saist right,    [   All the World in love with Sin .  ] all the World is in love with me; and their Doors are wide open to me where ever I come; and doth this grieve you? Godli. It would be strange should I rebuke your swearing and vain- glorying , sith you are such a foul Monster , that is made up of every Sin , being the very Essence of Wickedness and Transgression ; but do not wonder if I am troubled to hear of your great success in your Soul- undoing-Travels . Oh! my Bowels, my Bowels! poor Mortals what have they done. Ungodli. you want I believe a Cordial ; the News I tell you, I see makes you sick, but pray blame me not: Why should not I be as true to the Interest of my great Master, as you are to yours: Sir, I cannot do otherwise. Godli. I know indeed your Nature is such, that if you should cease serving Apollion , your Hellish Prince and Sovereign , you would cease your self, or lose your very Being: But this will not serve your turn. Ungodli. I know not what you mean; but if you please, let us discourse a little about our Travels ; What may the reason be that I am so generally embraced, and you slighted, Godli.   [   Why is Sin so generally embraced, and Godliness hated.  ] I have given two Reasons of it already, and for the sake of this poor young Christian that is by, I will discover other Causes and Grounds of it. First , 'Tis because you seek in all your Travels how to please and gratifie the Flesh , and I contrariwise teach them to crucifie the Flesh,  158 and keep it under, and make no provision for it, to fulfil the Lusts thereof . 2\. You teach men to mind the good only of their Bodies, and never regard their Souls; nay, make them think (if you could) they have no Souls at all to mind: But I tell them they must prefer the Good and Well-being of their Souls, a thousand times above any thing they judge may be for the Delight or Profit of the outward Man;  159 because 'tis worth more than all the World . 3\. 'Tis because you, by the help from your Master and their own deceitful hearts, have made more Brutes of Millions of them, as if they were created for no other end, than to please their sensual Appetites. 4\. 'Tis because the Presents you offer to them, agree and suit so well with their evil and depraved Natures, which can only favour such things; but my Dainties none can relish, but by Faith , which only belongs to the New Creature . 5\. 'Tis because your things are present things, to be had and enjoyed now; but the best things that I offer them, are not to be had till hereafter. 6\. In a word, 'tis because you have so hardened their Hearts, and blinded their Minds, by appearing to them in such a false and treacherous Disguise, that they, (poor Creatures) generally take you to be a Friend, tho' the worst Enemy to them under the Heavens, designing nothing less than to destroy and damn their Souls for ever. 7\. Lastly, 'Tis because my blessed Sovereign, hath for Reasons best known to himself, finding them so evil, hid the things of which I speak, from the greatest part of mankind,  160 and only revealed them to a few. Ungodli.   [   Satan hath put True Godliness into a Disguise or frightful Visard.  ] I am glad you have no more to say, you Enemy of Hell; I see how odious you render me; what I have done I will still do, and under the same Disguise I have appeared I will appear; and I have troth put you into a Disguise too, and could tell you, fool, that this is one reason you are entertained by no more; I have put you into a Seditious, Factious, Ignominious, Contemptible and Melancholly One ; and in it I will keep you in spite of your teeth, do your worst, Sir; I regard you not, since I am beloved by Emperors and mighty Potentates of the Earth: I shall never be without Credit, and whilst I have so many wise and learned ones to plead for me and take my part, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) I warrant you I shall make your company thin enough; if that won't do, you know I have another way to deal with your Favorites; my Slaughtering Boyes and Weapons are ready for them, and though you think 'tis like to get this Youngster out of my Clutches, you will find your self mistaken; for I, in the face you and your two Champions, will shew you some of my skill. Godli. Silence your blasphemous Tongue, I will try a Bout with you, and it shall cost me my Life, and the Life of my two Servants, but we will safely conduct this honest Soul to the City of God. Ungodli.   [   A great Combat between a young Christian and Sinful Temptations. Gods Word the only Guid to Sion . The true way to Sion opened. ] Hey Boys up go we , By mighty Beelzebub , I'll to't then; come doubtful Soul, be wise and venture no further; don't you see how many cross wayes and turnings there be, & c. Neop. I am at a loss indeed, but I hate you, for what I have heard now from you. Godli. Child, here is a blessed Directory for thee, that shews thee the way plainly (with that he put a Bible into his hand) and Theologue opened the meaning, and gave him the true sense of it, so that he plainly; saw that the way, more generally, was Christ himself as Mediator. 1. As a Priest, to die for him, to appease the wrath of God, and satisfie Justice. 2. As a King, to subdue this Tyrant Sin , and to rule in him, and reign over him, according to those holy and wholsome Laws and Ordinances, contained in that Book (which he held in his hand) 3. As a Prophet, to teach and instruct him 4. As a holy Example or Pattern to imitate and follow. But more particularly he saw the way into the City was by Repentance Faith, and Obedience, & c. then he rejoyc'd and praised God. Ungodl. . Do you rejoyce, Friend? I will assure you, your danger is great, if you go further; for there are mighty Armies coming against this City. Godli. Do not regard him in this thing, Who can harm thee if thou be a Follower of that which is good? 161 They can't take away thy God nor thy Christ; no, nor thy Peace: the same troubles and dangers attended those Saints who are now shining and triumphing in Heaven,    [   True-Godliness refels all sinful Temptations.  ] and that power that help'd them is ingaged for thee; besides, thy trouble and dangers here are but for a moment, they will soon be over, but if thou wilt seek to save thy life and escape them, thou wilt lose thy life, and be exposed to eternal death and danger in Hell; besides, thy profit will be more than thy loss; Godliness with Contentment is great gain ; nay, and let me tell thee, 162 The City has been besieged near this Six thousand years, and yet it holds out still; do not fear, for God hath promised to be a Wall of Fire round about it. 163 Neop. Come Sir, let's go. Ungodli. Go, you are not mad, are you? Some thousands of people have disserted the City: and this a time to go thither? Godli. It was so, because they were never quite out of love with this vile monster Sin ,    [   The cause of Apostacy.  ] nor throughly Converted; but hark, because Demas leaves this City, must Paul do so too? or because many forsook Christ, and walked no more with him, shall his holy Apostles forsake him? Or because the greatest part of the World go in at the Broad Gate, wilt not thou go in at the straight? Neop. God forbid, Sir, this Fellow is I see a Deceiver. Ungodli. Don't abuse me, I am thy Friend, and would have thee pity thy self; for this City no man regardeth. Godli. You are none of his Friend, but contrariwise his Enemy and a Murderer: Poor Soul, this is the same that was said of Zion of old time. Ungodli. The Laws and Ordinances, Friend, are very hard and difficult to keep. Godli.   [   Christs Commands and Precepts hard to the Flesh.  ] They are hard indeed to the Flesh, yet to the Spirit very sweet and easie, and not grievous, as the Apostle testifies; nor to the Flesh so hard neither as was the service and work Jesus Christ performed for thy sake; besides, set the necessity of doing thy Duty against the difficulty that attends thee in it, for the Honour of God and the bearing up his Name in the World is concern'd in it, together with the increase and strengthning of thy Graces, with the blessed Peace and Comfort of thy precious Soul; for the Lord meeteth him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteousness ,  164 and that remembers him in his ways ; besides, consider the Recompence that attends this difficult Work;  165 Moreover, by them is thy Servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward . Ungodli. There is Salvation to be had Sir without the Walls of this City. Godly , There is no promise of Salvation made to those who sin against their Light, and willingly refuse to follow Christ: the Promise runs to the Obedient Soul, to them that obey him, to them that keep his Commandments; besides, without are Dogs, Sorcerers, Whoremongers, Murtherers ,  166 and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie . Ungodli. Come say what you will, they are poor, mean, and despiable people who are within the City; how many noble, wise. and mighty Men after the Flesh have their habitations there? Godli. Thus the Jews said of old, Have any of the Rulers ,  167 or the Pharisees believed on him? but this people who know not the Law are cursed . Though they are outwardly poor, many of them, yet they are inwardly rich, poor in Temporals but rich in Spirituals; but hark, God hath chosen the poor of this world rich in Faith, heirs of the Kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ;  168 besides, there are some Rich and Honourable, and have been in all Ages,  169 who dwell in this City; St Paul doth not say, Not any mighty or noble are called . Ungodli. The greatest part of the World value other Cities far above it. Godli. The whole World is said to lie in Wickedness, and the greatest part of it. Souls are deceived by this cunning Impostor, and hence it is they love Darkness rather than Light; the Way is narrow, and the Gate strait that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it .  170 Ungodli. Alas, the Inhabitants are at variance, the City is divided, and they love not one another. Godli. I must confess, now thou hast hit it; this is too true, but what tho! when was the true Church without Divisions? was it not so with the Corinthians . Ungodli. Say what you please, they are all but a company of Schismaticks and Vile Hereticks . Godli.   [   Gods People always accused for Hereticks, &c. ] Soul regard him not; the Papists always after this manner charged the Saints and Servants of God, because they left their polluted Synagogue: 'tis one thing to be accused thus, for leaving the True Religion, and Church of God; and another thing, to bear this brand, for forsaking and separating from a false Faith and Church; for so all true Protestants ever affirm'd and maintain'd the Church of Rome be, after that way you call Heresie. So I teach Men to Worship the God of their Fathers ,  171 &c. Ungodli. Come, come, Friend, if you will be so venturous to go unto this City, you will not be able to abide there long; and if you subject to Gospel Ordinances, and become a Citizen of Sion , and afterwards fall away and dissert the place, your state will be sad, for then you will not only bring up an evil report upon the City, but also must perish for ever; for there will remain for you no more Sacrifices for Sin. Godli.   [   No falling finally from a state of true Grace.  ] Let not this frighten thee, poor Soul; for God hath promised to put his Fear so into thy heart, that thou shalt not depart from him; his Covenant is an everlasting one, ordered in all things, and sure, and whom he loves he loves to the end, & c. The very same whom he calls he also justifies, and them whom he justifies, 172 them he also glorifies  . Christ gives to all his Sheep eternal Life,  173 and none of them shall perish, nor can any pluck them out of his hand. Ungodli. Friend, you are a vile Sinner, and not worthy to have a dwelling in the City of God; for the Truth is, 'tis a lovely place, and too good and honourable for such as you are. Godli. Thou shewest thy subtilty, poor Soul, 'tis his Master Apollyon that instructs and teaches him his Lesson; What a Serpent is here? One while 'tis a bad City, and not worth regard, and what not; and now 'tis so good, he would perswade thee thou art not worthy to have a dwelling in it;    [   Our unworthiness no ground of neglect of our Obedience to Christ.  ] suppose it should be so, wilt thou therefore refnse to go thither? Art thou worthy of the Bread thou eatest, or of the Drink thou drinkest, or of the Cloaths thou wearest? Why yet thou dost not refuse those things because of thy own unworthiness; even so do not harken to this cursed Impostor, and refuse Christ his Merits and his Ordinances, and a place in this blessed City, because not worthy of any of them, the more unworthy thou seest thy self to be, the more welcome thou art there; come along with us. Ungodl. If thou steps one step further, I'll raise all the Forces of Hell upon thee, my Armies are approaching to my Assistances; therefore I conjure you in the name of Apollyon , and Belzebub , and all the Powers of the Infernal Lake , to desist your purpose; What say'st thou, wilt submit thyself to my Mercy, and subject to my Authority. Neop. Blessed be God, I fear thee not, I have found out this day mine Enemy, thou Child of the Devil, dost begin to threaten me? I yield my self conquered, but not by the force of thy Arms; come holy Prince and Brethren, let us go to Mount Zion , 'tis the City of my Father, of whom glorious things are spoken. O how I long to be there! pray let us be gone: Then they all Four fell a singing of Psalms of Praise and Thanksgiving to God; which the grim Monster perceiving, began to foam and rage fearfully, and Apollyon who look'd on all the while, grinn'd his Teeth to see the Combate end thus to his loss, and also cast a most terrible look upon poor Thoughtful , and could hardly forbear (to revenge himself) by falling upon him, but that he saw he was compleatly Arm'd from Head to Foot,    [   Christian well Armed is in vain Assaulted Sin and Satan vanquished.  ] with his Sword drawn in one hand, and his Shield in the other, having all his Glorious Retinue with him; the Tyrant hereupon began to slink away, but before he went, swore he would e're long blow up the whole City at once with Gun-powder; but True Godliness seeing what a rage he was in, called to him, and told him he had sad News to Acquaint him with. Ungodli. What is that? Godli. What; for certain there is a Warrant sign'd and seal'd, and already gone out against you to Apprehend you, and bring you to the Judgment Seat. Ungodli. Who shall try me? Godli. You will hear that e're long. Ungodli. A pretty Story! Immediately all the Powers of Hell vanished in great disorder, the Tyrant being somewhat startled at the News he heard; and the Three Noble Worthies with the Heavenly High-born Prince True Godliness with much joy, and got all safe into the holy and beloved City; of which in the next place, I shall give you a brief Description.  A Compendious Description of Mount Zion the City of God, that is now, and always hath been Besieged by the Powers of Darkness, together with the Reasons why it holds out still.  the City of God opened.  ] being built upon a firm and everlasting Rock, Jesus Christ; Upon this Rock will I build my Church .  174 As touching its Foundation, mark what the Holy Scripture saith,    [   The Foundation of it.  ] Behold I lay in Zion for a Foundation, a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious corner Stone, a sure Foundation ,  175 &c. Also the Foundation of the Walls more especially are Garnished with all manner of precious Stones, as Jasper, Saphire, Chalcedon ,  176 Emerauld, Sardonyx, Sardius , Chrysolite, Berryl; Topaz, Chrysoprasus, Jacinth and Amethyst . Thirdly ,    [   The Walls of it are four.  ] The Walls that compass the City about are impregnable; they are four in number: We have a strong City; Salvation will God appoint for Walls and Bulwarks .  177 The first Wall is the special Providence of God; Hast not thou made a Wall about him ?  &c. The Second Wall is, the glorious Protection of the Holy Angels ,  178 the Angels of the Lord incamp round about them that fear him . The Third Wall is, All the Attributes of God gloriously exerted, or put forth to defend and secure it : and thus he is said to be a Wall of Fire round about her .  179 The Fourth is,   [   What built with.  ] its Holy Disciple, by which it becomes distinct and separated from all Cities on Earth .  180 This City also, is built up with precious living Stones,  181 being most rarely and curiously compact, or fitly framed together ,    [ The Laws of it.  ] for an Habitation of God through the Spirit . Fiftly , As to the Laws and Statutes of it, they are all contained in Christs New Testament ; the Holy Scripture being the great Magna Charta of the Church. Sixthly , As touching the Government of it, the Lord Jesus is the Chief or Supream Ruler, Judge, and Law-giver, of this Spiritual Corporation ; and under him are Bishops and Deacons, & c. who are appointed by him to administer Justice and Righteousness to all its Inhabitants. Seventhly ,    [   The Trade and Merchandize of it.  ] The Trade or Merchandize of it, is better than the Merchandise of Gold ,  &c. They all deal in one and the same Commodities, fetching their riches from afar , where their blessed Correspondent, Jesus Christ is, and makes them glorious and quick Returns. They deal not in any prohibited, counterfeit, nor corruptible Goods, As to the Nature of this Cities Commodities . 1\. They are of a Soul-enriching Nature ; their Worth not to be valued. 2\. they are Needful Things , being all of absolute necessity . 3\. They are such Commodities that will make the Nation, People or Person that buyes them, happy for ever ; and they cannot be happy indeed without them. 1\. They deal in and for the Truth , which is offered to sale on easie terms every day whilst the Market lasteth; which there is fear will end ere long. This City is the Pillar and Ground of Truth :  182 O buy it therefore, and sell it not. 2\. The second thing is a Soul-converting, and Soul-enriching Gospel ;  183 The Law shall go forth of Sion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 3\. The third Commodity is, The Gifts and Graces of the Spirit . 4\. Another is, The Pearl of great Price , worth ten thousand Worlds.    [ A Glorious River in the City Sion .  ] Eighthly , Now as the Trade and Commerce of this City lies principally in Merchandize fetcht from afar , so there is also a glorious River which runs through every Street , which is Navigable , by means of which all those glorious Commodities are convey'd to it; whereby the City is wonderfully Enriched:  184 Now this River proceeds from the Throne of God and the Lamb, and is as clear as Cristal ; the Nature also of the water of this River is admirable. For, First , it will heal all Diseases of the Inward Man, as Spiritual Blindness ,  &c. Secondly ,    [   The Nature of the Water of this River opened,  ] It Infallibly Cures, the Consumption , or decay of Faith, Love, Zeal ,  &c. Thirdly , It brings down the Tympany of Pride , and makes a man very Humble and little, in his own Eyes. Fourthly , It is good against the Tremblings of the Heart , and makes a Man Courageous in Christ's Cause, in an Evil Day. Fifthly , It Cures Spiritual Deafness , making a Person very quick and ready to hear what his Duty is. Sixthly , It is an excellent Remedy, to purge out all Noxious Humors of the Soul , from whence most Distempers flow; making a man sound at Heart, and Holy in Life. Seventhly , It will restore a lost Appetite , and make a Person relish well, the Food of God's Word. Eighthly , It is a most soveraign Antidote against the Plague of Sin ; insomuch, that a man, if he chance to fall amongst Infected People every day, it will preserve him from danger. Ninthly , It will revive a Fainting Spirit , and set broken Bones ; as David found by Experience. Tenthly , 'Tis excellent good against Spiritual Barrenness ; also, it Cures all Diseases of the Tongue; a Distemper that most Professors are addicted to. Eleventhly , 'Tis good against Weakness of the Hands , and Feebleness of the Knees ;  185 so that 'twill cause a lame man to leap as a Hart . Twelfthly , It Cures all Distempers of the Head ; occasioned by Heresies and Erroneous Principles , that corrupt the Understanding. Thirteenthly , It is Water of Life ; he that drinks of it, shall never die. Lastly , This River hath Three special Streams:    [   This River hath three streams.  ] 1\. The stream of Ordinances . 2. a stream of Heavenly Graces . And the Third is, a stream of Precious Promises . 'Tis no marvel, these things considered, that this City is Besieged by the Powers of Darkness. Ninthly , As touching the Priviledges ,    [   Shewing what the Priviledges of the City Sion are.  ] Franchises , and Immunities of this Spiritual City , as they are great, so they are many. 1\. Freedom from Sin, i. e. from the Guilt, Filth, Power , and Punishment thereof, which comprehends Pardon of all Iniquity . This Freedom cost dear; no less then the Price of Christ's most Precious Blood . Also 'tis a Sealed Freedom, Sealed by the Holy Spirit. Thirdly , 'Tis a lasting Freedom, never to be revoked, by the Giver, forfeited by the Receiver; I will remember their Sins no more. 2. Priviledge , is Union with God. 3. Justification. 4. Sanctification. 5. Adoption. 6. Acceptation. 7. Free access to the Throne of Grace. 8. Communion with the Father and the Son. 9. Fellowship with Saints 10. Peace of Conscience. 11. Joy in the Holy Ghost. 12. A glorious Habitation in this City. 13. Divine Protection, or sure refuge in God. 14. A Right to the City Stock ,    [ The Stock of the Holy City.  ] which is the unsearchable riches of Christ . Amongst many other things respecting the City Stock, these three are comprehended. 1. A Right to all the Prayers made three. 2. To the Promises that belong to it. 3. The Stock or store of Food or Spiritual Provision laid up in it; God having said her will satisfie his Poor with Bread .  186 16\. Liberty , or a proper Right to come and drink of, and wash in, and have all other Blessings of the River mentioned before. 17. A Right of Voyce in chusing all sorts of Officers. 18. The Benefit of the City-Guard , which are an innumerable Host of Angels . 19. An Assurance of Eternal Life . 20. Lastly, When they die, to go to Christ, or to have a dwelling Place with the glorified Saints above. But let this be premised, That none but True Citizens are to have these Privileges. If any get in by Policy, whose Hearts are not right with God, let such know they have no Right nor Lot in these Matters. Now the Reason why this City holds out, notwithstanding 'tis and has been long besieged by these mighty Armies, who seem to come up on the breadth of the Earth, against it is, 1\. Because, tho' it be but a little City,   [   The reason why this City , tho' besieged, yet still holds out. A strong Tower in the City of God.  ] (comparatively to the City Sensuality and Great Babylon ) yet 'tis a strong City, being (as you have heard) built upon a Rock , and the Throne of God and the Lamb is in it, God dwelleth in Zion, sing Praises; 'tis the habitation of his Holiness, and the place where his Honour dwells . Also in it is a strong Tower , which is the Name of the Lord ; and this Tower is furnished with glorious Artillery , and other Military Engines of War to keep off, and destroy the Assailants ; for from hence the Almighty distributes Death, Pestilence and Famine , by which he makes dreadful Desolation and Havock amongst the proud Enemies and graceless Rebels that come against it; the murthering Cannon never roar'd out more horror and amazement to Mortals, than doth the wrath and vengeance of an incensed God from hence, upon all the Powers of Darkness ; he has his Hailstones and amazing Thunder with Coals of Fire , and dreadful Arrows , which he now and then lets fly like Lightning , to make the Inhabitants of the Earth to tremble. O, this is the place of Security in the day of Trouble; and wo be to all them that fight against Mount Zion . Doth Apollyon and the Tyrant think to prevail against this place? they may indeed tread down the outward Courts ; 187 but the Promise is,  188 The Gates of Hell shall never pre-against the Church . Yet nevertheless Sin , that bloody Traveller (tho' he lately received a great Blow by True Godliness , and lost his Prey, being forc'd to retreat in much disorder, did not desist his Hellish Enterprize against this Town Religion , or the City of God ; but was resolved to try what he could do in a clandestine way, in order to the spoiling and ruining of the Inhabitants thereof; which to effect, he forthwith makes up to the Walls, and having Information from his Master Apollyon , that the Porter , who had the Charge of one of the Gates, was off his Watch, he hasted up to see if he could not get in thereat. The Name of the Porter is The Fear of God ; and by this means he got in part of those Armies that were headed by Lucifer , [   The way that Satan prevails to the hurt and detriment of Sion .  ] Beelzebub and Apollyon , which were made up (as you heard) of the Lust of the Flesh , the Lusts of the Eyes , and Pride of Life ; by which means many within the Town were overcome by Covetousness, Pride, Vain Glory and Sensual Pleasures ; and these being overcome by Surfetting and Drunkenness , greatly weakned the place, and brought it into contempt abroad, opening the mouths of the Ungodly wide against it; who positively asserted the Inhabitants were as worldly, proud and carnal as those of other Cities. Secondly , He also prevailed another way, through the Treachery of one Mrs. Heart , who, like a cursed Incendiary , wrought much Mischief amongst them, and basely corrupted multitudes of them, by lodging one Hypocrisie in their Houses, a notorious Villain as most in the world. Thirdly , He got also in amongst them by the means of a Beggarly Rascal, called Sloth , alias Security , alias Idleness , who took many of them off from their Duty, these much pleased themselves with the bare Name of Religion and Christianity , crying out, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord ,  &c. and yet were great strangers to the Life and Power of Godliness , having Lamps, and but little Oyl. Alas! how should it be otherwise? For they were so basely drawn aside, and deceived by Sin , that they neglected their business, and not with that care and diligence (as became them) followed their Trade; and hereby they grew very poor and low in Grace and spiritual Experiences. And I think it may not be amiss to shew you here, how Sloth, Security and Idleness ,  &c. brought this Poverty upon them. 1\. It was by causing them to be much abroad, finding faults in others,   [ The cause why some grow poor in the Holy City .  ] when they should have been at home. 2\. By causing them to neglect attending the Exchange-time; I mean, the solemn Meetings of the Citizens in the Temple where God is worshipped, and Knowledge may be had how their Affairs go in Heaven, and also how by putting off (in a lively and chearful manner) their Duties, they might have glorious Returns of God's Mercies. 3\. By not keeping their Books or Accompts carefully, that so they might know whether they got or lost; and hence many of them were ignorant how things stood between God and their poor Souls. Nay, and Peccatum found out other ways to plague and spoil the City, by enticing Mrs. Heart to let in amongst them one Unbelief , alias, Distrust ; who perswaded many not to venture much Goods on Shipboard Sayling being now grown so dangerous; but to drive a poor, petty, private Trade. Moreover, This homebred Enemy Unbelief , caused some of them to depart from God, and to doubt of his Faithfulness; by which means, their Hands were greatly weakned, and the cursed Monster prevailed exceedingly. 5\. He surprized some of the Watchmen , filling their hearts with many sad thoughts, by bringing one upon them, called Slavish Fear ; who made them too much neglect their Duties , and not maintain their ground, nor give warning of the approaching danger the City was in. He did much mischief to the City, by dividing the Inhabitants, or causing of sad Animosities and Divisions amongst them, and thereby alienated their Affections one from another; nay, and some of them were almost prevailed with to Trade with the City Babylon for a parcel of Detestable Traditions ; and some others were enticed by the Lusts of the Eyes , to deal with the City Sensuality for some of her abominable Fashions . 7\. Also, Divers, who were lookt upon as Brave Champions , were secretly and cowardly slain by him; and others were seiz'd and carried away captive, who sallied out upon the Enemy. So that (in a word) by one means or an other (by the help of Apollyon ) he greatly succeeded in his Design upon the Holy City , which so heightned or raised his Spirit, that at last he broke forth into an (amazing, haughty and Soul-frighting Triumph ; to the effect following;  Sin or Ungodliness's haughty Triumph.  he had prevailed, and that there was no place wherever he came, but by one means or another he got Entertainment; being made the only Joy and Darling, of the greatest part of the whole World, all bowing and bending to him, and willingly becoming his Slaves and Vassals, brake forth into a Vain-glorious Triumph, after this manner. O how I am Exalted, who is like unto me, or may be compared with me in the whole Universe! how like a low shrub, and contemptible Fellow, doth True Godliness look, he is glad to trudg on Foot, when I am mounted on Horse-back, whilst Thousands sound their Trumpets before me, and behold what Renowned Emperors, and Mighty Potentates do follow me in Chains and Fetters, as amazing Trophies of my All-conquering Arm. Godliness rejoyces, when he can subdue here and there two or three Souls, and they too, are but part of the refuse of the Earth; but I Mighty, I overcome Millions, nay, subdue Thousands in an hour, and those of all sorts: And though I use them at my Pleasure, put out their Eyes, and make them grind at my Mill, and do the Devils drudgery, yet behold, how contented and well pleased the Fools are, they hang upon me, hugg me, cleave to me, and by no means can the Powers above allure them to leave me; the thoughts of forsaking me, and losing my sweet Company, is as bad, nay, worse than Death to them; do you think they have no more Wit, than for the Vanity of a Parnon, or trifle of inward Peace, or Joyes of Heaven, to forgo the wonderful Glories, Riches, and Pleasures, I offer them on Earth. But alas, why talk I thus? I do not only make them happy here,    [   The deceitfulness of Sin .  ] as far as the Flesh, World and Devil can do it; but promise them Bliss also to Eternity , when ever they die: on easier terms too, than any Body else will, I am sure. If they will beleive me, let them be as wicked as I or Hell can make them, and continue so too until Death seize them; yet with a Lord have Mercy upon us , they all go to Heaven : And what would they have trow? I teach them to live viciously ; and yet die happily: And that's the thing, I find, they so greatly desire. Is there any like me, Sirs? Look, and you'l love me. Did Godliness ever raise any of his Followers to so high Grandeur, as I have mighty Mahomet? Ah! what a pritty Knack did I infuse into his Noddle, whereby I, in a moment, subdued many Millions; and have them still as fast in my Chains, as ever? And, brought into his Holinesses Coffer , by that fable Christ? (to use one of the Pope's own Phrases.) If I should rehearse the Wonders I have done, I should doubtless be strangely admired. And upon this, there was a dreadful Noise heard, and terrible Lightning flasht forth in his very Face: Also, the Rocks and Mountains seemed to shake and cleave asunder; so that the Monster began to tremble, and cry'd out; Lord Beelzebub, what's the matter? Belze. I can't tell; something more then usual. With that, he suddenly heard one cry like God's Vengeance; Seize him! seize him! Lay hold on the Monster of Pollution, cursed Sin, and bring him to the Judgment Seat! Upon this, all were silent, and the Devils who look'd as pale as Ashes, whisper'd Peccatum in the Ear, to be gone with all speed; and on a sudden, he fled away so swiftly, that before the Officers came to apprehend him, he hid himself.  Wherein you have a Hue and Cry after Tyrant Sin: Also, who they are, that pursue him: Together, with the manner of his Apprehension, Arraignment, Tryal, Sentence, and Condemnation.  the Bloody, Rebellious, and Trayterous Monster Sin ; we shall proceed, with what speed we can, towards his Tryal : But he, being already Alarm'd with the News of the pursuit that was like to be made after him, got away, and hid himself, in some or all those Houses where he had been entertained. Therefore, the Great and Mighty Jehovah (if I may with Reverence Speak it) orders a Hue and Cry , or rather a Proclamation to be issued out, to Apprehend him; to the end he may be brought to a Legal Tryal . Now the High Constable ,    [   Who they are that pursue the Tyrant . ] that hath received the Hue and Cry , is Divine Providence ; who, by the High Sheriff , ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   Divine Wisdom.  ] was ordered (that he might the better seize him) to appear sometimes on a White-Horse, attended with Mr. Gospel, Soul-Pity ; at another time, on a Black Horse, attended with Mr. Sadness, Mourning , and Terror . 3\. Sometimes on a Pale-colour'd Horse, attended with Mr. Pining, Famine , and Pestilence . 4\. Sometimes on a Red Horse, attended with Mr. Cruel, War, Fire , and Sword . 5\. And then, as there was occasion, he rides on a Speckled Horse, attended with Mr. Mercy , mixt with Judgment . And for the more easy finding him out, there were Three other worthy Gentlemen, in the King's Name, warn'd to assist him, viz. Mr. Theologue , with his Sword drawn in his hand. --- Mr. Opperation of the Spirit . Mr. Enlightned Conscience . The Proclamation , or Hue and Cry , was to this effect: These are to will and require, and strictly to command you, in the great and dreadful Name of the incensed Majesty of Heaven and Earth, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, to search diligently for find out, and forthwith seize and apprehend that Notorious, Trayterous, and Blasphemous Monster, called Peccatum, alias, Sin, alias, Ungodliness, alias, Iniquity, alias, Transgression,  &c. Who hath been travelling up and down, from Place to Place, from Country to Country, from Town to Town, from Family to Family, and from one Person to another; breaking all the good Laws of God, Nature, and Nations, and by secret Wiles and Diabolical Devices, and subtil Insinuations, hath deceived, undone, and eternally destroyed many Millions of Souls. As touching his Person, his Name sufficiently describes him; He is a strange Monster, transforming himself into almost what Shapes he pleases: Sometimes appearing like a Lyon, sometimes like a Dove, &c; but most commonly like a Serpent, with a Sting at his Tayl, and the Terrestial Globe in his Hand; which signifies the Pleasures, Honours and Riches of the World, which he offers as a Bait, to catch or beguile his Prey. Now, upon the Hue and Cry there are large and wonderful Promises made to all such that should fully, readily, and heartily discover him; and, to the uttermost of their power, endeavour to seize and aprehend him: so that he might be put to Death. And, on the other hand, there are most dreadful Threats of Wrath , and Eternal Punishment , denounced to all such who shall willingly or wittingly hide, cover, or conceal him, or not ingenuously confess him, and yield him up into the Hands of Justice . The Nature of which Promises , and Threats , are as follows. Jesus Christ ,   [   Jesus Christ his gracious Salutations to all the Children of Men.  ] by the Infinite Wisdom and Grace of God , King of Saints, and King of Nations, Mediator of the New-Covenant; and, by the Eternal Decree and Appointment of God the Father, Judge of the Quick and Dead: To all the Children of Men scattered upon the Face of the whole Earth; the Delight of my Heart; whom I loved, and laid down my Life for: Sendeth Greeting . Know ye and understand, That , There is a notorious Traytor, Rebel, and bloody Tyrant, called Sin, alias, Ungodliness,  &c. who hath, for near these Six Thousand Years, gone up and down in the Earth, with Apollyon, Prince of Darkness; like a bloody and an unsatisfy'd Monster, deceiving, tearing in pieces, and utterly destroying Millions of poor Souls: And that which wounds and grieves my tender Heart, is to see so many of you (whose eternal Good I earnestly seek) and have sought (as witness the shedding of my most precious Blood) to love, approve of, hide, conceal, and connive at this cursed Enemy of mine, and of their own Souls: Therefore whosoever he be that shall hear the joyful Tidings of my Gospel, and have the knowledge of my absolute Will and Pleasure contained therein, or otherwise have sufficient Means to discover the Evil of Sin,   [   Many great and preci- Promises made to all that seize, confess and crucifie Sin .  ] to him who shall readily, willingly and sincerely discover, confess, and endeavour to take or apprehend this mine Enemy, so that he may be crucified, he shall have a full and everlasting Pardon for all and every of his former Evils, Treasons, Rebellions, Blasphemies, with all manner of Omissions, Commissions, Faults, Frailties, Deviations, Iniquities and Transgressions whatsoever in his loving, liking, countenancing or cherishing of this dangerous and cruel Adversary of his Soul; and not only so, but shall also be received into my Favour, and become a Son or Daughter of God, and have my precious Grace infused into his Heart, with liberty of free Access to the Father, in my Name, for all good things he stands or shall stand (at any time) in need of: Besides, he shall have a place in my House,  189 and I will come unto him, and sup with him, and he with me ; and not only so, but shall be made an Heir and Joynt-heir with me in all that Glory and Felicity which God the Father hath raised me to, or promised to grant me (as I am Mediator) in his Blessed Word,  190 so that he shall sit down with me on a Throne , and have a Crown of Glory , and reign with me for ever and ever . And the end these Promises may be sure, firm and unalterable, I give you my Word, my Covenant established upon the immutability and Oath of God;  191 also ratified and confirmed by my Blood ,  192 and shall be sealed to you by the Holy Ghost . But on the contrary, Whosoever he be that shall refuse to come in,   [ Dreadful Threats denounced against all that hide or conceal Sin .  ] or not accept of this my infinite Grace and Clemency, but shall dare to harbour, hide, love, or conceal, or not sincerely confess this mine Enemy, and to crucifie him, I do protest and declare by him that liveth for ever, that all their horrid Treasons, Rebellions, Blasphemies, Debaucheries, Murthers, Omissions, Commissions, Faults, Frailties, Deviations, Iniquities and Transgressions, shall be charged upon his own Head; and all my Lamb-like Meekness, Sweetness and Mercy, shall be turned into incensed Wrath and Fury; so that he shall find me like a Lion, to tear and rend him in pieces, and none shall be able to save or deliver him out of my hands, but I will blot his Name out of my Book , and suffer him to fall under the fearful Accusations and amazing Horror of a tormenting Conscience, and at last will cast him (with this cruel Enemy) into a Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone, in the presence of the Holy Angels,  193 and in my presence,   [   Divine Providence sent out to search for Sin . ] and the Smoke of his Torment shall ascend up for ever and ever . Immediately upon this, the High Constable, (Divine Providence) with his Attendants, went forth to search, find out, and apprehend the Cursed Traveller , and Implacable Enemy of God. But O the Subtilty he used to blind the Eyes of poor Mortals, so that he might not be discovered! For Lo, every suspicious House is now searched, where he had been entertained; some of which I shall here mention, with the strange Devices they used to conceal him; every one almost having got a Cloak ready to cover him. The first Place they searched,    [   Youth-shire searched .   ] was Youth-shire ; and the Cry was, Is not Sin here? Is there none have entertained that horrid Enemy of God. Immediately Theologue knockt at one Door, and at another Door, where brave young Hectoring Gallants lived; and demanded, if they had not let him into their Houses ( viz. their Hearts) and made him their Companion, hugging him in their Bosoms, and letting him rule, and sway the Scepter over them? No, God forbid, said one; Far be it from me, saith another: What, I harbour God's Enemy! Do you think I am such a Villain? What means then (saith Theologue) the Bleating of the Sheep in my Ears? Are you not Swearers, unclean Persons, Gamesters, Drunkards,    [   Most young men hide and conceal Sin .  ] & c? They all replied, to excuse and hide him; Who, Sir, is without Sin? And tho you will Swear, yet, may be, you'l Lie; and as touching those things of which you speak, they are but Tricks of Youth. Alas, That which you call our Luxury and Lasciviousness, is but our Gayeties and pleasant Pastimes; and that which you call Prodigality, is but a true Noble and Generous Spirit: We would have you know, Sir, we are no niggardly Curs. Now Conscience being asleep in these vain and ungodly Youngsters Houses, or otherwise stifled, none of them would confess he was lodged in their Affections; nor will they ('tis to be feared) till the High Constable, Divine Providence , comes to search for him on his Black, Pale or Red Horse of Flood, Famine, Pestilence and Death , and then they must expect no Mercy. Then the Search came into the Country of Nobility and Yeomanry (where dwell many poor Tenants ) to enquire after this Enemy , under the Name of Voluptuousness Iniustice ,  &c. But presently he was denied, and covered under the Cloak of good Humour, lawful Recreations , and Humane Policy , &c. After this,   [   The House of Riches searched.  ] the Hue and Cry came into the Town of Riches , and the Traveller was searched for under the Name of Covetousness ; but here was not one that knew him: Nay, so far (I will assure you) they were from giving him quiet and loving Entertainment, that they cry'd out against him with open Mouth, calling him a vile and cursed Traytor ; but in the mean time, they hid him under the Cloak of Thriftiness and Good Husbandry .    [   The covetous rich mans Excuses for Sin .  ] You suspect me, saith one, because I hate Prodigality, Waste, Riot, Gluttony , and Idleness ,  &c. Ought not every man to lay up for a Rainy day? I have Children to provide for? And doth not the Apostle intimate, 'tis the Father's Duty to lay up for them? Would you have me turn Bankrupt, and play the Fool (and Knave) as many have done of late? Do I covet any Body's Goods but mine own? or to add to my store, cheat others, or rob the Widow and Fatherless? Come, Sir, you are mistaken; the Villain you seek for, is not here: I love him no better than you do: Alas, I have taught many how to live in these hard times, and to be provident, & c. Besides, I could tell you how liberal I have been too: 'Tis not a little that I have given to the Poor, and to the Church and State. Theologue perceiving this man, after such a confident manner justifying himself, and utterly denying the Traytor , was resolved, by the help of Mr. Conscience , to search and sift him warily. Theol. Come Friend, I am not satisfied with you, notwithstanding all your great Flourishes: I am perswaded I shall find God's Enemy , I mean Sin , the Bloody Traveller , in your House; (tho it be not so easie a thing to discover him as in other places where I have already searched;) and by the Name of Covetousness too, for all this. Riches . Ay Sir? Theol. Sir, I doubt not but by the help of Conscience , I shall do it, if he be not utterly stifled or asleep; but if he be, Ile do what I can to awake and rowze him up. 1\. Are not your Affections set upon Earthly things,   [   Sin discovered under the Name of Covetousness .  ] more than upon Heavenly? or do not you mind things below, more than things above? Doth not the World run more in your mind than God, Christ or Religion? 2\. Do not you prefer the gain of earthly things more than the profit of your own Soul, and so exalt the World above the Word? 3\. Doth not your Heart, when you approach near to God in his Worship, run after your Riches , contriving then how to encrease your Store? 4\. Doth not outward Losses in your Estate, trouble you more than the Spiritual loss of your inward man? Which may be known by the great Complaints you have in your mouth upon the one account, and the little upon the other. 5\. Do you not love Son or Daughter more than Jesus Christ? Pray consider this well; for if this should be so, are you not a worldly and covetous Wretch? and can you clear your self herein, when you have so many Hundreds, if not Thousands, for such a Son, and for such a Daughter, and forget Christ, his Church, Ministers, and poor Members, or put them off with less than the fiftieth, if not the hundredth part, or with a Trifle, or nothing at all. Christ his Saints and Ministers, shall hardly have Bread to eat, or Cloaths to wear, whilst your Sons and Daughters are richly clad, and fed sumptuously every day? Nay, do you not lay out needlesly in Toys and Trifles, much more than you can freely part with for Christ's sake? And yet is not Covetousness and Self- Love lodged in your Heart? 6\. Have not the Papists and other Idolaters done more for the upholding their Superstition and Idol-Worship than ever you did for the true Worship of God? Have not many of them been more thoughtful for the Good of Holy Church , (as they call it) than ever you were for the True Church of Christ? Doth not the Prophet say,  194 That the Idolatrous Heathen lavish Gold out of the Bag, and weigh Silver in the Ballance, and hire a Goldsmith ,  &c. and all to adorn an Idol? And do you not give grutchingly to the True God? and rather tie up your Bags, and keep your Coffers lock'd, rather than lavish out for the adorning your Profession, and holy Gospel? and yet is not Covetousness hid in your House? Are you not unsatisfied, and still lusting after more Gold and Silver , though you have got several Hundreds, if not Thousands by you? And tho you are not guilty of downright Theft (for that is another Sin) yet have you not got part of your Estate by pinching and griping the Poor, or taking unlawful profit in selling your Goods, or unlawful Interest for your Money? Nay, have you not denied to lend a little Money to a poor Brother, without a Pledge, and taken Usury of him too, contrary to God's Word? And when you give, & c . do you not give sparingly, and not out of a bountiful, chearful and willing mind; nor so much to please God, as fear to displease Man, or Shame, lest you should be judged guilty of Covetousness? Have you not suffered the Cares of this World , and the Deceitfulness of Riches to choak the Seed of the Word , which was once sowed in your heart, or made it become unfruitful? Have you, as your Riches encreased, or have gathered in, scattered abroad? Have you given to Christ and his People according to your Abilities, and their Necessities. Come Conscience , do thy Office; Hast thou not found the Cursed Enemy of God in this mans House? Conscience . Sir, I have; here he is: his Cloak is too thin and thredbare to hide or cover him from me any longer. Theolog. Hold them both fast; the Day of Tryal is near; for as the Sin , so the Sinner must both come to the Bar. The next Place they searched,    [   The House of Mrs. Gay Cloaths searched.  ] was the House of Mrs. Gay Cloaths , alias, Haughty Heart , for the Cursed Traveller , under the Name of Pride: But she presently denyed him, or that she had any Love for him; though (saith she) may be sometimes,    [   Her Plea for Pride .  ] he may, like a cunning bold Villain, rush into my Company. And further, to hide and conceal him, and make Excuses for him, she said, that her new Fashions were very comly; and God having given her a fair and beautiful Skin, why might she not shew it by her naked Breasts and Shoulders? Is it any where forbidden? Besides, saith she, There are some good Women and Virgins, of the Daughters of Sion , which follow the Fashions, and go in the same manner; and if they thought it was unlawful, they sure would not do it: And truly, Sir, for these Bulls, Towers, Shades, Curlings and Crispings , with rich Rings and Jewels , and other fine Ornaments , both for Body, House and Bed , we think they are very neat, handsome, and pretty things, and harmless no doubt; for the Pride you speak of, lies not in the Mode nor Fashion, but in the Heart: Besides, God (saith she) you cannot deny, doth allow many things for Ornament. Theologue .    [   Pride detected.  ] Madam, I fear, notwithstanding all your plausible Stories, and neat Allegations, we shall find the Traveller hid in your House, not only under the Name of Pride , but by several Names besides. For if Pride, Impudence and Uncleanness too, are not lurking within, you do very foolishly to hang out the Signs of them. Tertullian (as I find him lately cited by a worthy Author) hath told you plainly,    [   Mr. Jay , Rector of Chinnet in Oxfordshire  ] That Nakedness of the Breast is Adultery; and though it is possible such as go so, may be honest, yet but few that see them, will believe it . And Father Jerome cries out against you upon the same account; as if by this unseemly Posture, you rather challenge Combatants into the Field of Venus , than make any shew of fighting under the Banner of a Crucified Saviour. Let that Passion cease now, Holy Father . (saith my Author.) But 'tis time truly for some body else to rise up in his room, when Sin has so far prevailed, as to make Persons think that Christianity it self can connive at these Libertines , and easily indulge them in such pretty Toys and Trifles , &c. Notwithstanding the good Father rail'd on their Bare Necks ,,  &c.   [ See a Book called Gods Voyce against Pride.  ] as the Flames that consumed Youth, the Incentives of Lust, and never-failing Ensigns of an impudent Mind . Ay, and St. Chrysostom storms against them upon this account, with as great Zeal and Fury. What (saith he) do ye come hither into the House of God as to a Play? Do you come into the Sanctuary of your Maker, to make your Conquests here? And here to satisfie your Sensuality? Do you approach hither to attaque even God too? What does all this People, this soft and wanton Delicacies, this affected Nakedness, become the state and condition of such who would have Mercy for their Sins? Nay, this Father was so uncourtly and downright (saith my Author) as to tell those Naked Dames, That the very Devil sate upon their very shoulders, and pearch'd himself upon the little Mounts of their exposed Breasts, hopping as a Bird from one to another, and greatly pleased with the Rails they had set out for him. What have you, Madam , to say for your self? Is this the modest Apparel the Apostle willeth Women that profess Godliness, to go in? Doth this Mode become Christians? Is it a Sign (speak) of Shamefastness, Modesty, and Sobriety, which your Garbs and Gestures always should signifie, or of the contrary? Conscience , I will appeal to thee, is not Pride lodged in this Gentlewomans House? Doth not her Garb and wanton Habit suit and accord with her vain and haughty heart? We judge this way, i.e. the Tree by the Fruit it bears, and the Fountain, by the Water that proceeds from it, whether sweet or bitter. If Pride and Folly be not here, she has confounded all the Rules by which infallible Conclusions use to be drawn from Premises. Doth she not pride it secretly in her heart, and hate, rather than love those who reprove her Fantastical Fashions? Is she not proud , when she seeks rather to adorn her self, than the Gospel; and beautifie her Carkass, though she thereby expose Zion , the Kings Daughter , to reproach and shame? Doth she not disdain to make the poor Saints in their patch'd Coats her Companions? Nay, is she not ready to deny she knows them? Doth she not take up more time to dress her self in her Glass, than at Prayer in her Closet? Moreover, Is she not ready to admire her own Beauty? being also puffed up to see what she hath or is, either in respect of Birth or Estate, having got much Gold in her Coffer, and every thing brave, rich and rare to please her? What do you say, Conscience? Conscience . Sir, Here I have found him also,    [   Mrs. Gay-Cloaths convicted.  ] and I have likewise often told her the same I now declare unto you; but she endeavoured to stop her Ear, or stifle my Motions. Theolog. Commit her, Conscience , and the Tyrant with her into the Constables hand, that they may both appear at the Day of Tryal. After this, they proceeded farther, and the House of Mr. Fair-Speech , alias, False Tongue , was searched for him, by the Name of Lying , and there he was found hid under the Cloak of Equivocation ; he not remembring that Word, Thou shalt speak the Truth unto thy Neighbour in thy Heart . The House of Toss-Pot they searched for Sin , by the Name of Drunkenness ; but there he was found hid under the Cloak of Good Fellowship . The House of Mrs. Superstitious , they searched for him; but there he was hid under the Cloak of Good Order and Decency . And the excuse they had for him was, 'Tis no where forbid, & c. Forgetting Nadab and Abihu . 195 The House of Mr. Idolater was searched, and there he was hid under abundance of Images ; the Cloak was, They helpt Devotion ; and 'twas not the Image they worshipp'd, but God and Christ , in and by the Image ; not remembring that the blind Heathens and Pagans always asserted the same things; not believing their Idols were the True and Living God; but because they knew him not, they made these as Images of him, and in and by them performed Divine Worship to him; which the Second Commandment utterly detects as abominable. Mount Sion was searched, and there he was found in the House of Formality , hid under the Cloak of Religion and seeming Godliness , by the Name of Hypocrisie ; and if you would know by what means hew as discovered, read, Travels of True Godliness , Chap. 9, pag. 121, 122, 123. The Back-sliders House they searched for him, and there he was found hid under the Cloak of Humane Prudence , by the Name of Apostacy , though the Cause was Slavish Fear, Self-Love , and Unbelief ,  &c. The Houses of Presumptuous Sinners were searched, and there Sin was found hid under the fair Mantle of Vain Hope in God's Mercy . The House of Goodman Countrey they searched for him,    [   Goodman Countrey's House searched. p. 64.  ] by the Names of Ignorance , alias, Unbelief , alias, Hardness of Heart , alias, Sloth , alias, Idleness , alias Worldly Cares ,  &c. But here he was found hid under the Cloak of Self-Conceit , with good Wishings and Wouldings, The Lord help us, I shall do better when God gives me his Grace; My Heart is good ; and 'tis well if you do no worse; Are you wiser than your Forefathers ?  &c. Legalist's House was searched, and there he was found hid under the Cloak of Self-Righteousness , or Refined Morality . But into the City Sensuality the Hue and Cry came not; first, Because they shew their Sins as Sodom, and hide them not . But another Reason was this, viz. When Theologue ,  &c. was hasting towards the City , they heard of his Business, and shut up their Gates and Doors, so that there was no entring in; but I hear the High Constable, Divine Providence , hath a Warrant to ride forth, attended with Divine Wrath , on his Black, pale or Red Horse , and then with Vengeance the Gates will be made to fly open: O, I tremble to think what is coming upon them! Mr. Erroneous's House of the Town of Heresie , was searched, and there Sin was found hid under the plain Cloak of Yea and Nay , with pretended Zeal and seeming Sanctity . Besides these, every Town, City, Village and House was searched, where-e'er he had been entertained (except the City Sensuality .) But because I shall not have Room, the Press calling upon me to abbreviate; I must say no more as to his Apprehension ; But he being in hold, in the Chief Constable's Hand, and other Officers , we shall haste to his Tryal: For, heark, the Trumpets sound already, and the Judge is Just gone to the Bench . Tyrant Sin . --- Sir Sacred Scripture . Sir Sublime Matter . Sir Antiquity . Sir Majestical Authoritativeness of the Spirit . Sir Infinite Holiness . Sir Sweet Harmony . Sir Sincerity , and Credit of the Penmen. Sir Ancient Prophesies fulfilled. Sir Strange Miracles . Sir Wonderful Preservation . Sir Powerful Influence , and Efficacy on mens Souls. Sir Universal Consent of the Church and Holy Martyrs . Sir Heathen Acknowledgment . Sir Internal Evidence of the Spirit , Sir Antichristian Opposition . These were all Ordered, as Justices , by the High Sheriff, Divine Wisdom , to attend his Honourable Person on the Bench. The King's Attorney Gen. Divine Justice . --- The King's Solicitor Gen. Divine Mercy . --- Mr. Christianity . Mr. Primitive Purity, Theol. &c. --- Mr. Sound Judgment . Mr. Divine Reason . Mr. Enlightned Understanding . Mr. Godly Fear . Mr. Holy Revenge . Mr. Spiritual Indignation . Mr. Vehement Desire . Mr. Fiery Zeal of the Town of Knowledge. Mr. Right Faith . Mr. True Love . Mr. Sincerity . Mr. Impartiality . Immediately after the Jury was impannell'd, and the Commission opened, the Charge given, & c. the Prisoner was called to the Bar, and his Indictment was read; which run to this Effect; Sin, thou Monster of Iniquity, hold up thy Hand; thou art here Indicted by the Name of Peccatum , alias, Sin , alias, Transgression , alias, Iniquity , alias, Heresie , alias, Idolatry , alias, Unbelief , alias, Adultery , (and by a multitude of Names besides) That thou being the Child of the Devil, and Enemy to all Righteousness, hast Trayterously conspired with Apollyon , against the God of Heaven, and mortally wounded the whole Lump of Mankind assoon as ever thou camest into the World; and since that time, like a most Barbarous and Bloody Tyrant , hast gone ranging and roaring up and down, committing all the horrid and fearful Crimes and Villanies that the heart of Man can imagine; so that, in a word, thou art here Indicted for, and charged with, all and all sorts of Treasons, Murthers, Massacres, Idolatries, Heresies, Incests, Sodomies, Adulteries, Perjuries, Blaspbemies, Wars, Desolations,  &c. to the utter destruction of the Bodies and Souls of Millions of Millions of Men, Women and Children, contrary to the Peace, and to the great Dishonour of the Sacred Majesty of the King of Heaven and Earth. What sayst thou, Guilty, or not Guilty ? Before he could speak, one stands up, with his Hat on his Head, and spoke to this effect; Friend , He shall not plead at this Bar: Peccatum , Speak not a Word. Upon this, there was great Confusion in the Court; one crying out, What is he? and another, Who is he that speaks ? Cryer , Silence that Noise. Then one of the King's Councel, whose Name was Mr. Christianity , spoke to this purpose. Mr. Christian . Sir, what's your Name. Quaker , My Name Friend , 'tis like thou canst not understand it if I should tell thee. Judge . Take off his Hat. Do you hear, Friend ; what's the reason that you go about to obstruct, or hinder the orderly Proceedings of this Court against this Notorious Criminal ? Quak. What art thou who art exalted so high? come down and be abased thou Lifeless Figure ; I owe thee no Reverence. Judge . Who brought this Fellow hither? what Business hath he here? High-Constable . My Lord, he is a Criminal , and his Name is Impostor , alias, Erroneous ; and we took the Prisoner in his House, in the Town of Heresie ; and he endeavoured to hide under the Cloak of Light, Life, Power ,  &c. Quak. I deny thy authority:    [   The Quakers deny the Sacred Scripture to be the Judge of Sin and Controversies about Religion and Worship .  ] art thou the Judge of Sin and Error ? away with thee; thou sayst, There is not a just Man on Earth, than doth good and sinneth not ; and that the Apostles themselves, In many things offended all; and if they said they had no Sin, they lied and the Truth was not in them : O thou Damn'd Idol; must Sin be try'd by thee who art a Pleader and Advocate for it. Judge . Dost thou then deny my Authority? Quak. Thou hast no Authority over me; nor art thou a fit Judge to Try Sin . Know thou High and Lofty One , that I have Tryed, Judged and Condemned him already. Theologue . Friend, who is the proper Judge (say you) of Sin and of all Controversies in Religion? Quak. The Light within all Men, or Divine Revelation , I care not which of them two; however, I disown, Sir, Sacred Scripture to be the Judge ; though People have in an Idolatrous manner so long adored him. Christianity .  196 Doth not Christ say, The Word that I speak unto you, shall judge you, & c. Theologue . My Lord , though it is such a thing as never was hardly heard of before; that one who is a Criminal , and guilty of part of the same high Misdemeanors as a Notorious Malefactor stands charged with, should deny the authority of the Judge ; yet with your Lordships leave, I will endeavour to convince him of his Folly and Impudence . High-Sheriff . Sir, you may save your labour; for I, and all the worshipful Justices on the Bench, do know, that Sir Sacred Scripture , the honourable Judge, hath his Authority and Commission from the King; upon which the Kings own Hand and Broad Seal for it, was produced. Quak. Friend, prethee go on, and do what thou promised; I do not believe what they testifie. What is Sir Sacred Scripture , but a lifeless Fellow, a pitiful Paper-Judge , a Dead Letter ? Jesuit ,    [   The Papists and Quakers in some things agree  ] Well said Brother; or a Nose of Wax ; the Scripture only depends upon the Authority of the Church ; for indeed there thee and I differ; for I declare Rome to be the chief and supream Judge of Sin and all Controversies in and about Religion . Theol. I will answer you both, since I perceive you are Brethren in Iniquity . But first , I shall direct my Speech to thee who asserts the Light within all Men, to be the only Judge and Rule, &c. pray how can that be; is that Light a fit or capable Judge to Try Sin ; whereas 'tis evident he is wholly ignorant or knows nothing of one great Statute-Book , wherein many positive good Laws are written, which the Prisoner at the Bar hath abominably violated. Quak. What Statute-Book is that you mean? Theol. The glorious Gospel, or New Testament of Jesus Christ .    [ The Insufficiency of the Light with in .  ] Pray doth the Light within all Men make known the Precepts and Ordinances of God contained therein? or can that Judge convict any Person, that 'tis a Sin not to believe on Jesus Christ? Friend, the Heathens, Pagans, &c. have this Light within, but they know nothing of those things of which I speak; for though the Light within all, doth convince of Sin , as it is against God the Creator , yet not of those Sins that are committed against Christ , considered as Mediator ; and therefore he cannot be a fit and competent Judge of all Sins and Controversies of Religion . This was no sooner spoke, but in comes an Outlandish Man, of a Tawny Complexion. Judge . Friend, what are you?    [   The Pagans contradict the Quakers about the sufficiency of the Light within all Men.  ] Stranger . My Lord , I am one whom they call a Pagan , being born an Indian , dwelling in the furthest part of America . Judge . Did you ever hear of one Christ , or of the Gospel? &c. Stranger . No, my Lord , I know not what you mean. Judge . Do you believe there is a God ? Stranger . Yea my Lord, the Heavens and Earth by the Light of mine own natural Conscience teach me that there is a God ; and many other good things; as not to lye, steal, swear, bear false Witness against my Neighbour ,  &c. because I would not have him to do so by me; but as for him you call Christ , none of us, who are called Pagans , ever heard of him, therefore we know not that it is a Sin not to believe in him. Theol. See now, saith Theologue , how true my Words were. Quak. I matter not what he says, but I am sure I should have known as much of Christ as now I do, if I had never heard of the Scripture . Theol. Ay Friend, say you so! pray then answer me one Question; prethee what other things were they,  197 which Jesus did, which the Apostle says were not written? Upon this the Quaker was quite silent; and many in the Court were ready to smile; and cry'd out, O how are these People deluded! Quak. Friend, why dost not proceed to make out the Authority of thy Judge . Theol.   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The Sacred Scripture, proved to be the Only Judge of Sin , and Rule of Faith and Practice .   ] Well, I will now do it; and confute thee and thy Brother Jesuit too: and prove, that Sir Sacred Scripture is the proper Judge of all Sin , and the only Rule of Faith and Practice , and not the Light within, Revelation, Pope nor Church ; this will I do, and the rather, for the sake of this poor Pagan : I argue thus; Either the Sacred Scripture is the Judge , or God hath left us no certain Judge at all; but none will say God hath left us no certain Judge at all. You say the Light within all Men, is the Judge, &c. your Brother, he says, the Pope , or Church of Rome , or Pope and Church, &c. Now you must make out what you affirm in this Matter, by such plain certain and undeniable means, that no Deceiver or Impostor can pretend unto, otherwise all you say is nothing worth; because, a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, and so ad Infinitum , may come and affirm, this and that, and what not, to be the Judge ; and what any of them say would be of as good authority as that which either of you assert; and so all Men would be left at an uncertainty. Quak. By what Mediums must me make out what we say and affirm? Theol. I tell you such that may convince this Pagan , that what you say is true; in short, you must confirm it by Miracles , viz. Raise the Dead, open the Eyes of the Blind ,  &c. Quak. Thou lookest after a Sign. Theol. No Friend , you are mistaken, I need none to establish me in my Religion , because the Holy Scripture I own to be my Judge and Rule of Faith and Practice ,    [   The Holy Scripture confirmed by Miracles. c[illeg.]  ] which hath been confirmed already with strange and wonderful Miracles, &c. for God Almighty himself, never imposed any Law upon his Creatures without this his gracious Condescention to them; for he never gave forth but two Laws, Ministrations , or Testaments ; and both these he ratified by such Miracles , that none could ever do the like. First, God gave the Law to Israel , by the Hand of Moses ; and what Wonders did he do before Pharaoh in the Wilderness, and at the Red Sea , which none of the Heathens could ever gainsay, but have been forc'd to acknowledge? Secondly , He gave forth the Gospel and precious Law thereof, by Jesus Christ , which he confirmed; likewise by strange and wonderful Miracles. Friend, when God puts forth his miraculous working Power in confirmation of any Word or Doctrine, he avows it to be of and from himself. Now those Miracles that Moses and Jesus did, were such that none could ever disprove; though the Adversaries have often try'd if they could discover any deceit in them. If , saith Christ, I do not the Works that none other could do, believe me not ; but both you teach Doctrine ; quite different from his, and yet can do nothing to confirm what you say to be true, which others cann't perform. If the Worshipful Justices of Peace upon the Bench might be heard, they would soon put a period to this Controversie . Pray Gentlemen, be pleased to speak a little to this Case for the sake of this poor Heathen ; who presently consented thereto. Sir Sublime Matter made out,    [   The Sublime Matter of the Holy Scripture proves its Authority.  ] That the Contents or chief Things contained in the Breast of Sir Sacred Scripture , were so transcendently Divine and Mysterious, that his Authority must of necessity be from the King of Heaven and Earth. II. Sir Ancient Antiquity shewed,    [   The Antiquity of the Scripture, shew its Authority.  ] That his gray hairs declared him to be the Off- spring of God; his Writings being the first that ever were in the World: That Orpheus, Homer, Trismegistus, Pythagoras, Berosus , and all humane Writers, Poets, Philosophers, Historians and Lawgivers , were but Punies to Moses . III.   [   The Power it hath upon mens Spirits, shews, that it is from God.  ] Sir Authoritativeness of the Spirit , speaking in and by him, declared, that he was of God; who insisted much upon his inimitable Style, his speaking being with Majesty, and that his singular Simplicity, and peculiar Properties were no where else to be found. IV.   [   The infinite Holiness and Purity of the Scripture , doth the same.  ] Sir Excellent Holiness shewed that his Authority was not to be doubted of; he teaching a Doctrine every where directly opposite to the whole Corporation of debauched and wicked men, and destructive to all Impiety and corrupt Principles and Practices whatsoever; his chief tendency being to promote God's Honour, and mans present and future. Happiness; he being so pure as not to endure the evil Thoughts and Lusts of the Heart, threatning all Vice and Wickedness with Eternal Death. V.    [   The Sweet Harmony of all the Books of Holy Scripture, prove [illeg.]s Authority.  ] Sir Sweet Harmony clearly made out his Authority was of God, by shewing that though there were so many Books written, and by different Persons, and of various Conditions, living in several Ages and Places, and though not written in one and the same Language; yet all agreed with each other, and every part with the whole; and therefore could not be foreseen or contrived by any humane Wisdom, or Cunning, in composing any Branch or Part of him. VI.   [   The Credit of the Penmen , another Evidence of the Authority of Gods Word .  ] Sir Credit of the Penmen did his part well, by shewing, that the Writers of the Sacred Scriptures, were good men, and could not be otherwise; for wicked men would never write so clearly against their own Interest; and no good man would Father that upon God, which was the Contrivance of his own Brain. Moreover, The Penmen were never suspected of Imposture; some of them being Kings, and of deepest Learning, it could not be supposed should be guilty of such a mean-Spirited Baseness, as Lying and Forgery . Besides, their relating their own Infirmities, shewed (said he) their Plain-heartedness. VII.    [   Scripture-Prophecies fulfilled, prove its Authority .   ] Sir Prophecies fulfilled , demonstrated the Authority of the Judge clearly, by making out the many things the Sacred Scriptures did foretel should come to pass, in such and such Ages, were accomplished exactly accordingly; particularly, he insisted 1. upon the Prophecy of old Jacob , concerning the Scepter not departing from Judah, & c. 198 2\. That remarkable Prediction of the Prophet Isaiah , touching Cyrius . 3. The Prophesies of Daniel , and St. John in the Apocalypse , concerning the Apostacy , and wicked Usurpations and Cruelties of Mrs. Babylon ,  &c. VIII.   [   Strange Miracles his Testimony.  ] Sir Strange Miracles confirmed the Judges Authority (according to what we have already noted upon that account) though much more might be added; sith many of those Miracles wrought by Moses and also by Jesus Christ ,  &c. are acknowledged both by the Jews and Heathens , and could never be gainsayed by any Adversary. IX.    [   Wonderful Preservation of the Holy Scripture, proves the Authority thereof.  ] Sir Wonderful Preservation of the Holy Bible , shewed the Divine Authority of the Sacred Judge , viz. That God was the Author and Parent of him, sith his special Care and Providence was always in a signal manner over him and that it could not be imagined that God would ever suffer one to continue so long falsly pretending his Name and Authority, especially considering the multitudes of strong and fierce Enemies he hath had in every Age of the World, & c. How (said he) do Learned men accuse Time of Injuries, for swallowing up the Works of many famous Authors, and bewail the loss of divers of Livy's Decades , and other choice Books, which are now no where to be found? Nay, tho the Romans were so careful for the preservation of the Writings of the Sybils , that they lock'd them up in places of greatest Safety, and appointed special Officers to look after them; yet many Ages since they are gone, and only some few fragments now remain of them; whereas (saith he) the Sacred Scripture (as Sir Ancient Antiquity proved) was the first Book that ever was in the World: And though the Craft of Satan, and Rage of Mankind, have from time to time combin'd together utterly to suppress him; yet he hath born up his Head and remains alive to this day. I might mention Antiochus Epiphanes , before Christ, and the Tyrant Dioclesian , since Christ came, who did their uttermost to burn and destroy him. Also he spoke of the fearful Judgments that have befell many, who have been violent Opposers and Blasphemers of him. Besides, how strange is it, that God should tie up the hands of the Antichristian Church (amongst whom he a long time dwelt) from offering greater Violence to him than they have; since 'tis evident how inconsistent, and contrary their Principles and Practices are unto him, and what a severe Enemy he is against them. X.   [   Gracious Success of the Scripture , proves it is Divine.  ] Sir Gracious Success shewed, that the Gospel or Sacred Scripture must be of God, considering how wonderfully he hath triumphed over all oppositions of the World and Devil; and how in his very Infancy he marvellously prevailed where- ever he came, though all the Powers of Earth and Hell were against him, having no Kings, Emperors, nor Temporal Supporters on his side, and but a few poor and simple Persons, Illiterate Fishermen, Tent-makers ,  &c. to take his part, and stand by him; but was forc'd to strive against Wind and Tide, meeting continually with the vaunting Affronts of fleshly Wisdom, who laught him to scorn, for teaching a Doctrine so much against the Interest of all carnal men, and above the reach of their Humane Reason, Learning and Philosophy ; yet he made his way wonderfully, and subjected many in most Nations to the Obedience of the Cross. XI.    [   Internal Evidence and Efficacy of the Scriptures prove their Divinity.  ] Sir Inward Evidence and Efficacy of the Spirit , rais'd internal Trophies to the Honour of the Sacred Scripture , by proving what mighty power he always had, and still hath upon mens Consciences, in that, saith he, he converts the Soul, enlightens the Eyes, convinces of Sin, confutes, kills , and terrifies Gainsayers, rejoyceth and comforteth the Spirit , and maketh manifest the very thoughts of the Heart . Is it possible (said he) that such a Tree, bearing such wonderful Fruit, should be planted by any other hand, than the hand of God himself, who can speak such Words that restrain and repell all the Powers of Darkness. XII.   [  Testimony of the Church and Martyrs. ] Sir Testimony of the Church , and Holy Martyrs , who sealed to the Truth with their Blood, proved Sir Sacred Scripture's undeniable Authority; so that we may as well question whether God ever had a Church in the World, as to doubt of this great Point, viz. Whether the Holy Bible be of God or no (sith all that ever truly assumed that Name, bear witness to him) and also with open mouth declare all the innumerable multitude of the Saints and blessed Martyrs, Fools and Impostors; seeing they all in the midst of the Flames, avowed the Scriptures to be the Sacred Word of God . XII.   [   Heathen Acknowledgment's Testimony.  ] Sir Heathen Acknowledgment performed his part also very well; proving how Ovid acknowledged the Creation of the World , according to Gen. 1\. 2. And that the long Lives of the Patriarchs, before the Flood , was owned by Manetho , the Egyptian, Berosus , the Caldean , and others. That there was such a man as Moses , is testified by many Humane Records , among the Heathen Egyptians, Ph aenicians, Caldeans and Grecians . The Star that appeared at the Birth of Christ ,  199 is spoken of by Pliny . The great Historian Tacitus , speaking of Christians , saith, The Author of that Sect was Christ . The Slaughter of the Infants by Herod , is mentioned by Macrobius , To these I might mention (saith he) the Testimony of Josephus , the Jew ; who declared, That, in those days there was one Jesus, a wise man (if it be lawful to call him a man) for he was a Worker of Miracles ,  &c. XIV.   [   Antichristian and Diabolical Opposition against the Scripture , proves it Divine.  ] Sir Antichristian and Diabolical Opposition shew'd, that had not Sir Sacred Scripture received his Authority from God, wicked men and the Devil would never have opposed him, as they have done; for if a Cheat and Forgery, nothing doubtlesly could better further Satan's Kingdom. But how Satan, & c. strives, and hath always against him, not only to hinder his prevailing Power in the World, but also upon mens Hearts, is evident unto all; and therefore he is doubtless of God. No sooner had they done, but the Prisoner was again commanded to Plead. Clerk. Sin , What dost thou say; Guilty , or Not Guilty ? Sin . Not Guilty? Cryer , Call Adam , late of Paradise . Here he is, My Lord. Judge . Come, Old Father , What can you say against the Prisoner at the Bar? Adam . My Lord, I have this to say;    [   Adam's Evidence against Sin . ] First, That he made me become a Rebel and Traytor to the King's Majesty, my most Glorious Sovereign, and ever blessed Creator: For though it is true, Apollyon did first entice me by his Subtilty, to Rebel; yet had it not been for this foul Monster , he could have done me no hurt. 'Twas Sin , My Lord, that overcame me, and caus'd me to break that Law of my Creator, and so to set up, believe, and subject to the Devil, rather than God; and by this mean he robb'd me of Gods Image (for he is a Thief, as well as a Traytor) Nay, and not only so, but he robb'd me of Union and Communion with God too, and made my Creator become mine Enemy; yea, it was for his sake that I was turn'd out of Paradice : And that which is also very grievous to me to think upon, he, by that one Act, murdered me (in a base and horrible manner) and all my Posterity, both Soul and Body. I could say much more, and aggravate his Crime under ten or twelve Particulars. Judge . Father, I know it very well; but this is sufficient Here you prove him a Traytor, Rebel, Thief, and bloody Murderer; and not only a Murderer of the Body, but of the Soul; and likewise of the Bodies and Souls of all men and women that now live, and ever lived upon the Earth. Cryer , Call Mrs. Soul of Manshire . Soul . Here, My Lord. Judge . What can you say, Most Noble Lady, against Sin , the Prisoner at the Bar? Soul .    [   Mrs. Souls Evidence.  ] My Lord, I was at first the fairest and beautifullest Virgin that ever had a Being on Earth, and was the Praise of God's Creation ; in whom his own Image most gloriously shone forth: There was, My Lord, no stain, spot, nor ill feature in my lovely Face; and all my Faculties were pure holy and chaste, being free from the least Tincture of Filth, Folly or Corruption ; but this Hellish and Bloody Villain , the Prisoner at the Bar , secretly stole upon me, and in a shameful manner defil'd me; and not only so, but put out my Eyes, and wounded me in a barbarous manner in every part; and he being a rotten and filthy Monster, I was poysoned by him; so that I am now covered all over with Corruption and loathsom Stink, insomuch that if any did but behold me in the state this Enemy hath left me, they would loath to look upon me. Nay, My Lord, he hath given me my Death's Wound too; for as I am a Spirit , he has spiritually slain me, by depriving me of the Life and Light of Gods sweet Countenance, which once I enjoyed; so that I lie as one dead in the cursed Arms of this polluted Monster. And moreover, My Lord, I had but one poor Cottage left me to dwell in, and the Prisoner at the Bar turn'd me out of it, and exposeth me to be cast into a Lake of Fire . Judge . Poor Lady, I pity thy State; for what thou saist, I know to be true, and much more; for I might call all thy Faculties to give in their witness, were there any need of it. Cryer Call Mr. Body of Manshire . Body . Here, My Lord. Judge . What can you say Mr. Body against Sin , the Prisoner at the Bar ? Body . My Lord, I was once a very Lovely Creature, none exceeded me in God's nether Creation, save that precious Lady (and Companion of mine) who spoke last; I had no blemish in me, being as sound as a Fish, having health without sickness, strength without weakness; my labour also was without wearisomness. In a word, I was in a perfect state, and needed nothing to make me happy; being also free from all things that could annoy or disturb me: But, Lo! on a sudden this Villain, the Prisoner at the Bar, by his Hellish Subtilty, overcame poor Lady Soul , who dwelt with me; and presently next to her, poor I went to the Walls; for he brought in upon me a whole Army of evil Humors, which so corrupted my Blood,  &c. that I am invaded and continually plagued with all manner of sad tormenting and loathsom Diseases; with Blindness, Deafness, Lameness, &c. so that my Life is but Pain and Wearisomness to me; when 'tis night, I cry, O, when will it be morning? and when 'tis morning, I cry, Would to God it was Evening. My Lord, 'tis he that hath brought this upon me, and more than this; for he hath let in another Enemy upon me, that grinds me ere he had done, as small as Dust; nay, makes meer Dung and Filth of me, which men loath to look upon; for Worms breed on me, and therefore they cover me under ground: Nay my Lord, he tears my poor little Babes to pieces, by grievous Diseases, as, Convulsions, Small Pox ,  &c. and sends then from the Breasts to the Grave , without any pity. Judge . Poor Body , This Villain hath Made thy condition sad indeed. Cryer . Call Whole Creation . Here he is. Judge, Creation , What can you say against Sin? Creation .    [   The whole Creation called to give in Evidence against Sin .  ] My Lord, a great deal. First, My Ground, that was made good, is now by him become barren and unfruitful: Nay, for his sake, my great Creator hath curs'd me so, that I bring forth Bryars and Thorns, and many other hurtful and venomous Creatures. Nay, My Lord, my Earth is through him defiled under the Inhabitants thereof, and my Heavens are not clear in God's sight, he is such a polluted Monster; also my Stars , by their evil and angry Influences, in their Courses, fight oft-times against Mankind, and other Creatures at the Command of their Creator: And my Air likewise is frequently so corrupt, that it infecteth Humane Bodies; yea, and my Fire and Water many times destroy wonderfully; and my poor Cattle , by him are filled with bitter Rage and Cruelty one against another, each one tearing and devouring his Fellow: Besides, he makes them serve with unmerciful Tyranny , the Creature Man , till they groan under their heavy Burdens; especially, my poor Camels, Asses, Oxen , and Horses , being cruelly lash'd, gor'd and mangled by him; nay, and it was through him that their Flesh was given for Food, by which means Millions of Millions of my poor pretty Lambs, Sheep, Doves , and all other Innocent Creatures are every year without mercy slain and butchered; for Adam in innocency (before he was overcome by this Prisoner) was to feed of every Tree of the Garden (save one) which yielded him (no doubt) better food than the Flesh of these poor Creatures. Judge . Alas, poor Creation , I pity thee with my whole heart. O cruel Tyrant! But it will not be long ere thou art delivered from the bondage of Corruption , into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God . Cryer , Call in Mr. Decalogue of Mount Sinai . Here, My Lord. Judge . What can you say, Mr. Decalogue , against Sin the Prisoner at the Bar? Decal.   [   Mr. Decalogue's Evidence.  ] My Lord, a great deal. 1\. I am (as you know) that holy and just Law which Jehovah gave forth to restrain and curb this cursed Traytor ; but he hath in a fearful manner torn, broke, and wickedly violated me in every Part and Branch of me. I command but one, who is the True God , to be worshipped; but he hath set up, and made Many Gods , who are adored with the same Divine Adoration that is due to him only. 2\. I forbid Images ,  &c. but he in despight of me, hath took this my just Command quite away, and has introduced many Images , and caused People in an Idolatrous manner, to fall down and worship them. 3\. I command none to take Gods Name in vain ; but he teaches Men, Women and Children to Swear, take his Sacred Name in vain , and Blaspheme it every day in a lamentable manner. 4\. I teach, One Day in Seven to be kept Holy , but [illeg.] teaches men to break this Law, and regard no Day Religiously to the Lord. 5\. I teach Children to obey their Parents ; but he makes them stubborn, heady, and in a wicked sort to Rebel against their Parents, and not to fear or stand in aw of them. 6\. I forbid Murther , and that one man should not kill another; but he fills them with Hatred and Malice in such a sort against their Fellow- Creatures, that they murder and kill one another in a most grievous and merciless manner. 7\. I forbid Adultery ; but he causes Men and Women to be filled with Incest, Sodomy, Buggery , and all manner of Adultery, Fornication and Uncleanness . 8\. I command all not to bear false Witness against their Neighbors ; but he hath rais'd up wicked Villains to forswear themselves; not only to the taking away of their Neighbours Goods and good Name, but their Lives too. 9\. I command all that they steal not; but he teaches men to rob and steal both privately and publickly. 10\. I command all not to covet their Neighbours Houses, Wife, Ox, nor Ass, nor any thing that is his ; but he teaches men to desire and covet every thing their poor Neighbor have, to their utter undoing. Now by reason that all these just Laws of mine are broke and violated by him, the whole world is brought under Gods fearful wrath, who says, Cursed is he that continueth not in all things that I command, to [illeg.] them ; and this in short, is what (My Lord) I have to say. Cryer . Call Mr. Evangelist . Here my Lord . Mr. Evangelist . What can you say against Sin? Look,   [   Mr. Evangelist's Evidence.  ] says the court, he is ready to swoon, and Tears stands in his Eyes; give him some Spirits: but he soon came to himself. Judge. Evan. What ailed you that you could not speak before. Evan. My Lord, My Heart sunk in me to see this vile Villain at the Bar; but I am glad he is brought to his Tryal. Judge . Why what is the matter; what hath he done? Evan.   [   How grievously Sin abused, and wounded, and murdered Jesus Christ .  ] Done, my Lord! he hath by wicked hands Crucified and Slain thy Lord of Life and Glory : 'Twas this Bloody Monster , that murdered my dear Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ . For first , He was sent into the World to die , 'tis true; but 'twas because of the hainous Nature of this Villain ; he causing Mankind so to offend God , that nothing but the Blood of my dear Lord could satisfie for their Offences : But when he came he stirred up the Jews , and other evil and Graceless . Persons; who Villified him, Scourg'd him, Crown'd him with Thorns, Spit in his Face ; and in a Cruel and Barbarous manner murder'd him; but that is not all, this Enemy put his Soul to great and lamentable pain in the Garden; he lay so heavy upon him, that he made him sweat as it were drops of Blood , falling down to the Ground; and caused the Father also to hide his Face from him, which made him cry out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me ? I cannot speak what I have to say; my Heart is ready to break? Upon this all the Court were in amaze; Lord , says one, what a Malefactor have we here. Cryer . Call in the King's own Daughter, the Blessed Spouse and Wife of the Lamb : Here my Lord. She appeared in her mournful Garments, yet all Glorious within ;  200 and her Cloathing was wrought Gold . Judge . What can you say most Virtuous Lady , against Sin the Prisoner at the Bar. Kings Daughter . My Lord,    [   Zions Evidence.  ] I have many things to Witness against him. First , He did what lay in him, to hinder my being Espoused to Jesus Christ , my Lord and glorious Husband , because Apollyon feared the holy Issue I should bear him, would be for ever his Mortal Enemies (as indeed they always were, are, and ever will be. Secondly , No sooner at any time, that I have brought forth any Child of the New Covenant , but he with an open Mouth seeks to devour it; and if he cannot do that, then he labours to spoil its Growth , and deface its Beauty . Moreover, He hath most grievously divided my Children, filling their Hearts with evil thoughts one against another; raising up Discord and Animosities amongst them, to the great Grief and Trouble of my Spirits , Dishonour of God , reproach of the Gospel , and encouragement of my Enemies ; and not only by their sad Divisions doth he do this, but also by his Subtilty he preys so upon them, and gets such power over them, that he hinders their sweet Communion and Fellowship , both with the Father and Son ; causing some of them to walk Loosly, Carnally , and altogether unbecoming the Gospel ; by which means I am rendered very odious in the Eyes of many People. But that which I have further to say, is this; The Bloody Tyrant , in former time, stirred up Pharaoh King of Egypt to oppress me, and so hardened his heart against me, that many of my little Babes , he caused to be thrown into Rivers; and divers other ways he sorely afflicted me then, and in after- Times; and like an unsatisfied Monster , as he is, hath never quite ceas'd to this Day, from contriving and executing all manner of Villanies upon me and my Children, so that by many strange and cruel Deaths he hath slain Thousands of Thousands of them in most Countries and Kingdoms of the World. And the more Holy and Godly any have been, the more they have suffered by him, and one Mrs. Babylon ; that he has raised up against me, my Lord, such a Savage, Blood-thirsty Wretch , he is, that he hath hang'd, burn'd, stoned and tortured, sawn asunder, cast into the fiery Furnace , into Lyons Dens, tore in pieces with wild Horses, plucked out the Eyes of poor Men and Women, roasted and bury'd alive, imprisoned, gagged, starved, cursed ; and many has he forced to flye into Woods, Desarts , and remote Places ; having deprived Parents of their Children, Children of their Parents , the Husband of the Wife , aud the Wife of the Husband , shewing no pity , nor Bowels , on the destituted, afflicted, tormented Ones, whom he and his Party forc'd to wander in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins , in Mountains, Dens and Caves of the Earth : My Lord, my spirits begin to fail me, and my Soul and Bowels tremble at the sight and thoughts of him; 'tis impossible I shonld now recite the hundred part of what I have to charge him with: But here is a credible Gentleman, in the Court, called Ancient and Modern Records ; who can make out much more against him than what I have said. Judge . Poor Zion , I pity thy sorrowful Condition; but do not be discouraged, his Time is but short. Cryer . Call in Mr. Ancient , and Modern Records of the Country of Humane . Mr. Ancient ,    [   Mr. Record's Evidence.  ] and Modern Records , &c. Here. Judg. Come, what is that you can testifie against Sin? Ancient Records . Waggoners, whip on. Judge . What do you mean; is this a fit answer for one of your years in such a Place? Ancient . My Lord, I have here at hand more than a Hundred Waggon-Loads of Books, which are of good Credit; that are filled full of the Horrid Deeds of this Bloody Villain at the Bar, if you will be pleased to have them read. Judge . That is impossible to be done now; 'tis a Work for many years; you must repeat some particulars. Mr. Ancient, &c. My Reader can do it my Lord. Judge . What is his Name? Ancient Records . His Name is Historian . Cryer . Call him in. Historian . Here. Judge . What have you to say against Sin the Prisoner at the Bar. Friend , You must be brief in your Evidence . Historian . My Lord, I have read much of Mr. Ancient and Modern's Testimony; I mean, the Writings of worthy Men, who lived in several Ages of the World; whose Credit and Authority is generally received by all; and there I find such an account given of the Acts, Deeds and Cruelties of this Enemy at the Bar, that 'twould make a Man tremble to think of: For he hath caused most horrid Treasons, Plots, Conspiracies, Rebellions, Wars, &c. Setting one Kingdom against another, Neighbour against Neighbour, the Father against the Son, and the Son against the Father; yea, he hath filled the whole Earth with all manner of Filth, and cursed Debauchery, Blood and Violence. Stealing, Cheating, Deceiving and Destroying both Body and Soul too , hath been I find all his practice; so that he hath not only been a Plague to the Church , but also to the whole World; having caused (by reason of his vile and detestable Deeds which he hath done, or caused to be committed) the Majesty of God , to send sad and fearful Judgments oftentimes upon all those Places, Nations, Cities and Towns where he has been received, loved, countenanced, kindly and universally embraced, as Famine, Sword and Pestilence ,  &c. so that divers great and glorious Nations, Cities, & c. have through him been made quite desolate, depopulated and spoiled; of which I could give you a particular account, if your Lordship please to hear it. Judge . No Mr. Historian , you have said enough. Cryer . Call Theologue . Here, my Lord. Judge . Sir, you are summonn'd hither to give in your Testimony against Sin ; pray therefore, in a concise manner, open what evils you know he hath done, or is guilty of, whether they are Treasons, Murders, Fellonies ,  &c. Theologue . My Lord, that I am ready to do. First ,    [   Mr. Theologue's Evidence against Sin .  ] I shall proceed somewhat in a different manner (as to my Evidence against him) to those worthy Persons who have been already called. My Lord, he is so vile and evil, that there is no good in him; he is indeed, the Plague of Plagues ; we had far better God should let in upon us all his fearful Judgments, as Famine, Pestilence and Sword, &c. than to give us up to the Rule, Tyranny , and Dominion of this Villain and Enemy Sin . First , There is some Good in Affliction , but none in Sin . Hence David said, It was good for him that he had been afflicted ; and indeed, his Afflictions consisted both in Sword and Pestilence, &c. but St. Paul saith, In me , that is in my Flesh, dwells no Good : He calls Sin an Inmate, a Dweller in him, but such a one that had no Good in him. 2\. Afflictions oftentimes are made as Channels to convey Mercies and much Good to Men; By this shall the Iniquity of Jacob be purged ,  201 &c. that is, by Afflictions ; but Sin is never sanctified by the Lord to do good; nay, Sin is so evil, it is not capable of any Work of God to sanctifie it for good and therefore worser than any Affliction . 3\. There is no good Principle from whence this Tyrant comes; Afflictions come from God , but Sin comes from the Devil : 'Tis a sign God loves us when he afflicts and chastises us ; but not to be punish'd when we sin & grievously offend God , is a sign of God's Hatred; therefore 'tis said, 202 I will not punish their Daughters when they commit Adultery . When God lets out his Wrath to purpose on Men, he is said to leave them to their own Hearts Lusts , to walk in their own Councel . 4\. There is a Promise made to Afflictions; I will be with you in the Fire, and in the Water ; but there is no promise made to Sin , but contrariwise, threatned Wrath and the Curse . 5\. Afflictions , are Signs of Adoption; Whom the Lord loves he chastiseth ;  203 but so is not Sin ; that is rather a sign of Reprobation . 6\. We may kiss the Rod when Afflictions come, and rejoyce in it, and bless God for it; but it would be an abominable thing thus to do, in respect of Sin ; and therefore it is worser than Afflictions . Secondly, Sin , the Prisoner at the Bar, is opposite to God , or his direct Contrary. 1\. Opposite to the Nature of God ; nay, and there is nothing indeed so contrary to his pure Nature as Sin is; for there is nothing else except Sin , but Originally it is from God , by him and for him; and therefore cannot be properly said to be directly contrary to him; but Sin is neither from him, nor by him, nor for him, therefore the worst of Plagues , and greatest Enemy to God in the World. 2\. This Tyrant hath and doth still resist God in his Authority, Sovereignty and Dominion over his Creatures; his Voice is, God shall not Reign ; he hath all along endeavour'd, to set up the Will of Sorry man , the Will of the Flesh ; nay, the Will of the Devil , above the Will of God . 3\. Jehovah doth not account Sin only according to a Mans Intention in sinning , but according to what the Nature of Sin tends unto: They that open, or have opened their Doors or Hearts to this Enemy, are called Haters of God; There is the end of the Agent, and the end of the Act , whatever the Sinner may think; yet for his liking, loving and living in Sin , he is justly called a Hater of God ; thus God accounts of Sin ; and besides, the lesser love is accounted Hatred ; so that they that love Sin more than God , they hate God . 4\. Sin is Rebellion ; and he hath made all that adhere to him to become Rebels and Traytors to the God of Heaven and Earth; for he hath endeavoured, from the Beginning of the World to turn God off the Throne , and his Vicegerent too. 5\. He is such an impudent Monster , that he strikes at God ; he flyes in his Face; nay, strikes at his very Being ; and hence, 'tis he would fain entice Men to believe there is no God ; nay, many of them that he hath deluded, have often times wished there was no God at all, that so they might without all fear, take their full swang in sensual Pleasures ; besides, it is the Nature of Contraries to seek the destruction of one another. Thirdly , This Enemy wrongs God . 1\. In his Attributes . 'Tis his Cry , and always hath been, There is not a sufficiency of Good in God to the satisfying of a Soul ; for if there is, why do men seek for Good (or in the least that which they fancy so to be) in a sinful way? if there is enough Good in God , I say why do they go to the Creature for any, in the way of Sin? 2\. Nay, this Cursed Enemy hath so wronged God , that he causeth Men to think there is more good to be had in him; I meaning in their base Lust then is to be had in God or Christ, &c. Also Men by hearkning to him, have departed from God : they have by a Choice set before them, refused God , and chose Sin this vile Enemy: Now this shews in their Opinion the Profits, Pleasures and Honours that Sin yields them is better than all the Good there is in God, &c. though in the Gospel he sets forth his own Glory, Excellency and infinite Goodness before their eyes, yet they will have none of him; they like Sin and this World far better. 3\. He wrongs God in his Wisdom ; as if God did not know how to provide so well for his Creatures Good, as he. 4\. Nay (My Lord) he also hath, and dayly doth cast Dirt upon the Holiness of God; perswading men, that though they are never so vile, God loves them; and that he is not so holy and exact, as to mind whatever they do amiss. 5\. Moreover, He hath wronged God in his Omniscience and Justice ; in tempting men to do that in the sight of Jehovah , without fear, which he hath threatned to punish with eternal Burning. 6\. He wrongs God in his Truth and Veracity also; as if all his fearful Threatnings and Comminations that are against him, were nothing but foolish Tales, or things that will never be executed; and as if all his Promises of Grace and Mercy, made unto those who repent, were a Lie, and not worth regard. Hence (My Lord) you may call all the Holy Attributes of God in to witness against him. Fourthly , Besides all this, he hath wronged God in his Personal Relations , viz. Father, Son , and Holy Ghost . 1\. He hath wronged the Father , in his Works of Creation ; in that all those Natural Gifts and Faculties bestowed upon the Soul, and Members given to the Body, are used, or rather abused by him, to God's Dishonour; also, in as much as all those outward Blessings and good things the wicked enjoy, are not improved to the end and intent of the great giver; for though they are fed by the Almighty, and have his innocent Creatures slain in abundance for them; so that they eat the Fat, and drink the Sweet , yet they live to themselves, and serve this his Enemy, and mind not the Work and Business for which he made them, and commands them carefully to do and look after. 2\. He wrongs Christ in the Work of Redemption ; not only in that he crucified him, and poured forth his Blood like Water (as my Brother Evangelist well observ'd) but in respect also he stirs up Mankind, like Swine, to trample his most precious Blood under their feet, and never regard nor mind the great end of Christ's Coming; which was to save them from their sins, and purchase to himself a peculiar People ,  204 zealous of good works . 3\. He hath, and still doth wrong the Holy Ghost in his Work of Sanctification , by resisting his Motions, striving continually to grieve and weary him out; and also by defiling the Body, which should be his Temple and Habitation ; But alas, this, he ( viz. Sin) has got, and there he reigns, and the Holy Ghost is kept out. Fifthly . This Cursed Enemy hath wronged God in that wise Councel and Order he hath set in the World. The Lord hath in an admirable manner placed and ordered all things here below, so that they might bring about his own End; which is his Glory: But this Enemy , like an evil and cursed Incendiary, doth strike at God's Work, and endeavours to break all to pieces; that so his Work being spoiled, his End might be frustrated. This is the first part of my Evidence. The Second I shall now enter upon. My Lord, This Cruel Tyrant , the Prisoner at the Bar , is the greatest Enemy and Plague to man that ever was (as well as unto God) which I shall quickly make appear. 1\. He is a great Thief and Robber ; not only a Traytor to God , but a Thief also to Man ; nay, such a notorious one, that all the whole World have been cheated, and basely robbed by him; not one man (save Jesus Christ ) have escaped his hands: Besides, they are not Pins, Toys , and Trifles he gets away from them; but the best Goods they have; never being satisfied, until he hath quite undone them, and not left them worth a Farthing; 1. he hath robb'd them of God's Holy Image . 2\. Of Union and Communion with him (as Adam before shewed.) 3\. Of his gracious Favour , or Light of his Countenance . 4\. He robs them of their Time , which should be dedicated wholly to Jehovah ; But he perswades them 'tis time enough to repent to morrow ; yet that Morrow never comes till their Souls are in Hell. 5\. He hath robbed them of the Opportunity of Time , I mean, those precious Sermons, Seasons of Grace , and Holy Sabbaths God hath been pleased to afford them; insomuch that he hath made them to prefer Worldly Advantage and Profit in their Shops and Callings, above the Riches of the Gospel ,  &c. 6\. He hath robb'd them of True Peace , and Joy in the Holy Ghost . 7\. He has cheated them of all the great Blessings of a Crucified Christ , and of their own precious and immortal Souls , and of that Crown of Glory which fadeth not away . Secondly . He is not only a great Thief and Robber , but a bloody and merciless One too; he hath bound them all in his Bonds of Iniquity ; and not only so, but hath put out all their Eyes , and stript them of their Rayment , and wounded them in a cruel manner from the Crown of their Head ,  205 to the Soles of their Feet (as hath already been shewed. 4\. He is a crafty and cunning Thief ; 1. He cheats them of Treasure of inestimable value, for meer Toys and Trifles. 2. He deceives them of their Reason; perswading many People, though they sow Tares, yet they shall reap Wheat; nay, though they sow not at all, yet they shall have a good Crop at Harvest; and that it is time enough to sow, when it is the time (indeed) they should reap. 4\. He is a bold Thief ; he hath adventured to steal away the Thoughts of good People in the very face of Justice; even when by Christ's Ministers he hath been Arraigned for his horrible Wickedness. 5\. He is an old Thief ; he began betimes; above 5000 years ago, and will not cease yet. 6\. He is a strong Thief also; very few are able to Master him: Nay, none can without power from above. II. As he is a Thief to Mankind, so he is likewise such a filthy and unclean Beast , that he hath defiled them, and all things they meddle withal: besides that horrible Guilt he brings upon them. III. He hath wounded the Soul of Man. IV. He hath debased Mans Soul , which is of a most Noble Extraction . V. He hath separated God from Man, and hid his Face from him, and spoiled him, and laid him under the Sentence of Eternal Burning . VI. He is to Mankind , my Lord, the Evil and Poyson of all other Evils; no Evil could hurt them were it not for him; nor would be so bitter to them, but might be easily born. Nay, He makes the best things they enjoy bitter to them. My Lord, He hath a kind of Infiniteness of Evil in him. 1\. Because he teaches Men to rebel against an infinite God . 2\. Because the wrong he hath done cann't be aton'd for without an infinite price. 3\. There is nothing but Infinite Power can overcome him. 4\. He hath made an infinite breach between God and Man. 5\. He deprives the Soul of an infinite good. 6\. And lastly, he doth bring upon Man infinite pain and punishment. And this My Lord, is the substance of what I have to say against him. Judge . I thank you good Mr. Theologue , you have performed your part well. Cryer . Call Madam Grace , and all her Daughters, Faith, Hope, Charity, Patience, Prudence, Temperance, Sobriety, Chastity, &c. Here my Lord we are all. Judg. Come virtuous Lady, what can you say for my Sovereign Lord the King against the Prisoner at the Bar? Grace . My Lord, I am of a Noble Descent and Parentage , being begotten and born from Above ; but this Villain , as much as lay in him, endeavoured to hinder both my Conception and Nativity . 1\. And no sooner am I brought forth, but he strives to obstruct my Growth, and to choak me with the love and delights of this World, 2\. By raysing up a base Fellow to do it, called Slavish Fear (a Bastard of his own begetting.) 3\. By taking away, or with-holding from me the sincere Milk of the Word . 4\. By causing my Children not to hunger after it as they ought to do. 5\. He causes me to be slighted, neglected and grievously reproached as if I were not worthy to be regarded, nor cherished. 6\. By setting up and exalting one called Morality , equal with me, if not above me; by which means, my Lord, I lose much of my Glory: I have more to say, but I will leave the rest to my Daughters to make out. Cryer . Call Mrs. Graces eldest Daughter, Saving Faith . Here, My Lord. Judge . Most precious Faith , What have you to say? & c. Faith . this Villain my Lord, hath by many cunning Devices made me so contemptible as if I were of no higher Pedigree, than of a Humane Extraction, or begotten of refined Nature, 2\. He has made me so feeble and weak (by hindring me of that good Nourishment God hath provided for me) that I can scarce go alone; he lies so heavy upon me, that I can hardly look up; He makes my Children also to pore more upon their own inward Corruption , than upon Christ's Righteousness and blessed Mediation , to their great wrong; besides, he turns their Eyes more to Mount Sinai , than to Mount Zion ; more upon the Law than upon the Gospel ; also he makes them so idle and careless, that they do not pray oft and fervently enough for me that I might be strengthened, and flourish in them: Moreover, he lets in upon me, oftentimes, one Despond ; who, like a merciless Tyrant , knocks me down at one blow. Pray call my Sister Hope . Judge. Fair Damsel , What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar. Hope .    [   Mrs. Hopes Evidence.  ] My Lord he hath often forc'd me almost to let go my Anchor -hold, by which means the poor Ship, Soul , hath been upon the rough Waves of a Tempestuous Sea ,    [   Hope , in danger of her Life for want of Experience & Patience  ] and in danger every hour of being broken in pieces, and utterly lost upon the pernicious Rocks of either Presumption or Despair . Besides, My Lord, he hath very near in time of very great Tribulation, destroyed my two Sisters, Patience and Experience ; who always are very helpful to me; for you know who says, Tribulation worketh Patience, and Patience Experience and Experience Hope , Rom. 5, 3, 4, 5. That way I use to be strengthened; but by spoiling them, he hath weakned me. Judge . Is this so Mrs. Patience? Patience . Yes, my Lord, for in times of Tribulation , this Enemy hath let in one Discontent , and his Brother Repine ; by which means, I was turned out of doors, and lost the help of Experience , who is a dear Friend to my Sister Hope . Judge . Were ever Virtuous Damsels thus basely used? Mrs. Charity , What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar? Charity . Alas, my Lord, this cursed Tyrant, Iniquity , hath so prevailed, that I am become as one almost dead ; whosoever feels me, shall find me even Clay-cold . I am, my Lord, through his means also grown much out of Esteem; most being weary of my Company. Besides, I and all my Sisters stand in fear of our Lives; for as he goes by the Name of Covetousness , he hath attempted to murther us all together: Nay, and he hath put out of joynt both the Arms of my Sister Bounty , and almost broken my Back and the Back of my Sister Liberality , and hath forced poor Hospitality out of doors, and set all People so against her that none hardly will know her, or take her in. But, my Lord, This is not all; he has got another Design against me: he teachs men to break Gods Law , and do such things that are a reproach to Religion , and the[illeg.] Fathers it upon me, as if I taught men to sin against God and violate the Law, Gospel, and their Conscience too Alas, 'tis not Love (no, no, I am more chaste and pure but Lust , that teaches men this; nay, he would need make a Ranter of me, pretending I am such a Latitudinarian , and have so large a Heart , that I teach Men and Women to have fellowship and communion together without distinction; whereas your Lordship well knows, That I am in all respects a Lover of Purity , and hate all manner of fleshly and spiritual pollution ; the holy Gospel being continually my Rule in all I lead men to do; though I cannot deny but that this Villain hath greatly wrong'd me, by filling the hearts of God's People with Strife, Envy and bitter Animosities one against another; for I would have all that are Saints , love each other, though (not I) but the Gospel , is to be the Rule of their Communion ; but Ile say no more, but give way to my Sisters, Sobriety and Temperance . Judg. Well, what can you say, Beautiful Virgins , against Sin , the Prisoner at the Bar? Sobriety, &c. My Lord, I and my Sister were employ'd to keep the House of every Christian Man , and to moderate his Mind in all his Affairs: But lo, on a sudden, this unruly Fellow, and Enemy of God and all Goodness, let in upon us a vile Wretch , called, Inordinate Desires ; who had no sooner got in his foot, but poor We went to the Walls, and were laid weltring in our Blood; for he led him out to use the Creatures to Excess in Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Recreation, Pleasures ,  &c. which our Natures could never endure. Judge . Come forth ( Chastity) Sweet-heart ; have you any thing to charge the Prisoner with? Chastity . Alas, My Lord, My heart is ready to break, to see him; for like a wicked Beast as he is, he would have committed a Rape upon me; Lord help me, my Spirits are almost gone. Judge . Give her a Cordial . Come, Damsel , What is that you say? Chastity . My Beauty is (as you see) like the Sun, and I am fairer that the driven Snow , and I have also as pure, and spotless a Mind; but this Monster , having knockt down my two poor Sisters, Sobriety and Temperance , by the Excess of Gluttony, Drunkenness ,  &c. thereby was let in two of his own base Off-spring , viz. Chambering and Wantonness ; and they had almost forc'd me: However, I lay in a great deal of danger, and hardly escaped with my Life. Nay, my Lord, and besides this, he hath continued so many Antick and base Fashions, that he hath even murthered (I fear) my Sister Modesty ; and by means of bare Necks, Breasts and Shoulders ,  &c. I am every day in great danger likewise; and not only this way, but also oft-times he exposeth me to great jeopardy by evil Company . Judge . Have you any other Sister that hath not been called? Chastity . Yea, my Lord, here is my Sister Prudence . Judge . Come Mrs. Prudence , Pray declare what you have against the Prisoner? Prudence . My Lord, he has done me as much, wrong as any of my dear Sisters; so, 'tis I who reach Men and Women to make good use of their Seasons and Opportunities for the good of their Souls and Bodies; but this cruel Tyrant hath often endeavoured to stifle me, by letting in two other Enemies and base- bred Villains, Idleness and Vain Hope ; so that the Ant , by a certain instinct of Nature learns more Wisdom in providing her Food in the Summer and gathering her Meat in Harvest , than I can teach Mankind. Nay, my Lord, I can hardly (now adays) find a Service , (though none of the worst Houswives ) in City or Countrey; for if People would entertain me, I would soon cloath them all with Silk and Purple; and make them Coverings of Tapestry : I am not afraid of the Snow, nor doth my Candle go out all night , Prov. 31. 19, 21, 22. Judge . I know, Prudence , thou art a painful Maiden: Many Women have done vertuously, but Thou and thy Sisters have excelled them all . I accept of thy Evidence , and will see Justice done Thee and them too, with a vengeance. Cryer , Call Mr. Conscience . Here, My Lord. Judge . Come, Conscience , What can you say for our Sovereign Lord the King , aga'nst Sin , the Prisoner at the Bar? Conscience . There hath, my Lord, been a great de[illeg.]aid and witnessed against him already; but I can (nevertheless) charge him with such kind of horrid Crimes that none knows of besides me and the Majesty of Heaven: He is truly, a Monster of Wickedness , in committing all Deeds of Darkness ; for though he is impudent enough , yet there are some of his Treasons, Murders, Incests, Adulteries , and horrible Combinations , that Apollyon himself is ashamed, or rather afraid should come to light; he hath erected, My Lord, his Throne in the House of one Mrs. Heart , and there he foments, hatches and contrives all manner of heinous Crimes and unknown filthy Abominations ; as, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, False Witnesses, Blasphemies, Seditions, Heresies, Lasciviousness, Envy, Malice, Revenge , and what not? Matth. 15\. 19. Nay, it is a shame (indeed) to speak of those things he hath done here, and in other places of Darkness , having many a time drawn men to take cursed Oaths of Secrecy to carry on all manner of horrid Treasons, and Villanies against King and Kingdom, Church and State, God and Man. Nay, he deceives, beguiles, and secretly undoes such oft-times that seem to be his greatest Enemies, by putting them upon base and sinister Ends; making God's Mi[illeg.] to grind the Devil's Grist . And much more I could say my Lord, but that I am not willing to tire the Court. Judge . You have performed your part in few Words. Clerk . Here are many more Witnesses , my Lord, as Mrs [illeg.]mon- wealth , Goodman Poverty , Gaffer Neighbourhood ,  &c. Judge . I cannot hear them now; there hath been enough witnessed against him already: Come vile Traytor, and Monster of Wickedness, what hast thou to say for thy self, why Sentence of Death should not pass upon you? Sin . My Lord, I have much to say: Is it not sad (though I am bad) I should be abused and belyed after this Rate! Judge . Bel'yd, Villain! Wherein? Sin . My Lord, All manner of Evil that ever was committed under the Sun, is charged (by some of these Witnesses against me) whereas 'tis evident, the Devil hath been the chief Instrument that hath done great part of it . Judge . But hark Fellow, how came he to be a Devil ? [illeg.] was a good Angel at first, and therefore let us understand [illeg.] what means he is made so vile as to act any of these horrible Deeds against the God of Heaven? Did not you at first deceive him? I must tell you it hath been made very evident again and again, that you made him a Devil ; so that all the Evil and Mischief he hath done, is justly to be charged upon you; nay and you are he that furthers and upholds his Kingdom; besides, were it not for you, what hurt could he do to poor Men and Women? And 'tis you that fulfil the Will of the Devil ; and every one that gives way to you, gives way to the Devil ; and thus have you made man, that Noble Creature, a meer Slave and Drudge to the Devil ; Nay: and Have caused some to sell themselves both Body and Soul to him; and which is worst of all, you turn the Soul of Man into a Devil. Have I not chosen you Twelve, and one of you is a Devil? John 6. 70. Fear none of those things you shall suffer; Behold, the Devil shall cast some of you into prison ,  &c. Rev. 2. 10. What do you say? Are not these things so? Sin . Ay, But yet if it please you I am wronged; for much of the Wickedness that has been, and is in the World, has been occasioned by Mans own evil Heart. Judge . 'Tis a vain thing to use this Serpentine-Cunning here; pray how came the Heart of Man to be so evil; was it not a good and honest Heart before you entered into it: Come, 'tis you that have made it so deceitful and desperate wicked. Sin . I, but your Lordship well knows the World is, and hath been, a great cause of much Iniquity which is charged upon me. Judge . the World, 'tis true, is Mans Enemy, as it is become, in its Pleasures, Honours and Profits the Obiect of Lusts ; but still, 'tis you chiefly who brought this Lust into the World; by which means it proves such a great Plague to all Mortals ; for otherwise the World would never have hurt any Body, but contrariwise been a great Friend and Blessing to them. Have you any thing more to say? Sin . My Lord, I have got a Pardon here for many Crimes I am charged with; (from His Holiness ) pray let me have the benefit of a Councel to plead it for me. Judge . Who would you trust your Cause with? Sin . My Lord, Ignatius, Loyala, Belarmine ,  &c. Judge . This Court cann't admit of criminals to be Councel for a Malefactor , who hath been cashiered and degraded long ago, Yet we will give you all the fair play imaginable: Come, we will weigh the validity, or strength, of your Pardon. Pray, how came His Holiness to have the power to pardon you; since 'tis positively said, none can forgive Sins but God ; though 'tis granted a Man may forgive his Brother that has trespassed against him, so far as he is injured thereby, yet he cann't forgive the Offence, as 'tis against God ; but you are charged with the highest Treasons that ever were committed against the Majesty of Heaven ; and tho' a Sinner may be forgiven, yet Sin must dye; that was ever the sense of that just Law and Law-maker , by which you are Tryed. Sin . Good my Lord, pity me, a Psalm of Mercy ! do not cast away an Old Man; 'tis near Six Thousand Years ago since I was born. Judge . 'Tis high time therefore to rid the Soul of Man of you. I must proceed to your Sentence. Upon this the Attorney General, Divine Justice, stood up and spoke to this purpose ; My Lord, I require Judgment, not only to pass against the Prisoner, Sin , but also against the Sinner too; for they are guilty of his Crimes, before God, and it stands not consistent with his Glory and Holiness ; that they should be acquitted; therefore I in his Name will and command, that the sentence of Eternal Death do forthwith speed and pass upon them and every of them; for the Wages of Sin is no less punishment sith they have all broke that iust Law that lays them under Gods Curse, and the Damnation of Hell; neither can I acquit one Soul of them: The Jury presently found him guilty, and the Sinner too; Upon this, O the lamentable Cry that was amongst those Mortals, whose Consciences were awakened! who stood trembling at the Bar, wringing their hands; and Tears like a River gushed from their Eyes, begging upon their Knees for pardon and forgiveness in entertaining the Traveller. At last the King's Solicitor, Divine Mercy , stood up for the Prisoners, but spoke not a word in behalf of S[illeg.] the Grand Criminal ; and spoke to this purpose; Most Serene Lord, I am ordered, by his most Sacred an Eternal Majesty, to plead for these self-condemned Malefactors: for though Divine Justice can shew no favour, yet is God gracious as well as just; and hath promised forgiveness to all such Souls who repent unfeignedly, and forsake this cursed Tyrant; therefore I cannot suffer such Souls to perish. Judge . Well, to reconcile you both, and greaten your Glory equally alike, Divine Wisdom in God hath found our a happy and blessed Medium , that so he may appear as just as Justice can require, and yet as gracious as the Sinner can desire; this it is, the Lord Jesus Christ hath in the Sinners stead laid down a sufficient price to make a compensation for all the wrong these Transgressors have done, to the Law , to Justice and infinite Holiness . Therefore the Sentence is this ; Sin, thou hast been Arraigned, Tryed and found guilty of all those Bloody, Amazing and abominable Crimes, as Treason, Murder, &c. charged against the therefore every Soul who is throughly convinced of his notorious Evils, in loving, liking and entertaining of thee; and doth heartily confess and forsake thee, &c. and apply the Virtue of Christs Blood as the only Remedy, he shall live and be forgiven; but thou shalt die without Mercy; and they by the help of Gods Spirit shall crucifie thee; neither shall they have their Lives and Pardon upon any other terms; for either they must die, and thou be slain, mortified and crucified in them, and by them. But all you who do nor this (pray hear your Sentence) viz. confess, leave, loath and utterly forsake Sin , this detestable and odious Enemy; and apply the Virtue of Christs Blood as the only means which hath satisfied the Justice of God, and made an Atonement for you; but shall still love, live in, and entertain this Cursed Monster; shall everyone of you remain in the hands of Divine Wrath until you die; and then your Souls shall go to Torment, in the dreadful Day of Judgment, Bodies and Souls [illeg.], with Sin , whom you have so dearly loved, shall be cast into the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimstone, there to remain in inconceivable Torment for ever and ever; upon this, with such Joy, that no Tongue is able to conceive, some poor Souls took hold of Gods Gracious Mercy, and were pardoned; but the greatest part made light of all that was said; and seemed to set the Court at nought, being hardened in their Sins , because the Sentence against their evil Deeds was not presently executed, so that they fell into the hands of Divine Wrath and Vengeance; and are like to perish for ever and ever; and thus the Tryal is ended. FINIS.
