 of that crime, protest, That I will no more exclaime against the gods, for having so extraordinarily preserved me from death, since now I finde 'twas to preserve Artavasdes from it; for whom I am so justly concern'd, that I shall cherish the continuation of my miseries, if they contribute to the continuation of his life; which, though replenisht with many sensible misfortunes, yet are as far short of mine, as an unhappiness that time, and many accidents may, cure, is of one, which the very Gods themselves cannot. If (said Artavasdes) my miseries 'till now were not equall to yours, this assurance has made them so, for the accession to my past misfortunes, that yours transcend them, gives mine the Precedencie. Callimmachus who apprehended, this generous dispute would suspend him from learning, what would enable him to determine of it; acquainted them with his feares; to which Artabbanes told him; Alas Sir, I shall by not obeying you, doe it; for by not being able to tell you what should determine it, you cannot but doe it on my side; I am also the more concern'd in this victorie, since by the losse of it, I shalbe depriv'd of this only consolation in my miseries, that my generous friends are not equall to them. But the Night being alreadie too-far spent to begin a fresh relation, he not only perswaded them to deferr their curiositie 'till the next morning, but also to permit Symander to satisfie it; whose fidelitie had render'd him an unsuspected hearer of Artavasdes's Adventures, and whose interest in his Princes life, and secrets, render'd him a fit Relator of them. Callimmachus and Artavasdes having exprest a greater sorrow, that Artabbanes was not able to tell his own storie, than that he did it not, and a little time being spent in discourses of that qualitie, (and of the different opinions they all had what could make the Prince of Parthia so intent upon Artavasdes's Death, as to hire Assassinates to act it, which he had told Callimmachus  & Artabbanes one of them had confest with his last breath.) The generous Priest took leave of the two Friends, not only to affoard them a libertie which he apprehended his companie something limitted, but also to perform some ceremonies of his office, and to be the earlier readie to summon Symander of an engagement which he in part had alreadie so well satisfi'd, that it gave him a just impatience 'till he had done it entirely. The night therefore had no sooner resign'd hir Empire to the Sun, than Callimmachus came to Artabbanes, & Artavasdes Appartment, where he found that his fear of Incivilitie proceeded from a different cause, than from that he apprehended, for the latter of them was so far from beleeving it too- early, that he had alreadie expected him above an hour, with all the impatiencies of a concern'd friend; & the former having left Symander to satisfie his promise, was alreadie retir'd into a Gallarie contiguous to his Chamber, to avoid the hearing of his unparalleld miseries, and of observing the influence they would necessarily have, over his generous friends. Symander by Artavasdes's command, seated himself between him, and Callimmachus, & there being summon'd by them both, to continue the Relation of his Princes Fortunes, having first remember'd the generous Armenian, that by his arrivall, he had been interrupted from the persecution of them at their entrance into Rome, after the victorie of Crassus, from thence thus began his discourse, addressing it to Artavasdes. grief for the loss of a Father, which but too justly merited it, you had retir'd for a few days to Ventidius's Palace, and that my Prince was assur'd by the Chyrurgions, his wounds were in such unfortunate places, that for at least two Moons he should be unable to travell. To oblidge the generous Sillaces, who was then perfectly recover'd, and to silence those feares, which so long an absence had doubtless contracted in the fair Parthenissa, but especially in Lyndadorie, he conjur'd him to begin his journey into Parthia, and to leave his cure to the helpe of time, and of the Chyrurgions. Sillaces, though he were too much a Lover, not to esteem a separatio from his Mistress a misfortune; yet he was also too much a friend, to leave one that was so to him, in so dangerous a place,  & condition; and besides, fearing Artabbanes had made him that request, more to satisfie him, than himself, he absolutely declin'd it; but when by many pressing protestations my Prince had remov'd those doubts, it was not long after, that Sillaces (taking the benefit of a Roman Gally, which was bound from Ostia to Tyre) left Artabbanes, having first concluded amongst themselves of what he should say, and doe in Parthia, and having receiv'd from him a letter to the fair Lyndadory, so fill'd with approbations, and extolments of hir election, and of implorings in his favour, and advantage, that had she but only lov'd hir Brother, she could not but have done the like to hir Servant. 'Twas by my Princes command that I waited on the generous Sillaces to Ostia, where having seen him aboard, I return'd to Rome the same day, & passing by the Capitoll to goe to Artabbanes's lodging, I perceiv'd at the gate of it, a great confluence of people; my curiositie led me to enquire the cause of it from one who told me, it was from a Salapian Lord, who had begg'd of the Senate, the head of Spartacus, which he was then taking downe. This information made me imagine 'twas the generous Perolla, who I soon after perceiv'd all in mourning in a Chariot that was so, and neere him the fair Izadora; in the same Livorie, like the Sun in a cloud, I must confess, I had a thousand pains to abstaine from running to acquaint them with a Truth, their ignorance of which, produced such sad, and noble effects; but the belief, that the discoverie of it, was fitter to proceed from my obedience, than me, and would in that qualitie be better relisht by them, I went hastily to my Prince, and having given him an accompt of what I have you; with all the impatience which so just a concerne could inspire, he immediately commanded me to goe, & acquaint the generous Lovers where he was, and assure them, that had his wounds permitted him to pay them a visit, no other impediment should have suspended him from that dutie. As soon as I had received this order, I went to obey it, and though I came immediately after to the place where I had left them, I learnt, that having taken down the Senates grant, they were return'd with it to their Lodging, which having inquir'd out, I went thither, and sent up one of their Domesticks to let them know, a stranger desir'd the honor of seeing the, who had something of importance to acquaint them with. I stay'd not long for an answer, or admittance, and as soon as I came into the chamber, I perceiv'd the generous Lovers weeping many reall tears, over the counterfeit head of my Prince; but after that by the little noise I made, they had turn'd their sight towards me, & perceiv'd who I was; the faire Izadora by some shreeks, and a more violent weeping, demonstrated, that hir seeing of me, brought some fresh, and more sensible reflections into hir memorie, than a disfigur'd, and unknowable part of Spartacus had done; but Perolla, whose Sex dispenc't him from a proportionate excess in those effeminacies, came towards me, and told me; You see Symander, that the cruell Gods having allow'd us no other way but this, to evince our gratitude to your generous Master, we have not declin'd it; we have now nothing but this part of him, and his memorie left us, which we will cherish at a rate, that those which know it, shalbe convinc't by what we doe, what we would have done, had our powers of gratitude proportionated our cause, or our desires of it; which last we cannot more highly, or justly illustrate, than by assuring you, they equall the first; and in our transcendent losse we should receive some little relaxation, if one who Spartacus did so much esteeme of as Symander, would so much esteeme of us, as to passe his life with those who during their owne, will eternally deplore the losse of his generous Master's. Sir, (I reply'd,) I should be too-unworthy so noble an offer, had I surviv'd him in whose consideration 'tis made; No generous Perolla, Spartacus lives, and does so, so much the more happily, by how much he knowes his life is considerable to you, and will put a period to a griefe nothing can repaire, or equall, but his when I shall acquaint him with yours, and the faire Izadoras. Thereupon I made them that complement my Prince had commanded me, which they no sooner heard, than in raptures as far transcending repetition, as imitation, they both conjur'd me to bring them to a person, who by the obligations of gratitude, and virtue, they acknowledg'd themselves equally confin'd to admire, and esteeme. 'Twas by this time, about the close of the Evening, so that without any hazard they might give my Prince a visit, which when I had told them, they immediately went in their Chariot (taking me only with them) to my Prince's Lodging, where the generous Lovers continued their teares, though for a contrarie cause, to that for which they had usually shed them. 'Twas in this interview (continued Symander) that Perolla acquainted Artabbanes, how that having heard of his fatall losse at the Battell of the Trenches, & that a Head as replenisht with the gifts of the Minde, as of Nature, was ignominiously fixt on the Capitoll, both he, and Izadora, dressing their Bodies, in the livery of their Mindes, came purposely from Salapia, & had begg'd from the Senate the remainder of a person, who could not be more an Enemie to Rome, than a friend to Salapia, and them. The Senate, who alwayes esteem'd of Gratitude, as knowing they had the greatest power to create it in any, & beleeviug those that had it for their Enemies, would not want it for them, in one action, to reward, and create ours, graunted our request, with which we intended to returne, and to have rais'd such a Trophie to this part of the dead Spartacus, as should have evinced the just, & vaste esteeme we had of the Living. Perolla further told him, that since his leaving of Salapia, their Fathers had as much admir'd at their past differences, and cruelties, as others did at their present friendship, which was soe settl'd, and perfect, that it relisht not a little of what had caus'd it; and that alreadie virtue was so habituall to them, that it appear'd rather an effect of their nature, than their change. Artabbanes by many embraces to the generous Perolla, and retributions to the fair Izadora, acknowledg'd their virtue, and goodnesse, and protested he was more satisfy'd with their Fathers friedship to them, than with theirs to him, since he was more concern'd in their satisfaction, than his owne; which they could not suspect, since he evinc't it in the most pregnant testimonie. But after some other discourses of this nature, Artabbanes who remember'd the pressing desire the generous Lovers had demonstrated to learne his qualitie, & Life, & that by the discovery of the faire Parthenissa's Constancy, he esteem'd himselfe disoblig'd from any longer silence, he acquainted them with it, who no sooner heard of a Concession his former denyall, and nothing else had supprest their imploringe, by fresh impatiencyes they invited my Prince to satisfy their longing. This he did, by telling them exactly all his Adventures, in which they so justly sympathiz'd, that it invited him to doe the like, in the ioy they assum'd, at that happy intelligece he had so miraculously receiv'd from the generous Sillaces; Neither did they after the knowledge of my Princes quality, pay him any more respect, or affection; For their Gratitude, and Virtue, had render'd them uncapable of any accessions of that Nature. I will not (said Symander) so unnecessarily intrench on your attentions, as to informe you how constantly every day the virtuous Salapians visited Artabbanes, nor of the excellent entertainment their conversation gave him, for 'tis high time we should leave that Italy, which had bin the Scene of such discrepant events. To effect this the sooner, I will informe you, that the generous Ventidius being return'd from the Gulph of Tarenrum, came to my deare Master, & there acquainted him of what depriv'd him of the honor of your Company, which his Friendship for you, made him esteem a greater misfortune, than the deprivation it selfe; and indeed Ventidius, to render your precipitate departure the more excusable, render'd it so dangerously necessarie, that Artabbanes had esteem'd the Misfortune of your having left him without cause, a less one. The generous Romane upon your score, or that of virtue, so assiduously visited, and serv'd my Prince, that his obligations had no unfruitfull returne, if their designe was to acquire him really his Friendship. At length after two Moons, my deare Masters wounds were well-enough clos'd, to permit him to thinke of Parthia, and the Night before his design'd departure, Perolla (who apprehended, in a strange Country, he might not be sufficiently provided) came and brought me the richest Iewells I had ever seene, and desir'd me to carry them with me, to remedy any misadventure. I was much more satisfy'd with his care, than he was with my assurance, that Artabbanes had enough of them to supply his necessities, and with my protestations (after he had earnestly prest me to accept them for my selfe,) that I would carry away nothing of his, but the memory of his virtue. Perolla immediately after went to Artabbanes, with whom he had left the faire Izadora, where he conjur'd him before hir to permit his waiting on him into Parthia, since he, and the Gods, had left him no other way to demonstrate his Gratitude, & affection. Artabbanes absolutely refus'd this offer, and was much more troubl'd at the making it, than ever Izadora was. My memory not serving me to repeate the generous Lovers finall Civilities, I will not so much wrong their excellence, as to dress them in my own expressions; The next day after this separation, they return'd to Salapia with the false Spartacus's head, which (either to disguise the Truth, or in honor to any thing which bore that name) they caus'd magnificently to be buried, and ever after liv'd in the unimitable joys of a virtuous Love; and that those cannot be transcended by any others, is not a greater Truth, than it is, that never any more justly deserv'd them. The same morning my Prince left Rome, he went to Ostia, where the obligeing Ventidius expected him, not dareing because of his eminent qualitie, to wait on him thither, lest it might have prov'd a dangerous Civilitie. There my Prince by Ventidius's favour found an excellent Gally, well fitted and Man'd, readie to receive him, and his Commands. 'Twas aboard, that these two great Men took leave, and 'twas in that separation I discover'd charmes in the generous Romans Person, and discourse, which could be no more resisted, than sufficiently admir'd: at length having mutually vow'd a friendship as unalterable, as that they had for virtue, and confirm'd it by many strict embraces, Ventidius return'd privately to Rome, and the whole Ginge immediatly with cheerfull shouts, and vigorous stroaks, made the Gally run faster than that River it had so lately abandon'd; but the Wind blowing a steadie gale at West, exempted the Slaves from much labour, and so facilitated out intended voyage, that in twentie dayes we cast Anchor in the River Orontes, which washes the walls of Antioch; whither the same night my Prince went, having largely rewarded, the Slaves, the Marriners and the Officers of Ventidius's Gally. At Antioch having furnisht our selves, with two excellent Arabian Horses, and having learnt that the wayes thorough Syria, and Mesopotamia, were much obstructed by Crassus's Armie, which possest all the Bridges, and other considerable Passes, Artabbanes to avoid any probable impediments, determin'd to leave those two Provinces, on the South, and so by the way of Armenia and Media to get into Parthia. This was by much the more secure course, and not very much the longer. We had alreadie perform'd so much of our journey, as to the Banks of the River Corindas which runs thorough Arsacca, one of the noblest Cities in Media, and were not past eight Furlongs from it, when from the height of a little Hill, we discover'd a fight; which though not very considerable for the Number of the Combatants, yet it was for those of the dead; for of above fourtie, Two only remain'd alive, which by the richnesse, and beautie of their Armes, but much more by their Courages, demonstrated themselves to be the Chiefe of either Partie. Not farre from the Scene where this Tragedy was acting, stood a Chariot whose Horses either by designe, or accident, were running up and down the field with their Harnesses broken, and in it was a Ladie, who we thought was the Iudge, or Reward of the Victorie, and who by what we could discerne of hir, when we came nearer (for she was vail'd) seem'd too, to be a worthy cause of soe generous a Dispute. My Prince extreamly taken with such courages, and beleeving to permit them to destroy each other, would be as great a Cryme in him, as in those which endeavour'd it, pulling downe the sight of his Helmet, he rid up, and thrust himselfe betweene them, where having receiv'd on his Shield, some Blowes which their furie intended for each other, he conjur'd them both, by what they valu'd most, and by those lives which, by what he had seene of them, were too-considerable to be fruitlessely lost; That unlesse the Cause of their Quarrel were mortall, they would desist from a fight, which would give both, or one of them wounds, which would prove soe. He that wore the greene Armes, either inrag'd to lose that dawning advantage he had over his Enemie, or to be interrupted fro acting a Revenge he was very intent upo, told my Prince in a furious Tone; Who ever thou beest, that art so over-officious, know, that did I not beleeve thy care of my Enemy, proceeded from thy ignorance of his Crymes, I should by thy defending a Person so replenisht with them, leave the punishment of his, for the punishment of thine; which out of that beliefe, I will now omit; but if this declaration be not sufficient to restraine thy Assistance, thou shalt finde thy Death, in thy mistaken Charity. Then clapping Spurres to his Horse, and striking my Prince's with the flat of his Sword, he joyn'd againe his Adversarie, & so incessantly prest him, that before my Prince could come to punish the Conqueror, or defend the vanquisht, the former had past his Sword thorough the latter; who by that fatall thrust let fall his owne, and his Bridle, employing both those hands which had held them, to hold himselfe in his Saddle; The Horse finding nothing to restraine him, rann with his wounded Rider up and downe the Field; he in the greene Armour, had doubtlesse made the Death of his Enemy, the end of his victory, had not Artabbanes run after him to hinder it, which so insenc't the Stranger; that leaving his old Enemy for his new, he only said, since by undertaking my Adversaries defence thou wilt partake of his Crimes, prepare thy selfe to doe the like of his punishment; And then with an active Rage, he discharg'd some furious blowes on Artabbanes, who mov'd by this fresh accession, to his former affront, receiv'd him so briskly, that the Stranger found he had undertaken a Quarrell far more difficult, than that he had so advantagiously, & lately decided. I knew too much the Lawes of Honor, and my Princes Courage, to offer him any assistance from Mine, and therefore only continu'd a Spectator of a Combate, which though replenisht with many admirable things, yet none appear'd so justly so to me, as that Artabbanes was soe long a conquering. I must confesse, his Adversaries courage gave me inclinations for him, that the way in which he imploy'd it, might justly have exempted me from, and I had longer continu'd my admiration, had not I by chance casting my Eye on the South-side of the little Plain we were in, perceiv'd Ten Horse-men which came out of a Wood which confin'd it on that side; Two of them having observ'd the dangerous condition the wounded Gentleman was in, ran to his Assistance, one of them vaulting up behind him, up-held his tottering Bodie in his Armes, and the other leading his Horse by the Head, retook (with their Charge) the way they had come; But the remaining Eight, came a gallop towards that place where my Prince, and the Stranger, were prodigally employing their valours against each other, which united were hardly able to secure them; Their being so intent on each others ruine, made them not consider how neare their owne was, which to prevent, I ridde up and acquainted them, with what their Eyes immediately did; wherefore the Stranger more concern'd in the Ladies safetie, than in his Revenge, or hopes of Victorie, immediately told Artabbanes; Valiant Stranger, The difference betwixt us, is not of soe high a concernment, but another time may serve to decide it, and having found in your sword a virtue worthy to serve so great a Beautie as these are coming to ravish from me, I shall not scruple to desire your assistance, or at least your neutralitie; but to invite you to the former, I protest, I present you with a higher glorie by the honor of serving hir, than your Victorie over me can affoard you; & perhaps by this concession, you will conquer me a more certain, and a more facile way, than that you have now undertaken. My Prince extreamly satisfi'd with this generous proceeding, told him, If I receive any trouble from what you motion, 'tis only lest you might think I grant that to your desire, which I would to your condition, or to the Beauties you soe resolutely defend; neither can you doubt by the cause of our present. Dispute, that I would not practice for you, what I did against you. Artabbanes had not time to give him any other assurances than what his sword did, and finding it necessarie, and just, to joyne with my Prince, I did it; our Enemies, though they lost at the first charge, two of their resolutest Companions, were not neare soe much surpriz'd thereat, as to see soe strange, and sudden an union against them; but this mysterie some of them had not Life enough left to unriddle, yet the others made so vigorous a resistance, that the Stranger had lost his Life, if my Prince by the death of one of his Enemies, (which was come behind him) had not hinder'd it; I had my share in the danger, & the Victory, the first by receiving some slight wounds, and the last by killing him which gave them me: In briefe, our Enemyes surviv'd not their defeate, for the Combate ended not but with their Lives. The Stranger had no sooner done acting towards, & observ'd this truth, than he came to my Prince, and lifting up his Helmett told him; Generous Stranger, since I hold my Sword from you, the Gods forbid I should employ it against you; if I have now any designes upon you, they are not only by imitating you, to preserve your Life by the hazard of mine, but if the occasion'd were offered by the absolute losse of it. The Stranger had scarce finisht these words, when he found himselfe in my Princes Armes, who by repeating twice or thrice the Name of Sillaces, made me know 'twas that generous Prince, whom he so passionatly embrac't. You may beleeve (continu'd Symander) this accident produc't no small admiration in Artabbanes which was rais'd to a higher degree when Sillaces after knowing my Prince told him, 'twas upon his score, he had then bin fighting, and that it was against Surena. When Artabbanes consider'd he fought against his Friend for his Enemy, it rais'd in him some just repinings against the strangenesse of his destiny; but as soone as he reflected on his Enemyes being the fair Zephalinda's Brother, they were immediatly silenc't; & if anything in this encounter afflicted him, 'twas, that he had drawne his Sword against Sillaces, and not that he had done it for Surena. My Prince assur'd his generous Friend of this, who could not sufficiently admire at a Friendship so efficatious, as that it ran in a Blood; whe even one of it, had acted asmuch to create his hatred, as the other was capable of, for the raising his affection, and esteme. But Artabbanes, who was impatient of all discourses, but those which tended to the learning of his destiny in the faire Parthenissa's Condition, earnestly implor'd from Sillaces an accompt of what he knew concerning it; who reply'd, that his absence in his search, had made him but from second hands, and confus'dly learne it, but that the Beauty his Sword had so much injur'd, & so much serv'd, could give him an exact relation of all. My generous Master, who was confirm'd by that Zeale with which Sillaces had embrac't hir Service, that it was Lindadory (though he could not fancy by what strange adventures she had left Parthia and needed his Sword) went with Sillaces to the Charriot; But great Gods! what was his surprize when he found the Beauty in it was the faire Parthenissa? I cannot tell you with how many tremblings and prostrations he exprest his joy, & wonder, before he could doe either, by his words; nor can I tell you with what emotions the admirable Parthenissa found, hir Deliverer, was a more transcendent felicitie than hir Deliverance. Never (continu'd Symander) never did any mortall, appeare soe like those that are not; soe that if the Gods had not reserv'd adoration for what only was a Deitie, and not for what merited to be one, my Prince must have converted a flame of Love, into one of Devotion. His Three yeares absence had soe perfected those morning Beauties, that the light which sees every thing, never saw any so exactly accomplisht; in so much that had the Gods given eternitie to hir then Beautie, they could have given it no other accession. Artabbanes who receiv'd hir Flames as fast as hir Eyes inspir'd them, was soe entirely taken up with that employment, that he continu'd silent as long almost, as I have bin speaking; but no sooner had his words the libertie of utterance, than he told the faire Parthenissa, You see (Madam) prostrate at your feet, the unfortunate, and happy Artabbanes, the last of these in having obtain'd your Pardon, & the first in having needed it; you cannot (Madam) doubt of your Power, when, as an effect of it, after my Cryme, I dare present my selfe before my injur'd Princesse; But may I not feare I receiv'd this command from your Revenge, & not your Mercy, since to behold the Virtue, and Beautie I have wrong'd, is one of the most sensible punishments could be inflicted on me for having done it; and it had bin more just (if you had not esteem'd it otherwise because it was more easie for me,) to have executed your Revenge, than obey'd your Mercy; Neither is it a small Misfortune, that by a Cryme, I come to implore it for one; but yet by having fought against your Deliverance, you may discover my Sins against the divine Parthenissa are not my Elections, but my Fate; for nothing but soe unresistable an impulsion, could have made me either doubt hir professions, and constancie, or fought against her Interests. If (said Parthenissa) the generous Artabbanes hazarded my Deliverance by his Sword, he has establisht it by the same weapon, and abundantly repair'd a small injury, by what acted it; and if he doubted my professions, and Constancie, he was so excellently deluded into that mistake, that it had bin a greater Miracle he had avoided those thoughts, than that he assum'd them. I may professe too with the same Truth, that I fear'd as much the disclosing of my Innocencie, as he detested my seeming want of it; for I knew the discoverie of his error, would but too-abundantly punish it; & I was more concern'd in his felicitie, than esteeme, the later being an advatage I wholy apropriated to my selfe, which also I could not, but by his extream prejudice. Ah Madam, (the ravisht Artabbanes reply'd) the more you disclose your virtue, the more you manifest my Sin in having doubted it; and you increase the punishment thereof, by endeavouring to extenuate it; Tis upon that score only, that I receive with joy what you now deliver, as I shall doe any thing of that qualitie with the same reception, that contributes to a suffering I cannot more deserve, than I am ambitious to embrace; Yes faire Parthenissa, if I have languisht so long a Life after the evincement of my Cryme, 'twas because I esteem'd Death rather a Reward, than a Punishment of it, and because you commanded me to returne, which the more zealously I obey'd, because in that obedience I evidenc't I would decline no other pennance could be inflicted on me, this transcending all others, as much as my offences does. But now Madam, that I have effected that command, let your next be, to become the Executioner of your Iustice; you will prove your Mercy greater in such an imposition, than in a Pardon, since the first will end a Life, which has lost those hopes which only gave it a relish; and the last by permiting me to see that blessing I have lost, and which I can no more aspire unto, without comiting as high a Sin by my presumption, as by my doubts, will involve me in torments, that but to reflect on, will transcend the actuall operatios of all others. If (said Parthenissa) I am satisfy'd that you believe your selfe so great a Criminall, it proceeds only, that by my passing by your offences, you have the greater obligation to me; I am too-much concern'd in your Life to continue it in Torment, and the Gods have render'd me uncapable of that Injustice, without equally participating in the effects of it; I doe therefore with your Pardon, returne you your hopes, and give you an assurance that Mine cannot have a more pleasing object, than that you will believe you Life is so undissolubly ty'd to mine, that the cares, or negligence you have of your owne, must produce resembling operrtions on, Parthenissa's. Great Gods! (reply'd Artabbanes) you are not so infinite as my Ioy, or the mercy which has created it; neither of those know any limits, & your power does, by being uncapable but by them to make me value, or cherrish my Life; Yes my Princesse (he continu'd, embraceing hir knees, and printing a Thousand burning kisses on hir hand) you have by so obligeing a declaration, invited the happy Artabbanes almost to approve his Sin, in rendring it the efficient cause of so transcendent an evincement of your favour, & made him as much in love with his Life, as with you, or as you are with virtue; and if ever he employes one moment of it but to celebrate your Mercy, may he repeat that Cryme which has so abundantly prov'd the vastnesse of it, or into higher punishments, if the Gods were capable of inflicting on him, any that were so. It was (continu'd Symander) by an infinite Number of such expressions, that these generous Lovers gave each other assurances of their being so, which being finisht, the Princesse (who 'till then had bin so intent upon this admirable Adventure, that she had omited to cast hir Eyes on Sillaces, (who so prodigally had hazarded his Life to revenge and breake hir imprisonment) then did it, and being convinc't 'twas he, by his having lifted up his Helmet, she made him retributions worthy what created them, which fill'd Artabbanes with new admirations, for he thitherto had thought that his Friend, and his Princesse (especially by the former having addrest him to the latter) had seene and converst with one another before; (which by a rare accident they had not,) but during the Combate, my generous Master had receiv'd some wounds, which by the emotions of so passionate a conversation, were so inflam'd, and had so much bledd, that he began to give some symptome of fainting, which cast Parthenissa into one; the care of whose recovery, created Artabbanes's: but as soone as she was restor'd to hir-selfe because of Sillaces wounds as well as my Princes, and that it was late, we resolv'd to goe to Arsacia, which we esteem'd a Place of security against the attempts of Surena's Partizans, should they have any desires of revenge, whilst Sillaces, and Artabbanes wounds facilitated their acting it; I omit (said Symander) purposely, those favours the faire Parthenissa honor'd me withall, which I had no sooner receiv'd and acknowledg'd, than I went to a Countrey-house in sight of the place where all that I have told you happen'd, and there by good Fortune lighted on a young fellow, who by often driving a Waggon, had some little skill in Drivinge a Chariot: with his helpe we got together the Horses, & mended their Traces; but because my Prince's, and his Friends wounds made it dangerous, and painfull to ride, by Parthenissa's re-iterated imitations, they went into hir Chariot, and in that manner came in the close of the Evening to Arsacia, where by the helpe of our young Peasant (who was liberally rewarded) we got into a private House, the Gates being alreadie lockt; and because my wounds were so favourable as to permit me to pay my dutie, to those my condition and inclination owed it, I went, and got a Chyrurgion who liv'd in the Suburbs, from whom I understood that the then Governour of Arsacia, was Zenophon, which was no small satisfaction to Artabbanes, whom he had learnt from Moneses, had ever bin a faithfull servant to all his Family. I must acknowledge my satisfaction at it was not inferior to his, for my Father, and Zenophon, were Cousin-Germanes, and yet had bin more united by Friendship, than by Blood; which obligation never ended but with my Fathers life. But before my Prince would permit his wounds to be drest, he waited on Parthenissa to her Chamber. 'Twas there, by a world of reitterated, and passionate expressions, that he acknowledg'd his Cryme, and the Mercy that had produc'd it, which latter gave him a lesse ill opinion of the former, by finding experimentally there could be something that transcended it, which 'till so obligeing an evincement, had never enter'd into his Faith. Artabbanes and Sillaces were no sooner retir'd, than they went to the woman of the House, who they found had bin blest with an education different to hir present qualitie, and of no common Beautie; they were not a little pleas'd with both, as knowing they render'd hir the fitter for a Service, which she joyfully went to pay the fair Parthenissa. 'Twas after this, that the two Friends made use of the Chyrurgion, who found how great a Enemie their Civilities had prov'd to their healths, and that the paying of their's (unseasonably) two houres would render them uncapable for many, to do the like. Artabbanes was much more troubl'd at this assurance, than at the danger which caus'd it. The Chyrurgion being retir'd, I told the two generous Friends (who lay both in one Chamber) that perhaps it were not amisse, if the next morning I went to Zenophon, and acquainted him with their being in his Government, which obligation of Trust would not only in some good degree recompence his past fidelitie, but invite his future, and thereby procure a powerfull Assistant, in case Surena's being alive, should thrust him into desires of revenge, and of recovery of Parthenissa; or if dead, should infuse resembling ones into his Friends, and Partizans. Artabbanes though he knew exactly the merit of Zenophon's fidelitie, yet he consented asmuch to what I motion'd upon the score that his Princesse would be thereby remov'd to a Place, and Attendance lesse unfit for hir, as upon any other. This resolve being assum'd, they endeavour'd to take their rest, which the joy of Artabbanes, and the sympathy Sillaces had in it, as much hinder'd, as the paine, or inconvenience of their wounds. The day at length appear'd, and I had no sooner inform'd my generous Master, that the Princesse was awake, than he sent me to the woman of the House, to enquire of her Health, who return'd me word from Parthenissa, that he might know hirs by his own. Artabbanes found a misfortune in so much kindnesse, by finding himself in a feaver. This made me hasten to Zenophon, whose power, and care, I fear'd my Prince's sicknesse would need; As soon as I came to his Palace, I desir'd one of his Domesticks to bring me where he was, who being my Guide, I past unexamin'd through his Guards, & came into a large Hall, where I found him inviron'd by a throng of his Officers; and though with Moneses I had left Media in a very green Age, yet I had still some impressions of Zenophon, which the seeing him reviv'd; 'twas with some difficultie I got near-enough to be observ'd by him, which when I perceiv'd I was, I lookt on him so fixtly, that perhaps it made him the more hastily dismisse the greater part of his Officers, who were no sooner gone, than presenting my self to him, I desir'd to know if he were at leasure to hear a Stranger, who had some things of moment to inform him of, and which it was not improbable, but he might be satisfy'd with; I know not whether he read something in my Face, which made him guesse or suspect who I was, or whether the Times which then began to be strangely confus'd, made him believe I came to give him some important advice; but whatever was the Cause, without any ballancing, he commanded me to follow him into a Cabbinet, which was contiguous to the Hall we then were in, whither being come, and the Dore lockt, I askt him, if he had never seen any thing that resembl'd me: After having consider'd me narrowly, he reply'd he had, but that he could not suddenly recollect where it had bin. I thereupon told him my name, which he had scarcely heard, but I found my selfe in his Armes, as a reward of that discovery; and though by many testimonies of joy, he acquainted me with his, yet they were infinitely short of those demonstrations of that Passion, with which he celebrated the newes I told him of my Prince's being so neare him, and in a place under his Power; after I had convinc't his beliefe of that Truth by many protestations, he necessitated me to make him of it, lifting up his Eyes and his hands to Heaven, he cry'd out, Great Gods! you could not create my acknowledgements, in a way I should more willingly pay them, than by granting me the happinesse of serving any of Monese's blood; and if to this blessing you will add that, of permitting me to see his Sonne seated in the Throne of Media, I shall esteeme my selfe abundantly satisfy'd for your having deny'd me one. 'Twas by many resembling expressions that the generous Zenophon evinc't to me his Fidelity to Artabbanes Family was not at all impair'd, neither did his desire to the Gods in my Princes favour relish any thing of an ill subject; since Tygranes, the then King of Media, either by Nature, or choyce, was so averse to the faire Sex, that Artabbanes Passion for one of them, could hardly transcend his aversion for all. Zenophon having put a period to the evincements of his joy, and gratitude, conjur'd me pressingly to conduct him, to him which had rais'd them; This I obey'd, having first desir'd him it might be with privacy for that my Princes condition, if it did not alreadie need circumspection, yet it might; it was therefore by water, that we went to his Lodging, which (as the Governours Palace) stood upon the River Corindas. 'Tis as impossible, as needlesse, to repeate all that past betweene them of Civility; it is sufficient you know, Artabbanes receiv'd him with all the demonstrations of satisfaction, and respect, a person so replenisht with virtue, and Fidelity, could either desire, or hope; and Zenophons joy at the reception was nothing inferior to the greatnesse of what created it. My Prince afterwards inform'd him of the quality of Sillaces, whom he saluted, and complemented, with much humility; those ceremonyes finisht, Artabbanes, who could not but admire at any mans possessing so high a Government as that of Arsacia, who was so declar'd a Partizan of his Fathers, as Zenophon, inform'd him of it. To which Zenophon reply'd, Though you are (Sir) ignorant of this present Government, yet you are not, that the past was so unequall, and Tyrannicall, that your generous Father quitted, not only his interest in it, but in the Kingdome; and not to be an Enemy to Tygranes Quiet, and his owne, voluntarily confin'd himselfe in Parthia. It was long before we knew what created such ungrounded jealousies in our King, and so strange a way of suppressing them in his Vncle; but now the Mystery is as visible as his dissembling that has so long hinder'd it from being so. Merinzor, the first Prince of the Blood (after Moneses) aspir'd by Arte, and Sin, to acquire that preheminence which Nature had deny'd him; and having by admirable insinuations made Tygranes asmuh his Subject by inclination, as he was his, by duty, he so successefully represented to him, the danger of having the next, and certaine Heire (by Tygranes aversion, or disability for Women) to be in the Government, or Kingdome, that at length the King by some usages which neither were consistent with Moneses Quality, or disposition, necessitated your generous Father to an Exilement; This was no sooner effected, on which Merinzors designes were founded, than he appeares publiquely the Favourite of his King, yet so artificially, that many believ'd his codition but from thence bore date; whereas some others, (though indeed but very few) concluded Moneses Banishment was an effect of his having bin so before. Merinzor (as Tygranes has since told me) assur'd him he might now Reigne, by no law but his will, since the discontented had no head to give their Body; & that Moneses by being kept out of Media, would be depriv'd of anticipating his Title to the Crowne of it; but to leave as little to Fortune, as the nature of humane things would admit, he humbly begg'd his Kings permission to allow him in publique to be an earnest Solicitor for your Fathers returne, which (as he said) would insinuate him in all the Designes that would be laid to effect it, and consequently enable him to prevent them. The deluded Tygranes condiscended to this, by which concession, Merinzor, not only cast the odium of Monese's Banishment entirely on the King but also acquir'd to himself those of your Fathers Friends, who had not wit enough to discover, Merinzor was his Enemie; whereby many designes for his restauration became unfruitfull, and by the frequent Execution of the Conspirators, soe weaken'd his Partie, that now there are scarcely enough left to act a designe, though not prevented by Intelligence. My Fortune, or my suspitions kept me out of all those unsuccessefull Plots, and thereby I find my selfe (and some few Friends, who I had acquainted with, and made approve of my jealousies) in a posture able to serve our generous Prince; for not onely this Citie, but Ecbatan, Cyrapolis and Europus are in the power of those, who are resolv'd, they cannot more justly employ theirs, than against Merinzor, and for Moneses, and Artabbanes. But Sir, (continu'd Zenophon) Tygranes being convinc't that your Father being remov'd, all causes of his Fears were so too, abandon'd himself so absolutely to those vices, which unlimited power is aptest to inspire, that partly those exorbitant disorders, but more particularly his assuming to himselfe Moneses Banishment, from whence all our miseries took their originall, has so alienated his Subjects Affections, that Merinzor by obliging all, by permitting Tygranes to oblige none, and by a seemingly soliciting your Fathers return, having gain'd those Hearts he made his King lose, began lately so Much to unvizard his designes, that I discover'd and disclos'd them to Tygranes; but I had much difficultie to free my self from being thought dishonest, for endeavouring to evince Merinzor was so; which I had not effected, had not the Gods (concern'd in the discoverie of so black an ingratitude,) miraculously evidenc't it; For the Court being then at Ecbatan, there came a Packet to Merinzor out of Parthia, but the day before, he was gone to a House of Pleasure not above 200 Furlongs off, where under a pretence of passing away his Time, he employ'd it in gaining of Partizans, and in establishing a fortune for himselfe, which should ruine his Kings. The beliefe I had, that in that Packet there was something of concernment, and the knowledge I had, that it lay not in the Power of inferences, but of demonstrations, to make Tygranes revoke that unlimited Authoritie he had so fatally trusted his Favourite with, made me Determine, to hazard my owne Ruine, to prevent my Kings: I say hazard my owne ruine; For if in that Packet I resolv'd to open, there had bin nothing which might have appologiz'd for my doing it, by my inclinations to your Family, and Merinzors Power, I could not have avoided resenting the most violent effects of it. In brief, I seiz'd upon those letters, and having by the admirable Art of a Secretarie of mine decypher'd them, I found they came from Surena, & discover'd palpably a strong, and dangerous conspiracie, which was partly to be acted by some Parthian Forces, that Prince had promis'd him. I believe Sir, (continu'd Zenophon) you are not ignorant of Surena's person, and Power with Arsaces, which hinders me from giving you a Character of either. Alas (reply'd Artabbanes) I am but too perfectly instructed in the latter, which has cost me so many troubles, that 'tis no small one, to remember them; But I will another time give you their relation, in the mean while, I shall beseech you to continue yours. After (said Zenophon) I had so successefully disclos'd what Tygranes, not I disbeliev'd, immediately I presented him with what he found a misfortune then to know, but had found it a greater, to have longer ignor'd. Never did I see so sudden and so strange an alteration; that in his looks was much inferior to that in his Government, for he perceiv'd, 'twas not now by the Title, but the virtues of a King, that he must continue one; and that Merinzor had but for a time cast away his fears, that afterwards he might eternally cast him out of his Throne. Tygranes in Tears told me this truth and many an other, and by great favours convinc't me his Gratitude for my faithfulnesse, & vigillance, was proportionate to them; I told him 'twas not enough to discover Merinzors infidelity, but he must prevent it; that nothing was more conducive to that end, than without any respite to place men of high fidelity, and no lesse resolution in the principall Townes, which would not only hinder Merinzors possessing them, but deterre his Partizans from a conjunction with him, by so prejudicial, and pregnant an evincement, that his Conspiracy was disclos'd, and partly prevented; that if yet the despaire of Merinzors Faction flung them first into Armes, yet the possession of the Townes, would so protract the time, that before all of them were lost, He might raise an Army, not only to recover them againe, but to punish those that necessitated him to doe it. That one of the best advantages in a Civill War, was to secure the Cities, they being not only Sanctuaries for small Numbers against great, but the Banks, and Magazeens of a Kingdome, and without which the Country cannot subsist; for 'tis those which take off the fruits of the Earth, & returne to the Country those of Industry and Arte; that possessing them, he would gaine the ablest men, which comonly make their residence there, or at least hinder the Enemy from that advantage, which is one of the highest in a Domestick War. I told him many things of this quality which he approv'd, and because by what I had done, he was also confident of my Fidelity, he instantly gave me Commissions to place such Governours in the fower chiefe Cities, for whose Honesty I would answer. In Ecbatan (which you know is the Metropolis of this Kingdome) I plac't Patafernes, Symanders Vncle; Arsacia I elected for my selfe; and for the other Two, Men of whose inclinations I am satisfy'd, and for whose abilities I will more answer for, than my owne. This I did with that celerity which accompanyes those actions, we embrace with duty, and inclination. Ecbatan by reason of the Kings presence, and Guards, we secur'd without delay, or hazard, and thrust out Merinzors Governour, and Creatures, the other Three with some little difficulty we effected; but the first thing of all that we attempted, was the seizing on Merinzors Person, whose intelligence of my taking his Packet, came immediatly to his knowledge, and so he Scap't me; but so narrowly, that had he bin as much hurt, as fear'd, he had not now bin in so promising a condition. I believe (continv'd Zenophon) you may think it strange that in the heate of Tygranes apprehensions, and of his hatred to his late Favourite, I did not embrace soe obligeing a conjuncture for soliciting your Fathers returne; I doe confesse, I was a thousand times upon the point of motioning it, but that which suspended my doeing so, was, least it might ceeate some jealousies of me, and in them, recall the power he had conferr'd on me, which I intended to make use of, to place Partizans of your Family in the most important Governments; which once being effected, would probably render my solicitation lesse unsuccessefull by rendring it more dangerous to deny, than to graunt my request. This reasoning of mine, the event but too evidently evinc't was not groundlesse; for after I had secur'd the chiefe Cities with Governors, declar'd Servants to Moneses, which I palliated to Tygranes, by assureing him I knew none but your Fathers Friends that were Enemies to Merinzor, I implor'd of him by many reasons, and reitterated Prayers to invite Moneses to returne, from whose Courage, & Iudgement, he would doubtlesse derive those good Services, which by Merinzors infidility he needed, and which thereby he had bin so long hinder'd from receiving: I added to this, that had Merinzors infusions of your Fathers designes of aspireing to the Crowne bin as true, as they were false; yet by his losse of Artabbanes (for alas (Sir) we then were confident of that misfortune, by your being so long conceal'd to the world) there was no danger of any attempts, since by the course of Nature, Moneses was much nearer his Grave than he, and by the course of the Median Lawes, the Princesse Lyndadory was excluded from the Crowne. But though Tygranes had cast off his affection for Merinzor, yet he still retain'd those impressions he had planted in him, when he possest it; & consequently either as a Complement to our fidelities upon his owne score, or as an unremovable maxime he had establisht not to admit of your Fathers return, (for if guiltie, he must thereby invest him with too-ample a power to act his designes, and if innocent to act his revenge) he not only possitively deny'd me my request, but enjoyn'd me never to revive it, and in expressions so violent, that instead of making him Moneses friend, I once apprehended he was no Longer Mine. Iudge Sir, (said Zenophon) if to motives of justice, having added that of his interest, and fear, I could not prevaile, how much more certain I had bin of that misfortune, if I had attempted my request upon the score only of the former; I was necessitated notwithstanding so sensible a repulse, to make no publique demonstration of it, yet I was often determining to betray my King into his advantage, by sending for your Father; but the apprehension I then had, that such a proceeding before the effect was evidenc't for which I acted it, might cast Tygranes into an eternall ruine, by occasioning him to cast himself into Merinzors power, hinder'd me from it; which latter was but too probable; for what Merinzor did performe, he was resolv'd Moneses would, had he but the Force, and of two Enemies, 'twas a rational faith, he would elect him whom he had so recently honor'd with his favour, than him, who had never had any share in it. 'Twas upon many as pregnant reasons as these, that I determin'd to expect the leasure of the Gods, for the Restoration of your Family, and in the mean time to act what I could for the ruin of the greatest Enemie of it, which I esteem'd much conducive to that end. In pursuance whereof, the King having honor'd me with the title of his Lieutenant-Generall, reserving to himself the superioritie over all, (as a King that desires and merits victorie, determining to Court her in Person) I came by his Command to this Citie, to raise such forces as voluntarily would fight under the Royal Ensignes; Merinzor too, having alreadie so farre advanc't his preparations, as to have marching out of the Northerne parts of this kingdome, a Bodie of 30000 Men, which dayly increases, and with which he hopes to settle, what my successefull doubts, has so much shaken and indanger'd. Zenophon had no sooner done speaking, than Artabbanes by many fresh Civilities congratulated his Command, and his deserving of it, and by particular expressions made him many signall retributions, for the care he had of Moneses, and his Family. My Prince then let Zenophon know that Surena was in Media, and near Arsacia, how miraculously he had avoided the generous Sillaces sword, and at last that the faire Parthenissa, the Authoress of his sufferings, and desires, was in the same House with him. Zenophon was much amaz'd at the intelligence of Surena's being in Media, but he was much more satisfy'd to learn his Prince's Mistresse was in a place, where he might serve hir, and where he might see a Perfection, which he concluded could not be but transcendent, by making so generous a Captive; he went therefore, with Artabbanes's, and hir permission to the Chamber of that excellent Beautie, which he sawe with admirations, and confessions, that my Prince's desires, and sufferings, could not equall in degrees, that perfection which had occasion'd them. After Zenophon by a silent wonder had complemented hir Beautie, by many pressing, and humble implorings, he invited hir to his Palace, which he said would be lesse unworthy of hir, than the Chamber she was in. Parthenissa acknowledg'd this Civilitie in expressions which acquainted him with hirs, and after the Chyrurgions had assur'd hir, that the Two Princes might, without any danger, be remov'd by Boate to Zenophon's, she condiscended to accompany them thither, where they arriv'd undiscover'd, which my Prince was much intent upon, lest his accidentall coming into Media, might, by the conjuncture of Affaires, relish more of Designe, than Chance, and consequently prejudice Zenophon, who by the Laws of Hospitalitie, and Gratitude, he was confin'd to oblige. As soon as the Princesse was retir'd to hir Appartment, Zenophon presented hir with the faire Emilia, his Daughter, and only Childe, who he begg'd hir to accept, 'till she could recover one that was more capable to serve hir; or if she esteem'd none could be so, then he conjur'd hir to accept of hir for ever. Parthenissa was exceedingly satisfy'd with so obliging a Present, and though Emilia at first sight absolutely gave hir self up to the Princesse, yet she could not more do so to Parthenissa, than I did the like to hir. I cannot Sir, (continu'd Symander) but acknowledge a Truth, which if you sawe the cause of, you would perhaps upon hir accompt excuse this digression, whose Character I would give you, did I not know, that in such attempts, either the Lover thinks he speakes too-little, or is thought to speak too- much. There is no doubt, had not Artavasdes bin too-deeply concern'd in the hearing of his Friends Loves, and in the infelicities of his owne, to act any thing of mirth, or suspention, he had at Symanders cost, given himself no small divertisement; for that faithfull servant, had bin so little one to Love, and so contemn'd the two Princes assurances, that it was a Fate as certaine, as Death, that now this acknowledgement had furnisht his generous Hearer with an ample Theame for Raillery, had not those former considerations silenc't all thoughts of that quality. Symander in expectation of this little war, had continu'd a while silent, but at length, perceiving, & troubl'd at the cause that he mist it, thus prosecuted his narration. Zenophon Leaving Parthenissa in hir Appartment, went to see the Two Princes's in theirs, who, though his Pallace was capacious enough to affoard them distinct ones, had determin'd their Lodgings, as their Friendships, should admit of noe division. The residue of that day, and the Night, was dedicated to Rest; But Artabbanes tooke so little, that the next morning his Princesse being inform'd of it, came to visit him, and perceiving by his indisposition, and the losse of so much blood, that he was very pale she became so too, & what misfortune had created in Artabbanes, Sympathy did in his Mistris, who by the eloquence of hir words aswell as lookes, acquainted him with hir sufferings, which she said, receiv'd no small accession, that his proceeded from the service he had done hir. If (Madam, said my Prince) my present condition ought to produce any operations in you, they should be of a contrary quality to those you ascribe them to, for my Crime upon its own score abundantly merited a higher punishment, than these unconsiderable wounds; I have therefore much more cause to rejoyee than repine, that what I should have suffer'd as an expiatory Pennance for my Sin, I doe, for the duty of serving you, your goodnesse having render'd my punishment needlesse, 'twas just my services should impose on me, what your Mercy declin'd the doeing; and that a part of that blood should be shedd for your safety, which was all preserv'd by your forgivenesse; but Madam, (continu'd Artabbanes) may I not again stand in need of it when I have taken the confidece humbly to beg the knowledge of your Adventures 'till my wounds permit me to acquaint you with mine? This entertainment will be the best Charme against their Paine, for whilst I can heare, & see the faire Parthenissa, my other Sences will resigne their functions to those. If (she reply'd) the relation of my Story can produce so ambition'd an effect, I shall finde in it an ample recompence for all my sufferings; which the sooner to receive I will obey you. silence our feares for you, had rais'd them for himselfe by ingageing in so dangerous,  & unpromising a journey, wherein he evinc't the vastnesse of his Friendship, for there is hardly any of so perfect a quality, as to undertake that upon certainties, which his did but in hopes, I continu'd for a while free from all troubles, but those which both your absences created, and those I sympathiz'd in, of your excellent Sisters, and the faire Zephalinda's; for Surena, nor Arsaces on his score, did not renew their persecution; I admir'd at it, asmuch as I was satisfy'd with it; for though Surena's words assur'd me not of his Passion, yet his languishings did, and in all his visits he so pressingly implor'd my pardon, that I found he was but too-much concern'd in the obtaining it; which having granted to his condition, and not to him, that being alter'd, I had also alter'd my concessio; this I did as a necessary justice, though he gave it a contrary Name; For those prayers which by that proceeding he employ'd for obtaining of my Pardon, he would otherwise (as I apprehended) have imploy'd for obtaining my affection; & the obstacle of his Crime being remov'd, it would have left Arsaces none, whereby he might have continu'd his solicitations for his Favourite. It was above six Moons that I remain'd in this condition, which, though but too full of infelicity by your absences, and Surena's presence, yet it seemes the Gods thought it not full-enough, for by the folly of his Passion, he was finally reduc't to as dangerous a condition, as your Sword had done: 'Twas then that Orodes passing over all considerations, but those of his Favourite, came to visit me and not only implor'd my Pardon, but my Love for him. I represented to him, that one which could stand in need of the former, could hardly merit the latter; that he was a Person whose Treachery render'd him as unfit for his Friendship, as Mine; and that his actions rather call'd upon his Iustice, than protection. Madam (said Orodes) that infidelity you reproach him with, is that which you should esteem him for; the least production of a common Passion, is to endeavour the having it rewarded by sufferings, and by submissions; but one that could not but prove extraordinarie, by the Beauties being so that inspir'd it, you cannot admire at an effect, resembling it's cause; and that your perfections are not common, is not a greater Truth, than that a Cryme in Surena is the like. Your Artabbanes himself I believe durst not have done so much; he loves his Reputation, more than Parthenissa; and who dares doe most for hir, merits most from hir. I know (Sir, I reply'd) that the generous Artabbanes is more a friend to Virtue, than to Love, and I am confident he knows I am so too; 'tis therefore only on that accompt I believe he durst not have done what Surena did; neither is it any glory, that he transcends Artabbanes in nothing but vice; which is a preheminence he will as certainly resigne him, as surpass him in all actions of an opposite qualitie; but (Sir) I hope you cannot seriously expect my affection, for a Person, who pretends no title to it, but by one which renders him unworthy of it. I am (said Orodes) so serious in my request, that to denie it me, will cast me into as bad a condition, as his whose preservation I solicite; my Fate & Surena's being unseparable. But Arsaces finding I was as constant in my resolves, as his Favourite in his fruitless passion, at length converted those prayers for my Affection, into some, for giving him a visit; and that at least I would preserve his life, if I would not render it happie. The Kings importunities forc't that from me which his reasons could not, and taking me with him in his Chariot, he brought me to Surena's Palace; I found the Master of it in a condition, that convinc't me; Pitie is none of the wayes to Love, for had it bin, Surena could have bin no longer deny'd mine. You know (continued Parthenissa) that his good meen yields to none but to Two which are in this Chamber, and yet I found it as remarkable for the change, as it had bin for the perfection. As soon as Arsases had acquainted him I was come to give him a visit, he rais'd himself faintly up, & with a languishing voice told me, I know not Madam, with what designe 'tis you do me this honor; is it either to see the effects of your Power; or to increase them? 'Tis (I reply'd) purely from my Kings Commands, that you derive this visit, and if mine have any influence over you, do not I beseech you, by continuing soe ill, necessitate him to command from me another. Alas Madam (said Surena) why doe you then by your sight give me so great a disinvitation to obey you? who can see your Beautie, and resolve to banish himself eternally from it? your Eyes destroy what your Crueltie makes me elect, and had I not had the felicitie of beholding you now, my sufferings in few dayes had made me obey a Command, which your words has not now more plainly told me, than your usage has; Yes Madam, (he continu'd) since 'tis impossible to decline my Flame, but with my Life, I am taking that fatall, and only way of extinguishing it; and I hope in a short time so to change my condition, that it shall render me as worthy your Pitie, as my ill Fate has render'd me unworthy your esteem. That Death (I reply'd) which you seem to imply, is not to obey, but injure me; and I had rather indure your importunities, than avoyd them at that rate; 'tis your change, not your ruine I desire. Ah Madam (Surena answer'd) the impossibility that any Beautie can transcend yours is not greater, than whilst I live, that I can decline adoring it; & if I vow'd your Eyes could act all things I excepted th' impossibilitie of their queching fires which they themselves inspir'd: that miracle is deny'd them by a power, which renders that deficiencie a greater: so that if you command me to live, you consequently command my Passion to live with me, and you must resolve to suffer the effects of the latter, if you enjoyn the continuance of the former: I tell you (Madam) ingenuously what you must permit, if you permit me to live, that either I may put a period to my Torments, by putting a period to my Life, or not be deluded into fresh Miseries, by fresh Expectations, which will vanish as soon as my sickness does, and add to the Miseries of losing my Cure, that of losing my hopes. So resolute a demaund (continu'd Parthenissa) was so farre from induceing me to say more in his favour, that it made me repent I had said so much, which I had no sooner told him, than Arsaces demonstrated as great a despaire, as what I had said, did ininvolve Surena in; and truely the King by such moving conjurations, & humblings, so farre transported me beyond my resolution, that the conclusion of our visit was, a promise I made Surena of a Pardon for all was Past. But lest this might invite him to actions that might neede it againe, to qualify my forgiveness, I told him he deriv'd it only from Arsaces commands, & his owne condition. He prest me extreamly before I left him, to say he deriv'd it immediatly from me, but that I was so farre from telling him, that it made me profess, if he was not satisfy'd with what I had already spoke, I should rather recall my concession, than any way increase it. Surena (as he said) by this visit, was in few dayes able to pay me one, which he did, and entertain'd me with retributions, not desires. To invite him to a perseverance therein, I us'd him with much more Civility, & Freedome, than either his offence, or my resentment for it had made me formerly practice, Neither was I out of hope, but that recieving favours, when he desir'd none, and none when he desir'd any, his reason might invite him then, to what it should have done before. I must acknowledge I could hardly have bin civill to him, upon any other score, and I had had no small difficulty to perswaded my modesty to listen to such constant expressions of Gratitude with satisfaction, but that I found it less troublesome to heare his thankes than his request; and to have him acknowledge obligations, than desire them; For a Quarter of a Yeare Surena gave me no other troubles, but those of his Visits, But then he began to add to them, those of his accustom'd importunities; I know not whether he believ'd what I had elected to suppress his addresses, was to invite them, or whether those Civilities I did him, to reward his silence, was to solicite the breaking it; but I know, if these were his Thoughts, as soone as he reveal'd, he had no reason any longer to retaine them; for I gave him so resolute a reprehension, that He found I had bin kind, but to keepe him from imploreing my being so; and that he could not elect a more certaine way to be deny'd my affection, than to solicite it; I cannot certainly acquaint you whether this usage, or some internall infirmity which then began to manifest it self, was the cause of his Sickness, but I can, that suddenly after, he fell into a very dangerous one, & though it were equally so to his former, & that Arsaces did me the honor constantly to visit me, yet he never desir'd I should doe so to Surena; But the satisfaction I receiv'd thereat, I soone observ'd, was too-dearly purchas'd; For in some Fower or Five successive visits, I observ'd Orodes had soe incessantly his Eyes fixt on mine, & utter'd such disorder'd, and disjonted discourses, that I began to doubt, what his next seeing me made me but to-certaine of: for after all the Court which waited on him, were retir'd into a Gallery contiguous to my Chamber; Arsaces spoake these words, with asmuch Trouble as I heard them. Madam Though you should infinitly admire, that I doe not now solicite you for my dying Friend, yet I doe as much, that I have done it so long, & that I should employ those prayers for another, which your Beautie makes me stand in need of for my selfe: I beleive faire Parthenissa (he continu'd) you cannot so much admire at my making now this declaration, as that I did it not sooner, and the greatest wonder next your Beautie, is, that I have so long declin'd adoreing it: whilst my Love was kindling, my Friendship transcended it, but now it burnes, it has consum'd my Friendship, & I feare will consume me, unless you afford me as much Love, as you inspire. This assurance cannot be more confident, than true, and I esteem'd I had no higher motive to induce you to save your King, than to acqaint you that you have the power to doe it. I believe (said Parthenissa, to hir generous Auditors) by your own surprize, it will not be very difficult to perswad you of Mine, but as soone as the first disorders of it were a little mitigated, I turn'd my Eyes towards the King, and found, those I had so lately supprest could not transcend those which were visible in him; & though this gave me too-palpable an assurance of a Truth, which none could have bin more ambitious to have discover'd, than I was troubl'd to have done it, yet I told him: This discourse (Sir) which you have made me of your Love, is doubtless to revenge my not conferring mine, on Surena, and I consider this Raillery with Ioy, as my belief, that 'tis the only penace you will impose, on the necessity of my disobedience. I rather hope (Arsaces reply'd) that your esteeming that a Raillerie, which I now tell you in so much earnest, is the only penance you will prescribe me, for not having told you of it sooner: or if you esteem me so unworthy the honor of your Conversation, as in it to speake any thing unserious, your Beautie might more justly have made you assume that thought, when I did implore your bestowing it on another, than when I doe, your conferring it on me: But Madam, if you believe it as great an injurie to your modestie to acknowledge your conquest, as I know 'tis to your Eyes to decline it, yet your reason cannot be but convinc't of your victorie, when I assure you I have seen Surena languish with as little reluctancie, as you have done it; when even his silence pleaded for him, as much as his condition: for I suspected he kept it, out of a knowledge that I was become his Ryvall, which he has discover'd either from my not persevering his Intercessor, or my sighes, which are now more inflam'd than those of grief used to be, has told him, what I had not the confidence to doe. This proceeding faire Parthenissa, affoards you no lowe, nor perhaps unpleasing Character of my Passion, for at the same instant that I but implore your affection, I act your revenge, which gives me a hope that what obliges you, cannot be detested by you. These words he animated with so passionate a tone, and action, that even those did also speak: but as I was about to doe so, I was reliev'd by the faire Zephalinda, in whose presence Arsaces entertain'd me a while in words of a contrary quality, either that he would conceal his Passion from all, or particularly from Surena's sister; and though the King continu'd a while in my Chamber, yet by the disorders and disjoyntedness of his discourse, I found how much he was troubl'd, that Zephalinda had interrupted him. But he could not be more offended thereat, than I was satisfy'd; for thereby I procur'd some time towards the forming my answers, and the course I was to follow in this new emergencie; for I was hopefull to improve his passion to a better end, than that for which he had assum'd it; and make it the means of bringing Artabbanes to Parthenissa, which was design'd to deprive him of hir. As-soon as Orodes was retir'd, Zephalinda told me, At last Madam, I believe I shall make my visits prove what hitherto I fear they did not, a satisfaction to you, proportionate to that I receive in paying you them; for but even now I have had the effect of my incessant solicitations; Surena has given that to my Prayers, which he should long since have done to Reason, and Virtue: Yes (Madam) he has protested to me by what he ador'd, as much as now he does but admire, that if he has any Passion for you, it is only to serve you, and that he will employ as much care, and Art, for your union with Artabbanes, as he has done to hinder it; and I am come to implore you from him, to give him a visit, that he may give you those demonstrations of his conversion, which may induce you as much to believe the realitie of it, as alreadie I do. I know not (said Parthenissa, prosecuting hir discourse) whether it be the nature of all my sex, to fear the Truth of what they most desire, but I am certain 'tis mine, and consequently I had many pregnant jealousies, that Surena but seemingly yeelded that to his King, which he really preserv'd for me; and that what he now did, was an action of Policie, and nor Conversion: I was often about to tell Zephalinda my douts, but lest they might be an offenc (which mine owne defects, and Arsaces letting me know Surena did not know his Passion, made me the apter to fancie) I did at last, (more convinc't by Zephalinda's Prayers, than Reasons) condiscend to visit hir Brother, into whose Chamber I was no sooner come (for yet his indisposition made him keep it) then staying his Sister, and sending all the rest out of it, he told me, with a confidece which I believ'd nothing but Truth could put on, at least that a Lover could not, speaking to his Mistris. That I have had a passion Madam for you is not so strange, as that I now divest my self of it, and those hopes which despaire should have made me lay downe, I doe now, by way of reparation for their having bin so offensive, & dangerous; I am also so sensible of having interrupted a Passion, which I now as much esteeme, as I have envy'd, that I finde as transcendent a satisfaction in having mist my desires, as I should in having obtain'd them; Those Prayers therefore which I hitherto employ'd for your affection, I doo now Madam for your Pardon, which is now as necessarie to my Life, as that was to my felicity; which you may establish without being obnoxious to your owne; formerly you were to be vicious to make me happy, now you are but to be virtuous to doe it; your incostacy then could only be my cure, but 'tis your Mercy now that only can be so, which to obtaine, I protest by all the Gods, & by those which are more particularly concern'd in the punishmet of perjury, I will never have any desires for you, but to see you by an Hymeneall union in his embraces, who now, & never but 'till now, I esteem'd the least unworthy of you. What need I tell you more (said Parthenissa) than that Surena by such expressions, and vowes, gave a begining to that Faith, which in progress of time he so well improv'd, and settl'd, that his change was as absolutely my belief, as desire. But what the Favourite declin'd, the King assum'd, & I read the greatness of his Love, by the conquest it had obtain'd over his Friendship; he gave me besides some signall evincements of it every day, though I was not a little diligent to retrench all opportunities, that by my actions, I might acquaint him with my intentions, which I esteem'd the civill'st, and certain'st way of denyall. I must acknowledge I was both satisfy'd, and troubl'd at a Passion so replenisht with respect, as that of Orodes was, for though on the one side, it secur'd me from those violences, his power, and flame might inspire him with; yet on the other, it hinder'd me from suppressing his hopes, and importunities. Surena being recover'd of the indisposition both of his Body, and Minde, gave me as many visits under the notion of a Friend, as he had done under that of a Lover, and as a fresh evincement he was no more the latter, he told me one day, Certainly Madam the Gods are not a little concern'd in the having me lay downe my Passion, by ordaining two things for the reward of that performance, which I most ambition'd, that of oblieging you, and Orodes; who has this morning disclos'd to me a Flame, I should have wonder'd at, had he not told me, 'twas you that inspir'd it: By the experimentall knowledge I have had of your Beautie, I was not so much surpriz'd at that declaration, as when after he had made it, that he could conjure me to pardon his being my Rivall, and that I would no longer continue his: I esteem'd it strange, that he which resented the influence of your Eyes, could thinke me capable of not doing the like, and that I should decline the power of a God, to obey that of a King; I told him this but to indeare an obligation I had prophetically conferr'd on him; but after I had cast him into Troubles, great enough to let him know those my obedience would involve me in, I assur'd him of it. Truly Madam, he contracted a joy so great at the promise I would lay downe my passion, that I believe nothing can transcend it, but an assurance that you will accept, and reward his. I did this readily, that he might conclude 'twas with willingness, that thereby convincing him I was no longer his Ryvall, I might become his Confidet, & pay you those duties, which one more concern'd in his Interests, than yours, would never doe; I had also this farther hope, that since out of a respect to him, I could divest my self of my Flame, it might upon the generous Artabbanes's return, take from Arsaces all excuses of continuing his, since it manifested there was actually a Power in your Adorers, to decline that Title; which without this President, he might have alleadg'd was an impossibilitie. I knew not (continu'd Parthenissa) whether I had cause to resent this as an obligation, for though as Surena stated it, there might be some possibilitie of its success, yet that was so small, as it left it disputable whether there were any, or no; for examples of virtue, are more often commended, than practic'd by those, who promise themselves a higher satisfaction in declining their imitation; especially too, when the quality of the Person, preserves him from suffering, but in Mens opinions; whereas if Surena had still pretended an Affection for me, it might have deny'd Arsaces a liberty, which this Concession absolutely afforded him; & thereby, by having two Lovers, have bin preserved from having one; I let Surena know this was my opinion, but he was so wedded to his, that he assur'd me, were he to act his part again, and had only heard those reasons, and not that they were Mine, he had follow'd his own, which nothing could induce him to believe, were the worst, but my thinking then so. At length Arsaces, convinc't that Surena was not his Ryvall, made him really his Confident, who so artificially acted his Part, that he satisfy'd us both; and to make his King the less solicit me, he gave him still better answers from me, than ever were given him by me: I yeelded to this Proceeding by Surena's advice, who pretending the greatest knowledge in Orodes's humour, made me esteeme him the fittest to mannage it: But whilst the Court of Parthia was in this Condition, the Kingdome was engag'd in a bloodie Warr; For the Tabienians knowing their Crymes merited no Mercy, neither expected, nor implor'd the Kings; your unfortunate difference with Surena, having render'd you uncapable to command the Army, and the generous Sillaces having declin'd that honor, to restore us your Company, it was conferr'd on Ariobarzanes, who you know is a Prince merits that Title, and wanted success in nothing, but in what you had too-much; I cannot tell whether his desire to serve his King, or his hopes to become more fortunate in the faire Zephalinda by the Oratories of Honor, than he had bin thitherto by those of Love, made him accept that Command; but I can, that he did; & though by the situation of the Countrey, and the despaire of those that inhabited it, the Warre was protracted; yet Ariobarzanes had that consolation, that he never lost an opportunitie to fight, and never did fight, but he was victorious; In the end his Courage, and Conduct made him entirely so over the Tabienians; but at his return from that victorie, he found thereby he had nothing facilitated another, which he a Thousand times more ambition'd; for Zephalinda was as uncapable of having a Passion for any, as all that saw hir, were, of declining one for hir. This internall warre concluded; by the advance of Pompey an exterior one began; Orodes, and the Prince Pacorus with a vast Army marcht to the confines of Armenia, & the Prince Phraates with another into Syria, to infest the Roman Colonies, hoping that by making two Warres abroad, they should hinder any to be made at home. I purposely omit telling you what Complements Arsaces made me at his departure, & how he protested, if he ambition'd Lawrels, 'twas only to lay them at my feet. But by the as-strange, as sudden Peace Pompey made with the Armenians, he found himself necessitated to advance with a part of his Army into Syria to fortifie that of Phraates, which abundantly needed it, by the Roman Generall's being more concern'd to relieve his Friends, than to make any new acqusitions. Pompey by this re-inforcement of his Enemies, or call'd home by the dawning confusions in Italy, settl'd his Affairs by Treaty with Orodes, and so returned to Rome, and the King to Nineveh, where he was receiv'd in Triumph, his Flatterers alleadging he had obtain'd a victorie, by not losing one to the Romans; Pacorus had not so much as this pretence to a tryumphant reception, for he was entirely defeated by the generous Artavasdes, who us'd his success so handsomly, that his very Enemies did hardly envie, or deplore it. Surena who amongst many others enjoy'd the benefit of his Civilitie, assur'd me it had produc't the effect, I mention'd. The winter of this year, the Court constantly resided at Nineveh, & Arsaces as constantly persecuted me, though I must acknowledge I avoyded many importunate Dayes, by Surena's Art, and Friendship. About this time there happen'd an Accident, which though for a while it exempted me from Arsaces Addresses, yet soon after it afforded him a Libertie to continue them with more assiduitie, and hope: 'Twas the Death of his Queen, who having bin in some danger whilst she was in labor of Phraates, had solemnly protested, if Iuno Lucinia (who you know we acknowledge Guardian of the Geniall Bed) would free hir from it, she would wholly sequester hir self from the World, and dedicate hir the residue of hir Life. This the Goddess granted, and this the Queen perform'd; and though the accomplishment of this vow was esteem'd a great misfortune, yet it was a greater, that she had not made it after the generous Pacorus Birth. The solemnitie of the funerall being celebrated for one Queen, Orodes attempted to make another, by offering me that Title, in such earnest & pressing words, that I was asmuch troubl'd to finde they were reall, as another would have bin, to have doubted it. Whilst the Queene was living, I had some pretence to decline his Addresses, and to render that an impossibily from his condition, which really was one from mine; Though he often told me; That his Queene by having voluntarily banisht hirself from his Bedd, had given him provocation enough to make another assume hir place; That though it were a custome amongst the Kings of Parthia to have but one wife, yet it was not a lawe; which though it had bin, yet the cause of his infringing it, would sufficiently appologize for it, and that my Beauty would render the preserving that practice, a stranger thing, than the violating of it. To this I answer'd, That it was a pregnant evincement Bygamy was extreame odious, since custome without law, had so long hinder'd our Kings from it; That there was a sufficient determent in the very act, since no penalty was impos'd on the comitting it; That I should recieve more horror from being the cause of violating so sacred, and ancient a Practice, than advantage by the honor I might thereby derive; & that, that custome of our Kings having but one wife, was so ingrafted in the Hearts of all the Parthians, that I should not only be consider'd by them, but by my selfe, as his Concubine, rather than his Queene; 'Twas with many resembling reasons and as many pressing conjurations that during the Life of the Queene, I preserv'd my selfe from that Title; But now the Gods having remov'd that pretence, they left me without any, especially since I had alwayes represented hir, as the greatest, & indeed as the only obstacle; which I had done, not only by Surena's Councell, but by that of my Reason; for I found none so civily unanswerable, nor so long like to continue so, as that. Orodes when he made me the offer of a Crowne, told me with it, that doubtless the just Gods who knew the vastness and cleerness of his Flame, had purposely remov'd all obstructions that might hinder my rewarding it. This unexpected accident, and his so resolute, and pressing demands, cast me into great perplexities, which I may justly terme so, though they were created not from what I was to resolve, but what to answer. At length, least he might esteem my silence a Concession, I told him; By giving me (Sir) too great an opinion of your Passion, you may create in me a proportionate fear to recieve it; For if as soone as your Queene is in hir Grave, you take another into hir Bedd, you will demonstrate how little esteeme you make of a Wife, and consequently make me apprehend being yours; besides (Sir) so precipitate a proceeding, may induce the World to believe 'twas not the Gods, but the King that remov'd his obstructions; I shall therefore (Sir) conjure you, as you esteeme my satisfaction, or your Kingdomes, protract your desires, 'till I may without prejudice recieve them. Arsaces told me I might rather create inferences of the greatness of his Flame, than Feares of its reallity, by his passing over all considerations which came in competition with it; but since I did not decline, but suspend the recompence of it, he would to satisfy my nice scruples, indure some dayes of Tormet, for so (he said) he must terme all those, which he was to spend in the condition he then was in. He withdrew himself not long after, and gave me leasure to reflect on the cruelty of my condition, for if on the one side I resolutly acknowledg'd my affection, & unalterable resolution for Artabbanes, I should thereby not only eternally confirme his Banishment, & consequently not only deprive my self of Him, but also of that deliverance, which I soly & absolutly expected from him, and so exasperate Orodes, that it would inevitably (as Surena protested to me, who was perfectly verst in his Nature) make him run to those extreames, which he could not thinke on without Horror; and to prevent which, I had treated him with so little cause of disgust; and on the other side, if I disclos'd not my affection for you, I left my self by the Queenes unfortunate Death, not many dayes of disguisement, which would no sooner be effluxt, than I must absolutely fall into one of those extreames, I so justly apprehended, and thitherto I had so artificially, and painfully avoyded. These sad reflexions, though they were much extenuated by the constant visits, and consolations of Lyndadory, and Zephalinda, yet at length they had so efficatious an operation on me, that by degrees they cast me into an indisposition, which increast as the allotted time for the Kings mourning expir'd. The Gods shall be my witness I implor'd them with constant Teares, and Prayers, to send me some such Sickness, as might ruine this little, and unfortunate Beautie, which was so likely else to ruine me: I did this (generous Artabbanes) out of a true character I had contracted of your virtue, which I concluded could not despise one that wanted Beauty, but by having lost it for you, and who apprehended not the losing your affection, in giving you an evincement as great, as unfortunate, of hir own. Artabbanes by an action altogether humble, and acknowledging interrupted his Princess to make his words doe the like, which to the best of my remembrance were these, Though there are not any things I so passionatly ambition as the transcendent felicity of receiving testimonyes of my Princesses esteeme, and of satisfiing hir, I adore the Beauty of hir Minde, at least as much as that of hir Face; yet I had much rather be resolv'd of the former, & convince hir of the latter, by assurances & by vowes, than by so fatall a manifestation; neither would the Gods give so undeniable a proofe of their want of omnipotency, as to destroy a perfection they cannot restore or repeate; 'twas better a thousand times the criminall Artabbanes should lose his hopes, than the world so unimitable a Beauty; and Arsaces could not be so unjust in having so persecuting a Passion for it, as you Madam, in wishing it so deare and criminall a cure. I did not only (said the fair Parthenissa) wish it that cure, but rather than he should want it, I would have conferr'd it on him by my Death; and 'twas but fit I should act that for the preservation of my affection, which only can put a period to it. My Prince would have made hir some proportionate retributions to what had made him esteeme it necessarie, had he not esteem'd it more so, to obey his Princesse, who impos'd on him the keeping of silence, and as a further confinement to it she thus continu'd hir discourse. Whilst I was languishng away a Time which yet I thought much more too-short, than Arsaces the contrary, the generous Pacorus never left soliciting his Father, 'till he had procur'd a second Army to repaire the disgrace of having lost the first; which he had no sooner obtain'd, than he did too a Victory against the Armenians, which had wanted nothing of meriting that Name, had it bin wonne against the same Generall, to whom Pacorus had lost one; but perhaps had he bin present, who should have perfected his success, it might have hinder'd it. Artavasdes thought he deriv'd this Civility from Symander, 'till he had protested he did that Truth from Parthenissa, whose words, and Story the Faithfull Servant thus prosecuted. My indisposition (the Princess continu'd) proceeding absolutely from that of the Minde, had a languishing, and slow operation on the Body, which the Physitians said nothing but time could render dangerous. Arsaces having assum'd this belief, the less inconveniently to pass away the remainder of the Morning Year, or to usurp the Glory of his Sons success, or (as he protested to me) to avoy'd seeing my indisposition, which his sympathy would make him assume, with an Army rais'd in haste, he march'd so, to the siege of Tygranocerta, which Pacorus the next day after his Victory had besieg'd. Artabbanes to exempt the fair Parthenissa from an unnecessarie trouble, acquainted hir, how he had from the generous Ventidius, reciev'd at large the relation of all those transactions in Armenia, which he promis'd that Night to Communicate to Sillaces. I have then (said the fair Parthenissa) but to informe you, that Arsaces came to Niniveh before Pacorus & Altezeera, which though he alleadg'd was but to render hir reception the more considerable, was indeed to summon me of my inferr'd engagement, the last day of his mourning, being that of his returne. The continuance of my indisposition gave me an accepted excuse, which I would have constantly purchas'd at the same rate. Neither did I despaire of both, and that which gave me those hopes was, the having lost all Mine of your returnes; for now 'twas above two Years, since we had remain'd in a perfect ignorance of your Fortunes; which made me apprehende Orodes affection for me, and his knowledge of mine for you, had made him destroy what I wanted but the certainty of, to doe the like unto my self; But Surena by passionate Oaths of Arsaces innocence, remov'd my jealousies of him; but nothing could my feares for you, which I hoped would have so impair'd my small Beautie, that by my loss of it, you had not suffer'd the loss of me; But not long after I found the flattery of those imaginations, which Arsaces by a visit entirely banisht, for after he had commanded (having first obtain'd my permission) all the Company to retire, he told me; That indisposition (Madam) which I did hitherto consider as my punishment alone, I now doe as yours also, for the just Gods have impos'd it on you, to revenge your not rewarding a Flame as bright, and pure, as those Eyes, and that virtue which created it. The yeare of mourning my fair Princess is now expir'd; Your so long declining to be my Queene, made my Minde weare that Livery, as much as my Body did, for the loss of my other: let not your coldness make me any longer carry it; neither Madam can you doe it, without publishing you have not delay'd, but refus'd to reward my Passion, for since to deny me my cure, you decline your own, that belief will be with more reason assum'd, than it can be Rejected. Sir (I reply'd) you might rather inferre from the strange continuance of my indisposition, that the Gods are not a little ingag'd to prevent an union so unworthy the great Arsaces, and consequently so apprehended by me: therefore (Sir) you cannot consider that as my punishment, which is both the Gods and my desire; but could my receiving your affection be as efficatious as you alleadge, judge then I beseech you thereby, how much I am concern'd in not comitting that fault, since to prevent it, I decline not only my owne cure, but my Kings. You may my fair Princess (said Arsaces) rather conclude, that your indisposition if not sent you as a punishment from the Gods, is at least sent you as an evincement my Flame is confin'd to you, more than to your Beauty; and that they are not a little concern'd in the manifestation of this truth, since they elect so deare a way to evince it, and rather then not prove the greatness of the one, impaire the greatness of the other, If Madam I had the power to obey your Commands of a longer expectancy, I should not implore their revocation; for the highest honor next to obeying, is receiving them; doe not therefore fair Parthenissa expect a testimony of my respect, from what will give you an ill one of my Flame, and believe it Madam, that must be an impossibility, which your Comands, & satisfaction, cannot make me obey. He entertain'd me with many professions, and requests of this Nature, before he left me; And a little after Surena came to visit me, but with a Countenance as full of sadness, as my Heart, which he brought no small accession to, by assuring me he fear'd our Griefs, had the same source; Alas I found his apprehensions were but too-justly grounded, when he further assur'd me, that at his meeting Arsaces as he came out of my Chaber, he had told him, that he now found what he had consider'd as a delay, was a refusall, but that he was determind' to make all those that meant to delude him, finde in the end, that they did delude themselves. He said this too (continu'd Surena) in one of those Tones which he uses when he is unchangeably in earnest, which makes me conclude he will shortly make use of Power, to obtaine what he cannot by intreaty. Alas Surena (I reply'd) is there no way but Death, to avoyd a Tyrany I more justly detest? Truly Madam he answer'd, I am confident there is no way of prevention left by Flight; For under the Title of his future Queene, he has already given you a Guard, which is not so much to defend as to detayne you; & could we deceive their intelligence, or corrupt their Faith, what retreate could you propound; for all the Kings of Asia would feare the receiving a Beautie, which unavoydably will carry a Warre after it, as great as it self, and by making a while their Kingdomes a Sanctuary for you, render them in a short time none for themselves; for Arsaces will employ all the forces of his Empire, to reposses what he values more than it, which will hinder any Prince from so dangerous a Charity. I must then (I reply'd) be my own Sanctuary, and the first insolence Arsaces offers me, shall be the last, for whe he looses the respect due unto my Sexe, I will loose that due unto his Quality, and let him know I liv'd only for Artabbanes, which when I may no longer doe in this world, I will goe & expect him in an other, where all Power is employ'd to preserve, not persecute a generous Passion. But Madam, (said Surena) should the Gods call unto them the blessed Artabbanes who is the cause of this Constancy, would not the effect then cease? and might not Orodes expect your Affection, when you could no longer conferre it on his Ryvall? If said I (much offended at so strange a question) the Gods call Artabbanes to a fitter residence for him, I shall esteeme it so for me, & soone after give him my Company, either by the helpe of my Griefe, or Resolution. I had scarce ended these words, when I found Surena at my Feet, where in expressions as humble, and moveing, as his posture, he implor'd a fresh pardon for having persecuted, & injur'd a Flame so pure, that it shew'd him he had acted a Sinne, in only adoring the possessor of it; which to repaire, he would leave no meanes unessay'd; and if all others fail'd he would involve the Parthian Empire in as great troubles, as the King of it could involve me. This proceeding made me change those words into retributions, which I intended to have imploy'd in reproaches, which his seeming solicitation for the King, made me esteem him worthy of. Surena was as much satisfy'd with my Gratitude, as I was with the cause of it, and to misimploy no time, he went immediatly to Arsaces to search further into his resolutions. All that Day & the next, I heard nothing either from him or the King, the last consol'd me for the first, but the Night of the Third, Surena came into my Chamber somewhat late, and told me, that the cause why he had not so long visited me, and why he then did it at so unseasonable an houre, was to doe me service, & to bring me the Newes he had done it. For (said he) at length Madam I have perswaded Orodes, that your coldnesse proceeds from your indispositio, of which you might be soone recover'd, did you but change the Ayre; That the Castle of Eden (which stands in the Island that beares the same Name) is a place whose strength, and scituation, was as fit for your cure, as safety, and that if with your Sickness, you did not cast off your disdaine, there would be then no excuse left you, and a sufficient one given him to act his desires by those wayes, he should imagine soonest feasible & conducive to them: I was Madam (continu'd Surena) necessitated to give him hopes of success, to hinder him from acting it, and 'twas thereby that I have procur'd your license to goe into this Castle, where I shall have more oppertunities to act your securitie, than I can have here; for the Garrison (as the Castle) is mine, & if Orodes should cotinue his Passion, I hope so to order your affaires, that you shall never be the Sacrifice of it. I made Surena many retributios proportionate to the obligations. The next day I had the honor to Receive a visit from the Princess Altezeera, who, was newly come to Nineveh, in whose Person & Conversatio I found almost Charmes enough to suppress that dissatisfaction, I had contracted for hir inconstancy to the generous Artavasdes, who I knew could not but Deserve hir Love, because he did possess Artabbanes's Friendship. I was disinabled from making hir my Retributios at hir own Appartment, or making a greater acquaintance with hir, which my first seeing hir gave me a passionate desire of; for the King intent upon every thing which might probably contribute to my health, the succeeding morning gave me a visit, & conjur'd me as he condescended to every thing for my satisfaction, so by a resembling returne, I could reward his care, & passion. I was exempted from giving him any reply, by the arrivall of Lyndadory, & Zephalinda, to whom I had given advice of my sudden remove, and whose companyes in my retreat I had desir'd, and obtain'd; Arsaces observing by their presence, he could neither continue his discourses nor expect any returnes to them, led me to a Gally, which was provided for us, and then as a Civilitie accompany'd us to the Castle of Eden, only (as he said) to see if there wanted any thing for our reception. Wee had not many Furlongs thither, yet our ascending the Current (because the violence of it) took up the whole Day, so that Arsaces continu'd there all the Night, which (as Surena told me) he spent in giving the Captain of my Guard (that follow'd me) instructions to prevent my escape, should I have any such designe, and promising to his Care, recopenses such as nothing should transcend but his punishments, should he neglect it. The day following, Artabbanes (taking away Surena's Garrison, alleadging it unfit they should be where his Guards were) after some assurances of his Passion, and desires to receive, and reward it, return'd to Nineveh, which perhaps he did the sooner, from a belief, that his absence would be as contributarie to my health, as any other prescription. The Isle of Eden is a place so replenisht with all the Beauties of Art, and Nature, that doubtless the Iews, (a Nation not very remote) have some reason to justifie it, the scituation of the Earthly Paradice, for I believe 'tis as difficult to finde in it a defect, as to wish it an addition. For some Moons, in this pleasing residence, we past a Life that had no Cloudes, but what our feares, and sufferings for the absence of you two created, but to these not long after we added that of Orodes Company, who one day told me, he could no longer deprive himself of Mine, & that I must prepare next morning to return to Nineveh, to assume a Title I had but too long declin'd. Though I made many pressing implorings to suspend a little longer my return to a place which had so much indanger'd my health, and my leaving one, had so much restor'd it; yet he was as deaf to my Prayers, as I had bin to his, for immediately he gave order for my removeall next Day, and the same went to Nineveh, (as he said) to make my reception the less unworthy of me. Surena begg'd his permission to remain in Eden that Night, to do the last honors of his House, and to wait on me in my return; but Arsaces, either from wilfullness, or suspition would not permit it. They were no sooner gone, than Zephalinda, and Lindadory came to my Appartment to consult on so great an extremitie, which was the more so, by Surena's necessitated, and unexpected remove; on whose advise, and promises, I had establisht my greatest confidence; but alas, we found in our consultations rather subjects, of despair, than relief; for the more we reflected on my danger, the higher we alwayes found it. At length I told them, that what confin'd me from hopes of escaping, taught me what to elect, & though the cruel Gods hinder'd my being Artabbanes's, yet they had not the power to hinder me, from not being any others. This I spoake with a Countenance which did speak my resolutions, and this immediately drew some teares into the Princesses Eyes, which more troubl'd me, than to have acted the designe that caus'd them, whilst I was giving consolations, where it may be another had needed them, there came a Stranger hastily into the Roome, who we no longer thought one, than whilst he kept his disguise, for as soon as he had cast it off, we knew him to be Surena, who in a disorder'd haste told me; Madam, the concerne I have in your Interests, makes me decline my owne, for only to offer you my service in keeping you from your Enemie, I have made the King irreconciliably mine; for I have not only violated his Commands by leaving Nineveh, but am resolv'd to repeat my disobedience, if the honor of yours enjoyne it me; In a word Madam, Arsaces told me he can no longer decline a blessing he has asmuch power, as will to invest himself in, and since to evince the greatness of his respect, he has so long delay'd it, to evince the greatness of his Passion, he will no longer do it; that the next day after you return, he will make you his Queene, or if your coldness doe decline so satisfying his desires, you will thereby invite him to the same end, though by a much differing way. These Madam (continu'd Surena) were his very words; which he accompany'd with so many and horrid oathes, that he has render'd it a less cryme to act his sin, than to decline it. I am therefore come to offer you a Life for the preservation of your Loves, which has been too much employ'd to distract, and ruine them; I present it you asmuch to repair my cryme, as to hinder my King from acting his, which nothing but some sudden, and brisk resolution can prevent; were we but out of this Island, I durst promise you a retreat in a Kingdome, where I hope you may one day Reigne; For Merinzor, the most considerable Person in Media, now Moneses and Artabbanes are out of it, is so much my friend, and so much more one to virtue, that were we but there, Arsaces must take that great Empire, before he take you; This I dare engage my selfe for, though I have practic'd the obtaining Merinzors affection, but only since I apprehended the violence of my Kings, would render it usefull, and necessary to you. We had (said Parthenissa) after Surena's assurance of a Sanctuary, a thousand propositions how to recover it, and that which gave me the greatest approbation for that which he propounded, was, that Media could not but have many servants to Artabbanes, who by the Lawes of it, and Nature, was one day to weare that Crowne; Zephalinda advis'd, that by some device or other, Orodes might be againe drawn to visit us, and then that Surena should seize upon him, and make his liberty, the ransome of Mine, and hir Brothers; with whom, and with hir, I might retire into Media; Lyndadory approv'd this advice so she might be of the Company, which she alleadg'd might perhaps bring some security to it, by hir being Daughter to a Prince, whose memory there, was in as great, as just veneration; she added too, that by my taking some Physick whose operation should be visible when Orodes came to visit me, I might not only confirme him my remove was dangerous, but purchase time enough for Surena to draw in force enough to secure us from the Kings; We had doubtless elected this designe, had not Surena said, that 'twas a thing impossible to delude a jealous Lover; that the effects of an indisposition manifested in that conjuncture of time, would appeare rather a Sickness assum'd, than befallen me; That to take the King Prisoner would raise him an Army, which might make me his, since many would fight for his liberty, which would not for his obtayning forceably his Mistris; and if I counterfeited an indisposition, Arsaces Love, or Iealousie, would keepe him perpetually near me, and so render my Flight as impossible as desir'd; but (said Surena) if all these Reasons, were disputable, yet this is not; That by violating my Kings Command in coming hither, I have so exasperated him, that he will never trust himselfe in a Place, where I have both the Power and Provocation to repeat my Disobedience. Therefore he concluded there was no other way but immediatly while the Night contributed to their assistance, under a pretence of giving the Guard their farewell-entertainment to give as many of them Wine, as had not reason enough to refuse it; then to fall upon those who were able to resist, and by their Deaths, force a passage to our Freedomes, which having obtain'd, to make Media the seat of it. There was nothing (said Parthenissa) I scrupl'd at in this, but the destroying those Persons, whose Fidelity to their King, was their only Cryme; but the necessity of my condition, made me at last condiscend to what (next being false to Artabbanes) I most apprehended; only I passionatly conjur'd Surena to spill no more bloud, than was of necessity to be shed for our deliverance. To be brief, Surena without his disguize, went to the Captain of my Guards, to whom (he said) Arsaces had expresly sent him from Nineveh, the next morning to waite on me thither, which the other easily credited, knowing his Kings Passion for me, & his Friendship for Surena; who entertain'd the deluded Officer, 'till some of his Servants had made all those of the Guard drunke, that had a minde to be so, About Midnight whe all was buried in sleepe, & silence, but those which knew the Designe, and those which had the Guard, Surena with all his Domesticks fell upon them, and though his Numbers exceeded theirs yet their, Captain, who knew how certaine a Death his defeate would be from his Enemyes, or his King, so briskly disputed his Fate, that Surena began to doubt his owne, which to decide, he resolutely Charg'd the Captain, who he found was the Soule of his Party, and whom, after a long and bloudy dispute, he left dead upon the place; all the Souldiers Courages fell with their Officers, so that Surena remembring my pressing desires, sav'd their Lives; Surena cover'd with Bloud, and victory, came to my Chamber, and begg'd me so to employ the latter, that before Orodes could know his action, we might be where he could not revenge it. I told him, this was a request fitter for me than him, & that I left the ordering of my liberty, to the Bestower of it; he desir'd me then by the dawn of day to be ready, by which, some Charriots, & my Equipage should be; to hasten which he left me. We were too much concern'd in our, joy to lose the solemnizing of it by sleep, and whilst Surena was contributing to convert our hopes of safetie into an actuall one, his generous Sister, yours, and I, entertain'd one another, with the rare, and high effects of his Friendship; and with the proportionate obligation I had unto him for them. Symander was in this place of his relation, when it was interrupted by what made his Auditors think it no misfortune; For 'twas by the confus'd running in of diverse Priests of Venus, who came to acquaint their Superior, that the Dome of the Temple was fill'd with Lightnings, as bright, as ever their Goddess's Eyes did shoot; that the foundation of the sacred vault trembl'd; and in a word, that all the symptomes of the Oracles being restor'd to the liberty of speaking, were so visible, that none with reason could apprehend the contrary. Callimmachus by an erection of his Eyes, and hands, acknowledg'd his gratitude to hir, and his concern in our Heroe's, whose Pardons he begged (for Artabbanes by this time was come out of the Gallerie to participate in the Newes) that the function of his vocation would not permit him, to wait on them again 'till the morning; to which he added, that he hoped they would the sooner grant it him, since his absence was necessary to the learning of their Fate, which the next day he told them infallibly they should. With this flattering assurance, he left the generous Lovers, who, whilst Calimmachus was employ'd in preparing the Sacrifices, were in discoursing what effects they could produce. early up, and he had not long guilded with his Beams, the Pinnacles of the Temple, when the Chief of it, came to advertise them, That within an Houre the requisite oblatios would be ready; He brought in with him the Chyrurgions, who assur'd the Princes, that they had made their danger the greater, but to render so, the certainty and suddenness of their recoverie; and that they might not only go and receive the Oracle themselves, but if it commanded them a journey, they might too perform it; Neither did they only make these assurances, but by taking off their plaisters, evinced their truth, which as much surpriz'd, as pleas'd those that had receiv'd the wounds, and Callimmachus, who was no less concern'd in them, who conjur'd our Princes to reflect on the cure of the Bodie, as an earnest of that of the Minde. Artabbanes who was the most desperate Patient in that Sickness, gave Calimmachus such a reply as he was forc't to tell him. Your condition (generous Prince) cannot be worse than Mine has bin, for I have ador'd a Beautie, with a Passion, both which never knew any Superior; and though the Gods call'd hir to them in as fatall a way as ever they could the faire Parthenissa, yet those powers have demonstrated theirs, in giving me afterwards a quiet, which made me envie no ones else: They cannot be Gods were they not omnipotent, and being so, to doubt their goodness, were to inuite them not to manifest it. Artabbanes  & Artavasdes were both extreamly satisfy'd to learne an assurance of so strange a truth, from a mouth they could not doubt, which by demonstrating there were wayes of felicitie in Love without fruition, made them no longer believe, That, an impossibility, which their having 'till then done, had created their greatest Torments; And doubtless they had then obtain'd from Callimmachus a Story which was so requisite to the ease of their sufferings, as the relation of his would probably have prov'd, had not the Sacrificers come in at the same instant to tell Callimmachus, that they now expected but his presence, and Commands, to begin their Dutyes. This Summons plac'd a suspention, though not a period to our Hero's curiosities, which they had no sooner told Callimmachus, than he promist, having heard their Adventures, to acquaint them with his own. Immediatly afterwards he retir'd himselfe to put on his Pontificall Habit, which having done, he return'd to our Princes, who then perceiv'd in his Meene, that Grace, & Majesty, which 'till his having acquainted them he was of the Noble Society of Lovers, they had not observ'd; and indeed they were so entirely taken up with that contemplation, that not only they esteem'd him worthy the high Title he possest of Prince to the Priest of Venus, but they had even forgotten in that employment, how that by the dutyes of his, they were then to learne their Fate. But Callimmachus himself put them in minde of it, by conducting them downe a large Stair-Case, built of Marble, which deliver'd them into a broad Walke, border'd on either side with five Rowes of Cypress, & Myrtle Trees, promiscuously planted, which were water'd by two Springs, whose pretty murmurings pleas'd the Eare, asmuch as their clearness did the Eye, or their coolness the Taste; And though the sides of this Walke were so well adorn'd, yet the extreamities of it were much better, for at the East end, stood the Temple it self, and at the West the dwelling of the Priests, which in a Cressant extended its two Hornes to each end of the Mirtle & Cypress Trees. 'Twas in this vacuity that our Princes found all the preparatives of a Sacrifice, which was to procure them an Oracle, they had with so many impatiencies expected. The Prince of the Priests was no sooner seene by the rest, than immediatly they directed their steps to the Temple; The first that mov'd, were Two hundred Religious Men, with Garlands of Roses, and Myrtles, on their heads, and in each hand the Effigies of a Flaming Heart, to evidence, the Goddess they ador'd, was the Queene, & Inspirer of Love. After these follow'd Fifty white Bulls, & as many white Heifers crown'd with Garlands of Annemines, in celebration of Venus's changing hir fair Adonis into that flower; These were led by a Hundred young Men in cloathes, as white, as those Nature had given the Beasts they held; Fifty Maids in the same Livery carryed in their hands as many paire of Turtles; And after these, Fifty others carry'd in Silver Cages as many Swans. These were follow'd by the Augurs and Victimares, the former, bearing a Caelestiall Globe as a Badge of their Profession, and the others, some Sizers of Gold, some Sacrificeing Knives, and some Axes of Silver, as a Badge of theirs. Those Youths which carry'd the Wine and Milke, follow'd two and two, in their places & order; and last of all, some Tenne Paces before Callimmachus (who was follow'd at that distance by our Hero's) there went the Virgin who was to deliver the Oracle; She was blest with so much Beauty, that she appear'd a fit Servant for the Queene of it; Hir Robes were as white as hir thoughts; the tresses of hir Haire were so bright, and long, that they merited better to be converted into a Constellation, than Berenices did; they were ty'd up with Delphian Lawrell, & wreath'd Garlands of the same, crown'd hir Head: 'twas in this order the generous troop arriv'd at the Temple, whose Front extended it self from North to South, a hundred and Fifty Geometricall Paces; at whose extreamities were two Pavilions, whose Pinnacles seem'd to loose themselves in the Clowdes. The Walls both of these, & the Curtaine, were adorn'd with great Branches of Foliage carv'd in the stone, and in a large Compartiment compos'd of Groteskery were seene Sphynxes, Harpyes, the Clawes of Lyons, and Tygres, to evidence, that within, inhabited Misteries, and Riddles. Over the Portall was a table adorn'd with a larger Compartiment, wherein there was in bigg Letters of massie Gold inchased into a great square of Porphire, this Inscription: THE TEMPLE OF THE Goddesse OF Love, AND OF VVHAT INSPIRES IT . On each side of the Portall, there arose from the Earth two square Basements, the Plinth of each of them was beautify'd with sculptures of great Relieve; one of them was crown'd with the Statue (in Pharian Stone) of the Boy the Goddess brought into the world; And the other in Corinthian Stone, of the Boy she lov'd best in it: Our Hero's had hardly leasure to consider these few exterior imbellishments amongst so many others, because Callimmachus having given the Signall, the Sacrificers and victimaries stopt their martch, and having rang'd themselves and their victimes on either side the way, made a large one for their Prince, who still follow'd by Artabbanes and Artavasdes, went into the Quire of the Temple, which immediately eccho'd with such divers and harmonious voyces, that for a while all their faculties resign'd up their Functions to their hearing; but that Sence at length resign'd its empire to the Sight, which wanting Parthenissa and Altezeera, could not more nobly be entertain'd, than in the adornings of the Temple. The first Table was Venus ascention out of the Sea, much more white than that froth the Poets say she was compos'd of. Near this was a much larger, where the happy Paris stood Iudge of those Beauties, whose perfections came in competition, by that Apple given at Peleus wedding, by the Goddess of Discord. Never any Beauties more justly merited that name, than those the Painter had expos'd to the judgement of the happy Son of Hecuba; but yet the Artist had so much given the preheminence to hir, to whom Paris did, that he could not have declin'd doing so, without being as blinde, as hir Son. Opposite to this Picture was the Goddess's falling in Love with the faire Anchises, who grasing his Herds, little thought how near he was possessing so much Beautie,  & being Father to a Son, whose Sword was to conquer as many, as his Mothers Eyes. Neare to this last Table, was the Beautifull Son of Cinyras, who Venus more admir'd, than he did hir; & in the same Picture was contain'd all their Amour's, how she wept his being kill'd by the Boare, or his being drown'd contemplating his owne Beautie in the streame, for of both those some learned Poets have sung. Lastly hir converting his dead bodie into an Annemine, which she water'd with hir tears, and who by death being render'd uncapable to reward hir weepings, by kissing them away, seem'd eternally to blush at so unfortunate an impotence. In a word, all the reall or imaginarie Loves of that bright Goddess, were so well represented by the Artist, that if she had no cause to blush for hir electing the originals, she had as little, for avowing them in the Coppy; only indeed hir unfortunate surprize in the Arms of Mars, occasion'd by a Passion as ugly as the Possessor of it, was there purposely omitted; but the wound she receiv'd from the cruell Diomed was not, esteeming it perhaps a greater glory to evince, hir bloud gave a being to the lovely Rose, than a shame or prejudice that a Deitie could bleed. But all these representations being rather evincements, she was the Subject, than the Goddess of Love, in other Tables were the illustrations of that truth. There our Princes saw the volatile Iupiter, courting, and possessing the faire Io; the strange Metamorphosis the God made of hir to conceal his Amours from the jealous Iuno; how in spight of his disguise she discover'd them, then begs, and obtain'd the transform'd Io, of hir Lord, who grants, what he durst not refuse; how the Nymph was committed by the suspitious Goddess to the care of Argus, whose hundred Eyes were too vigilant for the offended God, who to make those Centinels sleepe eternally, that would not momentarily, sends down Mercury, who by the charms of his Musick, ends his vigilance, then with his sword ends his Life; how Iuno having first adorn'd the trayn of hir own Bird, with the Eyes of the unfortunate and faithfull Argus, to let hir God understand she not only knew, but could revenge his Murther, makes Io as frantick, as hir jealousie had made hir; who yet runs with the same celerity over the world, as she would to the embraces of hir Iupiter. The Painter in an other side of the same Table shew'd, how the Heifer flew to her Father Inachus, into whose trembling streame she leaps to quench hir heat, and thirst; from thence he makes hir run into Egypt, where she resumes hir former shape by the permission of Iuno, who had then receiv'd an assurance from Iupiter to abstain both from the desires, and acts of love; the gratefull Io in hir true shape returnes to let hir Father see it, that he might participate in hir joy, as he did in hir affliction, which latter had so operated on him, that he had wept himself so big, he was as unknowable to his Daughter, as she had bin to him; but at length, maugre their new disguises, they knew each other, and Io having perform'd this charitable dutie, returns again to the Banks of Nyle, where hir exterior, and intrinsecall Beauties, made the People which drink of that Floud, elect hir for their Goddess, under the name of Isis. In an other Table was the same inconstant God fallen in Love with the fair Daughter of Lycaon King of Arcadia; but knowing that warres of Love are different from all other, since in those, the conquest by yielding, is more pleasing than that by force, the God layes aside his power, and finding one day, the fair Calisto reposing hirself after the chase, under the friendly shadow of some Myrtle Trees, he assumes the shape of Diana, whose Nymph she was, and in that Metamorphosis enjoyes felicities which do more Metamorphose him; nay, he seems to esteem his power of altering his shape, more than that of being a God, since the former afforded him transcendenter delights in the fruition of his Calisto, than the latter, in the most powerfull effect it could otherwise produce. In the same Table was demonstrated how Diana discover'd the loss of hir Nymph's pudicitie, how she banisht hir from hir Societie, how the unfortunate Calisto was deliver'd of Arcas, all which the suspitious Iuno at last discover'd, and in revenge converted hir Ryvall into a Beare, which Arcas once had kill'd a hunting, had not Iupiter (taking pitie of both,) caught them up into Heaven, and converted each of them into a Constellation. It seem'd that the Goddess of Love took delight to have expos'd to the Eyes of Men, how much, and how often, the great Iupiter was hir votarie; for there was an other Table of his Loves with the Beautifull Daughter of Acrisius, King of the Argives, who was so strictly imprison'd upon hir Father's receiving an Oracle of his Death, by hir Sonne, that the amorous God was necessitated to convert himself into a Golden shower, to quench his flame. There was display'd in the same Table, Acrisius exposing his fair Daughter, with the young Perseus to the mercie of that Element, from whence the Queene of that Passion which created hir fault, had hir originall; how she, and hir Sonne were cast upon the Coast of Daunia, and how Pilumnus the King of it marryed hir: There was in an other end of the Pictures, the three Gorgons, Medusa, Schenio, and Euriole, with their Tresses of Snakes, and with their one Eye, with which they Metamorphos'd into stone all they beheld: In the same Table was Mercury, and Pallas, arming the valiant Perseus against these three Sisters, how he found the eldest of them, and all hir Snakes, asleepe, whose head he immediately cut off, and plac'd in his Shield, with which he turn'd Atlas King of Mauritania into stone, for denying him entertainment. In a word, there were all the actions of this demi-God, how he conquer'd the Monster, that would have devour'd the beautifull Andromeda, & how he himself was conquer'd by hir; with all those other Fables the Poets have so amply sung on this Subject: Two other Pictures contain'd the Passions of the same God to the fair Europa, and his assuming a Beasts shape, to act the sensuall part of Love; and of the Platonick Moon, who to possess Endimion render'd him uncapable to possess hir, but by dreams: There was in other tables the Amours of Aurora and Cephalus, with the Death of the unchaste and jealous Procris; and to shew the power of Love indeed, and that the Sea it self cannot quench its flames; there were also maifested at large, how the God of that cold Element fell in love with the fair Amphitrite, how she fled his Passion, and how he sent a Dolphin after hir, who prov'd a succesfull Embassador. And though all those Tables were so admirably represented, that to know the Story, you needed but to see the Pictures, yet there were two others which so intirely tooke up our Hero's contemplation, that after the sight of them, they esteem'd none of the remaining ones worthy of theirs; The first was of a Beautie which could not but be excelent, since in Artabbanes's owne opinion, she resembl'd the faire Parthenissa. 'Twas that of the lovely Psiche, she that captivated the God of Love himselfe, & was so long taken for Venus, that had she bin immortall, she had eternally (as she did for a time) rob hir of hir votaries & Altars; The Artist had so well represented this Nymph, that it Authoriz'd Venus's Enuy and Mens mistake. There was in this representation, how the King of Milesia hir Father, by the command of an Oracle, abandon'd hir to the Gods upon a Mountaine, how the Zephirs carry'd hir on their wings, into the fortunate Island to the Palace of Love, which 'till then, nor ever since, could boast of so admirable an Adornment; how the fair Psiche's two Sisters, at hir request were brought thither by the Zephirs, who envying their Sisters felicity, perswaded hir 'twas not a God, but a Serpent she blest with hir embraces; how the credulous Nymph contrary to hir engagement, conceal'd a Lampe by hir Bedds side, with which when the little God had stupify'd his Sences by too-much satisfying them, she resolv'd hir doubts, but by so unfortunate a way that a drop of Oyle fell upon Cupid, who immediatly wak'd & flew away: There were further represented the tragick Death of the fair Psiche's Sisters; The Miseries which after that fatall Night befell hir; hir descent into Hell, & at length hir ascent into Heaven, to marry hir God, who now had pardon'd hir Cryme, & thereby deriv'd a more sublime satisfaction from his mercy, than he could have had in his Revenge. The last Picture, which tooke up Artavasdes as much as the other had Artabbanes's attetio, was that of the lovely Leucothoe, who as much resembl'd the faire Altezeera as Psiche's did Parthenissa. This Table evinc'd, that Arte or Nature were admirable, the last if it presented the world with such originalls, or the first if it could fancy or describe them. This was the largest representation of any there, for it first contain'd the Amours of Phaebus and Clittie, how that the former having extinguisht all his Flames in the fountaine of Love, lighted them againe at the Eyes of the lovely Leucothoe; well did that performance prove, that light, like virtue, looses nothing by communication, for hir faire Eyes possest still as much light, as they had given the Sunn; Leucothoe seem'd to have somthing of felicity in hir Countenace, which was deriv'd, not so much from having ravisht such a votary from such a Nymph, but that Phoebus who every day beheld all the Perfections of the world, gave hirs by his adoring them, the precedency; 'Twas admirable to observe how the envious Sunne, which fades all other Beauties, did but enlighten hirs; how his perpetuall kissing hir Breasts, and not melting them, aboundantly prov'd they had only the colour, not the nature of snowe; how it was a perpetuall summer where ever Leucothoe was, how if she flung hir self under the protection of Trees, they soone lost their treasure, for hiudring the Sun from beholding his; & how that Lover, evinc'd by their immediate withering, that he could burne all, but hir that did burn him; so constant, and so bright a Servant, could not eternally be deny'd; Leucothoes coldness at length was dissolv'd, and Phaebus in hir embraces, receiv'd more joyes, than the world does in his Light; but alas, those felicities which fruition could not quench, weeping must; for the abandon'd Clittie assumes a rage proportionate to the loss which inspir'd it, and in the dictates of that Passion, acquaints Orchamus (Leucothoes Father) with hir stolen Amours; & though the betray'd Nymph in a posture as moving as hir teares, represented the glory of such an Alliance, and that to please one of the Gods, could not be a sin against the rest, yet the cruell Orchamus buryes hir alive with hir Crymes; the Sun frighted at such a Prodigie, hides his face in Cloudes; and weepes such showers of teares, that the world by his sorrow, knew his Love. 'Twas well for Mortalls that he was confin'd eternally to his Ecliptick, otherwise, to act his revenge, he had descended on the earth, and reduced all to the same Ashes, his deare Leucothoe was; which the Fates having render'd him uncapable of, he immediatly converts hir dead body into an Insence-tree, whose sweetness seem'd to reserve something of its first principle, and though dead, as much to charm the smell, or when living, the sight. In an other place of the Picture was Clittie, who Phoebus now hated as much as he had ador'd, running from one top of a Mountain, to an other, to overtake, and be near hir Lover, who to deprive hir of his sight, as well as Company, or perhaps having put on mourning for the fair, and unfortunate Leucothoe, travell'd still in a gloomie Clowd, which he had perpetually worn in revenge, and grief, had not mortals by incessant sacrifices, but especially by those offer'd of the new Insece, obtain'd the Gods comand to assume his former brightnes; which at least he did; but then Clittie found hirself doubly burn'd, by hir heat, & by his; you might have seen hir, soetimes threatning, sometimes imploring hir Lover; now invoking his power; then his justice, & finally crying out, Either stay thy course, or give me the wings of thy Inconstacy to overtake thee; hir Prayers, hir Tears, & hir Cries, operating no more on Phoebus, than that Nymphs she had betray'd, did on Orchamus, she fix'd hir Eyes incessantly on hir Lover, & by that Posture, & hir unmovableess in it, by degrees took root, & by the Gods was converted into a Marygold; who all day constantly gazes on the Sun, and all the night turns her head towards the Earth, as if she strove to force a Passage with hir Eyes thorough the Centre, to the Antipodes, not to be at any time depriv'd of seeing hir Lover. Our two Hero's found not only a resemblance in Beautie, but in Fortunes betwixt those two Nymphs, & their two Princesses; For Artabbanes was confidet the Gods had taken his Parthenissa from the Earth, but to marry hir to one of them in Heaven, as the lovely Psiche was; and in that Faith he almost apprehended to go thither, since that could not but be Hell, where he should see his Princess in an others Arms. And Artavasdes thought, that what Orchamus had done to his Daughter, Artabazus, or misfortune had done to Altezeera, who he consider'd as bury'd alive in Pacorus's embraces. The Gods having depriv'd our Hero's of seeing their Princesses, the best felicitie they could allow them, consisted in seeing what so much resembl'd them; on which they had as constantly, and perhaps as eternally fix'd their Eyes, as Clittie did hirs on hir Phoebus, had not Callimmachus acquainted them, 'twas time to offer the sacrifices of perfumes, and Turtles, which ceremony being ended, they all went out of the Temple, and immediately the Prince of it having given the signall, the effusions of Wine, and Milk, were made; some small tufts of hair which grew between the Horns of the Bulls, and Heifers, were cut with golden Sizers, and flung into the Flame; which had no sooner consum'd them, than in a Moment all the Beasts were knock'd down by the victimaries, and their Entrails torn out, and presented to Callimmachus, who consider'd the Propheticall part of them, with so sublime a joy, that it forc'd him to whisper to our Princes, that the Gods without a Miracle, and without ruining the Laws they themselves had establish'd, could not long delay their felicities, for never were greater promises in victims, than in those. This assurance brought our Hero's different Hopes, Artabbanes was joy'd in a belief that the Gods would command him to act his own Death, since he could not fancy any other way to quiet. And Artavasdes interpreted he should derive his satisfaction from their removing Pacorus, and placing him in his Felicities: but they were both diverted from any further reflections, by the Augurs giving libertie to the Swanns out of their silver Prisons, who immediately directed their flight to Heaven, as to acknowledge their deliverance from thence; and were intended thither as a sacrifice of quicker ascension than that of Insence. All these solemnities being finish'd, those which assisted at them, return'd again into an other Ile of the Temple, where stood a Statue of Venus, which took up as much, and as justly the Beholders admiration, as the Deitie could, which it represented; it was all of Mosaick work, and the peeces cimmented with such excellent Art, that the most crititicall Anatomist could not have mist so much as a veine, a sinew, or an Arterie. The Beauties of colours, of Aire, and of Features, were as exact, as those of Cimmetrie; and for Eyes, the Statue was imbellish'd with two such refulgent Diamonds, that their very lustre, like that of the Suns, hinder'd them from being consider'd but by reflection: and thereby render'd the boldly contemplating the Deities face, as great an impossibilitie, as a Sin. 'Twas at the feet of this admirable Statue, that Callimmachus prostrated himself, having in the same posture on either of his sides, one of our Princes, who with perfect attentions, and equall devotio, heard him deliver this short Prayer Fairest of all Goddesses, thou who first deriv'st that Title from Nature, and then from Iustice; Thou from whom all other Gods receive their votaries, since only by thy sweet influences, Mankinde is created, and continu'd, and sacrifices too; behold prostrate before thee, two of thy votaries, who have never offer'd on thy Altars, False, or double Fires, but have so constantly preserv'd those wounds thy Sonne first made in their hearts, that ever since they were, and are fit examples for thy subjects, to continue such; Though even their sufferings have at least proportionated their Constancie; doe not great Goddess so justly deterre Mortalls from that virtue, as to render it the ruine of those who most perfectly possess it; nor give those who allready doubt thy Power, or Iustice, so much provocation to continue their Sinn, as thy continuing the misfortunes of these Lovers will amount unto, but by investing them in felicities, as great as the Beauties they adore, evince that the tryall of Constancy, is not the punishment of it.  Callimmachus having ended his Orizon, gave the Tripos to the Virgin, who on it was to deliver the Oracle, and then with hir, and our two Hero's only, went to the vault, where they were to receive it, which was adorn'd with a Dome, that shot it selfe so high into Heaven, that none which doubted not, that was the residence of the Gods, could doubt they inhabited in it. The Virgin at the mouth of the Vault leaves those three which accompany'd hir thither, and, after hir devotions were finish'd, and that she had settl'd hir self on the Tripos, immediatly the capacious Temple, and sacred Grove were cover'd with obscure Cloudes, from whence strange lightnings, and Thunder, deriv'd their Birth; a Furious Earth-quake shook suddenly the foundation of the Temple,  & Grove; the Delphian Lawrell which crown'd the Virgins Head, fell off it; hir haire stood an end and star'd; hir Eyes roll'd wildly; hir Neck in a thousand turnings kept it self in uncessant motion; hir heart beat against hir Brest, as if it would have forc'd a passage there; hir Mouth foam'd; and in a word, all the symptomes that the Deity inspir'd and possest hir, were visible; but that which render'd it no longer capable of doubts, was a shrill voyce which fill'd the sacred Vault, & deliver'd these words:  From Parthenissa's Ashes I will raise A Phoenix, in whose Flames thou shalt be blest; VVait then about this Temple a few Dayes, And all thy Torments shall be crown'd with Rest. Then after a short silence, the voyce thus continu'd the Oracle:  Despaire not Artavasdes, since the tyme Predestin'd for thy Sufferings, is but brief; Fortune unto thy virtue shall resigne; And perfect joy, succeed to equall Greif.  Go both and sacrifice to that fair Boy, VVho did inspire my highest Greif & Ioy. Callimmachus by a short but passionate ejaculation, acknowledg'd his joy & concern in so favourable an Oracle, and then in repeated sacrifices, did the like, which being finish'd, they return'd from the Temple, the same way they went unto it, and in a deep silence, which the virtuous Priest observ'd no more, when they were enter'd in our Princes Appartment; For there by a Thousand embraces he congratulated so clear promises from the Goddess, of their future felicities. It seemes (said he) they knew your despaires were too-pregnant, to give you dark and ambiguous answers, they have now left theselves no power to continue your miseries, but by giving Men a full liberty to suspect their Iustice, so that next the being possest of your desires, you have the blest security of being so. The Oracle (Artabbanes coldly reply'd) is very clear, and 'tis as much so, that the Death the Gods hitherto hinder'd me from acting, they now promise me, by saying Parthenissa is reduc'd to Ashes: They would too have said, that all my Torments shall be crown'd with joy, not rest, had they design'd me any bessings in Life, and the Phenix they promise to raise from that dead ones Ashes, is clearly the Constancie of my Passion, in which I shall be blest by being consum'd in the flames of it; and you are not ignorant, but so unalterable, and efficatious a love, is as rare, as that Phenix to which the Oracle aludes. Callimmachus, and Artavasdes both, admir'd at so strange an interpretation, but the first of them, lest their silence might seem to authorize it, told him, If he which serves the Deitie, can best interpret hir meaning, or rather hir expressions, I can find nothing in the Oracle, but what is much advantagious for you; before this answer, you wrong'd but the mercie of the Gods in doubting your Ioyes, but now you must their Truth in any longer doing it; for they promise a blessing to your waiting for it about this Temple; if they meant your Death should be that Blessing, they would have permitted you to Act it, and not have contradicted themselves, by making your languishings the way unto it: That word of rest evidently implyes a cessation from sufferings, and fears; and that Phenix for ought we know, may be Parthenissa hir self, who perhaps is but dead to your Belief. Great Gods! (Artabbanes cry'd out) she is but too-certainly dead; Symander saw hir so; and therefore if you have no other interpretation of that Passage, I cannot but determine mine to be the true one: They cannot accomplish their promise of rest but by Death; 'tis that only after the loss of Parthenissa can give it me; they do not assure me rest as the way, but as the end, and Crown of my Torment, so that they doe not falsifie, but perfect their Oracle, in giving me no Cessation from sufferings, but by that which conferres it upon every one. Callimmachus who observ'd Artabbanes's despair did but increase by his attempting to qualify it, only reply'd; I have seen those who built their Faith on a more firm foundation than you doe yours, and yet have bin (as I hope you will be) happily mistaken; The Oracle I am convinc'd promises those blessings to you, which we must leave to Time, and the Gods to disclose; in the mean while I esteem it absolutely requisite, that you both obey their orders, by sacrificing in the Temple of Adonis; They would not enjoyn you that performance, were it not conducive to that end they have promis'd. Artavasdes having given some additionall Arguments to the silencing of his Friends despair, and the creating of his Faith in the best construction of the Oracle, at length extorted an engagement from him, that without any prejudicate opinion of it, he would expect the interpretation. The generous Armenian extreamly satisfy'd with this assurance, began to acquaint him that made it, and Callimmachus, that as soon as he had perform'd his devotions at Adonis temple, he was determin'd to make a voyage into Parthia; for one of those Assassins which had bin destroy'd by Artabbanes's Courage, had confess'd as he expir'd, that the Prince of Parthia had hir'd them to that attempt. This (he continu'd) makes me confident, Pacorus esteems Altezeera guiltie, when he esteems me fit to be so punish'd; and believing hir so, she may have occasion to employ my sword, and Life, both which I will go and offer hir; the Gods too, seem to invite me to it, by not confining my residence about this Temple as they have done Artabbanes's, who I am as much troubl'd to abandon, as at that which makes me believe my doing so necessary; but as soon as I have found whether my suspitions be rightly grounded, I will not fail to return hither, to be instructed in a Fate, I am nothing less concern'd in, than in my own. The Gods (reply'd Artabbanes) cannot but destine me some transcendent advantage by enjoyning my residence here, if they but intend thereby to recompence the Miserie of confining me from waiting on, & serving Artavasdes in his intended voyage; but I am so well verst in their inclinations for me, that if he will permit it, I will rather embrace the assured blessing of accompanying him, than out of some ambiguous hopes, decline so advantagious a certaintie. Artavasdes found this as Civill, as Callimmachus irreligious, and Artabbanes found by their returns, that these were both their beliefs. The generous Friend having absolutely declin'd the offer, and the generous Priest having induc'd him which made it, to acknowledge, he had bin in it as uncivill to the Gods, as the contrary to Artavasdes, they began to think on their intended journey next morning to the Temple of Adonis, which, Callimmachus said was not above Forty Furlongs from Hierapolis; and because the day was not a little wasted in the precedent sacrifices, and that some part of it must be employ'd in preparatives for the future ones, both he and Artavasdes conjur'd Artabbanes to enjoyn Symander (who all the while was present) to put a period to the relation he had begun. Artabbanes being satisfy'd, that in one performance he could oblige himselfe, and those he as much desir'd to doe the like unto; to effect both, retir'd to the entertainment of his thoughts, & left them to Symander's, who to obey their Comands, having first remember'd them, he was interrupted after Surena's success in the Castle of Eden, and that still he spoke the fair Parthenissa's words to Artabbanes, thus prosecuted hir Adventures. Night, when Surena according to his promise, came into my Chamber, to let me know all things for our intended journey were ready; but he was so pale, and weak, that Zephalinda, Lindadory and I, began to consider that strange alteration, as the effect of a new Misfortune; but he assur'd us it only proceeded from some loss of bloud in his late Combate; that he found himself better able to perform a journey than he seem'd to be; and that by rideing in a Charriot, he should feel no inconveniency, but what proceeded from being in a less-fitting posture to serve me. I must acknowledge he appear'd in so sad a condition, that I not only thought it less dangerous for him to indure a siege, than a journey, but told him so; and though we joyntly, and pressingly conjur'd him to reflect on his own safety, and that we would hazard ours by a residence with him, rather than so much indanger his; yet our Solicitations were fruitless; for he protested 'twould be more hazarded by the danger of my cotinuing in Eden, or by his not waiting on me out of it, and settling me in a secure residence, than any other way: His Chyrurgion too, assur'd us he might without any great hazard travell in a Charriot. This last operated more with us than all the rest; for we knew the Laws of Surena's Civility oblig'd him to contemne all danger; but we knew those of the Artist, asmuch oblig'd him to preserve his Patient from any; we therefore descended into the Court, where we found all things in a desir'd Posture, and some fifty Horse for our Convoy. Zephalinda and Lindory rode in one Charriot, and Surena (by my reiterated desires)  & I, rid in another; there was a Third for our Women: but alas, we were not gone a furlong from the Castle, when some Scouts came in, and with frighted Looks, commanded the Charriot-Drivers to turn back, if they had a Minde to preserve themselves, or those they drove. Surena at this Allarm, inquir'd the cause of it, which those that brought it, told him, proceeded from 500. of the Kings Horse, which were come a round Gallop from Nineveh; had seiz'd on all the Boats were to ferry us over the Tygris; and were by their helpe transporting themselves into the Island. Surena amaz'd at so fatall a Disaster, and as much, how what he had done could already come to Arsaces knowledge, told me; We must Madam return, unless you will rather indure the Siege of Orodes's Love, than that of his Force; he had hardly said these words, when we perceiv'd a Cloud of dust, which, some of our Convoy that were most advanc'd, came runing to tell us, was the Enemyes Troops; this made us retire hastily to the Castle, into which we were scarcely enter'd, when Surena fell into a Swound, and his wounds appear'd so inflam'd, that a Chyrurgion of our Convoy, who first at my Cryes ran to his assistance, protested to me, our return was the happiest accident could have arriv'd his Prince, for he could not have continu'd his journey, and his Life; we had him therefore brought with great care, and no less haste to his Appartment, from whence we saw a Body of Horse, which came a full Gallop near the Castle, where they drew up, and by waving their bright swords, seem'd to invite those in it to a Combate, which might change their colour. There was in Eden a young Gentleman called Arzimin, to whom Surena, as soon as he was restor'd to his sences, committed the care of the Siege, 'till his own health would permit him to assume it. Four dayes were spent in preparations for defence, and the night of the last, there came into the Castle 500 Horse, & as many Foot, who told us, that, more by Art, than by Force, they had past the Kings Armie, which next morning fac'd the Castle, and sent a Herauld to Surena, who not being in a condition to receive his Message, sent Arzimin to do it, who brought his Prince word; That Arsaces had sent purposely to know what provocation he had receiv'd, that could invite him to so precipitate & dangerous a designe; That though the highest Revenge would be but a proportionate Iustice for abusing his Authority, and Favour, yet if he would submit himself to the former, he would restore him to the latter. Surena turning his Eyes towards me, seem'd to implore the answer he was to make; but I told him, I had referr'd all things, as well as my protection to him; he therefore commanded Arzimin to let the Herauld know, that by reason of an indisposition which render'd him uncapable of making any return to the King with his own hand, he was determin'd not to send any 'till he could so do it. This he did to protract the time, and not to thrust Arsaces on extreams, 'till Vixores (who Surena then told me was raising an Armie of his Partizans) came to his relief. The Herauld deliver'd the King the Message he receiv'd, which Arsaces consider'd rather as an Affront, than a respect, and immediately by a Trumpet sent to know where our Appartments were, that he might prohibit any shooting of Arrows at those parts of the Castle; which having learn'd, he began by approches to attempt the winning of a place, which contain'd in it, the objects of his most predominant Passions, his Love & Revenge. Above a Moon was employ'd in bloudie assaults and defences, by which time Surena was so well recover'd of his old wounds, that he was in a condition to receive new ones, which before he did, by a Trumpet, and a Gentleman, he sent the King a Letter, which he first communicated to me, & which contain'd these words:  King; yet I am so happie as to be satisfy'd they are really for him. Your resolves (Sir) to make Parthenissa yours, and hirs to decline a Crown of Empire, for one of Constancie, creates my performance, which I cannot call a cryme, because 'tis to preserve you from one. This only being the cause of my Arming, I esteem'd it not fit to divulge it, but rather appear a Rebell, than manifest your Passion is one to you; when you can command it, you shall command both me, and those with me; but 'till then, I must preserve you, from what virtue should,  & thereby merit the honor of your favour, if I possess it not.  Arsaces detain'd this Messenger, 'till he had form'd a reply, which he was not a little troubl'd to doe, for if he continu'd his Passion, he must the War, and perhaps the despair of taking the cause of it; & if he seem'd to decline his Passion, he must violate his engagement, or what it may be he valu'd more. Whilst this Dilemma was debating, the Armie, and Garrison were so too; for there was, during the Treatie, no suspension of Arms, and the Arsacians storm'd an outwork, from whence they were beaten with loss and shame: Surena to let his Enemies know he was well, and could use his success so, with the greatest part of his Garrison, and himself at the head of them, made so resolute a charge upon three great Squadrons of Horse & Foot, who were to justifie the assalliats retreat, that he forc'd them all to a precipitate one, and doubtless had carry'd his Success to a sublimer degree, had not Orodes in person with 3000 select Horse, first put a suspension, & then a period to his victorie. We saw all this from off the Castle, and that Surena did miracles in his person to regain the victorie, or it, but at length most of his Forces being cut in pieces, or taken Prisoners, he follow'd the fate of the latter, which he receiv'd from a Gentleman in black Armour. But we had hardly the leasure to deplore so sensible a loss, since he that impos'd it, did redress it too, by not only giving Surena his libertie again, but by securing it, till he came to the Graffe of the Castle; Surena had but few wounds for so many dangers he had bin engag'd in; But of 1000 Horse & Foot which which made the Sally, only two hunder'd return'd alive, and half of those by their wounds continu'd not so six dayes. Our impatience to learn from whom both Surena and we had receiv'd so signall an obligation, made us go meet him in the entrance of the Castle, where he told us privatly, that it was from the Prince Ariobarzanes, who upon his knowledge of him, desir'd no other ransome for the restoring his freedome, than to grant him his Pardon, & procure him Zephalinda's for having depriv'd him of it. This Gallantry both the Brother and Sister extol'd, in terms as great as it self, & the latter perhaps esteem'd hir necessitated ingratitude to him, as high a misfortune, as Artabbanes's was to hir. The great loss we sustain'd by his Sally, reduc'd us to a condition so deplorable, that Surena himselfe began to apprehend it, and to confess his best consolation was, he should lose his Life in a Service, in which he had vow'd to spend it; and thereby if he could not prevent my misfortunes, yet he should not live to see them. The morning which succeeded this sad day, there came a Gentleman from the Camp attended by a Trumpetter, who telling the Guards he was employ'd from the King to their Prince, was admitted, and receiv'd by him in the Court, where to conceal our deficiency, all the Garrison but the Centries on the Line were assembl'd. The express presented from Orodes, a Letter to Surena, which without opening he immediatly came and presented me in my Chamber, where Lindadory and Zephalinda were, to learn the effect of it; having there unseal'd it, we found 'twas all written with Arsaces's own hand, and contain'd these words:  resentment, as well as justice, to employ my Power, rather than my Mercy; yet because you attribute your cryme to a service to Parthenissa, I shall esteem it one to me, and not only pardon your having given hir so bad a character of my Passion, as what you have acted must make hir assume, but to divest hir of Fear, and you of excuse, I doe hereby engage my selfe by all those obligations I esteem most sacred, I will be so far from forcing hir to be my Queen, that I will not solicit it, and I would even give hir leave to seek a Sanctuary under some other King, did I not know that would but too-much cloud the Government of hir own, which could not but be abhorr'd, when so much Beautie  & virtue, should be necessitated to implore a forraign Protection.  This Letter gave me joyes which were uncapable of accession, but by both your returns; I told Surena, that the cause of the War being taken away, the effects ought to cease; that doubtless Arsaces was reall in his promises, since he had (when they were freely made) asmuch the power to violate them, as he could have when I was in his, that probably my coldness had extinguish'd his Flae, which though it were no common operation in Love, yet it was (as Surena experimentally knew) a possible one, & therefore since Arsaces taking the Castle, which he had as much the power as the will to doe, might inspire him with intentions, our submission, and reliance on him would suppress, I esteem'd it the best course to accept of what we could indeed no longer decline. Surena was about to have reply'd, when one of his Servants advertis'd him, that the Gentleman employ'd by the King, had a Message to deliver him, which he desir'd might be without witnesses. I observ'd him a little surpriz'd at my motion, and it may be he was glad to cloud his disorder by this oppertunity, which he begg'd me to permit him to accept, since it was not improbable, but it might be much conducive to the forming our resolutions. I know not whether he thought the making his request was sufficient towards the granting, but he had no sooner desir'd my permission than he took it, and whilst he was entertaining the Kings express, the fair Zephalinda was entertaining me with some fears she but then had assum'd, which were; That I had avoyded being a Prey to one of my Lovers, but to be one to another. This free declaratio made me conclude she had but too-pregnant evincements for the making it, & that it was hir knowledge, not hir suspition, which gave me one of hir Brother. I acquainted hir with this belief, with as much clearness as she had me with hirs; but when she protested to me hir apprehensions had only their being from the minute of Surena's disorders, and at the overture which had created them, I began to hope hir affection for me, made hir suspect hir Brother's having too-much, which the better to determine, we joyntly resolv'd to press the accepting the Kings offer. Surena by his return, gave me leave to execute what we had resolv'd, which after I had, by the pressing'st reasons I could disclose, he told me: The just Gods, Madam, who know how unfit it is for you to put your self into the hands of one, who prefers his Lust, before his Faith, have sent me an Intelligence, which may so far absolve their Providence, that if that misfortune must be yours, it shall be your fault and not theirs. For the Gentleman sent by the King, is employ'd by the generous Ariobarzanes, who knowing, all Intelligence both by land, and water, is debarr'd me, lets me know, that Arzimin, who I thought in the last Sally had lost his life, has lost but his Libertie, and that Vixores is hastily raising an Armie of 30000 Horse, & as many Foot, for my relief; so that, Madam, you have but to assume a few dayes patience, and you may derive that reall securitie from my sword, which will prove but an imaginarie one, in Arfaces protestations. The Gods forbid (I reply'd much more confirm'd in my Fears, by this answer) that so many thousand Lives should be sacrific'd as victims for the suppression of my doubts; but allow they were of so criminall a qualitie, as that nothing but so much bloud could wash them away, yet what advantage could we propound unto our selves by a Battell, which we are not more certain of without one; for you must either resolve to expel Arfaces out of his Throne, and Empire, or at length you must trust him, and that too, when the resentments of his losses, and our opposition, may give him a rise, and provocation, to evince the justice of our Fears, by his acting them; which a Confidence in him may as much deter him from, as his very oathes; so that since of necessitie we must to prevent his Crime, act a greater, or put our selves into his Mercie, when it may be the world may esteem his conferring it, (by our provocatio) an injustice, I do not only aprove of embracing his offer, but conjure you we may do it; and this I desire the more pressingly, because that having a power to oppose his, our submission may appear our election, not our constraint, and thereby have two obligations on him; that of Religion; and that of Trust; which latter will confine him, if he considers his honor, and the former if he considers the Gods. Are you then, Madam (he reply'd) so little verst in the maxims of Kings, as to think your self secure under him, when you have demonstrated you have a Power of being so without, or against him; by shewing that Truth, and then divesting your self of it? we do not only shew him he is not absolute, but provoke, and which is worse, enable him to become so: the folly of yielding to an offended Prince, is greater than the Sin which made him so; and if we must at length submit, 'tis better doing it when our necessitie is the motive; for the extending his Mercie then, is a greater, as well as safer virtue: Do not Madam (I beseech you) tempt Arsaces's honestie, by prejudicing his Power, and Love; There is no necessitie of ending the War by either expelling him his Throne, or submitting to his Mercie, a successfull Battell may procure us such conditions, as it shall not be in his Power to infringe them, or when he sees his Passion or Empire must cease, he will relinquish the former; which were it founded on virtue, would be as permanent as the reward of it, but being on lust, and meeting such dangers, and obstructions, it will as soon expire, as would the pleasures of it. I confess this discourse made me tremble, and I could not abstain from replying: Certainly Surena, there are Passions of another qualitie than you have now given me a character of, or else you have given me an ill one of yours, or of your self; for if those which are built on virtue never expire, I must conclude, yours had not that foundation, or else is still existent. Surena found himself as much surpriz'd at my inference, as I was at what gave me the rise to make it; but after a short silence he told me; There is (Madam) no general Rule but has some exception, and 'tis I only make it in this; Neither, Madam, should I tell you an untruth, if I assur'd you, my love for you, makes me not love you; I esteem'd it but an ill effect & character of my Flame, to oppose or injure yours, & since the Gods have made the perseverance in my Passion as great a misfortune, as your not rewarding it; I transplanted that permanency the Gods had given me for a virtuous affection, on a virtuous Fiendship, and they will not so much lessen their obligation in this change, as to evidence it no miracle; which it would neither prove, nor appear, did they produce in Arsaces a resembling operatio: I told him, that to repeat was not to annihillate a Miracle; That I could not esteem a production of reason, to be one; or if there had bin one in his affection, it was in that he had assum'd, and not declin'd it; since he could not be more powerfully invited to relinquish his addresses from the unworthiness of their object, than from hir preingaged Love; which she resolv'd as eternally to cherish, as his Friendship, that had so generously contributed thereunto. I further told him, that since the extinction of his Flame, evinc'd a possibility of Orodes doing the like, and that the hazard in trusting his vowes could not be greater than that of a Battel, I conjur'd him, if 'twere upon my score, and not his own that he drew his Sword, that he would sheath it again, and not so far engage himself in hazards, as to finde both our destructions in what he intended as an argument of a Friendship, I could not be more desirous, than satisfy'd of. I began my request again (Parthenissa continu'd) to retrench all discourse of his Passion, which like a Relique, might lose its respect by becoming comon. To this Surena reply'd, by what I have done Madam, I know what will be done unto me, & that Orodes when ever he has the Power, will make use of it, to render me a sacrifice for the fair Parthenissa. This being both my faith, and my ambition (so it may be in a handsomer way, than on a Scaffold) permit me to stand upon my defence, if that succeeds, you may command your own desires, and lest it should not, let me publish, I did but conceal, not suppress my Passion, and doe you assure the King 'tis your constraint, not your inclination detains you here; and that you will accept of his offer, as soon as I permit you. This (Madam) will secure you against all misfortunes, for Arsaces cannot decline his Concessions at the very last, because your not recieving them at first was your misfortune, not your fault. All the while Surena spoke, I blusht, and somtimes trembl'd, in apprehension what he said, was not his motion, but his resolve; but not to let him know my fears by my disorders, I told him: The generous Surena has already so much oblig'd me, that if he is capable of doing it more, it must be by preserving, not hazarding himself; The latter he will but too-abudantly doe, by performing what he propounds; since Orodes will be a more dangerous Enemy on the score of Love, than Power; and will be too suspitious we will delude him, not to conclude we doe it, in so palpable a Fiction. It is not impossible too, but such a proceeding may lessen the heat & affections of your own Partizans, who though they take up Armes to defend me from being the Kings Prisoner, will hardly employ them, to continue me yours, which they must believe, or Arsaces cannot long; from whose power you shall not need create any apprehensions, since before you put your self into it, I will extort as much for your security, as I receive for my own. In brief (said Parthenissa) my requests, or my reasons were so moving, that Surena assur'd me, if at the end of four & Twenty Hours, his arguments could not appear convinceing ones to me, mine should prove so to him; and then he withdrew himself, to let the Kings Express know, that then he might return for his positive answer, whom (he said) he would not so long detaine in the Castle, lest it might look rather like an imprisonment, than an attendance. I will pass by the joys we all three assum'd at Surena's engagement, and those reasons we deduced for & against the accepting Arsaces Concessions, since those for the former, were so many, that they had exhausted all from the latter. I past that after-noon, and the Night, in as much rest, as the thoughts of suppressing so dangerous a War, and Lover, could permit; and the next day I was hardly drest, when I heard a great Noyse in the Castle, and observ'd most of the Souldiers running to the Battlements of it: The two Princesses, and I did the like, where, when we were come, we might perceive all those Plains towards the Sun- rising cover'd with Troops, we concluded 'twas Vixores's Armie, because we saw the Kings under their Ensignes in their Camp. This made me apprehend Surena had taken those 24 hours of delay, to put affairs beyond a capabillitie of reconciliation; and that he had dispatch'd the Kings Express, but to accellerate Vixores's march: As soon as I had told Lindadory, and Zephalinda my fears, they became theirs; and because by the help of a perspective Glass, we perceiv'd a Herauld go from the Kings Armie, to the other, and that in all pobabilitie he was employ'd to let Vixores know, how that Arsaces expected a return from the Castle, which might put a period to all disputes, 'till which were come, he would begin none, we determin'd in a conjuncture of time so pressing, to be so with Surena for his possitive resolve; since a longer protraction, might engage us in those miseries, I was so solicitous to avoid. Surena's coming to us, seem'd to contribute to so necessary, and just an intention; 'twas therefore I immediately acquainted him, that the longer I reflected on my Arguments for relying on Arsaces's vowes, the more pregnant I still found them; that the resolution I had then assum'd, would be so far from receiving a change by the effluction of a few minutes, that it would a confirmation; that before the 24 hours were expired, such misfortunes might arrive, as we might deplore all those of our Lives; and therefore 'twas, I conjur'd him by that Friendship he had for me, & by the just value I plac'd upon it, to permit me to go out of Eden, and that if he could not silence his suspitions, with what I did Mine, that at least I might receive the satisfaction, of not being the Authoress of shedding so much Bloud, and of involving my Countrey in a Civill War. Surena having commanded all the Souldiers to their Posts, prostrating himself at my Feet, told me, 'Tis now Madam, no longer time to dissemble a Passion which I clouded, but could not extinguish; I had too-unresistable a Ryval in Arsaces, to continue, and declare my self his; I was necessitated therefore by art, to supply the defects of power; neither did I, Madam, delude, but serve you in this disguise; I believe you will finde I doe so too, in this discoverie; since without it, you must have put your self in the hands of one, who would be satisfy'd with nothing but possessing you; whereas you are now in ones, that if he cannot from a perfect Passion enjoy that blessing himself, he will never pretend higher, than to keep all others from it. I go now, Madam, to take from Arsaces as absolutely the power of making you his Queen, as the just aversion you have contracted for him, has alreadie taken away all means of becoming so, but that; & I hope before the Sun sets, to evince, by the sacrificing of so many Thousand Lives for your preservation, how pretious 'tis unto me. Surena had no sooner done speaking, than he rose up; and having saluted me, went hastily away: I had neither the designe, nor the power to stay him, the first proceeded from my aversion from seeing, and the latter from my disorders of having heard him, which were so transcendent, that the consolations of Lindadory, and Zephalinda, were so far from silencing my trouble, that they created it, by believing Mine was capable of being supprest. Oh Gods! what did I not utter against so black an infidelitie? & how I quarrell'd with my self, for having trusted my protection to him, who made me need any: but whilst I was in the highest resentments those reflections inspir'd me with, they were interrupted by many shouts, and cryes; and turning about to learn from whence they proceeded, I perceiv'd it was from a great Bodie of Vixores's Army, which were fallen upon one of the Kings Guards, that was most advanc'd towards the Castle, which after a bloudie dispute, they beat up, & thereby gave Surena the libertie of joyning with him, which he omitted not, for we saw him immediately row over the Tygris, and recover his Armie: soon after the Kings was drawn out of their Camp, which we learn'd, proceeded from Surena's having assur'd him in a letter, of all that he had me, which so fill'd Arsaces with fury, that finding he could not end the War by continuing the Siege, he resolv'd to attempt it by a Battell; and because his rage was of a quality that could not admit of delay, and there being light enough left for so bloudy a dicision, they instantly began it, but it ended not 'till the day did, which prov'd a glorious one to Arsaces, whose Victory was witness'd by the death of 40000 of his Rebells; which Number yet had bin much increast, if the obscurity had not hinder'd it. The two Brothers, better follow'd in the Flight, than in the Charge, took severall wayes; Vixores to raise a new Army, & bring their Fates to another experiment; and Surena, who had secur'd that Post upon the Tygris which his Army had recover'd before the Battell, made it the place of ralliment, where finding too-many for the Siege, and too few for the Field, he selected 2000, and dismist the rest; who by severall wayes found severall Fortunes, some scaping, some loseing their liberties, & others their Lives. Surena employ'd all that night to ferry over his Men into Eden, which he did, though with the loss of a Fourth part of them, who being left to justify their Post, were kill'd in it, by a successfull assault of the Kings, so that all the advantage Surena deriv'd from the Battell, was to get a Garrison to maintain a Siege. The day after this troublesome one to him, he made it a resembling one to me, by giving me a visit: but as soon as he came into my Chamber, without permitting him to speak, I told him; Traytor, with what Face canst thou present thyself before me? when thy actions, & the Gods by thy defeat, have bestow'd on thee that Name? 'tis doubtless to increase thy Crymes, by the continuing of my Punishment, which the seeing thee, but too-abundantly does; Madam (said Surena) I doe now no longer wonder the Gods deny'd me success, when you deny'd me your Prayers for it; 'twas the want of them gave our Enemy the Victory, which it may be, if he had intirely the Power, he would employ it, to act worse designes, than you can esteem me capable of thinking; but I have so many fresh resourses of Men, that before you fall into Arfaces hands, he must leave himself as few Subjects, as now he besieges; and it may be rather than cause the ruine of your Country, you will hinder Mine. Yes Madam, you will see Armies again in the Field, which shall invalidate your Prayers; and the Gods who know how much fitter 'tis to give you your security, than your revenge, will confer the victory on him, who will less offensively employ it. If the Gods (I reply'd) should take so strange a Course for the punishment of Orodes Sins, as to let one of his Vassalls act it; yet the end to which thou believ'st that Victory conducive, shall be deny'd thee; I have resolutions which no materiall power can so much as reach, much less conquer, and if I were not confin'd to love Artabbanes as his reward, I would doe it as thy punishment. Certainly Madam, (Surena coldly reply'd) if you love Artabbanes still, you sufficiently evince, you are confin'd to it; his jealousie else had made you deny him afterwards that honor; and it cannot be but Fate, which makes you have a Passion for one who suspected your virtue, and an aversion for him who ador'd it, though it has prov'd as cruell to the Latter, as kind to the Former. Here (said Symander) my Prince who had hitherto listen'd with a wonderfull silence, was necessitated to break it, by telling his Princess; I hope Madam, you gave him no other reply, than what is the only, and the true one; which is, that 'twas not my jealousie, but my reason made me apprehend the fair Parthenissa was too-great a Blessing ever to become Artabbanes's. Parthenissa blusht a little to have spoke what had necessitated Artabbanes to interrupt hir Story, & to make so flatering a justification; 'twas therefore she hinder'd the continuance of it, by telling him; I had but too-much truth to alleadge in your vindication, to make use of a return, which had nothing of that virtue in it; wherefore the answer I gave him, was; It would rather appear an effect of Fate, did I decline a Passion for Artabbanes, to confer it on one, whose manifested Treachery, so Artificially made him doubt mine, that the Offence of doing so, could not be so great, as the impossibility of avoyding it. Thou canst not therefore mention Artabbanes's seeming cryme, but thou must publish thy reall one; But to take from thee all fresh occasions to injure the Gods, as well as me, I protest by them, that if their power know any limitation, 'tis in the impossibilitie of making me receive thy Passion, or so much as listen to thy addresses with Patience. There is, Madam, (he reply'd) nothing impossible but to him that believes it; 'tis only the Faith of apprehension, not reason; or if there be impossibilities, my declining the ambition of possessing you, or permitting any other the doing it, are the only ones. He spake something else, though I did not hear it, for I withdrew, and lock'd my self up in my Cabbinet, which for six Moons was my only sanctuary from such importunate visits; But his generous Sister assum'd at his change so exorbitant a grief, that it even brought an accession to mine; the fair Lindadory by hirs did the like; and though I both conjur'd them to lessen the cause of their Tears, by removing themselves from the subject of them, yet they would never consent to my request, neither had they, would Surena have permitted it, who one day let me know so much, when I motion'd their removall to him, and who transferr'd his denyall upon the indecencie of wanting some of my own Sex to be near me. Zephalinda a thousand times fruitlessly essay'd to let Ariobarzanes know the truth of our condition, which she suspected hir brother had kept from his knowledge, and thereby made that seem an effect of his Art, which was one of his Treachery: This she was the more intent upon, knowing that every opportunitie Ariobarzanes (who was Lieutenant Generall to Arsaces, and condemn'd his desires on me, which by the infusions of Surena, he consider'd thorough a false optick) sent him constant Intelligence, under pretence of concluding an exchange of Prisoners, mutually made so by fortunate, and unsuccessfull Sallyes, whose retail I decline telling you, since 'tis sufficient you know they were frequent, and bloudie. I believe you are confident, that I was so of Surena's not attempting against my honor, since I solicited the removall of those, whose presence might have restrain'd any desires of so criminall a quality; and truly I must doe him that justice, as to acknowledge he had nothing of offensive in his Love, but his Love, which was as civill, as unsuccessfull. Though the violence of the Winter were great, yet it lessen'd not that of the Siege, which was so active, as it left no time to feel the rigour of the Season. But the Spring which brought weather fit to continue the War, brought Surena newes of his impossibilitie of doing it, for by the return of a Prisoner (purposely made so) for that end, he receiv'd from Ariobarzanes the certaintie of Vixores's repeated defeat, which was given him by the Prince Phraates, expresly sent by his Father to interrupt his leavies, or destroy them, which latter he effected, though much of the Glory, and more of the danger, fell to the young Phraataces, illegittimate Son to Phraates, not then above 16 years of Age, whose Mother by hir excellent Beautie had bin Concubine to Caesar, & who by him had bin presented to Phraates, as an other was at the same time of resembling Beautie, and profession to Pacorus: But he return'd hir again to Caesar, as a fitter present for his restitution, than acceptance. Surena at this fatall Intelligence, found as small hopes to preserve me from his King, as to obtain me for himself, & I began to assume some, that what he had deny'd to me, he must grant to his necessitie. But Vixores, though he had lost the possibilitie of raising the Siege, yet he had not of enabling his Brother to continue it, which to effect, with the reliques of his broke Army, of which he had lost 22000, he advanc'd by long Marches, and unfrequented wayes, with 2000 Foot, which he had mounted, and by his admirable celeritie & silence, came so unexpectedly to the Banks of Tygris, that the Kings Eyes gave him the first intelligence of his being there, which was no sooner receiv'd, than all the Boats upon the River were drawn to one place, for the ferrying over some Horse to cut off this relief: Surena to facilitate the entry of it, made a furious Sally, and Vixores, the better to palliate his fiction, made a brisk one against the Arsacians, with Two thousand Horse, with which he had convey'd the Two thousand mounted Foot, who all this while having quit their Horses, lay conceal'd in a Grove two Furlongs above Arsaces's Guard, which was next to the Castle, from whence during the Allarm, they sent over some excellent swimmers, who fastening Ropes on that side the River, by Ten Flat- bottom'd Boats, which as many Dromedaries had brought, and which for the conveniency of carriage, were made of Wicker, cover'd with Hides, without rowing, or driving down the stream, in one hour, they had transported over all the Souldiers; but as they were beginning to doe the like to the Provisions, which Surena wanted more than the Men, some of the Kings Horse, who by a Prisoner taken from the Convoy had gain'd intelligence of this relief, came, and by a furious charge render'd themselves Masters of the most necessary part of it. The Souldiers who were in the Island, seeing the loss of their victualls, and knowing it irrecoverable, lest a longer delay might render the Castle so too, by a hasty march under the Banks of the Tygris, which by a continu'd frost had left a large strand, and by the obscurity of the Night (which then had for above two hours cover'd the Heavens) they safely arriv'd in Eden; but Surena's joy at it immediatly vanisht, for by the loss of his Provisions, he found his Brother had sent an increase, rather than a relief of his wants, who concluding he had given time enough for the entry of the supply, by degrees began to diminish the violence of the Combat, which finally, an hour after, absolutly ceast. Vixores in this performance shew'd himself so much a Souldier, that none which was so, could not but conclude his precedent defeats proceeded not from his not being one. That Night by a long March, he put himself out of the necessity of making a second, for he had so far out gone those Troops which follow'd him, that by easie journeys he reacht again the Province of Hircania, which though Phraates had much destroy'd, yet Vixores despair'd not, but from those Warlike People, and that provocation, to bring again a third Army into the Field, which might render him Master of it. Surena was costrain'd by his little victuals, & many Souldiers, to make frequent, & furious Sallyes, where to lose of his own Men, or to kill of the Kings, were equall advantages. One Evening, as the two Princesses, and I, were walking on the Battlements of the Castle, we heard a noyse in the Court, which we learn'd proceeded from the arrivall of Arzimin, who having deceiv'd, or corrupted his Guards, had then Fled from the Camp, & recover'd the Castle. Surena assum'd a visible joy at the escape, & return of so considerable a Friend. Three or four Dayes successively after, I fancy'd Arzimin by his looks had some desires to speak with me, but apprehending he had taken them up upon Surena's score (whom I never, after our first discourse, permitted to make me a second) I declin'd all oportunities of facilitating his design; but at length, having acquainted the Princesses with my belief, and suspitions, they were joyntly of opinion, that I should no longer defer giving Arzimin an opportunity I had hitherto deny'd him, since if he had any thing to act for me (which his strange escape from the Camp render'd no irrationall belief) by re-trenching all discourse with me, I did too, all possibility of serving me; & if what he had to deliver were on Surena's accompt, I ought speedily to give him one Audience, to have a just ground for denying him for ever another. Their opinio was my resolution, which immediatly after I had assum'd, I had the opportunity to put it in practice, for the same day, as we went to take the Ayre in the Gardens of the Castle, which because we frequently did, Arsaces had given an obey'd Command, that no Arrowes, or Darts should be shot or flung that way; Arzimin, who waited for me at the Door, came, and presented me his hand to lead me down, which I accepted, & which I had no sooner done, than he told me softly; I have somthing Madam of concernment to inform you of, but I must humbly beg it may be without witnesses; I told him, in the same tone, that I would give the opportunity he desir'd, as soon as we were in the Gardens, whither being come, we insensibly lost the two Princesses, and those that follow'd us; which Arzimin being convinc'd of by looking diligently every way, he flung himself upon his Knees, and presented me a little Note, which I open'd and found, was all of Arsaces hand, and only contain'd these words: Madam, I beseech you believe all he shall tell you, and be satisfy'd of his Fidelity, on my engagement for it . After I had read these few words, and assur'd him they had all that efficacie both the King,  & he could expect, I made him rise, lest being surpriz'd in that Posture, it might raise a suspition, which continuing our walk, would prevent; when he was up, he told me; I believe, Madam, you are not ignorant I was dangerously hurt, and taken Prisoner in that unsuccessfull Battell Surena fought against his King; and that I might not have so noble a fate as that of dying by my wounds, they were diligently cur'd, and then my sentence was, that that Life I had employ'd against my Prince, I should lose upon a Scaffold; whither when I was brought, & expected the fatall stroak, I receiv'd a Pardon: Arsaces making a distinction between those which fought against him, and those which fought for Surena, of which latter quallitie he was assur'd I was, from the Prince Ariobarzanes. This grace which I as little expected as deserv'd, produc'd so just an effect in me, that I determin'd to employ my Life for him, that had given it me; in pursuance whereof I obtain'd a private Audience from the King, without so much as the knowledge of Ariobarzanes, who I knew, too-much favour'd Surena's designes, to be trusted with mine. There 'twas, Madam, I told the King a Truth, of which I believe you are yet ignorant, which is; That Surena having long form'd a designe of carrying you away into Media, and of living there under the protection of Merinzor, (of which you may be partly convinc'd, by his having declar'd himself to you to be, what he never yet but was) finding by those unexpected wounds he receiv'd, when he made your Guards your Martyrs, that he was unable to flie with you thither, and as unable to trust you there without him; the better to delude your belief, he caus'd one of his Chyrurgions to tell you, and the two Princesses, he was in a condition to perform the journey, when he had not the power to do it; and which to prevent, he caus'd 500 Horse, he had covertly drawn together, to be his, and your Convoy into Media, to appear as so many of the Kings, and thereby made you return hither, as if it had bin by misfortune, not designe; and if you remember Madam, a Chyrurgion of the Convoy, who knew nothing of his Prince's intentions, told you when he fell into his fainting, that he could not continue his journey, and his Life. I remember'd that passage (said Parthenissa) very well, and from thence concluded Arzimin told me a Truth, I had but too-many pregnant Testimonies no longer to doubt. Orodes, Madam, (continu'd Arzimin) was as much surpriz'd at this intelligence, as I perceive you are; and those Troops which were your seeming besiegers, 'till those of Arsaces were really so, then became your defenders; and when Orodes sent you an assurance of attempting nothing against the Laws of Honor, in obtaining that of your Affection, Ariobarzanes (as you know) sent Surena word, that Vixores with a numerous Armie was readie speedily to Attempt his Relief: 'Twas then, Madam, to avoid the spilling of so much bloud, and of not demonstrating any diffidence in the Kings so solemne engagements, that you prest Surena to permit you to rely on them, who finding your desire was your resolution, begg'd you to consider of his Arguments for 24 hours, and then he would obey your election. He did this only that in the mean time he might engage both Armies, that if the victorie inclin'd to his side, he might keep you in his Power as an effect of his Friendship, not his Love; and if it inclin'd to the Kings, he might ascribe the Battell, by his being so strictly besieg'd, to the impossibilitie of his preventing it, and then by accepting the Kings offer, reserve the disclosing his Passion to a more promissing opportunitie. This, Madam, was the Cause, that under a pretence of not detaining the Kings Messenger so long, he immediately dispatch'd him to Ariobarzanes, whom he pressingly desir'd to let Vixores know, that if within 24 hours he brought not their Fates to a decision, no misfortune could be greater than that delay. Ariobarzanes did this to serve Surena, who has promis'd him his Sister, and to end a War, which would as long as it continu'd, deny him the felicitie of seeing Zephalinda. This designe had doubtless succeeded, if the Gods (who cannot more convincingly manifest themselves to be what they are, than by punishing infidelitie) had not necessitated Surena to disclose so criminall a fallacie: for though Vixores with all his Armie came early enough, and by a Thousand provocations solicited the King to a Battell before the 24 hours were effluxt, yet Arsaces, though equall in forces, would not accept it, hoping by the return then promist, without Bloud to end the difference: Surena by this delay concluded of the cause of it, and thereby observing he could not any longer cloud himself, and that so powerfull an Army might justify his Cryme, boldly confest it to you, & then went to punish in his King, what he practic'd in himself; but he soon found in his defeat, how the Gods disavow'd his Quarrell, which (said Arzimin) I am now convinc'd of, and consequently will no longer defend. 'Tis therefore (Madam) as an expiation for having done it so much already, that I have engag'd my self to Arsaces to deliver you out of this Captivity, or to lose my Life in attempting it; & as one of your Protectors become your Keeper, so to make one of your Keepers, become your Deliverer; The two Princesses if they know of your escape, must not accopany you in it, neither is it necessary, for being Prisoners but upon your Accompt, your liberty will restore them to theirs; I found this rationall, but not kind, and therefore determin'd, if 'twere not their desire, as well as opinion, I would repay them the obligation of continuing a Prisoner with them, as they had with me; but this I told not Arzimin, who thus prosecuted his discourse: To morrow Night (Madam) I have the Guard, and I have order'd it so, that those which compose it are my Creatures, especially such as are of the water-gate where the Gally which belogs to the Castle is at Anchor; In hir, Madam, I designe to carry you away, which Arsaces approves; and because I suspected Surena has so many Partizans and Spies in the Army, that if the King should give orders to any of those Guards upon the River, to receive the Gally which should come out of the Castle as Friends, it would inevitably come by the multitude of Surena's, to his knowledge. I have perswaded Arsaces under the pretence of an intelligence, to draw all the Boats on the River to the upper end of the Island, so that none of the Guards being able to follow us, we need not trust their Faiths with so dangerous a secret. And the Tygris is of such a breadth, that in the obscurity of the Night, keeping under the Island-shoar, they can hardly discover us, or if they doe, not reach us with their Arrows; I am necessitated too, to let the Gally drive down the stream under the Banks of the River, lest crossing over it, some of our owne Centries on the Towers, might discover, and offend us; for they will know by the smallness of our Numbers, and by Surena's not seeing, or acting in our attempt, that it is not a Sally, but a flight. The King, Madam, will expect you at a little Village some Twenty Furlongs below the Castle, and to secure you from any fears, that you doe but avoyd one Imprisonment, to fall into another, he has commanded me to protest in his behalf, by all the tutelary Gods of his Empire, and by what ever else he holds in higest veneration, he has banisht all those Thoughts from him, which have so long banisht you, and to take from himself the power of a relapse, if ever he should have the will, he has already given order for the revocatio of Artabbanes exilement, & to repair his having sent him into it, he will with the restoring him to his Country, restore him too, to his Princess. Arzimin had more particularly acquainted me with the residue of what he was to deliver, had not he perceiv'd (a far off) Surena coming into the Garden, which made him desire me to hasten my joyning with the Company, which whilst we were doing, he told me, that the Night appointed, four hours after the close of the Evening, he would not fail to come to my Chamber with my disguize, and to have all things so exactly prepar'd, that it must be Fate, and not chance if his designe succeeded not. I had hardly assur'd him there should be no omission on my Part, but we had recover'd the Company, & suddenly after Surena appear'd in the same walk we were in, which made me quit it, and retire to my Appartment, where having shut our selves up, I told Lyndadory, and Zephalinda, all that Arzimin had me; To be brief, those two admirable Women, for all my reitterated Prayers, would not be sharers in my escape, lest they might prejudice it, and if I condiscended to their commands of going away alone, it was purely from a Confidence, that as soon as I was out of the Castle, Surena would yield it, and consequently the Princesses would be restor'd to a liberty by me, which they would not accept of with me, Zephalinda too, by not going with me, could leave hir Brother nothing but suspitions that she knew of my Flight; and Lindadory was so apprehensive, that hir accompanying me in it, might convince Surena, 'twas the craft, and not the ignorance of his Sister detain'd hir, and so pleas'd with a recluseness, which both your absences made hir cherish, that upon those scores as well as the former, she determin'd to remain with the fair Zephalinda, who conjur'd me I would employ that Power I had with Arsaces, to procure a Pardon for hir Brother, who had no other Title to my Mercie, than that he deserv'd it not: I assur'd hir, that what should now be my obedience, had bin my designe, and that one so near in bloud to Zephalinda, could not but be so, in my care. At length, the so-impatieted night and hour came, and with it Arzimin, who brought me one of his Pages Clothes, which he said was necessary for me to wear, & that I should do it no longer than 'till I were out of the Castle, I joyfully put on that Liverie of Freedom, and having a thousand times embrac'd the Princesses, I took my finall leave, and only with Arzimin, whom I follow'd as his servant, came to the Guard of the Water-Gate, where I found the Souldiers sleeping on the Ground, & in so wretched a way, that I have never since esteem'd it courage, but judgement, to cast themselves upon whatsoever hazard may finish such miserable Lives. Arzimin immediately put me into the Gally, and taking Seven Men to rowe, and steer hir, without any noyse got out of the Water-percullis, and in the same silence descended the Current for above Three hours; during which, I had again put on the habit of my Sex in the Cabbin, in which I had lockt my self up; when I was drest, I came out, and found of our Seven, but. Three in the Gally, of which Arzimin was one, of whom I askt, what was become of the rest, and how soon we should land? he told me the other Four were gone in a little Skiff which belong'd to the Gally, to tell Arsaces of my Approach, and that it would be an hour before we should go ashoar, because he durst not make use of his oars: I retyr'd my self satisfy'd with that reply, and at the expiration of the hour, Arzimin came to let me know I was safely arriv'd where he intended; immediately after, one of the Gally carry'd me out of it in his Arms to a Charriot, which with some Thirtie Horse expected us. I thought it something strange that Arzimin himself did not doe it, or that he commanded not some other fitter for the employment than he which had undertook it; but I thought it much stranger, whe I saw him too, come only into the Charriot with me, & when I found him by the help of the Light which the bega to dawn, to be Surena, Oh Gods! as soon as I knew him, I knew my self betray'd; I had only force enough to say so, for all my Senses were so obliging as to cease their actings, rather than by continuing them, so extreamly to afflict me: but Surena, who had more care of my life, than me, by powerfull Cordials brought me to my self; I pay'd his care with a Thousand Injuries, and if my hate were as great a torment to him, as that Life he restor'd me to, was to me, I could neither have desir'd, nor acted a more sublime revenge. 'Twas either his respect, or his guilt, which all that day kept him in a deep silence, and if he any way evinc'd how much my discontent was his, it was only in sighs. The first Night (after a very long journey) we lay at a Castle which was scituated in so solitarie a place, that I believe it was only built for that end to which Surena then employ'd it: He led me to a Chamber that wanted nothing but his absence, and that conveniencie it soon enjoy'd, for without speaking one word, he saluted me with great humilitie, and left me to the companie of my Thoughts, which in the condition I was in, was the worst I could keep, but his. I had not long the libertie to entertain them, for a young Gentlewoman came into my Chaber, to offer me hir Service then, and if I pleas'd for ever; I accepted of it in the first limitation, but declin'd it in the latter, lest she should have serv'd Surena, and not me. An hour after, Supper was brought in, and that being ended, my new woman resign'd hir place to Surena, who kneeling at my Feet, told me; You see (fair Parthenissa) prostrate before you, one who should not have the confidence to doe it, did he not believe the not imploring your pardon, a greater misfortune than any, but the not obtaining it; If I have deluded your hopes, I will not your belief; for though I have not given you into Arsaces power, yet I protest by your self, I will employ mine to defend and serve you, which I am confident is your Faith, and which I assure you cannot be more so, than it is my inviolable resolution; 'twas necessity, Madam, and not election, made me draw you from a place, where I had no longer the means to preserve you from abandoning a Servant, who is as much concern'd in your honor, as you are to put your self into the power of another, who would have employ'd all his to destroy, not defend what you value most; I doe not accuse my King, that you may the less condemn me, I am so far from desiring his crymes, that I would give my Life he had none; for thereby you had bin exempted from inconveniencies, which would would be unsupportable, were they not in order to the preventing of greater. Your residence, Madam, with Arsaces, I am convinc'd, would make you wish, when perhaps too-too-late, that you had prevented it by greater troubles, than I hope you will suffer in your journey; for I have so well deluded him, that you may take your own Hours of travell, and that which will end yours, will be a Castle of Merinzors in Media, the first place to which we intended our flight, had not an unhappy accident prevented it; & Media, Madam, being the Kingdom your Artabbanes must one day possess, I elect to wait on you thither, that your Reason, if not your justice, may be secur'd of the innocency of my designes, for had I any which were criminall, I would not have chosen that place for the Scene to act them, where your happy servant canot want hands to act his Revenge. Surena (said Parthenissa) told me many things of this quality, and so protested, his ambitio was to solicit, not force my Affection, that I determin'd, since I could not prevent the former, not to provoke him to the latter, which the uttering of my just resentments, I apprehended would; 'twas therefore I told him; Though your past Crymes might invite me rationally to conclude you capable of any, yet I will not disbelieve your vowes, and professions, which if ever you designe to violate, I have the power and the resolution to prevent; Doe not necessitate me to owe that safety to my self, which I am not unwilling to derive from you, nor attempt to practice that, which you so justly condemne in another, and which you esteem'd so foul a Sin, that to prevent it, you esteem'd Rebellion None. Madam (said Surena) did it not too- much wrong the Beautie of Truth, to arm it with many protestations, I should by reitterated ones, binde my self by Religion to that, which I am sufficiently confin'd unto, without it; and were it lawfull for Surena to repine at any thing the fair Parthenissa sayes, he had now but too-abundant an occasion to doe it, for she must believe him as wicked, as unfortunate, to conclude he stood in need of any other Argument to deter him from attempting against hir honor, than the greatness of the Cryme, but Madam, my deportment shall be so innocent, that you will in the future esteem your doubts as great an injury to your self, as I can now esteem them to me. I found, though his Expressions were humble, that he was highly mov'd at the cause of my fears; 'twas therefore I reply'd; I hope Surena, you will not much condemn me for runing into an error, where the discovery of its being one, will prove my satisfaction. Your satisfaction Madam (said Surena) shall be still more considerable to me than my own, and since I have that invitation, as well as that of virtue, I shall as much apprehend any crimminall designes, as the fair Parthenissa does detest them; thereupon having wisht me but asmuch rest as I could confer on him, he withdrew himself to leave me to mine. But I took none, out of an apprehension that I had done amiss in acquainting him with my fears; for 'twas not impossible, but to think him capable of that Sin, was to provoke him to it, since the very performance could not raise in me a worse beleif of him, than that was of fearing he would perform them. This reason, and many another of a resembling efficacy, made me conclude, that my having declar'd my doubts, was a greater prejudice, than those assurances I had from thence deriv'd, was an advantage. You may believe, in such disturbances of the Minde, the Bodie could not but participate, so that I was earlyer up, than he that was more concern'd in my being so, and I quited my Bed, not only because I could take no rest in it, but that I resolv'd to add to the obligation of virtue, that of trust, and to go freely to what else I knew I should be constrain'd unto; Surena therefore found me drest when he came to tell me all things were readie for our journey, if I was; which having told him, he led me to the Charriot, that had all the journey, the same 30 Horse for Convoy, that it had at first; Surena begged and had my permission to ride with me in it. The Fifth day after we had left the Castle of Eden, we came into Media, which we learn'd was all involv'd in a Domestick War. This made Surena travell with more caution than he had thitherto observ'd, so that constantly he left a couple of his Guard some four or five Furlongs behinde, and sent half a score before, that he might not be surpriz'd. The third day after he had settled this order, one of those, to whose care all Intelligece which should happen in the reare was left, came full speed to acquaint his Prince, that his Companion had bin kill'd by a Partie of Horse which follow'd him a round Gallop. Surena at this Intelligence, leapt out of the Charriot, and whilst he was arming himself, made me many appologies for so rude a proceeding; but he was no sooner fitted to receive his Enemies, than he perceiv'd them, who without any cheapening, charg'd him so roundly, that he found he might need those Ten Horse for the Fight, which he had sent for Intelligence; one of his Pages went therefore to call them, but two of the unknown Partie, having charg'd thorough all Surena's, came to my Charriot, & having begg'd me to pardon a rudeness which was for my service, one of them immediately kill'd the Driver of it, & the other with his sword, cut the Traces assunder; but this performance cost them their Lives, which they lost by Three of their Enemies, who fear'd those came not to hinder my flight, but to contribute to it. The Combat being perform'd by Men of singular valor, was very bloudie, & in less than half an hour, were reduc'd to so few, as only the chief of either Partie: He of the unknown one, by his unimitable courage, had reduced his Adversary to a condition which needed help, when the Generous Artabbanes interpos'd himself for their reconciliation, and then, from an Intercessor, became a Partie, not knowing he that was vanquish'd, was guiltie; but he abundantly repair'd that mistake, by defending (after the return of those Ten Horse which were recall'd) a Life, I am much more concern'd to have preserv'd, than to have Surena's destroy'd. 'Twas this (said Symander) that the fair Parthenissa put a period to a relation, which had as much taken up Artabbanes, and Sillaces's wonder, as attention. I will not tell you how infinitly the first of them exclaim'd against the perversness of his Fate, for having render'd the acting his Revenge as great an offece, against his Friendship, as the omission of it was one against his Love. But the fair Parthenissa, who desir'd no greater punishment for Zephalinda's Brother, & who indeed could wish him no greater, than to be out of his protection, and under his Ryvalls, conjur'd him to be contented with that Revenge, with which she was. Artabbanes, was not sorry, that to the invitations of Friendship, he had that additionall one of obedience, for the silencing his designes of vindicating his wrongs; but they being of too-sublime a nature absolutely to be forgotten, lest his disorders might discover he disputed whether he should obey Parthenissa, with hir permission he conjur'd the generous Sillaces to acquaint them, by what strange adventure he was presented with the blessing of serving hir. Sillaces, who receiv'd as sublime a satisfaction in his obedience to Artabbanes and Parthenissa, as he had in hearing hir storie, began his owne short one, in these tearms: From the time I left Rome, 'till I cae to Nineveh, there happe nothing worth relating, but that there happen'd nothing that was so: But alas, this calme was but too-severely interrupted, for there I understood, how that both the Princess Lindadory & Parthenissa, could not more want my service, tha I did the power of paying it the: My dutie to Arsaces, and hope, that by being nearer the Castle of Eden, I might be so to an opportuity of what so extreamly & justly I ambition'd, made me immediately repair to the Camp, where by the King I was receiv'd with such demonstrations of affection, that I thought Surena's past favour, and present condition, had thither to depriv'd me of that usage, and then conferr'd it on me; but my ignorance, whether this proceeded from his goodness, or designe, made me keep him in a perfect one of your condition, and resolutions; & though I endeavour'd all immaginable wayes to serve you, and my self in the Princesses; yet the only one in which I did it, was, in perswading the generous Ariobarzanes, to doe Surena no more services, unless he receiv'd an assurance from the fair Zephalinda, that in doing them to hir Brother, he did them too, to hir; This I did out of a confidence Surena had deluded him, and this Ariobarzanes did, not to shew me in that confidence, that I was so; but when to many Letters of his to Zephalinda he never receiv'd any return, he began to disclose a Truth which his so long ignoring had render'd obstructive to his Kings ends, & his own: I believe this proceeding hasten'd Surena's, for with his Intelligence, he lost his hopes; but whilst I lay languishing in desires & fears, a Packet came from Merinzor to Surena, and by the Carrier of it was deliver'd to Ariobarzanes, but by what I have related, he was become from his Confident, his Enemy; wherefore opening the letters, he found in them a black conspiracy of raising a mutuall Rebellion against their Kings, and of affording each other reciprocall assistance. This I esteem'd our duties to acquaint Arsaces with, & this Ariobarzanes did so too, as an expiation of having formerly convoy'd some of Surena's Letters to Merinzor, when he knew not what they imported, & whe he was made believe they only were to preserve a Corespondency, which might preserve the latter a sure retreat; but the difficulty was, how to let Orodes know of these Letters, & not to let him know, we had seen them before; this at length we did, by causing a Confident of ours, to bring them hastily into the Camp, as having taken them from one who by the River was stealing into the Castle, and which by his Death he had prevented. Orodes having perus'd them, found Surena's Rebellion the more dangerous, and that a Forraigner fomenting it, would render it as long, as hazardous. 'Twas therefore he immediatly call'd me to him, where after having told me, that since Ariobarzanes had the next Command under him, all others in the Army would be under me, and that therefore 'till he could finde me out a fit employment, he desir'd I would take upon me that, of being his Embassador to the King of Media, to acquaint him with this fresh Treason, and to procure a League between them, that as two of their Subjects had reciprocally bound themselves to ruine their Kings, so that they should doe the like, to ruine them. This (continu'd Sillaces) I obey'd, partly because I had no employment in the Army, but chiefly that my hopes were less, of serving the Princesses in the Siege, than in my Embassy; For I had understood 'twas Merinzors Power in Media, which hinder'd Moneses from having any, and I had more than a belief, that this favourite, having render'd himself uncapable of becoming so again, you might assume his place; or at least your Right, which I was confident to advance, being employ'd as a publique Minister. I was also but too-certain, the Siege would last longer than the journey, which six dayes after, I began, that time being effluxt in giving me my Commission, with my private and publique Instructions; but because I design'd so short a residence in Media, I took only Twenty Gentlemen, and some Servants to wait on me, and being inform'd on the Confines of this Kingdom, that it was freshly involv'd in a Domestick War, I sent a couple of my Company before the rest, to avoyd Surprizes; These it seem'd saw those two of Surena's, who fearing Mine, began a round Gallop to recover their Copanions, but they were so briskly follow'd, that one of them was overtaken, & so wounded by a Iavelin, that he not only lost the hopes of his safety, but almost of his Life; you will believe when I came up, that I was not a little surpriz'd, when I found this wounded Prisoner was Palurus, who had the same employment under Surena, that his Brother had under Phraates; I concluded by the Servant, that the Master was not far off, & by threatning to torture him if he acquainted me not where his Prince was, and by promising to have a care of his Life, if he did, he told me, how you, Madam, had bin deluded by his Prince, and that you were both but a few furlongs before us. Oh Gods! how was I surpriz'd at this strange intelligence? and how many oathes did I extort from the dying Palurus before I could believe him? but as soon as I did, leaving him to the care of some Peasants which were present, I ran full speed upon the Traces of Surena; two of my Troop I commanded to kill the Charriot-Driver, and to cut the Harness, lest during the fight, I might lose the reward of it; with the rest I charg'd my Enemie, in which, the first that fell was the false Arzimin. You were, Madam, a spectator of the residue of my storie, and so was Artabbanes, who came in when all my Company had kill'd Surena's; & when they had had the honor to sacrifice all their owne Lives, in an employment which rather deserves my Envie, than my Grief. Sillaces (continu'd Symander) having finish'd his discourse, all those which had heard it (and he himself) were of opinion, the fair Parthenissa's deliverance, was replenisht with so many strange conjunctures, that it relish'd more of Providence than Chance, & that this effect of it, was but an earnest of a more sublime and obliging one. I know not whether so pleasing a belief, by having so high an influence on Artabbanes's Minde, had a proportionate one on his Bodie; or whether so long a charming of his Prince, as that was whilst his Princess and his friend were speaking, did qualifie the violence of his feaver; but I know, that after some discourses upon the precedent ones (Parthenissa being retir'd) he found so sensible an amendment, that he not only acquainted us with it, but convinc'd us of it; and from that day, so uninterruptedly recover'd, that when the generous Sillaces was fit to continue his Embassie, my Prince's condition was so promising, that no just apprehension of his Friend, needed any longer to have suspend it; 'Twas therefore that the fair Parthenissa came to Artabbanes's Chamber, he not being able to wait on hir in hirs, where she found already Sillaces, and Zenophon, and though this meeting was to consult upon the managing of their designes, yet I was not excluded, I shal pass over their debates, to acquaint you with their results, which were; That Zenophon, with those Forces he had then rais'd, should no longer protract his advancing, since Tygranes stood so much in need of them; That Sillaces as the Parthian Embassador, should accompany Zenophon to his King, to treat, and conclude on that league, which was so requisite, & necessary, to the ruining of my Prince's Ryvalls both in Empire & Love; that Sillaces should employ all his Power as publique Minister for the restoration of Artabbanes, as being Nephew to his King, which he might the more safely negotiate, since Arsaces had really revok'd his Banishment, whether to increase Surenas Fears, or to silence Parthenissa's; That if he found any inclinations in Tygranes to receive him, he should then, & not otherwise, acquaint him where he was; That Zenophon should depute (during his absence) such a Governor in Arsacia, as was entirely to receive, & obey Artabbanes's comands, & as much to conceal his so doing. The next day after this resolution was assum'd, it was put in a way of being practic'd, Sillaces accompany'd, with Zenophon, whose Troops consisted of near 10000 Horse & Foot, began their March towards Ecbatan, against which Merinzor with 15000 Horse and 25000 Foot was advanc'd, and Campt within sixteen Furlongs of hir Walls, under which the Kings Forces, which were near, 10000 Horse, and as many Foot, were intrencht. The Governor left in Arsacia was call'd Cloriman, and had receiv'd his education even from his Cradle under Zenophon, who having found him replenisht both with Courage, and Iudgement, had given him a large participation both in all his Comands, and Fortunes. This young Gentleman was so assiduous in this duty of his employment, and to Parthenissa & Artabbanes, that they could not but commend Zenophons Iudgement in his Choyce; I must confess, I had done so too, had I not observ'd he was as assiduous in more than his respects to the fair Emilia, but hir carryage was such, that it gave me rather a satisfaction than an All- arm. Artabbanes, soon after his being left alone with Parthenissa, never left hir so, at least when he could do it with civilitie; and my Prince could not be more intent in increasing Parthenissa's affection, than I was in obtaining Emilia's; so that all that time my generous Master employ'd in his Loves, I did in mine: but whether it were a punishment for having so long contemn'd the power of a God, of which I then was sufficiently convinc'd, or whether it were the fair Emilia's disposition, to behold the effects of hir owne Power, which could not be more vissible, than in continuing my Passion without any demonstration of hir; for above three Moons, though I could not obey my Reason, I found more than I had thitherto known, for my detesting of Love, & though at last I receiv'd the felicitie of an assurance from the object of my Flame, that she approv'd of, and would reward it, yet it was accompany'd with the misfortune that I deriv'd that declaration from Parthenissa, and Artabbanes's prayers, as much as from my owne; yet the belief I had, that Emilia's Iudgement, not want of affection, made hir elect to oblige Three sooner than one, gave me a satisfaction which hir words had deny'd me; but my Prince, who had alreadie obtain'd the victorie over those tedious formallities, now happily pretended to a more transcendent one, by successfully imploring from his Princess, in an Hymeneall Crown, to give his Passion the lowest, and highest satisfaction it could ambition: But as Emilias grant was accompany'd with a qualification, so was Parthenissa's; for my Prince deriv'd it from his reasons, as well as from hir affection: Those he made use of were, that he could no more repine at the Gods, but at hir, if he were perpetually miserable, since she might hinder his being so, by a Concession of his request, which would not only prove a reparation for his past misfortunes, but a preservative from his future, that then the Gods could neither make his Life short, nor unhappie, since the excellencie of the felicities would repair their want of duration; that hir concession would put a period to his externall, as well as intrinsecall sufferings; for though his Ryvalls might have some hopes to conquer hir Constancie, yet they could have none to doe so to hir virtue. Here the fair Parthenissa interrupted him, by saying; Take heed Artabbanes, lest what you imagine will silence the fury of your Enemyes, doe not render it more fatall; for when they finde you are from but a probable obstacle, become a certaine one, they will no more scruple to take away your Life, than I will to take away my own, after such a loss. Madam (said my Prince) you may banish those apprehensions, for you have by pardoning my crimminall jealousies, so abundantly evidenc'd the Immutability of that esteem you honor me with all, that when to that, you shall ad a religious obligation, the known Truth that thereby we can have but one destiny, will make them have the same care of mine, which they will have of yours; so that Madam, to secure me from danger as well as unhappiness, what I now implore at your Feet, is absolutely necessary. Parthenissa, more satisfy'd with his Arguments, than his motion (though she esteem'd it not fit to mingle felicities with fears, nor to be in the embraces of hir Prince, whilst those who had bin hir Companions in hir sufferings, could not be so in hir joyes) yet at length she yeelded to it; that hir Artabbanes might not say, she deny'd him any thing with reason. Oh Gods! (continu'd Symander) it is impossible I should tell you my Prince's transports, how often he prostrated himself before hir, how many thousand times he embrac'd hir knees and kist hir hands; 'Tis sufficient I assure you, his joy was proportionate to what created it; & that it was impossible the sence could relish those felicities, his Minde did; He blest a Milion of times the privacy of their then condition, which admitted no other preparative but a Priest, lest the celebration of the Nuptiall solemnities, might have so long protracted the celebration of the Nuptiall delights; Artabbanes, after he had by innumerable testimonies of his satisfaction, convinc'd Parthenissa of it, retir'd to his Appartment, whither immediatly he sent for Cloriman, whom he acquainted with his joyes, and of whom, he desir'd a Priest against the next day, to put him in the way of consummating them. Cloriman, by an erection of his Eyes, and hands, seem'd to participate in my Prince's satisfaction, which yet he somewhat clouded, by telling him, there was never a Priest in Arsacia, to whose fidelitie he durst trust so important a secret; but that within two dayes he would procure one, for whose secrecie he would answer. Artabbanes was so transported with his desires, that he not only esteem'd the Trusting of any Priest could not prove so high a prejudice, as a dayes protraction would amount unto; But even would have sent for any one, and have venter'd on his fidelitie, had not both Cloriman, and I, by many allegations, disswaded him from it. But at length, those two dayes expir'd, which he continually spent in Parthenissa's company, earnestly offering the Gods as many years of his Life, for the cutting off those two dayes. The Night of the last he spent in as little sleep, as he would have done the succeeding one, and as he did the succeeding one, during one half of which, he was kept waking by his desires, and the other by his fears, and danger; for some Three hours before day, he heard all the Citie in an high Allarm, which made him immediately dress and arm himself to go, and learn the danger, or prevent it; but as he was running to his Princess's Appartment, which his Love, and fear made him resolve to defend, and made him resolve was the place would most need his Defence, he heard the Palace Gates forc'd open, and by that time he was come to the top of those great stairs which lead to the fair Parthenissa's Chamber, he saw a Company of Arm'd Men, which were hastily ascending them; he was not near so much astonish'd thereat, as to see at the head of them the perfidious Cloriman, who lifting up his Helmet, told my Prince, 'Tis not my Treacherie Artabbanes, but my Love, has forc'd me to undertake what I should condemn on any other score; The fair Emilia was not content to scorn my Passion, but to receive Symander's, and even to confer hirs on him; I had the heart to do any thing rather than to see this, and my despair only has made me listen to Merinzor and Surena's solicitations, with whom I have agreed to deliver up this City, and from whom I have received a solemne engagement, that I shall have the fair Emilia, and that your Life shall run no hazard, unless by your own resistance you cause it. Traitor (said my Prince) my life has not bin so bred up in Crimes, that whilst it has a sword to defend it, it should derive its preservation from Infidelitie. No, I had rather lose it to punish thy sin, than live by it, and either by thy death, and Surena's, I will hinder both your Designes, or by my own, your Triumphs. My Prince's blowes began where his words ended, and finding my self oblig'd, both by dutie, affection, and revenge to become Artabbanes's second, I assum'd that noble employment, and being assisted with some of Zenophons Domesticks, we soon drove before us into the Court, those which were come to assault us in the Palace. 'Twas in this retreat, that the false Cloriman had the honor to fall by a hand, which rather rewarded than punish'd his infidelitie. In my Life I never envy'd any of my Prince's actions but this, for I esteem'd it but just, that being the Author of Clorimans Crime, I should have bin of his punishment. Never did Artabbanes purchase more Glory by his personall Courage, than in this fatall Night; and never the Sunne beheld so admirable a sight, as then he lost, in not seeing the prodigious effects of it. The name of Surena, and the apprehensions he should again ravish from him the fair Parthenissa, made him act things, which if Surena had seen, he could not but have as much admir'd, as fear'd. The place where my generous Master and his little Troop, had alreadie made that of his Enemies lesse, was under Parthenissa's window, which soon after was hastily open'd by Emilia, who cry'd out, they were forcing the Princess's Apartment. Artabbanes had scarcely heard that voice, when he flew from a victorie, to a fresh danger, with more celeritie than the greatest Courages could to the former, or the greatest fears from the latter; I follow'd him as fast as my feet could carry me, and yet before I could overtake him, he had engag'd himself in Parthenissa's out-Chamber, amongst as many Enemies, as he had alreadie kill'd. All the service I could doe him, was, by defending the Door, to hinder their increase, which I did as long as I could use my sword; but I lost that and my sences together; yet to hinder that with my Bodie, which I could not with my strength, I fell cross the Door, and there lay as some little impediment. In the mean while Parthenissa hearing a strange noyse at hir Door, every moment expected when it would be broke open, and having a while fruitlessly attended that misfortune, she began to apprehend she was freed from it by a greater; hir fears gave hir no time to consult hir safety, so that immediately opening it, she discover'd they were but too-too-well grounded; For alas my Prince, who thitherto defended it, had receiv'd so many wounds, & lost so much bloud, that he was constrain'd to lean his back against it, so that missing his support, he fell backwards into the Princess's Chamber, weltring in a Sea of bloud: Parthenissa lost not hir judgement, though she did almost hir hopes, at so fatall an object, for in the twinckling of an Eye, she thrust to the Chamber Door, which by good fortune, having a spring lock, was as soo lockt as shut; our Enemies admir'd that their advantage was so soon turn'd to Artabbanes's; but Parthenissa, who apprehended they would immediately force so weak an impediment, conjur'd Artabbanes to permit hir to lead him down a back stairs, which at least would preserve his Life from the fury of those, whom he had so extreamly incenst, 'till the arrivall of some of their Superiors, of whom (as she said) she made no question to obtain it, when she implor'd it with Tears. No Madam (said my Prince somtimes reeling, somtimes leaning on his Sword, and all his Cloaths dropping with bloud) I can but suffer Death by fighting against your Enemies, but I may deserve it by avoyding them; Neither Madam shall you pay to Surena so pretious a ransome as your Tears, for a Life, which by your being in his Power, is far better lost than sav'd: Doe not (fair Parthenissa) deny me the glory of dying at your feet, & for your defence, since 'tis the highest and pleasing'st I can (by your present condition) now aspire unto. My generous Prince spake these few words with as much trouble, as the fair Parthenissa heard them, who so abundantly deplor'd his danger, by this fresh additionall information, that she had lost the very thought of hindring it; neither indeed could she have done it, for the weak Door was instantly broken, and above a dozen arm'd Men came to robb Artabbanes of a Life, that he then was but too-desirous to lose; yet not to die unlike himself, recollecting that little strength he had left, he cast himself on the nearest to him, and with his Ponyard (for he had flung away his Sword, as a weapon his weakness render'd him unable to use) with two or three stabbs, depriv'd him of Life; but my Prince fell with his Enemy, and all the rest taking that advantage, had doubtless acted the revenge of their Companions, if the generous Parthenissa (by flinging hir self on Artabbanes's body) had not become his Armour, and preserv'd him, when he was no longer able to preserve himself; for as the Gods would have it, Surena had given such universall, & strict order for their respecting of Parthenissa, that his Souldiers could not be more carefull of hir, than she had render'd it impossible (they being so) that my Prince should receive any farther harm; for she so cover'd his Body with hirs, that thereby she had render'd their Fates as inseparable, as their affections; but one of Surena's Souldiers more intent upon Revenge, than obedience, threatn'd the Princess, that if any longer she became his Sanctuary, she should be so far from hindering his Fate, that she should share in it. Parthenissa with a disdainfull look, told him, what he said, was rather an invitation to prosecute, than to desist from what she had begun; And though so generous a reply should have rather created the barbarous Souldiers admiration, than rage; yet it did the latter, for he began so uncarefully to thrust at my Prince, that Parthenissa had then no more hopes, but to dye with him. The fair Emilia mov'd with so horrid a proceeding, & with hir Princess's skreeks, immediatly, as if Artabbanes's Soule (which all this while seem'd to have abandon'd his Body) were flown into hirs, took up his Sword, and guided by a divine influence, past it through that Monster; yet the thrust was not so mortall, but that he had strength enough left to doe more mischief, than, if Parthenissa, Artabbanes, and Emilia had bin out of his power, he could have done in all the world besides; & doubtless had effected it, if a Gentleman all cover'd with Arms, and bloud, had not come running into the Chamber, & made an end of that Monster, who otherwise had made an end of Perfections, which even in degrees equall'd his Crimes. All those that were present, knew him by his Armour to be Surena, and Parthenissa did so, as soon as he had lifted up his Helmet, which he did, to let hir know who 'twas, that prostrate at hir feet, begg'd hir Pardon for his Souldiers horrid insolencie, whose Sins he could not be thought guiltie of, since he had so signally punish'd them. Parthenissa, who 'till then had esteem'd Surena's Passion as great a misfortune, as he had the unsuccessfulness of it, now began to hope, that the Gods would repair the injuries it had done hir, by making of it save a Life, which it had so often endanger'd; and the sooner to trie hir power in so ambition'd an essay, she implor'd from Surena a Life which she more apprehended was not in his power to grant, than in his will. Surena with much humilitie protested, he was come to receive hir Commands, not hir intreaties, and to evidence he would never decline any of them, he would not that; which by how much she did appear concern'd in it, by so much did the desert of his obedience do so. The Princess having not only receiv'd his promise, but his protestation of his Concession, rise from that Posture, which did not preserve Artabbanes from more wounds, than it did give Surena; which he endeavour'd to conceal, lest the greatness of his Merit, might have made Parthenissa question, the reallitie of it; so that with a Countenance which relish'd more of trouble for his Rivals present condition, than that he was going to improve, and mend it, leaving the Princess weeping on hir knees by Artabbanes's bodie, he ran, and call'd his owne Chyrurgion, and in hir hearing commanded him (the first thing he did) to dress my Prince's wounds, and with the same care, as if they had bin his: But alas, that order was suddenly chang'd by Surena's perceiving some bloud dropping down Parthenissa's Arm, which proceeded from a slight hurt she had receiv'd, in the shoulder, descending Artabbanes. Oh Gods! what did not Surena say, when he saw that pretious bloud spilt by one, which had bin under his comand? he caus'd that dead Traitor immediately to be carry'd out, and hung in Chains in the Allarm-place, and by presenting his Sword to Parthenissa, implor'd, & gave hir the power to shed all his, as an expiation. But she, (more concern'd in Artabbanes's than all things else) only enjoyn'd Surena the Penance, that his Rivalls wounds, might be drest before hirs; which she assur'd him did not so much trouble hir, as he seem'd to be troubl'd at it; Parthenissa could not have impos'd a more severe Penance on Surena, & doubtless he had not submitted to it, if it had bin unaccompany'd with that assurance; besides, imagining she would not expose such beauties to his sight, as were to be the reward of the Chyrurgions Art, he hastily caus'd his Ryvall to be drest in the Princess's bed, which he appologiz'd for, by beseeching hir to remove unto another Appartment, & out of so much bloud and confusion. Parthenissa neither heard his excuse, or desires; for the Chyrurgions, by giving Artabbanes strong Cordialls, by stopping his bloud, and by binding up his wounds, made him by some deep groans, testifie he was not dead. Never was any of his Addresses, or professions, so pleasing to that fair Princess as were those groans; and never could she have believ'd 'till then, that the Cods themselves could have made hir take so much delight in Artabbanes's; whose recoverie the Chyrurgions assur'd hir would be infinitly prejudic'd (if not worse) if he were in so weak a condition any way disturb'd. Parthenissa therefore begging, and obtaining from Surena, that hir Appartment might be the next to my Prince's, continu'd immovable by him, expecting 'till it were made readie, and 'till he should give some fresh and more pregnant testimonies, of a Life, she could not be more joy'd to recover, than if it were fled, she was resolv'd to follow. fair Emilia stole from hir to do the like on me, and found I was not far from the place in which my strength had so injuriously abandon'd me; For Surena's Souldiers by believing I had lost my Life, took it not away, but contented themselves only with dragging me from that place in which I had proved some little impediment to them. There 'twas that Emilia perceiv'd me; and though it were in so forlorn a condition, yet it was in as good a one, as I could have ambition'd, since it equall'd my Prince's; for whom my concerns were more transcendent, than for my Passion: Emilia by a faint beating of my Heart, discover'd some hopes of Life, at which she assum'd as sublime a satisfaction, as mine would have bin, had I bin capable of seeing hirs; which receiv'd no small accession by the accidentall passing by of one of hir Fathers Domesticks, whom she knew to be a Chyrurgion of as much Fidelitie, as Art,  & who perhaps had deriv'd his own preservation, from the Enemies knowledge of the latter. To his care the fair Emilia committed me, but in terms so pressing, that he found my recoverie no indifferent thing unto hir. With both their helps I was carried to a Chamber contiguous to hirs, where, whilst those Cordials I had receiv'd were operating, she return'd to Parthenissa, who she found in the continuance of a Charitie as perfect, as either hir that conferr'd, or he that receiv'd it. She had longer engag'd hir self in that employment, had not the Chyrurgions protested to hir it was a fruitless one; and that as soon as ever Artabbanes was in a condition to know, or receive the honor she did him, they would bring hir advice of it. Parthenissa having had a reiterated assurance of of this engagement from those who had made it, immediately went to hir Appartment, which was joyning to my Prince's, and was waited on thither by Surena, who more concern'd in hir recoverie than hir Companie, to evince that Truth, immediately retir'd hir self into an out-Chamber, from whence he sent in the Chyrurgions to dress a Hurt, which though slight to hir that had receiv'd it, was almost mortall unto two that had not. As soon as they had perform'd their Dutie, Surena came in to perform his, which he did in these terms; If, Madam, the greatness of the Crime of shedding your bloud, does not sufficiently illustrate I am innocent of it, I doe protest before all the Gods, that had I known my unfortunate Flame, should have had so unfortunate a way of recovering you out of my Ryvalls Power, I had rather eternally have bin deny'd that felicitie, than purchas'd it at so criminall a rate: Yes Madam, my respect, and my Passion know nothing superior to them, but the Beautie to which I pay the former, and which does inspire the latter; whose perfections are such, that they necessitate me to things which would be unpardonable, had they a lesser attraction; but my Sins have so ample a one, that none (except you and your Artabbanes) but by seeing the cause of them, will rather commend than excuse their effects; I speak not this Madam, to invite you by reason to pardon my unhappie performance, I had much rather receive mine from you, than from your justice, that what invites your Mercy, may prove a more transcendent blessing, than your Mercy it self. I should be (said Parthenissa) too-unjust, did I esteem you guiltie of a Crime which you have so exemplarily punish'd; but I must tell you, had you bin innocent of all others, you could not have suspected your self guiltie of this, nor bin necessitated to protestations, of whose reallity you have yet a more perswasive way to create my belief; For if (as your vowes would perswade me) your concerns are more for me, than your self, you may obligingly evince it, by restoring both Artabbanes and me to a Freedom, which will make us much more yours, than your force has done or can doe; and create those resentments in me, which nothing but such a performance, is capable to inspire. Oh Gods! (said Surena, lifting up his Eyes to Heaven) you cannot (Madam) be henceforth offended at my Passion, when in spight of your Modestie, you confess you believe the power your perfections give you over me, to be infinite, by making such a Motion: Alas Madam, was it not enough that you made me save my Ryvall's life, but that you must command me to render my self almost as miserable, as I make him happy? For to give away my hopes of the fair Parthenissa, is almost to be curs'd as much, as to possess hir, is to be blest. I tell you this Madam, that you may forgive my justifiable disobedience, nothing but such a comand could make me give it such a name, & I cannot but esteem my self excusable, if having so truly profes'd an uimitable Passion for you, I decline an obedience, which would but too-fatally bring that truth in question; Do not Madam, I beseech you, invite me to gain your favour, by what will make me eternally lose the hopes of it, nor condemn a disobedience, in which you may discover a Flame, greater than the Sin which discloses it. If (said Parthenissa) I had that high opinion of my self, that you would infer my request seems to import, I should not then have made it, but the little invitation you have to continue an ill-plac'd Affection, both for the Choice and the Success, and the great propensitie you have to generous things, made me believe, by representing to you the latter, I might diswade you from the former, and in one performance invite you to act, both according to the Dictates of reason, and Gallantrie. The first of these Madam (said Surena) I cannot more indisputably do, than in continuing my adoration for the fair Parthenissa; and the last it may be I have alreadie done, in giving a Life to hir satisfaction, which has depriv'd me of any. But Surena, who took as little delight in these requests, as Parthenissa did in the condition, which render'd hir making them necessarie, immediately withdrew himself, and he was scarcely gone, when one of Artabbanes's Chyrurgions came running into hir Chamber, to let hir know, that his Senses being restor'd, to indear his Patients preservation, he had told him, from whom, and how he deriv'd it; but that had bin so far from producing the expected effect, that it had done the Contrary, for immediatly after the Information, he had imploy'd that little strength he had left, to the tearing off his Plaisters, and to the acting of such extravagancies, that his Companions had bin, and were necessitated to hold his Arms by force, 'till he were run to implore hir to do it, by hir commands. Parthenissa had hardly the leasure to hear so fatall an information, for hir sudden running to my Prince's Chamber, whom alas she still found violently held by the Chyrurgions & their Servants. Great Gods! (continu'd Symander) what did not that fair Princess doe at so sad a spectacle? she could not see hir generous Servant all pale and bloudie, and with looks as full of horror as his Thoughts, but she melted into Tears, and kneeling by his Beds side, she told him; Is Parthenissa then become so odious to Artabbanes, that rather than not become hir Murtherer, he will become his owne? have the Gods bin so miraculously your preservers, to make you become as miraculously your owne Destroyer? Have I endanger'd my life to save yours, and is this the return you make me? are we not miserable enough by our Destinies, but we must make our selves more by our Despair? Cruel Artabbanes, if Death only can give us ease, was there ever any such disproportion in our Iudgements, as should induce you now to believe a disproportionate Fate, shall create a resembling satisfaction; or do you detest my Constancie, that you take so sudden and fatall a Course to avoid beholding it? Great Gods! (she continu'd raising hir voice and hir hands) if alreadie my afflictions have not evidenc'd my fidelitie, give me Tryalls of it as great as it self, and let the residue of my Life be spent in such sufferings, as may manifest that immutability, which it seems my past ones could not. My Prince (said Symander) more wounded with these words, than he was with his Enemies swords, having first obtain'd from Parthenissa that she would sit upon his Bed, with as many Sighes, as words, told hir; It is time my Princess, it is now time, if it had not bin before, to act what you are come to interrupt: Can I live but in a higher Crime than to become my own Murtherer, after you interpret a production of my Flame, & Care, to be one of my hatred and jealousie? Alas those are both equall and impossible Sins; that I can hate the fair Parthenissa is so egregious a misbelief, that but to Name, is to confute it; and to doubt hir Constancy, is to doubt what by a sad, and happy experiment, I have found is as transcendent in perfection, as to suspect it, is the contrary in an opposite extream. No Madam, what I was doing proceeded absolutly from my love to my Princess, and from my knowledge of hir Constancy; The first of these, made me esteem it both just, and rationall to set a period to an unfortunate Life, which experimentally I found, had hitherto render'd hirs so; & the last, made me esteem it as lust, & Rationall, since hir Constancy (by what she had so often & so recently perform'd) would confine hir to a Fate, which the Gods had confin'd to eternall misfortunes, to cut off the cause of their Cruelty, and leave them thereby as little excuse for the continuation of it, as while she so infinitly misplaces the blessing of hir affection, she affords them too-much. In brief Madam, I was practiceing but what you approv'd in Surena, for I was but taking away a Life, that had indanger'd yours, which is so great a Duty, that without a proportionate Injustice you cannot hinder it. Are you then Artabbanes (the Princess reply'd) so ignorant of my affection, as to believe I can survive the object of it? the Gods by what they doe, but indanger our Lives, but you by what you designe, will inevitably end them; can an evincement that I love you more, induce you to love me, & your self the less; we are not miserable enough to despair, when we can make our selves more so; & what you so fatally designe will abundantly doe it; The Gods as they have hitherto to try'd our Constancyes, will in the future reward them, if what you intend prevent it not: Doe not therefore my Artabbanes doubly injure them, by doubting of their Mercy, and by hindering them to act it; I doe not tell you this, that I decline bearing you company, no, I am ready to do it; By killing your self, you cannot more certainly go before me to another life, than I will the same moment follow you; neither can you suspect, that she who has bin your Companion in the sufferings of virtue, will decline being so, when you go to receive the reward of it. I should never finish my Relation (said Symander) did I particularize all their discourses, I will therefore only tell you their result, which was, that after many reasons, Parthenissa's prevail'd; but then my Prince's retributions had almost proved as fatall, as his Despair, for forcing himself to make them in a posture fitting their condition, not his, a great wound he had receiv'd in the side, unfortunatly open'd, out of which there issued such a flux of bloud, that the Chyrurgions could not be more troubl'd at it, than they were to stop it; and, one of the remedyes they prescrib'd for that end, was, that Parthenissa should leave the Chamber, which she obey'd, after she had received many reiterated protestations, that Artabbanes did leave off all violent designes against his own Life, and consequently against hirs. I will not (continu'd Symander) any longer usurp upon your patiences, which I fear my just concerns in every particular action of my Prince's, has already made me do too-much: You shall therefore only know, that my wounds by the fair Emilias care were recover'd before my Prince's, whereby I was free'd (by being enabl'd to wait on him) from a greater trouble than they themselves had bin. Surena not only knew what belong'd to a Gentleman, but practic'd it by a constant visiting of Artabbanes, and by demonstrating as much care in his recovery, as if it had bin to have restor'd him to hopes, and not to have depriv'd him of them. And truly, except his Crimes in Love, I never knew him guilty of any, nor never act what was unworthy the noble Title of Zephalinda's Brother, but in his Flame, he was as cryminall as unsuccessfull, though his Partizans alleaged, that only therein being so, it was not his Nature, but Passion which offended. During my Prince's danger, Surena permited Parthenissa unrestrainedly to visit him, either out of Civilitie, or Revenge; the first, that he might be deny'd nothing conducive to his health, and the last, that she might see that he wanted it; but as soon as that was restor'd, he lost a conversation which made him think it a misfortune; but this was so handsomely carry'd, that it was only in Surena's absence, who went to the Frontiers to receive his Brother, and his Armie; and perhaps he elected that course, to induce parthenissa to wish for his return; as also in his absence to hinder an union which had so narrowly bin interrupted. The fair Emilia, and I, were the constant Embassadors between the generous Lovers, and by the excellent example of their Passion, learn'd to form our owne. Surena having met Vixores, sent him, and his Forces to joyn with Merinzor, but being himself more concern'd in Love, than Glory, return'd to Arsacia, where he receiv'd the intelligence, that Tygranes (before Sillaces and Zenophon were joyn'd with him) being impatient at Merinzor's, in some manner besieging him, had put his Fate to a Battell which he had lost, and with exceeding difficultie recover'd the walls of Ecbatan, under which it had bin fought; that when the King was reduc'd to the last extremitie, the Parthian Embassador, with 5000 of Zenophon's Armie, had forc'd the Guards of the Camp, and flung himself into the Citie, which he despair'd not to defend, 'till Zenophon, who with the residue of his Armie was retreated to Chrisapolis, could so recruit it, as to bring the Destinie of Media to a second Field. Surena acquainted the Princess with this intelligence, but so unconcernedly, as if the dissatisfaction it brought hir, supprest the contentment it afforded him. But as soon as Parthenissa had desir'd the permission of visiting Artabbanes, which during his absence had bin deny'd hir, he not only waited on hir to his Chamber, but sent for the Governor thither, whom he reprehended for his incivilitie, and punish'd also, by discharging him from the Government of Arsacia, which made many believe, their separation had bin his fault, not Surena's; though at least as many concluded, Surena practic'd the common Art among Princes, of disgracing Servants for committing of obliging (and sometimes commanded) offences. That too, which almost turn'd this belief into a certaintie, was, that he was sent to a command, which was rather a preferment than a Punishment; and Surena never permitted the Lovers to converse but in his presence, yet so artificially, that none which had not bin exceedingly concern'd in it, could have taken notice of it. One Evening, when Surena was in Parthenissa's Chamber, there came into it a Gentleman of Merinzor's, who presented him a Letter from his Prince, which he read with often starting, and change of colour, and which he had not sooner perused, than he presented it to Parthenissa, who found in it these words;  mine; and that you may enjoy with felicitie what I shall with Envie, I have given one the charge of his Execution, who you shall not be acquainted with, but after he has done you an obligation you have hitherto declin'd conferring on your self, though I am confident you disrelish'd nothing in the performance, but that you were to act it.  As soon as the fair Parthenissa had receiv'd this fatall Letter, he that brought it, and was the Person mention'd in it, went out of hir Chamber into Artabbanes's, who he found all alone, and in so deep a Melancholly, that he was almost desiring that Death, the other was come to give him: My Prince, who thought him some Gentleman sent from Surena to visit him, risse from the place he sat on, and went to salute him; but the other, first locking the Door, drew his sword, and having told him, he was come to revenge his Brothers Death or to follow him, ran with it at Artabbanes, who by the resemblance this Traytor had to him he had kill'd in Parthenissa's Chamber, concluded, and that truly, 'twas him he meant. But this as unexpected as dangerous an adventure, which would have disturbed a less Resolution than my generous Master's, raised his, for stepping two or three Paces back, he put by as many thrusts, and snatching up the Chair he had sat on, made use of that as a shield; the noyse which this scuffle made, was so great, that it was easily heard in Parthenissa's Chamber, which was contiguous to my Prince's, and observing that he which had brought the Letter was gone out of it, and suspecting the noyse she heard proceeded from the cause it did, and which she so much apprehended, immediately with the wings of fear, and Love, she flew towards the scene where this Tragedie was acting, and Surena after hir; but finding the Door lockt, the Princess cry'd out, Will you then Surena permit Artabbanes to be murther'd? you shall derive no advantage from it, for I attest those Gods (who cannot be so, if they punish not this Sin) what ever be my Artabbanes's fate, I will make it mine; Surena heard not these words, for he was then running against the Door, which he did so violently, and successfully, that he broke it open, just as Artabbanes was so tyr'd with his unweldie shield, that his weakness was giving his Enemie an advantage, which his courage would never have conferr'd on him, Surena with his naked sword, and by a great Crie, made the Traytor turn about, who finding by his new Adversaries Posture, his Designe, resolv'd to prevent it, and by a furious thrust, past his sword through Surena's bodie, but not offending any of the noble parts, he had strength enough left, not only to interpose himself between Artabbanes (who was fallen down)  & his Enemie, but by a happy thrust, to deprive the latter of his Life. I cannot (said Symander) sufficiently exalt this generous performance, for it was as much above description, as expectation, and almost equally divided Parthenissa's Tears, & Charitie between the generous Ryvalls, who both by their wounds, lay weltering in a sea of bloud at hir feet: But the Princess, who fear'd there might be more in the Conspiracie, believing she might defer hir gratitude to act hir Care, and thought the latter somewhat exprest the former, ran out to call for assistance; The first she met was Emilia, and I, who had bin walking in the Palace. Gallaries, in a conversation almost as pleasing as the action she told us of Surena's was generous. Emilia instantly ran to call the Chyrurgions, and the Princess and I, to see what we could doe in their absence; we found Surena in a deep swound, and my Prince on his knees by him, neglecting his owne danger, and stopping with his hand, the orifice of that wound, which had cast his Ryvall into that condition, and which had hinder'd my Prince from being in no worse a one; Doubtless this Gallantrie was the more so, by being conferr'd on one insensible of it, and who could hardly repine at his being in so dangerous a condition, since it evidenc'd how pretious his Life was to the most accomplisht of Men. Parthenissa, in expectation of the Chyrurgions arrivall, tore all the Linen she wore, and had the strength to tear, with which she somewhat stopt the generous Ryvalls bleeding, in a confidence, that what was Artabbanes's designe, could not be his trouble; neither indeed was it, for the first thing for which she had his retribution, was, for hir Care of Surena; who suddenly after Emilia's and the Chyrurgions coming, was carry'd on Artabbanes's bed, who would not permit his owne wounds to be touch'd, 'till Surena's were drest, & then having more strength than he, by the help of some servants, he exchang'd their Appartments. Surena (as I have said) having none of his vitalls offended, gave his Chyrurgions no other trouble than to stop an internall bleeding, who being perfect in their Art, they successfully did it; 'Twas then they acquainted him with my Prince's care in stoping his wound, and protested to him, 'twas from thence he deriv'd his Life, and that if Artabbanes's ran any hazard of his owne, it would proceed from his not having done that to himself, which he had done to him. Surena magnify'd my Prince's gallantrie in such pressing terms, that all those which heard him, were convinc'd, 'twas as much his Truth, as his Civilitie which spake; and having learn'd he had resign'd his Appartment to him, he was almost as much troubled at it, as at the cause of it, and sent to implore his pardon for a fault, he had permited and not acted. Neither did Surena's care extend to the formall, but even to the essentiall parts of it, for out of an apprehension, Merinzor might perform what he had but attempted, he commanded his Guard of an hundred Partizans, to become my Prince's, and each of them to answer his Life with their owne. It is almost impossible (continu'd Symander) to tell you how equally Parthenissa divided hir visits, and how proportionately gratitude, and affection govern'd hir; but it is absolutely so, to express with how much satisfaction Artabbanes observ'd it, and perhaps as much so, for any which knew him not, to believe it. Some three or four dayes after this accident, Parthenissa (as she usually did) went to visit Surena, who the Physitians protested might then speak to hir with less prejudice, than his silence would bring him. 'Twas then after some other usuall Civilities, and that Parthenissa began to deplore his condition, that he told hir; The Gods (Madam) which knew how fit it was you should know the transcendencie of my Passion, and how unfit it was you should know it by that fatall way in which you desir'd to be convinc'd of it, have (I hope) so demonstrated that Truth, that you can no longer doubt it; which consequently I shall never deplore, since 'twas a manifestation I would not only have purchas'd with the hazard of my Life, but even with the loss of it, had not that loss carry'd with it a greater; and knowing Madam, that you are perfect in all your attributes, I cannot doubt, but the highest Passion, may aspire to the highest reward, and that mine is so, cannot be a greater certaintie, than your not believing it so is an injustice. Parthenissa, who expected reproches instead of requests, listen'd to the latter with satisfaction, and indeed it was the less troublesome of the two, for it is so, to have requests made, than to make them; Hir criminall suspitions of Surena's being accessarie to, or at least permitting Artabbanes's intended Murther, merited a higher penance than she then suffer'd, and concluding it better not to discover hir offence, than to obtain a forgiveness for it, she elected the first of these, and therefore only answer'd him; That the generous Surena has as infinitly oblig'd me, as he has his Ryvall, cannot be a more indisputable Truth, than that the strange way, in which he has preserv'd Artabbanes for Parthenissa, is an evidence how much the Gods are concern'd in his being so preserv'd; so that there wants in the obligation to render it perfect, but that you will make the same construction, of the same performance. Oh Gods (said Surena) it is high time to despair, when even those very arguments which evince the height, and purenese of my flame, are perverted to inferences, that I should extinguish it, or resigne my hopes to him that has not so legitimate ones. Parthenissa, who perceiv'd by this reply, that she had touch'd him in a place he was more sensible of, than of his wounds, began in hir subsequent discourses, to give him hir resolutions in such terms, that though Surena evidently read hir intentions, yet he could hardly quarrell at those expressions which acquainted him with them. Whilst affairs were in this condition in Arsacia, those in Ecbatan were strangely alter'd, since Syllaces had cast himself into it; that generous Prince by his Courage, & Conducts, so rais'd the Defendant's resolutions, that their Fears of preserving the place, were much less than Merinzor's of not obtaining it; neither was this the only productions of his virtue, for by the unintermitted, and visible effects of it, he had wone such an Ascendent over the King of Media's inclinations, that neither the affection he had given Merinzor, nor the present hatred he payd him, could in degrees either equall the esteem or Friendship he had so justly contracted for my Prince's Friend; who so well improv'd this acquisition, that he had no ungrounded hopes to render Artabbanes at least an equall sharer in this good fortune. And though Merinzor who had learn'd from whence so successfull a resistance proceeded, did alleadge, that Syllaces, by taking up Arms, had violated and infringed the dutie of an Embassador; yet it hinder'd not Syllaces from proceeding in what he had so far advanc'd, but induced him to offer Merinzor the Combate for the clearing this aspersion, which he declining, his allegation was answered by a large Manifest, whose effect was; That being imploy'd from his King, to negotiate a League for the mutuall destruction of their Rebels, he did nothing against his Commission or employment, if he contributed to what he came to treat of. But at length, all the joy of his frequent successes were extinguish'd in the fatall newes of Surena's surprizing Arsacia, which was brought him by a Spye he had sent into the Enemies Camp, who only could assure him of that misfortune, but not of any particulars which succeeded it; Syllaces to make his Enemies wear his Liverie, by Tygranes consent, drew out all the Forces of Ecbatan, but those which were upon the Guard, and in the dead of Night, made so furious an attempt on Merinzors Camp, that he sent some Thousands to sleep eternally, and doubtless might have rais'd the Siege, with the Garrison, had not an unfortunate Dart given him so dangerous a woud, that his Souldiers converted their care of victorie, into one for him; and the former he himself had so far advanc'd, that the latter, for as much as concern'd his bringing off, was not difficult; he was met at the Gate by the King, who gave to the Danger of his Protector as many Tears, as to his own, by so fatall a deprivation. Syllaces, who (as well as his Physitian) thought himself in the state of Death, desir'd that his Chamber might be emptied of all but Tygranes, of whom he implor'd, that he would confer that high affection he had honor'd him with, on Artabbanes (if living) and Lyndadory, for whose resentments, fidelitie, and esteem of it, he would give his dying breath for securitie, & that if he might receive an assurance of this Concession, he should leave the World with as much satisfaction, as the leaving it in so ill a conjuncture for his affairs, would permit. Tygranes, whom adversitie had set into the wayes of virtue, by the dictates of it, and by being sensibly touch'd by the last request of so generous, and dying Friend, first granted it by Tears, and then by Protestations, which gave Syllaces, a satisfaction his present condition seem'd to be uncapable of; But the Gods had reduced him to this extreamitie, but in order to their acting a double Myracle, that of restoring him to Life, and Moneses's bloud, to Tygranes's favour, and good opinion. I cannot tell whether the joy of that grant contributed to, or acted the former, but I am certain, from the Minute he receiv'd it, as if the bodie had participated in the satisfaction of the Minde, it began to amend; but yet so slowly, that Tygranes had but too-many experiences, that his success, under the Gods, was derived from the generous Syllaces; Neither was the good Fortune of Merinzor's without some Clouds, for as he computed the business, he apprehended before he could reduce Ecbatan to his Power, either Syllaces recoverie, or Zenophon's increasing Armie, would cast him into the same despair which that generous Prince's performances, had involv'd him in alreadie; but when to these apprehensions, the intelligence was brought him, that not only his designe on Artabbanes was destroy'd, but that it was so too, by Surena; he was almost as much troubl'd at the manner, as at the thing; but yet at the arrivall of Vixores, and the Parthian Forces, he began to hope, 'twas out of too-much affection for Parthenissa, and not of too-little for him, that he had saved my Prince, and therefore 'twas, he determin'd no longer to delay an execution which Surena could not well suspend without wronging as much his Ambition, as his owne Love. But whilst Merinzor was employing himself to obtain his designes, Artabbanes and Surena did their Healths, and Emilia by a seeming spye to the last of them, but a reall one to hir Father, had learn'd that Cloriman had only taken those two dayes respit for the sending for a faithfull Priest, but to purchase so much time for his unripe Treacherie. But (continu'd Symander) to hasten my relation, I will no more replenish it with any things but those so essentiall, that you shall be convinc'd, I am as much concern'd in the speedy finishing it, as my hearers can be. It was but half a Moon, after the Ryvalls recoveries, that one day walking in the Palace Gardens, a Captain of the Guards presented Surena with a Packet, which the better to read, leaving Parthenissa with my Prince, he retyr'd himself into another walk, where opening the Letters, he found the first was directed to him from Merinzor, and contained these words:  having so preserv'd one Enemy, you might have rais'd your self another, and it may be as dangerous a one as him you protected; Neither could I but conclude, if I consulted with reason, not Friendship, that I have a very considerable share in yours, since to confer on me the highest disobligation you are capable of, you use your self at that rate. Do not, I conjure you, break with your Friend, to preserve your Enemie, nor evidence how little I may expect from you, when to the obliging me, I only desire you to sit still, and cannot obtain it: I have sent those who will infallibly secure and revenge us, if by way of reparation, for having hither to hinder'd it, you do not undertake it your self; I hope you will not by neither acting, nor permitting this, give me so much reason to be your Enemie, that I must finde a Misfortune in the too- much Iustice of becoming so.  Surena having read this high Letter, open'd the other, and though it were without address or name, yet by some private mark, he was not ignorant that it came from Merinzor's Secretarie, whom he had corrupted both by large Gifts and hopes; it contained these words?  indeed can you under take to defend the latter from Death, but you will more than hazard participating in his Fate, by endeavouring to hinder it; for there are so many engaged in the Designe, that your desire of preventing it cannot be greater, than the impossibilitie: believe it Sir as a certain truth, that the first attempt you make for your Ryvalls defence, will be your last, and that he which is Merinzor's Enemie, and he which endeavours to hinder his destruction, will be consider'd under one notion.  Parthenissa, and Artabbanes (who concluded by Surena's leaving them alone, that what invited him to so unusuall an action, had an unusuall motive) did not walk away from the place he had left them in, but from thence had fixtly consider'd his actions, and gestures, as things in which they might discover his thoughts, which they found were very perplex'd, for having ended his two Letters, he walk'd three or four turns, then read them over again,  & after the third time he had done the same, pulling down his Hat over his Eyes, and folding his Arms one within the other, he continu'd with as little outward disquiet, as the inward was great. At length, after an hour so spent, he came again to the Princess and his Ryvall, and to the first of them presented his letters, telling hir withall, by whom the last was written, & that he had sent it in his Prince's Packet, as the least hazardous conveyance. Parthenissa whilst she was reading, both in hir looks and gesture, exprest no small disorder, and Surena as soon as she had ended, having receiv'd his Papers, saluted hir with as much humilitie, as sadness; and then went to the Garden Door, where his Guards expected him, and where he commanded their Captain immediately to seize upon Artabbanes, to carry him close prisoner to the Castle, & to keep him there in that Qualitie, 'till he received further orders; Surena having given him these Commands, went immediately to the Cittadell, whither he remov'd his lodgeings, and from whence he sent two hundred Souldiers to guard the Pallace, and to permit none either to enter into it, or to come out of it, without a Pass under his owne hand. The Captain who had receiv'd direction to make Artabbanes his Prisoner, being a Parthian, and consequently reverencing the high bloud of the Arsacides, came even in tears to do his dutie, and protested, he had much rather have lost his owne Libertie, than become the Instrument of depriving my Prince of his; who judging by Surena's abrupt departure, & by those of the Guards coming towards him, what their intentions were, went to his weeping Princess, and implor'd hir to support hir Faith on the many precedent deliverances the Gods had sent him; that Surena had so dearly purchas'd hir esteem, and so justly valu'd it, that it was improbable he would by any cryminall performance, destroy what was so long a perfecting; especially since his fall herein, would be like a Statesmans, which admits not of a second; He saw in his Looks a reluctancie to his action, and that he was too-much a Gentleman to be guided by considerations opposite to reason, and honor, or for the satisfaction of Merinzor's hopes, to ruine his owne: Artabbanes had further enlarg'd himself in consolations of this Qualitie, had he not perceiv'd, that alreadie Parthenissa's colour began to abandon hir, as hir senses did suddenly after, & by falling in his Arms seem'd to tell him, she expected no consolation but from Death: my Prince that had given hir hopes for his owne condition, could give himself none for hirs, which lasted not long in that extream, for by that time that he, Emilia, & I, had carry'd hir in our Arms to those Stairs which lead to hir Appartment, hir breath, but not hir words, were come to hir again, so that Artabbanes by pressing, and kissing hir hands, took, as we all thought, an eternall leave; and in whispers conjur'd Emilia to hinder hir Princess's despair, from making hir the sharer of his Fate, as she had but too-much bin of his Misfortunes. Emilia neither answer'd, nor indeed heard his request, for all the faculties of hir Soul, had resign'd themselves to grief: My Prince having spoke those few words, with a languishing look, took a second farewell from his Princess (who by being then insensible, was more happie than if she had bin otherwise) and going to the Guard, return'd them thanks for their Civilitie, and desir'd them to do their Dutie. The Captain mov'd with so sad a separation, told him, would to the Gods Sir I durst, for then I should carry you to Libertie, not to Prison: whilst this little discourse past between them, I had represented to Emilia, that 'twas fit I should wait on my Prince, and had obtain'd not only hir permission, but commands to do it. 'Twas therefore that I came to the Captain, and desir'd his leave for it, which he more readily granted, than my Prince, & accompany'd his Civilitie with this Protestation, that nothing which could be conducive to Artabbanes's satisfaction, and which was not positively forbidde him, but should still finde the same return. By this time we were come to the Garden Gate, where we found a Charriot readie, into which my Prince made me follow him; the same Officers, and the same Guard, brought us to the Castle, which is a place as impregnable as Art, and Nature, can render any; the Appartment allotted for my generous Master, was very large, and magnificent, to supply his being deny'd the liberty of the Gardens; and finding he was to be a close Prisoner, he commanded me to get a Pallate, and to lie in his Chamber, where he resign'd himself to so transcendent a grief, that I knew by the greatness of it, 'twas not for himself, but Parthenissa, who Emilia told me afterwards, had assum'd a proportionate sorrow, both for the quantitie, and the Cause. My Prince found nothing in his imprisonment, no not the very end in order to which it was, so intollerable, as the being deny'd the sending to, and hearing from his Princess, who as soon as she had learn'd, she was under a resembling misfortune, concluded Surena's designe was exceeding cryminall, since rather than permit hir to know his actions, he elected to give an exact Lover, the fears such a relation unavoidably inspires, and thereby contract a worse opinion of him, than his very worst performance could almost create. Ten dayes after Artabbanes's imprisonment (during which time, he never saw or spake with any, except the Captain of the Guards and me) finding so long a suspence as bad as execution, he earnestly conjur'd him to learn what Surena's intentions were, and if possibly, what his usage was to Parthenissa. The Captain promised to endeavour both, and about four hours after return'd, but with a Countenance that spake his intelligence, before his words did; which acquainted my Prince, that for the last of his Commands, so strict a watch was kept in the Palace, that thereby all his endeavours therein, had bin fruitless; but as to the first of them, he came into Surena's Chamber, when some of Merinzor's Partizans, were disputing with him, not whether you should be put to Death, but of the way of it; he alleadging, that in regard of your Quality, especially in Media, you ought to have so much respect, as not to be a publick Spectacle on an infamous Scaffold, and that to execute you in your Chamber, would be of as much advantage, less scandalous, and more secure; for (the Captain continu'd) the Inhabitants of this Citie are so great Reverencers of either the Arsacian bloud, or of Moneses's Familie, that Surena has sent for 1000 Parthian Horse out of his Brothers Armie, to keep Arsucia from Tumults, which he apprehends it will fall into, let the execution be never so private; on the other side, Merinzor's servants alleadged, that since you were the first Prince of the Bloud, the execution ought to be publick, that the Medians might be convinc'd of the reallitie of your Death, and thereby cut off their hopes, with your Life; for it has bin no unusuall thing from the obscure Death of Princes, to set up Counterfeits, which have prov'd as dangerous as the reall ones could; that it would look rather like a Murther, than an Execution, were it done in private; and that by so covert a proceeding, it might give the Arsacians an opinion we want either Iustice, or Power; the former will make them believe 'tis honest to relieve him, and the latter, that it is safe. Though (said the Captain) I heard the debate, yet I was commanded to withdraw when they were to form the result; but yet I learn'd that what ever it were, it would not be put in execution 'till the arrivall of the 1000 Parthian Horse, who are hourly expected. Any (continu'd Symander) that had heard this Relation, would have thought he that made it had spoken of himself, not of my Prince, who found more satisfaction in learning his destinie, than trouble in learning 'twas so fatall a one; and doubtless, had not his just apprehensios of the fair Parthenissa's despair, or at least excessive grief, ty'd his hands, he had by one generous stroak, exempted himself from the infamie of dying on a Scaffold, or composing a publick Trophie for his Enemies; but that Parthenissa might be convinc'd his Life was dear to him, since it was to hir, he determin'd, if it were his fortune to be put to Death, not to act it himself, that she might not condemn, but deplore his Fall. To the Captain he gave such eloquent and admirable consolations, that he went away full of satisfaction, but I cannot say whether it proceeded from an assurance, he thereby received of his going into a better world, or that the brightness of his virtues render'd him any longer unfit for this. We had not bin two hours alone, when we heard all the Streets of Arsacia eccho with Trumpets, which we knew proceeded from the arrivall of the Parthian Horse, who were immediately distributed into severall advantagious Posts in the Citie, the better to suppress all disorders. Artabbanes was advertis'd of this by his former Intelligencer, who told him withall, that a Scaffold was erected before the Palace-window, and though some said it was for his execution, and that Parthenissa might be a Witness of it, yet he had bin assur'd in private, the execution should be so, and that the Scaffold being rais'd there, was but the more artificially to delude the People; and that Surena's opinion of doing the business obscurely, had at length bin assented to. My Prince was a little surpriz'd at the first part of this intelligence, not upon his own scoar, but on his Princess's, whose grief, and despair, he apprehended would receive no little accession, by becoming a Witness, or a hearer of his suffering; neither could he in so sad an exigent have told how to have behav'd himself; for if he had dy'd without emotions, as on the one side it had eclips'd his Enemies revenge, so on the other it had done the same to the evincement of his resentments for so sad, and fatall a deprivation; and should he manifest the latter, he could not but have contributed to a satisfaction, the greatness of which would have proportionately created his own trouble; but the Captain's assurance was so probable, that he believ'd it, for though he esteem'd Surena would be vindicative, yet, he could not think he would be barbarously so. The Commander of the Guards knowing how little Time Artabbanes had left, thought it unfit by his Company, to rob him of any part of it, and therefore withdrew himself, but he made me a signe to follow him into the next room, which I did, where he told me, that for certain the following Night was destin'd for my Prince's Death, and that he had declin'd acquainting him with it himself, as believing it an information fitter for my discovering; I had only words enough to thank his care, for my grief stifl'd the rest in the very birth. My generous Master at my return into the Chamber, knew some new Misfortune was come to my knowledge, and constrain'd me, though in as many sighes, as words, to acquaint him with it, which I did, & which I had no sooner done, than he only told me, I had obligingly deluded him, since by the excess of my sorrow, he thought I had assum'd it for some fresh danger of the Princess's. Whilst things were in this Posture in the Castle, those in the Palace were in as sad a one; for Partheissa's ignorace of my Prince's condition was more deplorable to hir, than the knowledge of it was to him, she expected every minute the Messenger of hir Death in the messenger of his; & hir affection was so high, and perfect, that it needed not the help of hir resolution, to follow his Fate; & though Emilia gave hir very pregnant consolations, yet they were too-weak for so strong a Melancholly, which necessitated hir to keep hir Bed, whereby she was ignorant of that fatall Theater, which was erecting within sight of hir Window, out of which Emilia unfortunatly looking, discover'd it, & in the consequences that sight inspir'd hir with, she fell into a fainting; the noyse of hir fall, made the Princess look what was the cause of it, which when she had discover'd, she call'd some of the Servants to hir assistance, which proved so effectuall, that it gave hir strength enough to tell Parthenissa, what depriv'd hir abolutely of hirs; Emilia soon repented what she had said, and had much more cause to do so, when after an hours Tryall of hir prescriptions for ending a swound, she found them all fruitless; but Nature at length did what Art could not, & the first signe the Princess gave of hir recovery, was a signe of hir affection to my Prince, of whose condition she pressingly askt the ignorant hearers; their silence was not ascrib'd to that Cause, but to a more dangerous one, out of which faith Emilia remov'd hir, by protesting, they knew nothing of what she demanded, neither of the cause of erecting the Scaffold, which none of those were about it could tell; & therein she spoke the Truth, for though she often askt out of the Window for what end those Men were set a work, yet she could never learn it. Attabbanes in the mean time had taken me into a Closet contiguous to his Chamber, where by the pressingst conjurations he was capable of, he enjoyn'd me not to give him so pregnant an evincement of my disaffection to him, as to deplore his going to a better place; That I would concern'dly endeavour to console the fair Parthenissa for the like Grief, on the same cause, and that whilst she would doe me the honor of retaining me near hir Person, that I would not decline it. 'Twas only in Tears that I answer'd these impossible Commands, and if he thought I promis'd to observe them, he deriv'd that belief from my silence, not me. The hour of rest being come, Artabbanes lay'd himself down on his Bed, with as little disorder, as if he had bin as near his ordinary, as eternall sleep; only the fair Name of Parthenissa stole sometimes out of his mouth, but never unaccompany'd with some sighes, to demonstrate for whom he breath'd them: Oh Gods! (said Symander) it were almost as hard to describe the fears I was in that fatall Night, as to believe how free my Prince was from any; who about the dawn of Day was awakened by the noyse of some who open'd the Doors, & Guessing at their designe by what I had acquainted him with, he rose up and told me, come Symander we must part, but this one Testimony of my Enemyes Power, & Malice, will eternally free me from resenting another; let the rememberance of so high an advantage extinguish all repinings the purchase of it may inspire: Doe me too, I conjure thee, this last obligation, as to tell my Princess, I dy'd with Parthenissa in my Mouth, and that my breath expir'd in repeating the fair name of hir, for whom only I drew it. These words were hardly spoken, when Surena (waited on by some of his Guards) came into the Chamber, whom he commanded out again, and then came to my Prince and told him: Artabbanes, I must acknowledge I have twice receiv'd my Life at your hands; the first when you had taken from me the Victory; and the second when you had taken from me what I valu'd a thousand times more; & though some have represented to me, that the former proceeded from your Revenge, and the latter from your Ignorance; yet I hold it fit to make my acknowledgement the giving you both your Life, and Liberty; I am confin'd unto this, if that information be true, by the dictates of virtue; and if false, by those of gratitude; I know you are not only my Ryvall, but even successfully so; and I know how vast a prejudice this will bring both to my Passion, and my Affaires; I tell you thus much that you may be convinc'd I am not ignorant of what I doe; & I tell you no more, lest I might lessen the merit of the action, by repeating it. Great Gods! (continu'd Symander) you only know my joy at so unheard-of a Gallantry, and you doe consequently know that it was greater than his, on whom it was conferr'd. The time, & the strangeness of the thing, made me suspect I did dream, but it was so pleasing a one, that I apprehended the doing of any thing which might tell me whether I did so, or noe; I esteem'd it too-great to be reall, yet was loath to interrupt what gave me more satisfaction, than ever any reciev'd in that which is the foundation of dreams. You will pardon (said the fathfull Servant, to Artavasdes and Callimmachus) my transports, when you remember what gives them a being; but not to need your pardon a second time, I will break off what I hope has made me as much deserve, as need it. Artabbanes, as soon as Surena had done speaking, with a look which seem'd to be as much pleas'd with the manner of the obligation, as with the obligation it self, told his Ryvall; Surena is too-generous to give me my Life, and Liberty, therby to confine me from employing either in a Service, for which only they are considerable to me; if that were to be my Ransome, 'twere such a one, as I would never pay; for 'tis a more pleasing Fate to dye for the fair Parthenissa, than to purchase my Life at the rate of being ty'd from serving hir. I speak this (said my Prince) not that I have so low an opinion of Surena, as to believe he is capable of selling a generous performance at any price; or that he could think I would buy it so, but only that those who hereafter understanding from whom I derive my Life, & Liberty, and how I employ them, may not condemn my so doing, since I declare when I am in your Power, what I intend when I am out of it; 'tis no ill payment to acquaint you, I can make you none, since thereby I publish the belief I have of your virtue, whose highest operation is to confer obligations not only where there is no hopes of a return, but even where there is a certainty of none; my condition makes me more gratefull, than any other way my fancy could, & were I to judge who has the happiest share in this performance, I should conclude, the Giver has. In what I do (reply'd Surena) I never expected so much as I have already receiv'd; to have made what you mention'd the purchase of my performance, had not bin to have given your Life, and liberty to you, but to me; no Artabbanes, if I confine you unto any thing, it is only to believe my action is as free from designe, as it is; & if to that obligation you will add this other, of excusing my disputing Parthenissa with the Arms of Honor, as I will not disrelish your doing the like, I shall receive a satisfaction, my condition any other way cannot affoard me. Your performance (said my Prince) cannot be more generous than I believe it, & what you mention, should be rather my desire, than my grant; and if in it I resent any trouble, it proceeds from a latitude I thence receive, of drawing my Sword against one, for whom, when Parthenissa comes not in competition, I would as joyfully employ it, as for hir. These Ryvalls (said Symander) by severall passages of this quality, gave each other but too- pregnant evincements how unfortunate they were in being so, and spent so much time in this employment, that the Sun found them in it. Artabbanes, doubtless, had interrupted it sooner to begg a permission of kissing his princess's hands before his departure, had he not apprehended, his Ryvall would have esteem'd the increasing of obligations, an uncivill way of paying them. Surena, who it may be knew my Prince's impatiences by his own (for he had bin as long depriv'd of seeing Parthenissa as Artabbanes had bin, and knew how unwelcome his visits would prove, did not he accompany him in them) made that overture to my generous Master, which he would not to him; The transports in which he receiv'd it, were much greater than those with which he receiv'd the late gift of Surea's, which evidec'd he was more concern'd in his Passion, than in his Liberty and Life; which it may be invited Surena to commend, what he dislik'd. Artabbanes suddenly after, went out of the Castle with Surena, and in a Charriot from thence to the Pallace, where he sent in a Page to Parthenissa's Appartment, to beg the honor of seeing hir: She was much surpriz'd at the request, but much more when having granted it, she found hir fears so obligingly deluded; Surena, whilst hir joy confin'd hir to silence, broke his own, by telling hir; If Madam, I have bin seemingly faulty, 'twas only to avoyd being really so; and if I have hitherto occasion'd your hate, 'twas but to avoyde deserving it; I was, Madam, by Merinzor's Partizans, so narrowly observ'd, and so much over-power'd, that had they but suspected my designe, they had both punish'd, & prevented it; you cannot doubt but to counterfeit was absolutly necessary, when I made your sufferings, my disguise; I know that you were too-too-much concern'd in Artabbaes's safety, to let you know I resolv'd it; That might have prov'd too- dangerous a discoverie, and your not being sad-enough, might have given you cause to have bin so; but as soon as I procur'd a power to resist Merinzor's, I acted that which only the want of it has hitherto hinder'd; and I was necessitated to secure the happy Artabbanes's libertie, with that with which I pretended to secure his Execution; Yes fair Parthenissa, such power the Gods have given you over me, that when my satisfaction, & yours, come in competition, I consider the loss of the first, to be the acting of the last, & finde I cannot quarrell with them for rendering me unfortunate, since thereby they make me preserve you from becoming so; but (Madam) I am too-injurious to intrench on that little time your Artabbanes has to entertain you in, which that he may the more unconstrainedly, I shall leave him to a libertie, I believe you do as much desire, as he. Surena having ended speaking, withdrew himself, & that so suddenly, that Parthenissa in the operations of hir joy and wonder, could make no returns to him that had created them; but when that eloquent silence was expir'd, she told my Prince; Surena may attribute that to one civilitie, which I consider as intended to another; for the pretence of his withdrawing, was to give us the libertie of discourse; but I believe the reall cause, is, that he knew mine (if he had stay'd to hear it) would have come as short of what it ought to be, as this performance excells all his others: But Artabbanes who knew how little time was allotted him, and how much was allotted Surena, acquainted his Princess with all those particulars I have so largely deduced, and magnify'd his Ryvalls Gallantrie, in terms, which resented their Truth, in their deliverie. This just dutie being finish'd, he told hir; This (Madam) is the first time that I thought I could leave you without regreet, the hopes, that by going from you now, I shall be the sooner uncapable of repeating the like misfortune, is my consolation in it, neither can you doubt your deliverance is less my ambition, than dutie, when in order to the acting of it, I can without reluctancie employ my Life and libertie, against the Bestower of them. The world must be convinc'd your freedome is more dear unto me, than both those, by making it a higher consideration; yet in that action of ingratitude, I shall evidence my self gratefull, by proving I decline the lesser obligation, but to satisfie the greater. Alas (said the Princess) are you so low reduc'd, that an act of unkindness must be an argument of your Love? must I endure a reall misfortune, for an imaginary good? when I consider those innumerable dangers my condition will engage you in, and those many more which your Courage and impatience will, I could esteem Surena more obliging, if he were less, and if he converted your libertie into an imprisonment, my trouble then would extend but to pitie, now it does to fear, it may be to despair; believe me, my Artabbanes, I finde more subject for sorrow in the way you undertake my Libertie, than if I had eternally lost it; that misfortune would but relate to Parthenissa, but the other does to Artabbanes, who is much more pretious to hir, than she is to hir self. Ah Madam! (my Prince reply'd) can you then believe whilst I have an existence, that your perpetuall imprisonment would but relate unto your self? and can you think the Gods have so miraculously given me the power to use my sword, to render the Will a Sin; no my Princess, these strange and intricate obstructions, are not to suppress, but trie our Faith; neither can we think them what they are, and believe we shall continue as we are; I go with a belief of success proportionate to my desire of it, and if I have any doubts, 'tis not of your deliverance, but that I may be thought unworthy the acting it; if I be, I will find my Martyrdome where I expect my Felicitie, and die in that service, in which I ambition'd to live. These words made Parthenissa look pale, & drew some Tears into hir Eyes, which to take him from considering, she reply'd; If the Gods should esteem Artabbanes unworthy the title of my Deliverer, I will assume it my self; my hand shall act my liberty, if in so fatall a way it be deny'd to his; Doe not think I shall need any invitation to follow you, but the knowing you are gone before, & therefore flatter not your self with a belief, that the breaking my imprisonment can be reserved for any other, for 'tis like my inclinations, and consequently entirely for Artabbanes. Madam (said my Prince) I consider not this declaration is to make me less hazardous in your service, but to invite the Gods that I may perform it; I have now an internall assurance of that Blessing, for since your Liberty cannot be acted but by me, & since not to have it acted were too-great a Sin to be believ'd, I must be as confident of the way, as of the end; 'Twas above half an hour (continu'd Symander) that these generous Lovers entertain'd themselves in resembling discourses, which had not so soon receiv'd a period, but that they consider'd Surea was in an anti-Chamber expecting their separation, which was so passionate, and sad, that the relation of it, would rather prove your trouble, than the omission. My Prince in the same Room he found his Ryvall in, would there have taken leave of him; but he did not permit it, and accompany'd him to a Pass some Twenty Furlongs from Arsacia, left the Treachery of Merinzor's Partizans, might have render'd that place the Scene of a Tragedy, he was so concern'd to prevent. After many Embraces, and Civilities, Artabbanes told his Ryvall; If the employing my Life, and Liberty against the generous Surena for Parthenissa, may be excus'd, by my employing them for him, where hir service comes not in competition, I dare truly profess, I shall deserve to be so; For I will out of Gratitude, repeat dangers as high, as those obligations which confine me to mine, neither can I but be convinc'd by what you do to Parthenissa, of what you will doe to Artabbanes; for your Passion makes you think it fit (at least pardonable) to act against your Inclination; and your Love for the Princess, makes you doe things, which might eve call that Love in question, did not the knowledge of the cause, seemingly appologize for the effect; That Adoration I have for the fair Parthenissa, has the same production in me: I know, I should give you that Life, & Liberty I receive from you, but I have no concerns above my flame, and the inspirer of it, that which causes my fault, does yours; neither can you consider what I must doe in the future, but if you reflect upon what you doe at the present, you will acknowledge, we are both innocent, or both excusable. This is all (continu'd my Prince) that I beg of Surena, unless it be to furnish me with an occasion of serving him, though as full of danger as my resolution is of contemning all, which may evidence a gratitude, whose greatness hardly knows any thing equall, but my desires of manifesting it. Surena was ready to give my Prince a reply, when about 200 Horse came a full Trot towards the Ryvalls, as they were in each others Arms; This unexpected accident broke off their Civilities, and made them gallop to the head of a hundred Parthian Horse, who were Surena's Guard; his Servants & some of my Prince's (for then I was not come up, having stay'd some time to kiss the fair Emilia's hands, & to settle a course for a future Correspondency) made themselves a reserve to this little Body, which resolutely advanc'd to give those a Charge who were coming precipitatly to give them one; Surena as they march'd, told Artabbanes, I have too good an opinion of you and of my self, to think it fit to give you an assurance that I am innocent of this Infidelity; but if what I have done, has not rais'd in you that belief, what I am going to doe, will. My Prince had only leasure to tell him, that what he had really done, was of so clear a quality, that what he was now going to doe would not justifie, but increase his obligations; For the Enemy was come so near, that one of those Two which lead them, cry'd out, 'Tis not Surena, but Artabbanes we seek; To which Surena reply'd; Traytor, in seeking the one thou seekest both, & in attempting the one thou shalt find the Revenge, or act the Death of both; & thereupon piercing like Thunder through a Battalion of the Enemies, he made so large a Passage for those which follow'd him, that they found it as easie, as others found it strange; My Prince made a proportionate charge, for the resolution and the success; and 'twice that day saved a Life, which had not bin hazarded but for him, nor preserv'd but by him: The inequalitie of the numbers render'd the Dispute equal; but by my continuing behind to kiss the fair Emilia's hands, I had weaken'd our Party of a a small force, on whose arrivall with me, the Enemie that were then wavering, fled, and found that death in their Flight, which they had endeavour'd to avoyd by it. The Two generous Friends & Ryvalls celebrated their victorie, and deliverance, by many embraces, which were given with so good grace, that it created a generall Quarrell to Fortune, for having so long deferr'd it, & which in the future was to break it again: One would have guest by my Prince's retributions, that his Life had bin pretious to him; but those that knew Parthenissa was in Surena's hands, knew withall, that it was to his Gallantrie, not his own safetie, that he payd them. I amuse not my self to particularize those signall expressions; those two generous Enemies made one another before their separation, which was perform'd by either's contracting too good an opinion of his Ryvall, for their unfortunate condition: But Surena's was at least silenc'd, if not supprest, by his return that Day to Parthenissa, to whom my Prince by a private Messenger, gave so ample, and handsome an accompt of that Dayes proceeding, that his reception relish'd more of having assum'd Artabbanes's felicitie, than of having bin his Protector; and his ignorance from whence so obliging an usage was deriv'd, inspir'd him with hopes, which could not have a more flattering, than false foundation. My Prince in the mean time, with a Guard Surena had forc'd him to take for his Defence, continu'd his journey by a hastie Travell towards Chrisapolis, where he heard Zenophon was leavying Forces to relieve his King, and to bring the Fate of Media to a more equall dispute, than Tygranes's precipitation had already allow'd it. Artabbanes was no sooner arriv'd at Chrisapolis, than he discharg'd Surena's Convoy, with rewards more proportionate to the Giver, than Receivers. He made his entrie into the Citie by Night, only waited upon by me; and having taken up a retyr'd lodging, enquir'd of the Master of it, the News that was then stirring, who told him, That Zenophon, but six dayes before, had receiv'd an express from Tygranes, which told him, their chiefest Magazine of victuals in Ecbatan, had bin destroy'd by a Traytor that had the Care of it, which had reduc'd him to such extremitie, that if not immediately relieved, his hopes were not to live, but die a King; that he despair'd not but by a small accessionall relief, to revenge his former disgrace, in the same place in which it had befallen him, and that therefore Zenophon, with whatever Force he could make on the place, should advance by incessant Marches towards Ecbatan. This was so true and pressing an Intelligence, that Zenophon having formerly appointed a generall Rendezvous, too-late for this Necessitie, took of his Army, about 8000 Horse and Foot, which were the nearest, and readiest Forces, & with those, two dayes since, advanced to the relief of his King, having left order that the residue should follow with an expedition, which might evidence the cause from whence it proceeded. My Prince was very Pensive at this information, and much more sorrie the destinie of Media should be decided without him, he being in it. Whilst he was engag'd in such Thoughts, mine were employ'd how to remove their cause, and at last resolving that in so emergent a Necessitie, he ought publickly to avow himself, to see what influence Moneses's bloud had over the Medians, and to have Arms in his hands, to oppose Merinzor, should the Gods make him the Instrument of punishing Tygranes's Ingratitude to my Prince's Father; as also to dispute Parthenissa with Surena, with more equall Arms than those by which he had lost hir: I concluded too, that Zenophon would not intrust so considerable a concern as Chrisapolis into any hands, but those, whose inclinations he was as confident of, as of his own; and therefore Artabbanes ought not to apprehend the disclosing himself to the Governor of it, and to Head those Forces which were embodying, as Seconds to Zenophon's flying Army. These reasons were so pregnant to me, that I acquainted my generous Master with them, to whom they appear'd the same, and who therefore immediately commanded me to invite the Governor to give him a visit, which he would have then pay'd him, had he not esteem'd it fitter to receive his advice in private, than go and perhaps render himself uncapable of observing it, by desiring it first in publick. I went with joy to obey these orders, & being without much difficulty admitted into the Governors Chamber, I drew him aside, and told him the cause of my doing so; He receiv'd the Intelligence with great astonishment, but I soon found, his was deriv'd from an obliging, not a dangerous Cause, for 'twas in eloquent, and passionate returns, that he thank'd the Gods for sending, and me for bringing him such Newes; he went therefore (follow'd by all the Gentlemen & Officers then about him) to my Prince's Lodging, but by the way, the Flame being diffus'd over the City, there was hardly any in it, but those that waited on the Governor, or that went upon the same employment. I purposely omit the exceeding deep submissions, and the proportionate acclamations, this throng of Friends made my Prince, & utter'd for his return. The Governor (an old and unalterable Friend to Moneses and his Family) told him; The Gods Sir, have doubtless reduced this Kingdome to so low an ebb, to evidence your restauration was of more concernment than the Quiet of it, since they have depriv'd it of the last, to act the first; and it is more than probable, that they will acquaint us 'twas your absence involv'd us in Wars, by making your return give a period to them; we are therefore come, Sir, to offer you our Swords, & Lives, which we doubt not under such a Generall, will vanquish greater obstacles than your Courage will now encounter; which has already acted too-many things, to leave us the least pretence of doubt, it is uncapable of performing any. Artabbaes in words, and actions, altogether sensible, and obliging, made them finde their affection, and Civilities, were not unfruitfully placed; & to let them know he ambition'd nothing more than to engage his Life in that Countrey, in which he found so many willing to adventure theirs with him; as also to give Merinzor's first infusions the lye, in a way, which also should punish it; he conjur'd them, that the next Morning, all such forces of Horse as they thought fit to honor him with, and as could be rendevouz'd by then, might be so, with which he despair'd not to overtake Zenophon, and to share in his Countryes Fate. The Governor immediatly commanded all the Officers to see those orders obey'd, and in the future, to receive theirs from Artabbanes, who that Night he permitted not to cotinue in those Lodgings, but brought him to the Castle, where his reception spoke the heart; with which it was made. The Sun the next morning was not risen, when all the Streets of Chrisapolis eccho'd with the noise of Trumpets, & Clarions, and not above an hour after, a great Plain on the North side of the City, was cover'd with 3000 Horse, whereof a Third Part, were Volunteers, which the only Name of Artabbanes drew under his Colours; The other two Parts were of such as had bin drawn together by Zenophon's orders before his hasty depart: The Body (though small) was not unconsiderable, having my Prince at the head of it; and this they were all so sensible of, that Artabbanes found they were so by their very looks. After a short Speech, rather to let them know he knew their resolution, than to raise it, he embraced the Governor, whose Age dispenc'd him from the Field, & began his March towards Ecbatan; Three dayes with wonderfull celerity he follow'd the traces of Zenophon's Army, without overtaking it; but the Fourth, from the high mountain of Dormus, he discover'd afar off, the Walls of Ecbatan; that sight refresh'd his almost wearied Troops, & made them so to accelerate their pace, that before the Sun was five hours from his Set, they were come near-enough to perceive both Armies were joyn'd, and were disputing their hopes, and desires by the Sword; on which they were so intent, that his arrivall, nor his little Armies salluting their Friends by a shout, and their Enemies by a menacing Crie, could not in the least measure so much as suspend, or lessen the fury of either side. My Prince was much more pleas'd with the resolution of his friends, than with their number, which with the addition of his Forces, did not equall the one half of the Enemies, whose multitudes he observ'd were so long hinder'd from prevailing, by a Gentleman in blue Arms, whose Helmet was shadowed with a Plume of Feathers of the same colour. This generous Warrior carried victorie to his side where ever he was, but his friends lost it where ever he was not; so that not being ubiquitary, the Armenian Royall-Armie was giving ground, before my Prince could joyn it. I design'dly pass over the particulars of this great Day, to tell you the conclusion of it, which was, that though Artabbanes, did like Artabbanes both in courage and conduct, yet by the fall of the Gentleman in blue Armor, and by being necessitated twice to save the King of Media's Life, & remount him, it was almost dark, before the Gods had put a period to the Battell, & he to the Execution; in which the Traytor Merinzor fell, and above 20000 of his side, so that my Prince's Revenge, and his Victorie, were both concluded in one action; such signall events could not but produce resembling joyes in him, who return'd from the Pursuit with his victorious Troops, to present them, and himself to Tygranes, whose Tent he found inviron'd with Tears, instead of acclamations, which was occasion'd by a fatall wound the King, at the conclusion of the Day, had receiv'd by an Arrow shot at random; Artabbanes (by an excess of generositie) at the newes, assum'd a grief as reall, as great; and learning the faithfull Zenophon was by Tygranes, he went without any interruption where he lay: The King (though extream ill, no sooner saw my Prince's Arms, than he cry'd out, 'Tis to that generous Person that I owe twice a Life, which the Gods are resolv'd no longer to lend me; but I desire that the last action of it, may be to embrace and acknowledge my Deliverer. Artabbanes at these obliging words, pull'd off his Helmet, and Zenophon no sooner saw his Face, than he cry'd out; 'Tis Artabbanes, 'tis Artabbanes: Who prostrating himself before his King, told him, The Gods (Sir) are my witnesses, that I had long since the ambition to pay you those services, which you are now pleased so much to over-value, had not the Traytor Merinzor, by false suggestions brought you into so great a diffidence of that Truth, that the Danger of coming to manifest it, was almost as great, as were my desires to do it; but those Powers which vindicate Innocence, have at length brought Merinzor to that Fate, he would have impos'd on Moneses, and have made one a Contributer to that Iustice, which has hitherto suffer'd, by his having occasion'd the suspending of yours. This free, and generous declaration, made Tygranes believe 'twas my Prince, as much as Zenophon's naming him; for he had never known him, but by that Character the faithfull Zenophon had given of his Person, and Minde. Tygranes, who found the hand of Death upon him, believ'd he could not more excuse the Crimes of his Life, than to silence that hatred which had bin the highest offence in it, was beginning to manifest a Conversion which had nothing of imperfection in it, but that it had not earlier shined, when some Gentlemen brought in one into the Kings Tent (for there was never a one set up but his, neither had that bin, but for the danger of carrying him to Ecbatan) who though almost cover'd with bloud, yet some internalls disclos'd, that his Arms, before they had bin so fatally stain'd, were of Azure, which made Artabbanes not only know 'twas that gallant Man, the want of whose assistance had so long suspended his victorie, but deplore his loss, at a rate which even countervail'd his success. These were the dictates his inclinations to generositie inspir'd him with, but as soon as the wouded Gentlemans Helmet was taken off, he saw in his dying looks the charming features of the Prince Syllaces; Oh Gods! what did not my afflicted Master utter at so sad a sight; without so much as considering Tygranes (whose Tears were so obliging, as a while to interpose between his sight and the object which created them) he fell on his generous friend, and exprest by Groans, when his words fail'd him, such signall, and pressing sorrows, that it even divided those of the spectators, and made them think him as just an object for their Grief, as he had esteem'd his friend, for his: I will not determine whether the Aire which Syllaces receiv'd by the opening of his Helmet, or Artabbanes's tormenting him, or the Mercy of the Gods, who thought it unjust to separate two so exactly united, that restor'd the generous Prince to Life; but this is most certain, that before the Chyrurgions had given him a Cordiall, he was almost in a condition not to need one; and had bin entirely so, if after having a while faintly opened his Eyes, & discover'd Artabbanes, he had not embraced him so passionatly (fearing perhaps never to doe it again) that all his wounds opened, and by a second floud of Bloud, cast him into a second fainting. Tygranes, whether out of sympathy, or a precedent weakness, fell into the same condition, which so divided the care, & Tears of all that were present, that never any Victory was esteem'd so dearly purchac'd, or so ill celebrated. It was about half an hour before the Chyrurgions brought either the King or Sillaces to that Life which had seemingly abandon'd them; but the last of them return'd to it much sooner than the first, for his wounds were of a far less dangerous nature, and being bound up, as also forbidden any more such unfortunate Demonstrations of his Friendship, as his late embraces had prov'd, he began to ask of Artabbanes, his Adventures; but in so confused a way, that the disorder could not be greater, than his concernd in them thereby appear'd: The ones curiosity, & the others obedience, were a time suspended by Tygranes's temporary recovery, this was but a Lightning before Death, which made such violent, and rude approches, that he needed not the Chyrurgions Art to learn his Fate; which he first told the two friends of, and that with a constancy, which equal'd their sorrows. The generous Sillaces, whether as a Freind to my Prince, or Tygranes, so successfully made the latter sensible of the wrong he had done Moneses & his whole Family, that he seem'd more afflicted for that, than for his present condition, which receiv'd no small refreshment by Artabbanes protesting he was extreamly afflicted, that his first Service should be his last, & that he would wrong Moneses more than he ever had, if he believ'd not to have found out his mistake, was the greatest reparation he ever expected for it. Tygranes confused with many such flattering expressions, publiquely declared, Moneses was his legitimate Successor, & Artabbanes after him, which was received with more joy, than there were open expressions of it; Then turning a languishing Look towards Sillaces, he told him; And you generous Prince, cannot you furnish me with some occasion before my Death, to evidence the esteem I have of your Friendship, and of those signall obligations you have conferr'd on me? Sillaces was so struck at that fatall Question, that he had not the power to make it any return; which Tygranes observing, he comanded all in the Tent but my Prince, and Zenophon, to leave it, which being obey'd, addressing his discourse to my generous Masters friend, told him; It was with no small satisfaction, that I learn'd one of my bloud could captivate Sillaces; though I have seem'd ignorant of your affairs, yet I am not so much a Stranger to them, but that I know Lindadory is honor'd with a passion you have for hir, and hir Father has declyn'd making hir the reward of it, upon considerations, which will more extenuate my usage towards him, than any thing I can say in my own justification; I conjure you therefore (Tygranes continu'd, speaking to Artabbanes) that you let your Father know my last request, which I even deliver with my dying breath, is, that your Sister, may be allowed the liberty of hir own election, and that he may not be entierly disprovided of what is requisite for the maintaining of both their Qualities, I hereby confer on Sillaces, all the false Merinzors forfeited Estates, & the Estates of all those who have adhaer'd to him; Had the Gods bin pleas'd to have given me the fair Lindadory, I would thus have given hir: Moneses cannot suspect a Councell I would my self have practic'd, and in which he will receive as much satisfaction, as I should, were I confident he would observe my desires. The generous Sillaces at the end of these words, would have flung himself at Tygranes Feet, as some expression of his satisfaction, which could hardly exceed the Kings, when Artabbanes assur'd him in Moneses Name of an exact obedience to his Commands; Never was there a Tent at once so replenish'd, with Tears, and joy, as this; and perhaps never was there more cause for either. It seems the Gods had protracted the King of Media's Life, that the expiration of it, might repair the faults in it; for, some two hours after, he dyed, in discourses so constant, that the manner of his Death, consol'd the Beholders of it. Artabbanes and Sillaces having given their Tears to so great a fall, Zenophon took care to have Moneses proclaimed King throughout the Armie, and Citie, which was receiv'd with acclamations so loud, that in the largeness of them, there was evidenc'd a proportionate joy. The Funeralls of Tygranes were the next day celebrated with a Military pomp, his bodie being afterwards interr'd in the Tomb of his Fathers, over which my Prince erected so proud a Monument, that his goodness was known, in his Magnificence. Whilst these requisite duties were paying, Sillaces's recovery was so much advanc'd, that the doubt of it was no longer Artabbanes's fear, who every day with Zenophon, acknowledg'd him the Protector of Media, and restorer of Moneses, who by a solemn Embassie, was invited from a Solitude to a Crown, the greatest and least extreams. Neither did Artabbanes omit the Gallantrie of his Friend, nor Tygranes's last request for him, and his engagement on it. Things of a Civill concernment put into this posture, the forming of a considerable Army, was my Prince's next care, which he was more troubl'd how to employ, than how to raise; For his Interest, and the many Peoples hopes which depended on him, and served under him, were very rationall inducements immediately to march & cut off the Roots of so dangerous, and so near extinguish'd a Rebellion; but the going to attempt Arsacia, and to force Parthenissa from Surena, were more powerfull inducements to flie with his Armie to so glorious, and ambition'd a Designe; for the undertaking of which, he fortified his inclinations with these Reasons; That no consideration should transcend that of a generous and fruitfull Flame; That an occasion of Conquering a Kingdome might every day be offer'd, but that of releasing the fair Parthenissa seldom or never; who could not be more troubl'd at the cause of the continuance of hir sufferings, than at the sufferings themselves, and that thereby he would more injure hir, than Sutena had; That entirely to extinguish the Rebellion, there needed not a War, but a Progress over the Kingdome; That Zenophon, with such Forces as the joy of this Change would draw under his Colours, would be more than sufficient to finish what was so far advanc'd; and that by the dictates of Reason, as well as Love, he ought to employ his Courage, where it was probably to meet with the brightest resistance; and that was, where Surena was in Person, who was not only the most considerable Enemie for Power, and Resolution, but being a Forreigner, and having Parthia to befriend him, ought first to be attempted, & dislodg'd. The Generous Sillaces's opinion, and Reasons, concurring with my Prince's herein, he assum'd the Resolution, and that too-firmly to admit of the least shadow of variation; The next morning therefore in a generall Assembly of the Officers, my Prince acquainted them with his designe, which he fortified with such pregnant reasons, & deliver'd in such an accent, as made many believe he rather summon'd them to approve his Counsell, than to receive theirs; so that partly out of judgement, partly out of complyance, the result of the meeting was an unanimous approving of the motion. Artabbanes therefore immediately gave Zenophon Commission to Command an Army for the reduction of Media to Moneses's Power, and three dayes after, had a generall Rendezvous of all his Forces, under the Walls of Ecbatan, which he divided into two equall Parts, giving Zenophon the one, and taking the other to himself. Sillaces was yet so ill of his wounds, that he was not capable of undertaking the Command of Zenophon's Armie, nor of so much as accompanying my dear Master in his. I omit the sad words at their separation, which was no longer delay'd than that time took up, which was employ'd in the last embraces, & in Artabbanes's leaving his generous Friend the Command of all things behinde, and of the whole Kingdome, in case the Fortune of the War drew him out of it; My Prince too, found some consolation in Sillaces continuance in Ecbatan, That, being the Metropolis of Media, and consequently the place which Moneses would reside at; whereby he might not only have the opportunitie of being near the King, and it might be of Lindadory, but that also by the inevitable charms of his conversation, procure from the former, the latter. My impatient Master having thus disintangl'd himself from all obstacles, which might any longer protract his so passionately ambition'd March, began it the next day, with an Army, which though not consisting of above 14000 Horse and Foot, yet in the Quarrell it had assum'd, he thought unresistable. The next day after we had left Ecbatan, our Spies brought us in word, that Vixores (Surena's brother) had safely recover'd Arsacia, with all those Parthias that had escaped Merinzor's defeat, which with some other Reliques of that Partie, had so increast Surena's Troops, that learning the weakness of ours, he was determin'd to bring the dispute to a Field, and had dispatch'd away Vixores for all those Forces, which yet continu'd an intestine War in Parthia, that if the Gods blasted his first hopes, he might not be divested of all. Artabbanes with unequall'd satisfaction receiv'd this advice, for he thought every thing a felicitie which avoided protraction: And lest Surena's secodthoughts might prove less obliging tha his first, my generous Master so precipitated his March, that in eight dayes he discover'd those happie and fatall Walls, within which the fair Parthenissa made hir involuntary residence; not far from whence he discover'd Surena's Camp, which was scituate in a most advantagious and convenient place. Never (continu'd Symander) did I observe in my Prince's looks so much of contentment and sorrow intermingl'd; the first was deriv'd from his vicinitie to his Princess, and from the Power he had to dispute hir by Arms; & the last was, from the reluctancie he had contracted for the necessitie of employing his Life against one, from whom he had so often receiv'd it, and for whom he had a Friendship so great, that nothing could come in competition with it, but the Passion he had for Parthenissa. Whilst his Army was drawing up, he resolv'd to write to Surena, to whom he sent a Trumpet with this ensuing Letter.  is your Apologie for that performance; must be Mine for employing my Sword, and Life, against him from whom I derive them; VVould to the Gods your Flame were not so great that that it self should prove its Crime; but that you would give the fair Parthenissa the freedom of hir election, and submit, to what we cannot, nor ought not to oppose. That if we cannot finde out our happiness in hir making of it, we would make our own, in the making of hirs; I should then carrie Arms for the generous Surena, with a much more transcendent joy, than I could obtain a victorie against him, by them;  & he should then suddenly learn, that though my Love be infinite, my Friendship is proportionate, and that if I give the former the precedencie, the difference proceeds as much from my Fate, as my Inclination.  This Letter was sent by a Trumpet to Surena, who receiv'd and read it to himself at the head of his Armie, which was then drawn up to decide their difference: He went a little aside, and after a short consideration, return'd this Answer:  themselves, should have none but them for Iudges, they had not now furnish'd us with what will bring it to their decision; which their having effected, though it makes my friendship for you, esteem it a misfortune, yet it makes my Flame for Parthenissa, consider it as a Providence, and so signall a one, that I must not decline it; VVe need not fear partialitie before such a Tribunall, he that least undeserves Parthenissa, will have it this day demonstrated by a Divine Sentence, which cannot deliver a higher Truth, than that in all occasions but this, I will employ my Sword for you with as much satisfaction, as in this I do it with Reluctancie.  My Prince at the same time he receiv'd this Letter, saw Surena's Armie march from their Camp into a Plain, which he judged, the Generall of it, had elected for the Scene of the Battell. I cannot tell you the confusions he was in at his Ryvalls Resolution, which forc'd him to evince his Love, by the suspension of his Gratitude. This Noble Trouble resign'd its Empire to his joy of having brought the redemption of the fair Parthenissa to so immediate a Tryall. Artabbanes having view'd Surena's Armie, found by his Computation, that their Numbers, and Strength, were resembling, to all Iudgements but his own, who thought any force inferior to his, when he consider'd the occasion and Recompence of his Quarrell. Neither was Surena void of the like belief, and in those dictates both the Generalls began the Battell, which though it merits a retayl'd Relation, yet I shall only acquaint you; That the two Ryvalls having a hunder'd times rally'd their broken Troops,  & as many times turned the Victory, that the reward of it could hardly transcend the Courages which disputed it; at length they met, which as soon as Artabbanes discover'd, he ended the Combat, by avoyding it; Twice that Day he repeated the same action on the same score. Oh Gods! (continu'd Symander) what an influence has a transcendent Gratitude on a generous Minde? Artabbanes flyes from an Enemies Sword, when even that Enemie was as much so to Parthenissa, as to him, or rather more so to the latter, by being equally so to the former; but Fate forc'd my Prince to what his Inclination would have avoyded, and indeed Surena so solicitously courted my generous Master to the Combat, that it may be what did induce him to avoyde it, now did to embrace it; since 'twas Gratitude to act his Friends desires: Never, Never was there a Combate resembling this, for it transcended all others as much in the effect, as it did in the Cause; Here Artabbanes by so fighting, evinc'd what was not the Cause of his having so often avoyded it; and Surena by the largeness and unintermissiveness of his blowes, what had made him so ambition that Decision, & what he hoped would be the Reward of it. Artabbanes was mounted upon the proudest Horse in Media, who seem'd to know, whom 'twas he carry'd. Surena had under him a Parthian Horse, which yielded nothing to my Prince's, and indeed both of them seem'd not only to know, but act their Princes Designe. The Ryvalls whose Armors in the begining of the Day were of a different colour, now began to wear one Livery, by the many fountains of bloud which sprung out of them. If Parthenissa had beheld so fatall a sight, she could not but have deplor'd a Beauty, which at the same time that it evidenc'd, destroyed Courages as great as it self, and perhaps a Friendship too. Twice already the generous Cobatants had grappl'd, because their Horses grown furious with Heat, made many of their blows only wound the Aire, which to avoyd in the future, they clos'd so strongly, that their Bridles being abandon'd, and their Horses left to their own dispose, the Ryders forc'd each other out of the Saddle, and fell on the Dust in those cruell embraces; as their design was, so were their advantages, for they saluted the Ground with their sides, only Surena's Sword falling between his and the Earth, inconvenienc'd him, but so little, that Artabbanes had only the internall satisfaction of resolving he would take no advantage of it, for before he could manifest that generosity, his Enemie was in a condition not to need it. Their Horses (as I have said) sympathizing in their Masters concerns, were no sooner eas'd of their burthen, than they also began a furious fight, which ended not but with the life of Surena's; but then the survivor fetching two or three groans over his dead Enemy, fell down eternally by his side. You may think it strange (continu'd Symander) that any could so misimploy his sight, as to be able to give this relation; but it is certain, that the rareness of the Spectacle, & the generall belief that the Riders Fates would be seen in their Horses, drew the Eyes of many from the dispute of the former, upon the latter. The two Generalls already so weakned by those streams of bloud they had mutually lost, that 'twas no more their strength, but their Resolution which continu'd the Combate; this being observ'd by many of both Armies, they advanc'd to separate them, as they were leaning on the Hilts of their Swords, to take breath; Those which came to my Prince, had only these words; Doe you fear my Courage, or my Quarrell? but they had a Look which told them more: Surena's had a resembling entertainment, and to take from their Armies the opportunity of the like offence, they renew'd the fight again, with so much strength that those which fear'd they had too-little left, now did, they had too-much, by the fatall way they employ'd theirs in; You will dispence with me, generous Hearers, (said Symander) if I tell you not every Blowe in this fatall relapse, since I know so well your concerns for Artabbanes, that in so relating the Combate, I should almost act it, by wounding him afresh in your sorrows; 'tis enough you know that both of them so prodigally spent the Treasure of their Breath, and Bloud, that if Parthenissa had bin a Spectator, she must have confest hir self too-well disputed; and in brief, our Heroes having perform'd actions even as worthie our wonder, as Grief, Surena fell, and afterwards Artabbanes, but then their Knees serv'd them for Feet, as if their Hearts, the Throne of their Courages, had bin strong Forts, and were to be wone by approches. Who can tell how much Parthenissa was hated, for being so much Lov'd? and how many a Curse was utter'd against hir, for that which was the greatest to hir self? and that which she more participated in than any of her Blasphemers. To finish this fatall Dispute, I shall acquaint you, that their Knees being not so active as their Feet, only serv'd them to receive wounds, not avoid them; and their mutuall weakness made them so apprehend they scarcely should have life enuugh left to act their Deaths, that it extinguish'd all thoughts of avoiding them. Surena, like a blaze before the extinction of a Lamp, united his expiring Forces, with a Designe in one blowe to perform, what so many had but too-far advanc'd; but as his sword was in the Ayre, his bodie fell on the ground, and thereby seem'd to tell him, that his Life was more just, than he, by abandoning him, when he intended so fatally to employ it; his Eyes also, as needing no more the Light, after the Gods had decreed Parthenissa from him, shut their lids, as if they intended to impose on themselves an eternall Night. Artabbanes employ'd not that moment of breath which was left him, to assertain a success which he feared was too much so alreadie, but he resolv'd, since Surena by his Letter had left the least unworthy Title to Parthenissa, to the Gods decision, that he would employ his fading strength to declare, not act his Victorie; so that having waved his sword over his dead Ryvalls Bodie, he fell down on it, and by embraces seem'd to beg Pardon for an insulting, which his owne declaration had necessitated him unto; and which he could not have perform'd in a less criminall way. and tears this fatall Victorie was celebrated in by the Median Armie, which being fill'd with those two most predominant Passions of Ioy, and Grief, in the Dictates they inspir'd, flew on the Parthians, who being possest only with the last of them, which rather stupifies, than enflames the Courage, lost the Victorie with their Generall, and left his body as one manifestation of it. For my part (said Symander) I contributed nothing to it, for taking with me an experimented Chyrurgion, I ran to my Princes body, which I found too-large a subject for the evincement of his Art; His wounds being bound up though with no signes of Life, we erected his Tent over his Body, and lay'd him on a Pallate. And because I knew if the Gods would restore him to Life, that nothing would more accelerate his recovery, than my assurance that Surena had wanted nothing for his, I caused the care of them to be as equall, as their danger,  & carry'd Surena's body to a neighbour Tent, lest their being in one might have bin prejudiciall to both. It was at the least three hours that Artabbanes continu'd in his Swound, for his recovery out of which he had no water but my Tears; at length the Gods were pleas'd by the opening of his Eyes to dry up mine, which joy was increast by his speaking, and the first occasion of it, was (though with pain equall to the Generositie which caus'd it) to enquire after Surena. I gave him a true accompt of what I had done, for which he embrac'd me; one part of his strength being employ'd to enquire after his Enemy, and the other to reward the care of him. The ensuing Night was given entirely to rest, by which he receiv'd so high a refreshment, that next morning he had perfectly recover'd the use of speaking. The first employment he sent me upon, was to visit Surena, who I found (by resembling miracle to my Prince's) had no one wound that was mortall, and health enough recover'd, to acknowledge that Civility which sent to enquire after his. When Artabbanes knew this happy Truth, he askt of his Chyrurgions, whether the removeall of Surena to Arsacia, might be effected without any hazard, or inconvenience; to this he was answer'd, affirmatively, whereupon commanding all but me out of his Tent, he told me, Go Symander from this step to Surena, and tell him, that his Liberty which the Gods have given me as a punishment for having deny'd Parthenissa hirs, I doe restore him, & had not continu'd that Combat in which he lost it, had not our dispute bin so equall, that any overture of ending it by words, might have relisht more of a care of my self, than of him; but now that I can evince my solicitousness for him, proceeds from a clearer principle, I embrace this way of serving him with more joy, than I assume at what gives me the power of doing it: Tell him with all, that he must now offend the Gods, if he offends any longer Parthenissa, & that the former have so miraculously preserv'd his Life, to give him so large an occasion to repair the errors of it; But I fear (said Artabbanes) I speak so much of this, as it may invite him to believe I am gratefull, but in expectation that he will be more so; therefore convey him to Arsacia, and tell him only, I am at least as much troubl'd that I can not pay him that duty, as at what hinders me from it. I was (continu'd Symander) as much astonisht at this Command, as Surena was when I went to obey it, who in generous retributions axcepted of an obligation, he could neither have desir'd nor hoped. Surena's being convey'd from the Army to Arsacia, could not inspire the last with more joy, than it did the first with wonder. When he came to the Gates, which was the place where I took leave of him, he made me many Apologies for not having bin able to wait on my Prince, to have acknowledg'd a Galantry which nothing could proportion but the value he plac'd upon it, and his ambition of repaying it. Five dayes Artabbanes continu'd in more trouble from Surena's silence, than from his own wounds, which had clos'd themselves much faster, if the distempers of the Minde, had not hinder'd the cure of the Bodie. I must acknowledge I did not only believe that Surena had conveyed both himself, and Parthenissa, into some more remote place, but told my Prince so, which thought of mine he resented as ill, as he could have the performance; and though I told him, that by what Surena had formerly done, my now conclusion was not irrationall, yet I could not make my opinion his; but the sixth day, all our suspitions, and doubts were resolv'd by a Letter which Surena sent by a Trumpet; The words, to the best of my Rememberance, were these:  have prov'd a higher trouble to me, than my Friendship, and gratitude now doe; for the clearness of what I ought to perform cannot be greater, than the impossibilitie: I have pleaded your cause with my self, against my self, and have said so much for you, that could I but doe half as much to you, you would have admir'd, what I fear you will condemne. But alas, I cannot resigne up Parthenissa but with my Life; The Gods knowing this Truth, have put me into a posture of evincing it, and I shall conclude they never mean you Hir, whilst they perform not that to me: Come then generous Artabbanes to the Assault, and you shall see how willingly I will put my self in the only capacitie, by which I can present Parthenissa to you, who perhaps the Gods have not yet adjudg'd from me, since I can dispute hir in a way in which I may finde my felicitie, or be incapable of resenting the loss of it.  My Prince read these lines with as much grief as they could be written in; he found, to have the reward of one Victorie, he must act another; & yet the end of the last, could not be more pleasing, than the way was the contrary. After the disorder these reflections infus'd were vanish'd, he return'd this answer to his Ryvall.  mistaken a one, that your repeated Crime will force them to a repeated Iudgement; 'tis not your Death, but your Life which offends them, and therefore they will not punish you in the first, but the last; which they have only lengthened, that what committed the Sin, should repaire it, and to evidence this is my Faith, if the Gods make me a second time the Master of it, I shall use you at the former rate, which you may be as confident of, as I am that they will shortly put me into a capacity of manifesting, and you of making that use of it.  Artabbanes having return'd Surena's Trumpet with this Reply, immediatly order'd Arsacia to be inviron'd with his Armie, which was so numerously increast, with the Nobilitie and Gentrie which throng'd to his Ensignes, that his hopes had now no Cloud, but the protraction of them. I believe I need not tell you that my Prince, when he was recover'd, perform'd hourly the part of a Generall, an Engineer, and a Pioneer, leaving no function unpractic'd, which might accelerate his approches, and put him into a felicitie, for which he had lost so much bloud, and fought so many Battels. In brief, one Moon had so far advanc'd our hopes, that we had strong ones, another would convert them into certainties; and though Artabbanes gave many an assault to taste the resolution of the Defendants, yet he always return'd with such pregnant evincements of their greatness, that he concluded the reduction of Arsacia, was not more a work of Courage, than of time. And though this knowledge did often suspend his joyes, yet the remembrance, that only a few dayes separated him from Parthenissa, hinder'd them from being supprest. But, great Gods! (continu'd Symander) how fallacious are the Thoughts of Man? and how often do you take delight to act things improbable, and to destroy those which are not. For my Prince, who to hasten the Siege, made the Souldiers work at the approches, so assiduously, solicited their Labour, that by the excess of it, a raging Feaver invaded our Camp, and at length the Pestilence, and that in so fatall a way, that it turn'd epidemicall; and to add to this miserie, at length it ceized on my Prince too, and so dangerously, that I apprehended the loss of his Life, in that of his hopes. Oh Gods! (continu'd Symander) what prodigies did you perform in that poor Armie?  & had you no way to manifest your Power, but by your Crueltie? Yes (generous Hearers) never was there a greater mortallitie, than that in which the offended Deities visited the Median Camp: Our Ensignes were no longer guarded by those which notwithstanding did not abandon them; the Living had no employment but to bury the Dead; and our Trenches had no other Defence, than what had render'd them void of any: In the horror of this Condition, the remaining Commanders appointed a Meeting, where whilst they were advising of what course to elect, their Intelligencers came in with reitterated assurances, that Orodes, with all the Gallantry of Parthia, was come within 300 Furlongs, purposely to raise the Siege, which Surena had invited him to; This assurance taught us what to doe, so that the ensuing Night, whilst Artabbanes was so weak, that he knew not what we did, (which was a happie ignorance) we put him into a Litter, and with the Fragments of our Armie, convey'd him so far before Day, that we only fear'd his safetie from his sickness, not his Enemies. The first of these continu'd, till the arrivall of the generous Sillaces, who being in more pain not to be near his Friend, than his wounds gave him, came from Ecbatan to my Prince's retirement; this was a happiness we ow'd not to our own precaution, and yet we knew none but such a Friend durst disclose to him how much the Gods were his enemie. And had we ignor'd that Truth, we might have discover'd it by inference; since if being acquainted with it by Sillaces, accompany'd too with reasons as much as the Subject could bear, he fell into such expressions, and actions of Despair, that we thought his very grief would prove both his Misfortune, and his Cure; what would it not have a mounted unto; if neither the Speaker, nor the things spoken, had bin what they were? These miseries had this accessionall one, that our intelligencers brought us certain advertisement, Orodes had bin received at Arsacia with as much joy, as he receiv'd Surena within it, whose invitation had brought him thither, having lost all hopes in his precedent Battell, but of continuing the Siege 'till this Relief came, which he solicited by so powerfull a Reward, as the Resignation of Parthenissa, only with this Limitation, that Orodes should oblige himself by sollemn oath only to implore, not constrain hir affection; to which was added that Surena should be restored to his former Power, and favour; and both he, and his Partizans, have a plenary Act of oblivion. My Prince at this Intelligence cry'd out, ungratfull Ryvall! could'st thou divest thy self of a Flame for Parthenissa, but to repair the injuries thine had heap'd upon hir? Can Fear, and allegiance, make thee abandon what a higher Duty, & Generosity could not? & could'st thou hope relief from an action, which render'd thee unworthy of any? Whilst Love was thy fault, it was thy excuse, but now thou art as criminall in the very abandoning thy Passion, as in the assuming, & continuance of it. I should never finish, did I particularize all the evincements of my Prince's despair, which truely was so transcendent, that I believe we could hardly desire his recovery, so much, as he detested it. Sillaces, by what Surena had done, concluded of what he had not done, I meane not abandon'd his Passion, by his having deposited the object of it in the hands of so unsuccessfull a Ryvall, and one who would unavoydably continue that Name, if he perform'd his engagement to him. Artabbanes at length found so much Reason in what was his Friends, that he began by little & little to qualifie a hatred he then thought he had assum'd upon a wrong score; for he could finde his Ryvall no way excusable but by that, in which his Friend accus'd him, which was, that his Passion had the Ascendant. Whilst Artabbanes and Sillaces were reasoning upon the mutatio of their Condition, & how to act thereon, there came certain deputed Citizens out of Arsacia, who being admitted, told my Prince, that Surena had procured for them from Orodes, a Liberty to dispose of themselves, & their City as their Interest, and Inclinations should lead them; which as soon as they knew, they had acquainted Surena, that both those bound them to offer up themselves to their legittimate Prince; to which Surena reply'd, that had he not concluded they would have so employ'd the Concession, he would never have obtain'd it; and that since they were so well determin'd, he had nothing to impose on them, but his desire to assure Artabbanes, that to evidence 'twas not ambition, but Love, which made him disturbe his Kingdome, as soon as the latter had ceast, he design'd by the restitution of so considerable a Place as Arsacia, to evidence the former; and he further begg'd, that his leaving Media in a perfect Quiet, might appologize for his having broken it, which if any other should attempt; he would return with more considerable Forces to restore hir peace, than ever he had brought to interrupt it. The Arsacian Citizens, having thus perform'd Surena's part, on their Knees did their owne, by presenting Artabbanes with their Keyes, & by imploring him to believe, they had bin long since so dispos'd of, had they had the disposall of them. My Prince having rais'd them up, granted them a Pardon for a fault which indeed others had committed, and promis'd them in the Future, an affection, which should recompence their Present. He then enquir'd of them how Surena had dispos'd of himself, since he concluded by the interest he himself had now in Arsacia, that 'twas no longer the place of his residence. The Arsacians reply'd, that both he, Orodes, and Parthenissa were return'd with the Armie into Parthia, and though many had advised the employment of it against an Enemie, whose wrongs, and Power, would inspire him with Desires, and Actions of Revenge, yet by Surena's perswasions, all preventative thoughts of hostility were silenc'd. The Arsacians having a Governor given them of their own Election, were dismis'd, And then the Two Princes after a private debate, resolved, that Sillaces being now perfectly recover'd, should return into Parthia, both to act his owne Interest, and countenance my Prince's, who concluded, nothing by way of force but a Conquest of Parthia could recover Parthenissa out of it, and that such a way was both too-tedious, & uncertain; that therefore as he lost his Princess by Arts, and Slight, so he should attempt the recovering of hir, the very way of his loss, instructing him how to repair it, and therefore as soon as his strength would permit, he would follow his Friend in a Disguise, that if he regained not Parthenissa, yet at least he might see, and converse with hir, which was the next Blessing. The Prince Sillaces, having his Friend's Interest mingled with his owne, did that with joy upon both those scores, which he could not without reluctancie have undertaken upon his owne; and before he began his journey, he had the satisfaction of hearing from Zenophon, that though his Armie had found little resistance, yet the benefit & largeness of his Progress, repair'd the little Glory he acquir'd in it. Sillaces was safely arriv'd in Parthia two Moons before my Prince could leave Media; which forc'd, and necessary continuance there, gave him time to settle that Kingdome, which his Passion otherwise would not have allowed him: And learning that his first Embassadors to Moneses were miscarried, he employ'd others, who passing successfully in their going, and return, through various Dangers, the very same day my Prince was beginning his so ambition'd Iourney, they presented him with this ensuing Letter, whose Address was as strange to him, as the Contents was to us.  in it I have found so serene a Felicitie, that all the trouble I am capable of in it, is an apprehension, you may suspect my Affection to my self, not to you, makes me present you with the Crown of Media. All the advantage I derive from the Gods confering it on me, is to evidence how little I value it, or how much I value you; believe me Artabbanes, I cannot better illustrate the greatness of both, than by resembling the one unto the other; I could almost ambition I were a friend unto Power, that by resigning it, I might manifest I am more so to you, who have so great a burthen to undergo, that the not beholding it, is none of the least blessings I promise my self in my retirement. 'Tis my ill Fate that I must pitie you in giving you Testimonies of my Affection, for 'tis the Miserie of Kings to derive their happiness from other Mens opinions, not their owne; the unlimitedness of their Power, makes their Failings, their Designes;  & renders them guiltie of not intending the best, as well as of not acting of it; you will be envy'd by all but your self, Mens ignorance will render you as unhappy, as your own knowledge; the Gods it seems being so intent on the infelicitie of Monarchs, that to effect it, they make contraries produce a resembling event: But though these be some of the inconveniencies of Government, yet the whole must suffer more for want of one, than any particular can by undergoing it; and he that knows the Troubles of a Crown, and yet dares wear one for his Countreys Good, may in the merit of the performance finde some kind of Antidote against the miseries which attends it: Fear nothing, but to do Injustice, then you will have this consolation, that what misfortunes you undergo, do not belong to the Person, but the function. Go Artabbanes and Rule a Nation, whilst I ambition but to rule my self; Give Lyndadorie your Affection, and Care, and the Gods give you as much happiness in the wearing a Crown, as they do me in the power of declining one.  This generous Letter was no sooner finish'd, than my Prince found how true the contents of it were, by loosing a Father the first hour of his putting on a Crown: He gave to that loss, those retributions which the best dispositions are capable of; And learning from those which brought him the occasion of his sadness, that Moneses was unalterable in his Resolves, & contemned the World, as much as now it courted him, as also that they had brought Letters thereof to the Nobilitie of Media, which too imported the resignation of his Crown to him, and his desires, and Commands to them, of accepting him for their King; He resolv'd to defer his Coronation, 'till things of a higher concernment were brought to some issue, and 'till he could present that Crown which was presented him, to hir who in his Iudgement better deserv'd it, and for which end only he rejoyced to have it. This new alteration suspended his journey, but it was only so long as the deputing the generous Zenophon Chief Governor in his absence did take up; so that the next morning, abandoning the Glories of a new Crown, and so many thousands of People who ambition'd to invest him in it, he set forwards for Parthia, only taking me with him, and both of us so disguis'd, that we were hardly knowable to each other. All the time of our long journey, my King entertain'd himself in Designes how to accomplish his Princess's Libertie, and if at any time he interrupted his owne silence, 'twas to communicate some stratagem to me, or to enquire if I had found out any worthy his knowledge. This being our only employment, we thought on so many Plots, that we hoped all of them would not be fruitless. We had alreadie so far conquer'd our Voyage, that we were come to the top of the Mountain Taurus, when from thence we might discover the adjacent Plain cover'd with Armed Troops; some of the wilde Inhabitants of the place from whence we took our Prospect, told us, they were Parthians, which was the utmost of their knowledge. Artabbanes therefore sent down one of the least irrationall amogst them to bring him a more clear informatio; This Messenger, about the break of Day return'd to us again, with this Assurance, that Two Parthian Princes, Sillaces, and Surena were joynt-Generalls of that vast Body, which was going to Fight the Roman Armie which lay near the City Chartes, and was commanded by one Crassus. This news surpriz'd us, and made us believe our Intelligencer was mistaken, by his joining Sillaces, and Surena in one Commission, which we concluded Orodes could never doe; but he was so possitive in his repeated Relation, that my Prince resolv'd to mingle himself with the Parthian Army (who were then pulling down their Tents for a March) and learn the Truth of what he had so much cause to doubt. This was not difficult for us to effect, for going a little aside in those Rude Places, 'till some of the first Troops were past us, we join'd the others without being suspected, or examined. We had not rid a Quarter of an Hour in that manner, when we perceiv'd the generous Sillaces riding from one Division to another, animating the Souldiers against the difficultie of the way, and making of them keep their Ranks as much as the illness of it would permit. Artabbanes thinking this was a fit time to disclose himself to his Friend, and to learn from him his own Fate in the fair Parthenissa's, tooke the opportunity to doe it, when he was gotten on a little height to view his Armies march, and only attended by a Couple of his Domesticks. Sillaces had well-nigh, at my Kings naming himself, discover'd who he was by a passionate embracing him, & 'twas with no small violence that he kept himself from doing it; but having sent on some employment those that were near him, and gotten into a retir'd Place, he there permitted his Arms to take with usury, what he had 'till then suspended them from. Here the generous Friends having finish'd that part of their entertainment, which might have bin dangerous if visible, and as troublesome if not performed, lest Sillaces absence might be observed, he put himself at the head of his Armie, where all out of respect kept themselves at so great a distance, that calling Artabbanes to him during that dayes March, they had ample and secure leasure to acquaint each other with what had happen'd since their separation; Sillaces, who knew my Kings impatiencie, told him, that at his return, Orodes had receiv'd him with large, and open demonstrations of affection, and with many acknowledgements for what he had acted for Tygranes, and against Merinzor; That he assiduously visited the fair Parthenissa, which both his dutie, and affection oblig'd him to, since that after hir escape out of the Isle of Eden, the Princess Lindadory and Zephalinda returned to Nineveh, and since Parthenissa's coming thither, they Three had bin inseparable; That Orodes continu'd his Passion for my Kings Mistris, with as much Violence, and unsuccessfulness as ever; that he was dayly more and more confirm'd in a confidence, that Surena had not extinguish'd his Flame for Parthenissa, but resign'd hir to Orodes, as being a less dangerous Ryvall; That the King of Parthia, being told of some misunderstanding between Surena and him, had publickly desir'd, and enjoyned their reconciliation; and to perfect it, had made them joynt-Generalls against Crassus, who having spent too-much time in robbing the Iews Temple at Ierusalem, was now come loaden with wealth, and Sacralidge, to invade Parthia, and was not distant above three dayes march; Lastly, the generous Sillaces told my Prince, that the fair Lindadory was constant in hir Blessings to him, which left him no shadow of fear, but that the King of Media would think (what he confest) that they were too-unworthily plac'd. The King of Media (said my Prince) thinks they are so justly, that if his Love to Lindadory were capable of accession, hir choyce & constancie would inspire it. Oh Gods! (reply'd Sillaces) am I then in so transcendent a condition? You are (said Artabbanes) if the Truth of what I tell you can make you so; and that you may no longer doubt it, Lindadory is at my dispose, and consequently at hir owne, & yours; Thereupon he told him of Moneses prefering a Solitude before a Crown, and of his having conferr'd that of Media upon him, with the care of his fair Sister. These extacies of Ioy made the March not tedious, though the way might have render'd it much so: This was the cause that before Sillaces thought the Sun had run half his course, he was near his set; Those therefore which were trusted with the Camping of the Armie, came to advertise him they had found a fit place for that end, and desir'd his orders; For he and Surena commanded the Armie by Dayes, after the Consullarie manner. Sillaces having viewed and elected a fit Camp for so large a Bodie, and given the requisite orders for that nights discipline, & securitie, withdrew himself to his Tent, that he might the better enjoy an entertainment, which he valued much, yet not more than it deserv'd to be so; but having the place emptied of all but Artabbanes, Surena came to visit, & acquaint him with a designe he had put in execution, of drawing Crassus out of the Straits, & Moutains of Ballissus, into the Plains of Mesopotamia, where the Parthian Horse would have an advantage, which gave him more than hopes of a Victory. I cannot tell you (said Symander) with what emotions and surprizes my King consider'd himself so near Surena, & how many times he had his hand upon his Sword, to demand a finall Reason of him for all those Miseries he had involv'd him in, & (which was much more sensible) the fair Parthenissa. But the respect he pay'd Sillaces, & the apprehensio he had, how great a hazard the Quarrell of his Coutry might run, by so unseasonable a decision of his own, which probably would engage an Armie too much against it self, that had already but too-much against it, suspended his resentments; but lest his Looks might one way occasion, what he had supprest in another, he withdrew himself 'till Surena by returning had left Sillaces alone, who told my Prince, that his Colleague had so well deluded the Roman Generall, by the Arts of Ariamnes, a Parthian of excellent dexterity in such negotiations, that Crassus elevated too by the fresh arrivall of Publius Crassus (his Son) with one Thousand men at Arms sent him by Iulius Caesar, had quitted the fast Countries where his Legions were invincible, and was marching so precipitately to the Plains of Cartes, which he had elected for the Generall Field, that if we make not hast, he will possess himself of all the advantages of it, before our arrivall, which makes us (continu'd Sillaces) resolve so to accelerate our march, that the Roman Courages by their attendance, shall not cool. This News stirr'd Artabbanes's bloud, and made him determine before he presented himself to his Princess, to let hir know the Arms with which Crassus had beaten him, were not by those of honor. Sillaces with raptures of joy, receiv'd this assurance, and could not doubt of the Victory, since my Prince would solicit, & Court it. In brief, two dayes after the Parthian & Roman Armie saluted each other by sight, but the day was so far spent, that they both concluded there would not be left enough for a decision, which would be so well disputed. That Night then was given to rest, and preparation for the ensuing Day, which no sooner dawn'd, than Surena, whose turn it was to Command, drew out his Armie, & the better to delude the Romans, he cover'd the Armour of his Men at Arms (which were all of pollisht Margian Steel) with the Skins of Beasts, which made Crassus say, he was going to a hunting, not a Battell; His right Wing was led by the generous Sillaces, who was accompany'd by my disguised Prince, richly Armed, and advantagiously mounted, but the first conceal'd by an obscure Coate; The Battell Surena led, and the left wing Vixores, who as his Brother, was restored to Orodes's favour. Publius Crassus had the conduct of the right wing of the Roman Armie, Marcus Crassus of the Battell, & Cassius of the left; The Nations of which these Armies were compos'd, was evident by the first encounter, which was so furious, and bloudy, that one might have concluded of the Progress, by the beginning. Publius Crassus routed Vixores's wing, whose Horse unfortunately going to the Charge, had render'd him uncapable of performing it; which fall, more inconvenient than dangerous, (for it but amaz'd him) gave Crassus not only the liberty of acting what he did, but also of hindering them from rallying; this unhappiness arriv'd at the same time, that Marcus Crassus gave a bloudy impressio on Surena's Battell, and so much disorder'd it, that Artabbanes casting off what cover'd the beauty, and richness of his Armor, flew where his Courage, and conduct were but too-necessary. His first relief was given to his Ryvall, who 'till it came, fought more in despair, than hope; but my King having metamorphos'd his condition, went to relieve Vixores's Troops, who were both the Romans Chase, and Quarrie. The heat he was in, made him lift up his Helmet, which being shaded with Carnation Plumes, brought so large an accession to his naturall good meen, that those which beheld it, were as much pleas'd with it, as with his assistance; which he then affoarded those of that routed wing, by heading a small partie, with which despising all Enemies, but the Chiefest, addrest his main charge, to the young Crassus, who at the head of his Troops, he kill'd with his owne hands; and some Parthians according to their barbarous custome, cutting off his head, and carrying it on the point of a Launce, it brought as much Terror to his Partie, as so lately it had success. This was the first dawning of the glorious event which that day shin'd upon the Parthians; and this was so generously follow'd by him which begun it, that though some fatall wounds he receiv'd in the Triumvir's owne Battalion, render'd him uncapable of finishing what he had made so large a Progress in, yet the Victorie remain'd entirely to the Parthians, by which you may imagin how far he had advanc'd it, when they could conclude it without him. In that bloudie day my Prince so repair'd the wrongs of Treachery, that he wanted nothing of an entire satisfaction, but that Crassus knew not, he had done so. The generous Sillaces, who with his sword had made many wayes to Glorie, in the pursuing of it, receiv'd from me the fatall Newes, that my King was able no longer to doe so, which made him abandon all designes, but those of returning to serve Artabbanes; whom I had carryed into his Tent, where he found him in a condition too-too-sufficient to cloud, and make him deplore that dayes success; For alas the turning of the bloud after the dressing of his wounds had cast him into a swound, which Sillaces had like to have accompany'd him in; But the Gods by restoring him to himself, did the like to his generous Friend, who gave such signall demonstrations of Ioy for that blessing, that had not the high performances of my Prince that day, render'd them only upon that score legitimate, by the greatness of the effects, those which were present, might have judged to whom they were payd. But Sillaces, that he might not be separated from Artabbanes, sent Surena word, that some hurts render'd him uncapable of prosecuting the success, which therefore he left entirely to his Care; neither indeed was this an absolute fiction, for he had receiv'd Five wounds, yet none so dangerous as to have produced that detention which a nobler impediment did. In this great day there fell above 20000 Romans, and the next we learn'd, that Surena by many slights had first gotten Marcus Crassus out of the Citie of Charres, & then into his Power, by promises of Life to him, and his remaining Armie, if they would embrace Orodes's mercy. Though the Roman Souldiers forced their Generall to this, yet he repayd their great Crime, with a proportionate Generositie; For as he was going to Surena, turning about, and addressing his speech to some Patricians, he told them; If any of you, O Romans, survive this ruine, tell the Senate, 'twas not my Souldiers necessitated me to go into the Parthians hands, but my Fate, which being confident to receive from them, I go to embrace with joy, as believing my bloud will prove a Ransome for the rest of my Countrey-men, who, if they saw me die by my owne hands, might have as much provocation to imitate, as they will have to revenge me. These words, when contrary ones were both deserved and expected, drew Tears into many Eyes, and drew Octavius & Petronius along with their Generall, who as the Romans say, being brought before Surena, was immediately murther'd with those which accompany'd him; and as we say, some high language passing between Surena and him, Octavius drew his Sword to vindicate the Triumvir, which occasion'd all their Deaths: howsoever it was Crassus's head was cut off and sent to Orodes. I may not omit (continu'd Symander) to let you know, that the Parthians, who had unanimously observed they deriv'd their Glory from the ubiquitie, of the Courage & conduct of one, whose good Meen, and Arms render'd him also exceeding remarkable, came to Surena, and implor'd the sight of their Deliverer; which he also acknowledging him to be, to satisfie Iustice and Them, made a diligent but fruitless enquirie after my Prince; but this ignorance of whom he was, and where to finde him, conferr'd on him an honor greater than their knowledge of both, would have produced; For the admirable effects of his Courage, his abandoning them when they no longer needed it, & the declining of a Glorie, which no Mortall could have so great a resignation as not to owne, led some of them to think, it might be the Tutelary Angel of Parthia: This particular opinion being publish'd, became the generall Faith, in the dictates whereof, collecting together all the combustible Arms of the Romans, the Parthian Armie, casting themselves into a Ring, set Fire to the Pile, and accompany'd the ascension of the Flame with loud shouts of acknowledgements, and Gratitude to his residence, who was the cause of both. This high retribution of the Parthians to my Prince's Valour (whose ignorance could not render them so much as suspected of partialitie, and whose enjoying the benefit of it, made them the more competent Iudges of its greatness) brought not near so much satisfaction to him, as his wounds (which render'd him uncapable of paying his Dutie to his Princess) did the contrary. The generous Sillaces gave him all the consolation he was capable of, by begging him to believe, the Glory of the Cause ought to appologize for the effect, & would even in Parthenissa's owne judgement, though perhaps not in hir affection. My Prince, who protested it could doe it in neither of his, conjur'd Sillaces, to return with Surena to Selutia, there to receive, and participate in a Tryumph, which he deserv'd entirely to engrosse, and to supervize their mutuall affairs; as also to have a Care lest this accessio of Glory to Surena, might not thrust him into attempts, which Sillaces himself was of opinion he wanted but the Power & opportunity to undertake. That generous Prince, who by this time (which was fifteen dayes after the Battell of Charres) found Artabbanes in a mending condition, & himself in a travelling one, obey'd Artabbanes's incessant solicitations, having first receiv'd a reitterated assurance of his following him as soon as he was able; he would have also left him some trusty Domesticks, but my Prince would detaine none but a Chyrurgion, of whose fidelity he was as confident, as of his Skill. Sillaces & Surena being gone to Selutia, we transported Artabbanes from the Camp into a Neighbour Village, where there was less ill-accommodacion than in the Field, & where we remained two Moons before he thought himself in a posture fit to make use of a Horse; During our residence there we heard frequently from Sillaces, whose letters were still confirmations of his beleiving Surena had silenc'd but not extingush'd his Passion, and that that was Orodes's Faith as well as his, who therefore seem'd to be more troubl'd than pleas'd at his success, and who every day disclos'd some such symptomes of his being not well satisfied with him, that it was generally thought those signes would turn into effects, which Surena's high Carriage would not a little contribute to the accellerating. Artabbanes, who knew Surena had almost as much discretion as Love, concluded he would not so far incense his King, as that it should be publickly taken notice of, unless he were prepar'd for some high Designe, and sought but a provocation to begin it. This rationall belief, put the possesor of it upon an irrationall resolution, that of beginning a Iourney to Selutia, before he was well able to walk in his Chamber, and against the advice and Prayers of the Chyrurgion, who protested it would at least more than hazard a Relapse, longer than his first indisposition: But my King, though he were deaf to us, yet after his first dayes journey, he could not be so to his Pain & weakness, both which told and made him believe what he would not from us. And indeed his Indisposition was so great, & so long like to continue so, that we removed him to a private Country-house that we then were in, being too-common of itself, and seated in a Roade that was so. Artabbanes's removall from his first residence, and his then taking so retir'd a One, made him justly apprehend he should be deny'd the satisfaction of his Friends Intelligences; he therefore comanded me to go to Selutia to acquaint Sillaces with his removall, and perfectly to learn all the transactions & intrecacies of the Court, which he said he thought could no way be safelyer nor better effected, than by employing me. To obey this Command immediatly I tooke Post, and upon the Third Day towards the Close of the Evening, I came to the end of my Iourney; but as I past along the Streets to a Friends House, whom I durst only, and whom I did entirely trust, I saw strange murmuring Crouds of People, and amongst others so deep a consternation, that I concluded 'twas no common Cause which had so extraordinary a productio. On my arrivall at my Friends, whom I happily found at home, I enquir'd what created these unusuall effects. He was as much surpriz'd at my Question, as I was at his Answer, which was, That Orodes having assum'd some high Iealousies of Sutena, either upon a score of Love or Power, had that Day seized on him; and after a short hearing & Sentence, had but even then put him to Death, which so strange and sudden a proceeding was the the cause of those unusuall Crouds in the Citie, the very Commonalty admiring the vicissitude of Fortune, which in few hours produced so strange a Revolution, that he for whom so recently Scaffolds were built to behold his triuphs, now had some to behold his Execution; Neither is this the only cause of what you enquire the reason of, since 'tis firmly reported, that even in this momet Orodes is forcing a Felicity from Parthenissa, which hir Constancy has so resolutly deny'd him; But this is so improbable a Crime, that many believe 'tis divulg'd by Surena's Partizans, to make his Martyrdom appear the clearer, and the more certainly to have it reveng'd. You may believe I was not a little surpriz'd at this relatio, which the more I reflected on, the more I found cause to conclude, that the latter part of it was true, because the former was; and that Arsaces would not so precipitate his Favorites Execution, but for an end which was more considerable than that loss; and I knew nothing could appear so to him, but the satisfaction of his Flame. 'Twas therefore, that hastily abandoning my Friend, I went up so to the Palace, resolving by my owne Death, or by Orodes's, to prevent a misfortune I much more justly apprehended than either: But oh Gods! as soon as I came within the Guards of the Court, I found them melting in Tears, from whence I concluded, 'twas some strange thing which had so proportionate an influence; This generall grief produced so generall a neglect of all things but of the celebrating it, that without so much as being question'd, I came (by the knowledge I had of all the Palace) to Parthenissa's Anti-Chamber, from whence I heard in the Room where she lay, so many, and so high evincements of sorrow, that I concluded, that which then invaded me, was but too-justly grounded. The first operatios of mine being a little mittigated, I took the confidence to look into that sad Chamber. But Great Gods! I had no sooner done so, than I fell into it, my spirits abandoning me at the sight of the fair Parthenissa's being dead on a Couch, & Zephalinda by hir. The fair Emilia too, with dishevell'd hair, drown'd eyes, & wringed hands, acting grief so passionately, that I concluded 'twas more easie for hir to have bin dead, than to live in a Misfortune which render'd the being so, so necessarie. The noyse I made in my Fall, made some of the Princesses women run to learn from whence it proceeded; one of them in Charitie, flinging some water on my Face, wash'd off that colour with which I was disguis'd, & thereby discover'd who I was, having formerly known me; My sences being return'd, she that had bin my Physician went and told the disconsolate Emilia of my being there, who in a languishing Pace came towards me, and with a voice which was so, told me; At length Symander, at length the Gods have wearied themselves with having persecuted a Virtue as great as the Crueltie which has done it, and made the Tyrant Arsaces know, that when they denie a sanctuarie to Innocence, Death will affoard it one: His not believing this Truth, hath forc'd the Divine Parthenissa to act it, the effects of whose high Constancie for your Prince, is yet clouded by a performance of the fair Zephalinda, who thought Death so unconsiderable, if it came in competition with hir Friendship, that not to have the last suspected, she has embrac'd the first. Here the fair Emilia's sighes performed what they had so often attempted, I mean cut off hir relation, which yet was as efficatiously continu'd by hir Tears, which spake both the sadness of the Storie, and evidenc'd what was due unto it. The faithfull Symander, at the rememberance and repetition of these fatall Passages, so sympathiz'd in the grief of which he was making a description, that it hinder'd him from continuing it, which was a performance, both Artavasdes and Callimmachus could not condemne, because they sympathiz'd in it. It was almost a quarter of an hour, before the Auditors could beg the Speaker's continuance of his Narration, or that he could obey them, which at length he thus did: My impatience (said Symander) was too-high to continue any longer ignorant of the Cause of our Loss, especially when what was the impediment, as to me, was the aggravation of it; I did therefore conjure the fair Emilia to acquaint me, by what strange wayes the Gods had effected so strange an end: To which she told me; Arsaces, since the delivering up of Parthenissa to him by Surena, so augmented in his Passion, and she in hir Resolves of declining to reward it, that many foresaw such extreams could not but produce proportionate effects. The News of the Romans defeat divesting Orodes of Fear, Desire took so absolute an Empire over him, that in the criminall dictates of his, he so importunately prest the Princess to reward his Flame by a Hymeneall Crown, that she declining it, he vow'd by all the oathes his fury could invent, that if in five dayes she alter'd not hir inclination, he would satisfie his, in a way so fatall, that she should be convinc'd; 'twas not for want of Power, that he so advantagiously perswaded hir to his Bed. This he esteem'd a modest warning, for amongst his Domesticks he solemnly protested, he would have that by force, which he could not by composition; and to evidence this was his resolution, immediatly he sent all his Guards to inviron the Princess Appartment with this strict injunction, that none without a license under his owne hand (but hir meniall Servants) upon pain of Death should speak with hir; and lest hir resolution might frustrate the designes of this, he permitted not any Instrument which could act Death to be either in hir, or any of hir Domesticks power. Three dayes of the five were expir'd in the punctuall observance of his Orders, when towards the Evening the Princess Zephalinda, by the permission of the Guards, came into Parthenissas Chamber, and after she had acquainted hir with hir Friendship, & hir own sad condition by hir Tears, she told hir; The permission, Madam, I have obtain'd of paying you this duty, is upon a score I am so far from making use of, that could I fancy you capable of listening to it, I would employ it to an opposite end; for Arsaces, but upon the pretence of my coming to solicite you to be his Queen, would not have permitted it; I was forced to promise what I never intended to perform, though it is probable, by that Friendship he knows I pay Artabbanes, which too it may be he mistakes for a Passion, he thought my interest concurring with his in depriving you of that generous Prince, might render me a fit Agent for such an end, but that, Madam, of my coming to wait on you, is to know which way I may prevent it; there is no difficulty which my Zeal will not deprive of that Name, & I shall finde none in my own condition but to live to behold you any's, but his. This generous declaration (Emilia continu'd) had a proportionate retribution, and this further Answer; I have not, fair Zephalinda, so misimploy'd the time of my confinement, as not to consider 'tis secur'd with so much force, & care, that I am not now to seek an election, but how to act mine; your assistance in which is the only, and the highest obligation you can confer either on Artabbanes, or me: I finde abstinence is a Sanctuary I cannot reach; If I had known it earlier what I am fully convinc'd of now, I should not have implor'd from you so dangerous an obligation; but my ignorance which causes this Desire, will I hope procure your Pardon for my making it; and my condition will invite you to grant a request, which you cannot deny, without being accessary to a guilt, nothing can equall but your Repentance for not having prevented it. Madam (said Zephalinda, in a Floud of Tears) I conjure you to suspend any violence against your Life, 'till my next visit, which shall doubtless present you with your deliverance, or with the power to act it. I will obey you (Parthenissa reply'd) but remember if you violate this engagement, you assume Arsaces's Crimes. Which if I doe (she answer'd) may I suffer the punishment due unto them. Zephalinda immediatly left us, and from the time she did so, 'till hir return (which was the Morning of the last day) Parthenissa employ'd it all, in finding some expedient to extinguish hir Life, should hir Friend, by some strange accidet be hinder'd from bringing of hir one; and at length elected that fatall, and only remedy, of stoping hir breath with hir Linen, which by the Countenance Zephalinda put on at hir then entrance, she concluded would be absolutely necessary; & in those resolves she told hir; I observe (Madam) by the sence you have of my condition, that Death only can change it, the necessity of the performance will I hope invite the Gods to pardon it, they would not leave me but one way to avoid a transcendent sin, if that it self were a proportionate one; a Martyr acts his owne Death, and yet thereby acquires that glorious Title; My affection for Artabbanes, has bin confirmed by as many vowes, as my zeal has bin to the Gods, who might too justly suspect I would decline these, were I capable of declining those; I alleadge not these reasons to confirm my self in my resolution, but you; that you may receive as much consolation in the Cause, as I shall in the acting of it. These fatall words were deliver'd with much less emotion, than they were heard with; and the Divine Princess evidenc'd the certainty she had of another Life, by the little disorder she resented at the abandoning of this. The fair Zephalinda having silenc'd hir Tears, and sighs (too-just retributions not to be repay'd either to Parthenissa's condition, or the resolution with which she bore it) thus reply'd; Since I last had the misfortune of leaving you, time has bin strangely active, & if I gave you any hopes of your deliverance, 'twas because I had assum'd some pregnant ones of it. For Surena, who had some few Dayes past taken up a firm belief, that Orodes would more than solicite your affectio, began some private leavies of Men to prevent it, which Arsaces having discover'd either by intelligence, or by the probabilitie of the thing, took so short a space for the reception of your positive Answer, that it prevented your intended relief, with that certaintie with which it was design'd; yet when I informed my Brother, of the Kings resolution, and yours, in the Dictates of Rage, and Pitie, he went to him, and told him, with a Countenance which spake his heart, as much as his words did; When I resign'd up the Princess Parthenissa to you, 'twas Sir upon rearms you confin'd your self to by so many solemne, and reitterated vowes, that though it be the common Faith you intend to violate them, yet it cannot be mine, 'till it be confirm'd by your owne avowing it. Arsaces, who had then but one of his Domesticks about him, & who judged by Surena's Countenance, and abrupt Question, he was in a temper fit to attempt any thing that was desperate, if your condition appear'd to be so, return'd him this Answer; I believe so manys assuming that Faith, proceeds from the as many knowers of Partheissa's usage of me, which is such, that it may with too much reason perswade them to believe I am sooner capable of any thing, than of such a neglect. I hope Sir (Surena reply'd) though this may be other Mens belief, yet it is not your resolution; for that sacred contract you made with me, was not conditionall, but absolute; so that no ill usage of hirs to you, can render legitimate a resembling return of yours to hir; The knowledge I had of your Passion, and of the impossibilitie of hir receiving, & rewarding it, made me intently carefull to leave you no way of violating your engagement, but by violating your oathes, which will raise more to revenge such a performance, than your Power can to hinder it. This resolute, and true reply, so insenc'd the cruell Orodes, who (by the then coming into the Room of many of his Guards, and Courtiers, to learn the result of their meeting) now no more apprehended to disclose what he was confident could not be prevented, & which he only fear'd the discoverie of, upon that score, told my Brother with a furious Look, and Tone; Traytor, that canst have reason enough to make thy Kings actions appear as Crimes, and wantest it, when thy own are more undeniablly so. The Tyes thou hast to Parthenissa, are but accidentall, & those thou hast to me, are naturall, yet in thy late Rebellion, thou couldst with lesser scruple violate thy alleagiance, than thou now reprochest me with violating my Promise. Thou didst in thy performance, leave me a latitude for the acting of mine, and canst not reproch me but with that for which thou art my Example: Nay, that Contract thou hast so often mention'd, and by which thou wouldst tye my hands, sets them at libertie, especially to the punishing of Thee, for having attempted it; For 'twas thy Rebellion gave thee that seeming Power, of making one of my Vassals confine me from acting my pleasure upon another; now that force being dissolv'd, by which thou didst this Crime, I have much more reason to punish thy having extorted such a promise, than thou hast to demand the performing of it, since I but assume a Power I indisputably had before thy Treason eclips'd it, but thou canst not exact the performance of a forc'd engagement, but thou must remember what thou didst to procure it, and that will vindicate me for not observing it; Thou, by cancelling the first obligation, hast taught me to punish thee in the repetition of thy Fault, and by making force to be justice, thou hast render'd that Art which destroys Thine, to be much more so. Surena sencibly wounded with this language, reply'd; You reproch me Sir with your own fault, for 'twas you, not I which cancell'd the first obligation, and though this was but then evident to a few, yet by what you have since menaced the fair Parthenissa with, you have render'd it now so to all, and made my performance as clear to the World, as it was then to me. The obligations between you, and your subjects are mutuall, they promise you obedience, and you then protection; you then first broke you engagement, before I did mine, and I never drew my sword against you, but to keep you from a greater Crime, than that it self was; and though you alleadge my confinement to you is naturall, and to the fair Parthenissa accidentall, yet when you consider upon what score I ty'd my self to hir Interests, you will finde it was deriv'd from a Duty, unto which that you challenge, is much subordinate. 'Tis the duty I owe the Gods, and that obliges me more to preserve the Innocent, than my Birth does to obey you; especially when your Comands are of a Quality that carry in my disobedience, the justification of it; Whilst you govern'd with in your Laws, I gave you that observance due to you in them, and was more prodigall of my blond to defend and increase your Power, than when you misimploy'd it, I was to oppose it; Nay, after you were seemingly converted, I brought you home a Victory from a people that hardly ever knew what it was to lose one; I was in hope the Gods, by shewing how successfull my Sword was for you, would have invited you to Actions which it can only be employ'd in; But I now fear you will render me unavoydably guilty; For drawing my Sword against you, for hir, cannot render me more criminall in your esteem, than the not doing it, will render me so in the Iudgement of the Gods, and of Men. Here (continu'd Zephalinda) Arsaces's fury was uncapable of a longer silence, which made him interrupt Surena, by saying; Traytor, Thou hast not only the wickedness to run into a Rebellion, but to declare that performance a greater Duty, than the not having acted it; That Power which thou shalt know, and feel is absolute, thou wouldest make conditionall, that it might not punish thee; but that Sin thou shalt be convinc'd is one, even in the punishment of it; & because thou alleadgest thou never drew'st thy Sword against me, but to keep me from a higher Crime than that it self was; I will repay thy kindness in the imitation of it, & by thy Death hinder thee from a greater Sin than the commanding of it is: yes, I will punish in thy intended Rebellion, what thou tyedst me from in thy acted Rebellion; and the Gods who knew how unjust that concession was thou extortedst from me, involve thee in new Crimes, that thou might'st be rewarded for the old; My Iustice only is clouded with this misfortune, that thou hast but a single Life to appease it with, since thy relapse deserves the deprivation of that, and consequently thy first Sin will continue unpunisht. Orodes, at the end of these words, turn'd to the Captain of his Guards, and commanded him to seize on Surena, who seeing his Life was lost, and consequently yours, or your Honor, resolv'd whilst it lasted to act some such performace as might repair the shortness of it, and the length of those Miseries it had so unfortuatly involved you in; Therefore as the Captain of the Guards came to take his Sword, he drew it, and past it through his Body; then crying out to Arsaces, you shall go with me, Sir, into another world to learn this great truth, that to kill you is a less Sin, than that you intend against Parthenissa, or the permiting it; he ran furiously at him, & though so many hands endeavour'd to stop him, yet all they could doe, was to put his thrust so much aside, as that what was intended to the Body, only pierc'd his Clothes. Surena more troubl'd that he had mist his design, than at the punishment he knew attended his having assum'd it, was returning, and though with a fury but equall to his former, yet certainly had had a superior success, when all that were present flew upon him, & forced his Sword out of that hand, which if any longer left, had doubtless acted a greater piece of Iustice, than the Guards did in preventing it; and that which so much contributed to this easie Victory, was the deepe consternation amongst those few Friend of Surena's which were present, who not fancying he would have put things to so precipitate, and high an issue, fell into an amazement, which prov'd as fatall to him, as if it had bin their Treachery. The pale & trembling Arsaces, observing Surena was disarm'd, and that some of his Guards were going to revenge his danger, and their Captains Death, by the acting of Surena's, cry'd out to them; Hold, I command you on your Lives not to touch him, for the inflicting of a sudden Death will relish more of Passion than of Iustice; & his Crimes make him a fitter Sacrifice for the last, than the first. Then commanding a Gentleman (who he made in that instant Captain of his Guards in the room of him that had freshly lost that office with his Life) to look to Surena as he would answer it with the loss of his own; he forthwith gave order for a Scaffold to be erected before the Palace Gates, and solemnly protested, that on it, before the Sun set, Surena should lose his Life. He heard these last words as he was carrying away, and therefore turning about with a Countenance altogether quiet and serene, he told Arsaces, I thank you Sir, and I conjure you to keep your vowes; for the next satisfaction to the prevention of Parthenissa's dishonor, is not to survive it: Arsases only reply'd by a shaking of his head, and by a second Command having made Surena to be carried away, forthwith sent to the chief Tribunal of Iustice in Selutia, to sit and condemn him. This order was no sooner publish'd, but a Proclamation was also, that whosoever appear'd in the Streets with Arms (except those of the Guard) should die without Mercie, & those that any way related to Surena, which were found in Selutia after the expiration of one hour, should be lyable to the same penaltie. This so precipitate and brisk a proceeding with the securing of Surena's person, and the placing of Souldiers in every convenient Post, so terrified those Partizans of his alreadie in the Town, that wanting a Head to employ their swords, they payd an exact obedience to the Proclamation, and involv'd such of their Companions as they met coming to Selutia in the same crime; Surena therefore was tamely brought before his Iudges, before who he only would say, that all the ill he was guiltie of, was, that he had not acted what they were condemning him for having attempted. This short reply made the Tryall the like, so that immediately he was adjudg'd to lose his head, and by Orodes's command, who all the while was present, was sent to the Scaffold to have the Sentence perform'd. This advertisement being brought me, I went to the cruell King, not to beg Surena's Life, but only the permission of seeing him lose it: Arsaces granted my Request, either not to disoblige his pretended Solicitress, or to punish my being so, in the sight of so fatall a spectacle; I found my poor Brother on the Scaffold, who seeing me there, assum'd a joy I thought his condition uncapable of, but I soon observ'd from whence it proceeded, for immediately he told me; You see Sister, I am now going to lose my Life for hir to whom I had given it, and if the now cause of my Death could but extinguish the just provocations she has had so often to wish it, I should esteem it at a higher rate than she can deplore the loss of it. Tell her, I conjure you, that with joy I embrace my present condition, since I consider it as inflicted on me for having obstructed hir desires, and from thence I cannot but conclude, that since the Gods so exemplarily punish a Passion which never had any other designe than to be voluntarily approv'd of, and rewarded; they will doubtlessly act much more to the magnifying of their Iustice, upon a Flame which alreadie is burnt into desires of Lust; and they will as certainly perform it while Arsaces's desires are but desires; lest if once they were turned into action, they might be as uncapable of a fit punishment, as he of a resembling sin. Conjure hir, Zephalinda, to make this use of my Death, that it may bring both hir and me a satisfaction, which it may be any other way will be deny'd to both. I confess the Gods have made me so miserable, that all my performances have hitherto evidenc'd my adoration was not a debt to hir, but to my self; I do therefore beg you by that Friendship & Relation which is between us, and by my last Breath, that upon my score you will pay hir all the services you are any wayes capable of; that one of the Family may in some degree repair the Sins of him that was the chief of it; that Parthenissa may thereby know (what my unfortunate performances have not clearly manifested) that my Care of hir, was for hir, which I hope she will not doubt of while I lived, since the effects of it will continue when I am dead. My last request is, if ever you see the generous Artabbanes, beg him, when he remembers what I have done, that he would also remember what 'twas invited it; and then he cannot judge the fault greater, than the inducement to it; he will be too generous to hate me in my Grave, and I more than hope his resentments will die with the object of them. Surena having thus spoken, embrac'd me, and took his eternall leave. Then going to the other extreamity of the Scaffold, he conjur'd the People to prevent their Kings Sin, since they could not but participate in the punishment of it; for the Gods would consider every accessary as a Principle, and esteem those as guilty which hinder'd not Parthenissa's dishonor, as him that acted it. This was all he said to them, left a longer discourse might have bin interrupted. His Soul after she had thus disburthen'd hir self seem'd to have more than a knowledge of those happy Fields whither she was taking hir eternall flight; for when he was laying down his Life, he did it with much more resolution, that he had that took it from him, who perform'd it by separating the Head from the Body at one stroak. The Spectators at that fatall blow, gave one common groan, and by killing the Executioner, shew'd how much they detested the Execution. Their Grief too had not contented it self with so mean a Sacrifice, had not Orodes in person at the head of a thousand of his Guards, come, and by killing some of the Multitude disperst the rest. The poor Surena's Body I carry'd away with me. in the same Charriot I came in, and lay'd it in the Sepulchre of our Family. Here (said Emilia) the fair Zephalinda's weepings put a period to hir words, in which just duty, the sad Parthenissa kept hir such faithfull Company, that one might have concluded she reserved no Tears for hir own misfortune she gave so many on Surena's. Happy Surena, that in one single performance couldst so efface the Crims of thy Life, as to have the deprivation of it so nobly deplor'd, and even by hir which had most reason to rejoyce at it. The first that interrupted the silence, though not the weeping, was Parthenissa, who told Zephalinda; I have (Madam) bin so unfortunate to your Family, that if you will not grant me on the score of Charity, the means of that Death which I implor'd, confer it on me at least on that of Revenge, my misfortune and my condition doe equally require it; and you cannot in the performance more oblige your resentment, than you will me. It may be that the greatest misfortune Surena relish'd at his Death, was that he left me behinde, and the eminent danger too he concluded I was involv'd in by Arsaces's lust. The extinction of my Life, will also redress those apprehensions in him, and it may be affoard him a proportionate joy, when I shall carry him the News how faithfully you have observ'd his desires. 'Tis not Madam (said Zephalinda) upon these invitations I am come to pay you my engagement, 'Tis upon your own and Artabbanes's accompt that I doe it; for I finde your condition is uncapable of all remedy, but by that which will in the future exempt you from needing any other; thereupon taking out a little Viall, she presented it to Parthenissa, with more Tears than would have fill'd it, and told hir; In this Madam, you will finde that Sanctuary the Gods have deny'd your virtue, which I should have offer'd you sooner, But that my Brothers Physician, who composed it, was so near Death himself at the hearing of Surena's, that he could not earlier give me this effect of his Art; He assures me it is of a nature so subtle, that it conquers the vitalls, as soon as it touches them, and will affoard you as little pain in the operation, as you will resent after it. This is a present, (said the fair Parthenissa, wipeing away hir Tears and kissing it) which I have too-little time remaining to acknowledge sufficiently; but if in the other World our Condition admits the paying of services, I will present you with those there, which mine here denyes me the power of retributing; and as a signall earnest of this Truth, I leave you the generous Artabbanes as a Legacy; she deserues him best, that does most for him, & you in this last performance have so clearly done so, that the very Partie is also the judge, and acknowledger of it. You that when the Gods cannot preserve Parthenissa fit for him, can doe it, doe become more so your self, and it may be those Powers had no other way but this, to absolve Artabbanes's Constancy from becoming so much his punishment, as to prefer Parthenissa before Zephalinda, who in all perfections is as much my superior, as in a perfect Flame I am at least hir Equall. The fair Zephalinda was about to reply, when one I had plac'd to discover when Arsaces was coming, came runing in to tell me so, which set a period to the discourse they were engag'd in, and made Parthenissa uncover the little Glass, and say; 'Tis now no time to think of any thing, but by Death to prevent what is much more to be fear'd; with these words in a moment she drank the fatall Poyson, with a Constancie great as our Grief; I was (continued Emilia) so drowned in Tears & sorrow, that though the fair Parthenissa spake many things as remarkable as her very performance, yet all I can remember she said, was, a deploring the Invitation of hir death; which was such, that hir hate for the infamous Arsaces, might seem to have an equall share in it, to that of hir Passion and Constancie for your Prince. Zephalinda in the mean time went to a window, as if it had bin to discover how near Orodes was; but alas it was more undisturbedly to pledge Parthenissa in a resembling liquor, which as soon as she had perform'd, she return'd to hir, but with a serener countenance, than that with which she had left hir; and holding up the emptie Violl, told hir; This, Madam, will be my witness, that I serv'd not my self, but you, in acting, what the Gods had left you but one way to perform. Your virtues shine so clear, that whilst I have them for my Guides, I can neither be mistaken in the way to felicitie, nor the end; and though this be a high Truth, yet it cannot Transcend this other. That the obliging Poyson I have drunk, will not more certainly make me wait on you now, than the beholding of Artabbanes's Grief, would have made me do it hereafter, when it may be the Then performance, would have relish'd, of what the now will absolve me of I had look'd like your Murtherer, not your Friend, had I not thus waited on you, so that what my Inclination leads me unto, my Reason and my Interest do; which are Inducements that none can condemne, with so much Iustice as that with which I obey them. The fair Parthenissa, for a while only in Tears & in embraces acknowledged the disobligingness and gallantrie of this performance, in which latter Zephalinda held her company so strictly, that I thought they would prove as unseparable to each other, as misfortune had bin to both. She which last drank the Poyson was the first that spake, and to the best of my rememberance, these were hir words; Having now payd the lust and Antedated sacrifice of our Tears to Artabbanes's condition, when he shall be inform'd of ours, let us absolutely in the future silence them, lest the Tyrant should ascribe ours, to his being one; and thereby, though he be actually deny'd the Triumph of his Love, he imaginarily possesses that of his Revenge. The Cruell Arsaces, said Parthenissa, cannot so Transcendently delude himself, as to ascribe my Tears to his being so to me, when he sees what the fair Zephalinda has done, which is of such a Qualitie, that he will find his Triumph, though we are never so intent to cloud it; for I am resolved he glories as much in the destruction of Virtue, as of Feminine Honor; so that what my resolutio has deny'd him in the Latter, yours has conferr'd on him in the Former. Had I bin single in my suffering, I should have retrencht from him that Victorie; for to have bin Deny'd his hopes, would have as much eclips'd his satisfaction, as the Destroying of Innocence, and Constancie would have created it. I may, said Zephalinda, as justly alleadge, he is not the cause of my Tears, since a Death which I esteem so transcendent a misfortune, as to believe the acting of my owne after it, is a less one than to survive it, may well peculiarize my Weepings to that solearie cause: But whilst we continue ours, he may at least have some shadow for Insulting, whereas if we intirely silence them, and in their Place assume an unclouded serenitie, he may consider the Way in which we evade his Power, to be as sublime a Trouble as the End. Here the fair Zephalinda was interrupted by the arrivall of two of Arsaces Guard, whom he had sent to clear Parthenissa's Chamber, of all, but hir self; These barbarous Men could not terrifie those whom Death did not; all the effect they produc'd, was a Ioy that their sanctuarie was so near, and certain, and that they had so timely resolv'd upon it, that the burning Lust of the Tyrant, could not be more surely a sin, than that thereby they had put him out of the Capasitie of acting it. To render that yet the more so, Parthenissa began to protract the time, that the Fatall poyson might conquer so much of hir Life, as to exempt hir as well from the beginings, as conclusions of Orodes's Insolence, by reasoning with these infamous undertakers of a resembling imployment. And though what had begun, too-pregnantly evinc'd the teper of their Souls, yet the Eloquence of innocence conspiring with the sight of so many admirable and groing Beauties, which were so near an eternall fading, operated so efficatiously, that they retir'd (dissolving into Tears) unto their King, & acquainted him with the cause thereof, which alas was so far from having a proportionate Influence on Him, that what had converted them into water, turn'd him into Fire: For Iudging of the Cause by the production, they could not assume a higher Pitty, that those Beauties were to be gathered, than he did a satisfaction that he was to gather them; Nay, his Reason was so obscur'd, that he concluded they wept not that such perfections were to be Enjoy'd, but only that They were not to doe it; so that having given them an high reprehension, for what deserv'd the contrary, he went hastily to Parthenissa's Chamber, in whose countenance there was less disturbance, then in his; which being a truth as visible, as the occasion was not (at least as to him) he told her; At length Madam, I hope the greatness of my Flame, & perseverance, has obtain'd a Victory, which cannot be higher in it self, than my desires were of it; and your Face gives me a satisfaction which nothing can hardly augment, but your words giving me the same assurance which your Looks doe. If my Looks Sir (said the Princess) gives you any other assurance than my Words have still done, they hold no correspondence with my Heart; so that either you are mistaken in my Looks, or my Looks in me. If (said Arsaces) I am mistake in the signes of my Felicity, I am certain I will not be so in the fruitions of it; & what the Power of my Love cannot act, that of my Authority shall; Yet I must confess I much rather ambition to derive my happiness from the former, than the latter; and therefore I again prostrate at your Feet my Crown, as well as Liberty; either deserves the retribution, I but implore for both, your denying me my right, authorizes me to take it, and therefore you render force legittimate, if you necessitate me to it; My Passion is as uncapable of Delay, as Change, and had my Promise given you a longer time to forme your Resolution, my love must have contracted it; so that I am come to know my Fate, which cannot admit of the least suspension, because my Life cannot, if now deny'd that alone, which can give it a relish, as well as continue it an existence; In short Madam, this is the hour I must receive, or take my Felicity, & the Gods have as little the Power, as I, of altering this Resolve. I know (said Parthenissa) you will be as much mistaken in your hopes, as you have bin in the signes of them. The Gods could not call themselves the Protectors of Innocence, & refuse a Sanctuary to mine; Know Cruell Arsaces, I have one above your Power to violate, which it was high time to assertain, when what should have bin the cure of your Lust, you consider'd as an Authority to act it; know further, I despise your Crown, and Death to avoyd it; which is a Resolution I might derive from a double cause; for had not my Constancy bin prevalent enough to ingage me to assume it, your usage would be; which cannot with more necessity invite me to that performance, than I will act it with Ioy. The degenerate Arsaces believing Parthenissa had some fatall Weapon in hir power, that thus Authoriz'd hir to threaten an enraged King (for he knew hir too-well, to have so much as a suspition of hir thus proceeding upon any other score) suddenly seized upon both hir hands, and after commanding one of his Guards to search hir, and to take the cause of hir Confidence away, he told hir with a furious look; The certainty of that Sanctuary which made you with such insolence despise me, & my Flame, is not in your Power, and you are in mine; so that what you refus'd with scorn, if you implor'd with Tears I would now deny unto you, in the same manner you declyn'd the aceptance of it from me, nor can the contept you have endeavor'd to throw upon my Crown be justlier Reveng'd, than by the Power of it, which by all that's Holy, shall no longer beg, what it can take. Thereupon, with a Countenance which relisht nothing but of Fury, and Lust, he commanded those which waited on him, to clear the Room of all but Parthenissa; which was going to be put in practise, when he that Arsaces had commanded to search, and Disarm hir, told him, there was nothing about hir which could destroy hir Life, for the certaintie of which, he engaged his own. This strange assurance made all the Tyrant's other Passions resigne themselves into Admiration, & that suddenly yielded it self unto Ioy; for he believ'd Parthenissa had acted the Part of Despair, as a last essay, and then was resolv'd to yield to what she could not resist; This flattering Faith was created in him, by hir having no visible means to resist his Power, in a time, when he had solemnly sworn to conquer hir with it, if by his Passion & Perseverance, he did not doe it by then. Neither did the fair Parthenissa's silence all this while a little contribute to this belief; but alas, hirs proceeded from an other Cause, for by this, the Poyson had made its fatall Approches, so near the throne of Life, that the hand of Death began to draw an obscure vail over the vitall spirits, and so greedily to seize on the Noble dwelling of a Nobler soul, that Arsaces had scarcely prostrated himself on his knees, to make Parthenissa those retributions, the joy of his last faith, had made him esteem so just a Debt, when she began to retire to a Pallet, which she had no sooner reach'd, than she fell on it, and having breathed a sigh, and indistinctly Pronounc'd your generous Prince's Name, the Beauties of Vermillion, resign'd their Empire to the colour of Innocence, the fairest lights which ever did, or shall shine, became Eclips'd with an eternall Night, and the Admirable soul, of a bodie that was so, took her flight to an other, but could not to a Fairer Dwelling. Here the faithfull Symander was so vanquish'd with his own relation, that he had not the power to continue it; neither had his generous Hearers that of desiring him to do it, for they were so sensibly affected with this deplorable and fatall part of his Storie, that their Curiositie resign'd its room unto their sorrow, to which they so justly and unconfin'dly abandon'd themselves, that they fully justified the vast grief of Artabbanes, since they resenting so much only by their being Hearers of the Loss, they could not but expect much more from him that was the sufferer of it: At length they were so much friends to their Grief, that they conjur'd the afflicted Symander by a continuance of his Storie, to divert them in some degree, from their being so intent on that sad part of it. Symander, to obey this Command, by many strugglings with his grief, finally obtain'd so much the victorie over it, as thus to prosecute what he had brought so near to a conclusion: This relation of the fair Parthenissa's Death, which invaded you with so high a sorrow, had so resembling an operation on the unconsolable Emilia, that it was above an hour before hir tears and sighes would permit hir to continue hir relation, which she did in these tearms: As soon as the Barbarous Arsaces saw the fair Parthenissa pale and breathless, he became so too, and continu'd so long in that condition, that I began to think, Grief had perform'd the office of Iustice, and had alone payd that debt to the Tyrant, which all the world does ow him; But he soon return'd again from his seeming Death, but it was to act such violences on himself, that I thought his recoverie was a more signall punishment, than his dying could have prov'd; In a word, who ever had seen the demonstration of his sorrow, would have concluded he was the sufferer, not the Author of the Loss. At length (tir'd with the actings of his grief) he continu'd quiet for a time, and then ran to Zephalinda, at whose feet prostrating himself, he conjur'd hir to tell him, whether the Fears of his violence, had cast Patthenissa into a seeming, or had made hir cast hir self into a reall death: But this fair Princess gave him an answer by a demonstration, for in that moment of time, the fatall Poyson had so far conquer'd hir heart, that she had only life enough left to recover the Pallet on which the dead Parthenissa lay, and in embracing, and kissing hir, to expire, as if she ambition'd in the last act of hir life, to evince the perfect friendship she had payd hir thorough the whole course of it. At this second death, Arsaces's grief turn'd into furie, he began to believe himself so horrid a Murtherer, that who ever he spake unto, was instantly struck with Death, which though true, had bin a punishment inferior to his Sin; and in this belief, he ran frantick up and down the Chamber, crying in the perfect accent and voyce of horror and despair, Gods! give me Parthenissa again, give me Parthenissa again; and after a thousand friutless offers of seizing on the Swords of some of his Guards, he at length ran his head with so much violence against the angle of that great Cabinet which stood by the Pallet on which the dead Parthenissa lay, that he thereby not only reciev'd a large hurt, but fell speechless & senceless at Parthenissa's Feete, where he continu'd groveling in his bloud, till his Guards carryed him into his own Appartment to have him drest. Here (said Symander to his generous Hearers) the fair Emilia ended hir relation, and began again hir weeping in such excess, that it even brought an accession of grief, to that which invaded me by hir fatall Relation: Neither doe I believe she would have ended hir Tears, but with hir life, had not hir care of Artabbanes bin greater than any she had of hir self; For remebring one of hir Princesse's last injunctions to hir, was to let Artabbanes know her last to him, was, a passionat desire of pardoning hir Murtherer, & a more passionate one, of surviving hir Murther, that as she carryed into the other World the highest modell and example of a perfect Love, so that he would continue the like in this; and that Parthia was miserable enough in suffering hir Kings Sin, without the addition of enduring the punishment of it; she conjur'd me to assume that employment, whilst she would pay the dead Princesses, the duty of Funerall (if hir grief left hir life enough to doe it, which she hoped, yet fear'd it would.) Emilia further enjoyn'd me by an immediate return to Artabbanes, to prevent the same of Parthenissa's death, and by my acquainting him with hir last desires, endeavour to prevent his. This I esteem'd so necessary, that after having at Parthenissa's and Zephalinda's Feet, payd the tribute of my Tears, and as much as I was capable of, attempted to lessen the fair Emilia's, I went to Sillaces, and after to Lindadory's Appartment, where alas, I learn'd that in the confusion of the late disorders, she had bin carryed away by some Arm'd, and unknown persons, and that the generous Sillaces with what friends he could assemble in so short a warning, was gone after hir Ravishers. With these accessionall griefs, of the unhappiness of my Prince's Sister, and of my failing of so necessary and powerfull Consolers as I was confident Lindadory & Sillaces would have bin to Artabbanes, I directed my steps to him, but with a heart so replenisht with sadness, that nothing could in degrees equall it, but the justice with which it was so. You may (generous Hearers) in some proportion imagin the strangeness of my then employment, when I knew not whether I ought more to apprehend that any other should give my Prince the fatall Intelligence of his Misery, or that I should; but the second day I came to the place of his residence, where the horror which possest me by the perfect knowledge I had of what his sorrows would be, at the information I was to give him, so vanquisht all those resolutions I had assum'd during my journey, that not only I invok'd death as a pleasing expedient to have declined it, but would have made use of it, had not I fear'd that Artabbanes by my that way of avoyding telling him his loss, might have receiv'd it worse, than by a verball doing it. But though this faith tied up my hand, yet by those sudden, & various emotions which did agitate me, I felt a burning shoot into my veyns, and that at first with such violence, that I was in hope the feaver would confer that obligation on me which my affection to my Prince hinder'd me from conferring on my self; or at least if his despair for the deprivation of Parthenissa were greater than his obediece to hir, my sickness would enable me to wait on him, without the help of my resolution, or duty. At length (generous Hearers) at length I came into Artabbanes's Chamber, and though it were in high tremblings, with a pale look, and in vast disorders, yet they hardly equal'd my Princes's at the sight of mine: That generous Courage which had so often out-braved Death in all its horrors, which had so often unmoved endur'd, nay courted the highest dangers, was now conquer'd and yielded unto the bare signes of sorrow in another; but alas, they were signes so clear, and evident, of the only way in which fortune, or the Gods had power to invade him, that in my being uncapable to tell him his loss, he did but too-plainly read it. But at last, when Artabbanes perceiv'd that I had the power by words to acquaint him, with what my emotions made him apprehend was the cause of them, he told me; Are not the Gods yet (Symander) weary of persecuting the miserable Artabbanes, by the punishments they have impos'd upon him, but that they must also afflict him more cruelly, & sensibly through Parthenissa? for doubtless thy grief is too-great for any misery which can wound me, but through hir: Has any of my Ryvalls by force, or delusion, got hir again into their power? or has hir justice now discover'd those defects in the over-valu'd Artabbanes, which hir mercy so long hinder'd hir from seeing and punishing? speak I conjure thee, for thy looks have as much of miserie for me, as my Fate can impose upon me. Alas Sir (I reply'd) I must confess, your Ryvalls have at length got the success, but 'tis not your old ones have done it, they have bin but instruments to convey hir from themselves, as well as you; Your present Ryvalls are such, that 'tis as great a Sin, as impossibilitie to resist them; in the infelicitie of your Love, the excellenie of your choice is manifested, and in the highest misery of Love, you have the highest occasio of evidencing yours hath bin the most pure, and most excellent; for if in your Passion, you were only concern'd in the object of it, she is now in joyes, which will be so far from clouding yours, that they will be as uncapable of increase, as of change: You have now Sir, no more the occasion of repining for the unequall'd Parthenissa, since the Gods, who deny'd hir you, but to possess hir themselves, have thereby taken from you the justice of such a proceeding; and have confin'd you if you grieve, to evidence 'tis for your self, not hir; who believing you were of a contrary principle, and that hir felicitie would create yours, staid not till your new Ryvalls called hir, but elected to go to them. Thereupon I told him particularly all that I had seen, and all that I heard from Emilia; but I had no sooner ended this fatall relation (what through the indisposition which then invaded me, what through the horror and grief which I saw invade my generous Prince) than I fell at his feet, and though my sences at that instant did not abandon me, yet it was but to be the more cruell, and the more tormenting; for I saw and heard, that after Artabbanes had fetch'd a groan from the bottom of his heart, which shewed the greatness of it, by its being capable to cotain so much, he cry'd out; You are dead fair Princess, you are dead! and you dyed for Artabbanes: ah too-great & too-ungratefull heart, which canst know this, & yet canst live after it; but I will puish thee for needing any help but thy own to act thy dutie; yes ungratefull heart, thy debt to my Princess shall be paid, though not by thee, My Resolution shall have the glory of that performance, since thou hast declin'd it, or at least art so long in acting it. Thereupon he ran furiously to his sword, and having drawn it, resting the hilt upon the ground, and leaning the point to his Breast, he cry'd out; Divine Parthenissa! what you have done, leaves the miserable Artabbanes nothing to do, but to admire, and follow you, the first he has still perform'd, and the last he now performs. These words were no sooner utter'd, than by falling on his sword, I saw the fatall point of it, having pierc'd his bodie, appear all bloudie, as if it blush'd at the sin it had acted. Oh Gods! (Symander cry'd out) why did you give me life enough to see, and not life enough to prevent it? and yet it might be just in them, that for my being griev'd they were happier than my Prince, I should behold & not hinder his despair. But Artabbanes, who knew how requisite death was to his condition, and how opposite I would be to that only cure, as if having opened two doors for his Soul to free hir self from that dark Prison she had bin confin'd unto, were not enough, he striv'd to employ that little life was left, to take even that little totally away; & doubtless had repeated his wounds, if my horror thereat, had not given me a supernaturall strength, & enabled me on my hands, and knees, to crawl to him, and to seize upon the hilts of his sword, on which I took such sure hold, that spight of all his struglings, I kept him from additionall wounds, & by my loud & reitterated cries, drew some of the people of the house to my assistance, who with me, by meer force wrested the fatall weapon out of his hands; which being effected, my Prince with a Look in which a crowd of different passions were distinctly visible, told me, And is Symander too become my Enemie? ah! if thou hast a hatred for Artabbanes, canst thou more signally satisfie it than to see him send himself out of the World? and if thou hast a Friendship for him, why dost thou retard his following Parthenissa? with that fair Name his Sences abandon'd him, and left his body inviron'd in that deluge of bloud, which had flowed out of it. This Swounding, which at first made me tremble, soon after made me rejoyce; for thereby the Chyrurgion (who then came) without resistance search'd, and dreft his wounds, & having layd him in his bed, they there endeavor'd by powerfull Cordialls to recall that life, which seemingly had forsaken him. I caus'd them to lay me in a Pallet contiguous to my Prince's bed, where in expectatios, which ravish'd from me all sence of my own condition, I waited for the effects of the Chyrurgions Art and prescriptions: But alas, the fear I assum'd that death had eternally closed his Eyes, could not transcend my grief, when that apprehension vanisht; for the first proof he gave of life, was an action which sadly demonstrated, how intent he was on the destroying of his; for finding his wounds bound, he tore away all things the Chyrurgions had apply'd to them, and endeavor'd to make his hands finish, what his cruell Sword had but begun; But those I had order'd to watch and hinder the effects of his despair, by plain force, and by my command, held his hands; at which he assum'd so high a rage, that in words deliver'd with much more strength than I thought he had bin Master of, he told me; Cruell Symander, and much more cruell than Fortune, yea than Arsaces himself, they but make the highest cure necessary, but thou after it is so, do'st deny it me. I conjure thee by that love thou once did'st pay me, by that adoration I pay my divine Princess, who I now behold clothed with more Glory, than she has bin with misfortune, and by those Tears (unusuall Advocats for me) permit me to follow hir: with that he shed such a shower of them, that I was for a time unable to answer him in any other language, which my Prince perceiving he told me; Canst thou then Symander, give me the highest signes of pitty, and deny me the least act of it? and canst thou be sensible of my miseries, and deny me their only Cure? Ah Sir (I reply'd) what is become of that Fortitude, which in all the strangest, and intricatest Revolutions, and vicissitudes of Fortue, has alwayes made you triumphant over hir? has it abandon'd you, or have you abandon'd it, in a season where it was most necessary? What will the World believe to your prejudice, when you your self act so much to it? your virtue which now is the admiration of all, will be believ'd the mistake of all; for when any thing can befall it greater than it self, 'twill be thought it hath acquired its glory, not from its own stregth, but fro the weakness of its opposers. Hold thy Peace (said my Prince interrupting me) hold thy Peace, 'tis no wonder thou hast lost thy concern for me, when thou hast lost thy reason, which if thou hadst not, thou could'st not but see, that that fortitude thou so flatterest me with, never aspir'd at so certain a felicity, as thy cruelty hinders hir from possessing: That which thy Madness tearms despair, my reason tearms fortitude; which high virtue is not given us to continue our miseries, but to overcome them: Mine are of so peculiar a quality, that if my fortitude should continue my Life, 'twould act against it self, as much as against me: No Symander, my Fortitude never so well deserved that Name, as now that it has made me chearfully elect to act my owne death, which certainly cannot be a sin, since 'twill reunite me to the divine Parthenissa: had the Gods design'd me Life, they would not have taken away hirs; and the duty of not killing my self, by which I must be banish'd from my Princess, cannot be so great as that of killing my self, to be restor'd unto hir. But Sir (I reply'd) what Face can you present your self to your Princess with, when to act your satisfaction, you decline your duty? and leave this world without revenging your self on him, who sent hir out of it, and divested you of all Felicity in it. This (said Symander) I spake in expectation that such a duty might qnalifie for the present the violence of his despair, & that time might silence it in the future; but alas, I soon found the vanitie of that hope, by my Kings thus answering me: If I were not certain 'twere a higher Mercie to kill one of my Princess's Votaries after hir death, than not to doe it; I would not beg the blessing to become my own executioner, and therefore I will not so much oblige the Tyrant, as to become his: The Gods who know the greatest Crime merits the greatest punishment, doe now evince that truth on that Monster; For the certaintie that to be the fair Parthenissa's executioner, is the greatest Sin, cannot be a greater Truth, than after having acted it, 'tis the greatest punishment to want fortitude to be his own; and since Life is the torment of my Princess's Murtherer, how can it be the satisfaction of hir adorer? besides, I am confin'd, and I believe on this score of hir last commands, from embruing my hands in his Bloud. So you are (I reply'd) from embruing your hands in your own, and that request, nay rather command, impos'd with much more earnestness than the other; ah Sir, consider how much your despair offences your Love, and how unlike this proceeding is to any other of yours, where your Princess's commands have acted you? you can decline becoming the executioner of hir Murtherer to obey hir, and you will not decline becoming your own, when you have a higher confinement to it: this is not to obey hir, but your self, or rather your despair, by going to hir in the other world, when she orders your continuance in this, and when that order was pronounced with hir last breath, you shew you value something above hir comands, which is a crime you have hitherto declin'd with so much care, and she has acknowledg'd with so many Elogies, that your now running into it, evinces nothing so pregnantly, as that hir Memorie has not the same Ascendant over you, which hir Life had, though she lost hirs, but to continue the more gloriously in yours; consider too, I beg you Sir, that the more painfull the obedience is, the more meritorious 'tis; that common obeyings are not fit sacrifices for Artabbanes to offer, or Parthenissa to receive, and that the crime of disobedience cannot be the way to so admirable end, as is your reunion with hir: Yes Sir, I tremble to think how she will receive you, when the last act of your Life, is a violation of the last command of hirs. Thou dost delude thy self Symander, thou dost delude thy self (said my King, interrupting me) the Divine Parthenissa knew too-well the greatness of hir loss, and the just sence I should have of it, to enjoyn me the impossibilitie of surviving it: I rather ascribe that to thy crueltie, than hir commands; or if she impos'd that on me which thou sayst she did, it was but the better to illustrate the vastness of my Love, which by contemning my own Life, hir Revenge, and my dutie to hir commands, manifests it is superior to all those: so that by my Death, I shall but evince a truth I most ambition'd in my Life; nay, which at any time I would have laid down to witness; which is, that my Love was as much above all other concerns, as the Beautie which inspir'd it was above all which ever inspir'd that Passion: Let not then thy cruelty denie my Flame, the most glorious manifestation of it; nor let me derive that from Time, and from Torments, which my resolution is so obligingly readie to confer on me without any; nor flatter thy self with believing Time can change a resolution, which is as irrevocable, as that misfortune which has made me so justly assue it: no Symander, thou mayst tie my hands, thou mayst hinder them from acting my Death, but thou canst not hinder me from dying; for I here solenly protest by the highest powers, & by my Princess who has increased their number, that I will neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep, 'till the want of those confer that felicity on me, which thou hast so barbarously deny'd me. Then turning himself from me, in a shower of Tears, he seem'd to continue those reproches which they had interrupted. I cannot (generous Hearers, continu'd Symander) acquaint you with what grief I entertain'd this vow of my Kings; I knew his resolution too-well, and the power he thus had to act it, not to tremble when he pronounced it, and if at first I had any consolation, it proceeded from an unremoved resolve of sharing in his despair, if at last I could not silence it; but this being a thing which related to my self only, was soon expell'd by a throng of cares, which my duty to Artabbanes introduced, who continued so cruelly true to his vow, that for four and twenty hours after he had made it, not all my Prayers, and Tears, could invite him to take any refreshment by food or sleep, by which he was so extreamly weakened, that he had not life enough so long again to repeat his abstinence, which when I tould him in sighs, and weepings, he answer'd me only in smiles, & by them seem'd to tell me, that though his way of dying were not so expeditious as that I had deny'd him, yet it was as certain. In this unequall'd misery, when both my reason and my hope had resign'd themselves unto despair, the Gods inspir'd me with an invention which 'till now I never did discover, and which but to you I would not. Symander having nicely look'd whether any were in the Chamber, & whether his Prince were within hearing in the Gallery, and being satisfied negativly of both, thus resum'd his discourse; I knew too-well my Kings despair was so great, that no remedy which was not so, could suppress it, and that his vows were not to be cancel'd, but by those to whom they were addrest; 'twas therefore, that calling to me a Youth which belong'd to the house in which we lay, and who during Artabbanes's indisposition, had shew'd so much concern in it, and care for him, that I concluded him fit for any employment conducible to his recovery I enjoyned him in the blackest hour of Night, to conceal himself behind the hangings, which was next my Princes bed, and by unriping a part of it, to convey a hollow Cane, as near Artabbaes's Ear as he could, without puting it within the reach of his hands, and then in- a counterfeit hollow voyce, to speak thrice (and with some good intervall) these ensuing words; Artabbanes, go to Hierapolis, there consult, and obey the Oracle . The time to execute this being come, which was three hours after it was design'd, and indeed my Prince's condition could not well admit of a much longer delay, the faithfull Youth had so well fitted all things, and so excellently disguis'd his voyce, that I almost began to believe, the Gods (who knew nothing but themselves, had the power to suspend that despair, they had involv'd him in) had undertook that Iustice: As soon as Artabbanes heard the voyce, he called me,  & told me, Symander, does my Fancy conspire with thee, and with Fortune? or doe I really hear a voyce, which commands me an obedience more cruell than thy late usage? I was about to reply, when the second time, the first words were repeated, and they were no sooner ended than I cry'd out as surpriz'd; At length Sir, at length, you see my endeavour to hinder your despair, was not my Sin, for if it had bin one, the Gods would not have imitated me; nor can you any longer doubt their care, when to evince it, they make use even of a Miracle. He was about to have reply'd, when the voyce the third time enjoyn'd what it had twice before; after which Artabbanes cry'd, No Symander, I never doubted of their care, nor of their making use of Miracles to shew it, but then that care, and those Miracles were only to torment me: Ah Gods! how can you, having done so little for me, expect so much from me? and why do you enjoyn me life, when you have not only taken from me all the Felicities, but also left me all the Torments of it? Ah Sir (I reply'd) the reason of Man is too-short, & dull to reach and pierce the wayes and Providence of the Gods, which commonly delight to contradict, & cross what we do seem most cofident of, partly by shewing us the uncertaintie of humane things, to wean us from them; partly to have us center wholly in their power, which such a dealing is no ill way unto: Thus have the greatest Miseries bin as often cur'd, as the greatest Ioyes have bin extinguish'd. Whilst Parthenissa was alive (said Artabbanes) that is, whilst there was a possibilitie I might be happie, I did undergo all my afflictions with a silence, great as themselves, and with a resignation which shewed I knew the ambition of my Flame, deserv'd those sufferings, which I alone ascrib'd to that cause: But now the cruell Gods have made my miseries past their power to cure; with what justice can they hope to retain so much Empire over me, as to expect I should act a performance they themselves cannot reward? & how can the destroying of so unfortunate a Life be esteem'd a crime? for where an obedience is above recompence, the disobedience cannot merit punishment; No Symander, I rather believe they command me to continue in this Life, that I may not see my loss in the next; for what Surena and Arsaces have bin to me in this world, the Gods are in the other. If they are Sir (I reply'd) then Parthenissa governs them, and consequently she would not permit them to command you a fruitless Miserie. Alas (said Artabbanes) dost thou not know, that though my earthly Ryvalls did adore hir, yet they did persecute me? why may not I expect from Heaven the like effects, from the like Cause? No Sir (I answer'd) for whilst the fair Parthenissa's Soul was inviron'd with an earthly dwelling, she could not see so clear as now she is all Spirit; so that now you need not doubt hir knowledge to foresee your ills, nor hir power to prevent them; and therefore you have nothing to doe in this command, but to obey it: I am confident Sir, this miraculous injunction proceeds entirely from your Princess's care; your now Ryvalls, if you made your own execution the way to hir, might denie you the end you thereby expect, and that too without making any new Laws, but by their observing those to which all Mortalls are confin'd; perhaps she has represented so truly your Miseries, that she has procur'd a command to the Oracle of Hierapolis, to ordain you by death to put a period to them, that thereby the guilt of the performance may be taken away, and consequently the punishment, which doubtless she apprehends as much upon hir own score, as yours. If that were so (said my King) why did not the same voice which enjoyn'd me to seek my Death (for that only can be my cure) at Hierapolis, command, or at least permit me to act it here? The cause Sir (I reply'd) is evident; Every common Lover, in the first dictates which his Mistris's death inspires him with, would flie unto that cure you now are so intent upon: But when you do evince, that Time which heals all others griefs, does but increase yours, and that every moment your Princess's death makes you willing & readie to act your own; that will evidence your Love and Sorrow equall their causes, & that the effects of your Passion are as peculiar, as the Beautie which inspir'd it: Even Arsaces would, in the first furie of Parthenissa's Loss, have done as much as you: shall the deprived hopes of a vitious Flame, have as high a production as those of a virtuous one? ah Sir, provoke not the world so much to mistake the nature of your grief, as to give them but equall illustrations; shew us what was but fury in the Tyrant, is reason in you, by acting your Death for Parthenissa's, when he has forgotten hirs: The highest production of grief being to die, and he having elected that, you have no way, but by Time, to make the difference: It would cloud the beautie of your performance, if it were in the heat of your Loss, and make that look but like the greatest Rage, which is the greatest Love. I should be endless (generous Hearers) did I tell you all our reasonings, 'tis enough you know, that at length I obtain'd the victorie, and that which chiefly gave it me, were the two inducements I mention'd last. I must not omit acquainting you, that I elected the Oracle of Hierapolis for the place where my King was to learn his Fate, not only because it was the most celebrated in all Asia, but also because it was so distant from the place we then were in, that it would necessitate him to a perfect recoverie, to enable him to perform the journey. Never any man lost his health with more unwillingness, than Artabbanes recover'd his; and those things prescrib'd him he took in such a way, as manifested Life was his obedience, nor desire: Should I tell you all his extravagant reasonings, his vows of acting his own death, if the Oracle gave him any ambiguous answer, & his high repinings against the Gods, for having kept the power of punishing, when they had lost that of rewarding him, I should injure your patience too- much; in apprehension I have done so alreadie: I shall conclude all by acquainting you, that I wonder'd he had so much obedience for those Powers for whom he had so little respect; to whose providence he yet owed the recoverie of his wounds, which being so well clos'd as to permit him to ride, we began our journey, which was the saddest that ever was perform'd; for my King for the most part kept a deep silence, and when at any time he broke it, it was in sighs and groans, or in repeating the fan Name of Parthenissa, evidencing thereby, that she only occasion'd them. The third Night we came into a Village, whither after Artabbanes was gone into his Chamber, there came certain Gentlemen from Selutia all in mourning, of whom I had the curiosity to enquire what News that place afforded; one of them told me, that the Death of the Princess Parthenissa and the Princess Zephalinda a took up all the sorrow and business of the Court, and that Arsaces continu'd in as deep a Melancholly, as if the cause of it had bin recent; that he had lately celebrated their Funeralls distinctly: That though Zephalinda's was with much solemnitie & State, yet Parthenissa's was with much more: & that in imitation of Alexanders Funeralls for Hephestion, Arsaces had caus'd all the Spiers, the Pinacles, and the Battlements, both of the Temples and the Pallaces, in Babilon, Niniveh, and Selutia, to be beaten down; and order'd that all in his Empire (which were able) should for the revolution of twelve Moons wear close Mourning; That he had caus'd Parthenissa's Statue to be made by an admirable Artist, which he had erected at the end of a large Gallery all hung with black, which had no other light but what it receiv'd from one hundred christall Lamps, whose flames were continually fed by an artificiall oyl, which hardly admitted of any diminution: That at the feet of this Statue, he had plac'd his own, kneeling, weeping, and fixing his Eyes on that Beautie's, who seem'd to have communicated to the Alablaster hir living insensibility: That every day when Arsaces's grief gave him strength to visit this Gallery, he constantly spent half of it, at the fair Princess's feet, & imitated or relieved his Statue: This Gentleman further told me, that though these Deaths, and this strange way of deploring them in Orodes, left little room for other sorrows, or discourses, yet some there were, who did both grieve, and wonder, at the strange forcing of the Princess Lindadory's Pallace, at hir being carryed away by unknown persons, and at the not hearing since what was become of hir, or the Prince Sillaces, who the same Night had follow'd hir Ravishers. This News (continu'd Symander) I thought unfit to communicate to my Prince, lest it might bring an accession to that grief, whose extinction was my highest care. The next morning therefore we continu'd our journey with our accustomed silence; but when we came within a dayes journey of this Palace, there happen'd an accident which I cannot but acquaint you with. Not far from the Road in which we travell'd, near the side of a little Grove, we discover'd eight Horsemen, who assaulted a Gentleman that defended himself with so much resolution, as shew'd the difference of the numbers did but render the Combat equall. My Prince mov'd with the generous Strangers Courage, and apprehending at length he might stand in need of his, pulling down the sight of his Helmet, with his Sword drawn he gallop'd up to him just as one of his Enemies had kill'd his horse, by whose fall he was so much disorder'd, that had not Artabbanes by a furious blow kill'd one of those who prest him the most, the Stranger undoubtedly had exchang'd Fates with his Enemie: Artabbanes having thus reliv'd a danger which was impossible any other way to be effected, suspending his Sword in the Ayr, and commanding me to doe the like with mine, addrest himself to one who seem'd to be the chief of those who had begun so unequall a Combate, and told him; Though I am ignorant in the cause of your Quarrell, yet I have some reason to suspect it is not just, because you depend upon your numbers for your success; yet if you please to acquaint me with it, I will ingage my self no longer to defend your enemie, than I finde my self confin'd unto it, by the duty of Iustice. Who ever thou art (the other reply'd with an insolent tone) who hast made thy self my Enemie, and then wouldst have me make thee my Iudge, know our difference does not concern thee; but since thou hast made thy self so much a Partie, I will make my self the Iudge, and doe condemn thee to share in that death, thou vainly enendeavour'st to hinder. Thereupon he darted his Iavelin at my Prince, who receiv'd it in his shield, and then charg'd him so briskly, that he found his courage proportion'd his insolencie; this usage had no unfruitfull return, and though it deserv'd a signall punishment, yet he receiv'd an honor that was so, dying by the hand of Artabbanes. By this time the Stranger had mounted himself, upon the Horse of the first man that was killed, & furiously thrusting into the midst of his enemies, by two unresistable blowes, lessen'd as many of their number; the rest amazed at our assistance, and at those admirable deaths, made so faint a defence, that the Combat soon ended, with their Lives. The Stranger then lifting up his Helmet, which was shaded with a great Plume of Feathers of Aurora colour, as his Armour was of the like, and garnish'd with such refulgent Stones, as sufficiently manifested their Master was of no small Qualitie, came to Artabbanes with so much Grace, and Majestie, that I was charm'd with it, and told him; Generous Stranger, I ow you my Life, and will at any time pay you that debt with as much satisfaction as I contracted it; but I must beg your Pardon if a consideration much higher than my Life does now force me from you, which I should acquaint you with, did I not justly fear the time it would take up, would hinder me from paying a dutie to a Princess, who before the obligation you placed on me, merited all Mine, and even yet does merit the most of it: But that I may not hereafter be guiltie of that ingratitude, which my highest concern makes me seem guiltie of now, I must desire to know my Protectors Name, that when the Beautie I serve has no further employment for my Sword, & Life, I may know where to offer both, to him, to whom I acknowledge I ow them, and for whom I will with much more joy employ them. Artabbanes, extreamly satisfied with this Gallantrie, and as much mov'd with the Cause of that haste the Stranger seem'd to be in, reply'd; My Name, generous Stranger, is as unconsiderable as the little service you are pleas'd to think I did you; But were it as great as your acknowledgements, I should yet conceal it, lest you might thereby believe I pretended to a debt, you have but too-abundantly satisfi'd alreadie: You retribute so much for so little, and you thereby appear so worthy to be oblig'd, that I cannot but offer you my service in the relief of that Princess you are so intent upon, the inequallitie of your late combat, makes me believe your Enemies are not acted by the principles of Honor, and therefore if not for your own sake, yet for hirs you so much value, and who perhaps sets a greater rate upon your Life, than you do on your own, refuse not the assistance of a sword which has bin fortunate enough against all, but him that wears it. This strange conclusion had doubtless given the Stranger a Curiositie of desiring to know what occasion'd it, if the great haste he was in had not supprest it, which was such, that it hardly gave him leasure to make this Reply; You cannot be so unjust to your self, and me, as to conceal your Name upon the score you mention, and therefore I believe some high cause invites you to it, which shall suspend my desire of learning it; Your virtue I am confident will guide me to you as certainly as your Name, and upon better considerations; that way of enquiring after you, will be more Noble, and as sure: I confess I have the high Felicitie of being valued by the Beautie I adore, and the misfortune of having an Enemie and Ryvall, who cares not by what wayes he reaches his ends; but by your valour you have cut off his chiefest assistance, and his Crimes are such, that I should injure the justice of the Gods, if I thought a single sword which strikes with Iustice, were not able to act my Revenge, & my Princess's Deliverance: Besides, I am so much your debtor both by act and offer, that I should give my self a greater trouble by becoming more so, than by undertaking alone the destruction of those few Enemies your Courage has left me. That is a consideration (said Artabbanes) which your civilitie only has rais'd; but your valor is such, that by those effects of it which I have seen, I can hardly doubt of any other; I will therefore only beg your pardon for having done your Ryvall more service by delaying you, than I have done you, in endeavouring to assist you; and that you will give me so obliging a Proof of your having granted it me, as the acquainting me with your name. I should obey you (said the Stranger) if it were not to make my self fruitlessly known unto you, which would be a manifesting of my self too-low, both for the obligation, & the sence I have of them: Permit me therefore to decline that honor 'till I derive it from my services, which I will seek you over all the world to pay you, as soon as I am put into a capacity of doing it, by having pay'd mine unto my Princess, the necessity of whose condition I beg may appologize for my now leaving you, which nothing else could make me hope for, or invite me to. Thereupon saluting my Prince with much humility, and haste, he turn'd about his horse and follow'd the Tract of a Charriot with such celerity, that we soon lost sight of him. Artabbanes was so much taken with the good Meen and civility of the generous Stranger, & so sympathiz'd in his concerns, that he suspended his usuall melancholly to entertain me with them, which yet he did but for a little time, and then in his accustomed manner, continu'd his journey hither, where we arriv'd without meeting any thing else worthy your knowledge, and where my King has receiv'd an Oracle, which makes me hope what I consider'd as an invention of mine, was an inspiration of the Gods. 'Twas thus Symander ended the History of his Kings Life, and then beg'd Pardon from his generous Hearers for the length of his Relation, & for all those faults he had bin, or those omissions he might be guilty of. Artavasdes and Callimmachus having both tooke notice with much civility of Symander, and acknowledged how well he had acquitted himself, went to Artabbanes in the Gallery, who though they found in an excess of sadness, yet by the knowledge of its cause, they were so far from condemning, that they participated in it. But the good Callimmachus, who knew the Gods promises to him, & their power of performing them, on those two Subjects, endeavour'd by the assistance of Artavasdes, to change his sorrow into Faith, which yet prov'd but a fruitless attempt; For Artabbanes knew the utmost extension of Faith was to act above reason not against it, and therefore found in his own condition, too-high a certainty of its admiting a change. Severall dayes were spent in such successless employments, and to recover the two Princes out of a dangerous relapse, into which they were fallen, whose cure had retarded their intended Sacrifice ordain'd them by the Oracle: but Callimmachus finding the Princes in perfect health, and esteeming it high time to obey the imporsition of the Gods, as also believing the Beauties of a little Forrest in which the Temple of Adonis and the Vestall Nunns stood, might be some diversion to their sorrows, invited them thither; It was not above forty furlongs from the Temple of Hierapolis, and a place of so much delight, that a Melancholly which was capable of ease might be certain of receiving it there. Artavasdes, who burnt with impatience to make a journey into Parthia, to offer his Sword & Life unto Altezeera, which the words of one of his dying Enemies made him apprehend she stood in need of, would before this invitation have gone whither his love, and duty called him, had his health permitted it; but now it did, and Artabbanes also (who he was unexpressibly troubl'd to leave:) a new difficulty arose which was like to interrupt his voyage for a few days, which was, that those Arms he had wore at his coming to the Temple, were too rich, and too well known to his Parthian Enemies (as by a fatall experiment it had near bin demonstrated) to travell with them into a Country where his only safety would consist in his not being discover'd: To redress which inconveniency, he was forced to bespeak less rich Arms in the Citie of Hierapolis (which is not a
